Naples is built on the northern shore of the bay You will see by the map on the preceding page just what the situation of the town is, and where Vesuvius is in relation to it. Vesuvius, you observe, stands back a little from the sea, but the slope of land extends quite down to the margin of the water. You perceive, however, that there is a carriage road, and also a railroad, passing along the coast between the mountain and the sea.  Besides the villages and towns laid down on the map, upon this coast, there are many little hamlets scattered along the way, so that, as seen across the water from Naples, there seems to be, as it were, a continued town, extending along the whole line of the shore.  Among the places named on the map you see the sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii marked. Pompeii lies to the south-east from the mountain, and Herculaneum to the south-west. Of course the lava, in breaking out from the crater in different eruptions, runs down the mountain, sometimes on one side and sometimes on another. It is the same with the showers of stones and ashes, which are carried in different directions, according to the course of the wind.  Very near the site of Herculaneum you see a small town laid down, named Resina. This is the place where people stop when about to make the ascent of Vesuvius, and leave the carriage in which they came from Naples. If they come by the railroad, they leave the train at the Portici station, which, also, you will see upon the map, and thence go to Resina by a carriage.  At Resina they take another carriage, or sometimes go on in the same, until they get up to what is called the Hermitage, the place of which you also see marked on the map. The Hermitage is so called because the spot was once the residence of a monk who lived there alone in his cell. It is now, however, a sort of ruin.  There is no carriage road at all beyond the Hermitage, and here, accordingly, the party of travellers take mules or donkeys, to go on some distance farther. At last they reach a part of the mountain which is so steep that even mules and donkeys cannot go; and here the people are accordingly obliged to dismount, and to climb up the last part of the ascent on foot, or else to be carried up in a chair, which is the mode usually adopted for ladies. You will see how Mr. George and Rollo managed, in the next chapter.  The ruins of Herculaneum can be visited on the same day in which you make the ascent of Vesuvius; for, as you see by the map, they are very near the place, Resina, where the ascent of the mountain commences. Pompeii, however, is much farther on, and usually requires a separate day.  Besides, it takes much longer to visit Pompeii than Herculaneum, on account of there being go much more to see there. The reason for this is, that the excavations have been carried on much farther at Pompeii than at Herculaneum. Herculaneum was buried up in lava, and the lava, when it cooled, became as hard as a stone; whereas Pompeii was only covered with ashes and cinders, which are very easily dug away.  Besides, Herculaneum was buried very deep, so that, in order to get to it, you have to go far down under ground. The fact that there was an ancient city buried there was discovered about a hundred and fifty years ago, by a man digging a well in the ground above. In digging this well, the workmen came upon some statues and other remains of ancient art. They dug these things out, and afterwards the excavations were continued for many years; but the difficulties in the way were so great, on account of the depth below the surface of the ground where the work was to be done, and also on account of the hardness of the lava, that after a while it was abandoned. People, however, now go down sometimes through a shaft made near the well by which the first discovery was made, and ramble about, by the light of torches, which they carry with them, among the rubbish in the subterranean chambers.  The site of Pompeii was discovered in the same way with Herculaneum, namely, by the digging of a well. Pompeii, however, as has already been said, was not buried nearly as deep as Herculaneum, and the substances which covered it were found to be much softer, and more easily removed. Consequently a great deal more has been done at Pompeii than at Herculaneum in making excavations. Nearly a third of the whole city has now been explored, and the work is still going on.  The chief inducement for continuing to dig out these old ruins, is to recover the various pictures, sculptures, utensils, and other curious objects that are found in the houses. These things, as fast as they are found, are brought to Naples, and deposited in an immense museum, which has been built there to receive them.  You will see in a future chapter how Rollo went to see this museum.  Vesuvius, Herculaneum, and Pompeii are all to the eastward of Naples, following the shore of the bay. To the westward, at the distance of about a mile or two from the centre of the town, is a famous passage through a hill, like the tunnel of a railway, which is considered a great curiosity. This passage is called the Grotto of Posilipo. You will see its place marked upon the map. The wonder of this subterranean passage way is its great antiquity. It has existed at least eighteen hundred years, and how much longer nobody knows. It is wide enough for a good broad road. When it was first cut through, it was only high enough for a carriage to pass; but the floor of it has been cut down at different times, until now the tunnel is nearly seventy feet high at the ends, and about twenty-five in the middle. High up on the sides of it, at different distances, you can see the marks made by the hubs of the wheels, as they rubbed against the rocks, at the different levels of the road way, in ancient times.  On passing through the grotto in a carriage, or on foot, the traveller comes out to an open country beyond, where he sees a magnificent prospect spread out before him. The road goes on along the coast, and comes to several very curious places, which will be described particularly in future chapters of this volume.  On the afternoon of the day when Mr. George and his party arrived at the hotel, just before sundown, Rollo came into Mrs. Gray's parlor, where Mr. George and all the rest of the party, except Josie, were sitting, and asked them to go with him and see a place which he and Josie had found.  \"Where is it, and what is it?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"You must come and see,\" said Rollo. \"I would rather not tell you till you come and see.\"  But Mrs. Gray, being somewhat fatigued with her ride, and being, moreover, very comfortably seated on a sofa, seemed not inclined to move.  \"Rosie may go instead,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"and when she has seen it, she may come back and tell me, and if she thinks it is worth while I will go.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo; \"come, Rosie.\"  So Rollo led the way, and Rosie followed out of the parlor into the hall, and from the hall along a sort of corridor which led to a narrow and winding stone stair.  \"No,\" said Rosie, as soon as she began to ascend the stair, \"I don't think mother will like to come. She does not like to go up long stairs, especially stone stairs, and more especially still, stairs that wind round and round.\"  \"Wait and see,\" said Rollo.  After going round and round several times,--all the while ascending,--Rollo came out to a sort of open passage way, paved with glazed tiles of a very pretty pattern, where there was a door leading out to a balcony. From this balcony there was a narrow iron stair which led up on the outside of the house to the roof. Rollo led the way up this stair, and Rosie followed him, though somewhat timidly. They landed at length on a sort of platform among the chimneys, from which another stair led up to another platform, higher still, where Josie was.  \"There!\" said Rollo, as soon as he reached the first platform, \"don't you think your mother would like to be here?\"  Rosie looked around, and saw that a magnificent panorama presented itself to her view.  \"She would like to _be_ here very much, if she only dared to come,\" said Rosie.  On looking towards the east, Rosie could survey the whole shore of the bay in that direction, with the continuous line of towns and villages along the margin of the water, and the immense green slopes of Vesuvius rising beyond. Among the green fields and groves, far up these slopes, white hamlets and villas were scattered, and above, the double summit of Vesuvius was seen, with dense volumes of white smoke ascending from one of the peaks. The children, too, could look from where they stood far out over the bay, and see the ships and steamers in the offing, and great numbers of small boats plying to and fro nearer the shore.  Rollo had an opera glass in his hand, which he used as a spy-glass. He let Rosie look through this glass at the mountain, so that she might see the smoke coming out more distinctly. With the glass, besides the general column of vapor, she could discern several places, near the summit, where small, separate puffs of smoke were issuing.  Farther down the mountain, Rollo directed her attention to a white building, which was seen very distinctly in the rays of the setting sun. This building, he said, must be the Hermitage.  \"How do you know it is the Hermitage?\" asked Rosie.  [Illustration: VIEW THROUGH THE GLASS.]  \"I know by the situation of it,\" said Rollo. \"Look through the glass and you will see that it is the highest house on the mountain side. Besides, it stands on the end of a ridge or spur, projecting from the mountain, just as I know the Hermitage does, with a deep valley on each side of it.\"  \"I should have thought that they would have built it in one of the valleys,\" said Rosie. \"It would have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24488"],["title","Rollo in Naples (#8)"],["body","sheltered then from the wind.\"  \"No,\" said Rollo. \"That would not have been a good plan at all, for then it would have been in the track of the streams of lava. The lava comes down through the valleys.\"  \"I can see the zigzag road leading up to the Hermitage,\" said Rosie.  \"Yes,\" replied Rollo; \"and I think it probable we could see people going up or coming down, if there were any there now.\"  \"I mean to watch,\" said Rosie.  Rosie watched, but she did not see any thing moving. The truth was, that the people who had been up that day had all come down. They usually come down early in the afternoon. And yet parties sometimes make arrangements to stay up there until after dark, so as to see the glow of the fires that are continually smouldering in the chasms and crevices of the crater, and sometimes breaking out there.  Mrs. Gray was so much pleased with Rosie's report of what she saw on the roof, that she went up herself immediately after Rosie came down. Mr. George went up too. As for Josie, he staid up there all the time.  When Mrs. Gray and Mr. George reached the first platform, Josie called to them. \"Mother,\" said he, \"come up here!\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"this is high enough for me. I can see very well here.\"  Mrs. Gray was very much interested in the view of the mountain, and of the column of smoke issuing from the summit. She had not seen the summit before, as all the upper part of the mountain had been enveloped in clouds during the time while they were approaching the town.  She was also much pleased with the view of Naples itself, which she obtained from this platform. The hotel was built out over the water, so that from the lookout the town was spread out in full view, with all the great castles and towers which crowned the cliffs and headlands above, and the various moles, and piers, and fortresses, that extended out into the water below.  In coming up the iron stair, on the outside of the building, Mrs. Gray had been a little afraid; but in coming down she found the steps so firm and solid under her tread that she said she should not be afraid at all a second time.  \"Then, mother,\" said Rosie, \"let us come up here this evening after dark, and then on the top of the mountain, instead of smoke coming out, we shall see fire.\"  \"Shall we, Rollo?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"I believe so,\" said Rollo. \"At any rate they do sometimes see fire coming out; and I don't know why we should not to-night.\"  It was finally agreed that after it became dark, Rollo and Josie should go up alone first, to see if there was any fire, and if there was, then Mrs. Gray and Rosie were to go up.  Accordingly, about eight o'clock, Rollo and Josie went up. They very soon came running down again, and reported that there was quite a bright fire. So Mrs. Gray and Rosie went up. Taking their stations on the platform, and looking towards the mountain, they could see distinctly a bright glow playing over the summit, with brighter flashes beaming up from time to time. The sight impressed them all with an emotion of solemn awe.     CHAPTER V.  PLANNING THE ASCENSION.   Rollo was very impatient for the time to come for the ascent of Vesuvius; but several days elapsed before Mr. George was ready. Then, after that, for two or three days, the weather was not favorable. The sky was filled with showery-looking clouds, and great caps of fog hung over the summits of the mountains.  \"If we get up there when there are mists and fogs hanging about the mountain,\" said Mr. George, \"we shall not be able to see the fire at all.\"  \"Then I would rather wait for a fair day,\" said Rollo.  Rollo repeatedly asked Rosie if she was not going up.  \"I don't know,\" said Rosie; \"it depends upon my mother. I shall not go unless she goes, and she says she has not decided.\"  At last, after several days of uncertain weather, the wind came round to the westward, the clouds passed off, and the whole sky became serene. This was in the afternoon. Mr. George had been rambling with Rollo about the town that day; but when he found that the weather promised now to be good, he said he would go home and talk with Mrs. Gray about making the ascent. So he and Rollo returned to the hotel, and went up together to Mrs. Gray's room.  Mr. George told Mrs. Gray that the weather promised to be favorable the next day for the ascent of the mountain.  \"And Rollo and I,\" said he, \"think of going up. If you would like to go, we should be very happy to have you join our party.\"  \"_Can_ I go, do you think?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"O, yes,\" said Mr. George; \"you certainly can go, for you can be carried up in a _portantina_ from the place where we leave the carriage. But if you please, I will send for a commissioner, and he can tell us all about it.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"I should like to have you do that.\"  \"Ring the bell, then, Rollo,\" said Mr. George.  So Rollo rang the bell; a servant man soon came in. He was what Rollo called the chamberman. His business was to make the beds and take care of the rooms. This work, in Italy, is done by men generally, instead of by women.  \"Is there a commissioner attached to this hotel,\" asked Mr. George, addressing the servant, and speaking in French, \"who accompanies parties to Vesuvius?\"  \"Yes, sir, certainly,\" said the servant.  \"What is his name?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Philippe,\" replied the man.  \"Where is he?\" asked Mr. George.  \"He is below,\" said the man.  \"Please ask him to come up,\" said Mr. George. \"I want to talk with him about an excursion to the mountain.\"  The servant man went down, and pretty soon Philippe appeared. He was a very intelligent looking young man, neatly dressed, and with a frank and agreeable countenance.  \"This is Philippe, I suppose,\" said Mr. George, speaking in French.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Philippe.  \"Take a seat,\" said Mr. George. \"This lady wishes me to make some inquiries of you about going up the mountain. Do you speak English?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Philippe, \"a little.\"  On hearing this Mr. George changed the conversation into the English language, so that Mrs. Gray might understand what was said, without the inconvenience and delay of having it interpreted.  \"In the first place,\" said Mr. George, \"when ladies ascend the Mountain, how far do they go in a carriage?\"  \"To the Hermitage,\" said Philippe.  \"Can you go in a good, comfortable carriage all the way to the Hermitage?\" asked Mr. George.  \"O, yes, sir,\" said Philippe. \"We take an excellent carriage from town. The road is very winding to go up the mountain, but it is perfectly good. A lady can go up there as comfortably as she can ride about town.\"  Philippe further said that ladies often went up with parties as far as the Hermitage, and then, if they did not wish to go any farther, they remained there until their friends came down.  \"What sort of a place is the Hermitage?\" asked Mrs. Gray. \"Is it an inn?\"  \"Yes, madam,\" said Philippe. \"It is an inn. It is a very plain and homely place, but a lady can stay there very well a few hours.\"  \"Is there a family there?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"No, madam,\" said Philippe; \"it is kept by a monk.\"  \"Let us go, mother,\" said Josie. \"We can go up _there_ as well as not.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"I think I should like to go up at least as far as there. I can take a book to read, to while away the time while you are up the mountain; or I can ramble about, I suppose. Is it a pleasant place to ramble about, around the Hermitage?\"  \"Yes, madam; it is a _very_ pleasant place,\" replied Philippe. \"You have an exceedingly fine view of the bay, and of Naples, and of the islands, and of the whole Campagna. Then the observatory is near, and that is a very pleasant place, with gardens and plantations of trees all around it. Perhaps the beggars might be a little troublesome if you walked out, but I think I could manage about that.\"  \"What _is_ the observatory that you speak of?\" asked Mr. George.  \"It is a government establishment that is kept there for making observations on the state of the mountain,\" replied Philippe. \"It is a fine building, and it has very pretty gardens and grounds around it.\"  \"I should think it would be a very pleasant place,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"Indeed, it looks like a pleasant place seen from this hotel with Rollo's opera glass.\"  \"Well, now for the next stage of the journey,\" said Mr. George; \"that is, from the Hermitage to the foot of the cone. How far is that, and how do we go?\"  \"It is about three quarters of an hour's walk,\" replied Philippe. \"There is no carriage road, but only a mule path, and in some places the road is very rough.\"  \"Is it steep?\" asked Mr. George.  \"No, sir,\" said Philippe; \"the steep part comes afterwards. The mule path is nearly on a level, but it is rough and rocky. There are three ways of going. You can walk, you can ride upon a mule or a donkey, or finally, you can be carried in a chair. Ladies that do not like to walk so far usually ride on a donkey, or else are carried. It is easier to be carried, but it costs a little more.\"  \"How much more?\" asked Mr. George.  \"A dollar,\" said Philippe.  \"I think I should rather be carried if I were to go,\" said Mrs. Gray.  \"I'd rather ride on a donkey,\" said Rosie.  \"And I on a mule,\" said Josie.  \"You and I might walk, Rollo,\" said Mr. George.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I would rather walk.\"  Rollo always preferred to go on foot when on any of these mountain excursions, because then he could ramble about this way and that, wherever he pleased, and climb up upon the rocks, and gather plants and specimens.  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George; \"and this brings us to the foot of the steep part of the mountain. How far is it up this last steep part?\"  \"About an hour's work, hard climbing,\" said Philippe.  \"Is it very hard climbing?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Philippe; \"it is right up a steep slope of rocks.\"  \"Is there good footing,\" asked Mr. George, \"or are the rocks loose, or slippery?\"  \"It is very good footing,\" said Philippe. \"In one sense the rocks are loose,"]]]
