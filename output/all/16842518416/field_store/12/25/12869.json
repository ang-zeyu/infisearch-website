We were given no opportunity to draw up plans to escape from exile, believe me.\"  Phil glanced over at Celia. \"In that case,\" he said, a little thickly, \"we'd better see if we can't draw some up together immediately.\"  Jackson asked, staring, \"What are you talking about, Phil? Don't think for a moment Silas Thayer isn't doing what he can to find out who put that trick over on him. I'm not at all sure he doesn't suspect me. And if he can tie it to us, it's our neck. If you have some crazy idea of getting off the planet now, let me tell you that for the next few years we can't risk making a single move! If we stay quiet, we're safe. We--\"  \"I don't think we'd be safe,\" Phil said.  On his right, Celia Adams added sharply, \"The gentleman in the other car who's just started to lower that window had better raise it again! If he's got good eyesight, he'll see I have a gun pointed at him. Yes, that's much better! Go on, Phil.\"  \"Have you both gone out of your minds?\" Jackson demanded.  \"No,\" Celia said. She laughed with a sudden shakiness in her tone, added, \"Though I don't know why we haven't! We've thought of the possibility that the rest of you might feel it would be better if Phil and I weren't around any more, Wayne.\"  \"That's nonsense!\" Jackson said.  \"Maybe. Anyway, don't try it. You wouldn't be doing yourselves a favor even if it worked. Better listen now.\"  \"Listen to what?\" Jackson demanded exasperatedly. \"I'm telling you it will be all right, if we just don't make any mistakes. The only real pieces of evidence were your duplicator and the original gun. Since we're rid of those--\"  \"We're not rid of the gun, Wayne,\" Phil said. \"I still have it. I haven't dared get rid of it.\"  \"You ... what do you mean?\"  \"I was with Beulah in the Fort Roye hospital when she died,\" Phil said. He added to Ronald Black, \"That was two days after the ship brought the seven of you in.\"  Black nodded, his eyes alert. \"Major Jackson informed me.\"  \"She was very weak, of course, but quite lucid,\" Phil went on. \"She talked a good deal--reminiscing, and in a rather happy vein. She finally mentioned the Geest gun, and how Uncle William used to keep us boys ... Wayne and me ... spell-bound with stories about the Gunderland Battle, and how he'd picked the gun up there.\"  Jackson began, \"And what does--\"  \"He didn't get the gun there,\" Phil said. \"Beulah said Uncle William came in from Earth with the first shipment of settlers and was never off Roye again in his life.\"  \"He ... then--\"  Phil said, \"Don't you get it? He found the gun right here on Roye. Beulah thought it was awfully funny. William was an old fool, she said, but the best liar she'd ever known. He came in with the thing one day after he'd been traipsing around the back country, and said it looked 'sort of' like pictures of Geest guns he'd seen, and that he was going to put the inscription on it and have some fun now and then.\" Phil took a deep breath. \"Uncle William found it lying in a pile of ashes where someone had made camp a few days before. He figured it would have been a planetary speedster some rich sportsmen from Earth had brought in for a taste of outworld hunting on Roye, and that one of them had dumped the broken oddball gun into the fire to get rid of it.  \"That was thirty-six years ago. Beulah remembered it happened a year before I was born.\"  There was silence for some seconds. Then Ronald Black said evenly, \"And what do you conclude, Boles?\"  Phil looked at him. \"I'd conclude that Norm Vaughn was right about there having been some fairly intelligent creatures here once. The Geests ran into them and exterminated them as they usually do. That might have been a couple of centuries back. Then, thirty-six years ago, one of their scouts slipped in here without being spotted, found human beings on the planet, looked around a little and left again.\"  He took the Geest gun from his pocket, hefted it in his hand. \"We have the evidence here,\" he said. \"We had it all the time and didn't know it.\"  Ronald Black said dryly, \"We may have the evidence. But we have no slightest proof at all now that that's what it is.\"  \"I know it,\" Phil said. \"Now Beulah's gone ... well, we couldn't even prove that William Boles never left the planet, for that matter. There weren't any records to speak of being kept in the early days.\" He was silent a moment. \"Supposing,\" he said, \"we went ahead anyway. We hand the gun in, with the story I just told you--\"  Jackson made a harsh, laughing sound. \"That would hang us fast, Phil!\"  \"And nothing else?\"  \"Nothing else,\" Black said with finality. \"Why should anyone believe the story now? There are a hundred more likely ways in which a Geest gun could have got to Roye. The gun is tangible evidence of the hoax, but that's all.\"  Phil asked, \"Does anybody ... including the cautious gentlemen in the car over there ... disagree with that?\"  There was silence again. Phil shrugged, turned towards the cliff edge, drew his arm back and hurled the Geest gun far up and out above the sea. Still without speaking, the others turned their heads to watch it fall towards the water, then looked back at him.  \"I didn't think very much of that possibility myself,\" Phil said unsteadily. \"But one of you might have. All right--_we_ know the Geests know we're here. But we won't be able to convince anyone else of it. And, these last few years, the war seems to have been slowing down again. In the past, that's always meant the Geests were preparing a big new surprise operation.  \"So the other thing now--the business of getting off Roye. It can't be done unless some of you have made prior arrangements for it Earthside. If it had been possible in any other way, I'd have been out of this place ten years ago.\"  Ronald Black said carefully, \"Very unfortunately, Boles, no such arrangements have been made.\"  \"Then there it is,\" Phil said. \"I suppose you see now why I thought this group should get together. The ten masterminds! Well, we've hoaxed ourselves into a massive jam. Now let's find out if there's any possible way--_any possibility at all!_--of getting out of it again.\"  A voice spoke tinnily from Jackson's lapel communicator. \"Major Jackson?\"  \"Yes?\" Jackson said.  \"Please persuade Miss Adams that it is no longer necessary to point her gun at this car. In view of the stated emergency, we feel we had better come out now--and join the conference.\"         *       *       *  FROM THE RECORDS OF THE TERRITORIAL OFFICE, 2345 A.D.  ... It is generally acknowledged that the Campaign of the 132nd Segment marked the turning point of the Geest War. Following the retransfer of Colonel Silas Thayer to Earth, the inspired leadership of Major Wayne Jackson and his indefatigable and exceptionally able assistants, notably CLU President Boles, transformed the technically unfortified and thinly settled key world of Roye within twelve years into a virtual death trap for any invading force. Almost half of the Geest fleet which eventually arrived there was destroyed in the first week subsequent to the landing, and few of the remaining ships were sufficiently undamaged to be able to lift again. The enemy relief fleet, comprising an estimated forty per cent of the surviving Geest space power, was intercepted in the 134th Segment by the combined Earth forces under Admiral McKenna's command and virtually annihilated.  In the following two years ...   [Illustration]     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Analog_ August 1962.

The kitten's tone was airy,    The butterfly would scoff;  When there came along a fairy    Who whisked his wings right off.   And then--for it is written    Fairies can do such things--  Upon the startled kitten    She stuck the yellow wings.   [Illustration]   The kitten felt a quiver,    She rose into the air,  Then flew down to the river    To view her image there.   With fear her heart was smitten,    And she began to cry,  \"Am I a butter-kitten?    Or just a kitten-fly?\"      Two Old Kings    [Illustration]   Oh! the King of Kanoodledum  And the King of Kanoodledee,    They went to sea    In a jigamaree--  A full-rigged jigamaree.   And one king couldn't steer,  And the other, no more could he;    So they both upset    And they both got wet,  As wet as wet could be.   [Illustration]   And one king couldn't swim  And the other, he couldn't, too;    So they had to float,    While their empty boat  Danced away o'er the sea so blue.   Then the King of Kanoodledum  He turned a trifle pale,    And so did he    Of Kanoodledee,  But they saw a passing sail!   And one king screamed like fun  And the other king screeched like mad,    And a boat was lowered    And took them aboard;  And, my! but those kings were glad!   [Illustration]      [Illustration]   A Day Dream    Polly's patchwork--oh, dear me!--  Truly is a sight to see.  Rumpled, crumpled, soiled, and frayed--  Will the quilt be ever made?  See the stitches yawning wide--  Can it be that Polly _tried_?   Some are right and some are wrong,  Some too short and some too long,  Some too loose and some too tight;  Grimy smudges on the white,  And a tiny spot of red,  Where poor Polly's finger bled.  Strange such pretty, dainty blocks--  Bits of Polly's summer frocks--  Should have proved so hard to sew,  And the cause of so much woe!   One day it was _very_ hot,  And the thread got in a knot,  Drew the seam up in a heap--  Polly calmly fell asleep.  Then she had a lovely dream;  Straight and even was the seam,  Pure and spotless was the white;  All the blocks were finished quite--  Each joined to another one.  Lo, behold! the quilt was done,--  Lined and quilted,--and it seemed  To cover Polly as she dreamed!      Our Club    We're going to have the mostest fun!    It's going to be a club;  And no one can belong to it    But Dot and me and Bub.   [Illustration]   We thought we'd have a Reading Club,    But couldn't 'cause, you see,  Not one of us knows how to read--    Not Dot nor Bub nor me.   And then we said a Sewing Club,    But thought we'd better not;  'Cause none of us knows how to sew--    Not me nor Bub nor Dot.   And so it's just a Playing Club,    We play till time for tea;  And, oh, we have the bestest times!    Just Dot and Bub and me.      Puzzled    There lived in ancient Scribbletown a wise old writer-man,  Whose name was Homer Cicero Demosthenes McCann.  He'd written treatises and themes till, \"For a change,\" he said,  \"I think I'll write a children's book before I go to bed.\"   [Illustration]   He pulled down all his musty tomes in Latin and in Greek;  Consulted cyclopædias and manuscripts antique,  Essays in Anthropology, studies in counterpoise--  \"For these,\" he said, \"are useful lore for little girls and boys.\"   He scribbled hard, and scribbled fast, he burned the midnight oil,  And when he reached \"The End\" he felt rewarded for his toil;  He said, \"This charming Children's Book is greatly to my credit.\"  And now he's sorely puzzled that no child has ever read it.      [Illustration]   An Intercepted Valentine    Little Bo-Peep, will you be mine?  I want you for my Valentine.  You are my choice of all the girls,  With your blushing cheeks and your fluttering curls,  With your ribbons gay and your kirtle neat,  None other is so fair and sweet.  Little Bo-Peep, let's run away,  And marry each other on Midsummer Day;  And ever to you I'll be fond and true,              Your faithful Valentine,                     LITTLE BOY BLUE.      A Long-Felt Want   [Illustration]   One day wee Willie and his dog    Sprawled on the nursery floor.  He had a florist's catalogue,    And turned the pages o'er,   Till all at once he gave a spring,    \"Hurrah!\" he cried with joy;  \"Mamma, here's just the very thing    To give your little boy!   \"For when we fellows go to school,    We lose our things, you know;  And in that little vestibule    They do get mixed up so.   \"And as you often say you can't    Take care of 'em for me,  Why don't you buy a _rubber plant_,    And an _umbrella tree_?\"      The Musical Carp    There once was a corpulent carp  Who wanted to play on a harp,      But to his chagrin      So short was his fin  That he couldn't reach up to C sharp.   [Illustration]      The Intelligent Hen    [Illustration]   'Twas long ago,--a year or so,--    In a barnyard by the sea,  That an old hen lived whom you may know    By the name of Fiddle-de-dee.  She scratched around in the sand all day,    For a lively old hen was she.   And then do you know, it happened this way    In that barnyard by the sea;  A great wise owl came down one day,    And hooted at Fiddle-de-dee,    Just hooted at Fiddle-de-dee.  And he cried, \"Hi! Hi! old hen, I say!    You're provincial, it seems to me!\"   \"Why, what do you mean?\" cried the old red hen,    As mad as hops was she.  \"Oh, I've been 'round among great men,    In the world where the great men be.  And none of them scratch with their claws like you,    They write with a quill like me.\"   Now very few people could get ahead    Of that old hen, Fiddle-de-dee.  She went and hunted the posy-bed,    And returned in triumphant glee.  And ever since then, that little red hen,  She writes with a jonquil pen, quil pen,    She writes with a jonquil pen.   [Illustration]      [Illustration]   The Happy Hyena    There once was a happy Hyena  Who played on an old concertina.      He dressed very well,      And in his lapel  He carelessly stuck a verbena.      [Illustration]   A Great Lady    This is the Queen of Nonsense Land,  She wears her bonnet on her hand;  She carpets her ceilings and frescos her floors,  She eats on her windows and sleeps on her doors.  Oh, ho! Oh, ho! to think there could be  A lady so silly-down-dilly as she!   She goes for a walk on an ocean wave,  She fishes for cats in a coral cave;  She drinks from an empty glass of milk,  And lines her potato trees with silk.  I'm sure that fornever and never was seen  So foolish a thing as the Nonsense Queen!   She ordered a wig for a blue bottle fly,  And she wrote a note to a pumpkin pie;  She makes all the oysters wear emerald rings,  And does dozens of other nonsensible things.  Oh! "]]]
