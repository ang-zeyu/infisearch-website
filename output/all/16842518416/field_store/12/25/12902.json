It was one of a suite of rooms occupied by Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones, widely known for her wealth and beauty, and this girl--a little thing of eleven--was the only child of Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones, and was named Alora.  It was not cold that made her shiver, for across the handsomely furnished room an open window gratefully admitted the summer sunshine and the summer breeze. Near the window, where the draught came coolest, a middle-aged woman in a sober dress sat reading. Alora did not look at this person but kept her gaze fixed anxiously upon the doorway that led to the corridor, and the spasmodic shudders that at times shook her little body seemed due to nervous fear.  The room was so still that every tick of the Dresden clock could be distinctly heard. When Miss Gorham, Alora's governess, turned a page of her book, the rustle was appallingly audible. And the clock ticked on, and Miss Gorham turned page after page, and still the child sat bowed upon her chair and eagerly eyed the passageway.  It seemed ages before the outer door of the suite finally opened and a man moved softly down the passage and paused at the entrance of the reception room. The man was white-haired, dignified and distinguished in appearance. Hat in hand, he stood as if undecided while Alora bounded from her seat and came to him, her eyes, big and pleading, reading his face with dramatic intentness.  \"Well, well, my dear; what is it?\" he said in a kindly voice.  \"May I see my mamma now, Doctor?\" she asked.  He shook his head, turning to the table to place his hat and gloves upon it.  \"Not just yet, little one,\" he gently replied, and noting her quick-drawn breath of disappointment he added: \"Why, I haven't seen her myself, this morning.\"  \"Why do you keep me from her, Doctor Anstruther? Don't you know it's-- it's wicked, and cruel?\"--a sob in her voice.  The old physician looked down upon the child pityingly.  \"Mamma is ill--very ill, you know--and to disturb her might--it might-- well, it might make her worse,\" he explained lamely.  \"I won't disturb her. There's a nurse in there, all the time. Why should I disturb my mamma more than a nurse?\" asked Alora pleadingly.  He evaded the question. The big eyes disconcerted him.  \"When I have seen your mother,\" said he, \"I may let you go to her for a few minutes. But you must be very quiet, so as not to excite her. We must avoid anything of an exciting nature. You understand that, don't you, Lory?\"  She studied his face gravely. When he held out a hand to her she clung to it desperately and a shudder again shook her from head to foot.  \"Tell me, Doctor Anstruther,\" in low, passionate tones, \"is my mother dying?\"  He gave an involuntary start.  \"Who put that notion into your head, Lory?\"  \"Miss Gorham.\"  He frowned and glanced reprovingly at the governess, who had lowered her book to her lap and was regarding the scene with stolid unconcern.  \"You mustn't mind such idle gossip, my dear. I am the doctor, you know, and I am doing all that can be done to save your mother's life. Don't worry until I tell you to, Lory; and now let me go to see my patient.\"  He withdrew his hand from her clasp and turned into the passage again. The girl listened to his footsteps as he approached her mother's bedchamber, paused a moment, and then softly opened the door and entered. Silence again pervaded the reception room. The clock resumed its loud ticking. Miss Gorham raised her book. Alora went back to her chair, trembling.  The front bedchamber was bright and cheery, a big room fitted with every modern luxury. The doctor blinked his eyes as he entered from the dim passage, for here was sunlight and fresh air in plenty. Beside the bed stood a huge vase of roses, their delicate fragrance scenting the atmosphere. Upon the bed, beneath a costly lace coverlid, lay a woman thirty-five years of age, her beautiful face still fresh and unlined, the deep blue eyes turned calmly upon the physician.  \"Welcome, Doctor Anstruther,\" she said. \"Do you realize you have kept me waiting?\"  \"I am sorry, Mrs. Jones,\" he replied, approaching her. \"There are so many demands upon my time that----\"  \"I know,\" a little impatiently; \"but now that you are here please tell me how I am this morning.\"  \"How do you feel?\"  \"I do not suffer, but it takes more morphine to quiet the pain. Janet has used the hypodermic four times since midnight,\" with a glance at the gray-robed nurse who stood silently by the table.  The doctor nodded, thoughtfully looking down her. There was small evidence of illness in her appearance, but he knew that her hours were numbered and that the dread disease that had fastened upon her was creeping on with ever increasing activity. She knew it, too, and smiled a grim little smile as she added: \"How long can I last, at this rate?\"  \"Do not anticipate, my dear,\" he answered gravely. \"Let us do all that may be done, and----\"  \"I must know!\" she retorted. \"I have certain important arrangements to make that must not be needlessly delayed.\"  \"I can understand that, Mrs. Jones.\"  \"Then tell me frankly, how long have I to live?\"  \"Perhaps a month; possibly less; but----\"  \"You are not honest with me, Doctor Anstruther! What I wish to know-- what I _must_ know--is how soon this disease will be able to kill me. If we manage to defer the end somewhat, all the better; but the fiend must not take me unaware, before I am ready to resign my life.\"  He seated himself beside the bed and reflected. This was his most interesting patient; he had attended her constantly for more than a year and in this time had learned to admire not only her beauty of person but her \"gameness\" and wholesome mentality. He knew something of her past life and history, too, as well from her own lips as from common gossip, for this was no ordinary woman and her achievements were familiar to many.  She was the daughter of Captain Bob Seaver, whose remarkable career was known to every man in the West. Captain Bob was one \"forty-niners\" and had made fortunes and lost them with marvelous regularity. He had a faculty for finding gold, but his speculations were invariably unwise, so his constant transitions from affluence to poverty, and vice versa, were the subject of many amusing tales, many no doubt grossly exaggerated. And the last venture of Captain Bob Seaver, before he died, was to buy the discredited \"Ten-Spot\" mine and start to develop it.  At that time he was a widower with one motherless child--Antoinette--a girl of eighteen who had been reared partly in mining camps and partly at exclusive girls' schools in the East, according to her father's varying fortunes. \"Tony\" Seaver, as she was generally called in those days, combined culture and refinement with a thorough knowledge of mining, and when her father passed away and left her absolute mistress of the tantalizing \"Ten-Spot,\" she set to work to make the mine a success, directing her men in person and displaying such shrewd judgment and intelligence, coupled with kindly consideration for her assistants, that she became the idol of the miners, all of whom were proud to be known as employees of Tony Seaver's \"Ten-Spot\" would have died for their beautiful employer if need be.  And the \"Ten-Spot\" made good. In five years Tony had garnered a million or two of well-earned dollars, and then she sold out and retired from business. Also, to the chagrin of an army of suitors, she married an artist named Jason Jones, whose talent, it was said, was not so great as his luck. So far, his fame rested on his being \"Tony Seaver's husband.\" But Tony's hobby was art, and she had recognized real worth, she claimed, in Jason Jones' creations. On her honeymoon she carried her artist husband to Europe and with him studied the works of the masters in all the art centers of the Continent. Then, enthusiastic and eager for Jason's advancement, she returned with him to New York and set him up in a splendid studio where he had every convenience and incentive to work.  So much the world at large knew. It also knew that within three years Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones separated from her husband and, with her baby girl, returned West to live. The elaborate Jones studio was abandoned and broken up and the \"promising young artist\" disappeared from the public eye. Mrs. Jones, a thorough business woman,"]]]
