I should like your advice in my      Fluctuations.\"  The Judge called on Mrs. Martha, probably after learning with precision her circumstances. \"I showed my willingness to renew my old acquaintance. She expressed her inability to be serviceable.\" Even after the Denison and Winthrop fluctuations he was not abashed by refusal, and he must have been (to quote Mrs. Peachum's words) \"a bitter bad judge 'o women,\" for he called again and again.       \"She seemed resolved not to move out of the house; made some      Difficulties to accept an Election Sermon lest it should be an      obligation to her. The coach staying long, I made some excuse for      my stay. She said she would be glad to wait on me till midnight      provided I should solicit her no more to that effect.\"  This decision he accepted.  Poor old wife-seeking Judge, with your hanging sleeves, your broken and drooping wings, feebly did you still flutter around for a resting-place to \"lay your Weary Head in modesty.\" You fluctuated to a new widow, Madam Harris, and she gave you \"a nutmeg as it grew,\" ever a true lover's gift in Shakespeare's day. On January 11th, 1722, this letter was sent to \"Mrs. Mary Gibbs, widow, at Newton.\"       \"Madam, your removal out of town and the Severity of the Weather      are the Reason of my making you this Epistolary Visit. In times      past (as I remember) you were minded that I should marry you by      giving you to your desirable Bridegroom. Some sense of this      intended Respect abides with me still and puts me upon enquiring      whether you be willing I should marry you now by becoming your      Husband. Aged feeble and exhausted as I am your favourable Answer      to this Enquiry in a few lines, the Candour of it will much oblige,      Madam, your humble serv't Samuel Sewall.\"  This not-too-alluring love-letter brought a favorable answer, for the Judge assured her she \"writ incomparably well,\" and he accompanied this praise with a suitable and useful gift, \"A Quire of Paper, a good Leathern Ink Horn, a stick of Sealing Wax and 200 Wafers in a little Box.\"  He was even sharper in bargaining with Widow Gibbs than he had been with other matrimonial candidates. She had no property to leave him by will, but he astutely stipulated that her children sign a contract that, should she die before him, they would pay him £100. She thought him \"hard,\" and so did her sons and her son-in-law, and so he was--hard even for those times of hard bargains and hard marriage contracts in hard New England. He would agree to give her but £50 a year in case of his death. The value of wives had depreciated in his eyes since the £250 a year Widow Denison. His gifts too were not as rich as those bestowed on that yearned-for widow. He had seen too many tokens go for naught. Glazed almonds, Meers cakes, an orange, were good enough for so cheap a sweetheart. He remained very stiff and peremptory about the marriage contract, the £100, and wrote her one very unpleasant letter about it; and he feared lest she being so attached to her children might not be tender to him \"when there soon would be an end of the old man.\" At last she yielded to his sharp bargain and they were married. He lived eight years, so I doubt not Mary was tender to him and mourned him when he died, hard though he was and wigless withal.  We gather from the pages of Judge Sewall's diary many hints about the method of conducting other courtships. We discover the Judge craftily and slyly inquiring whether his daughter Mary's lover-apparent had previously courted another Boston maid; we see him conferring with lover Gerrish's father; and after a letter from the latter we see the lover \"at Super and drank to Mary in the third place.\" He called again when it was too cold to sit downstairs, and was told he would be \"wellcomm to come Friday night.\" We read on Saturday:       \"In the evening Sam Gerrish comes not; we expected him; Mary      dress'd herself; it was a painfull disgracefull disapointment.\"  A month later the recreant lover reappeared and finally married poor disappointed Mary, who died very complaisantly in a short time and left him free to marry his first love, which he quickly did. We find the Judge after his daughter's death higgling over her marriage portion with Mr. Gerrish, Sr., and see that grief for her did not prevent him from showing as much shrewdness in that matter as he had displayed in his own courtships.  Timid Betty Sewall was as much harassed in love as in religion. We find her father, when she was but seventeen years old, making frequent investigation about the estate of one Captain Tuthill, a prospective suitor who had visited Betty and \"wished to speak with her.\" The Judge had his hesitating daughter read aloud to him of the mating of Adam and Eve, as a soothing and alluring preparation for the thought of matrimony, with, however, this most unexpected result:       \"At night Capt. Tuthill comes to speak with Betty, who hid herself      all alone in the coach for several hours till he was gone, so that      we sought her at several houses, till at last came in of herself      and look'd very wild.\"  This action of pure maidenly terror elicited sympathy even in the Judge's match-making heart, and he told the lover he was willing to know his daughter's mind better. This was on January 10th, 1698. Ten days later we find wild-eyed Betty going out of her way to avoid drinking wine with one Captain Turner, much to her father's annoyance. By September she had refused another suitor.  Her father wrote thus:       \"Got home [from Rhode Island] by seven, in good health, though the      day was hot, find my family in health, only disturbed at Betty's      denying Mr. Hirst, and my wife hath a cold. The Lord sanctify      Mercyes and Afflictions.\"  And again, a month later:       \"Mr. Wm. Hirst comes and thanks my wife and me for our kindness to      his Son, in giving him the liberty of our house. Seems to do it in      the way of taking leave. I thank'd him, and for his countenance to      Hannah at the Wedding. Told him that the well wisher's of my      daughter and his son had persuaded him to go to Brantry and visit      her there, &c.; and said if there were hopes would readily do it.      But as things were twould make persons think he was so involved      that he was not fit to go any wether else. He has I suppose taken      his final leave. I gave him Mr. Oakes Sermon, and my Father Hulls      Funeral Sermon.\"  Two days later, Judge Sewall writes to Betty, who has gone to \"Brantry\" on a visit.                                                BOSTON, October 26, 1699.       \"ELIZABETH: Mr. Hirst waits on you once more to see if you can bid      him welcome. It ought to be seriously considered, that your drawing      back from him after all that has passed between you, will be to      your Prejudice; and will tend to discourage persons of worth from      making their Court to you. And you had need well consider whether      you will be able to bear his final leaving of you, howsoever it may      seem grateful to you at present. When persons come toward us we are      apt to look upon their undesirable Circumstances mostly: and      thereupon to shun them. But when persons retire from us for good      and all, we are in danger of looking only on that which is      desirable in them, to our wofull disquiet. Whereas 'tis the      property of a good Ballance to turn where the most weight is,      though there be some also in the other Scale. I do not see but the      match is well liked by judicious persons, and such as are your      Cordial friends, and mine also.       \"Yet notwithstanding, if you find in yourself an unmovable,      incurable Aversion from him and cannot love and honor and obey him,      I shall say no more, nor give you any further trouble in this      matter. It had better off than on. So praying God to pardon us and      pitty our Undeserving, and to direct and strengthen and settle you      in making a right judgment, and giving a right Answer, I take      leave, who am, Dear Child, Your loving father.       \"Your mother remembers to you.\"  Even this very proper and fatherly advice did not have an immediate effect upon the shy and vacillating young girl, for not until a year later did she become the wife of persistent Grove Hirst.  One of the most typical stories of colonial methods of \"matching\" among fine gentlefolk is found in the worry of Emanuel Downing, a man of dignity in the commonwealth, and of his wife, Lucy (who was Gov. Winthrop's sister), in regard to the settlement of their children. Downing begins with anxious overtures to Endicott in regard to \"matching his sonne\" to an orphan maid living in Endicott's family, a maid who it is needless to state had a very pretty fortune. Downing states that he has been blamed for not marrying off his children earlier, \"that none are disposed of,\" and deplores his ill-luck in having them so long on his hands, and he recounts pathetically his own and his son's good points. He also got Governor Winthrop to write to Endicott pleading the match. Endicott answered both letters in a most dignified manner, stating his objections to furthering Downing's wishes, giving a succession of reasons, such as the maid's unwillingness to marry, being but fifteen years of age, his own awkward position in seeming to crowd marriage upon her when she was so rich, etc., etc. The Downings had hoped to have thriftily two marriages in the family in one day, but the daughter Luce's affairs also halted. She had been enamoured of a Mr. Eyer, an unsuitable match. He had put out to sea, to the Downings' delight, but had returned at an unlucky time when she was on with a fresh suitor. Her mother was much distressed because, though Luce declared she much liked Mr. Norton, she still showed to all around her that \"she hath not yet forgotten Mr. Eyer his fresh Red.\"  But Mistress Luce, by a telling statement "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24165"],["title","The Development of Embroidery in America (#0)"],["body","DEVELOPMENT   OF EMBROIDERY IN   AMERICA    By Candace Wheeler    [Illustration: CANDACE WHEELER    From the painting by her daughter Dora Wheeler Keith.    _Painted by Dora Wheeler Keith_]       THE DEVELOPMENT OF   EMBROIDERY IN AMERICA    _By_    CANDACE WHEELER    _Illustrated_    [Illustration]    HARPER & BROTHERS PUBLISHERS   NEW YORK AND LONDON   MCMXXI       DEVELOPMENT OF EMBROIDERY IN AMERICA    Copyright, 1921, by Harper & Brothers   Printed in the United States of America   X-V       CONTENTS     CHAP.
