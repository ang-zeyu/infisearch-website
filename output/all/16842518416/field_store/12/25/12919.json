Even, without expecting it, he told me that his library was at my      service; that he did not wish me to join any class, but to read by      myself, that he might pay every attention, and give me every      assistance in his power. Indeed he answered my highest expectation.      I am stopping with Mr. John Aikman. He is one of the most      respectable men in this vicinity. I shall be altogether retired. At      the Court of Assize, the Chief-Justice and the Attorney-General      will stop here, which will make a very agreeable change for a few      days. To pursue my studies with indefatigable industry, and ardent      zeal, will be my set purpose, so that I may never have to mourn the      loss of my precious time.       _Aug. 16th._--This day I commenced my studies by reading Latin and      Greek with Mr. Law. I began the duties of the day in imploring the      assistance of God; for without Him I cannot do anything. God has      been pleased to open my understanding, to enlighten my mind, and to      show me the necessity and blessedness of an unreserved and habitual      devotion to his heavenly will. I have heard Bishop Hedding preach,      also Rev. Nathan Bangs. I am resolved to improve my time more      diligently, and to give myself wholly to God. Oh, may his      long-suffering mercy bear with me, his wisdom guide, his power      support and defend me, and may his mercy bring me off triumphant in      the dying day!       _Aug. 17th._--I have been reading Virgil's Georgics. I find them      very difficult, and have only read seventy lines. In my spiritual      concerns I have been greatly blessed; and felt more anxiously      concerned for my soul's salvation, have prayed more than usual, and      experienced a firmer confidence in the blessed promises of the      Gospel. I have enjoyed sweet intercourse with my Saviour, my soul      resting on his divine word, with a prayerful acquiescence in his      dispensations. But alas! what evil have I done, how much time have      I lost, how many idle words have I spoken; how should these      considerations lead me to watch my thoughts, to husband my time      with judgment, and govern my tongue as with a bridle! Oh, Lord      bless me and prosper me in all my ways and labours, and keep me to      thyself!       _Aug. 18th._--The Lord has abundantly blessed me this day both in      my spiritual and classical pursuits. I have been able to pursue my      studies with facility, and have felt his Holy Spirit graciously      enlightening my mind, showing me the necessity of separating myself      from the world, and being given up entirely to his service.       _Aug. 19th._--I have this day proved that, with every temptation,      the Lord makes a way for my escape. I have enjoyed much peace. Oh,      Lord, help me to improve my precious time, so as to overcome the      assaults and escape the snares of the adversary!       _Aug. 20th._--In all the vicissitudes of life, how clearly is the      mysterious providence and superintending care of Jehovah      manifested! how strikingly can I observe the divine interposition      of my heavenly Father, and how sensibly do I realize his      benevolence, kindness, and mercy in the whole moral and blessed      economy of his equitable and infinitely wise government! On no      object do I cast my eyes without observing an affecting instance of      a benevolent and overruling power; and, while in mental      contemplations my mind is absorbed, my admiration rises still      higher to the exalted purposes and designs of Almighty God. I      behold in the soul noble faculties, superior powers of imagination,      and capacious desires, unfilled by anything terrestrial, and wishes      unsatisfied by the widest grasp of human ambition. What is this but      immortality? Oh, that my soul may feed on food immortal!       Another week is gone, eternally gone! What account can I give to my      Almighty Judge for my conduct and opportunities? Has my improvement      kept pace with the panting steeds of unretarded time? Must I give      an account of every idle word, thought, and deed? Oh, merciful God!      if the most righteous, devoted, and holy scarcely are saved, where      stall I appear? How do my vain thoughts, and unprofitable      conversation, swell heaven's register? Where is my watchfulness!      Where are my humility, purity, and hatred of sin? Where is my zeal?      Alas! alas! they are things unpractised, unfelt, almost unknown to      me. How little do I share in the toils, the labours, or the sorrows      of the righteous, and consequently how little do I participate in      their confidence, their joys, their heavenly prospects? Oh, may      these awful considerations drive me closer to God, and incite to a      more diligent improvement of my precious time, so that I may bear      the mark of a real follower of Christ!       _Aug. 22nd.--Sabbath._--When I arose this morning I endeavoured to      dedicate myself afresh to God in prayer, with a full determination      to improve the day to his glory, and to spend it in his service.      Accordingly, I spent the morning in prayer, reading, and      meditation; but when I came to mingle with the worldly-minded, my      devotions and meditations were dampened and distracted, my thoughts      unprofitable and vain. I attended a Methodist Class-meeting where I      felt myself forcibly convinced of my shortcomings. Sure I am that      unless I am more vigilant, zealous, and watchful, I shall never      reach the Paradise of God. I must be willing to bear reproach for      Christ's sake, confess him before men, or I never can be owned by      him in the presence of his Father, and the holy angels.       Merciful God! forbid that I should barter away my heavenly      inheritance for a transient gleam of momentary joy, and the empty      round of worldly pleasure:         \"Help me to watch and pray,          And on thyself rely,        Assured if I my trust betray,          I shall forever die.\"       _Aug. 23rd._--I have been abundantly prospered in my studies      to-day; and have been enabled to maintain an outward conformity in      my conduct. But alas! how blind to my own interest, to deprive      myself of the highest blessings and exalted honours the Almighty      has to bestow. Oh, Lord! help me henceforth to be wise unto      salvation. May I be sober and watch unto prayer! Amen.       _Aug. 24th._--Through the mercy of God I have been enabled in a      good degree to overcome my besetments, and have this day maintained      more consistency in conversation and conduct. Still I feel too much      deterred by the fear of man, and thirst too ardently for the      honours of the world. Merciful God! give me more grace, wisdom, and      strength, that I may triumphantly overcome and escape to heaven at      last!       I shall finish the first book of the Georgics to-day, which is the      seventh day since I commenced them. I expect to finish them in four      weeks from this time. My mind improves, and I feel much encouraged.      My labour is uniform and constant, from the dawn of day till near      eleven at night. I have not a moment to play on the flute.       _Aug. 25th._--There is nothing like implicit trust in the Almighty      for assistance, protection, and assurance! His past dispensations      and dealings with me leave not the least suspicion of his      inviolable veracity, and his efficacious promises cheer the      sadness, calm the fears of every soul that practically reposes in      and seeks after him. The truth of this, blessed be God, I have in      some measure experienced to-day. Help me, O Lord, with increasing      grace to attain still more sublime enjoyments and triumphant      prospects!       _Aug. 26th._--I feel a growing indifference to worldly pleasures,      and increasing love to God, to holiness, and heaven. Entire      confidence in a superintending Providence heals the wounded heart      of even the disconsolate widow, and gives the oil of joy for      sorrow, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.       _Aug. 27th._--This day I attended a funeral; those connected with      it were very ignorant; how strikingly this showed to me the      advantages of a good education. God forbid that I should idle away      my golden moments. Help me to choose the better part, and honour      God in all things!       _Aug. 28th._--The labours of another week are ended; during it I      have enjoyed much of the presence of God; surely the religion of      Christ dazzles all the magnificence of human glory; were I only to      regard the happiness of this life, I would embrace its doctrines,      practice its laws, and exert my influence for its extension.       _Aug. 29th.--Sabbath._--The blessings of the Lord have abundantly      surrounded me this day, and my heart has been enlarged.       _Aug. 30th._--In observing my actions and words this day, I find I      have done many things that are culpable; and yet, blessed be God,      his goodness to me is profuse. Help me to watch and pray that I      enter not into temptation.       _Aug. 31st._--How many youths around me do I see trifling away the      greatest part of their time, and profaning their Maker's name? My      soul magnifies His name that I have decided to be on the Lord's      side; how many evils have I escaped; how many blessings obtained;      what praise enjoyed, through the influence of this religion. To God      be all the glory!       _September 1st._--In no subject can we employ our thoughts more      profitably than on the atonement of Christ, and justification      through his merits. With wonder we gaze on the love of Deity; with      profound awe we behold a God descending from heaven to earth.      Unbounded love! Unmeasured grace! And while in deep silence his      death wraps all nature; while his yielding"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],["title","The Story of My Life (#7)"],["body","rends the temple      and shakes earth's deep foundations; may my redeemed soul in silent      rapture tune her grateful song aloft; and fired by this      blood-bought theme, may I mend my pace towards my heavenly      inheritance!       I generally close up the labours of the day by writing a short      essay or theme on some religious subject. In doing this I have two      objects in view: the improvement of my mind and heart. And what      could be more appropriate than to close the day by reflection upon      God, and heaven, and time, and eternity? No private employment,      except that of prayer, have I found more pleasing and profitable      than this. Youth is the seed-time of the life that now is, as well      as of that which is to come. Youthful piety is the germ of true      honour, lawful prosperity, and everlasting blessedness. One day of      humble, devotional piety in youth will add more to our happiness at      the last end of life than a year of repentance and humiliation in      old age. I have no intention of entering the ministry, and yet I      prefer religious topics. To-day I have chosen the atonement of our      Lord, and have written a few thoughts on it.       _Sept. 2nd._--Implicit trust in a superintending Providence is a      constant source of comfort and support to me.       _Sept. 3rd._--God has blessed me to-day in my studies. I have also      felt the efficacy of Divine aid. Help me still, most merciful God!       _Sept. 4th._--In the course of the past week I have experienced      various feelings, especially with respect to the dealings of Divine      Providence with me; but in all I have had this consolation, that      whatever happens, \"the will of the Lord be done.\" It is my duty to      perform and obey.       _Sept. 5th._--This morning I attended church and heard a sermon on      Ezekiel xviii. 27. When we consider the importance of repentance,      its connection with our eternal happiness, surely every feeling      heart, and ministers especially, should exhibit with burning zeal      the conditions of salvation, the slavery of vice, the heinousness      of sin, the vanity of human glory, and the uncertainty of life.       _Sept. 6th._--When I laid aside my studies to commit my evening      thoughts to paper, my mind wandered on various subjects, until much      time was lost; the best antidote against this is, not to put off to      the next moment what can be done in this. We should be firm and      decided in all our pursuits, and whatever our minds \"find to do, do      it with all our might.\"       _Sept. 7th._--The mutual dependence of men cements society, and      their social intercourse communicates pleasure. If we are called to      endure the pains and inconveniences of poverty, possessing this we      forget all; and in the pleasant walks of wealth, it adds to every      elegance a charm. Friendship associated with religion, elevates all      the ties of Christian love and mutual pleasure.       _Sept. 8th._--I have found myself too much mingled with the common      crowd, and like others, too indifferent to the subject of all      others the chief.       _Sept. 9th._--We \"cannot serve God and Mammon.\" May I be firm in my      attachment to the Saviour, remembering that \"godliness has the      promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.\"       _Sept. 12th._--I heard a practical sermon on making our \"calling      and election sure,\" which closed with these words, \"He that calleth      upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" I felt condemned on      account of my negligence, and resolved, by God's help, to gain      victory over my tendency to inconsistencies of life and conduct.       _Sept. 14th._--I observe men embarked on the stream of time, and      carried forward with irresistible force to that universal port      which shall receive the whole human family. Amongst this passing      crowd, how few are there who reflect upon the design and end of      their voyage; surfeited with pleasure, involved in life's busy      concerns, the future, with its awful realities, is forgotten and      time, not eternity, is placed in the foreground.       _Sept, 15th._--In a letter to my brother George, to-day, I      said:--It would be superfluous for me to tell you that the letter I      received from you gave me unspeakable pleasure. Your fears with      respect to my injuring my health are groundless, for I must confess      I don't possess half that application and burning zeal in these      all-important pursuits that I ought to have. For who can estimate      the value of a liberal education? Who can sufficiently prize that      in which all the powers of the human mind can expand to their      utmost and astonishing extent? What industry can outstretch the      worth of that knowledge, by which we can travel back to the      remotest ages, and live the lives of all antiquity? Nay, who can      set bounds to the value of those attainments, by which we can, as      it were, fly from world to world, and gaze on all the glories of      creation; by which we can glide down the stream of time, and      penetrate the unorganized regions of uncreated futurity? My heart      burns while I write. Although literature presents the highest      objects of ambition to the most refined mind, yet I consider      health, in comparison with other temporal enjoyments, the most      bountiful, and highest gift of heaven.       I have read three books of the Georgics, and three odes of Horace,      but this last week I have read scarcely any, as I have had a great      deal of company, and there has been no school. But I commence again      to-day with all my might. The Attorney-General stops at Mr.      Aikman's during Court. I find him very agreeable. He conversed with      me more than an hour last night, in the most sociable, open manner      possible.       _Sept. 16th._--There is nothing of greater importance than to      commence early to form our characters and regulate our conduct.      Observation daily proves that man's condition in this world is      generally the result of his own conduct. When we come to maturity,      we perceive there is a right and a wrong in the actions of men;      many who possess the same hereditary advantages, are not equally      prosperous in life; some by virtuous conduct rise to      respectability, honour, and happiness; while others by mean and      vicious actions, forfeit the advantages of their birth, and sink      into ignominy and disgrace. How necessary that in early life useful      habits should be formed, and turbulent passions restrained, so that      when manhood and old age come, the mind be not enervated by the      follies and vices of youth, but, supported and strengthened by the      Divine Being, be enabled to say, \"O God, thou hast taught me from      my youth, and now when I am old and grey-headed, O God, thou wilt      not forsake me!\"       _Sept. 21st._--I have just parted with an old and faithful friend,      who has left for another kingdom. How often has he kindly reproved      me, and how oft have we gone to the house of God together! We may      never meet again on earth, but what a mercy to have a good hope of      meeting in the better land!       _Sept. 23rd._--When I reflect on the millions of the human family      who know nothing of Christ, my soul feels intensely for their      deliverance. What a vast uncultivated field in my own country for      ministers to employ their whole time and talents in exalting a      crucified Saviour. Has God designed this sacred task for me? If it      be Thy will, may all obstacles be removed, my heart be sanctified      and my hands made pure.       _Sept. 26th._--I have been much oppressed with a man-fearing      spirit, but what have I to fear if God be for me? Oh, Lord, enable      me to become a bold witness for Jesus Christ!       _Sept. 28th._--In all the various walks of life, I find      obstructions and labours, surrounded with foes, powerful as well      as subtle; although I have all the promises of the Gospel to      comfort and support me, yet find exertion on my own part absolutely      necessary. When heaven proclaims victory, it is only that which      succeeds labour. I consider it a divine requisition that my whole      course of conduct, both in political and social life, should be      governed by the infallible precepts of revelation; hypocrisy is      inexcusable, even in the most trifling circumstances.       _Sept. 29th._--I find difficulties to overcome in my literary      pursuits, I had never anticipated; and it is only by the most      indefatigable labour I can succeed. I am much oppressed by the      labours of this day. I need Divine aid in this as well as in      spiritual pursuits.       _Sept. 30th._--I have been enabled to study with considerable      facility. Prayer I find the most profitable employment, practice      the best instructor, and thanksgiving the sweetest recreation. May      this be my experience every day!       _October, 2nd._--I am another week nearer my eternal destiny! Am I      nearer heaven, and better prepared for death than at its      commencement? Do I view sin with greater abhorence? Are my views of      the Deity more enlarged? Is it my meat and drink to do his holy      will? Oh, my God, how much otherwise!       _From the 3rd to the 9th Oct._--During this period the afflicting      hand of God has been upon me; thank God, when distressed with      bodily pain, I have felt a firm assurance of Divine favour, so that      all fear of death has been taken away. My soul is too unholy to      meet a holy God, and mingle with the society of the blest. Oh, God,      save me from the deceitfulness of my own heart!       _Oct. 10th, Sabbath._--I am rapidly recovering health and strength.      The Lord is my refuge and comfort. Surrounded by temptations, the      applause of men is"]]]
