He lost track of time as he watched the Kerothi fleet take advantage of their superior tactical position and tear the Earth fleet to bits. Not until he saw the remains of the Earth fleet turn tail and run did he realize that the battle had been won.  The Kerothi fleet consolidated itself. There was no point in pursuing the fleeting Earth ships; that would only break up the solidity of the Kerothi deployment. The losers could afford to scatter; the winners could not. Early in the war, the Kerothi had used that trick against Earth; the Kerothi had broken and fled, and the Earth fleet had split up to chase them down. The scattered Earth ships had suddenly found that they had been led into traps composed of hidden clusters of Kerothi ships. Naturally, the trick had never worked again for either side.  \"All right,\" MacMaine said when it was all over, \"let's get on to Houston's World.\"  The staff men, including Tallis, were already on their feet, congratulating MacMaine and shaking his hands. Even General Hokotan, the Headquarters Staff man, who had been transferred temporarily to the Fleet Force to keep an eye on both MacMaine and Tallis, was enthusiastically pounding MacMaine's shoulder.  No one aboard was supposed to know that Hokotan was a Headquarters officer, but MacMaine had spotted the spy rather easily. There was a difference between the fighters of the Fleet and the politicoes of Headquarters. The politicoes were no harder, perhaps, nor more ruthless, than the fighters, but they were of a different breed. Theirs was the ruthlessness of the bully who steps on those who are weaker rather than the ruthlessness of the man who kills only to win a battle. MacMaine had the feeling that the Headquarters Staff preferred to spend their time browbeating their underlings rather than risk their necks with someone who could fight back, however weakly.  General Hokotan seemed to have more of the fighting quality than most HQ men, but he wasn't a Fleet Officer at heart. He couldn't be compared to Tallis without looking small and mean.  As a matter of cold fact, very few of the officers were in anyway comparable to Tallis--not even the Fleet men. The more MacMaine learned of the Kerothi, the more he realized just how lucky he had been that it had been Tallis, and not some other Kerothi general, who had been captured by the Earth forces. He was not at all sure that his plan would have worked at all with any of the other officers he had met.  Tallis, like MacMaine, was an unusual specimen of his race.                       *      *      *      *      *  MacMaine took the congratulations of the Kerothi officers with a look of pleasure on his face, and when they had subsided somewhat, he grinned and said:  \"Let's get a little work done around here, shall we? We have a planet to reduce yet.\"  They laughed. Reducing a planet didn't require strategy--only fire-power. The planet-based defenses couldn't maneuver, but the energy reserve of a planet is greater than that of any fleet, no matter how large. Each defense point would have to be cut down individually by the massed power of the fleet, cut down one by one until the planet was helpless. The planet as a whole might have more energy reserve than the fleet, but no individual defense point did. The problem was to avoid being hit by the rest of the defense points while one single point was bearing the brunt of the fleet's attack. It wasn't without danger, but it could be done.  And for a job like that, MacMaine's special abilities weren't needed. He could only watch and wait until it was over.  So he watched and waited. Unlike the short-time fury of a space battle, the reduction of a planet took days of steady pounding. When it was over, the blaster-boats of the Kerothi fleet and the shuttles from the great battle cruisers landed on Houston's World and took possession of the planet.                       *      *      *      *      *  MacMaine was waiting in his cabin when General Hokotan brought the news that the planet was secured.  \"They are ours,\" the HQ spy said with a superior smile. \"The sniveling animals didn't even seem to want to defend themselves. They don't even know how to fight a hand-to-hand battle. How could such things have ever evolved intelligence enough to conquer space?\" Hokotan enjoyed making such remarks to MacMaine's face, knowing that since MacMaine was technically a Kerothi he couldn't show any emotion when the enemy was insulted.  MacMaine showed none. \"Got them all, eh?\" he said.  \"All but a few who scattered into the hills and forests. But not many of them had the guts to leave the security of their cities, even though we were occupying them.\"  \"How many are left alive?\"  \"An estimated hundred and fifty million, more or less.\"  \"Good. That should be enough to set an example. I picked Houston's World because we can withdraw from it without weakening our position; its position in space is such that it would constitute no menace to us even if we never reduced it. That way, we can be sure that our little message is received on Earth.\"  Hokotan's grin was wolfish. \"And the whole weak-hearted race will shake with fear, eh?\"  \"Exactly. Tallis can speak English well enough to be understood. Have him make the announcement to them. He can word it however he likes, but the essence is to be this: Houston's World resisted the occupation by Kerothi troops; an example must be made of them to show them what happens to Earthmen who resist.\"  \"That's all?\"  \"That's enough. Oh, by the way, make sure that there are plenty of their cargo spaceships in good working order; I doubt that we've ruined them all, but if we have, repair some of them.  \"And, too, you'd better make sure that you allow some of the merchant spacemen to 'escape,' just in case there are no space pilots among those who took to the hills. We want to make sure that someone can use those ships to take the news back to Earth.\"  \"And the rest?\" Hokotan asked, with an expectant look. He knew what was to be done, but he wanted to hear MacMaine say it again.  MacMaine obliged.  \"Hang them. Every man, every woman, every child. I want them to be decorating every lamppost and roof-beam on the planet, dangling like overripe fruit when the Earth forces return.\"     _The Results_   \"I don't understand it,\" said General Polan Tallis worriedly. \"Where are they coming from? How are they doing it? What's happened?\"  MacMaine and the four Kerothi officers were sitting in the small dining room that doubled as a recreation room between meals. The nervous strain of the past few months was beginning to tell on all of them.  \"Six months ago,\" Tallis continued jerkily, \"we had them beaten. One planet after another was reduced in turn. Then, out of nowhere, comes a fleet of ships we didn't even know existed, and they've smashed us at every turn.\"  \"If they _are_ ships,\" said Loopat, the youngest officer of the _Shudos_ staff. \"Who ever heard of a battleship that was undetectable at a distance of less than half a million miles? It's impossible!\"  \"Then we're being torn to pieces by the impossible!\" Hokotan snapped. \"Before we even know they are anywhere around, they are blasting us with everything they've got! Not even the strategic genius of General MacMaine can help us if we have no time to plot strategy!\"  The Kerothi had been avoiding MacMaine's eyes, but now, at the mention of his name, they all looked at him as if their collective gaze had been drawn to him by some unknown attractive force.  \"It's like fighting ghosts,\" MacMaine said in a hushed voice. For the first time, he felt a feeling of awe that was almost akin to fear. What had he done?  In another sense, that same question was in the mind of the Kerothi.  \"Have you any notion at all what they are doing or how they are doing it?\" asked Tallis gently.  \"None,\" MacMaine answered truthfully. \"None at all, I swear to you.\"  \"They don't even behave like Earthmen,\" said the fourth Kerothi, a thick-necked officer named Ossif. \"They not only outfight us, they outthink us at every turn. Is it possible, General MacMaine, that the Earthmen have allies of another race, a race of intelligent beings that we don't know of?\" He left unsaid the added implication: \"_And that you have neglected to tell us about?_\"  \"Again,\" said MacMaine, \"I swear to you that I know nothing of any third intelligent race in the galaxy.\"  \"If there were such allies,\" Tallis said, \"isn't it odd that they should wait so long to aid their friends?\"  \"No odder than that the Earthmen should suddenly develop superweapons that we cannot understand, much less fight against,\" Hokotan said, with a touch of anger.  \"Not 'superweapons',\" MacMaine corrected almost absently. \"All they have is a method of making their biggest ships indetectable until they're so close that it doesn't matter. When they do register on our detectors, it's too late. But the weapons they strike with are the same type as they've always used, I believe.\"  \"All right, then,\" Hokotan said, his voice showing more anger. \"One weapon or whatever you want to call it. Practical invisibility. But that's enough. An invisible man with a knife is more deadly than a dozen ordinary men with modern armament. Are you sure you know nothing of this, General MacMaine?\"  Before MacMaine could answer, Tallis said, \"Don't be ridiculous, Hokotan! If he had known that such a weapon existed, would he have been fool enough to leave his people? With that secret, they stand a good chance of beating us in less than half the time it took us to wipe out their fleet--or, rather, to wipe out as much of it as we did.\"  \"They got a new fleet somewhere,\" said young Loopat, almost to himself.                       *      *      *      *      *  Tallis ignored him. \"If MacMaine deserted his former allegiance, knowing that they had a method of rendering the action of a space drive indetectable, then he was and is a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24313"],["title","Once a Week (#0)"],["body","A WEEK   BY THE SAME AUTHOR      THE DAY'S PLAY     THE HOLIDAY ROUND     THE SUNNY SIDE     ONCE ON A TIME     NOT THAT IT MATTERS     IF I MAY     FIRST PLAYS     SECOND PLAYS     MR.

THE HEIR     THE HEIR   I.--HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF  \"In less refined circles than ours,\" I said to Myra, \"your behaviour would be described as swank. Really, to judge from the airs you put on, you might be the child's mother.\"  \"He's jealous because he's not an aunt himself. Isn't he, ducksey darling?\"  \"I do wish you wouldn't keep dragging the baby into the conversation; we can make it go quite well as a duologue. As to being jealous--why, it's absurd. True, I'm not an aunt, but in a very short time I shall be an uncle by marriage, which sounds to me much superior. That is,\" I added, \"if you're still equal to it.\"  Myra blew me a kiss over the cradle.  \"Another thing you've forgotten,\" I went on, \"is that I'm down for a place as a godfather. Archie tells me that it isn't settled yet, but that there's a good deal of talk about it in the clubs. Who's the other going to be? Not Thomas, I suppose? That would be making the thing rather a farce.\"  \"Hasn't Dahlia broken it to you?\" said Myra anxiously.  \"Simpson?\" I asked, in an awed whisper.  Myra nodded. \"And, of course, Thomas,\" she said.  \"Heavens! Not three of us? What a jolly crowd we shall be. Thomas can play our best ball. We might----\"  \"But of course there are only going to be two godfathers,\" she said, and leant over the cradle again.  I held up my three end fingers. \"Thomas,\" I said, pointing to the smallest, \"me,\" I explained, pointing to the next, \"and Simpson, the tall gentleman in glasses. One, two, three.\"  \"Oh, baby,\" sighed Myra, \"what a very slow uncle by marriage you're going to have!\"  I stood and gazed at my three fingers for some time.  \"I've got it,\" I said at last, and I pulled down the middle one. \"The rumour in the clubs was unauthorized. I don't get a place after all.\"  \"_Don't_ say you mind,\" pleaded Myra. \"You see, Dahlia thought that as you were practically one of the family already, an uncle-elect by marriage, and as she didn't want to choose between Thomas and Samuel----\"  \"Say no more. I was only afraid that she might have something against my moral character. Child,\" I went on, rising and addressing the unresponsive infant, \"England has lost a godfather this day, but the world has gained a----what? I don't know. I want my tea.\"  Myra gave the baby a last kiss and got up.  \"Can I trust him with you while I go and see about Dahlia?\"  \"I'm not sure. It depends how I feel. I may change him with some poor baby in the village. Run away, aunt, and leave us men to ourselves. We have several matters to discuss.\"  When the child and I were alone together, I knelt by his cradle and surveyed his features earnestly. I wanted to see what it was he had to offer Myra which I could not give her. \"This,\" I said to myself, \"is the face which has come between her and me,\" for it was unfortunately true that I could no longer claim Myra's undivided attention. But the more I looked at him the more mysterious the whole thing became to me.  \"Not a bad kid?\" said a voice behind me.  I turned and saw Archie.  \"Yours, I believe,\" I said, and I waved him to the cradle.  Archie bent down and tickled the baby's chin, making appropriate noises the while--one of the things a father has to learn to do.  \"Who do you think he's like?\" he asked proudly.  \"The late Mr. Gladstone,\" I said, after deep thought.  \"Wrong. Hallo, here's Dahlia coming out. I hope, for your sake, that the baby's all right. If she finds he's caught measles or anything, you'll get into trouble.\"  By a stroke of bad luck the child began to cry as soon as he saw the ladies. Myra rushed up to him.  \"Poor little darling,\" she said soothingly. \"Did his uncle by marriage frighten him, then?\"  \"Don't listen to her, Dahlia,\" I said. \"I haven't done anything to him. We were chatting together quite amicably until he suddenly caught sight of Myra and burst into tears.\"  \"He's got a little pain,\" said Dahlia gently taking him up and patting him.  \"I think the trouble is mental,\" suggested Archie. \"He looks to me as if he had something on his conscience. Did he say anything to you about it when you were alone?\"  \"He didn't say much,\" I confessed, \"but he seemed to be keeping something back. I think he wants a bit of a run, really.\"  \"Poor little lamb,\" said Dahlia. \"There, he's better now, thank you.\" She looked up at Archie and me. \"I don't believe you two love him a bit.\"  Archie smiled at his wife and went over to the tea-table to pour out. I sat on the grass and tried to analyse my feelings to my nephew by marriage.  \"As an acquaintance,\" I said, \"he is charming; I know no one who is better company. If I cannot speak of his more solid qualities, it is only because I do not know him well enough. But to say whether I love him or not is difficult; I could tell you better after our first quarrel. However, there is one thing I must confess. I am rather jealous of him.\"  \"You envy his life of idleness?\"  \"No, I envy him the amount of attention he gets from Myra. The love she wastes on him which might be better employed on me is a heartrending thing to witness. As her betrothed I should expect to occupy the premier place in her affections, but, really, I sometimes think that if the baby and I both fell into the sea she would jump in and save the baby first.\"  \"Don't talk about his falling into the sea,\" said Dahlia, with a shudder; \"I can't a-bear it.\"  \"I think it will be all right,\" said Archie, \"I was touching wood all the time.\"  \"What a silly godfather he nearly had!\" whispered Myra at the cradle. \"It quite makes you smile, doesn't it, baby? Oh, Dahlia, he's just like Archie when he smiles!\"  \"Oh, yes, he's the living image of Archie,\" said Dahlia confidently.  I looked closely at Archie and then at the baby.  \"I should always know them apart,\" I said at last. \"That,\" and I pointed to the one at the tea-table, \"is Archie, and this,\" and I pointed to the one in the cradle, \"is the baby. But then I've such a wonderful memory for faces.\"  \"Baby,\" said Myra, \"I'm afraid you're going to know some very foolish people.\"   II.--HE MEETS HIS GODFATHERS  Thomas and Simpson arrived by the twelve-thirty train, and Myra and I drove down in the wagonette to meet them. Myra handled the ribbons (\"handled the ribbons\"--we must have that again) while I sat on the box-seat and pointed out any traction-engines and things in the road. I am very good at this.  \"I suppose,\" I said, \"there will be some sort of ceremony at the station? The station-master will read an address while his little daughter presents a bouquet of flowers. You don't often get two godfathers travelling by the same train. Look out,\" I said, as we swung round a corner, \"there's an ant coming.\"  \"What did you say? I'm so sorry, but I listen awfully badly when I'm driving.\"  \"As soon as I hit upon anything really good I'll write it down. So far I have been throwing off the merest trifles. When we are married, Myra----\"  \"Go on; I love that.\"  \"When we are married we shan't be able to afford horses, so we'll keep a couple of bicycles, and you'll be able to hear everything I say. How jolly for you.\"  \"All right,\" said"]]]
