Mr. SEDDON:--It appears to me that the mode pointed out by the resolution introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky, is neither the one most appropriate nor expeditious for accomplishing the result desired. We are convened under the invitation of the State of Virginia; and the same invitation that brings us here, proposes the basis for our deliberation and action. Virginia has stated what will be satisfactory to her; not as an _ultimatum_, but as a basis of adjustment. It appears to me that the proper course would be, to take up the propositions of Virginia--propose amendments to them--discuss them, and in the end determine how far they shall be adopted. The adoption of the resolution proposed, transfers the labors of this Conference, not in itself too large for convenient deliberation, to a committee. That committee is to discuss the various propositions offered and report the result. What, in the mean time, is this Conference to do? Nothing whatever! We are to meet here from day to day and adjourn, no one knows how long, until this committee reports, and then the discussion will commence which ought to commence now. Mr. PRESIDENT, if any thing is accomplished, it must be accomplished speedily. Events are on the wing. Already in my State the delegates are elected to a Convention, which is to meet next week, to consider the subject which now engrosses the minds of the American people. I hope my suggestion may meet with favor in the Conference.  Mr. EWING:--I cannot agree with the gentleman from Virginia, for reasons which must be obvious to all. I do not think Virginia intended to dictate the terms upon which we were to act. I am in favor of the resolution, but would make one suggestion in relation to it. By its terms the committee is to report on Friday, if it can properly do so. I suggest that the committee should have leave to sit during the sessions of the Conference. In this way our business may be greatly expedited.  Mr. GUTHRIE:--It gives me pleasure to accept the modification proposed by the gentleman from Ohio. I should have incorporated it into my resolution.  The resolution as modified was then adopted by the Conference without a division.  The PRESIDENT:--I will take this occasion to announce a committee to carry into effect the determination of the Conference relating to the obtaining of the services of clergymen to open the proceedings of the Conference daily with prayer. The Chair appoints as such committee, Mr. RANDOLPH, of New Jersey, Mr. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky, and Mr. JOHNSON, of Maryland.  Mr. JOHNSON:--It appears to me very appropriate, in view of the occasion which has brought us together, that the members of this Conference should pay their respects in a body to the President of the United States. I therefore move that we call upon him in a body at such a time as will be most agreeable to him; such time to be ascertained by the President of this Conference.  Which motion was unanimously agreed to.  Mr. CLAY:--I move the reconsideration of the vote by which the portion of the report of the Committee on Rules and Organization not yet adopted was recommitted to that committee. I do this in order that the Conference may now proceed to the consideration of those rules which may be adopted without much difference of opinion.  The vote was thereupon reconsidered, and the following rules were severally read and adopted. The remaining rules recommended were recommitted to the committee:   RULES.  I. A Convention to do business, shall consist of the Commissioners of not less than seven States; and all questions shall be decided by the greater number of those which be fully represented. But a less number than seven may adjourn from day to day.  II. Immediately after the President shall have taken the chair, and the members their seats, the minutes of the preceding day shall be read by the Secretary.  III. Every member, rising to speak, shall address the President; and while he shall be speaking none shall pass between them, or hold discourse with another, or read a book, pamphlet, or paper, printed or manuscript; and of two members rising to speak at the same time, the President shall name him who shall first be heard.  IV. A member shall not speak oftener than twice, without special leave upon the same question; and not a second time before every other who had been silent shall have been heard, if he choose to speak upon the subject.  V. A motion made and seconded, shall be repeated; and if written, as it shall be when any member shall so require, read aloud by the Secretary before it shall be debated; and may be withdrawn at any time before the vote upon it shall have been declared.  VI. Orders of the day shall be read next after the minutes, and either discussed or postponed, before any other business shall be introduced.  VII. When a debate shall arise upon a question, no motion, other than to amend the question, to commit it, or to postpone the debate, shall be received.  VIII. A question which is complicated, shall, at the request of any member, be divided and put separately upon the propositions of which it is compounded.  IX. A writing which contains any matter brought on to be considered, shall be read once, throughout, for information; then by paragraphs, to be debated, and again with the amendments, if any, made on the second reading, and afterwards the question shall be put upon the whole, as amended or approved in the original form, as the case may be.  X. Committees shall be appointed by the President, unless otherwise ordered by the Convention.  XI. A member may be called to order by another member, as well as by the President, and may be allowed to explain his conduct or expressions supposed to be reprehensible. And all questions of order shall be decided by the President, without appeal or debate.  XII. Upon a question to adjourn for the day, which may be made at any time, if it be seconded, the question shall be put without debate.  XIII. When the Convention shall adjourn, every member shall stand in his place until the President pass him.  XIV. That no member be absent from the Convention, so as to interrupt the representation of the State, without leave.  XV. That Committees do not sit while the Convention shall be, or ought to be sitting, without leave of the Convention.  XVI. That no copy be taken of any entry on the Journal, during the sitting of the Convention, without leave of the Convention.  XVII. That members only be permitted to inspect the Journal.  XVIII. _Mode of Voting._ All votes shall be taken by States, and each State to give one vote. The yeas and nays of the members shall not be given or published--only the decision by States.  After the adoption of the foregoing Rules, the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.     FOURTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, _February 7th, 1861._   The Conference convened, pursuant to the adjournment yesterday, at 10 o'clock A.M.  It was called to order by President TYLER, and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. PYNE, of Washington.  The Journal of yesterday was read, and after sundry amendments, was approved.  Messrs. J.H. PULESTON, JOHN STRYKER, W.W. HOPPIN, Jr., and ---- Olcott, took their places as Assistant Secretaries.  President TYLER:--Gentlemen of the Conference, as directed by the resolution which you adopted yesterday, I addressed a note to the President of the United States, asking at what hour it would be agreeable to him that this Conference should call on him in a body. To this note I have received a reply which will be read by the Secretary.  The Secretary then read the following note from the President:       EXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 6th, 1861._       My DEAR SIR:--I shall feel greatly honored to receive the      gentlemen composing the Convention of Commissioners from the      several States, on any day and at any hour most convenient      to themselves. I shall name to-morrow (Thursday) at 11 or 3      o'clock, though any other time would be equally agreeable to      me. I shall at all times be prepared to give them a cordial      welcome.       Yours, very respectfully,       JAMES BUCHANAN.       His Excellency, JOHN TYLER.  The PRESIDENT:--What order will the Conference take upon the subject?  Mr. GUTHRIE:--I move that the members of this Conference call in a body upon the President of the United States this morning, at 11 o'clock.  Mr. GUTHRIE'S motion was adopted unanimously.  Mr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials further to report, that the committee have examined the credentials of the following gentlemen, and find them duly accredited as members of this body:  _New York._--William E. Dodge.  _Tennessee._--Samuel Milligan, Josiah M. Anderson, Robert L. Carruthers, Thomas Martin, Isaac R. Hawkins, R.J. McKinney, Alvin Cullom, William P. Hickerson, George W. Jones, F.K. Zollicoffer, William H. Stephens, A.W.O. Totten.  _Illinois._--John Wood, Stephen T. Logan, John M. Palmer, Burton C. Cook, Thomas J. Turner.  Which report was accepted, and the names of the Commissioners were entered upon the record.  Mr. WICKLIFFE:--Certain printing has been ordered, but no provision has been made for paying for it. The Committee on Rules have therefore requested me to report the following resolution:       _Resolved_, That the Secretary procure for the use of the      Convention the necessary stationery, and also provide for      such printing as may be ordered. That the Journal, up to and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24561"],["title","A Report of the Debates and Proceedings in the Secret Sessions of the Conference (#5)"],["body","this day's proceeding, as well as the Rules, be      printed for the use of the members.  The resolution of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.  The PRESIDENT:--The respective delegations have recommended, and the Chair announces the names of the following gentlemen to compose the committee ordered to be raised under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE, which was adopted yesterday:--New Hampshire, Asa Fowler; Vermont, Hiland Hall; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Samuel Ames; Connecticut, Roger S. Baldwin; New Jersey, Joseph F. Randolph; Pennsylvania, Thomas White; Delaware, Daniel M. Bates; North Carolina, Thomas Ruffin; Kentucky, James Guthrie; Ohio, Thomas Ewing; Indiana, Caleb B. Smith; Illinois, Stephen T. Logan; Iowa, James Harlan; Maryland, Reverdy Johnson; Virginia, James A. Seddon.  Mr. WICKLIFFE:--The Committee on Rules have further considered the rule relating to the secrecy of the debates and proceedings of this body, and their convictions as to the necessity and propriety of its adoption remain unchanged. The prospect of an ultimate agreement among the Commissioners composing this body, in the opinion of the committee, would be materially lessened if all or any of its debates should be made public, for reasons which have already been stated. If any gentleman should desire to communicate with the Executive or Legislative authorities of his State any facts, during the progress of our business, I apprehend little difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the leave of the Convention. We therefore recommend the following Rule:       XIX. That nothing spoken in the Convention be printed, or      otherwise published or communicated, without leave.  Mr. SEDDON:--I do not desire to discuss the adoption of the rule under consideration any further than I have already. The Commissioners from the State of Virginia are appointed under resolutions which make it their duty to communicate from time to time with her deliberative assemblies. We do not wish to have our right to do so subject to the action of this or any other body. It is no answer to this to say, that there is no doubt that the leave to make the necessary communications will be accorded to us when we ask it. We do not wish to ask it. We insist upon our rights in this respect, as it is our duty to the State that sent us here to do.  The rule was adopted upon a count of the members voting.  On motion, the Convention adjourned.  After the adjournment, the Convention in a body called upon the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, when the several delegations were introduced by President TYLER, and the several Commissioners were presented by the chairmen of the several delegations.     FIFTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 8th, 1861._   The Convention was called to order at 12 o'clock by President TYLER. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. BUTLER. After sundry amendments, the Journal was approved.  Mr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report that they find the following gentlemen duly accredited as members of the Convention:  _New York._--David Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S. Wadsworth, Erastus Corning, Amaziah B. James, James C. Smith, Addison Gardner, Greene C. Bronson, John A. King, John E. Wool.  _Massachusetts._--John Z. Goodrich, John M. Forbes, Richard P. Waters, Theophilus P. Chandler, Francis B. Crowninshield, George S. Boutwell, Charles Allen.  _Missouri._--John D. Coalter, Alexander W. Doniphan, Waldo P. Johnson, Aylett H. Buckner, Harrison Hough.  On motion of the respective delegations the following gentlemen were added to the committee raised on the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE:  _New York._--Mr. Field. _Missouri._--Mr. Doniphan. _Tennessee._--Mr. Zollicoffer.  Mr. GUTHRIE:--I am instructed by the committee raised upon the resolution introduced by myself, to inform the Convention that that body is not able to report to-day, agreeable to the suggestion made at the time they were appointed. Several States are yet unrepresented on the committee, and delegations from some of them have only arrived this morning. I am therefore directed to ask for further time to make a report, assuring the Convention, at the same time, that a report will be made at soon as a proper regard to the interests of all sections will permit it to be done.  Mr. CLAY:--I move that the time for the report of the committee be extended until Monday next. As in the mean time there will be little business for the Convention to do, and that of a formal character, it might be as well to adjourn from this time until Monday; and I move further, that if delegates arrive from States now unrepresented, they may present their credentials to the committee, and if no question arises on them, they may then select a member of the committee on Mr. GUTHRIE'S resolution, and report his name to the Secretary of that committee.  Mr. SEDDON:--I object to an adjournment until Monday. We can meet here to-morrow and do any business which may come before us.  The several motions of Mr. CLAY, with the alteration suggested by Mr. SEDDON, were then agreed to without a division.  Mr. ELLIS:--I move that the President be requested to issue cards of admission to the members and officers of this Convention.  Which motion was adopted.  Mr. HITCHCOCK:--I would like to understand whether we all construe the rule referring to the secrecy of our transactions alike. I am told that different constructions are placed upon it by different members, and would suggest the propriety of the PRESIDENT'S giving his views of the meaning of the rule.  The PRESIDENT:--I understand, by the correct interpretation of the rule, that nothing which is said or done in the Convention having reference to any subject of business in it, can be spoken of or disclosed to any but members.  The Convention then adjourned.     SIXTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 9th, 1861._   The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. BULLOCK. The Journal was read, corrected, and approved.  Mr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report as members of this Convention the names of the following gentlemen from the State of Maine:--William P. Fessenden, Lot M. Morrill, Daniel E. Somes, John J. Perry, Ezra B. French, Freeman H. Morse, Stephen Coburn, Stephen C. Foster.  Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, and Mr. CROWNINSHIELD, of Massachusetts, were announced as members of the committee under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE.  Mr. TUCK:--I offer certain resolutions, which I desire to have printed and referred to the Committee on Resolutions.  The resolutions of Mr. TUCK were read, ordered to be printed, and referred. (These resolutions will be found on a subsequent page.)  Mr. CLAY:--I hold in my hand the proceedings of a very large Democratic meeting recently held at New Haven, in the State of Connecticut. Among them are certain resolutions, breathing a spirit of fervent devotion to the Union, and expressing an anxious desire for the settlement of the difficult questions now before the country. They have been sent to me with a request that I should lay them before this Convention. Why I was selected by them for the performance of this duty, I do not know, unless it was because, from my name and associations, they thought an assurance might be found that I participated in the sentiments expressed in the resolutions. I present them with great pleasure, and ask that they may be referred to the Committee on Resolutions.  The motion of Mr. CLAY was agreed to.  Mr. RANDOLPH:--I move that the Secretary be requested to furnish for the use of the members a printed list of the delegates to and officers of this Convention.  Which motion was adopted, and the Convention adjourned.     SEVENTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 11th, 1861._   The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY.  After the reading and amendment of the Journal, Mr. GUTHRIE, from the Committee on Resolutions, asked for further time to make a general report of the matters submitted to them, which was given; and thereupon Mr. GUTHRIE, from the same Committee, made the following report upon the resolutions of a meeting in the State of Connecticut, which were referred to that committee on motion of Mr. CLAY:       The committee to whom were referred certain resolutions of      the Democratic party of the State of Connecticut, report      that in the opinion of the committee it is inexpedient for      this Convention to act upon any resolution purporting to      emanate from any political party whatever; and that the      member of the Convention by whom they were presented have      leave to withdraw the same.  The PRESIDENT:--I take this opportunity to announce to the Convention that the Door-keeper of the House of Representatives has transmitted to the Chair cards admitting members of this body on to the floor of the House. These cards will be delivered by the Secretary to such members as call for them.  Mr. CHASE:--I move that any propositions or resolutions which members of this Convention desire to have considered by the Committee on Resolutions and Propositions, may be presented to the committee through the Secretary, without being presented in Convention.  The motion was agreed to, and on motion the Convention adjourned until Wednesday the 13th instant, at 12 o'clock M.     EIGHTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 13th, 1861._   The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT, and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. EDWARDS. The Journal, after sundry amendments, was approved.  Mr. GUTHRIE:--The Committee on Resolutions, &c., have labored diligently, and held protracted sessions, in the hope of being able to make their report to-day. This they find themselves unable to do. They are fully impressed with the necessity of immediate action, in view of the short time that will remain for Congress to consider the action of this Convention, if it shall become necessary "]]]
