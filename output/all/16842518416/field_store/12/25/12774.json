No matter whether we got there early or late, the _Panada_ was always full. As soon as we sat down we began our dinner by wiping our glasses, plates, forks, spoons, and knives on our napkins, making such a habit of it that I remember afterwards at a dinner-party in London catching myself with my glass in my hand and stopping only just in time, while Duveneck, on another occasion, got as far as the silver before he was held up by the severe eye of his hostess. Probably it was because nobody could hear what anybody said that everybody talked together. I cannot recall a moment when stray musicians were not strumming on guitars and mandolins, and the oyster man was not shrieking: \"_Ostreche!_ _Fresche! Ostreche!_\" though nobody paid the least attention to him or ever bought one of his oysters. And above the uproar was the continuous cry: \"_Ecco me! Vengo subito! Mezzo Verona! Due Calomai! Vengo subito! Ecco me!_\" of the waiters, who, though they never ceased to announce their coming, were so slow to come that many diners brought a course or two in their pockets to occupy them during the intervals.  The little Venetian at the next table was sure to produce a bunch of radishes while he waited for his soup; on market days, when there was more of a crowd than ever, few of the many baked potatoes eaten at almost every table had seen the inside of the _Panada's_ oven; often the shops that fill the Venetian _calli_ with the perpetual smell of frying and where the brasses and the blue-and-white used to shine, were patronized on the way--if dinner has to be collected in the streets, no town, even in Italy, offers such facilities as Venice. From _Minestra_ to fruit and cheese, the Venetian in a few minutes' walk may pick up a substantial dinner and carry it to the rooms or the street corner where it is his habit to dine. Vance, the painter, who sometimes favoured us at our table with his company, went further and, after he had taken off his coat and put on his hat and emptied his pockets, seldom troubled the establishment to provide him with more than a glass, a plate, a knife, and a fork, for the price of a _quinto_ of Verona. His first, and as it turned out his last, more extravagant order, was the event of the season. The _padrone_ discussed it with him and a message was sent to the cook that the dish was _di bistecca_. When it came it was not cooked enough to suit Vance. A second was cooked too much. The third was done to a turn. In the bill, however, were the three, and voices were lowered, mandolins and guitars were stilled, the oyster man forgot his shriek, during the five awful minutes when Vance and the _padrone_ had it out. After that Vance made another _trattoria_ the richer by his daily _quinto_.  J. and I had our five minutes with the _padrone_ later on once when Rossi, our waiter, was so slow that our patience gave out and we shook the dust of the _Panada_ from our feet. But we could not shake off Rossi. He had arrived with our dinner just as we were vanishing from the door and was made to pay for it. After that his leisure was spent in trying to make us pay him back and he would appear at our bedroom door, or waylay us on the _Riva_, or follow us into the _Orientale_, or run us down in the _Piazza_, demanding the money as a right, begging for it as a charity, reducing it by a _centesimo_ every time until we had only to wait long enough for the debt to be wiped out. But this was at the end of our stay in Venice, and months of dining at the _Panada_ had passed before then.   III  [Illustration: Etching by Joseph Pennell THE CAFÉ ORIENTALE, VENICE]  I would be as puzzled to explain the attraction of the _Orientale_ on the _Riva_, unless it was the opportunity it offered for economy. In the _Piazza_, at the _Quadri_ and _Florian's_, which are to the other _cafés_ of Venice what St. Mark's is to the other churches, coffee was twenty _centesimi_ and the waiter expected five more, but at the _Orientale_ it was eighteen and the waiter was satisfied with the change from twenty, which meant for us the saving every night of almost half a cent. The _Orientale_ was by comparison as quiet and deserted as the _Panada_ was crowded and noisy. Outside, tables looked upon the Lagoon and the façade of _San Giorgio_, white in the night. In a big, new, gilded room sailors and sergeants played checkers and more serious Venetians worked out dismal problems in chess. But Duveneck's corner was in the older, shabby, stuffy, low-ceilinged room, and having once settled there we never wanted to move. As a rule we shared it with only an elderly Englishman and his son who read the _Standard_ in the opposite corner--after our race with them to the _café_, the winners getting the one English paper first--and we were seldom intruded upon or interrupted except by the occasional visit of the _caramei_ man with his brass tray of candied fruit, impaled on thin sticks, like little birds on a skewer, which led us into our one extravagance.  Had the old room been seedier and duller--dull our company never was--I still would have seen it through the glamour of youth and thought it the one place in which to study Venice and Venetian life. But nobody who ever sat there with us could have complained of dulness so long as Duveneck presided at our table. In Duveneck's case I cannot help breaking my golden rule never to speak in print of the living--rules were made to be broken. And why shouldn't I? I might as well not write at all about our nights in Venice as to leave him out of them, he who held them together and fashioned them into what they were. In the _Atlantic_, as a makeshift, I called him Inglehart, the disguise under which he figures in one of Howells's novels. But why not call him boldly by his name when Inglehart is the thinnest and flimsiest of masks, as friends of his were quick to tell me, and Duveneck means so much more to all who know--and all who do not know are not worth bothering about. It was only yesterday at San Francisco that the artists of America gave an unmistakable proof of what their opinion of Duveneck is now. In the Eighties \"the boys\" already thought as much of him and a hundred times more.  Duveneck, as I remember him then--I have seen him but once since--was large, fair, golden-haired, with long drooping golden moustache, of a type apt to suggest indolence and indifference. As he lolled against the red velvet cushions smoking his Cavour, enjoying the talk of others as much as his own or more--for he had the talent of eloquent silence when he chose to cultivate it--his eyes half shut, smiling with casual benevolence, he may have looked to a stranger incapable of action, and as if he did not know whether he was alone or not, and cared less. And yet he had a big record of activity behind him, young as he was; he always inspired activity in others, he was rarely without a large and devoted following. He it was who drew \"the boys\" to Munich, then from Munich to Florence, and then from Florence to Venice, and \"the boys\" have passed into the history of American Art and the history of Venice--wouldn't that give me away and explain who he was if I called him Inglehart dozens of times over? And he also it was who packed them off again before they learnt how easy it is to be content in Venice without doing anything at all, though I used to fancy that he would have been rather glad to indulge in that content himself. How far he was from the pleasant Venetian habit of idling all day, his Venetian etchings, at which he was working that spring--the etchings that on their appearance in London were the innocent cause of a stirring chapter in _The Gentle Art_--are an enduring proof. And I knew a good deal of what was going on in his studio at the time, for J. spent many busy hours with him there, while I, left to my own devices, stared industriously from the windows of the _Casa Kirsch_, making believe I was gathering material, or strolled along the _Riva_ pretending it was to market for my midday meal, though the baker was almost next door, and the man from whom I bought the little dried figs that nowhere are so dried and shrivelled up as in Venice, was seldom more than a minute away. I can see now, when I consider how my Venetian days were spent, that I came perilously near to sinking to the deepest depths of Venetian idleness myself.  We were never alone with Duveneck at the _Orientale_. The American Consul was sure to drop in, as he had for so many years that half his occupation would have gone if he hadn't dropped in any longer. Martin joined us because he loved to argue anybody into a temper and, as he was an awful bore, succeeded with most people. He could drive me to proving that white was black, to overturning all my most cherished idols, or to forgetting my timidity and laying down the law upon any point of art he might bring up. Duveneck alone refused to be roused and Martin, who could not understand or accept his failure, was forever coming back, making himself a bigger bore than ever, by trying again. But Shinn was the only man I ever knew to put Duveneck into something like a temper, and that was by asking him deferentially one night if he did not think St. Mark's a very fine church--the next minute, however, calming him down by inviting him out \"in my gandler.\"  Arnold was as regular in attendance. He found the _café_ as comfortable a place to sleep in as any other. Like Sancho Panza he had a talent for sleeping. He had made his name and fame as one of the Harvard baseball team in I will not say what year, and sleep had been his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24459"],["title","The Lost Princess of Oz (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

This pleases me. Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination has given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine and the automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities. So I believe that dreams--day dreams, you know, with your eyes wide open and your brain-machinery whizzing--are likely to lead to the betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman most apt to create, to invent, and therefore to foster civilization. A prominent educator tells me that fairy tales are of untold value in developing imagination in the young. I believe it.  Among the letters I receive from children are many containing suggestions of \"what to write about in the next Oz Book.\" Some of the ideas advanced are mighty interesting, while others are too extravagant to be seriously considered--even in a fairy tale. Yet I like them all, and I must admit that the main idea in \"The Lost Princess of Oz\" was suggested to me by a sweet little girl of eleven who called to see me and to talk about the Land of Oz. Said she: \"I s'pose if Ozma ever got lost, or stolen, ev'rybody in Oz would be dreadful sorry.\"  That was all, but quite enough foundation to build this present story on. If you happen to like the story, give credit to my little friend's clever hint. And, by the way, don't hesitate to write me your own hints and suggestions, such as result from your own day dreams. They will be sure to interest me, even if I cannot use them in a story, and the very fact that you have dreamed at all will give me pleasure and do you good. For, after all, dear reader, these stories of Oz are just yours and mine, and we are partners. As long as you care to read them I shall try to write them, and I've an idea that the next one will relate some startling adventures of the \"Tin Woodman of Oz\" and his comrades.    L.

She had completely disappeared. Not one of her subjects--not even her closest friends--knew what had become of her.  It was Dorothy who first discovered it. Dorothy was a little Kansas girl who had come to the Land of Oz to live and had been given a delightful suite of rooms in Ozma's royal palace, just because Ozma loved Dorothy and wanted her to live as near her as possible, so the two girls might be much together.  Dorothy was not the only girl from the outside world who had been welcomed to Oz and lived in the royal palace. There was another named Betsy Bobbin, whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with Ozma, and still another named Trot, who had been invited, together with her faithful companion, Cap'n Bill, to make her home in this wonderful fairyland. The three girls all had rooms in the palace and were great chums; but Dorothy was the dearest friend of their gracious Ruler and only she at any hour dared to seek Ozma in her royal apartments. For Dorothy had lived in Oz much longer than the other girls and had been made a Princess of the realm.  Betsy was a year older than Dorothy and Trot was a year younger, yet the three were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to have nice times together. It was while the three were talking together one morning in Dorothy's room that Betsy proposed they make a journey into the Munchkin Country, which was one of the four great countries of the Land of Oz ruled by Ozma.  [Illustration]  \"I've never been there yet,\" said Betsy Bobbin, \"but the Scarecrow once told me it is the prettiest country in all Oz.\"  \"I'd like to go, too,\" added Trot.  \"All right,\" said Dorothy, \"I'll go and ask Ozma. Perhaps she will let us take the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, which would be much nicer for us than having to walk all the way. This Land of Oz is a pretty big place, when you get to all the edges of it.\"  So she jumped up and went along the halls of the splendid palace until she came to the royal suite, which filled all the front of the second floor. In a little waiting room sat Ozma's maid, Jellia Jamb, who was busily sewing.  \"Is Ozma up yet?\" inquired Dorothy.  \"I don't know, my dear,\" replied Jellia. \"I haven't heard a word from her this morning. She hasn't even called for her bath or her breakfast, and it is far past her usual time for them.\"  \"That's strange!\" exclaimed the little girl.  \"Yes,\" agreed the maid; \"but of course no harm could have happened to her. No one can die or be killed in the Land of Oz and Ozma is herself a powerful fairy, and she has no enemies, so far as we know. Therefore I am not at all worried about her, though I must admit her silence is unusual.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully, \"she has overslept. Or she may be reading, or working out some new sort of magic to do good to her people.\"  \"Any of these things may be true,\" replied Jellia Jamb, \"so I haven't dared disturb our royal mistress. You, however, are a privileged character, Princess, and I am sure that Ozma wouldn't mind at all if you went in to see her.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy, and opening the door of the outer chamber she went in. All was still here. She walked into another room, which was Ozma's boudoir, and then, pushing back a heavy drapery richly broidered with threads of pure gold, the girl entered the sleeping-room of the fairy Ruler of Oz. The bed of ivory and gold was vacant; the room was vacant; not a trace of Ozma was to be found.  Very much surprised, yet still with no fear that anything had happened to her friend, Dorothy returned through the boudoir to the other rooms of the suite. She went into the music room, the library, the laboratory, the bath, the wardrobe and even into the great throne room, which adjoined the royal suite, but in none of these places could she find Ozma.  So she returned to the anteroom where she had left the maid, Jellia Jamb, and said:  \"She isn't in her rooms now, so she must have gone out.\"  \"I don't understand how she could do that without my seeing her,\" replied Jellia, \"unless she made herself invisible.\"  \"She isn't there, anyhow,\" declared Dorothy.  \"Then let us go find her,\" suggested the maid, who appeared to be a little uneasy.  So they went into the corridors and there Dorothy almost stumbled over a queer girl who was dancing lightly along the passage.  \"Stop a minute, Scraps!\" she called. \"Have you seen Ozma this morning?\"  \"Not I!\" replied the queer girl, dancing nearer. \"I lost both my eyes in a tussle with the Woozy, last night, for the creature scraped 'em both off my face with his square paws. So I put the eyes in my pocket and this morning Button-Bright led me to Aunt Em, who sewed 'em on again. So "]]]
