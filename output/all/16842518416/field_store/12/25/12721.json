I have cut little paths all through it just big enough for Mrs. Peter and myself.  None of our enemies can get at us there, excepting Shadow the Weasel or Billy Mink.  I have a sort of nest there where I spend my time when I am not running about.  It is called a form and I sit in it a great deal.”  “In summer I eat clover, grass and other green things, and I just love to get over into Farmer Brown's garden.  In winter I have to take what I can get, and this is mostly bark from young trees, buds and tender twigs of bushes, and any green plants I can find under the snow.  I can run fast for a short distance, but only for a short distance.  That is why I like thick brush and bramble-tangles.  There I can dodge.  I don't know any one who can beat me at dodging.  If Reddy Fox or Bowser the Hound surprises me away from the dear Old Briar-patch I run for the nearest hollow log or hole in the ground.  Sometimes in summer I dig a hole for myself, but not often.  It is much easier to use a hole somebody else has dug.  When I want to signal my friends I thump the ground with my hind feet.  Jumper does the same thing.  I forgot to say I don't like water.”  Old Mother Nature smiled.  “You are thinking of that cousin of yours, the Marsh Rabbit who lives way down in the Sunny South,”  said she.  Peter looked a wee bit foolish and admitted that he was. Jumper the Hare was all interest at once.  You see, he had never heard of this cousin.  “That was a very good account of yourself, Peter,” said Old Mother Nature.  “Now take a look at your cousin, Jumper the Hare, and tell me how he differs from you.”  Peter took a long look at Jumper, and then, as before, scratched one ear with a long hind foot.  “In the first place,” said he, “Jumper is considerably bigger than I.  He has very long hind legs and his ears are very long.  In summer he wears a brown coat, but in winter he is all white but the tips of those long ears, and those are black.  Because his coat changes so, he is called the varying Hare.  He likes the Green Forest where the trees grow close together, especially those places where there are a great many young trees.  He's the biggest member of our family.  I guess that's all I know about Cousin Jumper.”  “That is very good, Peter, as far as it goes,” said Old Mother Nature.  “You have made only one mistake.  Jumper is not the biggest of his family.”  Both Peter and Jumper opened their eyes very wide with surprise. “Also,” continued Old Mother Nature, “you forgot to mention the fact that Jumper never hides in hollow logs and holes in the ground as you do.  Why don't you, Jumper?”  “I wouldn't feel safe there,” replied Jumper rather timidly.  “I depend on my long legs for safety, and the way I can dodge around trees and bushes.  I suppose Reddy Fox may be fast enough to catch me in the open, but he can't do it where I can dodge around trees and bushes.  That is why I stick to the Green Forest.  If you please, Mother Nature, what is this about a cousin who likes to swim?”  Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled.  “We'll get to that later on,”  said she.  “Now, each of you hold up a hind foot and tell me what difference you see.”  Peter and Jumper each held up a hind foot and each looked first at his own and then at the other's.  “They look to me very much alike, only Jumper's is a lot longer and bigger than mine,” said Peter.  Jumper nodded as if he agreed.  “What's the matter with your eyes?” demanded Old Mother Nature. “Don't you see that Jumper's foot is a great deal broader than yours, Peter, and that his toes are spread apart, while yours are close together?”  Peter and Jumper looked sheepish, for it was just as Old Mother Nature had said.  Jumper's foot really was quite different from that of Peter.  Peter's was narrow and slim.  “That is a very important difference,” declared Old Mother Nature. “Can you guess why I gave you those big feet, Jumper?”  Jumper slowly shook his head.  “Not unless it was to make me different,” said he.  “I'm surprised,” said Old Mother Nature.  “Yes, indeed, I'm surprised.  You ought to know by this time that I never give anybody anything without a purpose.  What happens to those big feet of yours in the winter, Jumper?”  “Nothing that I know of, excepting that the hair grows out long between my toes,” Jumper replied.  “Exactly,” snapped Old Mother Nature.  “And when the hair does this you can travel over light snow without sinking in.  It is just as if you had snowshoes.  That is why you are often called a Snowshoe Rabbit.  I gave you those big feet and make the hair grow out every winter because I know that you depend on your legs to get away from your enemies.  You can run over the deep snow where your enemies break through.  Peter, though he is small and lighter than you are, cannot go where you can.  But Peter doesn't need to depend always on his legs to save his life.  There is one thing more that I want you both to notice, and that is that you both have quite a lot of short hairs on the soles of you feet.  That is where you differ from that cousin of yours down in the Sunny South.  He has only a very few hairs on his feet.  That is so he can swim better.”  “If you please, Mother Nature, why is that cousin of ours so fond of the water?” piped up Peter.  “Because,” replied Old Mother Nature, “he lives in marshy country where there is a great deal of water.  He is very nearly the same size as you, Peter, and looks very much like you.  But his legs are not quite so long, his ears are a little smaller, and his tail is brownish instead of white.  He is a poor runner and so in time of danger he takes to the water.  For that matter, he goes swimming for pleasure.  The water is warm down there, and he dearly loves to paddle about in it.  If a Fox chases him he simply plunges into the water and hides among the water plants with only his eyes and his nose out of water.”  “Does he make his home in the water like Jerry Muskrat?” asked Peter innocently.  Mother Nature smiled and shook her head.  “Certainly not,” she replied.  “His home is on the ground.  His babies are born in a nest made just as Mrs. Peter makes her nest for your babies, and Mrs. Jumper makes a nest for Jumper's babies.  It is made of grass and lined with soft fur which Mrs. Rabbit pulls from her own breast, and it is very carefully hidden.  By the way, Peter how do your babies differ from the babies of your Cousin Jumper?”  Peter shook his head.  “I don't know,” said he.  “My babies don't have their eyes open when they are born, and they haven't any hair.”  Jumper pricked up his long ears.  “What's that?” said he. “Why, my babies have their eyes open and have the dearest little fur coats!”  Old Mother Nature chuckled.  “That is the difference,” said she. “I guess both of you have learned something.”  “You said a little while ago that Jumper isn't the biggest of our family,” said Peter.  “If you please, who is?”  “There are several bigger than Jumper,” replied Old Mother Nature, and smiled as she saw the funny look of surprise on the faces of Peter and Jumper.  “There is one way up the Frozen North and there are two cousins way out in the Great West.  They are as much bigger than Jumper as Jumper is bigger than you, Peter.  But I haven't time to tell you about them now.  If you really want to learn about them, be here promptly at sun-up to-morrow morning. Hello!  Here comes Reddy Fox, and he looks to me as if a good breakfast would not come amiss.  Let me see what you have learned about taking care of yourselves.”  Peter and Jumper gave one startled look in the direction Mother Nature was pointing.  Sure enough, there was Reddy Fox.  Not far away was a hollow log.  Peter wasted no time in getting to it. In fact, he left in such a hurry that he forgot to say good-by to Old Mother Nature.  But she didn't mind, for she quite understood Peter's feelings, and she laughed when she saw his funny little white tail disappear inside the hollow log.  As for Jumper, he promptly took to his long legs and disappeared with great bounds, Reddy Fox racing after him.    CHAPTER III  More of Peter's Long-Legged Cousins  At sun-up the next morning Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were on hand promptly for their next lesson.  Old Mother Nature smiled as she saw the eager curiosity shining in their eyes.  She didn't wait for them to ask questions.  “Yesterday,” said she, “I told you about your water-loving cousin, the Marsh Rabbit.  You have another relative down there in the Sunny South who is almost as fond of the water.  Some folks call him the Swamp Rabbit.  Others call him the Swamp Hare.  The latter is really the best name for him, because he is a true Hare.  He lives in swamps instead of marshes, but he is a splendid swimmer and fond of the water.  When he is chased by an enemy he makes for the nearest point or stream.”  “How big is he?” asked Jumper.  “Just about your size, Jumper,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “If anything, he is a little bit heavier.  But because his hair lies much smoother than yours, you probably would look a little bit bigger if you were sitting beside him.  As with his cousin, the Marsh Rabbit, the hair on his feet is thin.  His toes are rather long and he can spread them widely, which is a great help in swimming.  He doesn't have to take to the water as his little cousin does, for he is a very good runner.  But he does take to it as the easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him. The Marsh Rabbit and the Swamp Hare are the only members of your family in all the Great World who are fond of the water and who are at home in it.  Now, who shall I tell you about?”  “Our biggest cousins,” cried Peter and Jumper together.  “The ones you told us yesterday are bigger than Jumper,” added Peter.  “It is hard to believe that there can be any much bigger than he.”  Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled.  “It is often hard to believe things you know nothing about,” said she.  “Compared with these other "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],["title","The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#3)"],["body","relatives, Jumper really isn't big at all.  He seems big to you, Peter, but if he should meet his cousin, Snow White the Arctic Hare, who lives way up in the Frozen North, I am quite sure Jumper would feel small.  Snow White looks very much like Jumper in his winter coat, for he is all white save the tips of his ears, which are black.”  “Does he wear a white coat all year round?” asked Peter eagerly.  “When he lives so far north that there is snow and ice for most of the year, he does,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “But when he lives far enough south for the snow to disappear for a little while in the summer, he changes his white coat for one of gray.”  “But how can he live so far north that the snow and ice seldom melt?”  asked Peter, looking very much puzzled.  “What can he find to eat?”  “Even way up there there is moss growing under the snow.  And in the short summer other plants grow.  During the long winter Snow White digs down through the snow to get these.  He also eats the bark and twigs of little stunted trees.  But big as he is, you have a cousin who is still bigger, the biggest of all the family.”  “Who is he?” Jumper and Peter cried together.  “He is called White-tailed Jack,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “And he lives chiefly on the great plains of the Northwest, though sometimes he is found in the mountains and forests.  He is sometimes called the Prairie Hare.  In winter his coat is white, but in summer it is a light brown.  Summer or winter his tail is white, wherein he is much like you, Peter.  It is because of this that he is called White-tailed Jack.”  “Is his tail as short as mine?” asked Peter eagerly.  Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  “No, Peter,” she replied. “It wouldn't be called a long tail by any other animal, but for a member of your family it really is long, and when White-tailed Jack is running he switches it from side to side.  His hind legs are very long and powerful, and he can make a single jump of twenty feet without half trying.  Not even Old Man Coyote can catch him in a straightaway race.  You think Jumper's ears are long, Peter, but they are short compared to the ears of White-tailed Jack.  Not only are his ears long, but they are very big.  When he squats in his form and lays his ears back they reach way over his shoulders. Like the other members of the Hare family he doesn't use holes in the ground or hollow logs.  He trusts to his long legs and to his wonderful speed to escape from his enemies.  Among the latter are Howler the Wolf, Old Man Coyote, Eagles, Hawks and Owls.  He is so big that he would make five or six of you, Peter.”  Peter drew a long breath.  “It is dreadfully hard to believe that I can have a cousin as big as that,” he exclaimed.  “But of course if you say it is so, it is so,” he hastened to add.  “Have I any other cousins anywhere near as big?”  Old Mother Nature nodded.  “There are some others very like White-tailed Jack, only not quite as big,” said she.  “They have just such long hind legs, and just such great ears, but their coats are different, and they live on the great plains farther south.  Some of them live so far south that it is warm all the year round.  One of these latter is Antelope Jack, whose home is in the Southwest.”  “Tell us about him,” begged Peter.  “To begin with,” replied Old Mother Nature, “he is a member of the big Jack Rabbit or Jack Hare branch of your family.  None of this branch should be called a Rabbit.  All the members are first cousins to Jumper and are true Hares.  All have big ears, long, rather thin necks, and long legs.  Even their front legs are comparatively long. Antelope Jack is probably next in size to White-tailed Jack.  Strange to say, although he lives where it is warm for most of the year, his coat is very largely white.  His back is a yellowish-brown and so is his throat.  But his sides are white.  The surprising thing about him is that he has the power of making himself seem almost wholly white.  He can make the white hair spread out at will by means of some special little muscles which I have given him, so that the white of his sides at times almost seems to meet on his back.  When he does this in the sun it makes flashes of white which can be seen a long way.  By means of this Antelope Jack and his friends can keep track of each other when they are a long distance apart.  There is only one other animal who can flash signals in this way, and that is the Antelope of whom I will tell you some other time.  It is because Jack flashes signals in this way that he is called Antelope Jack.  In his habits he is otherwise much like the other members of his family.  He trusts to his long legs and his wonderful powers of jumping to keep him out of danger.  He is not as well known as his commoner cousin, plain Jack Rabbit.  Everybody knows Jack Rabbit.”  Peter shook his head.  “I don't,” said he very meekly.  “Then it is time you did,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “If you had ever been in the Far West you would know him.  Everybody out there knows him.  He isn't quite as big as Antelope Jack but still he is a big fellow.  He wears a brownish coat much like Jumper's, and the tips of his long ears are black.  His tail is longer than Jumper's, and when he runs he carries it down.”  “I don't carry mine down,” Peter piped up.  Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  “True enough, Peter, true enough,” said she.  “You couldn't if you wanted to.  It isn't long enough to carry any way but up.  Jack has more of a tail than you have, just as he has longer legs.  My, how he can run!  He goes with great bounds and about every tenth bound he jumps very high.  This is so that he can get a good look around to watch out for enemies.”  “Who are his enemies?” asked Peter.  “Foxes, Coyotes, Hawks, Eagles, Owls, Weasels, and men,” replied Old Mother Nature.  “In fact, he has about as many enemies as you have.”  “I suppose when you say men, you mean hunters,” said Peter.  Old Mother Nature nodded.  “Yes,” said she, “I mean those who hunt him for fun and those who hunt him to get rid of him.”  Peter pricked up his ears.  “What do they want to get rid of him for.  What harm does he do?” he asked.  “When he lives far away from the homes of men he does no harm,”  replied Old Mother Nature.  “But when he lives near the homes of men he gets into mischief, just as you do when you visit Farmer Brown's garden.”  Old Mother Nature looked very severe when she said this and Peter hung his head.  “I know I ought to keep away from that garden,” said Peter very meekly, “but you have no idea what a temptation it is.  The things in that garden do taste so good.”  Old Mother Nature turned her head to hide the twinkle in her eyes. When she turned toward Peter again her face was severe as before. “That is no excuse, Peter Rabbit,” said she.  “You should be sufficiently strong-minded not to yield to temptation.  Yielding to temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world. It has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit.  Jack just cannot keep away from the crops planted by men.  His family is very large, and when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat, or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and sweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed for becoming angry and seeking to kill them.  Yes, I am sorry to say, Jack Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where he has no business.  Now I guess you have learned sufficient about your long-legged cousins.  I've a great deal to do, so skip along home, both of you.”  “If you please, Mother Nature, may we come again to-morrow?”  asked Peter.  “What for?” demanded Old Mother Nature.  “Haven't you learned enough about your family?”  “Yes,” replied Peter, “but there are lots and lots of things I would like to know about other people.  If you please, I would like to come to school to you every day.  You see, the more I learn about my neighbors, the better able I will be to take care of myself.”  “All right, Mr. Curiosity,” replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly, “come again to-morrow morning.  I wouldn't for the world deny any one who is really seeking for knowledge.”  So Peter and Jumper politely bade her good-by and started for their homes.    CHAPTER IV  Chatterer and Happy Jack Join  Peter Rabbit, on his way to school to Old Mother Nature, was trying to make up his mind about which of his neighbors he would ask.  He had learned so many surprising things about his own family that he shrewdly suspected many equally surprising things were to be learned about his neighbors.  But there were so many neighbors he couldn't decide which one to ask about first.  But that matter was settled for him, and in a funny way.  Hardly had he reached the edge of the Green Forest when he was hailed by a sharp voice.  “Hello, Peter Rabbit!” said this sharp voice.  “Where are you bound at this hour of the morning?  You ought to be heading for home in the dear Old Briar-patch.”  Peter knew that voice the instant he heard it.  It was the voice of Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel.  Happy Jack was seated on the top of an old stump, eating a nut.  “I'm going to school,” replied Peter with a great deal of dignity.  “Going to school!  Ho, ho, ho!  Going to school!” exclaimed Happy Jack.  “Pray tell me to whom you are going to school, and what for?”  “I'm going to school to Old Mother Nature,” retorted Peter.  “I've been going for several days, and so has my cousin, Jumper the Hare. We've learned a lot about our own family and now we are going to learn about the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows.”  “Pooh!” exclaimed Happy Jack.  “Pooh! I know all about my own family, and I guess there isn't much worth knowing about my neighbors that I don't know.”  “Is that so, Mr. Know-it-all,” retorted Peter.  “I don't believe you even know all your own cousins.  I thought I knew all mine, but I found I didn't.”  “What are you fellows talking about?”"]]]
