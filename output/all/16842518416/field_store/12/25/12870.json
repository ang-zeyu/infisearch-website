Opulent Ollie    One Saturday opulent Ollie  Thought he'd go for a ride on the trolley;    But his pennies were few,--    He only had two,--  So he went and made mud-pies with Polly.   [Illustration]      The Two Bears    Prince Curlilocks remarked one day    To Princess Dimplecheek,  \"I haven't had a real good play    For more than 'most a week.\"   Said Princess Dimplecheek, \"My dear,    Your majesty forgets--  This morning we played grenadier    With grandpa's epaulets.   \"And yesterday we sailed to Spain--    We both were pirates bold,  And braved the wild and raging main    To seek for hidden gold.\"   \"True,\" said the prince; \"I mind me well--    Right hardily we fought,  And stormed a massive citadel    To gain the prize we sought.   \"But if your ladyship agrees,    Methinks we'll go upstairs  And build a waste of arctic seas,    And we'll be polar bears.\"   \"Yes, if you'll promise not to bite,\"    Fair Dimplecheek replied,  Already half-way up the flight,    His highness by her side.   \"Princess, on that far window-seat,    Go, sit thee down and wait,  While I ask nursie for a sheet,    Or maybe six or eight.\"   A pile of sheets his highness brought.    \"Dear princess, pray take these;  Although our path with danger's fraught,    We'll reach the polar seas.\"   Two furry rugs his lordship bore,    Two pairs of mittens white;  He threw them on the nursery floor    And shouted with delight.   He spread those sheets--the funny boy--    O'er table, floor, and chair.  \"Princess,\" said he, \"don't you enjoy    This frosty, bracing air?   \"These snowy sheets are fields of ice,    This is an iceberg grim.\"  \"Yes, dear, I think it's very nice,\"    She said, and smiled at him.   And then they donned the rugs of fur,    The mittens, too, they wore;  And Curlilocks remarked to her,    \"Now you must roar and roar.\"   [Illustration]   Dimplecheek looked out from the cowl    Formed by her furry rug.  \"I'm 'fraid of bears that only growl--    I like the kind that hug.\"      The Very Merry Voyage of the Macaroni Man    This figure here before you is a Macaroni Man,  Who is built, as you may notice, on a most ingenious plan.  His skeleton, I beg to state, is made of hairpins three,  Which are bent and curved and twisted to a marvellous degree.  His coat-sleeves and his trouser-legs, his head and eke his waist  Are made of superfine imported macaroni paste.  And if you care to listen, you may hear the thrilling tale  Of the merry Macaroni Man's extraordinary sail.  One sunny day he started for a voyage in his yacht,  His anxious mother called to him, and said, \"You'd better not!  Although the sun is shining bright, I fear that it may rain;  And don't you think, my darling boy, you'd better take the train?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said he, \"no clouds I see,--the sky is blue and clear,  I will return in time for tea--good-by, my mother  dear.\"   [Illustration]   Full merrily he started off, the day was fine and fair,  And to his great delight he found no dampness in the air.  You know if he gets wet, a Macaroni Man is spoiled,  And if he stands too near the steam, of course he may get boiled.  But our hero used precautions,--carefully he shunned the spray,--  And when the steam blew toward him, he just steered the other way.  Now, as the breeze was from the land, his course lay out to sea;  He sailed so far that he felt sure he would be late for tea.  He sailed, and sailed, and sailed, and sailed,--                he feared the dew would fall--  He tried to turn,--but oh, that steam! it would not do at all!   [Illustration]   A single puff blew toward him, and it nearly cooked his face!  The mournful Macaroni Man felt sadly out of place.  But a happy thought occurred to him, \"Ha, ha,--ho, ho!\" said he,--  \"I'll just sail on around the world,--and then, it seems to me,  I'll reach my home (according to a careful estimate)  In time for tea, although I'll be perhaps a trifle late.\"  Then merrily his gallant ship sped o'er the bounding main,  Quickly he crossed the ocean wide, he flew by France and Spain;  Covered the Mediterranean, spanned the Suez Canal,--  \"I'll reach my home to-night,\" he thought, \"oh, yes, I'm sure I shall.\"  He skimmed the Red Sea like a bird,--the Indian Ocean crossed  (But once, in Oceanica, he feared that he was lost).   [Illustration]   He passed Australia on the fly,--cut over Capricorn,  And as the sunset gun he heard, he swung around Cape Horn.  Still at full speed, he sailed due north, he rounded Cape St. Roque,  Crossed the equator, and found out the Gulf Stream was no joke.  He coasted by the seaboard States. Hurrah! all danger past,  Quickly he sailed the last few miles and reached his home at last;  His mother welcomed him, and said, \"I'm glad there was no shower;  But hurry in, my bonny boy, I've waited tea an hour.\"   [Illustration]      The 4.04 Train    \"There's a train at 4.04,\" said Miss Jenny;  \"Four tickets I'll take. Have you any?\"      Said the man at the door:      \"Not four for 4.04,  For four for 4.04 is too many.\"      [Illustration]   A Valuable Gift    Old Father Time, one day  In his study, so they say,    Was indulging in a surreptitious nap,  When from his drowsy dreams  He was wakened, as it seems,    By a timid but persistent little rap.   He yawned and rubbed his eyes  In indolent surprise,    Then slowly he arose from where he sat;  He opened wide his door,  And nearly tumbled o'er    The figure that stood waiting on the mat.   A tiny little dog,  With excitement all agog,    And angry eyes that seemed to flash and glower.  His manner was polite,  But he said, \"I claim my right!    And I've called, sir, to demand of you my hour.\"   \"Your what?\" the old man said,  As he shook his puzzled head;    And the pertinacious puppy spoke with force:  \"Well, sir, they often say,  'Every dog must have his day,'    So a puppy ought to have an hour, of course!\"   [Illustration]   The old man shook with glee,  But he said obligingly,    \"The dog days are all gone, I grieve to say;  But since you've come so far,  And so mannerly you are,    I'll give you just an hour--to get away.\"      [Illustration]   The Grandiloquent Goat    A very grandiloquent Goat  Sat down to a gay table d'h√¥te;    He ate all the corks,    The knives and the forks,  Remarking: \"On these things I dote.\"   Then, before his repast he began,  While pausing the menu to scan,    He said: \"Corn, if you please,    And tomatoes and pease,  I'd like to have served in the can.\"      How the Cat was Belled    A fable told by La Fontaine,    Two centuries or more ago,  Describes some rats who would arraign    A cat, their direst foe,  Who killed so many rats    And caused the deepest woe,  This Catiline of cats.   The poor rats were at their wits' end  Their homes and families to defend;    And as a last resort    They took the case to court.   It seems they called a caucus wise  Of rats of every age and size,    And then their dean,    With sapient mien,  A very Solon of a rat,  Said it was best to bell the cat.   The quaint old tale goes on to tell  How this plan would have worked quite well,    But, somehow, flaws    Appeared, because  No one would hang the bell.   Though there the ancient fable ends,  Later report the tale extends,    No longer is the truth withheld;      Developments appear,      And so you have it here.        For the first time        Set down in rhyme    Just how that cat was belled.   The council, as 'twas getting late,  Was just about to separate,    When suddenly a rat arose    Who said he could a plan propose      Which would, he thought, succeed      And meet their urgent need.   Now as this rat was very small,  And had no dignity at all,    Although his plan was well advised,    We really need not be surprised  That all the rats of riper years  Expressed the gravest doubts and fears;      Till suddenly      He said, said he,  \"If you will leave it all to me,        I will avow        Three days from now  That you shall all be free.\"  The solemn council then adjourned.  Each rat to home and fireside turned;    But each shook his wise head    And to his neighbor said:  \"It is a dangerous job, in truth,  Though it seems naught to headstrong youth.\"   Now young Sir Rat we next behold,  With manner brave and visage bold,      Go marching down      To London town,  Where wondrous things are sold.      We see him stop      At a large shop,  And with the bland clerk's courteous aid  This was the purchase that he made:  A bicycle of finest make,  With modern gear and patent brake,  Pedometer, pneumatic tire,  And spokes that looked like silver wire,      A lantern bright      To shine at night,  Enamel finish, nickel plate,  And all improvements up to date.  Said sly Sir Rat: \"It suits me well,  Especially that sweet-toned _bell_.\"   [Illustration]   The shades of night were falling fast  When Sir Rat turned toward home at last.  The neighbors watched him as he passed  And said: \"What is that queer-shaped thing?  Surely that can't be made to ring.\"    Sir Rat went on, nor stayed    To hear the jests they made;  And just outside the old cat's gate  He stopped and boldly braved his fate,    For if that cat    Should smell a rat  How quickly he'd come out and catch him,  And with what gusto he'd despatch him!  Sir Rat, against the picket-fence  Leaned the machine, then hurried hence,    And hid himself with glee,    And waited breathlessly      To see what that      Cantankerous cat  Would say, when in the twilight dim  He saw that brightly shining rim.     Sir Rat, though hidden quite,    And safely out of sight,  Had scarcely time to wink his eye,  When Mr. Cat came sauntering by.       \"Ha! Ha!\" said he,      \"What's this I see,  A bicycle! and just my size!  Well, this, indeed, is a surprise!      I'll confiscate      This treasure great;  How quickly I'll fly o'er the ground  When I pursue my hunting round!\"   He mounted "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24560"],["title","The Jingle Book (#2)"],["body","with eager haste,  It suited well his sporting taste;    He guided it at will,    And used the brake with skill,  He grasped the handle-bars, and then--  You see it was his custom when  He did a thing, to do it well--  Of course he used the clear-toned bell!   [Illustration]   Victory now! the deed is done!  No longer at the set of sun  The rats fly shrieking to their nests,  They saunter round with merry jests    And ne'er a thought of fear,      Knowing full well      They'll hear the bell    When Mr. Cat draws near.   [Illustration]   And young Sir Rat who did the deed,  Whose cleverness relieved their need,    His wondrous enterprise    Was lauded to the skies.  And everywhere his name  Was hailed with shouts of fame.   In difficulties, oft we see  Modern improvements frequently  Will prove a happy remedy.      The Rhyme of Triangular Tommy    [Illustration]   Triangular Tommy, one morning in May,  Went out for a walk on the public highway.      Just here I will say,      'Twas a bright sunny day,  And the sky it was blue, and the grass it was green,  The same sky and grass that you've all of you seen;  And the birds in the trees sang their usual song,  And Triangular Tommy went trudging along.       But I can tell you      He cared naught for the view.  He did just what small boys of his age always do:      He shouted out \"Scat!\"      At a wandering cat,  And he picked a big daisy to stick in his hat;      The clovers he topped,      And the toadstools he cropped,  And sometimes he scuffled and sometimes he hopped.   [Illustration]   He took an old stick and poked at a worm,  And merrily chuckled to see the thing squirm;  When he chanced to look up, and in gorgeous array  Triangular Tilly was coming his way.  Triangular Tom straightened up in a jiff,  And put on his best manner--exceedingly stiff;  And as far as his angular shape would allow  Triangular Tom made a beautiful bow.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   Triangular Tilly went smilingly by,  With a glance that was friendly, but just a bit shy.  And Tom so admired her that after she passed,  A backward look over his shoulder he cast.  And he said, \"Though I think many girls are but silly,  I really admire that Triangular Tilly.\"   [Illustration]   But soon all such thoughts were put out of his head,  For who should come by but Triangular Ted,  The very boy Tom had been wishing to see!  \"Hello!\" said Triangular Tommy, said he.  \"Hello!\" said Triangular Ted, and away  Those two children scooted to frolic and play.      And they had, on the green,      Where 'twas all dry and clean,  The best game of leap-frog that ever was seen.  Triangular Tom beat down this way, you know,  And Triangular Ted stood beside him, just so,      When one, two, three--go!      With  the  greatest gusto,  Ted flew over Tom in a manner not slow.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]   They played hide-and-seek, they played marbles and tag,  They played they were soldiers, and each waved a flag;      Till at last they confessed,      They wanted to rest;  So they sat down and chatted with laughter and jest;   [Illustration]   When Schoolmaster Jones they suddenly spied,  Come clumping along with his pedagogue stride,  As usual, with manner quite preoccupied;      With his hat on one side,      And his shoe-lace untied--  A surly old fellow, it can't be denied;      And each wicked boy      Thought that he would enjoy  An occasion the thoughtful old man to annoy,  And all of his wise calculations destroy.      So they thought they'd employ      A means known to each boy.  And across the wide pavement they fastened a twine  Exceedingly strong but exceedingly fine;  And Triangular Tommy laughed out in his glee,  To think how upset the old master would be!   [Illustration]   Although very wicked, their mischievous scheme  Was a perfect success; and with a loud scream,      A horrible clash,      A thump and a smash,  Old Schoolmaster Jones came down with a crash.  His hat rolled away, and his spectacles broke,  And those dreadful boys thought it a howling good joke.  And they just doubled up in immoderate glee,  Saying, \"Look at the Schoolmaster!      Tee-hee! tee-hee!\"   [Illustration]   [Illustration]       Tom gave a guffaw,      And Ted roared a \"haw-haw\";  But soon their diversion was turned into awe,  For old Schoolmaster Jones was angry, they saw.   [Illustration]   [Illustration]       Triangular Ted      Turned swiftly and fled,  And far down the street like a reindeer he sped,  Leaving Tommy to face the old gentleman's rage,  Who quickly jumped up,--he was brisk for his age,--  And with just indignation portrayed on his face,  To Triangular Tommy he quickly gave chase.   [Illustration]       And hearing his squeals      And his frantic appeals,  Triangular Tommy fast took to his heels.  Now Tommy was agile and Tommy was spry;  He whizzed through the air--he just seemed to fly;  He rushed madly on, until, dreadful to say!  He came where the railroad was just in his way--      And alas! and alack!      He tripped on the track  And then with a terrible, sudden ker-thwack!  Triangular Tommy sprawled flat on his back--  And the train came along with a crash, and a crack,  A din, and a clatter, a clang, and a clack,  A toot, and a boom, and a roar, and a hiss,  And chopped him up all into pieces like this--  If _you_ cut out papers just like them, why, then,  If you try, you can put him together again.   [Illustration]      A Modern Invention    Old Santa Claus is up-to-date,    And hereafter, rumors say,  He'll come with his pack of glittering toys,  And visit the homes of girls and boys,    In a new reindeerless sleigh.   [Illustration]      An April Joke    [Illustration]   Oh, it was a merry, gladsome day,  When the April Fool met the Queen of May;  She had roguish eyes and golden hair,  And they were a mischief-making pair.  They planned the funniest kind of a joke  On the poor, long-suffering mortal folk;  And a few mysterious words he said,  His fool's cap close to her flower-crowned head.  Then he laughed till he made his cap-bells ring,  At the thought of the topsy-turvy Spring.  \"'Tis a fair exchange,\" he said, with a wink--  \"It is!\" she said, and what do you think?  The flowers that should bloom in the month of May  Every one of them came on an April day!  And they looked for April showers in vain,  But all through May it did nothing but rain!

[Illustration]   Y is the Youth Father William surveyed.   [Illustration]   Z is the Zigzag the mouse's tail made.      The Funny Kittens    [Illustration]   Once there were some silly kittens,  And they knitted woolly mittens    To bestow upon the freezing Hottentots.  But the Hottentots refused them,  Saying that they never used them    Unless crocheted of red with yellow spots.   [Illustration]   So the silly little kittens  Took their blue and white striped mittens    To a Bear who lived within a hollow tree;  The Bear responded sadly,  \"I would wear your mittens gladly,    But I fear they are too gay for such as me.\"   [Illustration]   Then the kittens, almost weeping,  Came to where a Cow lay sleeping,    And they woke her with this piteous request,  \"Won't you wear our mittens furry?\"  Said the Cow, \"My dears, don't worry;    I will put them on as soon as I am dressed.\"   [Illustration]   Then the Cow put on her bonnet  With a wreath of roses on it,    And a beautiful mantilla fringed with white;  And she donned the pretty mittens,  While the silly little kittens    Clapped their paws in admiration at the sight.      The Strike of the Fireworks    'Twas the night before the Fourth of July, the people slept serene;  The fireworks were stored in the old town hall that stood                on the village green.  The steeple clock tolled the midnight hour, and at its final stroke,  The fire in the queer old-fashioned stove lifted its voice and spoke;  \"The earth and air have naught to do, the water, too, may play,  And only fire is made to work on Independence Day.   \"I won't stand such injustice! It's wrong, beyond a doubt,  And I shall take my holiday. Good-by, I'm going out!\"  Up spoke a Roman candle then, \"The principle is right!  Suppose we strike, and all agree we will not work to-night!\"  \"My stars!\" said a small sky-rocket. \"What an awful time there'll be,  When the whole town comes together to-night, the great display to see!\"  \"Let them come,\" said a saucy pinwheel, \"yes, let them come if they like,  As a delegate I'll announce to them that the fireworks                are going to strike!\"  \"My friends,\" said a small"]]]
