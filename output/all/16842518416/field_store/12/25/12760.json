Listen, I'll check with Internal Revenue on that money. But have you got a list of the kids' addresses?\"  \"I can get one,\" Lynch said, and went to the door.  It closed behind him. Malone sat waiting alone for a few minutes, and then Lynch came back. \"List'll be here in a minute,\" he said. He sat down behind his desk and reached for the notebook again. When he turned to the third page his expression changed to one of surprise.  \"Be damned,\" said. \"There does seem to be a connection, doesn't there?\" He held up the picture of the red Cadillac for Malone to see.  \"Sure does,\" Malone said. \"That's why I want those addresses. If there is a connection, I sure want to find out about it.\"  Ten minutes later, Malone was walking out of the precinct station with the list of addresses in his pocket. He was heading for his Great Adventure, but he didn't know it. All he was thinking about was the red Cadillacs, and the eight teen-agers. \"I'm going to get to the bottom of this if it takes me all summer,\" he said, muttering to himself.  \"That's the spirit,\" he told himself. \"Never say die.\"  Then, realizing he had just said it, he frowned. Perhaps it hadn't really counted. But, then again....         *       *       *       *       *  He was on his way down the steps when he hit the girl.  The mutual collision was not catastrophic. On the other hand, it was not exactly minor. It fell somewhere between the two, as an unclassifiable phenomenon of undoubted potency. Malone said: \"Oog,\" with some fervor as the girl collided with his chest and rebounded like a handball striking a wall. Something was happening to her, but Malone had no time to spare to notice just what. He was falling through space, touching a concrete step once in a while, but not long enough to make any real acquaintance with it. It seemed to take him a long time to touch bottom, and when he had, he wondered if _touch_ was quite the word.  _Bottom_ certainly was. He had fallen backward and landed directly on his _glutei maximi_, obeying the law regarding equal and opposite reaction and several other laws involving falling bodies.  His first thought was that he was now neatly balanced. His tail had received the same treatment as his head. He wondered if a person could get concussion of the tail bones, and had reached no definite conclusion when, unexpectedly, his eyes focused again.  He was looking at a girl. That was all he saw at first. She had apparently fallen just as he had, bounced once and sat down rather hard. She was now lying flat on her back, making a sound like \"_rrr_\" between her teeth.  Malone discovered that he was sitting undignifiedly on the steps. He opened his mouth to say something objectionable, took another look at the girl, and shut it with a snap. This was no ordinary girl.  He smiled at her. She shook her head and sat up, still going \"_rrr_.\" Then she stopped and said, instead: \"What do you think--\"  \"I'm sorry,\" Malone said in what he hoped was a charming, debonair and apologetic voice. It was quite a lot to get into one voice, but he tried his very hardest. \"I just didn't see--\"  [Illustration]  \"You didn't?\" the girl said. \"If you didn't, you must be completely blind.\"  Malone noticed with hope that there was no anger in her voice. The last thing in the world he wanted was to get this girl angry at him.  \"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"I'm not blind. Not blind at all.\" He smiled at her and stood up. His face was beginning to get a little tired, but he retained the smile as he went over to her, extended a hand and pulled her to her feet.  She was something special. Her hair was long and dark, and fell in soft waves to her shoulders. The shoulders were something all by themselves, but Malone postponed consideration of them for a minute to take a look at her face.  It was heart-shaped and rather thin. She had large brown liquid eyes that could look, Malone imagined, appealing, loving, worshiping--or, like a minute ago, downright furious. Below these features, she had a straight lovely nose and a pair of lips which Malone immediately classified as Kissable.  Her figure, including the shoulders, was on the slim side, but she was very definitely all there. Malone could not think of any parts the Creator had left out, and if there were any he didn't want to hear about them. In an instant, Malone knew that he had met the only great love of his life.  Again.  His mind was whirling and for a second he didn't know what to do. And then he remembered the Queen's Own FBI. Phrases flowered forth in his mind as if it were a garden packed corner to corner with the most exquisite varieties of blooming idiots.  \"My deepest apologies, my dear,\" Sir Kenneth Malone said gallantly, even managing a small display bow for the occasion. \"May I be of any assistance?\"  The girl smiled up at him as she came to her feet. The smile was radiant and beautiful and almost loving. Malone felt as if he couldn't stand it. Tingles of the most wonderful kind ran through him, reached his toes and then ran back the other way, meeting a whole new set going forward.  \"You're very nice,\" the girl said, and the tingles became positive waves of sensation. \"Actually, it was all my fault. Please don't apologize, Mr.--\" She paused, expectantly.  \"Me?\" Malone said, his gallantry deserting him for the second. But it returned full force before he expected it. \"I'm Malone,\" he said. \"Kenneth Joseph Malone.\" He had always liked the middle name he had inherited from his father, but he never had much opportunity to use it. He made the most of it now, rolling it out with all sorts of subsidiary flourishes. As a matter of fact, he barely restrained himself from putting a \"Sir\" before his name.  The girl's brown eyes widened just a trifle. Malone felt as if he could have fallen into them and drowned. \"Oh, my,\" she said. \"You must be a detective.\" And then, like the merest afterthought: \"My name's Dorothy.\"  _Dorothy._ It was a beautiful name. It made Malone feel all choked up, inside. He blinked at the girl and tried to look manly and wonderful. It was an effort, but he nearly carried it off.         *       *       *       *       *  After a second or two he realized that she had asked him a question. He didn't want to disillusion her in any way, and, after all, an FBI agent was a kind of detective, but he thought it was only fair that she should know the whole truth about him right from the start.  \"Not exactly a detective,\" he said.  \"Not exactly?\" she said, looking puzzled. She looked positively glorious when puzzled, Malone decided at once.  \"That is,\" he said carefully, \"I do detect, but not for the city of New York.\"  \"Oh,\" she said. \"A private eye. Is that right?\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"no.\"  She looked even more puzzled. Malone hastened to explain before he got to the point where conversation was impossible.  \"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" he said. After a second he thought of a clarification and added: \"FBI.\"  \"Oh,\" the girl said. \"_Oh._\"  \"But you can call me Ken,\" Malone said.  \"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"And you call me Dorothy.\"  \"Sure,\" he said. He tried it out. \"Dorothy.\" It felt swell.  \"Well--\" she said after a second.  \"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Were you looking for a detective? Because if I can help in any way--\"  \"Not exactly,\" Dorothy said. \"Just a little routine business. I'll go on in and--\"  Malone suddenly found himself talking without having any idea why he'd started, or what he was going to say. At first he said: \"_Urr_,\" as if the machine were warming up, and this stopped Dorothy and caused her to give him a rather sharp, baffled stare. Then he found some words and used them hurriedly, before they got away.  \"Dorothy,\" he said, \"would you like to take in a show this evening? I think I can get tickets to ... well, I guess I could get tickets to almost anything, if I really tried.\" His expression attempted to leave no doubt that he would really try.  Dorothy appeared to consider for a moment. \"Well,\" she said at last, \"how about 'The Hot Seat'?\"  Malone felt just the way he had several years before when he had bluffed his way into a gigantic pot during a Washington poker game, with only a pair of fours to work with. At the last moment, his bluff had been called.  It had, he realized, been called again. \"The Hot Seat\" had set some sort of record, not only for Broadway longevity, but for audience frenzy. Getting tickets for it was about the same kind of proposition as buying grass on the Moon, and getting them with absolutely no prior notice would require all the wire-pulling Malone could manage. He thought about \"The Hot Seat\" and wished Dorothy had picked something easy, like arranging for her to meet the Senate.  But he swallowed bravely. \"I'll do my best,\" he said. \"Got any second choice?\"  \"Sure,\" she said, and laughed. \"Pick any one you want. I haven't seen them all, and the ones I have seen are worth seeing again.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said.  \"I really didn't expect you to get tickets for 'The Hot Seat,'\" she said.  \"Nothing,\" Malone said, \"is impossible.\" He grinned at her. \"Meanwhile, where can I pick you up? Your home?\"  Dorothy frowned and shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"You see, I'm living with an aunt, and I ... well, never mind.\" She thought for a minute. \"I know,\" she said. \"Topp's.\"  \"What?\" Malone said.  \"Topp's,\" Dorothy said. \"On Forty-second Street, just East of Broadway? It's a restaurant.\"  \"I don't exactly know where it is,\" Malone said, \"but if it's there, I'll find it.\" He looked gallant and determined. \"We can get something to eat there before the show--whatever the show turns out to be.\"  \"Fine,\" Dorothy said.  \"How about making it at six?\" Malone said.  She nodded. \"Six it is,\" she said. \"Now bye-bye.\" She touched her forefinger to her lips, and brushed Malone's cheek with the kissed finger.  By the time the new set of tingles had begun to evaporate, she had gone into the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24449"],["title","Queen Summer; Or, The Tourney of the Lily and the Rose (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Notes:   1) Each verse is contained within a full-page      illustration, so the illustration tags within      the text have been removed to avoid congestion.   2) Spelling and inconsistent formatting have been      left as printed.          *       *       *       *       *                    [Illustration]                    Queen Summer                        or                   The Tourney                     of the                      Lily                        &                    the Rose                   Walter Crane                    Cassell & Co                      Ld:          *       *       *       *       *                    Queen Summer                 or the Tourney             of the Lily & the Rose               penned & portrayed                by Walter Crane     Cassell & Co: Ld: London: Paris: & Melbourne          *       *       *       *       *                    [Illustration]          *       *       *       *       *     When Summer on the earth was queen   She held her court in gardens green   Fair hung with tapestry of leaves,   Where threads of gold the sun enweaves   With checquered patterns on the floor   Of velvet lawns the scythe smoothes o'er:   Their waving fans the soft winds spread   Each way to cool Queen Summer's head:   The woodland dove made music soft,   And Eros touched his lute full oft.     Round Time's dial thronged the hours,     Masking in the Masque of Flowers     Like knights and ladies fair be-dight     In silk attire, both red and white.     And as the winds about them played,     And shook the flowers or disarrayed,     A whispered word among them goes     Of how the Lily flouts the Rose,     Suitors for Summer's favor dear,     To win the crown of all the year--   And how each champion brave would fight,     Queen Summer to decide the right.     Then shrill the wind-winged heralds blew;   The lists were set in Summer's view,     With blazoned shields, & pennons spruce   Of fluttering flag & fleur-de-luce:     And spread with 'broidered hangings gay,   Till all was ready for the fray.     Between their banners white and red,     Of Rose and Lily overhead,       Queen Summer took her judgment seat,   Whom all the crowd of flowers did greet.     The silver arum-trumpet's sound   With tongues of gold, & to the ground   The shining champions each did ride,   Their party-colours flaunting wide.     Came first the glowing Rose in view,   With crimson pennon fluttering new;   With glittering spines all armed he came,   With lance and shield--a rose aflame;   With tossing crest and mantling free,   On fiery steed,--a sight to see!     Nor long the Lily knight delayed;   In silver armour white arrayed,   He flashed like light upon the scene,   A lamp amid the garden green.   Milk-white his horse, & housings fair   With silver lilies shining there.     The summer winds the onset blew:   With level lance each champion flew,     And clashed together, mid a snow     Of petals on the grass below.     Pressed eager then the gazing rows:   Some cried, \"the Lily\", some, \"the Rose\"   But while the fate of battle hung,   Again the silver trumpets sung;     And, sudden charging from each side,     Of Roses and of Lilies ride   A host to still maintain the strife     For roses or for lilies' life     Rose favoured knights of maidens true,   Their pennons blushing with each hue   Of Rose-craft, since from wild thorn frail   Their order grew--through dark & pale   Of maiden-bloom to damask deep,   Or Gloire-de-Dijon that doth keep   Enfolded fire within his breast,   Still golden hearted like the rest.     Like a cloud of morn they bore,   Or rosy wave on grassy shore,   That, breaking, dashed the silver spray   Thay met--the Lily-lances play;   In crested legends on that came   Against them--snow & burning flame   Mixing with the crimson flood   Of roses & their fragrant blood,     Whereof the grass undue was rife,   As surged & rolled the floral strife,   With checquered fortune o'er the green,   Until at last up-rose the Queen:     And caused the zephyr horns to blow   A truce, the victor's crown to show.   But like a garland on the ground   Of roses & of lilies found,   So linked & locked in strife they lay   Each silver stem & clinging spray,     The doughty champions could not rise   Before the Queen to claim her prize.   So to the field of battle down   She stepped, with rose & lily crown   Of silver & of gold fair wrought;   And thus Queen Summer spake her thought:     And to each warrior thus did say:   Read in the fortune of your fray   Fit emblem sweet of unity,   Nor Rose nor Lily plant on high,   But side by side in equal right,   And pleasant cheer the Red & White:     That men & maids be glad to see,   Always in pleasant company,     Life & Love close linked together,   And strong to bear times' wintry weather     Love not consumed in passion's heart   But golden flamed & stedfast, sweet:     Time's snows shall quench not, though they hide:   Each spring renews the rosy tide:     Each lover in his lady's face   Sees roses blent with lilies' grace:     The poet & the painter praise   This heraldry of summer days;     And every garden sweet that blows   Doth set the Lily by the Rose.     Peace, then in all my borders be,   Beneath the silvern olive tree.\"     Each rose, each lily's head bent low,   And each one sought his fallen foe:     And careful hands the wounded bore,   With balm and honey to restore:     And trimmed the grass & decked each seat,   And made all fit for dancer's feet;     Beneath the summer full-orbed moon,   Ruddy & gold that rose full soon,   Like rose & lily fused in fire,   Ere the sunset's torch expire.     Then forth each knightly lily led   A blushing rosy dame so red;     Nor lily hands or hearts denied   The rose-hued warriors erst defied.     Light-footed through the dance's maze,   Quick they moved like wingéd fays;   As measured music soft did swell,   And echoed deep from bosky dell,   Till, from the leafy forest side,   The sweet-tongued nightingale replied,   Dissolved in streams of silver sound,   Merged in the moonlight, lost & found;   Like the dancers, till in shade,   Of Summer's verdant night they fade.          *       *       *       *       *                   [Illustration]                 Cassell & Co: Lm:"]]]
