But, bless God, in his goodness      and mercy he recalls my wandering steps, and invites me to dwell in      safety under the shadow of his wing.       _Oct. 11th._--No graces are of more importance than patience and      perseverance. They give consistency and dignity to character. We      may possess the most sparkling talents and the most interesting      qualities, but without these graces, the former lose their lustre,      and the latter their charms. In religion their influence is more      important, as they form the character, by enabling us to surmount      difficulties and remove obstacles. I am far from thinking them      constitutional virtues, with a little additional cultivation, but I      consider them the gift of heaven, less common than is generally      imagined, though sometimes faintly counterfeited. They differ from      natural or moral excellence in this being the proper and consistent      exercise of those virtues.       _Oct. 12th._--It is two weeks to-day since I first wrote home. A      week ago I received a kind letter from my brother George, but was      too ill with fever to read it, or to write in reply until to-day. I      said: \"I feel truly thankful to you for the tender concern and warm      interest which you express in your letter. Tell my dear Mother that      I share with her her afflictions, and that I am daily more forcibly      convinced that every earthly comfort and advantage is transient and      unsatisfactory, that this is not our home, but that our highest      happiness amidst these fluctuating scenes, is to insure the favour      and protection of him who alone can raise us above afflictions and      calamities.\"       _November 20th._--More than a month has elapsed since I recorded my      religious feelings and enjoyments on paper. During this period, I      have sometimes realized all the pleasures of health; at other      times, borne down with pain and sickness, the spirit would be cast      down. At such seasons of depression, religion would come in as my      only comfort, and with the Psalmist I would exclaim, \"Hope thou in      God, for I shall yet praise him who is the light of my countenance,      and my God.\" Thus I find from blessed experience, that in every      state and condition, union and intercourse with God brings true      peace, joy, trust, and praise. If there be any honour, here it is.      If there be any wealth, this is it. \"I would rather be a      door-keeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of      wickedness.\" O Lord, give me more of the mind of Christ!       _Nov. 25th._--In entering on the field of life, I find my mind much      perplexed with the variety of objects presented to my view. The      comforts and tranquility of domestic happiness attract my      attention, and excite warm desires in my heart. Am I not to taste      the pleasures which two hearts reciprocally united in one, mutually      communicate? or must I give up the home of domestic enjoyment to      the calls of duty, and the salvation of men? Has heaven designed      that I should spend my days in seeking the lost sheep of the House      of Israel? May divine wisdom direct me, and suffer me not to follow      the dictates of my own will!       _Nov. 26th._--By taking a retrospective view of what is past, we      learn to ask more wisely in the time to come. The cool dictates of      reason, assisted by that inward monitor, conscience, placed within      the breast of every individual, strongly condemns every deviation      from propriety, justice, or morality. By mingling with society we      learn human nature, and the scenes of public resort afford us a      field for useful observation, yet retirement is the place to      acquire the most important knowledge--_the knowledge of ourselves_.      What would it avail us to dive into the mysteries of science, or      entertain the world with new discoveries, to acquaint ourselves      with the principles of morality, or learn the whole catalogue of      Christian doctrines, if we are unacquainted with our own hearts,      and strangers to the business of self-government?       _February 12th, 1825._--During the long period since I last penned      my religious meditations, my feelings, hopes, and prospects have      been extremely varied. While I was promising myself health and many      temporal pleasures, God saw fit to show me the uncertainty of      earthly things, and the necessity and wisdom of submission to his      will, by the rod of affliction. During my sickness I have derived      much pleasure and profit from the visits of pious friends, so that      I have felt it is good to be afflicted.[4]       _Feb. 13th._--I am resolved, by God's assisting grace, to keep the      following resolutions:--(1) Endeavour to fix my first waking      thoughts on God; (2) By rising early to attend to my devotions, and      reading the Scriptures; (3)By praying oftener each day, and      maintaining a more devotional frame of mind; (4) By being more      circumspect in my conduct and conversation; (5) By improving my      time more diligently in reading useful books, and study; (6) By      watching over my thoughts, and keeping my desires within proper      bounds; (7) By examining myself more closely by the scripture rule;      (8) By leaving myself and all that concerns me to God's disposal;      (9) By reviewing every evening the actions of the day, and      especially every Sabbath, examining wherein I have come short, or      have kept God's precepts.       _Feb. 16th._--I have lately been closely employed in reading Bishop      Burnet's History of the Reformation. How sad to reflect on the      cruelties that were then practised against the professors of true      religion! What a reason for thankfulness that the sway of papal      authority can no longer inflict papal obligations on the      consciences of men! But after careful research into this highly      authentic history, I find but few vestiges of that apostolic purity      which churchmen so boastfully attribute to that memorable period of      Christian history. Great allowance, is, however, to be made when      we consider that they were just emerging out of the superstitions      of popery. That doctrines, discipline, and ceremonies, cannot be      established without the royal assent, even when they are approved      both by ecclesiastical and legislative authority, is a practice so      different from anything that the Primitive Church authorizes, it      seems to me to originate from quite a different source; that a      whole nation should be bound in their religious opinions by a      single individual, savours so much of popery, I think it may      properly be called its offspring. Pretentions to regal supremacy in      church affairs were never made till a late period, although this      interference of papal authority in matters entirely spiritual, does      not annul any ecclesiastical power, or prove its doctrines to be      corrupt, or its ordinations illegal. It may be justly ranked among      the invasions of modern corruption.       _Feb. 17th._--Since I drew up, four days since, several resolutions      for amendment, I bless God I have reason to believe I have made      some improvement. I have applied myself more closely to study,      prayed oftener, and governed my thoughts with more rigour.       _Feb. 27th._--I am now emerging into life, surrounded by blessings      and opportunities for usefulness and improvement; but, alas! where      is my gratitude, my love to God, my zeal for his cause, and for the      salvation of those who are ignorant of the great truths of the      Gospel? If, O God, thou hast designed this awfully important work      for me, qualify me for it; increase and enlarge my desires for the      salvation of immortal souls!       _March 15th._--This day I have recommenced my studies with Mr. John      Law, at Hamilton. How necessary that I should be very careful in my      conduct for the credit of religion and Methodism!       _March 24th._--I have this day finished twenty-two years of my      life. I have decided this day to travel in the Methodist Connexion      and preach Jesus to the lost sons of men. Oh, the awful importance      of this work! How utterly unfit I am for the undertaking! How      little wisdom, experience, and, above all, grace do I possess for      the labours of the ministry! Blessed Jesus, fountain of wisdom, God      of power, I give myself to thee, and to the Church, to do with me      according to thy will. Instruct and sanctify me, that whether I      live, it may be to the Lord, and when I die it may be to the Lord!       _April 3rd.--Easter Sunday._--I this day commenced my ministerial      labours. Bless the Lord, he has given me a heart to feel. He hears      my prayer. Oh, my soul, hang all thy hopes upon the Lord! Forbid I      should seek the praise of men, but may I seek their good and God's      glory.       In the morning I endeavoured to speak from Ps. cxxvi. 5, and in the      evening from Acts ii. 24--a subject suitable for the day; bless the      Lord, I felt something of the power of my Saviour's resurrection      resting on my soul.       _April 8th._--The Lord being my helper, my little knowledge and      feeble talents shall be unreservedly devoted to his service. I do      not yet regret giving up my worldly pursuits for the welfare of      souls. I want Christ to be all in all.       _April 10th.--Sabbath._--I endeavoured this morning to show the      abundant provisions, the efficacy, and the triumphs of the Gospel      from Isaiah xxv. 6, 7, 8, and in the afternoon I described the      righteous man and his end from Prov. xiv. 32. I felt much of the      presence of the Lord, and I do bless the Lord he has converted one      soul in this place to-day.

DEER MOUSE IS TIMID            109     THE TALE OF BENNY BADGER     THE TALE OF BENNY BADGER     I  A GREAT DIGGER   Of course, Benny Badger had the best of reasons for living on the high, dry plains. There he had for neighbors plenty of ground squirrels and prairie dogs. And it is likely that he enjoyed their company much more than they did his.  If anyone had asked them, those little wild people would no doubt have confessed that they wished Benny Badger was somewhere else. But their wishes meant nothing to Benny--if he knew anything of them. Although he couldn't help noticing that his small neighbors hurried into their homes whenever they caught sight of him, Benny never took the hint and went away. On the contrary, when he spied a prairie dog or a ground squirrel disappearing into his burrow Benny was more than ready to go right in after him.  Now, the tunnels that led to the houses of those smaller folk were too small to admit anybody as bulky as Benny Badger. But that difficulty never hindered Benny. Digging was the easiest thing he did. He had a powerful body, short, stout legs, and big feet, which bore long, strong claws. And when he started to dig his way into somebody else's home he certainly did make the dirt fly.  He was so fond of digging that he even dug countless holes of his own, just for the fun it gave him--so far as anybody could find out. And if he had only left other folk's holes alone some of his neighbors would not have objected to his favorite sport. For more than one fox and coyote had been known to make his home in a hole dug by Benny Badger. And, though they never took the trouble to thank him for saving them work, they often chuckled about his odd way of having fun, and remarked among themselves that Benny must be a stupid fellow.  If they really thought that, they made a great mistake. To be sure, at anything except digging he was slow and awkward. He was too heavy and squat to be spry on his feet--to chase and catch his more nimble neighbors. But no one that knew much about Benny Badger would have said that his wits were dull. They were sharp. And so, too, were his teeth, which he never hesitated to use in a fight.  Left alone, Benny Badger--when he wasn't too hungry--was a peaceable person. But if a dog ever tried to worry him Benny had a most unpleasant way of seizing his annoyer with his powerful jaws and holding the poor creature as if he never intended to let him go.  Cornered, Benny knew no such thing as fear. He had the heart of a lion, and jaws like a steel trap. And no wise dog ever let Benny get a good, firm grip on him.  Usually no one saw Benny Badger except at night. He seldom left his den in the daytime except to sun himself. And even then not many noticed him. Though he did not hide when anyone surprised him while taking a sun-bath, he had a trick of lying flat in the grass without moving. And it took a sharp eye to spy him when he lay low in that fashion.  Curled up asleep, with his long fur on end, he looked too comfortable to disturb. At least, that was what the ground squirrels thought. And if one of those busy little fellows ever paused to stare curiously at Benny when he was having a nap in the warm sunshine, Benny Badger had only to awake and turn his head toward the onlooker to make him scamper for home as fast as he could go.  It was not Benny's face, either, that frightened the ground squirrels away, though everybody had to admit that he had a queer one. A black patch spread over his eyes and ran like the point of a V down his nose. For the most part, however, he was of a grayish color, with still more black running in streaks across his back. Underneath he was a--yes! a dirty white color. But then, one must remember that he was forever digging in the dirt; and there was very little water where he lived. Anyhow, he was particular enough about one thing: his long hair was always carefully parted in the middle from his head to his tail.  And certainly that ought to show that he tried to keep himself looking neat.     II  HUNTING FOR SOMETHING   It was a pleasant summer's night. Anyone would have supposed that it was just the sort of weather that Benny Badger might have chosen for digging holes. But he must have thought that he had dug enough holes for the time being. He wandered about as if he had lost a hole somewhere and couldn't find it. And whenever he spied a hole made by one of his smaller neighbors he stopped and looked at it closely.  But none of them seemed to be the one he was looking for. At least, Benny examined a good many holes, and then passed on again, before he came to one at last that was different from all the rest. If you could have seen the look of pleasure on Benny's odd face when he caught sight of this particular hole you would have known at once that his search had come to an end.  Now, as a matter of fact, Benny Badger had not lost a hole. His strange behavior did not mean that. It meant that he was searching for a _fresh_ hole, which some ground squirrel had dug so short a time before that there couldn't be much doubt that the small owner was then living in it.  [Illustration: Mr. Ground Squirrel Escapes from Benny.]  To be sure, Benny might have dug his way to the furthest end of each hole that he found that night. And doubtless he would have enjoyed such a pastime. But as for finding a plump ground squirrel at the end of every tunnel--ah! that would have been a different matter. No such pleasant sight would have greeted Benny's eyes. And on this evening he wanted to find some such reward when his digging came to an end.  He knew as well as he knew anything in the world that newly scattered earth never lay strewn about the doorway of an _old_ hole.  And that was the reason he passed by so many holes with hardly more than a swift glance.  But when at length he found what he had been looking for--a hole with fresh brown dirt scattered carelessly around it--Benny Badger showed by every one of his actions that he didn't intend to move on until he had burrowed to the very end of it.  A broad smile lighted up his queerly marked face. At least, he opened his mouth and showed a good many of his teeth. And a bright, eager glint came into his eyes; whereas they had had a somewhat wistful look before, as if their owner might have been hungry, and didn't exactly know where he was going to find a meal.  Then Benny Badger looked all around, to see whether anybody might be watching him. But there was no one in sight. And if there had been, Benny Badger would have done no more than tell him that he had better run along about his business, because it would do him no good to wait--none at all.  And if the onlooker had happened to come so near as to bother Benny in what he intended to do, that unfortunate person might have wished that he had taken a bit of friendly advice in time, and made himself scarce.  But, of course, Benny Badger was not so foolish as to give any such warning, for there was no one there to hear it.     III  NO ONE AT HOME   Since there seemed to be nobody lurking in the shadows around him, and watching him, Benny Badger turned to the ground squirrel's hole and began to dig. How he did make the dirt fly! He scooped it up with his big feet and flung it back in a shower, not caring in the least where it fell. For he was interested not in what lay behind, but before him.  In almost less time than it takes to tell about it, Benny Badger had made the entrance of the tunnel so big that it swallowed his head and shoulders.  Now, when some people do anything they are forever stopping to see how much they have finished, as if they hated to work and wished that they didn't"]]]
