He woke with the recollection that something unpleasant was hanging over him, and by degrees he remembered what that something was; but it looked so extravagant in the morning light that he had great hopes all would turn out to be a mere dream.  It was a mild Sunday morning, and there were church bells ringing all around him; it seemed impossible that he could really be harbouring an animated antique. But to remove all doubt, he stole down, half dressed, to his small sitting-room, which he found looking as usual--the fire burning dull and dusty in the sunlight that struck in through the open window, and his breakfast laid out on the table.  Almost reassured, he went to the cupboard and unlocked the door. Alas! it held its skeleton--the statue was there, preserving the attitude of queenly command in which he had seen it first. Sharply he shut the door again, and turned the key with a heavy heart.  He swallowed his breakfast with very little appetite, after which he felt he could not remain in the house. \"To sit here with _that_ in the cupboard is more than I'm equal to all Sunday,\" he decided.  If Matilda had been at his aunt's, with whom she lodged, he would have gone to chapel with her; but Matilda did not return from her holiday till late that night. He thought of going to his friend and asking his advice on his case. James, as a barrister's clerk, would presumably be able to give a sound legal opinion on an emergency.  James, however, lived \"out Camden Town way,\" and was certain on so fine a morning to be away on some Sunday expedition with his betrothed: it was hopeless to go in search of him now. If he went to see his aunt, who lived close by in Millman Street, she might ask him about the ring, and there would be a fuss. He was in no humour for attending any place of public worship, and so he spent some hours in aimless wandering about the streets, which, as foreigners are fond of reminding us, are not exhilarating even on the brightest Sabbath, and did not raise his spirits then.  At last hunger drove him back to the passage in Southampton Row, the more quickly as it began to occur to him that the statue might possibly have revived, and be creating a disturbance in the cupboard.  He had passed the narrow posts, and was just taking out his latchkey, when some one behind touched his shoulder and made him give a guilty jump. He dreaded to find the goddess at his elbow; however, to his relief, he found a male stranger, plainly and respectably dressed.  \"You Mr. Tweddle the hairdresser?\" the stranger inquired.  Leander felt a wild impulse to deny it, and declare that he was his own friend, and had come to see himself on business, for he was in no social mood just then; but he ended by admitting that he supposed he was Mr. Tweddle.  \"So did I. Well, I want a little private talk with you, Mr. Tweddle. I've been hanging about for some time; but though I knocked and rang, I couldn't make a soul hear.\"  \"There isn't a soul inside,\" protested Tweddle, with unnecessary warmth; \"not a solitary soul! You wanted to talk with me. Suppose we take a turn round the square?\"  \"No, no. I won't keep you out; I'll come in with you!\"  Inwardly wondering what his visitor wanted, Leander led him in and lit the gas in his hair-cutting saloon. \"We shall be cosier here,\" he said; for he dared not take the stranger up in the room where the statue was concealed, for fear of accidents.  The man sat down in the operating-chair and crossed his legs. \"I dare say you're wondering what I've come about like this on a Sunday afternoon?\" he began.  \"Not at all,\" said Leander. \"Anything I can have the pleasure of doing for you----\"  \"It's only to answer a few questions. I understand you lost a ring at the Rosherwich Gardens yesterday evening: that's so, isn't it?\"  He was a military looking person, as Leander now perceived, and he had a close-trimmed iron-grey beard, a high colour, quick eyes, and a stiff hard-lipped mouth--not at all the kind of man to trifle with. And yet Leander felt no inclination to tell him his story; the stranger might be a reporter, and his adventure would \"get into the papers\"--perhaps reach Matilda's eyes.  \"I--I dropped a ring last night, certainly,\" he said; \"it may have been in the gardens, for what I know.\"  \"Now, now,\" said the stranger, \"don't you _know_ it was in the gardens? Tell me all about it.\"  \"Begging your pardon,\" said Leander, \"I should like to know first what call you have to _be_ told.\"  \"You're quite right--perfectly right. I always deal straightforwardly when I can. I'll tell you who I am. I'm Inspector Bilbow, of the Criminal Investigation Department, Scotland Yard. Now, perhaps, you'll see I'm not a man to be kept in the dark. And I want you to tell me when and where you last saw that ring of yours: it's to your own interest, if you want to see it again.\"  But Leander _had_ seen it again, and it seemed certain that all Scotland Yard could not assist him in getting it back; he must manage it single-handed.  \"It's very kind of you, Mr. Inspector, to try and find it for me,\" he said; \"but the fact is, it--it ain't so valuable as I fancied. I can't afford to have it traced--it's not worth it!\"  The inspector laughed. \"I never said it was, that I know. The job I'm in charge of is a bigger concern than your trumpery ring, my friend.\"  \"Then I don't see what I've got to do with it,\" said Leander.  The officer had taken his measure by this time; he must admit his man into a show of confidence, and appeal to his vanity, if he was to obtain any information he could rely upon.  \"You're a shrewd chap, I see; 'nothing for nothing' is your motto, eh? Well, if you help me in this, and put me on the track I want, it'll be a fine thing for you. You'll be a principal witness at the police-court; name in the papers; regular advertisement for you!\"  This prospect, had he known it--but even inspectors cannot know everything--was the last which could appeal to Leander in his peculiar position. \"I don't care for notoriety,\" he said loftily; \"I scorn it.\"  \"Oho!\" said the inspector, shifting his ground. \"Well, you don't want to impede the course of justice, do you?--because that's what you seem to me to be after, and you won't find it pay in the long run. I'll get this out of you in a friendly way if I can; if not, some other way. Come, give me your account, fair and full, of how you came to lose that ring; there's no help for it--you must!\"  Leander saw this and yielded. After all, it did not much matter, for of course he would not touch upon the strange sequel of his ill-omened act; so he told the story faithfully and circumstantially, while the inspector took it all down in his note-book, questioning him closely respecting the exact time of each occurrence.  At last he closed his note-book with a snap. \"I'm not obliged to tell you anything in return for all this,\" he said; \"but I will, and then you'll see the importance of holding your tongue till I give you leave to talk about it.\"  \"_I_ shan't talk about it,\" said Leander.  \"I don't advise you to. I suppose you've heard of that affair at Wricklesmarsh Court? What! not that business where a gang broke into the sculpture gallery, one of the finest private collections in England? You surprise me!\"  \"And what did they steal?\" asked Leander.  \"They stole the figure whose finger you were ass enough (if you'll allow me the little familiarity) to put your ring on. What do you think of that?\"  A wild rush of ideas coursed through the hairdresser's head. Was this policeman \"after\" the goddess upstairs? Did he know anything more? Would it be better to give up the statue at once and get rid of it? But then--his ring would be lost for ever!  \"It's surprising,\" he said at last. \"But what did they want to go and burgle a plaster figure for?\"  \"That's where it is, you see; she ain't plaster--she's marble, a genuine antic of Venus, and worth thousands. The beggars who broke in knew that, and took nothing else. They'd made all arrangements to get away with her abroad, and pass her off on some foreign collection before it got blown upon; and they'd have done it too if we hadn't been beforehand with them! So what do they do then? They drive up with her to these gardens, ask to see the manager, and say they're agents for some Fine Arts business, and have a sample with them, to be disposed of at a low price. The manager, so he tells me, had a look at it, thought it a neat article and suitable to the style of his gardens. He took it to be plain plaster, as they said, and they put it up for him their own selves, near the small gate up by the road; then they took the money--a pound or two they asked for it--and drove away, and he saw no more of them.\"  \"And was that all they got for their pains?\" said Leander.  The inspector smiled indulgently. \"Don't you see your way yet?\" he asked. \"Can't you give a guess where that statue's got to now, eh?\"  \"No,\" said Leander, with what seemed to the inspector a quite uncalled-for excitement, \"of course I can't! What do you ask me for? How should I know?\"  \"Quite so,\" said the other; \"you want a mind trained to deal with these things. It may surprise you to hear it, but I know as well how that statue disappeared, and what was done with her, as if I'd been there!\"  \"Do you, though?\" thought Leander, who was beginning to doubt whether his visitor's penetration was anything so abnormal. \"What was done with her?\" he asked.  \"Why, it was a plant from the first. They knew all their regular holes were stopped, and they wanted a place to dump her down in, where she wouldn't attract attention, till they could call for her again; so they got her taken in at the gardens, where they could come in any time by the gate and fetch her off again--and very neatly it was done, too!\"  \"But where do you make out they've taken her to now?\" asked Leander, who was naturally anxious to discover if the official had any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24197"],["title","The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance (#8)"],["body","of him.  \"I've my own theory about that,\" was his answer. \"I shall hunt that Venus down, sir; I'll stake my reputation on it.\"  \"Venus is her name, it seems,\" thought Leander. \"She told me it was Aphrodite. But perhaps the other's her Christian name. It can't be the Venus I've seen pictures of--she's dressed too decent.\"  \"Yes,\" repeated the inspector, \"I shall hunt her down now. I don't envy the poor devil who's giving her house-room; he'll have reason to repent it!\"  \"How do you know any one's giving her house-room?\" inquired Leander; \"and why should he repent it?\"  \"Ask your own common sense. They daren't take her back to any of their own places; they know better. They haven't left the country with her. What remains? They've bribed or got over some mug of an outsider to be their accomplice, and a bad speculation he'll find it, too.\"  \"What would be done to him?\" asked the hairdresser, with a quite unpleasant internal sensation.  [Illustration: \"WHAT WOULD BE DONE TO HIM?\" ASKED THE HAIRDRESSER, WITH A QUITE UNPLEASANT INTERNAL SENSATION.]  \"That is a question I wouldn't pretend to decide; but I've no hesitation in saying that the party on whose premises that statue is discovered will wish he'd died before he ever set eyes on her.\"  \"You're quite right there!\" said Leander. \"Well, sir, I'm afraid I haven't been much assistance to you.\"  \"Never mind that,\" said the inspector, encouragingly; \"you've answered my questions; you've not hindered the law, and that's a game some burn their fingers at.\"  Leander let him out, and returned to his saloon with his head in a worse whirl than before. He did not think the detective suspected him. He was clearly barking up the wrong tree at present; but so acute a mind could not be long deceived, and if once Leander was implicated his guilt would appear beyond denial. Would the police believe that the statue had run after him? No one would believe it! To be found in possession of that fatal work of art would inevitably ruin him.  He might carry her away to some lonely spot and leave her, but where was the use? She would only come back again; or he might be taken in the act. He dared not destroy her; his right arm had been painful all day after that last attempt.  If he gave her up to the authorities, he would have to explain how he came to be in a position to do so, which, as he now saw, would be a difficult undertaking; and even then he would lose all chance of recovering his ring in time to satisfy his aunt and Matilda. There was no way out of it, unless he could induce Venus to give up the token and leave him alone.  \"Cuss her!\" he said angrily; \"a pretty bog she's led me into, she and that minx, Ada Parkinson!\"  He felt so thoroughly miserable that hunger had vanished, and he dreaded the idea of an evening at home, though it was a blusterous night, with occasional vicious spirts of rain, and by no means favourable to continued pacing of streets and squares.  \"I'm hanged if I don't think I'll go to church!\" he thought; \"and perhaps I shall feel more equal to supper afterwards.\"  He went upstairs to get his best hat and overcoat, and was engaged in brushing the former in his sitting-room, when from within the cupboard he heard a shower of loud raps.  His knees trembled. \"She's wuss than any ghost!\" he thought; but he took no notice, and went on brushing his hat, while he endeavoured to hum a hymn.  \"Leander!\" cried the clear, hard voice he knew too well, \"I have returned. Release me!\"  His first idea was to run out of the house and seek sanctuary in some pew in the opposite church. \"But there,\" he thought disgustedly, \"she'd only come in and sit next to me. No, I'll pluck up a spirit and have it out with her!\" and he threw open the door.  \"How have you dared to imprison me in this narrow tomb?\" she demanded majestically, as she stepped forth.  Leander cringed. \"It's a nice roomy cupboard,\" he said. \"I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind putting up with it, especially as you invited yourself,\" he could not help adding.  \"When I found myself awake and in utter darkness,\" she said, \"I thought you had buried me beneath the soil.\"  \"Buried you!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden perception that he might do worse.  \"And in that thought I was preparing to invoke the forces that lie below the soil to come to my aid, burst the masses that impeded me, and overwhelm you and all this ugly swarming city in one vast ruin!\"  \"I won't bury her,\" Leander decided. \"I'm sorry you hadn't a better opinion of me, mum,\" he said aloud. \"You see, how you came to be in there was this way: when you went out, like the snuff of a candle, so to speak, you left your statue standing in the middle of the floor, and I had to put it somewhere where it wouldn't be seen.\"  \"You did well,\" she said indulgently, \"to screen my image from the vulgar sight; and if you had no statelier shrine wherein to instal it, the fault lies not with you. You are pardoned.\"  \"Thank you, mum,\" said Leander; \"and now let me ask you if you intend to animate that statue like this as a regular thing?\"  \"So long as your obstinacy continues, or until it outlives my forbearance, I shall return at intervals,\" she said. \"Why do you ask this?\"  \"Well,\" said Leander, with a sinking heart, but hoping desperately to move her by the terrors of the law, \"it's my duty to tell you that that image you're in is stolen property.\"  \"Has it been stolen from one of my temples?\" she asked.  \"I dare say--I don't know; but there's the police moving heaven and earth to get you back again!\"  \"He is good and pious--the police, and if I knew him I would reward him.\"  \"There's a good many hims in the police--that's what we call our guards for the street, who take up thieves and bad characters; and, being stolen, they're all of 'em after _you_; and if they had a notion where you were, they'd be down on you, and back you'd go to wherever you've come from--some gallery, I believe, where you wouldn't get away again in a hurry! Now, I tell you what it is, if you don't give me up that ring, and go away and leave me in quiet, I'll tell the police who you are and where you are. I mean what I say, by George I do!\"  \"We know not George, nor will it profit you to invoke him now,\" said the goddess. \"See, I will deign to reason with you as with some froward child. Think you that, should the guards seize my image, _I_ should remain within, or that it is aught to me where this marble presentment finds a resting-place while I am absent therefrom? But for you, should you surrender it into their hands, would there be no punishment for your impiety in thus concealing a divine effigy?\"  \"She ain't no fool!\" thought Leander; \"she mayn't understand our ways, but she's a match for me notwithstanding. I must try another line.\"  \"Lady Venus,\" he began, \"if that's the proper way to call you, I didn't mean any threats--far from it. I'll be as humble as you please. You look a good-natured lady; you wouldn't want to make a man uncomfortable, I'm sure. Do give me back that ring, for mercy's sake! If I haven't got it to show in a day or two, I shall be ruined!\"  \"Should any mortal require the ring of you, you have but to reply, 'I have placed it upon the finger of Aphrodite, whose spouse I am!' Thus will you have honour amongst mortals, being held blameless!\"  \"Blameless!\" cried Leander, in pardonable exasperation. \"That's all you know about it! And what am I to say to the lady it lawfully belongs to?\"  \"You have lied to me, then, and you are already affianced! Tell me the abode of this maiden of yours.\"  \"What do you want it for?\" he inquired, hoping faintly she might intend to restore the ring.  \"To seek it out, to go to her abode, to crush her! Is she not my rival?\"  \"Crush my Matilda?\" he cried in agony. \"You'll never do such a thing as that?\"  \"You have revealed her name! I have but to ask in your streets, 'Where abideth Matilda, the beloved of Leander, the dresser of hair? Lead me to her dwelling.' And having arrived thereat, I shall crush her, and thus she shall deservedly perish!\"  He was horrified at the possible effects of his slip, which he hastened to repair. \"You won't find it so easy to come at her, luckily,\" he said; \"there's hundreds of Matildas in London alone.\"  \"Then,\" said the goddess, sweetly and calmly, \"it is simple: I shall crush them all.\"  \"Oh, lor!\" whimpered Leander, \"here's a bloodthirsty person! Where's the sense of doing that?\"  \"Because, dissipated reveller that you are, you love them.\"  \"Now, when did I ever say I loved them? I don't even know more than two or three, and those I look on as sisters--in fact\" (here he hit upon a lucky evasion) \"they _are_ sisters--it's only another name for them. I've a brother and three Matildas, and here are you talking of crushing my poor sisters as if they were so many beadles--all for nothing!\"  \"Is this the truth? Palter not with me! You are pledged to no mortal bride?\"  \"I'm a bachelor. And as for the ring, it belongs to my aunt, who's over fifty.\"  \"Then no one stands between us, and you are mine!\"  \"Don't talk so ridiculous! I tell you I ain't yours--it's a free country, this is!\"  \"If I--an immortal--can stoop thus, it becomes you not to reject the dazzling favour.\"  A last argument occurred to him. \"But I reelly don't think, mum,\" he said persuasively, \"that you can be quite aware of the extent of the stoop. The fact is, I am, as I've tried to make you understand, a hairdresser; some might lower themselves so far as to call me a barber. Now, hairdressing, whatever may be said for it\" (he could not readily bring himself to decry his profession)--\"hairdressing is considribly below you in social rank. I wouldn't deceive you by saying otherwise. I assure you that, if you had any ideer what a barber was, you wouldn't be so pressing.\"  She seemed to be struck by this. \"You say well!\" she observed, thoughtfully; \"your occupation may be base and degrading, and if so, it were well for me to know it.\"  \"If you were once"]]]
