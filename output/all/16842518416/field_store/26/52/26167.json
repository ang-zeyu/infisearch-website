Finally, after a lingering glance out the front window, she picked up her last vase of flowers, a single branch of apple blossoms in a tall, green jar, and, crossing over to the grand piano so placed it that the sunlight shone full upon it.  Then she stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the open keyboard, which had a small sheet of music spread before it.  Esther Clark next sat down at the piano and lightly ran her fingers over the keys so that it could scarcely have been possible for any one farther away than the adjoining hall to have heard her playing.  The refrain was simple and repeated itself, yet had dramatic force and lingered in one's memory, the musical call of the watchword for the Camp Fire Girls.  Only that morning Betty had asked Esther to try to teach this call to her friends when they came together at her home that afternoon to form their club, and though Esther was painfully shy she felt obliged to do her best. Some few of Betty's friends were known to her through their acquaintance at school, but into not one of their homes had she ever been invited socially.  The door of the drawing-room farthest from the piano opened quietly.  \"Betty,\" a young man's voice inquired reproachfully, \"aren't you even glad enough to see me to say hello?  When before did I ever know you so devoted to practicing that you wouldn't stop for any excuse, and yet here I have come all the way home from Portsmouth on your account!\"  Richard Ashton ceased talking abruptly, for instead of the pretty figure of his sister, Betty, he now beheld rising from the piano stool a tall girl with bright red hair, looking as though she had been frightened speechless.  \"Great Caesar's ghost, what a homely girl!\" was his first thought, but not a change in his expression revealed what was in the young man's mind as he stretched forth his hand.  \"I am sorry to have interrupted you,\" he said quickly, \"but I am Richard Ashton, Betty's brother.\"  Of course he expected that the strange girl would then answer him, at least tell him who she was or give some explanation of her presence, but instead Esther stood silently looking down at the floor and twisting her hands together in a wholly unnecessary state of embarrassment.  Richard Ashton was of medium height, slenderly built, but with broad shoulders, and at this time of life twenty-three years old.  His hair and eyes were light brown; he bore no resemblance to Betty and had a curiously serious expression for so young and fortunate a fellow. Although not handsome, Dick had a look of purpose and distinction and always had unconsciously served as the ideal for Betty's girl friends. He was a Princeton graduate, but was now studying medicine in Portsmouth and expected later to continue his studies in Germany.  Perhaps it was his own seriousness and settled purpose that had made him assist in spoiling his small sister almost from her babyhood, yet lately seeing Betty's restlessness and discontent he had begun to wonder if he and his father and mother had been as kind to her as they had meant to be. Betty was growing up and it might be she too needed to have something asked of her, that she too wished to give as well as to receive.  \"I am not your sister's friend (the girl near the piano had finally made up her mind to speak), I am only a kind of companion, to help her with her studying or to do whatever she desires.\"  Dick Ashton laughed, his face immediately losing its look of gravity. \"Well, that is no particular reason why you should not be her friend as well, is it?  At least I hope Betty won't make the task too hard for you, but as to doing all the things she desires, I am afraid that will keep you pretty busy.  I believe I remember now, my mother did write me about asking you to come here to stay; you have lived before--\"  The young man hesitated.  But Esther had now come nearer and really she seemed almost too plain even to serve his pretty sister, Betty, the contrast might be too hard for the homely girl.  \"You were playing something when I came in, won't you go on,\" Dick continued hastily, fearing that the strange girl, with her pale eyes fixed on his, might be able to read his inmost thoughts and not desiring to hurt her feelings.  However she had started, edging toward the door. \"I would much rather not; your sister is to have some friends here this afternoon and wishes me to teach them a few lines of music.  I hope your mother won't mind my touching this splendid piano.\"  \"What on earth is the girl afraid of?  I have no desire to eat her,\" Richard thought to himself, continuing to observe Esther's frightened expression and nervous manner, but only answering good-naturedly: \"Certainly she won't mind.  Please use the piano whenever you like, for Betty hates practicing and I don't care much for a man musician, especially a poor one, though I love music.\"  Just for a moment the newcomer's timidity vanished and her smile of pleasure, showing her big, strong mouth with its white teeth, relieved her face of its entire plainness.  \"I should love it more than anything in the world; would you mind asking your mother if I may?  I am afraid to ask her.\"  \"But not afraid of asking me?\" Richard laughed; he had made his suggestion without any special thought, but the girl might as well be allowed to bang at their piano if she liked.  Should she get it out of order why it could soon be straightened out again.  And then kindness to persons less fortunate than himself was second nature with Richard Ashton.  \"Here is the mater coming, I will ask her at once,\" he returned, and then seeing Esther's unspoken look of entreaty, as he went forward to open the door for his mother, he silently agreed to postpone his request.  Mrs. Ashton was a tall, blonde, handsomely dressed woman, who rarely showed affection for anyone save her husband and children and whose leisure time was largely devoted to playing bridge.  Neither Betty nor her son looked like her.  Richard resembled his father, while Betty must have inherited her appearance from some more remote ancestor.  In one comer of the parlor hung an oil painting of one of Mr. Ashton's great-aunts, a young English girl in a white muslin dress and picture hat, whom Betty always insisted she resembled.  Mrs. Ashton was frowning anxiously.  \"Hasn't Betty returned, Dick?\" she inquired.  \"It is an hour since luncheon and her friends may arrive at any moment.  The child was not at all well yesterday and, I do wonder if her science teacher can be keeping her in, Miss McMurtry is so inconsiderate.  I really don't know what to do about Betty this summer, she is so opposed to going to Europe with us again and wants to form a club or a camp, something perfectly extraordinary, so as to spend her summer in the woods.  She almost talked your father into the idea last evening, but I do hope, dear Richard, that you will oppose her.  You have such influence with Betty.\"  Dick and his mother were standing together by the window now on the lookout, for the truant.  \"Don't be such a weakling, mother,\" the young man replied teasingly.  \"If you really wish Betty to go to Europe with you and father say so and let that settle the matter, but I am not so sure this new scheme of hers is a bad one.  Betty sent me a night telegram at bedtime last night (telephoned it, I suppose, when you thought she was in bed) asking me to come home for the day and help her get her own way.  Living out of doors all summer, mother, and learning to look after herself and to rub up against other girls may be the best thing in the world for Betty.  I am afraid she has been growing up to be more ornamental than useful.\"  \"There is no reason why Betty should be anything but ornamental,\" Mrs. Ashton argued, although plainly thinking over her son's words.  Dick Ashton shook his head.  \"No, mother, the modern world has no place in it but for useful people nowadays.  And somehow it seems to me that even more is going to be asked of women than has been asked of men. They have got to do their own housekeeping and some of the world's too, pretty soon.\"  Before the young fellow finished speaking he and his mother were both smiling and waving their hands toward Mollie and Polly O'Neill, who were at this moment crossing the street with several other girl friends. Before they entered the house, however, Betty's automobile, driven by herself, dashed into sight, containing five other passengers: Margaret Everett and her small brother; Miss McMurtry, the science teacher at the high school; a tall girl with a clever face and a far-away expression in her near-sighted blue eyes; and a fifth girl, an entire stranger both to Mrs. Ashton and Dick and until a short while before an equal stranger to Betty.  Almost before the car stopped Betty was out of her seat and ushering her visitors into their big, sweet-smelling drawing-room.  There Esther stood close against the wall, trying her best to shrink out of sight even while she reproached herself for her unnecessary awkwardness and fear.  Suppose she had had no home and no social training like the greater number of these other girls, yet did she not mean to follow forever the law of the Camp Fire and would it not teach her in time to gain the knowledge necessary to happiness?     CHAPTER VI  THE LAW OF THE CAMP FIRE   \"Esther, won't you repeat the Law of the Camp Fire for the girls?\" Miss McMurtry asked, fifteen minutes later, when Betty's guests were seated in a close circle about the drawing-room, their faces eager with curiosity.  Esther alone sat at some distance from the others, so that Betty was compelled to draw her forward toward the center of their group.  How she longed to refuse to recite, for instead of a dozen pairs of eyes fastened upon her she felt there must be at least a hundred!  Yet catching an expression of amused "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8662"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at Sunrise Hill (#7)"],["body","on Dick Ashton's face somehow she felt encouraged to go on.  \"Esther and I have been studying the plan of the Camp Fire organization for the past two months and it is really very simple,\" Miss McMurtry continued. \"One must just follow certain general rules and then add whatever seems appropriate to give one's special camp originality and character.  I had been hoping to form a club in the village this summer, but of course if we can carry out Betty's idea and spend our summer together in the woods, why we will learn in a few months what it might have taken us years to find out in weekly meetings in town.\"  The young woman stopped, turning toward Esther, and the girl then felt obliged to speak.  Esther's voice was low, but had that rare quality given to but a few voices of being heard at even a great distance without being raised.  \"Seek beauty. Give service. Pursue knowledge. Be trustworthy. Hold on to health. Glorify work. Be happy.\"  With each line, feeling the sympathy of her small audience increase, Esther gained courage until at last she was able to finish her verse with fervor and conviction.  After her conclusion most of the faces near her were unusually thoughtful until Polly O'Neill, seated next Mrs. Ashton, gave a characteristic laugh followed by a sigh.  \"My dear children, if we ever learn to live up to that law of the Camp Fire, then shall we be angels and not girls!\" she exclaimed.  And she might have added more had not an imploring frown from Betty silenced her.  Of course some of the girls would understand that Polly rarely meant what she said, but there we're other members of the little company with whom Betty wished to take no risks.  Besides, Polly's laugh could sometimes dampen even her own enthusiasm!  And had she not placed her friend next her mother in order that she might interest Mrs. Ashton in their plan, for Polly was a great favorite with the older woman and never afraid of using her pretty blarney stone with her.  However, except for a laugh no one seemed in the least influenced by Polly's skepticism.  \"We can at least try to live up to the law,\" Mollie replied quietly, answering from her chair a few feet away.  In a few moments, however, Betty no longer feared the effect of her friend's attitude.  Perhaps to some of the girls the idea of a summer camp seemed too beautiful to be possible, yet plainly the ideals of the Camp Fire organization, as Miss McMurtry explained them more fully, had fired their imaginations, filling them with new hopes and enthusiasm.  Meg had been listening to what had been said with glowing cheeks, meaning to become a Camp Fire girl even though it was entirely impossible for her to join the summer camp.  She was holding her small brother tight in her arms, trying to distract his attention with objects to be seen out the front window, and so entirely oblivious of the fact that the hastily adjusted hairpins had been slipping out of her hair, until one yellow braid now dangled over her pink ear.  Mollie O'Neill's cheeks were also flushed, but she sat perfectly still, keeping her hands clasped tight together in a fashion she had when desiring a thing greatly and not feeling sure she would receive it.  Eleanor Meade had even forgiven Betty for dragging her away from her unfinished painting of the May, sky (a painting which Meg and Betty had assured her resembled soap suds), so enthralled had she become with the summer plan.  If her parents could be persuaded to allow her to stay in camp with the girls during the summer, why then surely she need not be bothered with having to take exercise and help with the housework, as her mother insisted, she could simply give up all her time to her drawing and painting.  You see Eleanor, like a good many other girls, did not at once grasp the meaning of the Camp Fire idea.  Apparently only one person in Mrs. Ashton's drawing-room up to this time seemed to have gotten nothing at all out of Miss McMurtry's explanations and the girls' discussion of a Camp Fire club.  But then how could she, for Sylvia Wharton apparently had not listened and certainly had never taken her eyes from Polly's face?  She appeared a stupid child, short and stout and, although fourteen, hardly seemed more than twelve.  Her clothes were expensive but always inappropriate, indeed they were far too handsome for such a plain little girl.  However, they were in accord with her father's taste, and although Mr. Wharton was now a wealthy man, he had begun life as a stone-cutter and could hardly be expected to know much about the proper way to dress a small, motherless daughter.  Several times in the past half hour Polly had almost yielded to the inclination to implore Sylvia to take her eyes off her, for the little girl did not look sensitive and her eyes were so large and expressionless they made one uncomfortable, but then Polly forbore, until, as her own interest in their meeting proceeded, she forgot all about her inquisitor.  It must have been about five o'clock when Betty at last arose and holding a curiously wrought silver ring, a bracelet and a pin in her hand, started to walk slowly about among the circle of her guests.  \"If you wish to join our Camp Fire club this afternoon,\" she invited coaxingly, \"you are simply to repeat the lines Esther has just recited for us.  Then Miss McMurtry says you may each receive a woodgatherers' ring. Afterwards, when we have acquired sufficient honors in the seven crafts, 'Health Craft, Home Craft, Nature Lore, Camp Craft, Business and Patriotism',\" (Betty repeated the list slowly as though not quite certain of herself), \"why then we may attain next to the rank of Fire-Makers and wear their bracelets.  The highest honor of all, which I for one shall probably never attain, is to become a Torch Bearer and receive the Torch Bearer's pin.  It is all right for me to give the girls the rings, isn't it, Miss McMurtry, after they have repeated the law to you?\" Betty asked, \"since you have been appointed official guardian by the headquarters in New York?  Later on I suppose the girls will tell us when they will wish to come into camp.\"  Miss McMurtry laughed.  Never until this afternoon had she had any liking for Betty Ashton.  They were such utterly different types of woman and girl!  Yet, now Betty's habit of expecting to have her own way, which her teacher so disliked, was assuredly making their Camp Fire plans go ahead with a rush.  \"Yes, I am a properly appointed guardian,\" Miss McMurtry answered slowly, \"and Esther and I have been studying the Camp Fire program until she is almost ready to become a Fire-Maker, but I wonder if, you girls wish me to be your guardian in camp this summer?  Perhaps I am not suited to it!\"  She turned to look at Betty, but failing to catch her eye, looked toward Polly. For the same reason both girls kept their heads bowed, until Betty was finally able to reply with as much enthusiasm as she could muster:  \"Oh, of course we wish you, and we shall try to give as little trouble as possible.\"  Really in her present enthusiasm Betty believed that she and her science teacher would be able to put away all past differences and live in perfect accord under the influence of their new ideals.  Miss McMurtry now turned again to Esther; there were special reasons for her unusual interest in this girl, although even Esther herself was unaware of them.  \"You are wearing your bead chains, aren't you?\" the new guardian asked, slipping two narrow strips of leather, one strung with orange and the other with bright red beads, from about Esther's throat.  \"You see each one of these beads represents some honor a girl has attained in the Camp Fire,\" she explained, \"so the girl who finally arrives at the rank of Torch Bearer, really an assistant to the guardian, may own seven different chains of bead, one color for each of the seven crafts.\"  \"My honors so far have been won in health and home craft because of what I was taught at the orphan asylum,\" Esther added frankly and then blushed uncomfortably, for several of Betty's friends were staring at her curiously.  What had inspired Mrs. Ashton and Betty, supposed to be the most exclusive persons in Woodford, to introduce this unknown girl into their home as though she were a member of their family?  Moreover, Betty must have suffered another change of heart for she was now engaged in almost forcing a Wood-Gatherer's ring upon the stranger whom she had lately brought home in the automobile with her.  Mrs. Ashton lifted her lorgnettes to gaze at the visitor.  \"Tell me, Polly dear,\" she whispered, \"who is that girl with whom Betty is now talking? She is not one of her school friends and yet I feel I have seen her somewhere before, though I am not able to place her.\"  Polly smiled, shaking her head.  \"You have seen her, I know I have many times, although she is not a friend or even an acquaintance of mine. But I don't know what has happened to 'The Princess', so I would rather you would put your question to her after we go away.\"  Mrs. Ashton kept hold of Polly's hand.  Two maids had just come into the drawing-room at this moment and were passing plates of cake and cups of hot chocolate about among the guests.  The greater number of the girls were crowding around Miss McMurtry and Betty, so only Dick Ashton happened to notice that no one, not even a maid, had come near Esther. Securing chocolate and cake for her himself, he sat down next her, talking but asking no questions, since he feared to embarrass her as he had earlier in the afternoon.  \"Do you think, Polly, that this is really a good plan of Betty's?\" Mrs. Ashton inquired thoughtfully.  \"She has seemed so restless and dissatisfied lately.  Of course I don't understand all this Camp Fire idea seems to mean to her, I suppose I would have to be a girl again to understand thoroughly, but there may be possibilities in it.  Even a conventional society woman longs sometimes to get away from her monotonous life,"]]]
