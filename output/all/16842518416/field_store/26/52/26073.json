NEAPOLITAN CREAMS  In this group we have a set of frozen desserts called by many \"ice creams,\" but which are really frozen custards, flavored. In localities where cream is not accessible, the Neapolitan Creams are far better than milk thickened with cornstarch or gelatin.

WALNUT       1 pint of cream      1 pint of milk      2 eggs    1/2 pint of chopped black walnuts      1 teaspoonful of vanilla      1 teaspoonful of caramel  Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until light; add the well-beaten whites, and then the milk, scalding hot.

This will serve eight persons.   NEAPOLITAN BLOCKS  These are made by putting layers of various kinds and colors of ice creams into a brick mold. Pack and freeze. At serving time, cut into slices crosswise of the brick, and serve each slice on a paper mat.     ICE CREAMS FROM CONDENSED MILK   These creams are not so good as those made from raw cream, but with care and good flavoring are quite as good as the ordinary Neapolitan Creams.  There is one advantage--condensed milk is not so liable to curdle when mixed with fresh fruits. These recipes will answer also for what is sold under the name of \"Evaporated Cream.\" Use unsweetened milk, or allow for the sugar in the sweetened varieties.   BANANA       6 large bananas    1/4 pound of sugar      1 half pint can of condensed milk    1/2 cupful of water        Juice of one lemon  Press the bananas through a sieve, and add the lemon juice and sugar. Stand aside a half hour, add milk and water, stir until the sugar is dissolved, and freeze as directed on page 7.  This will serve six persons.   CARAMEL     1/4 cupful of brown sugar    1/2 cupful of granulated sugar      1 cupful of water      2 half pint cans of condensed milk      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Put the brown sugar in an iron pan, melt and brown it. When it begins to smoke, add two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Stir until liquid. Pour out the milk, rinse the cans with the water, add the caramel, vanilla and granulated sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, freeze as directed on page 7.  This will serve six persons.   COCOANUT       2 large cocoanuts      1 pint of boiling water    1/2 pint can of sweetened condensed milk  Grate the cocoanuts and pour over them the boiling water. Stir until it is cool, and press in a sieve. Put the fibre in a cheese cloth and wring it dry; add this to the water that was strained through the sieve. When cold, add condensed milk, and freeze as directed on page 7.  This will serve eight persons.   CHOCOLATE, No. 1       2 ounces of Baker's chocolate    1/2 pint of water      1 saltspoonful of ground cinnamon      2 half pint cans of condensed milk      1 teaspoonful of vanilla    1/4 pound of sugar  Put the water, chocolate, sugar and cinnamon in a saucepan; stir until boiling. Take from the fire, add the vanilla and the condensed milk. When cold, freeze as directed on page 7.  This will serve six persons.   CHOCOLATE, No. 2       4 ounces of Baker's chocolate    1/2 pint of water    1/2 pound of sugar      2 half pint cans of condensed milk      1 pint of milk      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla      1 saltspoonful of ground cinnamon  Put the chocolate, sugar, water and cinnamon in a saucepan over the fire. Stir until the mixture boils. Take from the fire, and add all the remaining ingredients. When cold, freeze as directed on page 7.  This will serve eight persons.   COFFEE       1 pint of strong black coffee    1/2 cupful of sugar    1/2 pint can of condensed milk      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Add the sugar to the hot coffee, and stir until it is dissolved; add the milk, using water enough to rinse out the cans; add the vanilla. When the mixture is cold, freeze, turning it rapidly toward the end of the freezing.  This will serve four persons.   PEACH      12 ripe or canned peaches      4 peach kernels    1/2 pint of water      2 half pint cans of unsweetened condensed milk    1/2 pound of sugar  Put the sugar, water and peach kernels over the fire; stir until the sugar is dissolved, and boil three minutes. Pare the peaches and press them through a colander, add to them the strained syrup. When cold, turn the mixture into the freezer and turn the crank slowly until partly frozen; add the milk, and continue the freezing.  Omit the water and use less sugar with canned peaches.  This will serve ten persons.   ORANGE, No. 1       1 full pint of orange juice    2/3 cupful of sugar    1/2 pint can of condensed milk        Grated yellow rind of two oranges  Grate the rinds into the sugar, add milk and enough water to rinse cans. When sugar is dissolved, stand it in a cold place. Put orange juice in the freezer and freeze it quite hard; add sweetened milk, and freeze again quickly.  This will serve four persons.   ORANGE, No. 2  Freeze a full quart of orange juice. When quite hard, add a can of sweetened condensed milk, freeze it again, and serve at once.  This is very nice and will serve eight persons.   ORANGE GELATIN CREAM     1/2 pint of orange juice      1 package of orange Jello    1/2 pound of sugar      1 pint can of unsweetened condensed milk    1/2 pint of water  Add the grated yellow rind of two oranges to the Jello; add the sugar and the water, boiling. Stir until the sugar and Jello are dissolved, add the orange juice, and when the mixture is cold, put it in the freezer and stir slowly until it begins to freeze. Add the condensed milk, and continue the freezing.  This is nice served in tall glasses, with the beaten whites of the eggs made into a meringue and heaped on top.  In this way it will serve eight persons.   SOUR SOP       1 large sour sop    1/4 pound of sugar    1/2 pint can of unsweetened condensed milk      4 tablespoonfuls of boiling water        Juice of one lime  Squeeze the sour sop, which should measure nearly one quart; add the sugar melted in the water with the lime juice and milk, and freeze slowly.  This will serve ten persons.     FROZEN PUDDINGS AND DESSERTS   ALASKA BAKE   Make a vanilla ice cream, one or two quarts, as the occasion demands. When the ice cream is frozen, pack it in a brick mold, cover each side of the mold with letter paper and fasten the bottom and lid. Wrap the whole in wax paper and pack it in salt and ice; freeze for at least two hours before serving time. At serving time, make a meringue from the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth; add six tablespoonfuls of sifted powdered sugar and beat until fine and dry. Turn the ice cream from the mold, place it on a serving platter, and stand the platter on a steak board or an ordinary thick plank. Cover the mold with the meringue pressed through a star tube in a pastry bag, or spread it all over the ice cream as you would ice a cake. Decorate the top quickly, and dust it thickly with powdered sugar; stand it under the gas burners in a gas broiler or on the grate in a hot coal or wood oven until it is lightly browned, and send it quickly to the table. There is no danger of the ice cream melting if you will protect the under side of the plate. The meringue acts as a nonconductor for the upper part.  A two quart mold with meringue will serve ten persons.   ALEXANDER BOMB       1 pint of cream      1 pint of milk      4 eggs      4 tart apples      1 pint of water      1 glassful of orange blossoms water      1 wineglassful of curaçao      1 pound of sugar        Juice of one lemon  Peel, core and quarter the apples; put them in a saucepan with the grated yellow rind of the lemon, half the sugar and all the water; boil until tender, and add the juice of the lemon; rub the apples through a sieve. When cold, freeze. Whip the cream. Beat the eggs and the remaining sugar and add them to the milk, hot; stir until the mixture thickens, take from the fire, and, when cold, add the orange blossoms water and the Curaçao; freeze in another freezer. Divide the whipped cream, and stir one-half into the first and one-half into the other mixture. Line a melon mold with the custard mixture, fill the centre space with the frozen apples, and cover over another layer of the custard; put over a sheet of letter paper and put on the lid. Bind the seam with a strip of muslin dipped in paraffin or suet, and pack the mold in salt and ice; freeze for at least two hours. Serve plain, or it may be garnished with whipped cream.  This will serve twelve persons.   BISCUITS AMERICANA       1 quart of cream    1/2 pound of sugar    1/4 pound of Jordan almonds      1 teaspoonful of almond extract      1 teaspoonful of vanilla        Yolks of six eggs        Grated rind of one lemon  Put half the cream "]]]
