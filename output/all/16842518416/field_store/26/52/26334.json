'Member dat?\"  Jimmy nodded.  \"And some of dose knock-out drops. What's dat? Chloryform? Dat's right. An' we didn't do a t'ing else. An' we lived for de rest of de year on dose jools.\"  Spike paused.  \"Dat was to de good,\" he said wistfully.  Jimmy made no reply.  \"Dere's a loidy here,\" continued Spike, addressing the chest of drawers, \"dat's got a necklace of jools what's wort' two hundred thousand plunks.\"  \"I know.\"  Silence again.  \"Two hundred thousand plunks,\" breathed Spike.  \"What a necklace!\" thought Jimmy.  \"Keggs told me dat. De old gazebo what hands out de long woids. I could find out where dey're kept dead easy.'  \"What a king of necklaces!\" thought Jimmy.  \"Shall I, Mr. Chames?\"  \"Shall you what?\" asked Jimmy, coming out of his thoughts with a start.  \"Why, find out where de loidy keeps de jools.\"  \"Confound you, Spike! How often am I to tell you that I have done with all that sort of thing forever? I never want to see or touch another stone that doesn't belong to me. I don't want to hear about them. They don't interest me.\"  \"Sorry, Mr. Chames. But dey must cop de limit for fair, dose jools. Two hundred t'ousand plunks! What's dat dis side?\"  \"Forty thousand pounds,\" said Jimmy shortly. \"Now, drop it.\"  \"Yes, Mr. Chames. Can I help youse wit' de duds?\"  \"No, thanks. Spike; I'm through, now. You might just give me a brush down, though, if you don't mind. Not that. That's a hair brush. Try the big black one.\"  \"Dis is a dude suit for fair,\" observed Spike, pausing in his labors.  \"Glad you like it, Spike.\"  \"It's de limit. Excuse me. How much of de long green did youse pungle for it, Mr. Chames?\"  \"I really can't remember,\" said Jimmy, with a laugh. \"I could look up the bill and let you know. Seventy guineas, I fancy.\"  \"What's dat--guineas? Is dat more dan a pound?\"  \"A shilling more. Why?\"  Spike resumed his brushing.  \"What a lot of dude suits youse could get,\" he observed meditatively, \"if youse had dose jools.\"  \"Oh, _curse_ the jewels for the hundredth time!\" snapped Jimmy.  \"Yes, Mr. Chames. But, say, dat must be a boid of a necklace, dat one. You'll be seeing it at de dinner, Mr. Chames.\"  Whatever comment Jimmy might have made on this insidious statement was checked by a sudden bang on the door. Almost simultaneously the handle turned.  \"P'Chee!\" cried Spike. \"It's de cop!\"  Jimmy smiled pleasantly.  \"Come in, Mr. McEachern,\" he said, \"come in. Journeys end in lovers meeting. You know my friend, Mr. Mullins, I think? Shut the door, and sit down and let's talk of many things.\"     CHAPTER VIII.   \"It's a conspiracy!\" thundered Mr. McEachern.  He stood in the doorway, breathing heavily. It has been shown that the ex-policeman was somewhat prone to harbor suspicions of those round about him, and at the present moment his mind was aflame. Indeed, a more trusting man might have been excused for feeling a little doubtful as to the intentions of Jimmy and Spike. When McEachern had heard that his stepson had brought home a casual London acquaintance, he had suspected the existence of hidden motives on the part of the unknown. Spennie, he had told himself, was precisely the sort of youth to whom the professional bunko-steerer would attach himself with shouts of joy. Never, he had assured himself, had there been a softer proposition than his stepson since bunko-steering became a profession.  When he found that the strange visitor was Jimmy Pitt, his suspicions had increased a thousandfold.  And when, going to his dressing room to get ready for dinner, he had nearly run into Spike Mullins, Red Spike of shameful memory, his frame of mind had been that of a man to whom a sudden ray of light reveals the fact that he is on the very brink of a black precipice. Jimmy and Spike had been a firm in New York. And here they were, together again, in his house in Shropshire. To say that the thing struck McEachern as sinister is to put the matter baldly. There was once a gentleman who remarked that he smelt a rat and saw it floating in the air. Ex-constable McEachern smelt a regiment of rats, and the air seemed to him positively congested with them.  His first impulse had been to rush to Jimmy's room there and then; but Lady Jane had trained him well. Though the heavens might fall, he must not be late for dinner. So he went and dressed, and an obstinate tie put the finishing touches to his wrath.  Jimmy regarded him coolly, without moving from the chair in which he had seated himself. Spike, on the other hand, seemed embarrassed. He stood first on one leg and then on the other, as if he were testing the respective merits of each, and would make a definite choice later on.  \"Ye scoundrels!\" growled McEachern.  Spike, who had been standing for a few moments on his right leg, and seemed at last to have come to a decision, hastily changed to the left, and grinned feebly.  \"Say, youse won't want me any more, Mr. Chames?\" he whispered.  \"No; you can go, Spike.\"  \"Ye stay where y'are, ye red-headed limb.\"  \"Run along, Spike!\" said Jimmy.  The Bowery boy looked doubtfully at the huge form of the ex-policeman, which blocked access to the door.  \"Would you mind letting my man pass?\" said Jimmy.  \"Ye stay----\" began McEachern.  Jimmy got up, and walked round him to the door, which he opened. Spike shot out like a rabbit released from a trap. He was not lacking in courage, but he disliked embarrassing interviews, and it struck him that Mr. Chames was the man to handle a situation of this kind. He felt that he himself would only be in the way.  \"Now we can talk comfortably,\" said Jimmy, going back to his chair.  McEachern's deep-set eyes gleamed, and his forehead grew red; but he mastered his feelings.  \"An' now,\" said he, \"perhaps ye'll explain!\"  \"What exactly?\" asked Jimmy.  \"What ye're doin' here.\"  \"Nothing at the moment.\"  \"Ye know what I mane. Why are ye here, you and that red-headed devil?\"  He jerked his head in the direction of the door.  \"I am here because I was very kindly invited to come by your stepson.\"  \"I know ye.\"  \"You have that privilege.\"  \"I know ye, I say, and I want to know what ye're here to do.\"  \"To do? Well, I shall potter about the garden, don't you know, and smell the roses, and look at the horses, and feed the chickens, and perhaps go for an occasional row on the lake. Nothing more. Oh, yes, I believe they want me to act in these theatricals.\"  \"An' I'll tell ye another thing ye'll be wanted to do, and that is to go away from here at wance!\"  \"My dear old sir!\"  \"Ye hear me? At wance.\"  \"Couldn't think of it,\" said Jimmy decidedly. \"Not for a moment.\"  \"I'll expose ye,\" stormed McEachern. \"I'll expose ye. Will ye deny that ye was a crook in New York?\"  \"What proofs have you?\"  \"Proofs! Will you deny it?\"  \"No. It's quite true.\"  \"I knew it.\"  \"But I'm a reformed character, now, Mr. McEachern. I have money of my own. It was left me. I hear you had money left you, too.\"  \"I did,\" said McEachern shortly.  \"Congratulate you. I'm glad I know, because otherwise I might have formed quite a wrong impression when I came here and found you with money to burn. Quite the old English squire now, Mr. McEachern, what?\"  \"Ye'll lave the house to-morrow.\"  \"All the more reason why we should make the most of this opportunity of talking over old times. Did you mind leaving the force?\"  \"And ye'll take that blackguard Mullins wid ye.\"  \"Judging from the stories one hears, it must be a jolly sort of life. What a pity so many of them go in for graft. I could tell you some stories about a policeman I used to know in New York. He was the champion grafter. I remember hearing one yarn from a newspaper man out there. This reporter chap happened to hear of the grumblings of some tenants of an apartment house uptown which led them to believe that certain noises they complained of were made by burglars who used the flat as a place to pack up the loot for shipment to other cities. You know that habit of ours, don't you? He was quite right, and when he tipped off his newspaper they reported the thing to the police. Now, I could have gone right up and made those men show up their hands by merely asking them to.  \"Not so the police. I wonder if you remember the case. You look as if you were beginning to. The police went blundering at wrong doors, and most of the gang got away. And while they were in the house after the raid a woman was able to slip in and take away on an express wagon the three trunks which were to have been held for evidence. And that's not all, either. There was one particular policeman who held the case for the prosecution in his hands. If he had played up in court next day, the one man that had been captured would have got all that was coming to him. What happened? Why, his evidence broke down, and the man was discharged. It's a long story. I hope it hasn't bored you.\"  McEachern did not look bored. He was mopping his forehead, and breathing quickly.  \"It was a most interesting case,\" said Jimmy. \"I've got all the names.\"  \"It's a lie!\"  \"Not at all. True as anything. Ever heard of that policeman--I've got his name, too--who made a lot of money by getting appointments in the force for men of his acquaintance? He used to be paid heavily for it, and you'd hardly believe what a lot of scoundrels he let in in that way.\"  \"See here----\" began McEachern huskily.  \"I wonder if you ever came across any men in the force who made anything by that dodge of arresting a person and then getting a lawyer for them. Ever heard of that? It's rather like a double ruff at bridge. You--I'm awfully sorry. I shouldn't have used that word. What I meant to say was the policeman makes his arrest, then suggests that the person had better have a bondsman. He gathers in a bondsman, who charges the prisoner four dollars for bailing him out. Two dollars of this goes to the sergeant, who accepts the bail without question, and the policeman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8931"],["title","The Gem Collector (#8)"],["body"," one. Then the able and intelligent officer says to the prisoner: 'What you want is a lawyer.' 'Right,' says the prisoner, 'if you think so.' Off goes the policeman and gets the lawyer. Five more dollars, of which he gets his share. It's a beautiful system. It might interest the people at dinner to-night to hear about it. I think I'll tell them.\"  \"You'll----\"  \"And when you come to think that some policemen in New York take tribute from peddlers who obstruct the traffic, tradesmen who obstruct the sidewalk, restaurant keepers who keep open after one o'clock in the morning, drivers who exceed speed limits, and keepers of pool rooms, you'll understand that there's a good bit to be made out of graft, if you go in for it seriously. It's uncommonly lucky, McEachern, that you were left that money. Otherwise you might have been tempted, mightn't you?\"  There was a somewhat breathless silence in the room. Mr. McEachern was panting slightly.  \"You couldn't reconsider your decision about sending me away to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Jimmy, flicking at his shoes with a handkerchief. \"It's a lovely part of the country, this. I would be sorry to leave it.\"  Mr. McEachern's brain was working with unwonted rapidity. This man must be silenced at all costs. It would be fatal to his prospects in English society if one tithe of these gruesome stories were made public. And he believed Jimmy capable of making them public, being guilty thereby of an error of judgment. Jimmy, though he had no respect at all for Mr. McEachern, would have died sooner than spread any story which, even in an indirect way, could reflect upon Molly. Mr. McEachern, however, had not the advantage of knowing his antagonist's feelings, and the bluff was successful.  \"Ye can stay,\" he said.  \"Thanks,\" said Jimmy.  \"And I'll beg ye not to mention the force at dinner or at any other time.\"  \"I won't dream of it.\"  \"They think I made me money on Wall Street.\"  \"It would have been a slower job there. You were wise in your choice. Shall we go down to the drawing-room, now?\"  \"Ye say y'are rich yerself,\" said McEachern.  \"Very,\" said Jimmy, \"so don't you worry yourself, my Wall Street speculator.\"  Mr. McEachern did not worry himself. He had just recollected that in a very short time he would have a trained detective on the premises. Any looking after that James Willoughby Pitt might require might safely be left in the hands of this expert.     CHAPTER IX.   It was at dinner that Jimmy had his first chance of seeing the rope of pearls which had so stimulated the roving fancy of Spike Mullins. Lady Blunt sat almost opposite to him. Her dress was of unrelieved black, and formed a wonderfully effective foil to the gems. It was not a rope of pearls. It was a collar. Her neck was covered with them. There was something Oriental and barbaric in the overwhelming display of jewelry. And this suggestion of the East was emphasized by the wearer's regal carriage. Lady Blunt knew when she looked well. She did not hold herself like one apologizing for venturing to exist.  Jimmy stared hungrily across the table. The room was empty to him but for that gleaming mass of gems. He breathed softly and quickly through clinched teeth.  \"Jimmy!\" whispered a voice.  It seemed infinitely remote.  A hand shook his elbow gently. He started.  \"_Don't_ stare like that, _please_. What is the matter?\"  Molly, seated at his side, was looking at him wide-eyed. Jimmy smiled with an effort. Every nerve in his body seemed to be writhing.  \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I'm only hungry. I always look like that at the beginning of a meal.\"  \"Well, here comes Keggs with some soup for you. You'd better not waste another moment. You looked perfectly awful.\"  \"No!\"  \"Like a starved wolf.\"  \"You must look after me,\" said Jimmy, \"see that the wolf's properly fed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The conversation, becoming general with the fish, was not of a kind to remove from Jimmy's mind the impression made by the sight of the pearls. It turned on crime in general and burglary in particular.  Spennie began it.  \"Oh, I say,\" he said, \"I forgot to tell you, mother. Number Six was burgled the other night.\"  Number Six-a, Easton Square, was the family's London house.  \"Burgled!\"  \"Well, broken into,\" said Spennie, gratified to find that he had got the ear of his entire audience. Even Lady Blunt was silent and attentive. \"Chap got in through the scullery window about one o'clock, in the morning. It was the night after you dined with me, Pitt.\"  \"And what did our Spennie do?\" inquired Sir Thomas.  \"Oh, I--er--I was out at the time,\" said Spennie. \"But something frightened the feller,\" he went on hurriedly, \"and he made a bolt for it without taking anything.\"  Jimmy, looking down the table, became conscious that his host's eye was fixed gloomily upon him. He knew intuitively what was passing in McEachern's mind. The ex-policeman was feeling that his worst suspicions had been confirmed. Jimmy had dined with Spennie--obviously a mere excuse for spying out the land; and the very next night the house had been burgled. Once more Mr. McEachern congratulated himself on his astuteness in engaging the detective from Wragge's Agency. With Jimmy above stairs and Spike Mullins below, that sleuthhound would have his hands full.  \"Burglary,\" said Wesson, leaning back and taking advantage of a pause, \"is the hobby of the sportsman and the life work of the avaricious.\"  Everybody seemed to have something to say on the subject. One young lady gave it as her opinion that she would not like to find a burglar under her bed. Somebody else had known a man whose father had fired at the butler, under the impression that he was a housebreaker, and had broken a valuable bust of Socrates. Spennie knew a man at Oxford whose brother wrote lyrics for musical comedy, and had done one about a burglar's best friend being his mother.  \"Life,\" said Wesson, who had had time for reflection, \"is a house which we all burgle. We enter it uninvited, take all that we can lay hands on, and go out again.\"  \"This man's brother I was telling you about,\" said Spennie, \"says there's only one rhyme in the English language to 'burglar', and that's 'gurgler'. Unless you count 'pergola', he says----\"  \"Personally,\" said Jimmy, with a glance at McEachern, \"I have rather a sympathy for burglars. After all, they are one of the hardest-working classes in existence. They toil while everybody else is asleep. They are generally thorough sportsmen. Besides, a burglar is only a practical socialist. Philosophers talk a lot about the redistribution of wealth. The burglar goes out and does it. I have found burglars some of the decentest criminals I have ever met. Out of business hours they are charming.\"  \"I despise burglars!\" ejaculated Lady Blunt, with a suddenness which stopped Jimmy's eloquence as if a tap had been turned off. \"If I found one coming after my jewels and I had a gun handy, I'd shoot him. I would.\"  \"My dear Julia!\" said Lady Jane. \"Why suggest such dreadful things? At any rate, this house has never been burgled, and I don't think it's likely to be.\"  \"Beroofen!\" said Jimmy, touching the back of his chair. As he did so, he met McEachern's eye, and smiled kindly at him. The ex-policeman was looking at him with the gaze of a baffled but malignant basilisk.  \"I take very good care no one gets a chance at my jewels,\" said Lady Blunt. \"I've had a steel box made for me with a special lock which would drive the cunningest burglar on this earth mad before he'd been at it ten minutes. It would. He'd go right away and reform.\"  Jimmy's lips closed tightly, and a combative look came into his eye at this unconscious challenge. This woman was too aggressively confident. A small lesson. He could return the jewels by post. It would give her a much-needed jolt.  Then he pulled himself up.  \"James, my boy,\" he said to himself, with severity, \"this is hypocrisy. You know perfectly well that is not why you want those pearls. Don't try and bluff yourself, because it won't do.\"  The conversation turned to other topics. Jimmy was glad of it. He wanted to think this thing over.  From where he sat, he had an excellent view of the rope of pearls which was tugging him back to his old ways. And when he looked at them he could not see Molly. The thing was symbolical. It must be one or the other. He was at the crossroads. The affair was becoming a civil war. He felt like a rudderless boat between two currents. Eight years of gem collecting do not leave a man without a deep-rooted passion for the sport. As for that steel box, that was all nonsense. It was probably quite a good steel box, and the lock might very well be something out of the ordinary; but it could not be a harder job than some of those he had tackled.  The pearls shone in the lamplight. They seemed to be winking at him.     CHAPTER X.   In a cozy corner of the electric flame department of the infernal regions there stands a little silver gridiron. It is the private property of his Satanic majesty, and is reserved exclusively for the man who invented amateur theatricals. It is hard to see why the amateur actor has been allowed to work his will unchecked for so long. These performances of his are diametrically opposed to the true sport of civilization, which insists that the good of the many should be considered as being of more importance than that of the few.  In the case of amateur theatricals, a large number of inoffensive people are annoyed simply in order that a mere handful of acquaintances may amuse themselves. Usually the whole thing can be laid at the door of the man, the organizer. He is the serpent in the Eden. Before his arrival, the house party were completely happy, and asked for nothing else but to be left alone. Then he arrives. At breakfast on his first morning, he strikes the first blow--casually helping himself to scrambled eggs the while, with the air of a man uttering some agreeable commonplace. \"I say,\""]]]
