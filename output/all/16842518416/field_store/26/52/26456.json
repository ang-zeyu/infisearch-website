We may affirm the same thing of each part of each  individual composing the human body; therefore, the knowledge of each part composing  the human body is in God, in so far as he is affected by very many ideas of things, and not  in so far as he has the idea of the human body only, in other words, the idea which  constitutes the nature of the human mind (II. xiii.); therefore (II. xi. Cor.), the human mind  does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human body.  Q.E.D.  XXV. The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate  knowledge of the external body.  >>>>>Proof--We have shown that the idea of a modification of the human body involves  the nature of an external body, in so far as that external body conditions the human body in  a given manner. But, in so far as the external body is an individual, which has no reference  to the human body, the knowledge or idea thereof is in God (II. ix.), in so far as God is  regarded as affected by the idea of a further thing, which (II. vii.) is naturally prior to the  said external body.  Wherefore an adequate knowledge of the external body is not in God,  in so far as he has the idea of the modification of the human body; in other words, the idea  of the modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the  external body.  Q.E.D.  XXVI. The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing, except  through the ideas of the modifications of its own body.  >>>>>Proof--If the human body is in no way affected by a given external body, then  (II. vii.) neither is the idea of the human body, in other words, the human mind, affected in  any way by the idea of the existence of the said external body, nor does it in any manner  perceive its existence.  But, in so far as the human body is affected in any way by a given  external body, thus far (II. xvi. and Cor.) it perceives that external body.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--In so far as the human mind imagines an external body, it has not an  adequate knowledge thereof.  >>>>>Proof--When the human mind regards external bodies through the ideas of the  modifications of its own body, we say that it imagines (see II. xvii. note); now the mind  can only imagine external bodies as actually existing.  Therefore (by II. xxv.), in so far as  the mind imagines external bodies, it has not an adequate knowledge of them.  Q.E.D.  XXVII. The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate  knowledge of the human body itself.  >>>>>Proof--Every idea of a modification of the human body involves the nature of the  human body, in so far as the human body is regarded as affected in a given manner (II.  xvi.).  But inasmuch as the human body is an individual which may be affected in many  other ways, the idea of the said modification, &c. Q.E.D.  XXVIII. The ideas of the modifications of the human body, in so far as they have  reference only to the human mind, are not clear and distinct, but confused.  >>>>>Proof--The ideas of the modifications of the human body involve the nature both of  the human body and of external bodies (II. xvi.); they must involve the nature not only of  the human body but also of its parts; for the modifications are modes (Post. iii.), whereby  the parts of the human body, and, consequently, the human body as a whole are affected.   But (by II. xxiv., xxv.) the adequate knowledge of external bodies, as also of the parts  composing the human body, is not in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by the  human mind, but in so far as he is regarded as affected by other ideas.  These ideas of  modifications, in so far as they are referred to the human mind alone, are as consequences  without premisses, in other words, confused ideas.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--The idea which constitutes the nature of the human mind is, in the same  manner, proved not to be, when considered in itself and alone, clear and distinct; as also  is the case with the idea of the human mind, and the ideas of the ideas of the modifications  of the human body, in so far as they are referred to the mind only, as everyone may easily  see.  XXIX.  The idea of the idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an  adequate knowledge of the human mind.  >>>>>Proof--The idea of a modification of the human body (II. xxvii.) does not involve  an adequate knowledge of the said body, in other words, does not adequately express its  nature; that is (II. xiii.) it does not agree with the nature of the mind adequately; therefore  (I. Ax. vi.) the idea of this idea does not adequately express the nature of the human mind,  or does not involve an adequate knowledge thereof.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows that the human mind, when it perceives things after the  common order of nature, has not an adequate but only a confused and fragmentary  knowledge of itself, of its own body, and of external bodies.  For the mind does not know  itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of body (II. xxiii.).  It  only perceives its own body (II. xix.) through the ideas of the modifications of body (II.  xxiii.).  It only perceives its own body (II. xix.) through the ideas of the modifications, and  only perceives external bodies through the same means; thus, in so far as it has such ideas  of modification, it has not an adequate knowledge of itself (II. xxix.), nor of its own body  (II. xxvii.), nor of external bodies (II. xxv.), but only a fragmentary and confused knowledge thereof (II. xxviii. and note).  Q.E.D.  *****Note--I say expressly, that the mind has not an adequate but only a confused  knowledge of itself, its own body, and of external bodies, whenever it perceives things  after the common order of nature; that is, whenever it is determined from without, namely,  by the fortuitous play of circumstance, to regard this or that; not at such times as it is  determined from within, that is, by the fact of regarding several things at once, to understand their points of agreement, difference, and contrast. Whenever it is determined  in anywise from within, it regards things clearly and distinctly, as I will show below.  XXX. We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body.  >>>>>Proof--The duration of our body does not depend on its essence (II. Ax. i.), nor  on the absolute nature of God (I. xxi.).  But (I. xxviii.) it is conditioned to exist and operate by causes, which in their turn are conditioned to exist and operate in a fixed and definite  relation by other causes, these last again being conditioned by others, and so on to infinity. The duration of our body therefore depends on the common order of nature, or the  constitution of things.  Now, however a thing may be constituted, the adequate knowledge  of that thing is in God, in so far as he has the ideas of all things, and not in so far as he has  the idea of the human body only (II. ix. Cor.). Wherefore the knowledge of the duration  of our body is in God very inadequate, in so far as he is only regarded as constituting the  nature of the human mind; that is (II. xi. Cor.), this knowledge is very inadequate to our  mind.  Q.E.D.  XXXI. We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things  external to ourselves.  >>>>>Proof--Every particular thing, like the human body, must be conditioned by another  particular thing to exist and operate in a fixed and definite relation; this other particular  thing must likewise be conditioned by a third, and so on to infinity (I. xxviii.).  As we have  shown in the foregoing proposition, from this common property of particular things, we  have only a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body; we must draw a similar conclusion with regard to the duration of particular things, namely, that we can only  have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration thereof.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows that all particular things are contingent and perishable.   For we can have no adequate idea of their duration (by the last Prop.), and this is what we  must understand by the contingency and perishableness of things (I. xxxiii., Note i.).  For  (I. xxix.), except in this sense, nothing is contingent.  XXXII. All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God, are true.  >>>>>Proof--All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with their objects (II. ii.  Cor.), therefore (I. Ax. vi.) they are all true.  Q.E.D.  XXXII. There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them to be called false.  >>>>>Proof--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, a positive mode of thinking, which  should constitute the distinctive quality of falsehood.  Such a mode of thinking cannot be  in God (II. xxxii.); external to God it cannot be or be conceived (I. xv.).  Therefore there  is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to be called false.  Q.E.D.  XXXIV. Every idea, which in us is absolute or adequate and perfect, is true.  >>>>>Proof--When we say that an idea in us is adequate and perfect, we say, in other  words (II. xi. Cor.), that the idea is adequate and perfect in God, in so far as he constitutes  the essence of our mind; consequently (II. xxxii.), we say that such an idea is true.  Q.E.D.  XXXV. Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or  confused ideas involve.  >>>>>Proof--There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them to be called false (II.  xxxiii.); but falsity cannot consist in simple privation (for minds, not bodies, are said to err  and to be mistaken), neither can it consist in absolute ignorance, for ignorance and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/920"],["title","Ethics â€” Part 2 (#6)"],["body","are not identical; wherefore it consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate,  fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--In the note to II. xvii. I explained how error consists in the privation of  knowledge, but in order to throw more light on the subject I will give an example.  For  instance, men are mistaken in thinking themselves free; their opinion is made up of  consciousness of their own actions, and ignorance of the causes by which they are  conditioned.  Their idea of freedom, therefore, is simply their ignorance of any cause for their actions.  As for their saying that human actions depend on the will, this is a mere  phrase without any idea to correspond thereto.  What the will is, and how it moves the  body, they none of them know; those who boast of such knowledge, and feign dwellings  and habitations for the soul, are wont to provoke either laughter or disgust.  So, again,  when we look at the sun, we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet; this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact that, while we thus imagine, we  do not know the sun's true distance or the cause of the fancy.  For although we afterwards learn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of the earth's diameters, we  none the less shall fancy it to be near; for we do not imagine the sun as near us, because  we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of our body involves the  essence of the sun, in so far as our said body is affected thereby.  XXXVI. Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or  clear and distinct ideas.  >>>>>Proof--All ideas are in God (I. xv.), and in so far as they are referred to God are  true (II. xxxii.) and (II. vii. Cor.) adequate; therefore there are no ideas confused or  inadequate, except in respect to a particular mind (cf. II. xxiv. and xxviii.); therefore all  ideas, whether adequate or inadequate, follow by the same necessity (II. vi.).  Q.E.D.  XXXVII. That which is common to all (cf. Lemma II, above), and which is equally in a  part and in the whole, does not constitute the essence of any particular thing.  >>>>>Proof--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that it constitutes the essence of some  particular thing; for instance, the essence of B.  Then (II. Def. ii.) it cannot without B either exist or be conceived; but this is against our hypothesis. Therefore it does not  appertain to B's essence, nor does it constitute the essence of any particular thing.  Q.E.D.  XXXVIII. Those things, which are common to all, and which are equally in a part and in  the whole, cannot be conceived except adequately.  >>>>>Proof--Let A be something, which is common to all bodies, and which is equally  present in the part of any given body and in the whole.  I say A cannot be conceived except  adequately. For the idea thereof in God will necessarily be adequate (II. vii. Cor.), both in  so far as God has the idea of the human body, and also in so far as he has the idea of the  modifications of the human body, which (II. xvi., xxv., xxvii.) involve in part the nature of  the human body and the nature of external bodies; that is (II. xii., xiii.), the idea in God will  necessarily be adequate, both in so far as he constitutes the human mind, and in so far as  he has the ideas, which are in the human mind. Therefore the mind (II. xi. Cor.)  necessarily perceives A adequately, and has this adequate perception, both in so far as it  perceives itself, and in so far as it perceives its own or any external body, nor can A be  conceived in any other manner. Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows that there are certain ideas or notions common to all  men; for (by Lemma ii.) all bodies agree in certain respects, which (by the foregoing Prop.)  must be adequately or clearly and distinctly perceived by all.  XXXIX. That, which is common to and a property of the human body and such other  bodies as are wont to affect the human body, and which is present equally in each part of  either, or in the whole, will be represented by an adequate idea in the mind.  >>>>>Proof--If A be that, which is common to and a property of the human body and  external bodies, and equally present in the human body and in the said external bodies, in  each part of each external body and in the whole, there will be an adequate idea of A in  God (II. vii. Cor.), both in so far as he has the idea of the human body, and in so far as he  has the ideas of the given external bodies.  Let it now be granted, that the human body is affected by an external body through that, which it has in common therewith, namely, A;  the idea of this modification will involve the property A (II. xvi.), and therefore (II. vii.  Cor.) the idea of this modification, in so far as it involves the property A, will be adequate  in God, in so far as God is affected by the idea of the human body; that is (II. xiii.), in so  far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore (II. xi. Cor.) this idea is also  adequate in the human mind.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows that the mind is fitted to perceive adequately more  things, in proportion as its body has more in common with other bodies.  XL. Whatsoever ideas in the mind follow from ideas which are therein adequate, are also  themselves adequate.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is self-evident.  For when we say that an idea in the human  mind follows from ideas which are therein adequate, we say, in other words (II. xi. Cor.),  that an idea is in the divine intellect, whereof God is the cause, not in so far as he is  infinite, nor in so far as he is affected by the ideas of very many particular things, but only  in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind.  *****Note I--I have thus set forth the cause of those notions, which are common to all  men, and which form the basis of our ratiocinations.  But there are other causes of certain  axioms or notions, which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this method of ours; for  it would thus appear what notions are more useful than others, and what notions have  scarcely any use at all.  Furthermore, we should see what notions are common to all men,  and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who are unshackled by prejudice, and  we should detect those which are ill-founded.  Again we should discern whence the notions called \"secondary\" derived their origin, and consequently the axioms on which they are  founded, and other points of interest connected with these questions.  But I have decided  to pass over the subject here, partly because I have set it aside for another treatise, partly  because I am afraid of wearying the reader by too great prolixity.  Nevertheless, in order  not to omit anything necessary to be known, I will briefly set down the causes, whence are  derived the terms styled \"transcendental,\" such as Being, Thing, Something.  These terms  arose from the fact, that the human body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly  forming a certain number of images (what an image is I explained in the II. xvii. note)  within itself at the same time; if this number be exceeded, the images will begin to be confused; if this number of images, of which the body is capable of forming distinctly  within itself, be largely exceeded, all will become entirely confused one with another.  This  being so, it is evident (from II. Prop. xvii. Cor., and xviii.) that the human mind can  distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body can form images  simultaneously.  When the images become quite confused in the body, the mind also  imagines all bodies confusedly without any distinction, and will comprehend them, as it  were, under one attribute, namely, under the attribute of Being, Thing, &c.  The same  conclusion can be drawn from the fact that images are not always equally vivid, and from other analogous causes, which there is no need to explain here; for the purpose which we  have in view it is sufficient for us to consider one only.  All may be reduced to this, that  these terms represent ideas in the highest degree confused.  From similar causes arise those  notions, which we call \"general,\" such as man, horse, dog, &c.  They arise, to wit, from  the fact that so many images, for instance, of men, are formed simultaneously in the  human mind, that the powers of imagination break down, not indeed utterly, but to the  extent of the mind losing count of small differences between individuals (e.g. colour, size,  &c.) and their definite number, and only distinctly imagining that, in which all the  individuals, in so far as the body is affected by them, agree; for that is the point, in which  each of the said individuals chiefly affected the body; this the mind expresses by the name  man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of particular individuals.  For, as we have  said, it is unable to imagine the definite number of individuals.  We must, however, bear in  mind, that these general notions are not formed by all men in the same way, but vary in  each individual according as the point varies, whereby the body has been most often  affected and which the mind most easily imagines or remembers.  For instance, those who  have most often regarded with admiration the stature of man, will by the name of man  understand an animal of erect stature; those who have been accustomed to regard some other attribute, will form a different general image of man, for instance, that man is a  laughing animal, a two-footed animal without feathers, a rational animal, and thus, in other  cases, everyone will form general images of things according to the habit of his body.  It is thus not to be wondered at, that among philosophers, who seek to explain things in  nature merely by the images formed of them, so many controversies should have arisen.  *****Note II--From all that has been said above it is "]]]
