Perhaps some of Trevillo's relations will come forward, in good time, and they can be asked to do something for the child.\"  \"Relations!\" said the grandmother with a sigh. \"That cousin is a relation, and little enough of comfort he gets from her in the course of the year.\"  The schoolmaster rose with difficulty from his seat. \"I am going down-hill, neighbor,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I cannot imagine where my strength has gone to.\"  The old woman encouraged him, and said he was still a young man in comparison with her. But, in truth, it did surprise her to see how slowly and painfully he walked as he left her.     CHAPTER VII.  A PRECIOUS LEGACY, AND A PRECIOUS PRAYER.   Many beautiful Sundays followed; and, whenever it was possible, the grandmother so arranged it that Stineli got, now and then, a spare moment; but the work in the house increased daily. Rico passed many hours standing on the threshold of his cottage looking longingly across the way, in the hope of seeing Stineli come out.  Towards September, when people often sat before their houses in order to enjoy, to the utmost, the last warm evenings of the season, the schoolmaster placed himself before his door, but he looked very thin and coughed continually; and at last, one morning when he tried to rise, his strength deserted him completely, and he fell back upon his pillow.  There he lay very still, and busy with all sorts of thoughts; and he wondered what would come to pass when he died. He had no children, and his wife had been dead for a long time, and there was only an old maid-servant to live with him and take care of the house. He was principally occupied in thinking of what would become of all the things that belonged to him when he should be gone; and, as his fiddle hung directly opposite to him on the wall, he said to himself, \"I must leave that behind me too.\"  Then he remembered the day when Rico stood before him and played on the instrument, and he felt as if he had rather let the boy have the fiddle than to let it go to a distant cousin who did not understand the use of it at all. And he thought that, if it were to go very cheap, perhaps Rico could buy it. Presently he bethought himself that if he could not use the violin, neither would he have any use for money. For all that, he could not bring himself to let the instrument, for which he had paid down six hard gulden, go for nothing.  So he pondered and pondered how he could manage to obtain something in exchange; but at last it was quite clear to him that there, where he was fast going, he could not take his violin with him, neither could he take any thing that he might get for it, for all must remain behind.  While he was lying there the fever became greater and greater, and he lay, towards evening and all night long, fighting with all sorts of strange thoughts, and old, long-forgotten events rose before his mind and perplexed him; so that at last, towards morning, he lay on his bed utterly exhausted, and with only one thought or wish,--viz., to be able to do one kind deed, one good action, and that quickly, before it was too late. He knocked against the wall with his stick until the old maid-servant heard him and came in to him; and then he sent her over to the grandmother, to ask her to come to him as quickly as possible.  She did come almost immediately; and before she had fairly time to ask him how he found himself, he said,--  \"Will you be so good as to take down the fiddle that hangs there on the wall, and give it to the little orphan boy? I wish to make him a present of it, and he must be very careful of it.\"  Naturally the good woman was very much surprised, and could not refrain from exclaiming repeatedly, \"What will Rico do with it? What will Rico say to this?\" Presently she noticed, however, that the schoolmaster seemed a little restless, as if he were in a hurry to have the thing done.  So she left him, and hastened as quickly as possible across the fields with the gift under her arm; for she was also impatient to know how Rico would take this rare piece of good fortune.  He was standing in the doorway of his cottage. At a motion from the grandmother, he ran towards her.  \"Here, Rico,\" she said, and handed him the violin. \"The schoolmaster sends this to you: it is yours.\"  The boy stood as if he were in a dream, but it was true. The grandmother was really standing there, holding the fiddle out to him.  Trembling with pleasure and excitement, he took his present at last, put it on his arm, and gazed at it in a silly sort of way, as if he thought it might vanish presently, as quickly as it had come, if he did not keep his eyes on it.  \"You must be very careful of it,\" said the old woman, delivering her message faithfully. She was much inclined to laugh, however; for it did not seem to her that the warning was at all necessary. \"And, Rico, think about the teacher, and do not forget what he has done for you: he is very ill.\"  The grandmother went into the house with these words; and the boy hastened up into his own bedroom, where he was always alone.  There he sat and fiddled, and played on and on, and forgot all about eating or drinking, or how the time sped on. At last, when it was almost dark, he came to himself, and went down-stairs. The cousin came out from the kitchen, saying, \"You can have something to eat to-morrow morning. You have behaved so to-day that you won't get any thing more.\"  The boy did not feel hungry, although he had not eaten since the early morning, and went quite unconsciously across into the opposite house, and entered the kitchen. He was looking for the grandmother.  Stineli was standing by the hearth, arranging the fire. When she caught sight of Rico, she shouted aloud for joy; for the ground had almost burned beneath her feet, she had been so impatient all day--ever since her grandmother had told her the great news--to get away, and express her delight to Rico; but she had not dared to leave the house for an instant. Now she was fairly beside herself, and called out, again and again, \"You have got it now! You have got it now!\"  Hearing the noise, the grandmother came out of the sitting-room; and Rico hastened towards her, saying, \"May I go to thank the teacher, if he is sick?\"  After thinking a while,--for she remembered how very ill the schoolmaster looked in the morning when she saw him,--the good woman said, \"Wait a few moments, Rico, I will go with you;\" and stepped into her room to put on a clean apron. Then they went over to the schoolhouse. The grandmother entered first. Rico followed, his fiddle under his arm. He had not once laid it down since it had come into his possession.  The teacher lay on his bed, looking very feeble indeed. The lad stepped to the bedside and looked down at his fiddle and could scarcely speak, but his eyes sparkled so brightly that the good man had no difficulty in understanding him: he cast a pleased look towards the boy, and nodded at him. Then he beckoned the grandmother to draw near. Rico moved a little to one side, and the teacher said with a weak voice, \"Grandmother, I should be very glad if you would say 'Our Father' for me, I feel so very much troubled.\"  Just at this moment the prayer-bell sounded. The grandmother folded her hands and repeated the Lord's Prayer, and Rico also folded his hands. Every thing was quiet in the room. After a while the grandmother bent over and closed the old teacher's eyes, for he had passed away. Then she took Rico by the hand, and went softly home with him.     CHAPTER VIII.  ON THE LAKE OF SILS.   Stineli did not recover herself during the entire week, her joy was so great; but it seemed as if that week were ten days longer than any other, for Sunday seemed never to come.  At last it did come, and a golden sun shone over the harvest fields, and she and Rico went up under the fir-trees, where the sparkling lake lay spread out at their feet; and the girl's heart was so overflowing with happiness, that she had to dance about and shout aloud before she seated herself on the moss, on the very edge of the slope. There she could see every thing round about,--the sunny heights and the lake, and, stretched over all, the blue heavens.  Suddenly she called out, \"Come now, Rico; we will sing,--sing for ever so long.\"  So the lad seated himself by Stineli's side, and placed his fiddle in position,--for he had, of course, brought that too,--and began to play, and the children sang,--    \"Little lambkins, come down   From the bright, sunny height,\"  until they had sung all the verses; but Stineli had not had half enough.  \"We will sing more,\" she said, and went on,--    \"Little lambkins, above   On the bright, pleasant hill,   The sunlight is sparkling,   The winds are not still.\"  And then Rico sang the verse and was pleased and said, \"Sing some more.\"  Stineli was quite excited: thought a bit, and looked up, then down, and sang again,--    \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins,   And the heavens so blue;   And red and white flowers,   And the green grasses, too.\"  Then Rico fiddled and sung the verse with her, and said again, \"Some more.\"  Stineli laughed, and, glancing at Rico, sang,--    \"And a sad little boy,     And a very gay maid;   And a lake like another,     That from water is made.\"  Laughing and singing, Stineli went on,--    \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins,     They jumped up so high,   And all were most merry,     And did not know why.    \"And a boy and a girl     By the lake-side did sit,   And because they forgot it,     It hurt not a bit.\"  Now they began at the very beginning, and sang the whole thing through again, and made merry over it, and were so happy that they sang it at least ten times over; and the more they repeated it, the better it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9075"],["title","Rico and Wiseli (#5)"],["body","to their ears.  After this Rico played several tunes that he had learned from his father; but they soon came back to their own song, and began that again.  In the midst of it the girl stopped and said, \"It has just come into my head how you can go down to the other lake, and will not need any money either.\"  Rico paused suddenly and gazed at his companion, awaiting what was coming next.  \"Don't you see,\" she said earnestly, \"now you have a fiddle, and you know a song. You can go and play your song, and sing before the taverns; then the people will give you something to eat and to drink, and let you sleep there, for they will see that you are not a beggar. So you can go on until you reach the lake; and, coming home, you can do the same thing again.\"  Rico reflected over these words, but Stineli would give him no time for dreaming: she wanted to go on with the song.  They made so much noise themselves, that they did not hear the prayer-bell at all; and did not notice what time it was until reminded by the growing darkness, and perceived the grandmother looking about anxiously for them before they reached the houses.  But Stineli was too much excited to be subdued by any thing. She ran on towards her grandmother, and said, \"You have no idea how beautifully Rico can fiddle; and we have made a song of our own, for ourselves only. We will sing it to you this very moment.\"  And before there was time to answer, they began and sang it all through; and the good grandmother listened with real pleasure to their sweet, clear voices.  She seated herself on the log; and, when the children had finished, said, \"Come now, Rico, I want you to play for me; and you and I will sing together. Do you know the song that begins,--    \"'I sing to thee with heart and voice?'\"  Rico had probably heard the hymn, but he did not know it correctly, and said that he wished first to hear it from the grandmother, and he would follow her softly on his violin, and then he would be sure of it.  So they began; and first the grandmother repeated the words of a verse to the children, and then they all sang it together,--    \"I sing to thee with heart and voice,     Lord, whom my soul obeys.   I sing, and bid all earth rejoice:     Thou teachest me thy praise.    \"I know that thou the fountain art     Of joy,--the eternal spring   Which, into every willing heart,     Healing and good dost bring.    \"Why do we worry over sin?     Why sorrow night and day?   Come, bring thy load, cast it on Him     Who fashioned thee from clay.    \"He never yet has done amiss;     And, perfect in His sight,   All that He does or orders is     Sure to be finished right.    \"Now only let His will be done,     Nor clamor constantly,   Peace to thy heart on earth will come,     And joy eternally.\"  \"It is well,\" said the grandmother. \"Now we know a proper evening hymn, and you may go quickly to rest, my children.\"     CHAPTER IX.  A PERPLEXING AFFAIR.   When Rico entered the cottage that evening it was later than usual, for he had spent a full half-hour in singing the hymn. As he went in, his cousin came flying towards him.  \"Are you beginning in this style already?\" she called out. \"The supper stood waiting for you a whole hour: now I have put it away. Go to your bedroom; and if you turn out a good-for-nothing and a scamp, it is no fault of mine. I don't know any thing that I had not rather do than look after a boy like you.\"  Rico never answered a single word, no matter how much his cousin might scold at him; but this evening he looked at her, and said,--  \"I can get out of your way, cousin.\"  She shoved the bolt in on the house-door with such violence that the door shook, and went into the sitting-room, slamming that door behind her. Rico went up into his dark little bedroom.  On the following day, as all the big family in the other cottage were eating their supper,--the parents, the grandmother, and all the children,--the cousin came running over, and called out from the door to ask if they knew any thing about Rico: she had no idea where he could be.  \"He will come fast enough when it is time for supper,\" replied the father quietly.  The cousin entered the room. She had been quite sure that the lad was there, and she expected him to come out if she only stood at the door and asked for him.  Now she went on to tell them that he had not made his appearance at breakfast, nor at dinner-time, and that he had not been in bed the previous night, for she had found it as she had left it; and she believed that he must have gone away very early in the morning before daybreak, wandering about as he was in the habit of doing, for the bolt was pushed aside on the house-door when she went to open it. She thought at first that she must have forgotten to bolt it the night before in her anger, for nobody knew how angry she had been.  \"Something has happened to him,\" said the father, quite unmoved. \"He has probably fallen into some cleft up there on the mountain: it often happens to little boys who go climbing about everywhere.  \"You ought to have spoken of it earlier in the day,\" he went on slowly. \"We shall have to go to look for him, and in the night you can't see any thing.\"  At these words the cousin broke out into a terrible uproar. She expected there would be all sorts of fault found with her; that was always the way when you had suffered for years, and never said any thing about it.  \"Nobody would ever believe,\" she said,--and spoke a truthful word then, at least,--\"what a sly, cunning, deceitful boy that is, and what a life he has led me these four years. He will turn out a regular vagabond, a tramp, a disgraceful creature.\"  The grandmother had ceased eating for several minutes. She now rose from the table, and went up to the cousin, who was talking very noisily.  \"Stop, neighbor, stop,\" she said; and repeated it twice without effect. \"I know Rico very well; I have always known him ever since he was brought here to his grandmother. If I were in your place, I would not say another word, but stop to think whether the lad, to whom perhaps something dreadful has happened, and who may be standing up there before God at this moment, may not have some complaint against somebody,--somebody who had done him a heavy injury, all deserted as he is, with her cruel words.\"  Since Rico's disappearance, the way the lad looked at her on that last evening had occurred several times to the cousin's mind, and how he said,--  \"I can easily get out of your way.\"  That was why she had made such a noise about it, in order to drown these words. Now she did not dare to look the grandmother in the face, but said that she must go: perhaps Rico might be at the cottage by this time, which she would very gladly have had come true.  From this day forward the cousin never spoke another word against Rico in the grandmother's hearing; nor, indeed, did she often speak of him at all. She believed, as did all the neighbors far and near, that the lad was dead; and she was thankful that nobody knew about the words he had said to her on that last evening.  The next morning after this event was made known, Stineli's father went out to the thrashing-floor and picked himself out a stout stick. He said that he would call some of the neighbors together: they must go search for the lad somewhere towards the glaciers and up by the ravines.  Stineli crept out after him, and he said, when he noticed her, \"That is right, come and help me to search; you can get into the corners better than I can.\"  At last, after they had found a big beanpole, Stineli ventured to say, \"But father, if Rico went along the high-road, then he could not fall into any thing, could he?\"  \"Oh, perhaps he might,\" replied her father. \"Such thoughtless boys as he often stray off the road, and fall into ravines and places: they don't know themselves where they are going, and he was always moving about more or less.\"  That this was true of Rico nobody knew better than Stineli; and she became dreadfully anxious from that time forth, which anxiety increased every day to such a degree that she could neither eat nor sleep for sorrow, and did her work, day after day, as if she did not know what she was about.  Rico was not found: nobody had seen any thing of him. They ceased to search for him, and the folks soon began to find consolation in the thought, \"It is just as well for the little fellow, after all; he was forsaken, and had no one to care for him.\"     CHAPTER X.  A LITTLE LIGHT.   Stineli grew more and more thin and quiet from day to day. The little ones called out complainingly, \"Stineli never tells us stories now, and never laughs any more.\" Her mother said to her father, \"Do you notice how changed she is?\" And her father replied, \"It is because she grows so fast. She must get a little goat's milk early in the mornings.\"  After this had gone on for three weeks or so, Stineli's grandmother called the girl into her bedroom one evening, and said, \"My dear Stineli, I can very well understand that you cannot forget your friend Rico, but you must try to remember that it is God's will that he should be taken away; and that, as it is so, it is also the best thing for Rico, as we must try to think.\"  At these words Stineli began to weep as her grandmother had never seen her do before; and she sobbed and sobbed, saying, \"The good God did not do it: I did it, grandmother; and therefore I feel as if I should die of anxiety. It was I who proposed to Rico to go to find the lake, and now he has fallen into a ravine, and is dead; it has hurt him dreadfully, and it is all my fault.\" Then the poor child cried and sobbed pitifully. It seemed to the grandmother as if a heavy weight were lifted from her heart as she heard these words of Stineli's. She had given up Rico as lost; and had in secret believed that the child had fled from the unkind treatment he had received at home, and was lying somewhere in the water, or was lost in the woods. Now a new hope arose in her"]]]
