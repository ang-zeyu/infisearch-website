Adventurous young men, who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows, set out in quest of this fruit.  Many of them returned no more; none of them brought back the apples.  No wonder that they found it impossible to gather them!  It is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree, with a hundred terrible heads, fifty of which were always on the watch, while the other fifty slept.  In my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple.  Had the apples been sweet, mellow, and juicy, indeed that would be another matter.  There might then have been some sense in trying to get at them, in spite of the hundred-headed dragon.  But, as I have already told you, it was quite a common thing with young persons, when tired of too much peace and rest, to go in search of the garden of the Hesperides.  And once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world.  At the time of which I am going to speak, he was wandering through the pleasant land of Italy, with a mighty club in his hand, and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders.  He was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen, and which he himself had killed; and though, on the whole, he was kind, and generous, and noble, there was a good deal of the lion’s fierceness in his heart. As he went on his way, he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden.  But none of the country people knew anything about the matter, and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question, if the stranger had not carried so very big a club.  So he journeyed on and on, still making the same inquiry, until, at last, he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers.  “Can you tell me, pretty maidens,” asked the stranger, “whether this is the right way to the garden of the Hesperides?”  The young women had been having a fine time together, weaving the flowers into wreaths, and crowning one another’s heads.  And there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers, that made the flowers more fresh and dewy, and of brighter lines, and sweeter fragrance, while they played with them, than even when they had been growing on their native stems.  But, on hearing the stranger’s question, they dropped all their flowers on the grass, and gazed at him with astonishment.  “The garden of the Hesperides!” cried one.  “We thought mortals had been weary of seeking it, after so many disappointments.  And pray, adventurous traveller, what do you want there?”  “A certain king, who is my cousin,” replied he, “has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples.”  “Most of the young men who go in quest of these apples,” observed another of the damsels, “desire to obtain them for themselves, or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love.  Do you, then, love this king, your cousin, so very much?”  “Perhaps not,” replied the stranger, sighing.  “He has often been severe and cruel to me.  But it is my destiny to obey him.”  “And do you know,” asked the damsel who had first spoken, “that a terrible dragon, with a hundred heads, keeps watch under the golden apple-tree?”  “I know it well,” answered the stranger, calmly.  “But, from my cradle upwards, it has been my business, and almost my pastime, to deal with serpents and dragons.”  The young women looked at his massive club, and at the shaggy lion’s skin which he wore, and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure; and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men.  But, then, the dragon with a hundred heads!  What mortal, even if he possessed a hundred lives, could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster?  So kind-hearted were the maidens, that they could not bear to see this brave and, handsome traveller attempt what was so very dangerous, and devote himself, most probably, to become a meal for the dragon’s hundred ravenous mouths.  “Go back,” cried they all,--“go back to your own home!  Your mother, beholding you safe and sound, will shed tears of joy; and what can she do more, should you win ever so great a victory?  No matter for the golden apples!  No matter for the king, your cruel cousin!  We do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up!”  The stranger seemed to grow impatient at these remonstrances.  He carelessly lifted his mighty club, and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth, near by.  With the force of that idle blow, the great rock was shattered all to pieces.  It cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giant’s strength than for one of the young maidens to touch her sister’s rosy cheek with a flower.  “Do you not believe,” said he, looking at the damsels with a smile, “that such a blow would have crushed one of the dragon’s hundred heads?”  Then he sat down on the grass, and told them the story of his life, or as much of it as he could remember, from the day when he was first cradled in a warrior’s brazen shield.  While he lay there, two immense serpents came gliding over the floor, and opened their hideous jaws to devour him; and he, a baby of a few months old, had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists, and strangled them to death. When he was but a stripling, he had killed a huge lion, almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders.  The next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster, called a hydra, which had no less than nine heads, and exceedingly sharp teeth in every one of them.  “But the dragon of the Hesperides, you know,” observed one of the damsels, “has a hundred heads!”  “Nevertheless,” replied the stranger, “I would rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra.  For, as fast as I cut off a head, two others grew in its place; and, besides, there was one of the heads that could not possibly be killed, but kept biting as fiercely as ever, long after it was cut off.  So I was forced to bury it under a stone, where it is doubtless alive, to this vary day.  But the hydra’s body, and its eight other heads, will never do any further mischief.”  The damsels, judging that the story was likely to last a good while, had been preparing a repast of bread and grapes, that the stranger might refresh himself in the intervals of his talk.  They took pleasure in helping him to this simple food; and, now and then, one of them would put a sweet grape between her rosy lips, lest it should make him bashful to eat alone.  The traveller proceeded to tell how he had chased a very swift stag, for a twelve-month together, without ever stopping to take breath, and had at last caught it by the antlers, and carried it home alive.  And he had fought with a very odd race of people, half horses and half men, and had put them all to death, from a sense of duty, in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more.  Besides all this, he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable.  “Do you call that a wonderful exploit?” asked one of the young maidens, with a smile.  “Any clown in the country has done as much!”  “Had it been an ordinary stable,” replied the stranger, “I should not have mentioned it.  But this was so gigantic a task that it would have taken me all my life to perform it, if I had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stable-door.  That did the business in a very short time!”  Seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened, he next told them how he had shot some monstrous birds, and had caught a wild bull alive, and let him go again, and had tamed a number of very wild horses, and had conquered Hippolyta, the warlike queen of the Amazons.  He mentioned, likewise, that he had taken off Hippolyta’s enchanted girdle, and had given it to the daughter of his cousin, the king.  “Was it the girdle of Venus,” inquired the prettiest of the damsels, “which makes women beautiful?”  “No,” answered the stranger.  “It had formerly been the sword-belt of Mars; and it can only make the wearer valiant and courageous.”  “An old sword-belt!” cried the damsel, tossing her head.  “Then I should not care about having it!”  “You are right,” said the stranger.  Going on with his wonderful narrative, he informed the maidens that as strange an adventure as ever happened was when he fought with Geryon, the six-legged man.  This was a very odd and frightful sort of figure, as you may well believe.  Any person, looking at his tracks in the sand or snow, would suppose that three sociable companions had been walking along together.  On hearing his footsteps at, a little distance, it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming. But it was only the strange man Geryon clattering onward, with his six legs!  Six legs, and one gigantic body!  Certainly, he must have been a very queer monster to look at; and, my stars, what a waste of shoe-leather!  When the stranger had finished the story of his adventures, he looked around at the attentive faces of the maidens.  “Perhaps you may have heard of me before,” said he, modestly.  “My name is Hercules!”  “We had already guessed it,” replied the maidens; “for your wonderful deeds are known all over the world.  We do not think it strange, any longer, that you should set out in quest of the golden apples of the Hesperides.  Come, sisters, let us crown the hero with flowers!”  Then they flung beautiful wreaths over his stately head and mighty shoulders, so that the lion’s skin was almost entirely covered with roses.  They took possession of his ponderous club, and so entwined it about with the brightest, softest, and most fragrant blossoms, that not a finger’s breadth of its oaken substance could be seen.  It looked all like a huge bunch of flowers.  Lastly, they joined"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9257"],["title","The Three Golden Apples (#2)"],["body","nds, and danced around him, chanting words which became poetry of their own accord, and grew into a choral song, in honor of the illustrious Hercules.  And Hercules was rejoiced, as any other hero would have been, to know that these fair young girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had cost him so much toil and danger to achieve.  But, still, he was not satisfied.  He could not think that what he had already done was worthy of so much honor, while there remained any bold or difficult adventure to be undertaken.  “Dear maidens,” said he, when they paused to take breath, “now that you know my name, will you not tell me how I am to reach the garden of the Hesperides?”  “Ah! must you go so soon?” they exclaimed.  “You--that have performed so many wonders, and spent such a toilsome life--cannot you content yourself to repose a little while on the margin of this peaceful river?”  Hercules shook his head.  “I must depart now,” said he.  “We will then give you the best directions we can,” replied the damsels. “You must go to the sea-shore, and find out the Old One, and compel him to inform you where the golden apples are to be found.”  “The Old One!” repeated Hercules, laughing at this odd name.  “And, pray, who may the Old One be?”  “Why, the Old Man of the Sea, to be sure!” answered one of the damsels. “He has fifty daughters, whom some people call very beautiful; but we do not think it proper to be acquainted with them, because they have sea-green hair, and taper away like fishes.  You must talk with this Old Man of the Sea.  He is a sea-faring person, and knows all about the garden of the Hesperides; for it is situated in an island which he is often in the habit of visiting.”  Hercules then asked whereabouts the Old One was most likely to be met with.  When the damsels had informed him, he thanked them for all their kindness,--for the bread and grapes with which they had fed him, the lovely flowers with which they had crowned him, and the songs and dances wherewith they had done him honor,--and he thanked them, most of all, for telling him the right way,--and immediately set forth upon his Journey.  But, before he was out of hearing, one of the maidens called after him.  “Keep fast hold of the Old-One, when you catch him!” cried she, smiling, and lifting her finger to make the caution more impressive.  “Do not be astonished at anything that may happen.  Only hold him fast, and he will tell you what you wish to know.”  Hercules again thanked her, and pursued his way, while the maidens resumed their pleasant labor of making flower-wreaths.  They talked about the hero, long after he was gone.  “We will crown him with the loveliest of our garlands,” said they, “when he returns hither with the three golden apples, after slaying the dragon with a hundred heads.”  Meanwhile, Hercules travelled constantly onward, over hill and dale, and through the solitary woods.  Sometimes he swung his club aloft, and splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow.  His mind was so full of the giants and monsters with whom it was the business of his life to fight, that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant or a monster. And so eager was Hercules to achieve what he had undertaken, that he almost regretted to have spent so much time with the damsels, wasting idle breath upon the story of his adventures.  But thus it always is with persons who are destined to perform great things.  What they have already done seems less than nothing.  What they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil, danger, and life itself.  Persons who happened to be passing through the forest must have been affrighted to see him smite the trees with his great club.  With but a single blow, the trunk was riven as by the stroke of lightning, and the broad boughs came rustling and crashing down.  Hastening forward, without ever pausing or looking behind, he by and by heard the sea roaring at a distance.  At this sound, he increased his speed, and soon came to a beach, where the great surf-waves tumbled themselves upon the hard sand, in a long line of snowy foam.  At one end of the beach, however, there was a pleasant spot, where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff, making its rocky face look soft and beautiful.  A carpet of verdant grass, largely intermixed with sweet-smelling clover, covered the narrow space between the bottom of the cliff and the sea.  And what should Hercules espy there, but an old man, fast asleep!  But was it really and truly an old man?  Certainly, at first sight, it looked very like one; but, on closer inspection, it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea.  For, on his legs and arms there were scales, such as fishes have; he was web-footed and web-fingered, after the fashion of a duck; and his long beard, being of a greenish tinge, had more the appearance of a tuft of sea-weed than of an ordinary beard.  Have you never seen a stick of timber, that has been long tossed about by the waves, and has got all overgrown with barnacles, and, at last drifting ashore, seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea?  Well, the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wave-tost spar!  But Hercules, the instant he set eyes on this strange figure, was convinced that it could be no other than the Old One, who was to direct him on his way.  Yes; it was the selfsame Old Man of the Sea, whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him about.  Thanking his stars for the lucky accident of finding the old fellow asleep, Hercules stole on tiptoe towards him, and caught him by the arm and leg.  “Tell me,” cried he, before the Old One was well awake, “which is the way to the garden of the Hesperides?”  As you may easily imagine, the Old Man of the Sea awoke in a fright. But his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of Hercules, the next moment.  For, all of a sudden, the Old One seemed to disappear out of his grasp, and he found himself holding a stag by the fore and hind leg!  But still he kept fast hold.  Then the stag disappeared, and in its stead there was a sea-bird, fluttering and screaming, while Hercules clutched it by the wing and claw!  But the bird could not get away.  Immediately afterwards, there was an ugly three-headed dog, which growled and barked at Hercules, and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him!  But Hercules would not let him go.  In another minute, instead of the three-headed dog, what should appear but Geryon, the six-legged man-monster, kicking at Hercules with five of his legs, in order to get the remaining one at liberty!  But Hercules held on.  By and by, no Geryou was there, but a huge snake, like one of those which Hercules had strangled in his babyhood, only a hundred times as big, and it twisted and twined about the hero’s neck and body, and threw its tail high into the air, and opened its deadly jaws as if to devour him outright; so that it was really a very terrible spectacle!  But Hercules was no whit disheartened, and squeezed the great snake so tightly that he soon began to hiss with pain.  You must understand that the Old Man of the Sea, though he generally looked so much like the wave-beaten figure-head of a vessel, had the power of assuming any shape he pleased.  When he found himself so roughly seized by Hercules, he had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise and terror, by these magical transformations, that the hero would be glad to let him go.  If Hercules had relaxed his grasp, the Old One would certainly have plunged down to the very bottom of the sea, whence he would not soon have given himself the trouble of coming up, in order to answer any impertinent questions.  Ninety-nine people out of a hundred, I suppose, would have been frightened out of their wits by the very first of his ugly shapes, and would have taken to their heels at once.  For, one of the hardest things in this world is, to see the difference between real dangers and imaginary ones.  But, as Hercules held on so stubbornly, and only squeezed the Old One so much the tighter at every change of shape, and really put him to no small torture, he finally thought it best to reappear in his own figure. So there he was again, a fishy, scaly, webfooted sort of personage, with something like a tuft of sea-weed at his chin.  “Pray, what do you want with me?” cried the Old One, as soon as he could take breath; for it is quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false shapes.  “Why do you squeeze me so hard?  Let me go, this moment, or I shall begin to consider you an extremely uncivil person!”  “My name is Hercules!” roared the mighty stranger.  “And you will never get out of my clutch, until you tell me the nearest way to the garden of the Hesperides!”  When the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him, he saw, with half an eye, that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know.  The Old One was an inhabitant of the sea, you must recollect, and roamed about everywhere, like other sea-faring people. Of course, he had often heard of the fame of Hercules, and of the wonderful things that he was constantly performing, in various parts of the earth, and how determined he always was to accomplish whatever he undertook.  He therefore made no more attempts to escape, but told the hero how to find the garden of the Hesperides, and likewise warned him of many difficulties which must be overcome, before he could arrive thither.  “You must go on, thus and thus,” said the Old Man of the Sea, after taking the points of the compass, “till you come in sight of a very tall giant, who holds the sky on his shoulders.  And the giant, if he happens to be in the humor, will tell you exactly where the garden of the Hesperides lies.”  “And if the giant happens not to be in the humor,” remarked Hercules, balancing his club on the tip of his finger, “perhaps I shall find means to persuade him!”  Thanking the Old Man of the Sea, and begging his "]]]
