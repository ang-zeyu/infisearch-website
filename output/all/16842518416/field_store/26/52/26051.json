The priest now rose from the stool, and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper, and a flint and steel.  With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel's arms, Hatch looking on disconsolate; and then the whole party proceeded, somewhat timorously, to sally from the house and get to horse.  \"'Tis time we were on the road, Sir Oliver,\" said Hatch, as he held the priest's stirrup while he mounted.  \"Ay; but, Bennet, things are changed,\" returned the parson.  \"There is now no Appleyard--rest his soul!--to keep the garrison.  I shall keep you, Bennet.  I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows.  'The arrow that flieth by day,' saith the evangel; I have no mind of the context; nay, I am a sluggard priest, I am too deep in men's affairs.  Well, let us ride forth, Master Hatch.  The jackmen should be at the church by now.\"  So they rode forward down the road, with the wind after them, blowing the tails of the parson's cloak; and behind them, as they went, clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun.  They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet, when, coming to a turn, they saw the church before them.  Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows.  At the lych-gate, near a score of men were gathered, some in the saddle, some standing by their horses' heads.  They were variously armed and mounted; some with spears, some with bills, some with bows, and some bestriding plough-horses, still splashed with the mire of the furrow; for these were the very dregs of the country, and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field.  \"We have not done amiss, praised be the cross of Holywood!  Sir Daniel will be right well content,\" observed the priest, inwardly numbering the troop.  \"Who goes?  Stand! if ye be true!\" shouted Bennet.  A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment, and fairly took to his heels for the forest.  The men at the gate, who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger's presence, woke and scattered.  Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle; the rest rode in pursuit; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground, and it was plain their quarry would escape them.  Hatch, roaring an oath, put his horse at the hedge, to head him off; but the beast refused, and sent his rider sprawling in the dust.  And though he was up again in a moment, and had caught the bridle, the time had gone by, and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture.  The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton.  Instead of starting in a vain pursuit, he had whipped his crossbow from his back, bent it, and set a quarrel to the string; and now, when the others had desisted, he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot.  \"Shoot! shoot!\" cried the priest, with sanguinary violence.  \"Cover him, Master Dick,\" said Bennet.  \"Bring me him down like a ripe apple.\"  The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill; and the man ran slower in proportion.  What with the greyness of the falling night, and the uneven movements of the runner, it was no easy aim; and as Dick levelled his bow, he felt a kind of pity, and a half desire that he might miss.  The quarrel sped.  The man stumbled and fell, and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers.  But they were counting their corn before the harvest.  The man fell lightly; he was lightly afoot again, turned and waved his cap in a bravado, and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood.  \"And the plague go with him!\" cried Bennet.  \"He has thieves' heels; he can run, by St Banbury!  But you touched him, Master Shelton; he has stolen your quarrel, may he never have good I grudge him less!\"  \"Nay, but what made he by the church?\" asked Sir Oliver.  \"I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here.  Clipsby, good fellow, get ye down from your horse, and search thoroughly among the yews.\"  Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper.  \"This writing was pinned to the church door,\" he said, handing it to the parson.  \"I found naught else, sir parson.\"  \"Now, by the power of Mother Church,\" cried Sir Oliver, \"but this runs hard on sacrilege!  For the king's good pleasure, or the lord of the manor--well!  But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door--nay, it runs hard on sacrilege, hard; and men have burned for matters of less weight.  But what have we here? The light falls apace.  Good Master Richard, y' have young eyes.  Read me, I pray, this libel.\"  Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud.  It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel, hardly even rhyming, written in a gross character, and most uncouthly spelt.  With the spelling somewhat bettered, this is how they ran:      \"I had four blak arrows under my belt,     Four for the greefs that I have felt,     Four for the nomber of ill menne     That have opressid me now and then.      One is gone; one is wele sped;     Old Apulyaird is ded.      One is for Maister Bennet Hatch,     That burned Grimstone, walls and thatch.      One for Sir Oliver Oates,     That cut Sir Harry Shelton's throat.      Sir Daniel, ye shull have the fourt;     We shall think it fair sport.      Ye shull each have your own part,     A blak arrow in each blak heart.     Get ye to your knees for to pray:     Ye are ded theeves, by yea and nay!                                                              \"JON AMEND-ALL                                                         of the Green Wood,                                                 And his jolly fellaweship.      \"Item, we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your     following.\"  \"Now, well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces!\" cried Sir Oliver, lamentably.  \"Sirs, this is an ill world, and groweth daily worse.  I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight's hurt, whether in act or purpose, as the babe unchristened. Neither was his throat cut; for therein they are again in error, as there still live credible witnesses to show.\"  \"It boots not, sir parson,\" said Bennet.  \"Here is unseasonable talk.\"  \"Nay, Master Bennet, not so.  Keep ye in your due place, good Bennet,\" answered the priest.  \"I shall make mine innocence appear.  I will, upon no consideration, lose my poor life in error.  I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter.  I was not even in the Moat House.  I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock\"--  \"Sir Oliver,\" said Hatch, interrupting, \"since it please you not to stop this sermon, I will take other means.  Goffe, sound to horse.\"  And while the tucket was sounding, Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson, and whispered violently in his ear.  Dick Shelton saw the priest's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance.  He had some cause for thought; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father.  But he said never a word, and kept his countenance unmoved.  Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation; ten men, it was decided between them, should be reserved, not only to garrison the Moat House, but to escort the priest across the wood.  In the meantime, as Bennet was to remain behind, the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton.  Indeed, there was no choice; the men were loutish fellows, dull and unskilled in war, while Dick was not only popular, but resolute and grave beyond his age. Although his youth had been spent in these rough, country places, the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver, and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command. Bennet had always been kind and helpful; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies, but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends; and now, while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write, in his swift, exquisite penmanship, a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master, Sir Daniel Brackley, Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise.  \"Ye must go the long way about, Master Shelton,\" he said; \"round by the bridge, for your life!  Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you, to draw shots; and go softly till y' are past the wood.  If the rogues fall upon you, ride for 't; ye will do naught by standing.  And keep ever forward, Master Shelton; turn me not back again, an ye love your life; there is no help in Tunstall, mind ye that.  And now, since ye go to the great wars about the king, and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life, and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below, I give you my last counsels now at your riding.  Keep an eye on Sir Daniel; he is unsure.  Put not your trust in the jack-priest; he intendeth not amiss, but doth the will of others; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel!  Get your good lordship where ye go; make you strong friends; look to it.  And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch.  There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet.  So, God-speed!\"  \"And Heaven be with you, Bennet!\" returned Dick.  \"Ye were a good friend to me-ward, and so I shall say ever.\"  \"And, look ye, master,\" added Hatch, with a certain embarrassment, \"if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me, ye might, mayhap, lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory.\"  \"Ye shall have your will of it, Bennet,\" answered Dick.  \"But, what cheer, man! we shall meet again, where ye shall have more need of ale than masses.\"  \"The saints so grant it, Master Dick!\" returned the other.  \"But here comes Sir Oliver.

BOOK I--THE TWO LADS   CHAPTER I--AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY   Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night, warmly quartered and well patrolled.  But the Knight of Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting; and even now, when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him, he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours.  He was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant, and then, by the favour he curried with great lords about the king, procure unjust decisions in his favour; or, if that was too roundabout, to seize the disputed manor by force of arms, and rely on his influence and Sir Oliver's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched.  Kettley was one such place; it had come very lately into his clutches; he still met with opposition from the tenants; and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way.  By two in the morning, Sir Daniel sat in the inn room, close by the fireside, for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley.  By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale.  He had taken off his visored headpiece, and sat with his bald head and thin, dark visage resting on one hand, wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak.  At the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches; and somewhat nearer hand, a young lad, apparently of twelve or thirteen, was stretched in a mantle on the floor.  The host of the Sun stood before the great man.  \"Now, mark me, mine host,\" Sir Daniel said, \"follow but mine orders, and I shall be your good lord ever.  I must have good men for head boroughs, and I will have Adam-a-More high constable; see to it narrowly.  If other men be chosen, it shall avail you nothing; rather it shall be found to your sore cost.  For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure--you among the rest, mine host.\"  \"Good knight,\" said the host, \"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion.  Nay, bully knight, I love not the rogue Walsinghams; they were as poor as thieves, bully knight.  Give me a great lord like you.  Nay; ask me among the neighbours, I am stout for Brackley.\"  \"It may be,\" said Sir Daniel, dryly.  \"Ye shall then pay twice.\"  The innkeeper made a horrid grimace; but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times, and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily.  \"Bring up yon fellow, Selden!\" cried the knight.  And one of his retainers led up a poor, cringing old man, as pale as a candle, and all shaking with the fen fever.  \"Sirrah,\" said Sir Daniel, \"your name?\"  \"An't please your worship,\" replied the man, \"my name is Condall--Condall of Shoreby, at your good worship's pleasure.\"  \"I have heard you ill reported on,\" returned the knight.  \"Ye deal in treason, rogue; ye trudge the country leasing; y' are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals.  How, fellow, are ye so bold?  But I will bring you down.\"  \"Right honourable and my reverend lord,\" the man cried, \"here is some hodge-podge, saving your good presence.  I am but a poor private man, and have hurt none.\"  \"The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely,\" said the knight. \"'Seize me,' saith he, 'that Tyndal of Shoreby.'\"  \"Condall, my good lord; Condall is my poor name,\" said the unfortunate.  \"Condall or Tyndal, it is all one,\" replied Sir Daniel, coolly.  \"For, by my sooth, y' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty.  If ye would save your neck, write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound.\"  \"For twenty pound, my good lord!\" cried Condall.  \"Here is midsummer madness!  My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings.\"  \"Condall or Tyndal,\" returned Sir Daniel, grinning, \"I will run my peril of that loss.  Write me down twenty, and when I have recovered all I may, I will be good lord to you, and pardon you the rest.\"  \"Alas! my good lord, it may not be; I have no skill to write,\" said Condall.  \"Well-a-day!\" returned the knight.  \"Here, then, is no remedy.  Yet I would fain have spared you, Tyndal, had my conscience suffered.  Selden, take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm, and hang me him tenderly by the neck, where I may see him at my riding.  Fare ye well, good Master Condall, dear Master Tyndal; y' are post-haste for Paradise; fare ye then well!\"  \"Nay, my right pleasant lord,\" replied Condall, forcing an obsequious smile, \"an ye be so masterful, as doth right well become you, I will even, with all my poor skill, do your good bidding.\"  \"Friend,\" quoth Sir Daniel, \"ye will now write two score.  Go to! y' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings.  Selden, see him write me this in good form, and have it duly witnessed.\"  And Sir Daniel, who was a very merry knight, none merrier in England, took a drink of his mulled ale, and lay back, smiling.  Meanwhile, the boy upon the floor began to stir, and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare.  \"Hither,\" said Sir Daniel; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him, he leaned back and laughed outright.  \"By the rood!\" he cried, \"a sturdy boy!\"  The lad flushed crimson with anger, and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes.  Now that he was on his legs, it was more difficult to make certain of his age.  His face looked somewhat older in expression, but it was as smooth as a young child's; and in bone and body he was unusually slender, and somewhat awkward of gait.  \"Ye have called me, Sir Daniel,\" he said.  \"Was it to laugh at my poor plight?\"  \"Nay, now, let laugh,\" said the knight.  \"Good shrew, let laugh, I pray you.  An ye could see yourself, I warrant ye would laugh the first.\"  \"Well,\" cried the lad, flushing, \"ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other.  Laugh while yet ye may!\"  \"Nay, now, good cousin,\" replied Sir Daniel, with some earnestness, \"think not that I mock at you, except in mirth, as between kinsfolk and singular friends.  I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds, go to! and cherish you exceedingly.  I took you, indeed, roughly, as the time demanded; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you.  Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton--Lady Shelton, by my troth! for the lad promiseth bravely.  Tut! ye will not shy for honest laughter; it purgeth melancholy.  They are no rogues who laugh, good cousin.  Good mine host, lay me a meal now for my cousin, Master John. Sit ye down, sweetheart, and eat.\"  \"Nay,\" said Master John, \"I will break no bread.  Since ye force me to this sin, I will fast for my soul's interest.  But, good mine host, I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed.\"  \"Ye shall have a dispensation, go to!\" cried the knight.  \"Shalt be well shriven, by my faith!  Content you, then, and eat.\"  But the lad was obstinate, drank a cup of water, and, once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle, sat in a far corner, brooding.  In an hour or two, there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses; and then a troop drew up by the inn door, and Richard Shelton, splashed with mud, presented himself upon the threshold.  \"Save you, Sir Daniel,\" he said.  \"How!  Dickie Shelton!\" cried the knight; and at the mention of Dick's name the other lad looked curiously across.  \"What maketh Bennet Hatch?\"  \"Please you, sir knight, to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver, wherein are all things fully stated,\" answered Richard, presenting the priest's letter.  \"And please you farther, ye were best make all speed to Risingham; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters, and by his report, my Lord of Risingham was sore bested, and lacked exceedingly your presence.\"  \"How say you?  Sore bested?\" returned the knight.  \"Nay, then, we will make speed sitting down, good Richard.  As the world goes in this poor realm of England, he that rides softliest rides surest.  Delay, they say, begetteth peril; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men; mark it, Dick.  But let me see, first, what cattle ye have brought. Selden, a link here at the door!\"  And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street, and, by the red glow of a torch, inspected his new troops.  He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant.  His dash, his proved courage, his forethought for the soldiers' comfort, even his rough gibes, were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet.  \"Nay, by the rood!\" he cried, \"what poor dogs are these?  Here be some as crooked as a bow, and some as lean as a spear.  Friends, ye shall ride in the front of the battle; I can spare you, friends.  Mark me this old villain on the piebald!  A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly!  Ha!  Clipsby, are ye there, old rat?  Y' are a man I could lose with a good heart; ye shall go in front of all, with a bull's eye painted on your jack, to be the better butt for archery; sirrah, ye shall show me the way.\"  \"I will show you any way, Sir Daniel, but the way to change sides,\" returned Clipsby, sturdily.  Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw.  \"Why, well said!\" he cried.  \"Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth, go to! I will forgive you for that merry word.  Selden, see them fed, both man and brute.\"  The knight re-entered the inn.  \"Now, friend Dick,\" he said, \"fall to.  Here is good ale and bacon.  Eat, while that I read.\"  Sir Daniel opened"]]]
