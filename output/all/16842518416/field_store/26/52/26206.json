The man who wielded it long ago was a gallant gentleman and a stalwart captain. And my Lord, as he told me but on Thursday afternoon, hung it there that he might always have in mind the fact that he bore the name of this man, and must bear it meritoriously. My Lord is a gentleman. La, believe me, if you, too, were a gentleman, Mr. Orts, you would understand! But a gentleman is not a talebearer; a gentleman does not defame any person behind his back, far less the person to whom he owes his daily bread.\"  \"So he has been gulling you?\" said Simon Orts; then he added quite inconsequently: \"I had not thought anything you could say would hurt me. I discover I was wrong. Perhaps I am not a gentleman. Faith, no; I am only a shabby drunkard, a disgrace to my cloth, am I not, Anastasia? Accordingly, I fail to perceive what old Aluric Floyer has to do with the matter in hand. He was reasonably virtuous, I suppose; putting aside a disastrous appetite for fruit, so was Adam: but, viewing their descendants, I ruefully admit that in each case the strain has deteriorated.\"  There was a brief silence; then Lady Allonby observed: \"Perhaps I was discourteous. I ask your forgiveness, Mr. Orts. And now, if you will pardon the suggestion, I think you had better go to your dying parishioner.\"  But she had touched the man to the quick. \"I am a drunkard; who made me so? Who was it used to cuddle me with so many soft words and kisses--yes, kisses, my Lady!--till a wealthier man came a-wooing, and then flung me aside like an old shoe?\"  This drenched her cheeks with crimson, \"I think we had better not refer to that boy-and-girl affair. You cannot blame me for your debauched manner of living. I found before it was too late that I did not love you. I was only a girl, and 'twas natural that at first I should be mistaken in my fancies.\"  The Vicar had caught her by each wrist. \"You don't understand, of course. You never understood, for you have no more heart than one of those pink-and-white bisque figures that you resemble. You don't love me, and therefore I will go to the devil' may not be an all-rational deduction, but 'tis very human logic. You don't understand that, do you, Anastasia? You don't understand how when one is acutely miserable one remembers that at the bottom of a wineglass--or even at the bottom of a tumbler of gin,--one may come upon happiness, or at least upon acquiescence to whatever the niggling gods may send. You don't understand how one remembers, when the desired woman is lost, that there are other women whose lips are equally red and whose hearts are tenderer and--yes, whose virtue is less exigent. No; women never understand these things: and in any event, you would not understand, because you are only an adorable pink-and-white fool.\"  \"Oh, oh!\" she cried, struggling, \"How dare you? You insult me, you coward!\"  \"Well, you can always comfort yourself with the reflection that it scarcely matters what a sot like me may elect to say. And, since you understand me now no more than formerly, Anastasia, I tell you that the lover turned adrift may well profit by the example of his predecessors. Other lovers have been left forsaken, both in trousers and in ripped petticoats; and I have heard that when Chryseis was reft away from Agamemnon, the _cnax andrôn_ made himself tolerably comfortable with Briseis; and that, when Theseus sneaked off in the night, Ariadne, after having wept for a decent period, managed in the ultimate to console herself with Theban Bacchus,--which I suppose to be a courteous method of stating that the daughter of Minos took to drink. So the forsaken lover has his choice of consolation--in wine or in that dearer danger, woman. I have tried both, Anastasia. And I tell you--\"  He dropped her hands as though they had been embers. Lord Rokesle had come quietly into the hall.  \"Why, what's this?\" Lord Rokesle demanded. \"Simon, you aren't making love to Lady Allonby, I hope? Fie, man! remember your cloth.\"  Simon Orts wheeled--a different being, servile and cringing. \"Your Lordship is pleased to be pleasant. Indeed, though, I fear that your ears must burn, sir, for I was but now expatiating upon the manifold kindnesses your Lordship has been so generous as to confer upon your unworthy friend. I was admiring Lady Allonby's ruffle, sir,--Valenciennes, I take it, and very choice.\"  Lord Rokesle laughed. \"So I am to thank you for blowing my trumpet, am I?\" said Lord Rokesle. \"Well, you are not a bad fellow, Simon, so long as you are sober. And now be off with you to Holles--the rascal is dying, they tell me. My luck, Simon! He made up a cravat better than any one in the kingdom.\"  \"The ways of Providence are inscrutable,\" Simon Orts considered; \"and if Providence has in verity elected to chasten your Lordship, doubtless it shall be, as anciently in the case of Job the Patriarch, repaid by a recompense, by a thousandfold recompense.\" And after a meaning glance toward Lady Allonby,--a glance that said: \"I, too, have a tongue,\"--he was mounting the stairway to the upper corridor when Lord Rokesle called to him.  \"By my conscience! I forgot,\" said Lord Rokesle; \"don't leave Stornoway without seeing me again, I shall want you by and by.\"   II  Lord Rokesle sat down upon the long, high-backed bench, beside the fire, and facing Lady Allonby's arm-chair.  Neither he nor Lady Allonby spoke for a while.  In a sombre way Lord Rokesle was a handsome man, and to-night, in brown and gold, very stately. His bearing savored faintly of the hidalgo; indeed, his mother was a foreign woman, cast ashore on Usk, from a wrecked Spanish vessel, and incontinently married by the despot of the island. For her, Death had delayed his advent unmercifully; but her reason survived the marriage by two years only, and there were those familiar with the late Lord Rokesle's [Footnote: Born 1685, and accidentally killed by Sir Piers Sabiston in 1738; an accurate account of this notorious duellist, profligate, charlatan, and playwright is given in Ireson's _Letters_.] peculiarities who considered that in this, at least, the crazed lady was fortunate. Among these gossips it was also esteemed a matter deserving comment that in the shipwrecks not infrequent about Usk the women sometimes survived, but the men never.  Now Lord Rokesle regarded Lady Allonby, the while that she displayed conspicuous interest in the play of the flames. But by and by, \"O vulgarity!\" said Lady Allonby. \"Pray endeavor to look a little more cheerful. Positively, you are glaring at me like one of those disagreeable beggars one so often sees staring at bakery windows.\"  He smiled. \"Do you remember what the Frenchman wrote--_et pain ne voyent qu'aux fenêtres?_ There is not an enormous difference between me and the tattered rascal of Chepe, for we both stare longingly at what we most desire. And were I minded to hunt the simile to the foot of the letter, I would liken your coquetry to the intervening window-pane,--not easily broken through, but very, very transparent, Anastasia.\"  \"You are not overwhelmingly polite,\" she said, reflectively; \"but, then, I suppose, living in the country is sure to damage a man's manners. Still, my dear Orson, you smack too much of the forest.\"  \"Anastasia,\" said Lord Rokesle, bending toward her, \"will you always be thus cruel? Do you not understand that in this world you are the only thing I care for? You think me a boor; perhaps I am,--and yet it rests with you, my Lady, to make me what you will. For I love you, Anastasia--\"  \"Why, how delightful of you!\" said she, languidly.  \"It is not a matter for jesting. I tell you that I love you.\" My Lord's color was rising.  But Lady Allonby yawned. \"Your honor's most devoted,\" she declared herself; \"still, you need not boast of your affection as if falling in love with me were an uncommonly difficult achievement. That, too, is scarcely polite.\"  \"For the tenth time I ask you will you marry me?\" said Lord Rokesle.  \"Is't only the tenth time? Dear me, it seems like the thousandth. Of course, I couldn't think of it. Heavens, my Lord, how can you expect me to marry a man who glares at me like that? Positively you look as ferocious as the blackamoor in the tragedy,--the fellow who smothered his wife because she misplaced a handkerchief, you remember.\"  Lord Rokesle had risen, and he paced the hall, as if fighting down resentment. \"I am no Othello,\" he said at last; \"though, indeed, I think that the love I bear you is of a sort which rarely stirs our English blood. 'Tis not for nothing I am half-Spaniard, I warn you, Anastasia, my love is a consuming blaze that will not pause for considerations of policy nor even of honor. And you madden me, Anastasia! To-day you hear my protestations with sighs and glances and faint denials; to-morrow you have only taunts for me. Sometimes, I think, 'tis hatred rather than love I bear you. Sometimes--\" He clutched at his breast with a wild gesture. \"I burn!\" he said. \"Woman, give me back a human heart in place of this flame you have kindled here, or I shall go mad! Last night I dreamed of hell, and of souls toasted on burning forks and fed with sops of bale-fire,--and you were there, Anastasia, where the flames leaped and curled like red-blazoned snakes about the poor damned. And I, too, was there. And through eternity I heard you cry to God in vain, O dear, wonderful, golden-haired woman! and we could see Him, somehow,--see Him, a great way off, with straight, white brows that frowned upon you pitilessly. And I was glad. For I knew then that I hated you. And even now, when I think I must go mad for love of you, I yet hate you with a fervor that shakes and thrills in every fibre of me. Oh, I burn, I burn!\" he cried, with the same frantic clutching at his breast.  Lady Allonby had risen.  \"Positively, I must ask you to open a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8715"],["title","Gallantry: Dizain des Fetes Galantes (#4)"],["body","if you intend to continue in this strain. D'ye mean to suffocate me, my Lord, with your flames and your blazes and your brimstone and so on? You breathe conflagrations, like a devil in a pantomime. I had as soon converse with a piece of fireworks. So, if you'll pardon me, I will go to my brother.\"  At the sound of her high, crisp speech his frenzy fell from him like a mantle. \"And you let me kiss you yesterday! Oh, I know you struggled, but you did not struggle very hard, did you, Anastasia?\"  \"Why, what a notion!\" cried Lady Allonby; \"as if a person should bother seriously one way or the other about the antics of an amorous clodhopper! Meanwhile, I repeat, my Lord, I wish to go to my brother.\"  \"Egad!\" Lord Rokesle retorted, \"that reminds me I have been notably remiss. I bear you a message from Harry. He had to-night a letter from Job Nangle, who, it seems, has a purchaser for Trevor's Folly at last. The fellow is with our excellent Nangle at Peniston Friars, and offers liberal terms if the sale be instant. The chance was too promising to let slip, so Harry left the island an hour ago. It happened by a rare chance that some of my fellows were on the point of setting out for the mainland,--and he knew that he could safely entrust you to Mrs. Morfit's duennaship, he said.\"  \"He should not have done so,\" Lady Allonby observed, as if in a contention of mind. \"He--I will go to Mrs. Morfit, then, to confess to her in frankness that, after all these rockets and bonfires--\"  \"Why, that's the unfortunate part of the whole affair,\" said Lord Rokesle. \"The same boat brought Sabina a letter which summoned her to the bedside of her husband, [Footnote: Archibald Morfit, M.P. for Salop, and in 1753 elected Speaker, which office he declined on account of ill-health. He was created a baronet in 1758 through the Duke of Ormskirk's influence.] who, it appears, lies desperately ill at Kuyper Manor. It happened by a rare chance that some of my fellows were on the point of setting out for the mainland--from Heriz pier yonder, not from the end of the island whence Harry sailed,--so she and her maid embarked instanter. Of course, there was your brother here to play propriety, she said. And by the oddest misfortune in the world,\" Lord Rokesle sighed, \"I forgot to tell her that Harry Heleigh had left Usk a half-hour earlier. My memory is lamentably treacherous.\"  But Lady Allonby had dropped all affectation. \"You coward! You planned this!\"  \"Candidly, yes. Nangle is my agent as well as Harry's, you may remember. I have any quantity of his letters, and of course an equal number of Archibald's. So I spent the morning in my own apartments, Anastasia,--tracing letters against the window-pane, which was, I suppose, a childish recreation, but then what would you have? As you very justly observe, country life invariably coarsens a man's tastes; and accordingly, as you may now recall, I actually declined a game of _écarté_ with you in order to indulge in these little forgeries. Decidedly, my dear, you must train your husband's imagination for superior flights--when you are Lady Rokesle.\"  She was staring at him as though he had been a portent. \"I am alone,\" she said. \"Alone--in this place--with you! Alone! you devil!\"  \"Your epithets increase in vigor. Just now I was only a clodhopper. Well, I can but repeat that it rests with you to make me what you will. Though, indeed, you are to all intent alone upon Usk, and upon Usk there are many devils. There are ten of them on guard yonder, by the way, in case your brother should return inopportunely, though that's scarcely probable. Obedient devils, you observe, Anastasia,--devils who exert and check their deviltry as I bid 'em, for they esteem me Lucifer's lieutenant. And I grant the present situation is an outrage to propriety, yet the evil is not incurable. Lady Allonby may not, if she value her reputation, pass to-night at Stornoway; but here am I, all willingness, and upstairs is the parson. Believe me, Anastasia, the most vinegarish prude could never object to Lady Rokesle's spending to-night at Stornoway.\"  \"Let me think, let me think!\" Lady Allonby said, and her hands plucked now at her hair, now at her dress. She appeared dazed. \"I can't think!\" she wailed on a sudden. \"I am afraid. I--O Vincent, Vincent, you cannot do this thing! I trusted you, Vincent. I know I let you make love to me, and I relished having you make love to me. Women are like that. But I cannot marry you, Vincent. There is a man, yonder in England, whom I love. He does not care for me any more,--he is in love with my step-daughter. That is very amusing, is it not, Vincent? Some day I may be his mother-in-law. Why don't you laugh, Vincent? Come, let us both laugh--first at this and then at the jest you have just played on me. Do you know, for an instant, I believed you were in earnest? But Harry went to sleep over the cards, didn't he? And Mrs. Morfit has gone to bed with one of her usual headaches? Of course; and you thought you would retaliate upon me for teasing you. You were quite right, 'Twas an excellent jest. Now let us laugh at it. Laugh, Vincent! Oh!\" she said now, more shrilly, \"for the love of God, laugh, laugh!--or I shall go mad!\"  But Lord Rokesle was a man of ice, \"Matrimony is a serious matter, Anastasia; 'tis not becoming in those who are about to enter it to exhibit undue levity. I wonder what's keeping Simon?\"  \"Simon Orts!\" she said, in a half-whisper. Then she came toward Lord Rokesle, smiling. \"Why, of course, I teased you, Vincent, but there was never any hard feeling, was there? And you really wish me to marry you? Well, we must see, Vincent. But, as you say, matrimony is a serious matter. D'ye know you say very sensible things, Vincent?--not at all like those silly fops yonder in London. I dare say you and I would be very happy together. But you wouldn't have any respect for me if I married you on a sudden like this, would you? Of course not. So you will let me consider it. Come to me a month from now, say,--is that too long to wait? Well, I think 'tis too long myself. Say a week, then. I must have my wedding-finery, you comprehend. We women are such vain creatures--not big and brave and sensible like you men. See, for example, how much bigger your hand is than mine--mine's quite lost in it, isn't it? So--since I am only a vain, chattering, helpless female thing,--you are going to indulge me and let me go up to London for some new clothes, aren't you, Vincent? Of course you will; and we will be married in a week. But you will let me go to London first, won't you?--away from this dreadful place, away--I didn't mean that. I suppose it is a very agreeable place when you get accustomed to it. And 'tis only for clothes--Oh, I swear it is only for clothes, Vincent! And you said you would--yes, only a moment ago you distinctly said you would let me go. 'Tis not as if I were not coming back--who said I would not come back? Of course I will. But you must give me time, Vincent dear,--you must, you must, I tell you! O God!\" she sobbed, and flung from her the loathed hand she was fondling, \"it's no use!\"  \"No,\" said Lord Rokesle, rather sadly. \"I am not Samson, nor are you Delilah to cajole me. It's of no use, Anastasia. I would have preferred that you came to me voluntarily, but since you cannot, I mean to take you unwilling. Simon,\" he called, loudly, \"does that rascal intend to spin out his dying interminably? Charon's waiting, man.\"  From above, \"Coming, my Lord,\" said Simon Orts.   III  The Vicar of Heriz Magna descended the stairway with deliberation. His eyes twitched from the sobbing woman to Lord Rokesle, and then back again, in that furtive way Orts had of glancing about a room, without moving his head; he seemed to lie in ambush under his gross brows; and whatever his thoughts may have been, he gave them no utterance.  \"Simon,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"Lady Allonby is about to make me the happiest of men. Have you a prayer-book about you, Master Parson?--for here's a loving couple desirous of entering the blessed state of matrimony.\"  \"The match is somewhat of the suddenest,\" said Simon Orts. \"But I have known these impromptu marriages to turn out very happily--very happily, indeed.\" he repeated, rubbing his hands together, and smiling horribly. \"I gather that Mr. Heleigh will not grace the ceremony with his presence?\"  They understood each other, these two. Lord Rokesle grinned, and in a few words told the ecclesiastic of the trick which had insured the absence of the other guests; and Simon Orts also grinned, but respectfully,--the grin, of the true lackey wearing his master's emotions like his master's clothes, at second-hand.  \"A very pretty stratagem,\" said Simon Orts; \"unconventional, I must confess, but it is proverbially known that all's fair in love.\"  At this Lady Allonby came to him, catching his hand. \"There is only you, Simon. Oh, there is no hope in that lustful devil yonder. But you are not all base, Simon. You are a man,--ah, God! if I were a man I would rip out that devil's heart--his defiled and infamous heart! I would trample upon it, I would feed it to dogs--!\" She paused. Her impotent fury was jerking at every muscle, was choking her. \"But I am only a woman. Simon, you used to love me. You cannot have forgotten, Simon. Oh, haven't you any pity on a woman? Remember, Simon--remember how happy we were! Don't you remember how the night-jars used to call to one another when we sat on moonlit evenings under the elm-tree? And d'ye remember the cottage we planned, Simon?--where we were going to live on bread and cheese and kisses? And how we quarrelled because I wanted to train vines over it? You said the rooms would be too dark. You said--oh, Simon, Simon! if only I had gone to live with you in that little cottage we planned and never builded!\" Lady Allonby was at his feet now. She fawned upon him in somewhat the manner of a spaniel expectant of a thrashing.  The Vicar of Heriz Magna"]]]
