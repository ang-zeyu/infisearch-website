There are two ways of asking a question: either to obtain information, or simply from idle curiosity, which is foolishness. Now pay attention, Rico: is this a mere idle question, or did somebody send you who wishes to buy a fiddle?\"  \"I want to buy one myself,\" said the boy, taking courage a little; but he was frightened when the angry reply came, \"What! what did you say? A forlorn little fellow like you buy a fiddle! Do you even know what the instrument is? Have you any idea of how old I was, and what I knew, before I obtained one? I was a teacher, a regular teacher; was twenty-two years old, with an assured profession, and not a child like you.  \"Now I will tell you what a fiddle costs, and then you will see how foolish you are. Six hard gulden I paid for mine. Can you realize what that means? We will separate it into blutsgers. If one gulden contains a hundred blutsgers, then six guldens will be equal to six times one hundred,--quickly, quickly! Now, Rico, you are generally ready enough.\"  \"Six hundred blutsgers,\" said the lad softly, for he was quite overpowered with the magnitude of this sum as compared with Stineli's twelve blutsgers.  \"And, moreover, my son, do you imagine that you have only to take a fiddle in your hand to be able to play on it at once? It takes a long time to do that. Come in here now, for a moment.\" And the teacher opened the door, and took his fiddle from its place on the wall. \"There,\" he said, as he placed it on Rico's arm, \"take the bow in your hand,--so, my boy; and if you can play me _c, d, e, f_, I will give you a half-gulden.\"  Rico had the fiddle really in his hand; his eyes sparkled with fire; _c, d, e, f,_--he played the notes firmly and perfectly correctly. \"You little rascal!\" cried the astonished teacher, \"where did you learn that? Who taught you? How do you find the notes?\"  \"I can do more than that, if I may,\" said the boy.  \"Play, then.\"  And Rico played correctly, and with enthusiasm,--    \"Little lambkins, come down   From the bright sunny height;   The daylight is fading,   The sun says, 'Good-night!'\"  [Illustration: RICO PLAYED CORRECTLY, AND WITH ENTHUSIASM]  The teacher sunk into a chair, and put his spectacles on his nose. His eyes rested on Rico's fingers as he played, then on his sparkling eyes, and again on his hands. When the air was finished, he said, \"Come here to me, Rico;\" and, moving his chair into the light, he placed the lad directly before him. \"Now I have something to say to you. Your father is an Italian; and I know that down there all sorts of things go on of which we have no idea here in the mountains. Now look me straight in the eye, and answer me truly and honestly. How did you learn to play this air so correctly?\"  Looking up with his honest eyes, the boy replied, \"I learned it from you, in the school where it is so often sung.\"  These words gave an entirely new aspect to the affair. The teacher stood up, and went back and forth several times in the room. Then he was himself the cause of this wonderful event; there was no necromancy concerned in it.  In a far better humor, he took out his purse, saying, \"Here is your half-gulden, Rico; it is justly yours. Now go; and for the future be very attentive to the music-lesson as long as you go to the school. In that way you may, perhaps, accomplish something; and in twelve or fourteen years perhaps you may be able to buy a fiddle. Now you may go.\"  Rico cast one look at the fiddle, and departed with deep sadness in his heart.  Stineli came running to meet him from behind the wood-pile. \"You did stay a long time. Have you asked the question?\"  \"It is all of no use,\" said the boy; and his eyebrows came together in his distress, and formed a thick black line across his forehead over his eyes. \"A fiddle costs six hundred blutsgers; and in fourteen years I can buy one, when everybody will be dead. Who will be living fourteen years from now? There, you may have this; I do not want it.\" With these words he pressed the half-gulden into Stineli's hand.  \"Six hundred blutsgers!\" repeated the girl, horrified. \"But where did this half-gulden come from?\"  Rico told her all that had happened at the teacher's, ending with the same words expressing his great regret, \"It is all of no use!\"  Stineli tried to console him a little with the half-gulden; but he was furious at the thought of the innocent piece of money, and would not even look at it.  So Stineli said, \"I will put it with my blutsgers, and we will have it all between us.\"  Stineli herself was very much discouraged now; but as they went around the corner into the field, the little pathway that led to their doors shone so prettily in the bright sunlight, and the plat before the houses was so white and dry, that she called out,--  \"See, see! now it is summer, Rico; and we can go up into the wood, and we will be happy again. Shall we go next Sunday?\"  \"Nothing will ever make me happy again,\" said Rico; \"but if you want to go, I will go with you.\"  When they reached the door, they had arranged to go to the wood on the following Sunday, and Stineli was very happy at the thought. She did all that she was able to do through the week, and there was a great deal of work for her. Peterli, Sami, and Urschli had the measles, and in the stable one of the goats was sick, and needed hot water very often; and Stineli had to run hither and thither, lending a helping hand in every direction as soon as she came home from school, and on Saturday all day long until late in the evening; and then there were the stable buckets to be cleaned. But that night her father said,--  \"Stineli _is_ a handy child.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE BEAUTIFUL DISTANT LAKE WITHOUT A NAME   When Stineli awoke on the following Sunday morning, she was conscious of an unusual light-heartedness, and at first could not understand the cause, until she remembered what day it was, and that her grandmother had said, on the previous evening, \"To-morrow you must have the whole afternoon to yourself: it is rightfully yours.\"  After dinner was finished, and all the dishes taken away, and the table washed off by Stineli, Peterli called out, \"Come here to me;\" and the two others screamed, \"No, to me!\" and her father said, \"Now Stineli must go to look after the goats.\"  But at this moment her grandmother went through the kitchen, and made a sign to Stineli to follow her.  \"Now go in peace, my child,\" she said. \"I will take care of the goats and the children; but be sure to come home, both of you, punctually when the bell rings for prayer.\" The grandmother knew very well that there were two of them.  Off flew Stineli, like a bird whose cage-door has suddenly been opened; and outside stood Rico, who had been waiting for a long time. They went on together, across the meadow towards the wood.  On the mountains the sun was shining brightly, and the blue heavens lay over all the landscape. They were obliged to pass, for a little while, through the shade in the snow; but the sun was shining a little farther on, and shimmered on the waters of the lake, and there were lovely dry spots on the slope that was almost hanging over the lake.  There the children seated themselves. A sharp wind came down from the heights, and whistled about their ears. Stineli was as happy as happy could be. She shouted out, again and again, \"Oh, look, Rico; look! How beautiful it is in the sun! Now summer has come, look how the lake glistens! There cannot be a more beautiful lake than this one anywhere,\" she said confidently.  \"Yes, yes, Stineli! You ought to see the lake I know about just once,\" said Rico; and looked so longingly across the lake, that it seemed as if that which he wanted to see began just beyond their vision.  \"Over there are no dark fir-trees, with sharp needles, but shining green leaves, and great red flowers; and the mountains are not so high and dark, nor so near, but lie off in the distance, and are purple; and the sky and the lake are all golden and still and warm. There the wind does not feel like this, and one's feet never get full of snow; and one can sit all day long on the sunny ground, and look about.\"  Stineli was quite carried away by this description. She already saw the red flowers and the golden lake before her eyes, and seemed to know exactly how beautiful it all was.  \"Perhaps you may be able to go there again to see it all, Rico. Do you know the way?\"  \"You must cross the Maloja. I have been there with my father once. He pointed me out the road that goes all the way down the mountain,--first this way, then that, and far below lies the lake; but so far, so far, that it is scarcely possible to go there.\"  \"Oh! that is easy enough,\" said Stineli. \"You have to go farther and farther, that is all; and at the end you will surely get there.\"  \"But my father told me something else. Do you know, Stineli, when you are travelling and stop at an inn, and eat something and sleep there, then there is something to pay, and you must have money for that.\"  \"Oh! we have lots of money,\" cried Stineli triumphantly. But her companion was not triumphant.  \"That is exactly as good as nothing. I know that by the affair of the fiddle,\" he said sadly.  \"Then it will be better for you to stay at home, Rico. Look! it is beautiful here at home, I am sure.\"  The lad sat thoughtfully silent for a long time, leaning his head on his hand, and his eyebrows brought in a close line down over his eyes. At last he turned again to Stineli, who had been gathering the soft green moss that grew around the spot where they were lying, and of which she made a tiny bed with two pillows and a coverlet. She meant to carry them home to the sick Urschli.  \"You say I had better stay at home, Stineli; but, do you know, it is just as if I did not know where my home really is.\"  \"Oh, dear me! what do you mean?\" cried the girl; and in her surprise she threw away a whole handful of moss. Your home is here, of course. It is always home"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9075"],["title","Rico and Wiseli (#3)"],["body","father and mother\"--She stopped suddenly. Rico had no mother, and his father had been away now for a very long time; and the cousin? Stineli never went near that cousin, who had never spoken one pleasant word to her. The child did not know what to say, but it was not natural to her to remain long in uncertainty. Rico had already fallen into one of his reveries, when she grasped him by the arm, and said,--  \"I should just like to know something; that is, the name of the lake where it is so lovely.\"  Rico pondered. \"I do not know,\" he said; and felt very much surprised himself as he spoke.  Now Stineli proposed that they should ask somebody what it was called; for even if Rico had ever so much money, and was able to travel, he must know how to inquire the way, and what the name of the lake was. They began at once to think of whom they should inquire,--of the teacher, or of the grandmother.  At last it occurred to Rico that his father would know better than anybody else, and he thought he would certainly ask him when he came home again.  The time had slipped away quickly as they sat talking, and presently the children heard the distant sound of a bell. They recognized the sound. It was the bell for prayers.  They sprang up quickly, and ran off, hand in hand, down the hill-side through bushes, and through the snow across the meadow; and it had scarcely stopped ringing when they reached the door where the grandmother was on the lookout for them.  Stineli had to go at once into the house, and her grandmother said quickly, \"Go home directly, Rico, and do not hang around the door any longer.\"  The grandmother had never said such a thing to him before, although he had always been in the habit of hanging around the door; for he was never in haste to go home, and stood always for a while before he could make up his mind to enter. He obeyed at once, however, and went into the house.     CHAPTER V.  A SAD HOUSE, BUT THE LAKE GETS A NAME.   Rico did not find his cousin in the sitting-room; so he went to the kitchen, and opened the door. There she stood; but before he could enter, she raised her finger, saying, \"Sch! sch! Do not open and shut the doors, and make a noise, as if there were four of you. Go into the other room, and keep still. Your father is lying in the bedroom up there. They brought him home in a wagon: he is sick.\"  Rico went into the room, seated himself on a bench, and did not stir.  He sat there for at least a half-hour. Presently he heard the cousin moving about in the kitchen. Then he thought that he would go up very softly, and peep into the bedroom. Perhaps his father would like something to eat: it was long past the meal-time.  He slipped behind the stove, mounted the little steps, and went very softly into the bedroom. After a while he returned, went at once into the kitchen, approached quite close to his cousin, and said softly,--  \"Cousin, come up.\"  The woman was about to strike him angrily, when she happened to glance at his face. He was perfectly colorless,--cheeks and lips as white as a sheet, and his eyes looked so black that the cousin was almost afraid of him.  \"What is the matter with you?\" she asked hastily, and followed him almost involuntarily.  He mounted the little steps softly, and entered the chamber. His father lay on the bed with staring, wide-open eyes,--he was dead.  \"Oh, my God!\" screamed the cousin, and ran crying out of the door that opened upon the passage on the other side of the room, went down the staircase, and across into the opposite house, where she called out to tell the neighbor and the grandmother the sad news; and thence she ran on to the teacher and to the mayor.  One after another they came, and entered the quiet room until it was full of people; for the news spread from one to another of what had taken place. And in the midst of all the tumult, and of all the clamor of the crowd of neighbors, Rico stood by the bedside speechless, motionless, and gazed at his father. All through the week the house was filled with people who wished to look at the man, and hear from the cousin how it had all happened; so that the lad heard it repeated over and over, that his father had been at work down in St. Gall on the railroad.  He had received a deep wound on the head when they were blasting a rock; and, as he could not work any longer, he wished to go home to take care of himself until the wound was healed. But the long journey--sometimes on foot, sometimes in an open wagon--was too much for him; and when he had reached his home on Sunday, towards evening, he had lain down on the bed never to rise again. Without any one knowing it, he had passed away; for he was already stiff when Rico had found him. On the following Sunday the burial took place. Rico was the only mourner to follow the coffin. Several kind neighbors joined in, and thus the little procession went on to Sils. In the church, Rico heard the pastor when he read out, \"The deceased was called Henrico Trevillo, and was a native of Peschiera on the Lake of Garda.\"  These words brought the feeling to Rico that he had heard something that he knew perfectly well before, and yet could not recollect. He had always seen a picture of the lake before his eyes when he had sung,--    \"One evening   In Peschiera,\"  with his father, but he had never known the reason. He repeated the name softly to himself, while one old song after another arose in his memory.  As he came back from the burial all alone, he saw the grandmother seated on the log of wood, and Stineli by her side. She beckoned him to come over to them. She gave the lad a bit of cake and another to Stineli, and said now they might go off together for a walk. Rico ought not to be alone.  So the children rambled off together, hand in hand. The grandmother remained seated on her log, sadly gazing after the black-haired lad until they had wandered slowly up the hillside and passed out of sight. Then she said softly to herself,--    \"Whate'er He does, or lets be done,   Is always for the best.\"     CHAPTER VI.  RICO'S MOTHER.   Along the road from Sils came the teacher leaning on his staff. He had assisted at the burial. He coughed and cleared his throat; and as he drew near to the grandmother and bade her \"good evening,\" he seated himself by her side. \"If you have no objection, I will sit here with you for a few moments, neighbor,\" said he; \"for I feel very badly in my throat and chest. But what can we expect when we are almost seventy years old, and have witnessed such a funeral as this one to-day? He was not thirty-five years of age, and as strong as a tree.\"  \"It always sets me thinking,\" said the grandmother, \"when I, an old woman of seventy-five years, am left, and here and there a young person is called away,--a useful one, too.\"  \"Yet the old folks are good for something. Who else can set an example to the youth?\" remarked the teacher. \"But what is your opinion, neighbor: what will become of the little fellow over yonder, do you think?\"  \"Yes, what will become of him?\" repeated the old woman. \"I also ask myself that question; and if my only reliance were upon human help, I should not know of an answer. But there is a heavenly Father who looks after the forsaken children. He will provide something for the lad.\"  \"Will you not tell me, neighbor, how it happened that the Italian married the daughter of your friend who lived over there opposite? One never knows how these people may turn out.\"  \"It happened as such things always happen, neighbor. You know how my old friend Anne-Dete had lost all her children, and her husband also, and lived alone in the cottage over yonder with Marie-Seppli, who was a merry little girl. About eleven or twelve years ago Trevillo made his appearance here. He had work in the Maloja, and came down here with the other boys; and he and Marie-Seppli had scarcely become acquainted before they were resolved to have each other.  \"And it must be said, in justice to Trevillo, that he was not only a handsome fellow who was agreeable to everybody, but also an industrious and well-conducted man, with whom Anne-Dete (the mother) was well pleased. Naturally she wished that they should stay in the house and live with her, and Trevillo would gladly have done so. He was fond of his wife's mother, and he always did as Marie-Seppli wished him to. He had taken her, however, towards the Maloja in his walks, and they had together looked down the road where you can see how far it goes winding down the mountain; and he had told her how every thing was down there where he was born. So Marie-Seppli got it into her head that she must go there, and no matter how much her mother worried and fretted, and said that they could not live there, she still was bent upon going; and Trevillo himself said that as to living there she need not fear, for he had a nice little property and a house; but, for his part, he would like to see a little of the world. But the bride prevailed, and after the wedding she was all for starting directly down the mountain.  \"She wrote to her mother occasionally that it was very nice where they lived, and that Trevillo was the best of husbands.  \"About five or six years later, who should walk into the room where Anne-Dete was sitting but Trevillo, leading a little boy by the hand. He said, 'There, mother, this is the only thing I have left of Marie-Seppli. She lies buried down yonder with her other little children. This one was her first, and her favorite.'  \"This is what my old friend told me. Then he threw himself down on the bench where he had first seen his wife, saying that he should like to make his home there with her and the boy, if she had no objection, for down below it was not possible for him to continue to live. This was joy and sorrow at the same time for Anne-Dete.  \"Little Rico was then about four years old,--a quiet, thoughtful boy, never noisy or mischievous, and the very apple of her eye; but she died in the course of a year,"]]]
