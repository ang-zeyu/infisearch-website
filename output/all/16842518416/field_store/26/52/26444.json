We have now perceived, that all the explanations commonly given of nature are mere  modes of imagining, and do not indicate the true nature of anything, but only the  constitution of the imagination; and, although they have names, as though they were entities, existing externally to the imagination, I call them entities imaginary rather than real;  and, therefore, all arguments against us drawn from such abstractions are easily rebutted.  Many argue in this way.  If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect  nature of God, why are there so many imperfections in nature?  such, for instance, as  things corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity, confusion, evil, sin, &c.  But  these reasoners are, as I have said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be  reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not more or less perfect,  according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind.  To those who ask why God  did not so create all men, that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but this:  because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of  perfection from highest to lowest; or, more strictly, because the laws of his nature are so  vast, as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence,  as I have shown in Prop. xvi.  Such are the misconceptions I have undertaken to note; if there are any more of the same  sort, everyone may easily dissipate them for himself with the aid of a little reflection.

The writer wishes frankly to say that, in some instances, he has followed the course which all historians are compelled to take by using his imagination to round out the picture. But he is able conscientiously to declare that in the substance of his narrative, as well as in every detail which is specifically described, he has followed faithfully the accounts of eyewitnesses, or of those who were in a position to know the truth of what they related.

Compasses, T-squares, rulers, protractors, and ellipsographs obeyed the touch of his fingers as if inspired with life.  The room around him was a jungle of terrestrial and celestial globes, chemists' retorts, tubes, pipes, and all the indescribable apparatus that modern science has invented, and which, to the uninitiated, seems as incomprehensible as the ancient paraphernalia of alchemists and astrologers. The walls were lined with book shelves, and adorned along the upper portions with the most extraordinary photographs and drawings. Even the ceiling was covered with charts, some representing the sky, while many others were geological and topographical pictures of the face of the earth.  Beside the drawing-board lay a pad of paper, and occasionally the little man nervously turned to this, and, grasping a long pencil, made elaborate calculations, covering the paper with a sprinkling of mathematical symbols that looked like magnified animalcula. While he worked, under a high light from a single window placed well up near the ceiling, his forehead contracted into a hundred wrinkles, his cheeks became feverous, his piercing eyes glowed with inner fire, and drops of perspiration ran down in front of his ears. One would have thought that he was laboring to save his very soul and had but a few seconds of respite left.  Presently he threw down the pencil, and with astonishing agility let himself rapidly, but carefully, off the stool on which he had been sitting, keeping the palms of his hands on the seat beside his hips until he felt his feet touch the floor. Then he darted at a book-shelf, pulled down a ponderous tome, flapped it open in a clear space on the floor, and dropped on his knees to consult it.  After turning a leaf or two he found what he was after, read down the page, keeping a finger on the lines, and, having finished his reading, jumped to his feet and hurried back to the stool, on which he mounted so quickly that it was impossible to see how he managed it--without an upset. Instantly he made a new diagram, and then fell to figuring furiously on the pad, making his pencil gyrate so fast that its upper end vibrated like the wing of a dragon-fly.  At last he threw down the pencil, and, encircling his knees with his clasped arms, sank in a heap on the stool. The lids dropped over his shining eyes, and he became buried in thought.  When he reopened his eyes and unbent his brows, his gaze happened to be directed toward a row of curious big photographs which ran like a pictured frieze round the upper side of the wall of the room. A casual observer might have thought that the little man had been amusing himself by photographing the explosions of fireworks on a Fourth of July night; but it was evident by his expression that these singular pictures had no connection with civic pyrotechnics, but must represent something of incomparably greater importance, and, in fact, of stupendous import.  The little man's face took on a rapt look, in which wonder and fear seemed to be blended. With a sweep of his hand he included the whole series of photographs in a comprehensive glance, and then, settling his gaze upon a particularly bizarre object in the center, he began to speak aloud, although there was nobody to listen to him.  \"My God!\" he said. \"That's it! That Lick photograph of the Lord Rosse Nebula is its very image, except that there's no electric fire in it. The same great whirl of outer spirals, and then comes the awful central mass--and we're going to plunge straight into it. Then quintillions of tons of water will condense on the earth and cover it like a universal cloudburst. And then good-by to the human race--unless--unless--I, Cosmo Versál, inspired by science, can save a remnant to repeople the planet after the catastrophe.\"  Again, for a moment, he closed his eyes, and puckered his hemispherical brow, while, with drawn-up knees, he seemed perilously balanced on the high stool. Several times he slowly shook his head, like a dreaming owl, and when his eyes reopened their fire was gone, and a reflective film covered them. He began to speak, more deliberately than before, and in a musing tone:  \"What can I do? I don't believe there is a mountain on the face of the globe lofty enough to lift its head above that flood. Hum, hum! It's no use thinking about mountains! The flood will be six miles deep--six miles from the present sea-level; my last calculation proves it beyond all question. And that's only a minimum--it may be miles deeper, for no mortal man can tell exactly what'll happen when the earth plunges into a nebula.  \"We'll have to float; that's the thing. I'll have to build an ark. I'll be a second Noah. But I'll advise the whole world to build arks.  \"Millions might save themselves that way, for the flood is not going to last forever. We'll get through the nebula in a few months, and then the waters will gradually recede, and the high lands will emerge again. It'll be an awful long time, though; I doubt if the earth will ever be just as it was before. There won't be much room, except for fish--but there won't be many inhabitants for what dry land there is.\"  Once more he fell into silent meditation, and while he mused there came a knock at the door. The little man started up on his seat, alert as a squirrel, and turned his eyes over his shoulder, listening intently. The knock was repeated--three quick sharp raps. Evidently he at once recognized them.  \"All right,\" he called out, and, letting himself down, ran swiftly to the door and opened it.  A tall, thin man, with bushy black hair, heavy eyebrows, a high, narrow forehead, and a wide, clean shaven mouth, wearing a solemn kind of smile, entered and grasped the little man by both hands.  \"Cosmo,\" he said, without wasting any time on preliminaries, \"have you worked it out?\"  \"I have just finished.\"  \"And you find the worst?\"  \"Yes, worse than I ever dreamed it would be. The waters will be six miles deep.\"  \"Phew!\" exclaimed the other, his smile fading. \"That is indeed serious. And when does it begin?\"  \"Inside of a year. We're within three hundred million miles of the watery nebula now, and you know that the earth travels more than that distance in twelve months.\"  \"Have you seen it?\"  \"How could I see it--haven't I told you it is invisible? If it could be seen all these stupid astronomers would have spotted it long ago. But I'll tell you what I have seen.\"  Cosmo Versál's voice sank into a whisper, and he shuddered slightly as he went on:  \"Only last night I was sweeping the sky with the telescope when I noticed, in Hercules and Lyra, and all that part of the heavens, a dimming of some of the fainter stars. It was like the shadow of the shroud of a ghost. Nobody else would have noticed it, and I wouldn't if I had not been looking for it. It's knowledge that clarifies the eyes and breeds knowledge, Joseph Smith. It was not truly visible, and yet I could see that it was there. I tried to make out the shape of the thing--but it was too indefinite. But I know very well what it is. See here\"--he suddenly broke off--\"Look at that photograph.\" (He was pointing at the Lord Rosse Nebula on the wall). \"It's like that, only it's coming edgewise toward us. We may miss some of the outer spirals, but we're going smash into the center.\"  With fallen jaw, and black brows contracted, Joseph Smith stared at the photograph.  \"It doesn't shine like that,\" he said at last.  The little man snorted contemptuously.  \"What have I told you about its invisibility?\" he demanded.  \"But how, then, do you know that it is of a watery nature?\""]]]
