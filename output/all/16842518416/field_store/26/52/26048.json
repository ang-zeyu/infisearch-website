He never failed to remember that his white skin could endure more than their sunburned dark ones.  The young school-teacher had no scruples on applying the rod. He selected his switches with care, and tested their strength and flexibility while he gave the bunch a piece of his mind.  \"What do you think I'm coming down here every night for, anyhow?\" he stormed.  \"Lordy, Marse Rooney,\" Sam pleaded, \"doan we all pay you fur our schoolin'?\"  \"Yes, you do when I can manage to choke it out of you. One dozen eggs a month or one pullet every two months. And I don't even ask you where you got the eggs or the pullet.\"  \"Marse Rooney!\" protested Sam. \"Yer know we gets 'em outen our own yards er buys 'em from de servants.\"  \"I hope you do. Though my mother says she don't know how we eat so many chickens and eggs at the house. Anyhow I'm not here because I'm going to get rich on the tuition you pay me. I'm not here for my health. I'm here from a sense of duty to you boys--\"  \"Yassah, we know dat, sah!\"  \"Give us annuder chance an' we sho' study dem lessons--\"  \"I gave you another chance the last time. I'll try a little hickory tea this time.\"  He began at the end of the line and belabored each one faithfully. They shouted in mockery and roared with laughter, scampered over the room and dodged behind chairs and tables.  Phil fairly split his sides laughing.  When the fun was over, they drew close to their teacher and promised faithfully to have every word of the next lesson. They nudged each other and whispered their jokes about the beating.  \"Must er bin er flea bitin' me!\"  \"I felt sumfin. Don't 'zactly know what it wuz. Mebbe a chigger!\"  \"Must er been a flea. Hit bit me, too!\"  Sam tried to redeem himself for failing on his lessons in arithmetic. He had long ago learned to read and write and had asked for a course in history. The young teacher had given him a copy of _Gulliver's Travels_.  \"Look a here, Marse Rooney, I been a readin' dat book yer gimme--\"  \"Well, that's good.\"  \"Yer say dat book's history?\"  \"Well, it's what we call fiction, but I think fiction's the very best history we can read. It may not have happened just that way but it's true all the same.\"  \"Well, ef hit nebber happened, I dunno 'bout dat,\" Sam objected. \"I been suspicionin' fer a long time dat some o' dem things that Gulliver say nebber happen nohow.\"  \"You read it,\" the teacher ordered.  \"Yassah, I sho gwine ter read it, happen er no happen. Glory be ter God. Just 'cause yer tells me, sah!\"    CHAPTER VI   The next morning found Phil walking again between the white, clean rows of the quarter houses. He was always finding something to interest him. Every yard had its gorgeous red autumn flowers. Some of them had roses in bloom. The walks from the gate to the door were edged with white-washed bricks or conch shells. The conch shells were souvenirs of summer outings at the seashore.  In the corner of the back yard there was the tall pole on which were hung five or six dried gourds with tiny holes cut in the sides for the martins. And every gourd had its black family. The martins were the guardians of the servants' chicken yards. The hawks were numerous and the woods close to the quarters. Few chickens were lost by hawks. The martins circled the skies in battalions, watching, chattering, guarding, basking in the southern sun.  At noon the assembly bell rang at the end of the Broadway of the quarters. From every cottage, from field and stable, blacksmith shop, carpenter's shop, the house of the spinners, the weavers, the dairy, the negroes poured toward the shed beside the bell tower.  \"What is it?\" Phil asked of Custis.  \"Saturday noon. All work stops.\"  \"My Lord, it's been raining nearly all morning. The field hands haven't worked a lick all day. Do they stop, too?\"  \"It's the unwritten law of the South. We would no more think of working on Saturday afternoon than on Sunday.\"  \"What are they gathering under that shed for?\" Phil inquired.  Custis led him to the shed where Ike, the foreman, stood with Mrs. Lee beside a long table on which were piled the provisions for the week to follow.  The negroes laughed and chattered like a flock of blackbirds picking grain in a wheat field. To each head of a family was given six pounds of meat for each person. A father, mother and two children received twenty-four pounds. Their bread was never rationed. The barrel in each cottage was filled from the grist mill, a bag full at a time. They had their own garden and flocks of chickens. Sugar, coffee and molasses were given on the first of each month.  \"Come right back here now all ob you!\" Ike shouted, \"des ez quick ez yer put yo vittles away. De Missis gwine gib ye yo' winter close now, case she gwine ter Wes' Pint next week.\"  The provisions were swept from the long table. Out of the storehouse came huge piles of clothing and blankets. Each package was marked with the owner's name.  To each pair, man and wife, or two children, was given a new wool blanket. This was, of course, added to the stock each house had already. A woolen blanket was good for ten years' wear. Many a servant's house had a dozen blankets for each bed. Besides the blankets, to every woman with a baby was given a quilted comfort.  To each man, woman and child were allotted two complete woolen suits for the winter, a new pair of shoes and three pairs of stockings. In the spring two suits of cotton would be given for summer. The thrifty ones had their cedar chests piled with clothes. Many had not worn the suits given out a year ago.  The heads of large families trudged away with six or seven blankets, a comfort, and twenty suits of clothes. It sometimes took the father, mother and two of the children to carry the load.  But the most amazing thing which Phil saw was the sudden transformation of the shed into a market for the sale of slave produce to the mistress of Arlington.  Mrs. Lee had watched the distribution of clothes, blankets, quilts, shoes and stockings for the winter and then became the purchaser of all sorts of little luxuries which the slave had made in his leisure hours on Saturday afternoons and at night. The little boys and girls sold her dried wild fruits. The women had made fine jellies. They all had chickens and eggs to sell to the big house. Some had become experts in making peanut brittle and fudge.  They not only sold their wares here, but they also sold them in the market in Washington. The old men were expert basket and broom makers. The slaves made so much extra money on their chickens, peanuts, popcorn, fudge, brittle, molasses cakes, baskets, brooms, mats and taking in sewing, that they were able to buy many personal luxuries. Phil observed one dusky belle already arrayed in a silk dress for the Saturday afternoon outing with her beau. A few of them had their Sunday dresses made by fashionable mantua makers in Washington.  In addition to the regular distribution of clothing, the household supplied to the servants in rapid succession everything worn by master, mistress, son or daughter. Knowing that their clothes were being watched and guarded by longing eyes, they never wore them very long. Mary Lee was distributing a dozen dresses now to the girls. They had been made within the past year.  Phil observed Sam arrayed in a swallowtail coat of immaculate cut stroll by with his best girl. She was dressed in silk with full hoop-skirts, ruffles, ribbons and flowers.  Sid annoyed Sam by calling loudly:  \"Doan yer stay too late ter dat party. Ef ye do I'll hatter sing fur ye--    \"Run, nigger, run, de patterole ketch you.   Nigger run, de nigger flew,   De nigger loss his best ole shoe!   Run, nigger, run. Run, nigger, run. Run, nigger, run.\"  Sam waved his arm in a long laugh.  \"Dey won't git me, chile. I'se er conjur man, I is!\"  Phil had supposed the patrol of the mysterious mounted police of the South--the men who rode at night--were to the slave always a tragic terror.  It seemed a thing for joke and ribald song.  After lunch, the negroes entered on the afternoon's fun or work. The industrious ones plied their trades to earn money for luxuries. The boys who loved to fish and hunt rabbits hurried to the river and the fields. There was always a hound at their service for a rabbit hunt on Saturday afternoons. Some were pitching horse shoes. Two groups began to play marbles.  The marketing done for the house, the mistress of Arlington, with medicine case in hand, started on her round of healing for body and mind. Mary offered to go with her but the mother saw Stuart hovering about and quietly answered:  \"No. You can comfort poor Jeb. He looks disconsolate.\"  Into every cottage she moved, a quiet, ministering angel. Every hope and fear of ailing young or old found in her an ear to hear, a heart to pity and an arm to save.  If she found a case of serious illness, a doctor was called and a nurse set to watch by the bedside. Every delicacy and luxury the big house held was at the command of the sufferer and that without stint.  In all these clean flower-set cottages there was not a single crippled servant maimed in the service of his master. No black man or woman was allowed to do dangerous work. All dangerous tasks were done by hired white laborers. They were hired by the day under contract through their boss. Even ditches on the farm if they ran through swamp lands infested by malaria, were dug by white hired labor. The master would not permit his slave to take such risks.  But the most important ministry of the mistress of Arlington was in the medicine for the soul which she brought to the life and character of each servant for whose training she had accepted responsibility.  To her even the master proudly and loyally yielded authority. Her sway over the servants was absolute in its spiritual power. Into their souls in hours of trial she poured the healing and inspiration of a beautiful spirit. The mistress of Arlington was delicate and frail"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8462"],["title","The Man in Gray: A Romance of North and South (#6)"],["body","body. But out of her physical suffering the spirit rose to greater heights with each day's duty and service.  This mysterious power caught the warm imagination of the negroes. They were \"servants\" to others. They were her _slaves_ and they rejoiced in the bond that bound them. They knew that her body had no rest from morning until far into the hours of the night if one of her own needed care. The master could shift his responsibility to a trained foreman. No forewoman could take her place. To the whole scheme of life she gave strength and beauty. The beat of her heart made its wheels go round.  The young Westerner studied her with growing admiration and pity. She was the mistress of an historic house. She was the manager of an estate. She was the counselor of every man, woman and child in happiness or in sorrow. She was an accomplished doctor. She was a trained nurse. She taught the hearts of men and women with a wisdom more profound and searching than any preacher or philosopher from his rostrum. She had mastered the art of dressmaking and the tailor's trade. She was an expert housekeeper. She lived at the beck and call of all. She was idolized by her husband. Her life was a supreme act of worship--a devotion to husband, children, friends, the poor, the slave that made her a high-priestess of humanity.  The thing that struck Phil with terrific force was that this beautiful delicate woman was the slave of slaves.  As a rule, they died young.  He began to wonder how a people of the intelligence of these proud white Southerners could endure such a thing as Slavery. Its waste, its extravagance, its burdens were beyond belief.  He laughed when he thought of his mother crying over _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. Yet a new edition of a hundred thousand copies had just come from the press.  Early Sunday morning Custis asked him to go down to the quarters to see Uncle Ben, the butler, who had not yet resumed his duties. He had sent an urgent message to his young master asking him to be kind enough to call on Sunday. The message was so formal and reserved Custis knew it was of more than usual importance.  They found the old man superintending a special breakfast of fried fish for two little boys, neatly served at a table with spotless cloth. Robbie and his friend, John Doyle, were eating the fish they had caught with Uncle Ben the day before. They were as happy as kings and talked of fish and fishing with the unction of veteran sportsmen.  The greeting to Custis was profound in its courtesy and reverence. He was the first born of the great house. He was, therefore, the prospective head of the estate. Jeffersonian Democrats had long ago abolished the old English law of primogeniture. But the idea was in the blood of the Virginia planter. The servants caught it as quickly as they caught the other English traits of love of home, family, kin, the cult of leisure, the habit of Church, the love of country. It was not an accident that the decisions of the courts of the Old South were quoted by English barristers and accepted by English judges as law. The Common Law of England was the law of Southern Seaboard States. It always had been and it is to-day.  \"How is you dis mornin', Marse Custis?\" Ben asked with a stately bow.  \"Fine, Uncle Ben. I hope you're better?\"  \"Des tolerble, sah, des tolerble--\" he paused and bowed to Phil. \"An' dis is you' school-mate at Wes' Pint, dey tells me about?\"  \"Yes, Uncle,\" Phil answered.  \"I'se glad ter welcome yer ter Arlington, sah. And I'se powerful sorry I ain't able ter be in de big house ter see dat yer git ebry thing ter make yer happy, sah. Dese here young niggers lak Sam do pooty well. But dey ain't got much sense, sah. And dey ain't got no unction'tall. Dey do de best dey kin an' dat ain't much.\"  \"Oh, I'm having a fine time, Uncle Ben,\" Phil assured him.  \"Praise de Lord, sah.\"  \"Sam told me you wanted to see me, Uncle Ben,\" Custis said.  \"'Bout sumfin mos' particular, sah--\"  \"At your service.\"  The old man waved to his wife to look after the boys' breakfast.  \"Pile dem fish up on der plates, Hannah. Fill 'em up--fill'em up!\"  \"We're mos' full now!\" Robbie shouted.  \"No we ain't,\" John protested. \"I jis begun.\"  Ben led the young master and his friend out the back door, past the long pile of cord wood, past the chicken yard to a strong box which he had built on tall legs under a mulberry tree. It was constructed of oak and the neatly turned gable roof was covered with old tin carefully painted with three coats of red. A heavy hasp, staple and padlock held the solid door.  Ben fumbled in his pocket, drew forth his keys and opened it. The box was his fireproof and ratproof safe in which the old man kept his valuables. His money, his trinkets, his hammer and nails, augur and bits, screwdriver and monkeywrench. From the top shelf he drew a tin can. A heavy piece of linen tied with a string served as a cover.  He carefully untied the string in silence. He shook the can. The boys saw that it was filled with salt of the coarse kind used to preserve meats.  Ben felt carefully in the salt, drew forth a shriveled piece of dark gristle, and held it up before his young master.  \"Yer know what dat is, Marse Custis?\"  Custis shook his head.  From the old man's tones of deep emotion he knew the matter was serious. He thought at once of the Hoodoo. But he could make out no meaning to this bit of preserved flesh.  \"Never saw anything like it.\"  \"Nasah. I spec yer didn't.\"  Ben pushed the gray hair back from his left ear. He wore his hair drawn low over the tips of his ears. It was a fad of his, which he never allowed to lapse.  \"See anything funny 'bout de top o' dat year, sah?\"  Custis looked carefully.  \"It looks shorter--\"  \"Hit's er lot shorter. De top ob hit's clean gone, sah. Dat's why I allus combs my ha'r down close over my years--\"  He paused and held up the piece of dried flesh.  \"An' dat's hit, sah.\"  \"A piece of your ear?\"  \"Hit sho is. Ye see, sah, a long time ergo when I wuz young an' strong ez er bull, one er dese here uppish niggers come ter our house drivin' a carriage frum Westover on de James, an' 'gin ter brag 'bout his folks bein' de bes' blood er ole Virginia. An' man I tells him sumfin. I tells dat fool nigger dat de folks at Westover wuz des fair ter midlin. Dat _our_ folks wuz, an' allus wuz, de very fust fambly o' Virginy! I tells him, dat Marse Robert's father was General Light Horse Harry Lee dat help General Washington wid de Revolution. Dat he wuz de Govenor o' ole Virginy. Dat he speak de piece at de funeral o' George Washington, dat we all knows by heart, now--  \"'Fust in war, fust in peace and fust in de hearts o' his countrymen.'  \"I tells him dat Marse Robert's mother wuz a Carter. I tells him dat he could count more dan one hundred gemmen his kin. Dat his folks allus had been de very fust fambly in Virginy. I tells him dat he marry my Missis, de gran' daughter o' ole Gineral Washington his-salf--an' en--\"  He paused.  \"An' den, what ye reckon dat fool nigger say ter me?\"  \"Couldn't guess.\"  \"He say General Washington nebber had no children. And den man, man, when he insult me lak dat, I jump on him lak a wil' cat. We fought an' we fit. We fit an' we fought. I got him down an' bit one o' his years clean off smooth wid his head. In de las' clinch he git hol' er my lef year a'fo' I could shake him, he bit de top of hit off, sah. I got him by the froat an' choke hit outen his mouf. And dar hit is, sah.\"  He held up the dried piece of his ear reverently.  \"And what do you want me to do with it, Uncle Ben?\" Custis asked seriously.  \"Nuttin right now, sah. But I ain't got long ter live--\"  \"Oh, you'll be well in a few days, Uncle Ben.\"  \"I mought an' den agin I moughtent. I been lyin' awake at night worryin' 'bout dat year o' mine. Ye see hit wouldn't do tall fur me ter go walkin' dem golden streets up dar in Heben wid one o' my years lopped off lake a shoat er a calf dat's been branded. Some o' dem niggers standin' on dat gol' sidewalk would laugh at me. An' dat would hurt my feelin's. Some smart Aleck would be sho ter holler, 'Dar come ole Ben. But he ain't got but one year!' Dat wouldn't do, tall, sah.\"  Phil bit his lips to keep from laughing. He saw the thing was no joke for the old man. It was a grim tragedy.  \"What I wants ter axe, Marse Custis, is dat you promise me faithful, ez my young master, dat when I die you come to me, get dis year o' mine outen dis salt box an' stick hit back right whar it b'long 'fore dey nail me up in de coffin. I des can't 'ford ter walk down dem golden streets, 'fore all dat company, wid a piece er my year missin'. Will ye promise me, sah?\"  Custis grasped the outstretched hand and clasped it.  \"I promise you, Uncle Ben, faithfully.\"  \"Den hit's all right, sah. When a Lee make a promise, hit's des ez good ez done. I know dat case I know who I'se er talkin' to.\"  He placed the piece of gristle back into the tin can, covered it with salt, tied the linen cover over it carefully, put it back on the shelf, locked the heavy oak door and handed Custis the key.  \"I got annudder key. You keep dat one, please, sah.\"  Custis and Phil left the old man more cheerful than he had been for days.    CHAPTER VII   As the sun was sinking across the gray waters of the river, reflecting in its silver surface a riot of purple and scarlet, the master of Arlington sat in thoughtful silence holding the fateful Book of the Slave in his hand. He had promised his friend, Edmund Ruffin, to give him an answer early next week as to a public statement.  He was puzzled as to his duty. To his ready protest that he was not a politician his friend had instantly replied that his word would have ten times the weight for that reason. So deep was his brooding he did not notice the two boys in a heated argument at the corner of the house.  Robbie Lee had drawn his barefoot friend, John, thus far. He had balked and refused to go farther.  \"Come on, John,\" Robbie pleaded.  \"I'm"]]]
