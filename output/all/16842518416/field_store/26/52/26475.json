Yet, while they uttered this exclamation, the young man and the Lily turned an apprehensive glance at their dreary associate, deeming it hardly possible, that some tale of earthly affliction should not make those precincts loathsome, as in every former case.  The old man stood just behind them, so as to form the chief figure in the group, with his sable cloak muffling the lower part of his visage, and his sombre list overshadowing his brows.  But he gave no word of dissent from their purpose; and an inscrutable smile was accepted by the lovers as a token that here had been no footprint of guilt or sorrow, to desecrate the site of their Temple of Happiness.  In a little time longer, while summer was still in its prime, the fairy structure of the Temple arose on the summit of the knoll, amid the solemn shadows of the trees, yet often gladdened with bright sunshine.  It was built of white marble, with slender and graceful pillars, supporting a vaulted dome; and beneath the centre of this dome, upon a pedestal, was a slab of dark-veined marble, on which books and music might be strewn.  But there was a fantasy among the people of the neighborhood, that the edifice was planned after an ancient mausoleum, and was intended for a tomb, and that the central slab of dark-veined marble was to be inscribed with the names of buried ones.  They doubted, too, whether the form of Lilias Fay could appertain to a creature of this earth, being so very delicate, and growing every day more fragile, so that she looked as if the summer breeze should snatch her up, and waft her heavenward.  But still she watched the daily growth of the Temple; and so did old Walter Gascoigne, who now made that spot his continual haunt, leaning whole hours together on his staff, and giving as deep attention to the work as though it had been indeed a tomb.  In due time it was finished, and a day appointed for a simple rite of dedication.  On the preceding evening, after Adam Forrester had taken leave of his mistress, he looked back towards the portal of her dwelling, and felt a strange thrill of fear; for he imagined that, as the setting sunbeams faded from her figure, she was exhaling away, and that something of her ethereal substance was withdrawn, with each lessening gleam of light.  With his farewell glance, a shadow had fallen over the portal, and Lilias was invisible.  His foreboding spirit deemed it an omen at the time; and so it proved; for the sweet earthly form, by which the Lily bad been manifested to the world, was found lifeless, the next morning, in the Temple, with her head resting on her arms, which were folded upon the slab of dark-veined marble.  The chill winds of the earth had long since breathed a blight into this beautiful flower, so that a loving hand had now transplanted it, to blossom brightly in the garden of Paradise.  But, alas for the Temple of Happiness!  In his unutterable grief, Adam Forrester had no purpose more at heart than to convert this Temple of many delightful hopes into a tomb, and bury his dead mistress there. And to! a wonder!  Digging a grave beneath the Temple’s marble floor, the sexton found no virgin earth, such as was meet to receive the maiden’s dust, but an ancient sepulchre, in which were treasured up the bones of generations that had died long ago.  Among those forgotten ancestors was the Lily to be laid.  And when the funeral procession brought Lilias thither in her coffin, they beheld old Walter Gascoigne standing beneath the dome of the Temple, with his cloak of pall, and face of darkest gloom; and wherever that figure might take its stand, the spot would seem a sepulchre.  He watched the mourners as they lowered the coffin down.  “And so,” said he to Adam Forrester, with the strange smile in which his insanity was wont to gleam forth, “you have found no better foundation for your happiness than on a grave!”  But as the Shadow of Affliction spoke, a vision of Hope and Joy had its birth in Adam’s mind, even from the old man’s taunting words; for then he knew what was betokened by the parable in which the Lily and himself had acted; and the mystery of Life and Death was opened to him.  “Joy! joy!”  he cried, throwing his arms towards Heaven, “on a grave be the site of our Temple; and now our happiness is for Eternity!”  With those words, a ray of sunshine broke through the dismal sky, and glimmered down into the sepulchre; while, at the same moment, the shape of old Walter Gascoigne stalked drearily away, because his gloom, symbolic of all earthly sorrow, might no longer abide there, now that the darkest riddle of humanity was read."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9218"],["title","Footprints on the Sea-Shore (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#0)"],["body","TOLD TALES                     FOOTPRINTS ON THE SEA-SHORE                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne    It must be a spirit much unlike my own, which  can keep itself in health and vigor without sometimes stealing from the sultry sunshine of the world, to plunge into the cool bath of solitude. At  intervals, and not infrequent ones, the forest and the ocean summon me--one with the roar of its waves, the other with the murmur of its boughs--forth from the  haunts of men.  But I must wander many a mile, ere I could stand beneath the shadow of even one primeval tree, much less be lost among the multitude of hoary trunks, and hidden from earth and sky by the mystery  of darksome foliage.  Nothing is within my daily reach more like a forest than the acre or two of woodland near some suburban farm-house. When, therefore, the yearning for seclusion becomes a necessity within me, I am  drawn to the sea-shore, which extends its line of rude rocks and seldom-trodden sands, for leagues around our bay.  Setting forth at my last ramble, on a September  morning, I bound myself with a hermit's vow, to interchange no thoughts with man or woman, to share no social pleasure, but to derive all that day's enjoyment from shore, and sea, and sky,--from my soul's communion with these, and from fantasies, and recollections, or anticipated realities.  Surely here is enough to feed a human spirit for a single day.  Farewell, then, busy world!  Till your evening lights shall shine along the street,--till they gleam upon my sea-flushed face, as I tread homeward,--free me from your ties, and let me be a peaceful outlaw.  Highways and cross-paths are hastily traversed, and, clambering down a crag, I find myself at the extremity of a long beach.  How gladly does the spirit leap forth, and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to the full extent of the broad, blue, sunny deep!  A greeting and a homage to the Sea!  I descend over its margin, and dip my hand into the wave that meets me, and bathe my brow.  That far-resounding roar is Ocean's voice of welcome.  His salt breath brings a blessing along with it. Now let us pace together--the reader's fancy arm in arm with mine--this noble beach, which extends a mile or more from that craggy promontory to yonder rampart of broken rocks.  In front, the sea; in the rear, a precipitous bank, the grassy verge of which is breaking away, year after year, and flings down its tufts of verdure upon the barrenness below.  The beach itself is a broad space of sand, brown and sparkling, with hardly any pebbles intermixed.  Near the water's edge there is a wet margin, which glistens brightly in the sunshine, and reflects objects like a mirror; and as we tread along the glistening border, a dry spot flashes around each footstep, but grows moist again, as we lift our feet.  In some spots, the sand receives a complete impression of the sole, square toe and all; elsewhere it is of such marble firmness, that we must stamp heavily to leave a print even of the iron-shod heel.  Along the whole of this extensive beach gambols the surf wave: now it makes a feint of dashing onward in a fury, yet dies away with a meek murmur, and does but kiss the strand; now, after many such abortive efforts, it rears itself up in an unbroken line, heightening as it advances, without a speck of foam on its green crest.  With how fierce a roar it flings itself forward, and rushes far up the beach!  As I threw my eyes along the edge of the surf, I remember that I was startled, as Robinson Crusoe might have been, by the sense that human life was within the magic circle of my solitude.  Afar off in the remote distance of the beach, appearing like sea-nymphs, or some airier things, such as might tread upon the feathery spray, was a group of girls.  Hardly had I beheld them, when they passed into the shadow of the rocks and vanished.  To comfort myself--for truly I would fain have gazed a while longer--I made acquaintance with a flock of beach birds.  These little citizens of the sea and air preceded me by about a stone's-throw along the strand, seeking, I suppose, for food upon its margin.  Yet, with a philosophy which mankind would do well to imitate, they drew a continual pleasure from their toil for a subsistence.  The sea was each little bird's great playmate. They chased it downward as it swept back, and again ran up swiftly before the impending wave, which sometimes overtook them and bore them off their feet.  But they floated as lightly as one of their own feathers on the breaking crest.  In their airy flutterings, they seemed to rest on the evanescent spray.  Their images--long-legged little figures, with gray backs and snowy bosoms--were seen as distinctly as the realities in the mirror of the glistening strand.  As I advanced, they flew a score or two of yards, and, again alighting, recommenced their dalliance with the surf wave; and thus they bore me company along the beach, the types of pleasant fantasies, till, at its extremity, they took wing over the ocean, and were gone.  After forming a friendship with these small surf-spirits, it is really worth a sigh, to find no memorial of them, save their multitudinous little tracks in the sand.  When we have paced the length of the beach, it is pleasant, and not unprofitable, to retrace our steps, and recall the whole mood and occupation of the mind during the former passage.  Our tracks, being all discernible, will guide us with an observing consciousness through every unconscious wandering of thought and fancy.  Here we followed the surf in its reflux, to pick up a shell which the sea seemed loath to relinquish.  Here we found a sea-weed, with an immense brown leaf, and trailed it behind us by its long snake-like stalk.  Here we seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and counted the many claws of the queer monster.  Here we dug into the sand for pebbles, and skipped them upon the surface of the water.  Here we wet our feet while examining a jelly-fish, which the waves, having just tossed it up, now sought to snatch away again.  Here we trod along the brink of a fresh-water brooklet, which flows across the beach, becoming shallower and more shallow, till at last it sinks into the sand, and perishes in the effort to bear its little tribute to the main.  Here some vagary appears to have bewildered us; for our tracks go round and round, and are confusedly intermingled, as if we had found a labyrinth upon the level beach.  And here, amid our idle pastime, we sat down upon almost the only stone that breaks the surface of the sand, and were lost in an unlooked-for and overpowering conception of the majesty and awfulness of the great deep.  Thus, by tracking our footprints in the sand, we track our own nature in its wayward course, and steal a glance upon it, when it never dreams of being so observed.  Such glances always make us wiser.  This extensive beach affords room for another pleasant pastime. With your staff you may write verses--love-verses, if they please you best--and consecrate them with a woman's name.  Here, too, may be inscribed thoughts, feelings, desires, warm out-gushings from the heart's secret places, which you would not pour upon the sand without the certainty that, almost ere the sky has looked upon them, the sea will wash them out.  Stir not hence till the record be effaced.  Now--for there is room enough on your canvas--draw huge faces,--huge as that of the Sphinx on Egyptian sands,--and fit them with bodies of corresponding immensity, and legs which might stride half-way to yonder island. Child's play becomes magnificent on so grand a scale.  But, after all, the most fascinating employment is simply to write your name in the sand.  Draw the letters gigantic, so that two strides may barely measure them, and three for the long strokes!  Cut deep, that the record may be permanent!  Statesmen, and warriors, and poets have spent their strength in no better cause than this.  Is it accomplished?  Return, then, in an hour or two, and seek for this mighty record of a name.  The sea will have swept over it, even as time rolls its effacing waves over the names of statesmen, and warriors, and poets.  Hark, the surf wave laughs at you!  Passing from the beach, I begin to clamber over the crags, making my difficult way among the ruins of a rampart, shattered and broken by the assaults of a fierce enemy.  The rocks rise in every variety of attitude; some of them have their feet in the foam, and are shagged half-way upward with sea-weed; some have been hollowed almost into caverns by the unwearied toil of the sea, which can afford to spend centuries in wearing away a rock, or even polishing a pebble.  One huge rock ascends in monumental shape, with a face like a giant's tombstone, on which the veins resemble inscriptions, but in an unknown tongue.  We will fancy them the forgotten characters of an antediluvian race; or else that Nature's own hand has here recorded a mystery, which, could I read her language, would make mankind the wiser and the happier.  How many a thing has troubled me with that same idea! Pass on, and leave it unexplained.  Here is a narrow avenue, which might seem to have been hewn through the very heart of an enormous crag, affording passage for the rising sea to thunder back and forth, filling it with tumultuous foam, and then leaving its floor of black pebbles bare and glistening.  In this chasm there was once an intersecting vein of softer stone, which the waves have gnawed away piecemeal, while the granite walls remain entire on either side.  How sharply, and with what harsh clamor, does the sea rake hack the pebbles, as it momentarily withdraws into its own depths!  At intervals, the floor of the chasm is left nearly dry; but anon, at the outlet, two or three great waves are seen struggling to get in at once; two hit the walls athwart, while one rushes straight through, and all three thunder, as if with rage and triumph.  They heap the chasm with a"]]]
