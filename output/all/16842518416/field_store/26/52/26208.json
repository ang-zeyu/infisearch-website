Good-bye, Anastasia.\"  \"Simon, why have you done--this?\"  The Vicar of Heriz Magna flung out his hands in a gesture of impotence. \"I dare confess now that which even to myself I have never dared confess. I suppose the truth of it is that I have loved you all my life.\"  \"I am sorry. I am not worth it, Simon.\"  \"No; you are immeasurably far from being worth it. But one does not justify these fancies by mathematics. Good-bye, Anastasia.\"   V  Holding the door ajar, the Vicar of Heriz Magna heard a horse's hoofs slap their leisurely way down the hillside. Presently the sound died and he turned back into the hall.  \"A brave woman, that! Oh, a trifling, shallow-hearted jilt, but a brave creature!  \"I had to lie to her. She would have stayed else. And perhaps it is true that, in reality, I have loved her all my life,--or in any event, have hankered after the pink-and-white flesh of her as any gentleman might. Pschutt! a pox on all lechery says the dying man,--since it is now necessary to put that strapping yellow-haired trollop out of your mind, Simon Orts--yes, after all these years, to put her quite out of your mind. Faith, she might wheedle me now to her heart's content, and my pulse would never budge; for I must devote what trivial time there is to hoping they will kill me quickly. He was their god, that man!\"  Simon Orts went toward the dead body, looking down into the distorted face. \"And I, too, loved him. Yes, such as he was, he was the only friend I had. And I think he liked me,\" Simon Orts said aloud, with a touch of shy pride. \"Yes, and you trusted me, didn't you, Vincent? Wait for me, then, my Lord,--I shall not be long. And now I'll serve you faithfully. I had to play the man's part, you know,--you mustn't grudge old Simon his one hour of manhood. You wouldn't, I think. And in any event, I shall be with you presently, and you can cuff me for it if you like--just as you used to do.\"  He covered the dead face with his handkerchief, but in the instant he drew it away. \"No, not this coarse cambric. You were too much of a fop, Vincent. I will use yours--the finest linen, my Lord. You see old Simon knows your tastes.\"  He drew himself erect exultantly.  \"They will come at dawn to kill me; but I have had my hour. God, the man I might have been! And now--well, perhaps He would not be offended if I said a bit of a prayer for Vincent.\"  So the Vicar of Heriz Magna knelt beside the flesh that had been Lord Rokesle, and there they found him in the morning.     II  LOVE AT MARTINMAS _As Played at Tunbridge Wells, April 1, 1750_      \"_He to love an altar built   Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.   There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves,   And all the trophies of his former loves;   With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,   And breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire;   Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes   Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize._\"   DRAMATIS PERSONÆ  MR. ERWYN, a gentleman of the town, ceremonious and a     coxcomb, but a man of honor. LADY ALLONBY, a woman of fashion, and widow to     Lord Stephen Allonby. MISS ALLONBY, daughter to Lord Stephen by a former     marriage, of a considerable fortune in her own hands. FOOTMEN to Lady Allonby; and in the Proem FRANCIS     ORTS, commonly know as FRANCIS VANBINGHAM, a     dissolute play-actor.   SCENE  A drawing-room In Lady Allonby's villa at Tunbridge Wells.   LOVE AT MARTINMAS   _PROEM:--To be Filed for Reference Hereafter_  Lady Allonby followed in all respects the Vicar's instructions; and midnight found her upon the pier of Bishops Onslow, Colonel Denstroude's big and dilapidated country-residence. Frank Orts had assisted her from the rowboat without speaking; indeed, he had uttered scarcely a word, save to issue some necessary direction, since the woman first came to him at the Vicarage with her news of the night's events. Now he composedly stepped back into the boat.  \"You've only to go forward,\" said Frank Orts. \"I regret that for my own part I'm no longer an acceptable visitor here, since the Colonel and I fought last summer over one Molly Yates. Nay, I beseech you, put up your purse, my Lady.\"  \"Then I can but render you my heartfelt thanks,\" replied Lady Allonby, \"and incessantly remember you in daily prayers for the two gallant men who have this night saved a woman from great misery. Yet there is that in your voice which is curiously familiar, Mr. Orts, and I think that somewhere you and I have met before this.\"  \"Ay,\" he responded, \"you have squandered many a shilling on me here in England, where Francis Vanringham bellows and makes faces with the rest of the Globe Company. On Usk, you understand, I'm still Frank Orts, just as I was christened; but elsewhere the name of Vanringham was long ago esteemed more apt to embellish and adorn the bill of a heroic play. Ay, you've been pleased to applaud my grimaces behind the footlights, more than once; your mother-in-law, indeed, the revered Marchioness-Dowager of Falmouth, is among my staunchest patrons.\"  \"Heavens! then we shall all again see one another at Tunbridge!\" said Lady Allonby, who was recovering her spirits; \"and I shall have a Heaven-sent opportunity, to confirm my protestations that I am not ungrateful. Mr. Vanringham, I explicitly command you to open in _The Orphan_, since: as Castalio in that piece you are the most elegant and moving thing in the universal world.\" [Footnote: This was the opinion of others as well. Thorsby (_Roscius Anglicanus_) says, \"Mr. Vanringham was good in tragedy, as well as in comedy, especially as Castalio in Otway's _Orphan_, and the more famous Garrick came, in that part, far short of him.\" Vanringham was also noted for his Valentine in _Love for Love_ and for his Beaugard in _The Soldier's Fortune_.]  \"Your command shall be obeyed,\" said the actor. \"And meantime, my Lady, I bid you an _au revoir_, with many millions of regrets for the inconveniences to which you've been subjected this evening, Oho, we are lamentably rustic hereabout.\"  And afterward as he rowed through the dark the man gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.  \"I was too abrupt with her. But it vexes me to have Brother Simon butchered like this.... These natural instincts are damnably inconvenient,--and expensive, at times, Mr. Vanringham,--beside being ruinous to one's sense of humor, Mr. Vanringham. Why, to think that she alone should go scot-free! and of her ordering a stage-box within the hour of two men's destruction on her account! Upon reflection, I admire the woman to the very tips of my toes. Eh, well! I trust to have need of her gratitude before the month is up.\"   I  Since Colonel Denstroude proved a profane and dissolute and helpful person, Lady Allonby was shortly re-established in her villa at Tunbridge Wells, on the Sussex side, where she had resolved to find a breathing-space prior to the full season in London. And thereupon she put all thoughts of Usk quite out of her mind: it had been an unhappy business, but it was over. In the meanwhile her wardrobe needed replenishing now that spring was coming in; the company at the Wells was gay enough; and Lady Allonby had always sedulously avoided anything that was disagreeable.  Mr. Erwyn Lady Allonby was far from cataloguing under that head. Mr. George Erwyn had been for years a major-general, at the very least, in Fashion's army, and was concededly a connoisseur of all the elegancies.  Mr. Erwyn sighed as he ended his recital--half for pity of the misguided folk who had afforded Tunbridge its latest scandal, half for relief that, in spite of many difficulties, the story had been set forth in discreet language which veiled, without at all causing you to miss, the more unsavory details.  \"And so,\" said he, \"poor Harry is run through the lungs, and Mrs. Anstruther has recovered her shape and is to be allowed a separate maintenance.\"  \"'Tis shocking!\" said Lady Allonby.  \"'Tis incredible,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"to my mind, at least, that the bonds of matrimony should be slipped thus lightly. But the age is somewhat lax and the world now views with complaisance the mad antics of half-grown lads and wenches who trip toward the altar as carelessly as if the partnership were for a country-dance.\"  Lady Allonby stirred her tea and said nothing. Notoriously her marriage had been unhappy; and her two years of widowhood (dating from the unlamented seizure, brought on by an inherited tendency to apoplexy and French brandy, which carried off Lord Stephen Allonby of Prestonwoode) had to all appearance never tempered her distrust of the matrimonial state. Certain it was that she had refused many advantageous offers during this period, for her jointure was considerable, and, though in candid moments she confessed to thirty-three, her dearest friends could not question Lady Allonby's good looks. She was used to say that she would never re-marry, because she desired to devote herself to her step-daughter, but, as gossip had it at Tunbridge, she was soon to be deprived of this subterfuge; for Miss Allonby had reached her twentieth year, and was nowadays rarely seen in public save in the company of Mr. Erwyn, who, it was generally conceded, stood high in the girl's favor and was desirous of rounding off his career as a leader of fashion with the approved comoedic _dénouement_ of marriage with a young heiress.  For these reasons Lady Allonby heard with interest his feeling allusion to the laxity of the age, and through a moment pondered thereon, for it seemed now tolerably apparent that Mr. Erwyn had lingered, after the departure of her other guests, in order to make a disclosure which Tunbridge had for many months expected.  \"I had not thought,\" said she, at length, \"that you, of all men, would ever cast a serious eye toward marriage. Indeed, Mr. Erwyn, you have loved women so long that I must dispute your ability to love a woman--and your amours have been a byword these twenty years.\"  \"Dear lady,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8715"],["title","Gallantry: Dizain des Fetes Galantes (#8)"],["body",". Erwyn, \"surely you would not confound amour with love? Believe me, the translation is inadequate. Amour is but the summer wave that lifts and glitters and laughs in the sunlight, and within the instant disappears; but love is the unfathomed eternal sea itself. Or--to shift the metaphor--Amour is a general under whom youth must serve: Curiosity and Lustiness are his recruiting officers, and it is well to fight under his colors, for it is against Ennui that he marshals his forces. 'Tis a resplendent conflict, and young blood cannot but stir and exult as paradoxes, marching and countermarching at the command of their gay generalissimo, make way for one another in iridescent squadrons, while through the steady musketry of epigram one hears the clash of contending repartees, or the cry of a wailing sonnet. But this lord of laughter may be served by the young alone; and by and by each veteran--scarred, it may be, but not maimed, dear lady--is well content to relinquish the glory and adventure of such colorful campaigns for some quiet inglenook, where, with love to make a third, he prattles of past days and deeds with one that goes hand in hand with him toward the tomb.\"  Lady Allonby accorded this conceit the tribute of a sigh; then glanced, in the direction of four impassive footmen to make sure they were out of earshot.  \"And so--?\" said she.  \"Split me!\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I thought you had noted it long ago.\"  \"Indeed,\" she observed, reflectively, \"I suppose it is quite time.\"  \"I am not,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"in the heyday of my youth, I grant you; but I am not for that reason necessarily unmoved by the attractions of an advantageous person, a fine sensibility and all the graces.\"  He sipped his tea with an air of resentment; and Lady Allonby, in view of the disparity of age which existed between Mr. Erwyn and her step-daughter, had cause to feel that she had blundered into _gaucherie_; and to await with contrition the proposal for her step-daughter's hand that the man was (at last) about to broach to her, as the head of the family.  \"Who is she?\" said Lady Allonby, all friendly interest.  \"An angel,\" said Mr. Erwyn, fencing.  \"Beware,\" Lady Allonby exhorted, \"lest she prove a recording angel; a wife who takes too deep an interest in your movements will scarcely suit you.\"  \"Oh, I am assured,\" said Mr. Erwyn, smiling, \"that on Saturdays she will allow me the customary half-holiday.\"  Lady Allonby, rebuffed, sought consolation among the conserves.  \"Yet, as postscript,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"I do not desire a wife who will take her morning chocolate with me and sup with Heaven knows whom. I have seen, too much of _mariage à la mode_, and I come to her, if not with the transports of an Amadis, at least with an entire affection and respect.\"  \"Then,\" said Lady Allonby, \"you love this woman?\"  \"Very tenderly,\" said Mr. Erwyn; \"and, indeed, I would, for her sake, that the errors of my past life were not so numerous, nor the frailty of my aspiring resolutions rendered apparent--ah, so many times!--to a gaping and censorious world. For, as you are aware, I cannot offer her an untried heart; 'tis somewhat worn by many barterings. But I know that this heart beats with accentuation in her presence; and when I come to her some day and clasp her in my arms, as I aspire to do, I trust that her lips may not turn away from mine and that she may be more glad because I am so near and that her stainless heart may sound an echoing chime. For, with a great and troubled adoration, I love her as I have loved no other woman; and this much, I submit, you cannot doubt.\"  \"I?\" said Lady Allonby, with extreme innocence. \"La, how should I know?\"  \"Unless you are blind,\" Mr. Erwyn observed--\"and I apprehend those spacious shining eyes to be more keen than the tongue of a dowager,--you must have seen of late that I have presumed to hope--to think--that she whom I love so tenderly might deign to be the affectionate, the condescending friend who would assist me to retrieve the indiscretions of my youth--\"  The confusion of his utterance, his approach to positive agitation as he waved his teaspoon, moved Lady Allonby. \"It is true,\" she said, \"that I have not been wholly blind--\"  \"Anastasia,\" said Mr. Erwyn, with yet more feeling, \"is not our friendship of an age to justify sincerity?\"  \"Oh, bless me, you toad! but let us not talk of things that happened under the Tudors. Well, I have not been unreasonably blind,--and I do not object,--and I do not believe that Dorothy will prove obdurate.\"  \"You render me the happiest of men,\" Mr. Erwyn stated, rapturously. \"You have, then, already discussed this matter with Miss Allonby?\"  \"Not precisely,\" said she, laughing; \"since I had thought it apparent to the most timid lover that the first announcement came with best grace from him.\"  \"O' my conscience, then, I shall be a veritable Demosthenes,\" said Mr. Erwyn, laughing likewise; \"and in common decency she will consent.\"  \"Your conceit.\" said Lady Allonby, \"is appalling.\"  \"'Tis beyond conception,\" Mr. Erwyn admitted; \"and I propose to try marriage as a remedy. I have heard that nothing so takes down a man.\"  \"Impertinent!\" cried Lady Allonby; \"now of whatever can the creature be talking!\"  \"I mean that, as your widowship well knows, marrying puts a man in his proper place. And that the outcome is salutary for proud, puffed-up fellows I would be the last to dispute. Indeed, I incline to dispute nothing, for I find that perfect felicity is more potent than wine. I am now all pastoral raptures, and were it not for the footmen there, I do not know to what lengths I might go.\"  \"In that event,\" Lady Allonby decided, \"I shall fetch Dorothy, that the crown may be set upon your well-being. And previously I will dismiss the footmen.\" She did so with a sign toward those lordly beings.  \"Believe me,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"'tis what I have long wished for. And when Miss Allonby honors me with her attention I shall, since my life's happiness depends upon the issue, plead with all the eloquence of a starveling barrister, big with the import of his first case. May I, indeed, rest assured that any triumph over her possible objections may be viewed with not unfavorable eyes?\"  \"O sir,\" said Lady Allonby, \"believe me, there is nothing I more earnestly desire than that you may obtain all which is necessary for your welfare. I will fetch Dorothy.\"  The largest footman but one removed Mr. Erwyn's cup.   II  Mr. Erwyn, left alone, smiled at his own reflection in the mirror; rearranged his ruffles with a deft and shapely hand; consulted his watch; made sure that the padding which enhanced the calves of his most notable legs was all as it should be; seated himself and hummed a merry air, in meditative wise; and was in such posture when the crimson hangings that shielded the hall-door quivered and broke into tumultuous waves and yielded up Miss Dorothy Allonby.  Being an heiress, Miss Allonby was by an ancient custom brevetted a great beauty; and it is equitable to add that the sourest misogynist could hardly have refused, pointblank, to countersign the commission. They said of Dorothy Allonby that her eyes were as large as her bank account, and nearly as formidable as her tongue; and it is undeniable that on provocation there was in her speech a tang of acidity, such (let us say) as renders a salad none the less palatable. In a word, Miss Allonby pitied the limitations of masculine humanity more readily than its amorous pangs, and cuddled her women friends as she did kittens, with a wary and candid apprehension of their power to scratch; and decision was her key-note; continually she knew to the quarter-width of a cobweb what she wanted, and invariably she got it.  Such was the person who, with a habitual emphasis which dowagers found hoydenish and all young men adorable, demanded without prelude:  \"Heavens! What can it be, Mr. Erwyn, that has cast Mother into this unprecedented state of excitement?\"  \"What, indeed?\" said he, and bowed above her proffered hand.  \"For like a hurricane, she burst into my room and cried, 'Mr. Erwyn has something of importance to declare to you--why did you put on that gown?--bless you, my child--' all in one eager breath; then kissed me, and powdered my nose, and despatched me to you without any explanation. And why?\" said Miss Allonby.  \"Why, indeed?\" said Mr. Erwyn.  \"It is very annoying,\" said she, decisively.  \"Sending you to me?\" said Mr. Erwyn, a magnitude of reproach in his voice.  \"That,\" said Miss Allonby, \"I can pardon--and easily. But I dislike all mysteries, and being termed a child, and being--\"  \"Yes?\" said Mr. Erwyn.  \"--and being powdered on the nose,\" said Miss Allonby, with firmness. She went to the mirror, and, standing on the tips of her toes, peered anxiously into its depths. She rubbed her nose, as if in disapproval, and frowned, perhaps involuntarily pursing up her lips,--which Mr. Erwyn intently regarded, and then wandered to the extreme end of the apartment, where he evinced a sudden interest in bric-à-brac.  \"Is there any powder on my nose?\" said Miss Allonby.  \"I fail to perceive any,\" said Mr. Erwyn.  \"Come closer,\" said she.  \"I dare not,\" said he.  Miss Allonby wheeled about. \"Fie!\" she cried; \"one who has served against the French, [Footnote: This was not absolutely so. Mr. Erwyn had, however, in an outburst of patriotism, embarked, as a sort of cabin passenger, with his friend Sir John Morris, and possessed in consequence some claim to share such honor as was won by the glorious fiasco of Dungeness.] and afraid of powder!\"  \"It is not the powder that I fear.\"  \"What, then?\" said she, in sinking to the divan beside the disordered tea-table.  \"There are two of them,\" said Mr. Erwyn, \"and they are so red--\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Miss Allonby, with heightened color.  \"'Tis best to avoid temptation,\" said Mr. Erwyn, virtuously.  \"Undoubtedly,\" she assented, \"it is best to avoid having your ears boxed.\"  Mr. Erwyn sighed as if in"]]]
