Still, however, she could not help thinking and talking about the box.  “At least,” said she, “you can tell me how it came here.”  “It was left at the door,” replied Epimetheus, “just before you came, by a person who looked very smiling and intelligent, and who could hardly forbear laughing as he put it down.  He was dressed in an-odd kind of a cloak, and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of feathers, so that it looked almost as if it had wings.”  “What sort of a staff had he?” asked Pandora.  “O, the most curious staff you ever saw!”  cried Epimetheus.  “It was like two serpents twisting around a stick, and was carved so naturally that I, at first, bought the serpents were alive.”  “I know him,” said Pandora, thoughtfully.  “Nobody else has such a staff.  It was Quicksilver; and he brought one hither, as well as the box.  No doubt he intended it for me; and, most probably, it contains pretty dresses for me to wear, or toys for you and me to play with, or something very nice for us both to eat!”  “Perhaps so,” answered Epimetheus, turning away.  “But until Quicksilver comes back and tells us so, we have neither of us any right to lift the lid of the box.”  “What a dull boy he is!”  muttered Pandora, as Epimetheus left the cottage.  “I do wish he had a little more enterprise!”  For the first time since her arrival, Epimetheus had gone out without asking Pandora to accompany him.  He went to gather figs and grapes by himself, or to seek whatever amusement he could find, in other society than his little playfellow’s.  He was tired to death of hearing about the box, and heartily wished that Quicksilver, or whatever was the messenger’s name, had left it at some other child’s door, where Pandora would never have set eyes on it.  So perseveringly as she did babble about this one thing!  The box, the box, and nothing but the box!  It seemed as if the box were bewitched, and as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it, without Pandora’s continually stumbling over it, and making Epimetheus stumble over it likewise, and bruising all four of their shins.  Well, it was really hard that poor Epimetheus should have a box in his ears from morning till night; especially as the little people of the earth were so unaccustomed to vexations, in those happy days, that they knew not how to deal with them.  Thus, a small vexation made as much disturbance, then, as a far bigger one would, in our own times.  After Epimetheus was gone, Pandora stood gazing at the box.  She had called it ugly, above a hundred times; but, in spite of all that she had said against it, it was positively a very handsome article of furniture, and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which it should be placed.  It was made of a beautiful kind of wood, with dark and rich veins spreading over its surface, which was so highly polished that little Pandora could see her face in it.  As the child had no other looking-glass, it is odd that she did not value the box, merely on this account.  The edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful skill. Around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women, and the prettiest children ever seen, reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage; and these various objects were so exquisitely represented, and were wrought together in such harmony, that flowers, foliage, and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty.  But here and there, peeping forth from behind the carved foliage, Pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely, or something or other that was disagreeable, and which stole the beauty out of all the rest.  Nevertheless, on looking more closely, and touching the spot with her finger, she could discover nothing of the kind.  Some face, that was really beautiful, had been made to look ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it.  The most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief, in the centre of the lid.  There was nothing else, save the dark, smooth richness of the polished wood, and this one face in the centre, with a garland of flowers about its brow.  Pandora had looked at this face a great many times, and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked, or be grave when it chose, the same as any living mouth.  The features, indeed, all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression, which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips, and utter itself in words.  Had the mouth spoken, it would probably have been something like this:  “Do not be afraid, Pandora!  What harm can there be in opening the box? Never mind that poor, simple Epimetheus!  You are wiser than he, and have ten times as much spirit.  Open the box, and see if you do not find something very pretty!”  The box, I had almost forgotten to say, was fastened; not by a lock, nor by any other such contrivance, but by a very intricate knot of gold cord.  There appeared to be no end to this knot, and no beginning. Never was a knot so cunningly twisted, nor with so many ins and outs, which roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle them.  And yet, by the very difficulty that there was in it, Pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot, and just see how it was made.  Two or three times, already, she had stooped over the box, and taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger, but without positively trying to undo it.  “I really believe,” said she to herself, “that I begin to see how it was done.  Nay, perhaps I could tie it up again, after undoing it.  There would be no harm in that, surely.  Even Epimetheus would not blame me for that.  I need not open the box, and should not, of course, without the foolish boy’s consent, even if the knot were untied.”  It might have been better for Pandora if she had had a little work to do, or anything to employ her mind upon, so as not to be so constantly thinking of this one subject.  But children led so easy a life, before any Troubles came into the world, that they had really a great deal too much leisure.  They could not be forever playing at hide-and-seek among the flower-shrubs, or at blind-man’s-buff with garlands over their eyes, or at whatever other games had been found out, while Mother Earth was in her babyhood.  When life is all sport, toil is the real play.  There was absolutely nothing to do.  A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage, I suppose, and the gathering of fresh flowers (which were only too abundant everywhere), and arranging them in vases,--and poor little Pandora’s day’s work was over.  And then, for the rest of the day, there was the box!  After all, I am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way.  It supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of, and to talk about, whenever she had anybody to listen!  When she was in good humor, she could admire the bright polish of its sides, and the rich border of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it.  Or, if she chanced to be ill-tempered, she could give it a push, or kick it with her naughty little foot.  And many a kick did the box--(but it was a mischievous box, as we shall see, and deserved all it got)--many a kick did it receive.  But, certain it is, if it had not been for the box, our active-minded little Pandora would not have known half so well how to spend her time as she now did.  For it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside.  What could it be, indeed?  Just imagine, my little hearers, how busy your wits would be, if there were a great box in the house, which, as you might have reason to suppose, contained something new and pretty for your Christmas or New-Year’s gifts.  Do you think that you should be less curious than Pandora?  If you were left alone with the box, might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid?  But you would not do it. O, fie!  No, no!  Only, if you thought there were toys in it, it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep!  I know not whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had yet begun to be made, probably, in those days, when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it.  But Pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls, here around me, would have felt.  And, possibly, a little more so; but of that I am not quite so certain.  On this particular day, however, which we have so long been talking about, her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was, that, at last, she approached the box.  She was more than half determined to open it, if she could.  Ah, naughty Pandora!  First, however, she tried to lift it.  It was heavy; quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child, like Pandora.  She raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor, and let it fall again, with a pretty loud thump.  A moment afterwards, she almost fancied that she heard something stir, inside of the box.  She applied her ear as closely as possible, and listened. Positively, there did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur, within!  Or was it merely the singing in Pandora’s ears? Or could it be the beating of her heart?  The child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no.  But, at all events, her curiosity was stronger than ever.  As she drew back her head, her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord.  “It must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot,” said Pandora to herself.  “But I think I could untie it, nevertheless.  I am resolved, at least, to find the two ends of the cord.”  So she took the golden knot in her fingers, and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could.  Almost without intending it, or quite knowing what she was about, she was soon busily "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9256"],["title","The Paradise of Children (#2)"],["body","in attempting to undo it.  Meanwhile, the bright sunshine came through the open window; as did likewise the merry voices of the children, playing at a distance, and perhaps the voice of Epimetheus among then.  Pandora stopped to listen.  What a beautiful day it was!  Would it not be wiser, if she were to let the troublesome knot alone, and think no more about the box, but run and join her little playfellows, and be happy?  All this time, however, her fingers were half unconsciously busy with the knot; and happening to glance at the flower-wreathed face on the lid of the enchanted box, she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning at her.  “That face looks very mischievous,” thought Pandora.  “I wonder whether it smiles because I am doing wrong!  I have the greatest mind in the world to run away!”  But just then, by the merest accident, she gave the knot a kind of a twist, which produced a wonderful result.  The gold cord untwined itself, as if by magic, and left the box without a fastening.  “This is the strangest thing I ever knew!” said Pandora.  “What will Epimetheus say?  And how can I possibly tie it up again?”  She made one or two attempts to restore the knot, but soon found it quite beyond her skill.  It had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could not in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another; and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot, it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind.  Nothing was to be done, therefore, but to let the box remain as it was, until Epimetheus should come in.  “But,” said Pandora, “when he finds the knot untied, he will know that I have done it.  How shall I make him believe that I have not looked into the box?”  And then the thought came into her naughty little heart, that, since she would be suspected of having looked into the box, she might just as well do so, at once.  O, very naughty and very foolish Pandora!  You should have thought only of doing what was right, and of leaving undone what was wrong, and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus would have said or believed.  And so perhaps she might, if the enchanted face on the lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her, and if she had not seemed to hear, more distinctly than before, the murmur of small voices within.  She could not tell whether it was fancy or no; but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her ear,--or else it was her curiosity that whispered,  “Let us out, dear Pandora,--pray let us out!  We will be such nice pretty playfellows for you!  Only let us out!”  “What can it be?” thought Pandora.  “Is there something alive in the box?  Well!--yes!--I am resolved to take just one peep!  Only one peep; and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever!  There cannot possibly be any harm in just one little peep!”  But it is now time for us to see what Epimetheus was doing.  This was the first time, since his little playmate had come to dwell with him, that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake.  But nothing went right; nor was he nearly so happy as on other days.  He could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig (if Epimetheus had a fault, it was a little too much fondness for figs); or, if ripe at all, they were over-ripe, and so sweet as to be cloying. There was no mirth in his heart, such as usually made his voice gush out, of its own accord, and swell the merriment of his companions.  In short, he grew so uneasy and discontented, that the other children could not imagine what was the matter with Epimetheus.  Neither did he himself know what ailed him, any better than they did.  For you must recollect, that at the time we are speaking of, it was everybody’s nature, and constant habit, to be happy.  The world had not yet learned to be otherwise.  Not a single soul or body, since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth, had ever been sick, or out of sorts.  At length, discovering that, somehow or other, he put a stop to all the play, Epimetheus judged it best to go back to Pandora, who was in a humor better suited to his own.  But, with a hope of giving her pleasure, he gathered some flowers, and made them into a wreath, which he meant to put upon her head.  The flowers were very lovely,--roses, and lilies, and orange-blossoms, and a great many more, which left a trail of fragrance behind, as Epimetheus carried them along; and the wreath was put together with as much skill as could reasonably be expected of a boy.  The fingers of little girls, it has always appeared to me, are the fittest to twine flower-wreaths; but boys could do it, in those days, rather better than they can now.  And here I must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering in the sky, for some time past, although it had not yet overspread the sun. But, just as Epimetheus reached the cottage door, this cloud began to intercept the sunshine, and thus to make a sudden and sad obscurity.  He entered softly; for he meant, if possible, to steal behind Pandora, and fling the wreath of flowers over her head, before she should be aware of his approach.  But, as it happened, there was no need of his treading so very lightly.  He might have trod as heavily as he pleased,--as heavily as a grown man,--as heavily, I was going to say, as an elephant,--without much probability of Pandora’s hearing his footsteps. She was too intent upon her purpose.  At the moment of his entering the cottage, the naughty child had put her hand to the lid, and was on the point of opening the mysterious box.  Epimetheus beheld her.  If he had cried out, Pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand, and the fatal mystery of the box might never have been known.  But Epimetheus himself, although he said very little about it, had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside.  Perceiving that Pandora was resolved to find out the secret, he determined that his playfellow should not be the only wise person in the cottage.  And if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box, he meant to take half of it to himself.  Thus, after all his sage speeches to Pandora about restraining her curiosity, Epimetheus turned out to be quite as foolish, and nearly as much in fault, as she.  So, whenever we blame Pandora for what happened, we must not forget to shake our heads at Epimetheus likewise.  As Pandora raised the lid, the cottage grew very dark and dismal; for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun, and seemed to have buried it alive.  There had, for a little while past, been a low growling and muttering, which all at once broke into a heavy peal of thunder.  But Pandora, heeding nothing of all this, lifted the lid nearly upright, and looked inside.  It seemed as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures brushed past her, taking flight out of the box, while, at the same instant, she heard the voice of Epimetheus, with a lamentable tone, as if he were in pain.  “O, I am stung!” cried he.  “I am stung!  Naughty Pandora!  why have you opened this wicked box?”  Pandora let fall the lid, and, starting up, looked about her, to see what had befallen Epimetheus.  The thundercloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it.  But she heard a disagreeable buzzing, as if a great many huge flies, or gigantic mosquitoes, or those insects which we call dorbugs and pinching-dogs, were darting about.  And, as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light, she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes, with bats’ wings, looking abominably spiteful, and armed with terribly long stings in their tails.  It was one of these that had stung Epimetheus.  Nor was it a great while before Pandora herself began to scream, in no less pain and affright than her playfellow, and making a vast deal more hubbub about it.  An odious little monster had settled on her forehead, and would have stung her I know not how deeply, if Epimetheus had not run and brushed it away.  Now, if you wish to know what these ugly things might be, which had made their escape out of the box, I must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly Troubles.  There were evil Passions; there were a great many species of Cares; there were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there were Diseases, in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes; there were more kinds of Naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about.  In short, everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box, and given to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept safely, in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them.  Had they been faithful to their trust, all would have gone well.  No grown person would ever have been sad, nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear, from that hour until this moment.  But--and you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole world--by Pandora’s lifting the lid of that miserable box, and by the fault of Epimetheus, too, in not preventing her, these Troubles have obtained a foothold among us, and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry.  For it was impossible, as you will easily guess, that the two children should keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage.  On the contrary, the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows, in hopes of getting rid of them; and, sure enough, away flew the winged Troubles all abroad, and so pestered and tormented the small people, everywhere about, that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterwards.  And, what was very singular, all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth, not one of which had hitherto faded, now began to droop and shed their leaves, after a day or two.  The children, moreover, who before seemed immortal in their childhood, now grew older, day by day, and came soon to be youths and maidens, and men and"]]]
