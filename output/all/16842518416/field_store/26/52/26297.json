Then they took their places in the canoe again and paddled on for nearly a mile.   \"See, Harold!\" Nelly exclaimed as she got a glimpse through the boughs into the lake, \"there is another canoe. They must have got the Braithwaite boat. We passed their place coming here, you know. I wonder what has happened there.\"  \"What do you think is best to do, Nelly?\" Harold asked. \"Your opinion is just as good as mine about it. Shall we leave our canoe behind, land, and take to the woods, or shall we stop quietly in the canoe in shelter here, or shall we take to the lake and trust to our speed to get away? in which case, you know, if they should come up I could pick them off with my gun before they got within reach.  \"I don't think that would do,\" the girl said, shaking her head. \"You shoot very well, but it is not an easy thing to hit a moving object if you are not accustomed to it, and they paddle so fast that if you miss them once they would be close alongside--at any rate we should be within reach of their guns--before you could load again. They would be sure to catch us, for although we might paddle nearly as fast for a time, they would certainly tire us out. Then, as to waiting here in the canoe, if they came along on foot looking for us we should be in their power. It is dreadful to think of taking to the woods with Indians all about, but I really think that would be our safest plan.\"  \"I think so too, Nelly, if we can manage to do it without leaving a track. We must not go much further, for the trees are getting thinner ahead and we should be seen by the canoes.\"  Fifty yards further Harold stopped paddling.  \"Here is just the place, Nelly.\"  At this point a little stream of three or four feet wide emerged into the lake; Harold directed the boat's head toward it. The water in the stream was but a few inches deep.  \"Now, Nelly,\" he said, \"we must step out into the water and walk up it as far as we can go--it will puzzle even the sharpest redskin to find our track then.\"  They stepped into the water, Harold taking the head-rope of the canoe and towing the light boat--which, when empty, did not draw more than two inches of water--behind him. He directed Nelly to be most careful as she walked not to touch any of the bushes, which at times nearly met across the stream.  \"A broken twig or withered leaf would be quite enough to tell the Indians that we came along this way,\" he said. \"Where the bushes are thick you must manage to crawl under them. Never mind about getting wet--you will soon dry again.\"  Slowly and cautiously they made their way up the stream for nearly a mile. It had for some distance been narrowing rapidly, being only fed by little rills from the surrounding swamp land. Harold had so far looked in vain for some spot where they could land without leaving marks of their feet. Presently they came to a place where a great tree had fallen across the stream.  \"This will do, Nelly,\" Harold said. \"Now, above all things you must be careful not to break off any of the moss or bark. You had better take your shoes off; then I will lift you on to the trunk and you can walk along it without leaving a mark.\"  It was hard work for Nelly to take off her drenched boots, but she managed at last. Harold lifted her on to the trunk and said:  \"Walk along as far as you can and get down as lightly as possible on to a firm piece of ground. It rises rapidly here and is, I expect, a dry soil where the upper end of the tree lies.\"  \"How are you going to get out, Harold?\"  \"I can swing myself up by that projecting root.\"  Before proceeding to do so Harold raised one end of the canoe and placed it on the trunk of the tree; then, having previously taken off his shoes, he swung himself on to the trunk; hauling up the light bark canoe and taking especial pains that it did not grate upon the trunk, he placed it on his head and followed Nelly along the tree. He found, as he had expected, that the ground upon which the upper end lay was firm and dry. He stepped down with great care, and was pleased to see, as he walked forward, that no trace of a footmark was left.  \"Be careful, Nelly,\" he exclaimed when he joined her, \"not to tread on a stick or disturb a fallen leaf with your feet, and above all to avoid breaking the smallest twig as you pass. Choose the most open ground, as that is the hardest.\"  In about a hundred yards they came upon a large clump of bushes.  \"Now, Nelly, raise those lower boughs as gently and as carefully as you can. I will push the canoe under. I don't think the sharpest Indian will be able to take up our track now.\"  Very carefully the canoe was stowed away, and when the boughs were allowed to fall in their natural position it was completely hidden from sight to every passer-by. Harold took up the fish, Nelly had filled her apron with the berries, and carrying their shoes--for they agreed that it would be safer not to put them on--they started on their journey through the deep forest.     CHAPTER III.   THE REDSKIN ATTACK.  Mr. Welch was with the men, two or three hundred yards away from the house, when the Indians suddenly sprang out and opened fire. One of the men fell beside him; the farmer stooped to lift him, but saw that he was shot through the head. Then he ran with full speed toward the house, shouting to the hands to make straight for the gate, disregarding the cattle. Several of these, however, alarmed at the sudden outburst of fire and the yells of the Indians, made of their own accord for the stables as their master rushed up at full speed. The Indians were but fifty or sixty yards behind when Mr. Welch reached his gate. They had all emptied their pieces, and after the first volley no shots had been fired save one by the watchman on the lookout. Then came the crack of Pearson's rifle just as Mr. Welch shut the gate and laid the bar in its place. Several spare guns had been placed in the upper chambers, and three reports rang out together, for Mrs. Welch had run upstairs at the first alarm to take her part in the defense.  In another minute the whole party, now six in all, were gathered in the upper room.  \"Where are Nelly and Harold?\" Mr. Welch exclaimed. \"I saw the canoe close to the shore just before the Indians opened fire,\" the watchman answered.  \"You must have been asleep,\" Pearson said savagely. \"Where were your eyes to let them redskins crawl up through the corn without seeing 'em? With such a crowd of 'em the corn must have been a-waving as if it was blowing a gale. You ought to have a bullet in yer ugly carkidge, instead of its being in yer mate's out there.\"  While this conversation was going on no one had been idle. Each took up his station at a loop-hole, and several shots were fired whenever the movement of a blade of corn showed the lurking place of an Indian.  The instant the gate had been closed War Eagle had called his men back to shelter, for he saw that all chance of a surprise was now over, and it was contrary to all redskin strategy to remain for one moment unnecessarily exposed to the rifles of the whites. The farmer and his wife had rushed at once up into the lookout as the Indians drew off and, to their joy, saw the canoe darting away from shore.  \"They are safe for the present, thank God!\" Mr. Welch said. \"It is providential indeed that they had not come a little further from the shore when the redskins broke out. Nothing could have saved them, had they fairly started for the house.\"  \"What will they do, William?\" asked his wife anxiously.  \"I cannot tell you, my dear. I do not know what I should do myself under the circumstances. However, the boy has got a cool head on his shoulders, and you need not be anxious for the present. Now let us join the others. Our first duty is to take our share in the defense of the house. The young ones are in the hands of God. We can do nothing for them.\"  \"Well?\" Pearson asked, looking round from his loop-hole as the farmer and his wife descended into the room, which was a low garret extending over the whole of the house. \"Do you see the canoe?\"  \"Yes, it has got safely away,\" William Welch said; \"but what the lad will do now is more than I can say.\"  Pearson placed his rifle against the wall. \"Now keep your eyes skinned,\" he said to the three farm hands.  \"One of yer's done mischief enough this morning already, and you'll get your har raised, as sure as you're born, unless you look out sharp. Now,\" he went on, turning to the Welches, \"let us go down and talk this matter over. The Injuns may keep on firing, but I don't think they'll show in the open again as long as it's light enough for us to draw bead on 'em. Yes,\" he went on, as he looked through a loop-hole in the lower story over the lake, \"there they are, just out of range.\"  \"What do you think they will do?\" Mrs. Welch asked.  The hunter was silent for a minute.  \"It aint a easy thing to say what they ought to do, much less what they will do; it aint a good outlook anyway, and I don't know what I should do myself. The whole of the woods on this side of the lake are full of the darned red critters. There's a hundred eyes on that canoe now, and, go where they will, they'll be watched.\"  \"But why should they not cross the lake and land on the other side?\" Mr. Welch said.  \"If you and I were in that canoe,\" the hunter answered, \"that's about what we should do; but, not to say that it's a long row for 'em, they two young uns would never get across; the Injuns would have 'em before they had been gone an hour. There's my canoe lying under the bushes; she'd carry four, and would go three feet to their two.\"  \"I had forgotten about that,\" William Welch said, and then added, after a pause: \"The Indians may not find it.\"  \"You needn't hope that,\" the hunter answered; \"they have found it long before this. I don't want to put you out of heart; but I tell ye ye'll see them on the water before many"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8859"],["title","True to the Old Flag: A Tale of the American War of Independence (#6)"],["body","have passed.\"  \"Then they are lost,\" Mrs. Welch said, sinking down in her chair and bursting into tears.  \"They air in God's hands, ma'am,\" the hunter said, \"and it's no use trying to deceive you.\"  \"Would it be of any use,\" William Welch asked, after a pause, \"for me to offer the redskins that my wife and I will go out and put ourselves in their hands if they will let the canoe go off without pursuit?\"  \"Not it,\" the hunter replied decidedly. \"You would be throwing away your own lives without saving theirs, not to mention, although that doesn't matter a straw, the lives of the rest of us here. It will be as much as we can do, when they attack us in earnest, to hold this place with six guns, and with only four the chance would be worth nothing. But that's neither here nor there. You wouldn't save the young ones if you gave yourselves up. You can't trust the word of an Injun on the war-path, and if they went so far as not to kill 'em they would carry 'em off; and, after all, I aint sure as death aint better for 'em than to be brought up as Injuns. There,\" he said, stopping suddenly as a report of a musket sounded at some little distance off, \"the Injuns are trying their range against 'em. Let's go up to the lookout.\"  The little tower had a thick parapet of logs some three feet high, and, crouching behind this, they watched the canoe. \"He's coming nearer in shore, and the girl has got the paddle,\" Pearson muttered. \"What's he doing now?\" A puff of smoke was seen to rise near the border of the lake; then came the sharp crack of Harold's rifle. They saw an Indian spring from the bushes and fall dead.  \"Well done, young un!\" Pearson exclaimed. \"I told yer he'd got his head screwed on the right way. He's keeping just out of range of their guns, and that piece of his can carry twice as far as theirs. I reckon he's thought of the canoe, and means to keep 'em from using it. I begins to think, Mr. Welch, that there's a chance for 'em yet. Now let's talk a little to these red devils in the corn.\"  For some little time Pearson and William Welch turned their attention to the Indians, while the mother sat with her eyes fixed upon the canoe.  \"He is coming closer again,\" she exclaimed presently.  \"He's watching the canoe, sure enough,\" Pearson said. Then came the volley along the bushes on the shore, and they saw an Indian rise to his feet.  \"That's just where she lies!\" Pearson exclaimed; \"he's getting into it. There! well done, young un.\"  The sudden disappearance of the Indian and the vengeful yell of the hidden foe told of the failure of the attempt.  \"I think they're safe, now, till nightfall. The Injuns won't care about putting themselves within range of that 'ere rifle again.\"  Gradually the fire of the Indians ceased, and the defenders were able to leave the loop-holes. Two of the men went down and fastened up the cattle, which were still standing loose in the yard inside the stockade; the other set to to prepare a meal, for Mrs. Welch could not take her eyes off the canoe.  The afternoon seemed of interminable length. Not a shot was fired. The men, after taking their dinner, were occupied in bringing some great tubs on to the upper story and filling them to the brim with water from the well. This story projected two feet beyond the one below it, having been so built in order that, in case of attack, the defenders might be able to fire down upon any foe who might cross the stockade and attack the house itself; the floor boards over the projecting portion were all removable. The men also brought a quantity of the newly cut corn to the top of the house, first drenching it with water.  The sun sank, and as dusk was coming on the anxious watchers saw the canoe paddle out far into the lake.  \"An old frontiersman couldn't do better,\" Pearson exclaimed. \"He's kept them out of the canoe as long as daylight lasted; now he has determined to paddle away and is making down the lake,\" he went on presently. \"It's a pity he turned so soon, as they can see the course he's taking.\"  They watched until it was completely dark; but, before the light quite faded, they saw another canoe put out from shore and start in the direction taken by the fugitives.  \"Will they catch them, do you think?\" Mrs. Welch asked.  \"No, ma'am,\" Pearson said confidently. \"The boy's got sense enough to have changed his course after it gets dark, though whether he'll make for shore or go out toward the other side is more than I can say. You see, they'll know that the Injuns are all along this side of the lake; but then, on the other hand, they'll be anxious about us and 'll want to keep close at hand. Besides, the lad knows nothing of the other side; there may be Injuns there, for aught he knows, and it's a skeary thing for a young un to take to the forest, especially with a gal in his charge. There aint no saying what he'll do. And now we've got to look after ourselves; don't let us think about 'em at present. The best thing as we can do for them, as well as for ourselves, is to hold this here place. If they live they'll come back to it sooner or later, and it 'll be better for 'em to find it standing, and you here to welcome 'em, than to get back to a heap of ruins and some dead bodies.\"  \"When will the redskins attack, do you think?\" the farmer asked.  \"We may expect 'em any time, now,\" the hunter answered. \"The Injuns' time of attack is generally just before dawn, but they know well enough they aint likely to ketch us asleep any time, and, as they know exactly what they have got to do they'll gain nothing by waiting. I wish we had a moon; if we had, we might keep 'em out of the stockade. But there--it's just as well it's dark, after all; for, if the moon was up, the young ones would have no chance of getting away.\"  The garrison now all took their places at the loop-holes, having first carried the wet fodder to the roof and spread it over the shingles. There was nothing to do now but to wait. The night was so dark that they could not see the outline of the stockade. Presently a little spark shot through the air, followed by a score of others. Mr. Welch had taken his post on the tower, and he saw the arrows whizzing through the air, many of them falling on the roof. The dry grass dipped in resin, which was tied round the arrow-heads, was instantly extinguished as the arrows fell upon the wet corn, and a yell arose from the Indians.  The farmer descended and told the others of the failure of the Indians' first attempt.  \"That 'ere dodge is a first-rate un,\" Pearson said. \"We're safe from fire, and that's the only thing we've got to be afeared on. You'll see 'em up here in a few minutes.\"  Everything was perfectly quiet. Once or twice the watchers thought that they could hear faint sounds, but could not distinguish their direction. After half an hour's anxious waiting a terrible yell was heard from below, and at the doors and windows of the lower rooms came the crashing blows of tomahawks.  The boards had already been removed from the flooring above, and the defenders opened a steady fire into the dark mass that they could faintly make out clustered round the windows and doors. At Pearson's suggestion the bullets had been removed from the guns and heavy charges of buckshot had been substituted for them, and yells of pain and surprise rose as they fired. A few shots were fired up from below, but a second discharge from the spare guns completed the effect from the first volley. The dark mass broke up and, in a few seconds, all was as quiet as before.  Two hours passed, and then slight sounds were heard. \"They've got the gate opened, I expect,\" Pearson said. \"Fire occasionally at that; if we don't hit 'em the flashes may show us what they're doing.\"  It was as he had expected. The first discharge was followed by a cry, and by the momentary light they saw a number of dark figures pouring in through the gate. Seeing that concealment was no longer possible, the Indians opened a heavy fire round the house; then came a crashing sound near the door.  \"Just as I thought,\" Pearson said. \"They're going to try to burn us out.\"  For some time the noise continued, as bundle after bundle of dried wood was thrown down by the door. The garrison were silent; for, as Pearson said, they could see nothing, and a stray bullet might enter at the loop-holes if they placed themselves there, and the flashes of the guns would serve as marks for the Indians.  Presently two or three faint lights were seen approaching.  \"Now,\" Pearson said, \"pick 'em off as they come up. You and I'll take the first man, Welch. You fire just to the right of the light, I will fire to the left; he may be carrying the brand in either hand.\"  They fired together, and the brand was seen to drop to the ground. The same thing happened as the other two sparks of light approached; then it was again quiet. Now a score of little lights flashed through the air.  \"They're going to light the pile with their flaming arrows,\" Pearson said. \"War Eagle is a good leader.\"  Three or four of the arrows fell on the pile of dry wood. A moment later the flames crept up and the smoke of burning wood rolled up into the room above. A yell of triumph burst from the Indians, but this changed into one of wrath as those above emptied the contents of one of the great tubs of water on to the pile of wood below them. The flames were instantly extinguished.  \"What will they do next?\" Mrs. Welch asked.  \"It's like enough,\" Pearson replied, \"that they'll give the job up altogether. They've got plenty of plunder and scalps at the settlements, and their attacking us here in such force looks as if the hull of 'em were on their way back to their villages. If they could have tuk our scalps easy they would have done it; but War Eagle aint likely to risk losing a lot of men when he aint sartin of winning, after all. He has done good work as it is, and has quite enough to boast about when he gets back. If he were to lose a heap of his braves here"]]]
