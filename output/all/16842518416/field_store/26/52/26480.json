I have helped a good many young men through adventures that looked difficult enough beforehand.  Perhaps you may have heard of me.  I have more names than one; but the name of Quicksilver suits me as well as any other.  Tell me what your trouble is, and we will talk the matter over, and see what can be done.”  The stranger’s words and manner put Perseus into quite a different mood from his former one.  He resolved to tell Quicksilver all his difficulties, since he could not easily be worse off than he already was, and, very possibly, his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end.  So he let the stranger know, in few words, precisely what the case was;--how that King Polydeetes wanted the head of Medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia, and how that he had undertaken to get it for him, but was afraid of being turned into stone.  “And that would be a great pity,” said Quicksilver, with his mischievous smile.  “You would make a very handsome marble statue, it is true, and it would be a considerable number of centuries before you crumbled away; but, on the whole, one would rather be a young man for a few years, than a stone image for a great many.”  “O, far rather!” exclaimed Perseus, with the tears again standing in his eyes.  “And, besides, what would my dear mother do, if her beloved son were turned into a stone?”  “Well, well; let us hope that the affair will not turn out so very badly,” replied Quicksilver, in an encouraging tone.  “I am the very person to help you, if anybody can.  My sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through the adventure, ugly as it now looks.”  “Your sister?” repeated Perseus.  “Yes, my sister,” said the stranger.  “She is very wise, I promise you; and as for myself, I generally have all my wits about me, such as they are.  If you show yourself bold and cautious, and follow our advice, you need not fear being a stone image yet awhile.  But, first of all, you must polish your shield, till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a mirror.”  This seemed to Perseus rather an odd beginning of the adventure; for he thought it of far more consequence that the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the Gorgon’s brazen claws, than that it should be bright enough to show him the reflection of his face.  However, concluding that Quicksilver knew better than himself, he immediately set to work, and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence and good-will, that it very quickly shone like the moon at harvest-time.  Quicksilver looked at it with a smile, and nodded his approbation.  Then, taking off his own short and crooked sword, he girded it about Perseus, instead of the one which he had before worn.  “No sword but mine will answer your purpose,” observed he; “the blade has a most excellent temper, and will cut through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest twig.  And now we will set out.  The next thing is to find the Three Gray Women, who will tell us where to find the Nymphs.”  “The Three Gray Women!” cried Perseus, to whom this seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure; “pray, who may the Three Gray Women be? I never heard of them before.”  “They are three very strange old ladies,” said Quicksilver, laughing. “They have but one eye among them, and only one tooth.  Moreover, you must find them out by starlight, or in the dusk of the evening; for they never show themselves by the light either of the sun or moon.”  “But,” said Perseus, “why should I waste my time with these Three Gray Women?  Would it not be better to set out at once in search of the terrible Gorgons?”  “No, no,” answered his friend.  “There are other things to be done, before you can find your way to the Gorgons.  There is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies; and when we meet with them, you may be sure that the Gorgons are not a great way off.  Come, let us be stirring!”  Perseus, by this time, felt so much confidence in his companion’s sagacity, that he made no more objections, and professed himself ready to begin the adventure immediately.  They accordingly set out, and walked at a pretty brisk pace; so brisk, indeed, that Perseus found it rather difficult to keep up with his nimble friend Quicksilver.  To say the truth, he had a singular idea that Quicksilver was furnished with a pair of winged shoes, which, of course, helped him along marvellously. And then, too, when Perseus looked sideways at him, out of the corner of his eye, he seemed to see wings on the side of his head; although, if he turned a full gaze, there were no such things to be perceived, but only an odd kind of cap.  But, at all events, the twisted staff was evidently a great convenience to Quicksilver, and enabled him to proceed so fast, that Perseus, though a remarkably active young man, began to be out of breath.  “Here!” cried Quicksilver, at last,--for he knew well enough, rogue that he was, how hard Perseus found it to keep pace with him,--“take you the staff, for you need it a great deal more than I.  Are there no better walkers than yourself, in the island of Seriphus?”  “I could walk pretty well,” said Perseus, glancing slyly at his companion’s feet, “if I had only a pair of winged shoes.”  “We must see about getting you a pair,” answered Quicksilver.  But the staff helped Perseus along so bravely, that he no longer felt the slightest weariness.  In fact, the stick seemed to be alive in his hand, and to lend some of its life to Perseus.  He and Quicksilver now walked onward at their ease, talking very sociably together; and Quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures, and how well his wits had served him on various occasions, that Perseus began to think him a very wonderful person.  He evidently knew the world; and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge.  Perseus listened the more eagerly, in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard.  At last, he happened to recollect that Quicksilver had spoken of a sister, who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon.  “Where is she?” he inquired.  “Shall we not meet her soon?”  “All at the proper time,” said his companion.  “But this sister of mine, you must understand, is quite a different sort of character from myself. She is very grave and prudent, seldom smiles, never laughs, and makes it a rule not to utter a word unless she has something particularly profound to say.  Neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation.”  “Dear me!” ejaculated Perseus; “I shall be afraid to say a syllable.”  “She is a very accomplished person, I assure you,” continued Quicksilver, “and has all the arts and sciences at her fingers’ ends. In short, she is so immoderately wise, that many people call her wisdom personified.  But, to tell you the truth, she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste; and I think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a travelling companion as myself.  She has her good points, nevertheless; and you will find the benefit of them, in your encounter with the Gorgons.”  By this time it had grown quite dusk.  They were now come to a very wild and desert place, overgrown with shaggy bushes, and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there.  All was waste and desolate, in the gray twilight, which grew every moment more obscure.  Perseus looked about him, rather disconsolately, and asked Quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go.  “Hist!  Hist!” whispered his companion.  “Make no noise!  This is just the time and place to meet the Three Gray Women.  Be careful that they do not see you before you see them; for, though they have but a single eye among the three, it is as sharp-sighted as half a dozen common eyes.”  “But what must I do,” asked Perseus, “when we meet them?”  Quicksilver explained to Perseus how the Three Gray Women managed with their one eye.  They were in the habit, it seems, of changing it from one to another, as if it had been a pair of spectacles, or--which would have suited them better--quizzing-glass.  When one of the three had kept the eye a certain time, she took it out of the socket and passed it to one of her sisters, whose turn it might happen to be, and who immediately clapped it into her own head, and enjoyed a peep at the visible world.  Thus it will easily be understood that only one of the Three Gray Women could see, while the other two were in utter darkness; and, moreover, at the instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand, neither of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink.  I have heard of a great many strange things, in my day, and have witnessed not a few; but none, it seems to me, that can compare with the oddity of these Three Gray Women, all peeping through a single eye.  So thought Perseus, likewise, and was so astonished that he almost fancied his companion was joking with him, and that there were no such old women in the world.  “You will soon find whether I tell the truth or no,” observed Quicksilver.  “Hark! hush! Hist! hist!  There they come, now!”  Perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening, and there, sure enough, at no great distance off, he descried the Three Gray Women. The light being so faint, he could not well make out what sort of figures they were; only he discovered that they had long gray hair; and, as they came nearer, he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of an eye, in the middle of their foreheads.  But, in the middle of the third sister’s forehead, there was a very large, bright, and piercing eye, which sparkled like a great diamond in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9255"],["title","The Gorgon's Head (#3)"],["body","; and so penetrating did it seem to be, that Perseus could not help thinking it must possess the gift of seeing in the darkest midnight just as perfectly as at noonday.  The sight of three persons’ eyes was melted and collected into that single one.  Thus the three old dames got along about as comfortably, upon the whole, as if they could all see at once.  She who chanced to have the eye in her forehead led the other two by the hands, peeping sharply about her, all the while; insomuch that Perseus dreaded lest she should see right through the thick clump of bushes behind which he and Quicksilver had hidden themselves.  My stars! it was positively terrible to be within reach of so very sharp an eye!  But, before they reached the clump of bushes, one of the Three Gray Women spoke.  “Sister!  Sister Scarecrow!” cried she, “you have had the eye long enough.  It is my turn now!”  “Let me keep it a moment longer, Sister Nightmare,” answered Scarecrow. “I thought I had a glimpse of something behind that thick bush.”  “Well, and what of that?” retorted Nightmare, peevishly.  “Can’t I see into a thick bush as easily as yourself?  The eye is mine, as well as yours; and I know the use of it as well as you, or may be a little better.  I insist upon taking a peep immediately!”  But here the third sister, whose name was Shakejoint, began to complain, and said that it was her turn to have the eye, and that Scarecrow and Nightmare wanted to keep it all to themselves.  To end the dispute, old Dame Scarecrow took the eye out of her forehead, and held it forth in her hand.  “Take it, one of you,” cried she, “and quit this foolish quarrelling. For my part, I shall be glad of a little thick darkness.  Take it quickly, however, or I must clap it into my own head again!”  Accordingly, both Nightmare and Shakejoint stretched out their hands, groping eagerly to snatch the eye out of the hand of Scarecrow.  But, being both alike blind, they could not easily find where Scarecrow’s hand was; and Scarecrow, being now just as much in the dark as Shakejoint and Nightmare, could not at once meet either of their hands, in order to put the eye into it.  Thus (as you will see, with half an eye, my wise little auditors), these good old dames had fallen into a strange perplexity.  For, though the eye shone and glistened like a star, as Scarecrow held it out, yet the Gray Women caught not the least glimpse of its light, and were all three in utter darkness, from too impatient a desire to see.  Quicksilver was so much tickled at beholding Shakejoint and Nightmare both groping for the eye, and each finding fault with Scarecrow and one another, that he could scarcely help laughing aloud.  “Now is your time!” he whispered to Perseus.  “Quick, quick!  before they can clap the eye into either of their heads. Rush out upon the old ladies, and snatch it from Scarecrow’s hand!”  In an instant, while the Three Gray Women were still scolding each other, Perseus leaped front behind the clump of bushes, and made himself master of the prize.  The marvellous eye, as he held it in his hand, shone very brightly, and seemed to look up into his face with a knowing air, and an expression as if it would have winked, had it been provided with a pair of eyelids for that purpose.  But the Gray Women knew nothing of what had happened; and, each supposing that one of her sisters was in possession of the eye, they began their quarrel anew.  At last, as Perseus did not wish to put these respectable dames to greater inconvenience than was really necessary, he thought it right to explain the matter. “My good ladies,” said he, “pray do not be angry with one another.  If anybody is in fault, it is myself; for I have the honor to hold your very brilliant and excellent eye in my own hand!”  “You! you have our eye!  And who are you?” screamed the Three Gray Women, all in a breath; for they were terribly frightened, of course, at hearing a strange voice, and discovering that their eyesight had got into the hands of they could not guess whom.  “O, what shall we do, sisters? what shall we do?  We are all in the dark!  Give us our eye! Give us our one, precious, solitary eye!  You have two of your own Give us our eye!”  “Tell them,” whispered Quicksilver to Perseus, “that they shall have back the eye as soon as they direct you where to find the Nymphs who have the flying slippers, the magic wallet, and the helmet of darkness.”  “My dear, good, admirable old ladies,” said Perseus, addressing the Gray Women, “there is no occasion for putting yourselves into such a fright. I am by no means a bad young man.  You shall have back your eye, safe and sound, and as bright as ever, the moment you tell me where to find the Nymphs.”  “The Nymphs!  Goodness me! sisters, what Nymphs does he mean?” screamed Scarecrow.  “There are a great many Nymphs, people say; some that go a hunting in the woods, and some that live inside of trees, and some that have a comfortable home in fountains of water.  We know nothing at all about them.  We are three unfortunate old souls, that go wandering about in the dusk, and never had but one eye amongst us, and that one you have stolen away.  O, give it back, good stranger!--whoever you are, give it back!”  All this while the Three Gray Women were groping with their outstretched hands, and trying their utmost to get hold of Perseus.  But he took good care to keep out of their reach.  “My respectable dames,” said he,--for his mother had taught him always to use the greatest civility,--“I hold your eye fast in my hand, and shall keep it safely for you, until you please to tell me where to find these Nymphs.  The Nymphs, I mean, who keep the enchanted wallet, the flying slippers, and the what is it?--the helmet of invisibility.”  “Mercy on us, sisters! what is the young man talking about?” exclaimed Scarecrow, Nightmare, and Shakejoint, one to another, with great appearance of astonishment.  “A pair of flying slippers, quoth he!  His heels would quickly fly higher than his head, if he were silly enough to put them on.  And a helmet of invisibility!  How could a helmet make him invisible, unless it were big enough for him to hide under it?  And an enchanted wallet!  What sort of a contrivance may that be, I wonder? No, no, good stranger! we can tell you nothing of these marvellous things.  You have two eyes of your own, and we have but a single one amongst us three.  You can find out such wonders better than three blind old creatures, like us.”  Perseus, hearing them talk in this way, began really to think that the Gray Women knew nothing of the matter; and, as it grieved him to have put them to so much trouble, he was just on the point of restoring their eye and asking pardon for his rudeness in snatching it away.  But Quicksilver caught his hand.  “Don’t let them make a fool of you!” said he.  “These Three Gray Women are the only persons in the world that can tell you where to find the Nymphs; and, unless you get that information, you will never succeed in cutting off the head of Medusa with the snaky locks.  Keep fast hold of the eye, and all will go well.”  As it turned out, Quicksilver was in the right.  There are but few things that people prize so much as they do their eyesight; and the Gray Women valued their single eye as highly as if it had been half a dozen, which was the number they ought to have had.  Finding that there was no other way of recovering it, they at last told Perseus what he wanted to know.  No sooner had they done so, than he immediately, and with the utmost respect, clapped the eye into the vacant socket in one of their foreheads, thanked them for their kindness, and bade them farewell. Before the young man was out of hearing, however, they had got into a new dispute, because he happened to have given the eye to Scarecrow, who had already taken her turn of it when their trouble with Perseus commenced.   It is greatly to be feared that the Three Gray Women were very much in the habit of disturbing their mutual harmony by bickerings of this sort; which was the more pity, as they could not conveniently do without one another, and were evidently intended to be inseparable companions.  As a general rule, I would advise all people, whether sisters or brothers, old or young, who chance to have but one eye amongst them, to cultivate forbearance, and not all insist upon peeping through it at once.  Quicksilver and Perseus, in the mean time, were making the best of their way in quest of the Nymphs.  The old dames had given them such particular directions, that they were not long in finding them out. They proved to be very different persons from Nightmare Shakejoint, and Scarecrow; for, instead of being old, they were young and beautiful; and instead of one eye amongst the sisterhood, each Nymph had two exceedingly bright eyes of her own, with which she looked very kindly at Perseus.  They seemed to be acquainted with Quicksilver; and when he told them the adventure which Perseus had undertaken, they made no difficulty about giving him the valuable articles that were in their custody.  In the first place, they brought out what appeared to be a small purse, made of deer-skin, and curiously embroidered, and bade him be sure and keep it safe.  This was the magic wallet.  The Nymphs next produced a pair of shoes, or slippers, or sandals, with a nice little pair of wings at the heel of each.  “Put them on, Perseus,” said Quicksilver.  “You will find yourself as light-heeled as you can desire, for the remainder of our journey.”  So Perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on, while he laid the other on the ground by his side.  Unexpectedly, however, this other slipper spread its wings, fluttered up off the ground, and would probably have flown away, if Quicksilver had not made a leap, and luckily caught it in the air.  “Be more careful,” said he, as he gave it back to Perseus.  “It would frighten the birds, up aloft, if they should see a flying slipper"]]]
