And from the lesser orb the goodliest light, With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps The angel's once to Mary, thus replied: \"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last, Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright, As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest; And that as far in blessedness exceeding, As it hath grave beyond its virtue great. Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire, Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase, Whate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid, The better disclose his glory: whence The vision needs increasing, much increase The fervour, which it kindles; and that too The ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines More lively than that, and so preserves Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem, Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth Now covers.  Nor will such excess of light O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made Firm, and susceptible of all delight.\"  So ready and so cordial an \"Amen,\" Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear, Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd, Ere they were made imperishable flame.  And lo! forthwith there rose up round about A lustre over that already there, Of equal clearness, like the brightening up Of the horizon.  As at an evening hour Of twilight, new appearances through heav'n Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried; So there new substances, methought began To rise in view; and round the other twain Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.  O gentle glitter of eternal beam! With what a such whiteness did it flow, O'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair, So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd, Mind cannot follow it, nor words express Her infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'd Power to look up, and I beheld myself, Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss Translated: for the star, with warmer smile Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.  With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks The same in all, an holocaust I made To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd. And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd The fuming of that incense, when I knew The rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen And mantling crimson, in two listed rays The splendours shot before me, that I cried, \"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!\"  As leads the galaxy from pole to pole, Distinguish'd into greater lights and less, Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell; So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars, Those rays describ'd the venerable sign, That quadrants in the round conjoining frame. Here memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now. But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ Will pardon me for that I leave untold, When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy The glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn, And 'tween the summit and the base did move Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd. Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance, Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow, The atomies of bodies, long or short, To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line Checkers the shadow, interpos'd by art Against the noontide heat.  And as the chime Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help With many strings, a pleasant dining makes To him, who heareth not distinct the note; So from the lights, which there appear'd to me, Gather'd along the cross a melody, That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment Possess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymn Of lofty praises; for there came to me \"Arise and conquer,\" as to one who hears And comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy O'ercame, that never till that hour was thing That held me in so sweet imprisonment.  Perhaps my saying over bold appears, Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes, Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire. But he, who is aware those living seals Of every beauty work with quicker force, The higher they are ris'n; and that there I had not turn'd me to them; he may well Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse I do accuse me, and may own my truth; That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd, Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.     CANTO XV  True love, that ever shows itself as clear In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong, Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand Unwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers Should they not hearken, who, to give me will For praying, in accordance thus were mute? He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief, Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not, Despoils himself forever of that love.  As oft along the still and pure serene, At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire, Attracting with involuntary heed The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest, And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n, Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost, And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn, That on the dexter of the cross extends, Down to its foot, one luminary ran From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.  So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower, When he perceiv'd his son.  \"O thou, my blood! O most exceeding grace divine! to whom, As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate Been e'er unclos'd?\" so spake the light; whence I Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame My sight directed, and on either side Amazement waited me; for in her eyes Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace And of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith To hearing and to sight grateful alike, The spirit to his proem added things I understood not, so profound he spake; Yet not of choice but through necessity Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd Beyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight Of holy transport had so spent its rage, That nearer to the level of our thought The speech descended, the first sounds I heard Were, \"Best he thou, Triunal Deity! That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!\" Then follow'd: \"No unpleasant thirst, tho' long, Which took me reading in the sacred book, Whose leaves or white or dusky never change, Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light, From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her. Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes Begirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me From him transmitted, who is first of all, E'en as all numbers ray from unity; And therefore dost not ask me who I am, Or why to thee more joyous I appear, Than any other in this gladsome throng. The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue Both less and greater in that mirror look, In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown. But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever, Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire, May be contended fully, let thy voice, Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish, Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.\"  I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent, That to my will gave wings; and I began \"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells, Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt; For that they are so equal in the sun, From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat, As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means, In mortals, for the cause ye well discern, With unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal I Experience inequality like this, And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart, For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st This precious jewel, let me hear thy name.\"  \"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect Even, hath pleas'd me:\" thus the prompt reply Prefacing, next it added; \"he, of whom Thy kindred appellation comes, and who, These hundred years and more, on its first ledge Hath circuited the mountain, was my son And thy great grandsire.  Well befits, his long Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.  \"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark, Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon, Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace. She had no armlets and no head-tires then, No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye More than the person did.  Time was not yet, When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale. For fear the age and dowry should exceed On each side just proportion.  House was none Void of its family; nor yet had come Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats Of chamber prowess.  Montemalo yet O'er our suburban turret rose; as much To be surpass in fall, as in its rising. I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone; And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks, His lady leave the glass.

Each sure of burial in her native land, And none left desolate a-bed for France! One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy: Another, with her maidens, drawing off The tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome. A Salterello and Cianghella we Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.  \"In such compos'd and seemly fellowship, Such faithful and such fair equality, In so sweet household, Mary at my birth Bestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there In your old baptistery, I was made Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto.  \"From Valdipado came to me my spouse, And hence thy surname grew.

INTRODUCTION   When the first days of August loured over the world, time seemed to stand still. A universal astonishment and confusion fell, as upon a flock of sheep perplexed by strange dogs. But now, though never before was a St. Lucy's Day so black with \"absence, darkness, death,\" Christmas is gone. Spring comes swiftly, the almond trees flourish. Easter will soon be here. Life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring hell itself into the world, but that Nature ever patiently waits to be his natural paradise. Yet still a kind of instinctive blindness blots out the prospect of the future. Until the long horror of the war is gone from our minds, we shall be able to think of nothing that has not for its background a chaotic darkness. Like every obsession, it gnaws at thought, follows us into our dreams and returns with the morning. But there have been other wars. And humanity, after learning as best it may their brutal lesson, has survived them. Just as the young soldier leaves home behind him and accepts hardship and danger as to the manner born, so, when he returns again, life will resume its old quiet wont. Nature is not idle even in the imagination. It is man's salvation to forget no less than it is his salvation to remember. And it is wise even in the midst of the conflict to look back on those that are past and to prepare for the returning problems of the future.  When Whitman wrote his \"Democratic Vistas,\" the long embittered war between the Northern and Southern States of America was a thing only of yesterday. It is a headlong amorphous production--a tangled meadow of \"leaves of grass\" in prose. But it is as cogent to-day as it was when it was written:      To the ostent of the senses and eyes [he writes], the influences     which stamp the world's history are wars, uprisings, or downfalls     of dynasties.... These, of course, play their part; yet, it may     be, a single new thought, imagination, abstract principle ... put     in shape by some great literatus, and projected among mankind,     may duly cause changes, growths, removals, greater than the     longest and bloodiest war, or the most stupendous merely     political, dynastic, or commercial overturn.  The literatus who realized this had his own message in mind. And yet, justly. For those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material comforts of his country, and ask, Are not these better indeed than any utterances even of greatest rhapsodic, artist, or literatus? he has his irrefutable answer. He surveys the New York of 1870, \"its façades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design,\" etc., in his familiar catalogical jargon, and shutting his eyes to its glow and grandeur, inquires in return, Are there indeed _men_ here worthy the name? Are there perfect women? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people? Is there a great moral and religious civilization--the only justification of a great material one? We ourselves in good time shall have to face and to answer these questions. They search our keenest hopes of the peace that is coming. And we may be fortified perhaps by the following queer proof of history repeating itself:      Never, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholster'd exterior     appearance and show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea     of caste, and on the sufficiency of mere outside     acquisition--never were glibness, verbal intellect, more the     test, the emulation--more loftily elevated as head and sample--     than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day.     The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods. The word of     the modern, say these voices, is the word Culture.  Whitman had no very tender regard for the Germany of his time. He fancied that the Germans were like the Chinese, only less graceful and refined and more brutish. But neither had he any particular affection for any relic of Europe. \"Never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract friendliness of a single _Government_ of the Old World.\" He accepted selections from its literature for the new American Adam. But even its greatest poets were not America's, and though he might welcome even Juvenal, it was for use and not for worship. We have to learn, he insists, that the best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions, and of self-respect. In our children rests every hope and promise, and therefore in their mothers. \"Disengage yourselves from parties.... These savage and wolfish parties alarm me.... Hold yourself judge and master over all of them.\" Only faith can save us, the faith in ourselves and in our fellow-men which is of the true faith in goodness and in God. The idea of the mass of men, so fresh and free, so loving and so proud, filled this poet with a singular awe. Passionately he pleads for the dignity of the common people. It is the average man of a land that is important. To win the people back to a proud belief and confidence in life, to rapture in this wonderful world, to love and admiration--this was his burning desire. I demand races of orbic bards, he rhapsodizes, sweet democratic despots, to dominate and even destroy. The Future! Vistas! The throes of birth are upon us. Allons, camarado!  He could not despair. \"Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?\" he asks himself in \"Drum-Taps.\" But wildest shuttlecock of criticism though he is, he has never yet been charged with looking only on the dark side of things. Once, he says, \"Once, before the war (alas! I dare not say how many times the mood has come!), I too, was fill'd with doubt and gloom.\" His part in it soothed, mellowed, deepened his great nature. He had himself witnessed such misery, cruelty, and abomination as it is best just now, perhaps, not to read about. One fact alone is enough; that over fifty thousand Federal soldiers perished of starvation in Southern prisons. Malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had wrecked his health. During 1862-65 he visited, he says, eighty to a hundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers, comprehending all, slighting none. Rebel or compatriot, it made no difference. \"I loved the young man,\" he cries again and again. Pity and fatherliness were in his face, for his heart was full of them. Mr. Gosse has described \"the old Gray\" as he saw him in 1884, in his bare, littered sun-drenched room in Camden, shared by kitten and canary:      He sat with a very curious pose of the head thrown backward, as     if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than     other people do, and thus tilting his face a little upwards. With     his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of     the interlocutor he seemed to pass into a state of absolute     passivity ... the glassy eyes half closed, the large knotted     hands spread out before him. He resembled, in fact, nothing so     much as \"a great old grey Angora Tom,\" alert in repose, serenely     blinking under his combed waves of hair, with eyes inscrutably     dreaming.... As I stood in dull, deserted Mickle Street once     more, my heart was full of affection for this beautiful old man     ... this old rhapsodist in his empty room, glorified by patience     and philosophy.  Whitman was then sixty-five. In a portrait of thirty years before there is just a wraith of that feline dream, perhaps, but it is a face of a rare grace and beauty that looks out at us, of a profound kindness and compassion. And, in the eyes, not so much penetration as visionary absorption. Such was the man to whom nothing was unclean, nothing too trivial (except \"pale poetlings lisping cadenzas _piano_,\" who then apparently thronged New York) to take to himself. Intensest, indomitablest of individualists, he exulted in all that appertains to that forked radish, Man. This contentious soul of mine, he exclaims ecstatically; Viva: the attack! I have been born the same as the war was born; I lull nobody, and you will never understand me: maybe I am non-literary and un-decorous.... I have written impromptu, and shall let it all go at that. Let me at least be human! Human, indeed, he was, a tender, all-welcoming host of Everyman, of his idolized (if somewhat overpowering) American democracy. Man in the street, in his swarms, poor crazed faces in the State asylum, prisoners in "]]]
