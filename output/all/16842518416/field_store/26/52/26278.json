SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK.     _Poet._   O a new song, a free song,   Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,   By the wind's voice and that of the drum,   By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and father's             voice,   Low on the ground and high in the air,   On the ground where father and child stand,   In the upward air where their eyes turn,   Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.    Words! bookwords! what are you?   Words no more, for hearken and see,   My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,   With the banner and pennant a-flapping.    I'll weave the chord and twine in,   Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,   I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs             whizz,   (As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,   Crying with trumpet voice, _Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!_)   I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of             joy.   Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,   With the banner and pennant a-flapping.    _Pennant._   Come up here, bard, bard,   Come up here, soul, soul,   Come up here, dear little child,   To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless             light.    _Child._   Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?   And what does it say to me all the while?    _Father._   Nothing my babe you see in the sky,   And nothing at all to you it says--but look you my babe,   Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the             money-shops opening,   And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with             goods;   These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!   How envied by all the earth.    _Poet._   Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,   On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,   On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,   The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,   Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.    But I am not the sea nor the red sun,   I am not the wind with girlish laughter,   Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,   Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,   But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,   Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,   Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,   And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and             pennant,   Aloft there flapping and flapping.    _Child._   O father it is alive--it is full of people--it has children,   O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,   I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!   O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast--O my father,   It is so broad it covers the whole sky.    _Father._   Cease, cease, my foolish babe,   What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much it displeases me;   Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants             aloft,   But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd             houses.    _Banner and Pennant._   Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,   To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,   Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and yet we know             not why,   For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,   Only flapping in the wind?    _Poet._   I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,   I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,   I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!   I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,   I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,   I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird,             and look down as from a height,   I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities             with wealth incalculable,   I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or             barns,   I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going             up, or finished,   I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by             the locomotives,   I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New             Orleans,   I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile             hovering,   I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern             plantation, and again to California;   Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,             earn'd wages,   See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty             States, (and many more to come,)   See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;   Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped             like a sword,   Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards             have rais'd it,   Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,   Discarding peace over all the sea and land.    _Banner and Pennant._   Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!   No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,   We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,   Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor any             five, nor ten,)   Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,   But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines             below, are ours,   And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,   And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,   Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we             over all,   Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square             miles, the capitals,   The forty millions of people,--O bard! in life and death supreme,   We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,   Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,   This song to the soul of one poor little child.    _Child._   O my father I like not the houses,   They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,   But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I             like,   That pennant I would be and must be.    _Father._   Child of mine you fill me with anguish,   To be that pennant would be too fearful,   Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,   It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,   Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you             to do with them?   With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?    _Banner._   Demons and death then I sing,   Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,   And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of             children,   Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the             sea,   And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,   And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and             pines,   And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the             hot sun shining south,   And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore, and             my Western shore the same,   And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with             bends and chutes,   And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of             Missouri,   The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,   Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield             of all,   Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,   No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,   But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,   Croaking like crows here in the wind.    _Poet_.   My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,   Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and             resolute,   I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,   My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)   I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,   Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!   Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity,             (if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses             to destroy them,   You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full             of comfort, built with money,   May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all             stand fast;)   O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor             the material good nutriment,   Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,   Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and             carrying cargoes,   Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth I             see you,   Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars,             (ever-enlarging stars,)   Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,             measuring the sky,   (Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,   While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift,             thrift;)   O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing so             curious,   Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody             death, loved by me,   So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the             night!  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],["title","Drum-Taps (#4)"],["body"," Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute             owner of all)--O banner and pennant!   I too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines             are nothing--I see them not,   I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I             sing you only,   Flapping up there in the wind.     RISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS.   1    Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer             sweep,   Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave             me,   Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,   I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd the             Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus,   I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,   I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,   I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,   I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over,   I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,   Saw from below what arose and mounted (O superb! O wild as my heart,             and powerful!)   Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,   Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast             amid the din they chased each other across the sky;   These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive             and masterful,   All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,   Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.  2    'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,   Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,   Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,   Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,   Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,   Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed             inexhaustible?)   What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of the             mountains and sea?   What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?   Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?   Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,   Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,             unchain'd;   What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,   How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!   How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the             flashes of lightning!   How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through             the dark by those flashes of lightning!   (Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,   In a lull of the deafening confusion.)  3    Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!   And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!   Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,   My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong             nutriment,   Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only             half satisfied,   One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground             before me,   Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically             hissing low;   The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the             certainties suitable to me,   Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's             dauntlessness,   I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,   I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I             waited long;   But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,   I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities             electric,   I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,   Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,   No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.     VIRGINIA--THE WEST.     The noble sire fallen on evil days,   I saw with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,   (Memories of old in abeyance, love and faith in abeyance,)   The insane knife toward the Mother of All.    The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,   I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio's waters and of             Indiana,   To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,   Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.    Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,   As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against             me, and why seek my life?   When you yourself forever provide to defend me?   For you provided me Washington--and now these also.     CITY OF SHIPS.     City of ships!   (O the black ships! O the fierce ships!   O the beautiful sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)   City of the world! (for all races are here,   All the lands of the earth make contributions here;)   City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!   City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and             out with eddies and foam!   City of wharves and stores--city of tall façades of marble and iron!   Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!   Spring up, O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself,             warlike!   Fear not--submit to no models but your own O city!   Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!   I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted I have             adopted,   Good or bad I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn any             thing,   I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more,   In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,   War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!     THE CENTENARIAN'S STORY.     _Volunteer of 1861-2, (at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting the             Centenarian.)_    Give me your hand old Revolutionary,   The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)   Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and             extra years,   You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,   Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.   Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,   On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,   There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,   Do you hear the officers giving their orders?   Do you hear the clank of the muskets?    Why what comes over you now old man?   Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?   The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles.   Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,   While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,   Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,   O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.   But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,   Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!    As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,   Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,   You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.    _The Centenarian._    When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,   But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,   And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they             ran,   And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and             south-east and south-west,   Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,   And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and             suddenly raged,   As eighty-five years a-gone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of             friends,   But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is I             took part in it,   Walking then this hill-top, this same ground.    Aye, this is the ground,   My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,   The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,   Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,   I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,   I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;   Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.    As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,   It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,   By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up             his unsheath'd sword,   It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.    'Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,   We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,   And the transports swarming with soldiers.    A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.    Twenty thousand were brought against us,   A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.   I tell not now the whole of the battle,   But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the             red-coats,   Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,   And how long and well it stood confronting death.    Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting             death?   It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,   Raised in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to             the General.    Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,   Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at             night,   The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing             their guns,   That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.    The General watch'd them from this hill,   They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their"]]]
