She does not explain what God has explained, but celebrates these Divine mysteries, as they were held and celebrated for one thousand years after our Lord ascended into heaven, before there was any East or West arrayed against each other in the Church of God.  Surely we may and ought to be first to hold up the olive branch of peace over strife, and say, \"Sirs, ye are brethren.\"  In so grave a matter as the restoration of organic unity, we may not surrender anything which is of Divine authority, or accept terms of communion which are contrary to God's Word.  We cannot recognize any usurpation of the rights and prerogatives of national Churches which have a common ancestry, lest we heal \"the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,\" and say \"peace, where there is no peace;\" but we do say that all which is temporary and of human choice or preference we will forego, from our love to our own kinsmen in Christ.  The Church of the Reconciliation will be an historical and Catholic Church in its ministry, its faith, and its sacraments.  It will inherit the promises of its Divine Lord.  It will preserve all which is catholic and Divine.  It will adopt and use all instrumentalities of any existing organization which will aid it in doing the Lord's work.  It will put away all which is individual, narrow, and sectarian.  It will concede to all who hold the faith all the liberty wherewith Christ hath made His children free.   _Missions_.--In the presence of brethren who bear in their bodies the marks of the Lord Jesus, I hardly know how to clothe in words my thoughts as I speak of Missions.  The providence of God has broken down impenetrable barriers--the doors of hermit nations have been opened; commerce has bound men in common interests, and so prepared \"a highway for our God\"--Japan, India, China, Africa, Polynesia, amid the solitudes of icy north, and in the lands of tropic suns, world-wide there are signs of the coming of the kingdom of Jesus Christ.  The veil which has so long blinded the eyes of the ancient people, our Lord's kinsmen according to the flesh, is being taken away.  We bless God for the good example of martyrs like Patteson, Mackenzie, Parker, Hannington, and others, who have laid down their lives for the Lord Jesus.  We rejoice that our branch of the Church has been counted worthy to add to the names of those who \"came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\"  \"A great and effectual door is opened.\"  There is no country on the earth where we may not carry the Gospel.  The wealth of the world is largely in Christian hands.  The Church only needs faith to grasp the opportunity to do the work.  In the presence of fields so white for the harvest, we must ask, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\"  1. There must be unceasing, prevailing intercessory prayer for those whom we send out to heathen lands.  The hearts of all Christian nations were turned with anxious solicitude to that brave servant of God and His country in Khartoum.  Shall we feel less for the servants of Christ who have given up home and country to suffer and it may be to die for Him? Some of us remember that when Missions were destroyed, when clouds were all around us, and the very ground drifting from under our feet, that we were made brave to work and wait for the salvation of God by the prayers which went up to God for us.  When \"prayers were made without ceasing of the Church unto God,\" the fast-closed doors of the prison were opened for the Apostles.  It will be so again.  2. There must be the entire consecration of all unto Christ.  The wisdom of Paul and the eloquence of Apollos may plant, but \"God alone giveth the increase.\"  If success comes, if \"the rod of the priesthood bud and blossom and bear fruit,\" it must be \"laid up in the ark of God.\"  He will not give His glory to another.  The work is Christ's.  \"We are ambassadors for Him.\"  \"I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit.\"  3. They who would win souls must have a ripe knowledge of the sacred Scriptures.  \"They were written by inspiration of God. . . . that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" Our orders may be unquestioned, our doctrine perfect in every line and feature, but we shall not reach the hearts of men unless we preach Christ out of an experimental knowledge of the truths of Divine Revelation.  There is but one Book which can bring light to homes of sorrow, one light to scatter clouds and darkness, one message to lead wandering folk unto God.  This blessed Book will be to every soldier and lonely missionary what it was to Livingstone dying alone in Africa, or to Captain Gardiner dead on the desolate shores of Patagonia, whose finger pointed to the words, \"The Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.\"  4. We must love all whom Christ loves.  We may have the gift of teaching, we may understand all mysteries, we may have all knowledge, we may bestow all our goods to the poor, we may even give our bodies to be burned, but without that love which comes alone from Christ, we shall be \"as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.\"  With St. Paul we must say, \"Whereinsoever Christ is preached I do rejoice, and will rejoice.\"  5. Above all gifts we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  When this consecration comes there will be no cry of an empty treasury.  We shall no longer be weary with the bleating of lost sheep, to whom we have to say, I have no means and no shepherd to send you.    _Christian Work_--We rejoice at every sign that Christians realize that wealth is a sacred trust, for which they shall give an account.  We rejoice more that they are giving that personal service which is a law of His kingdom.  Men and women of culture and gentle birth are going into the abodes of sickness and sorrow to comfort stricken homes and lead sinful folk to the Saviour.  Brotherhoods, Sisterhoods, and deaconesses are multiplying.  Never was there greater need for their holy work.  Many of our own baptized children have drifted away from all faith.  To thousands God is a name, the Bible a tradition, faith an opinion, and heaven and hell fables.  But that which gives us the deepest sadness and makes all Christian work more difficult is that so many of those to whom the people look for example have given up the Bible, the Lord's Day, the house of God, and Christian faith.  Alas! they are telling these weary toilers whose lives are clouded by anxiety and sorrow that there is no hereafter.  \"They know not what they do.\" They are sowing to the wind and will reap the whirlwind.  May God show them the danger before if is too late!  The loss of faith is the loss of everything; without it morality becomes prudence or imprudence.  When the tie which binds man to God is broken all other ties snap asunder. No nation has survived the loss of its religion.  We are appalled at the mad cry of anarchy which tramples all which we hold dear for time and eternity under its feet.  We cannot look into its face without seeing the lineaments of that man of sin who \"opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God and worshipped.\"  Antichrist is he who usurps the place of Christ.  \"He is antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son.\"  Our hearts go out in pity for those whose mechanical ideas of the universe may be a revolt from a mechanical theology which has lost sight of the Fatherhood of God.  We stand where two ways meet. We shall take care of the people or the people will take care of us. The people are the rulers; the power of the future is in their hands. Limit their horizon to this life, let penury, sickness, and sorrow change the man to a wolf, let him know no God and Father Who hears his cry, no Saviour to help, no brother to bind up his wounds, let there be on the one side wealth and luxury and wanton waste, and on the other side poverty, misery, and despair, and there will be, as there has been, a cry for blood.  We wonder why men pass by the Church to found clubs and brotherhoods and orders.  They will have them, and they ought to have them, until the Church is in its Divine love what its Founder designed it to be--the brotherhood in Christ of the children of our God and Father.  What the world needs to-day is not alms, not hospitals, not homes of mercy alone.  It needs the spirit and the power of the love of Christ.  It needs the voice, the ear, the hand, and the heart of Christ seen in and working in His children.  No powers of government, no _prestige_ of social position, no prerogatives of Churchly authority can meet the issues of this hour; we have waited already too long. Brotherhood men will have, and it will be the brotherhood of the commune, or brotherhood in Christ as the children of our God and Father. Infidelity answers no questions, heals no wounds, fulfils no hopes.  The Gospel will do, is doing, to-day what it has done through all the ages: leading men out of sin and darkness and despair to the liberty of sons of God.   In a day of division and unrest there will be many questions which perplex earnest souls.  Some will dwell on the subjective side of the faith, others will think most of its manifestations in the life.  These questions will affect organization for Christian work, public worship, and find expression in the ritual of the Church.  There is no room for differences if Christ be first, Christ be last, and Christ in everything.  The ritual of the Church must be the expression of her life.  It must symbolize her faith; it must be subject to her authority. As the years go by worship will be more beautiful.  The \"garments of the king's daughter may be of wrought gold,\" and she \"clothed in raiment of needlework,\" but \"she will have a name that she liveth and is dead,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8732"],["title","Through the Fray: A Tale of the Luddite Riots (#0)"],["body","THE FRAY  A TALE OF THE LUDDITE RIOTS   By G. A. Henty     PREFACE   My Dear Lads:  The beginning of the present century, glorious as it was for British arms abroad, was a dark time to those who lived by their daily labor at home. The heavy taxation entailed by the war, the injury to trade, and the enormous prices of food, all pressed heavily upon the working classes. The invention of improved machinery, vast as has been the increase of trade which it has brought about, at first pressed heavily upon the hand workers, who assigned all their distress to the new inventions. Hence a movement arose, which did much damage and for a time threatened to be extremely formidable. It had its ramifications through all the manufacturing districts of England, the object being the destruction of the machinery, and a return to the old methods of work. The troubles which occurred in various parts of the country were known as the Luddite Riots, and the secret body which organized them was called King or General Lud. In the present story I have endeavored to give you an idea of the state of things which prevailed in Yorkshire, where, among the croppers and others employed in the woolen manufactures, was one of the most formidable branches of the secret association. The incidents of the murder of Mr. Horsfall and the attack upon Mr. Cartwright's mill are strictly accurate in all their details.  In this story I have left the historical battlefields, across so many of which I have taken you, and have endeavored to show that there are peaceful battles to be fought and victories to be won every jot as arduous and as difficult as those contested under arms. In “Facing Death” my hero won such a battle. He had to fight against external circumstances, and step by step, by perseverance, pluck, and determination, made his way in life. In the present tale my hero's enemy was within, and although his victory was at last achieved the victor was well nigh worsted in the fray. We have all such battles to fight, dear lads; may we all come unscathed and victorious through the fray!  Yours sincerely,  G. A. Henty     CHAPTER I: A FISHING EXPEDITION   It has just struck one, and the boys are streaming out from the schoolroom of Mr. Hathorn's academy in the little town of Marsden in Yorkshire. Their appearance would create some astonishment in the minds of lads of the present generation, for it was the year 1807, and their attire differed somewhat materially from that now worn. They were for the most part dressed in breeches tight at the knee, and buttoning up outside the close fitting jacket nearly under the arms, so that they seemed almost devoid of waist. At the present moment they were bareheaded; but when they went beyond the precincts of the school they wore stiff caps, flat and very large at the top, and with far projecting peaks.  They were not altogether a happy looking set of boys, and many of their cheeks were stained with tears and begrimed with dirt from the knuckles which had been used to wipe them away; for there was in the year 1807 but one known method of instilling instruction into the youthful mind, namely, the cane, and one of the chief qualifications of a schoolmaster was to be able to hit hard and sharp.  Mr. Hathorn, judged by this standard, stood very high in his profession; his cane seemed to whiz through the air, so rapidly and strongly did it descend, and he had the knack of finding out tender places, and of hitting them unerringly.  Any one passing in front of the schoolhouse during the hours when the boys were at their lessons would be almost sure to hear the sharp cracks of the cane, followed sometimes by dead silence, when the recipient of the blows was of a sturdy and Spartan disposition, but more frequently by shrieks and cries.  That Hathorn's boys hated their master was almost a matter of course. At the same time they were far from regarding him as an exceptional monster of cruelty, for they knew from their friends that flogging prevailed almost everywhere, and accepted it as a necessary portion of the woes of boyhood. Indeed, in some respects, when not smarting under the infliction, they were inclined to believe that their lot was, in comparison with that of others, a fortunate one; for whereas in many schools the diet was so poor and bad that the boys were half starved, at Hathorn's if their food was simple and coarse it was at least wholesome and abundant.  Mr. Hathorn, in fact, intended, and as he quite believed with success, to do his duty by his boys. They were sent to him to be taught, and he taught them through the medium then recognized as most fitting for the purpose--the cane; while, as far as an abundance of porridge for breakfast, and of heavy pudding at dinner, with twice a week an allowance of meat, the boys were unstinted. He would indeed point with pride to his pupils when their parents assembled at the annual presentation of prizes.  “Look at them!” he would say proudly. “None of your half starved skeletons here--well filled out and in good condition every boy of them--no stint of porridge here. It keeps them in good health and improves their learning; for, mark you, a plump boy feels the cane twice as much as a skinny one; it stings, my dear sir, it stings, and leaves its mark; whereas there is no getting at a boy whose clothes hang like bags about him.”  This was no doubt true, and the boys themselves were conscious of it, and many had been the stern resolutions made while smarting in agony that henceforward food should be eschewed, or taken only in sufficient quantities to keep life together. But boys' appetites are stronger than boys' resolutions, and in the end there was never any marked falling off in the consumption of viands at Hathorn's.  Like other things punishment fails when administered in excess. There was no disgrace whatever in what was common to all, for although some of the boys of superior ability and perseverance would escape with a smaller amount of punishment than their fellows, none could hope to escape altogether. Thus it was only the pain that they had to bear, and even this became to some extent deadened by repetition, and was forgotten as soon as inflicted, save when a sudden movement caused a sharp pain in back or leg. Once in the playground their spirits revived, and except a few whose recent punishment incapacitated them for a time from active exercise, the whole were soon intent upon their games.  One only of the party wore his cap, and he after a few minutes left the others, and went toward a door which led from the playground into the road.  “Don't be long, Sankey; come back as soon as you can, you know we agreed to go fishing this afternoon.”  “All right, Tompkins; I will come back directly I have done my dinner. I expect I shall have finished quite as soon as you will.”  Edward Sankey, who was regarded with envy by his schoolfellows, was the only home boarder at Hathorn's; for, as a general thing, the master set his face against the introduction of home boarders. They were, he considered, an element of disturbance; they carry tales to and from the school; they cause discontent among the other boys, and their parents are in the habit of protesting and interfering. Not, indeed, that parents in those days considered it in any way a hardship for their boys to suffer corporal punishment; they had been flogged at school, and they believed that they had learned their lessons all the better for it. Naturally the same thing would happen to their sons. Still mothers are apt to be weak and soft hearted, and therefore Mr. Hathorn objected to home boarders.  He had made an exception in Sankey's case; his father was of a different type to those of the majority of his boys; he had lost his leg at the battle of Assaye, and had been obliged to leave the army, and having but small means beyond his pension, had settled near the quiet little Yorkshire town as a place where he could live more cheaply than in more bustling localities. He had, when he first came, no acquaintances whatever in the place, and therefore would not be given to discuss with the parents of other boys the doings in the school. Not that Mr. Hathorn was afraid of discussion, for he regarded his school as almost perfect of its kind. Still it was his fixed opinion that discussion was, as a general rule, unadvisable. Therefore, when Captain Sankey, a few weeks after taking up his residence in the locality, made a proposal to him that his son should attend his school as a home boarder, Mr. Hathorn acceded to the proposition, stating frankly his objections, as a rule, to boys of that class.  “I shall not interfere,” Captain Sankey said. “Of course boys must be thrashed, and provided that the punishment is not excessive, and that it is justly administered, I have nothing to say against it. Boys must be punished, and if you don't flog you have to confine them, and in my opinion that is far worse for a boy's temper, spirit, and health.”  So Ned Sankey went to Hathorn's, and was soon a great favorite there. Just at first he was regarded as a disobliging fellow because he adhered strictly to a stipulation which Mr. Hathorn had made, that he should not bring things in from the town for his school fellows. Only once a week, on the Saturday half holiday, were the boys allowed outside the bounds of the wall round the playground, and although on Wednesday an old woman was allowed to come into those precincts to sell fruit, cakes, and sweets, many articles were wanted in the course of the week, and the boys took it much amiss for a time that Ned refused to act as their messenger; but he was firm in his refusals. His father had told him not to do so, and his father's word was law to him; but when the boys saw that in all other respects he was a thoroughly good fellow, they soon forgave him what they considered his undue punctiliousness, and he became a prime favorite in the school.  It is due to Mr. Hathorn to say that"]]]
