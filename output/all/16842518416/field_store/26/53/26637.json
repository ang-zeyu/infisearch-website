FRANK BAUM      This Book is Dedicated   To My Granddaughter   OZMA BAUM     To My Readers  Some of my youthful readers are developing wonderful imaginations. This pleases me. Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination has given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine and the automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities. So I believe that dreams--day dreams, you know, with your eyes wide open and your brain-machinery whizzing--are likely to lead to the betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman most apt to create, to invent, and therefore to foster civilization. A prominent educator tells me that fairy tales are of untold value in developing imagination in the young. I believe it.  Among the letters I receive from children are many containing suggestions of \"what to write about in the next Oz Book.\" Some of the ideas advanced are mighty interesting, while others are too extravagant to be seriously considered--even in a fairy tale. Yet I like them all, and I must admit that the main idea in \"The Lost Princess of Oz\" was suggested to me by a sweet little girl of eleven who called to see me and to talk about the Land of Oz. Said she: \"I s'pose if Ozma ever got lost, or stolen, ev'rybody in Oz would be dreadful sorry.\"  That was all, but quite enough foundation to build this present story on. If you happen to like the story, give credit to my little friend's clever hint.  L.

FRANK BAUM    CHAPTER 1  A TERRIBLE LOSS   There could be no doubt of the fact: Princess Ozma, the lovely girl ruler of the Fairyland of Oz, was lost.  She had completely disappeared.  Not one of her subjects--not even her closest friends--knew what had become of her.  It was Dorothy who first discovered it.  Dorothy was a little Kansas girl who had come to the Land of Oz to live and had been given a delightful suite of rooms in Ozma's royal palace just because Ozma loved Dorothy and wanted her to live as near her as possible so the two girls might be much together.  Dorothy was not the only girl from the outside world who had been welcomed to Oz and lived in the royal palace.  There was another named Betsy Bobbin, whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with Ozma, and still another named Trot, who had been invited, together with her faithful companion Cap'n Bill, to make her home in this wonderful fairyland.  The three girls all had rooms in the palace and were great chums; but Dorothy was the dearest friend of their gracious Ruler and only she at any hour dared to seek Ozma in her royal apartments.  For Dorothy had lived in Oz much longer than the other girls and had been made a Princess of the realm.  Betsy was a year older than Dorothy and Trot was a year younger, yet the three were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to have nice times together.  It was while the three were talking together one morning in Dorothy's room that Betsy proposed they make a journey into the Munchkin Country, which was one of the four great countries of the Land of Oz ruled by Ozma.  \"I've never been there yet,\" said Betsy Bobbin, \"but the Scarecrow once told me it is the prettiest country in all Oz.\"  \"I'd like to go, too,\" added Trot.   \"All right,\" said Dorothy.  \"I'll go and ask Ozma.  Perhaps she will let us take the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, which would be much nicer for us than having to walk all the way.  This Land of Oz is a pretty big place when you get to all the edges of it.\"  So she jumped up and went along the halls of the splendid palace until she came to the royal suite, which filled all the front of the second floor.  In a little waiting room sat Ozma's maid, Jellia Jamb, who was busily sewing.  \"Is Ozma up yet?\" inquired Dorothy.  \"I don't know, my dear,\" replied Jellia.  \"I haven't heard a word from her this morning.  She hasn't even called for her bath or her breakfast, and it is far past her usual time for them.\"  \"That's strange!\" exclaimed the little girl.  \"Yes,\" agreed the maid, \"but of course no harm could have happened to her.  No one can die or be killed in the Land of Oz, and Ozma is herself a powerful fairy, and she has no enemies so far as we know. Therefore I am not at all worried about her, though I must admit her silence is unusual.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully, \"she has overslept.  Or she may be reading or working out some new sort of magic to do good to her people.\"  \"Any of these things may be true,\" replied Jellia Jamb, \"so I haven't dared disturb our royal mistress.  You, however, are a privileged character, Princess, and I am sure that Ozma wouldn't mind at all if you went in to see her.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy, and opening the door of the outer chamber, she went in.  All was still here.  She walked into another room, which was Ozma's boudoir, and then, pushing back a heavy drapery richly broidered with threads of pure gold, the girl entered the sleeping-room of the fairy Ruler of Oz.  The bed of ivory and gold was vacant; the room was vacant; not a trace of Ozma was to be found.  Very much surprised, yet still with no fear that anything had happened to her friend, Dorothy returned through the boudoir to the other rooms of the suite.  She went into the music room, the library, the laboratory, the bath, the wardrobe, and even into the great throne room, which adjoined the royal suite, but in none of these places could she find Ozma.  So she returned to the anteroom where she had left the maid, Jellia Jamb, and said:  \"She isn't in her rooms now, so she must have gone out.\"  \"I don't understand how she could do that without my seeing her,\" replied Jellia, \"unless she made herself invisible.\"  \"She isn't there, anyhow,\" declared Dorothy.  \"Then let us go find her,\" suggested the maid, who appeared to be a little uneasy.  So they went into the corridors, and there Dorothy almost stumbled over a queer girl who was dancing lightly along the passage.  \"Stop a minute, Scraps!\" she called, \"Have you seen Ozma this morning?\"  \"Not I!\" replied the queer girl, dancing nearer.  \"I lost both my eyes in a tussle with the Woozy last night, for the creature scraped 'em both off my face with his square paws.  So I put the eyes in my pocket, and this morning Button-Bright led me to Aunt Em, who sewed 'em on again.  So I've seen nothing at all today, except during the last five minutes.  So of course I haven't seen Ozma.\"  \"Very well, Scraps,\" said Dorothy, looking curiously at the eyes, which were merely two round, black buttons sewed upon the girl's face.  There were other things about Scraps that would have seemed curious to one seeing her for the first time.  She was commonly called \"the Patchwork Girl\" because her body and limbs were made from a gay-colored patchwork quilt which had been cut into shape and stuffed with cotton. Her head was a round ball stuffed in the same manner and fastened to her shoulders.  For hair, she had a mass of brown yarn, and to make a nose for her a part of the cloth had been pulled out into the shape of a knob and tied with a string to hold it in place. Her mouth had been carefully made by cutting a slit in the proper place and lining it with red silk, adding two rows of pearls for teeth and a bit of red flannel for a tongue.  In spite of this queer make-up, the Patchwork Girl was magically alive and had proved herself not the least jolly and agreeable of the many quaint characters who inhabit the astonishing Fairyland of Oz. Indeed, Scraps was a general favorite, although she was rather flighty and erratic and did and said many things that surprised her friends. She was seldom still, but loved to dance, to turn handsprings and somersaults, to climb trees and to indulge in many other active sports.  \"I'm going to search for Ozma,\" remarked Dorothy, \"for she isn't in her rooms, and I want to ask her a question.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" said Scraps, \"for my eyes are brighter than yours, and they can see farther.\"  \"I'm not sure of that,\" returned Dorothy.  \"But come along, if you like.\"  Together they searched all through the great palace and even to the farthest limits of the palace grounds, which were quite extensive, but nowhere could they find a trace of Ozma.  When Dorothy returned to where Betsy and Trot awaited her, the little girl's face was rather solemn and troubled, for never before had Ozma gone away without telling her friends where she was going, or without an escort that befitted her royal state.  She was gone, however, and none had seen her go.  Dorothy had met and questioned the Scarecrow, Tik-Tok, the Shaggy Man, Button-Bright, Cap'n Bill, and even the wise and powerful Wizard of Oz, but not one of them had seen Ozma since she parted with her friends the evening before and had gone to her own rooms.  \"She didn't say anything las' night about going anywhere,\" observed little Trot.  \"No, and that's the strange part of it,\" replied Dorothy.  \"Usually Ozma lets us know of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],["title","The Lost Princess of Oz (#1)"],["body","she does.\"  \"Why not look in the Magic Picture?\" suggested Betsy Bobbin.  \"That will tell us where she is in just one second.\"  \"Of course!\" cried Dorothy.  \"Why didn't I think of that before?\"  And at once the three girls hurried away to Ozma's boudoir, where the Magic Picture always hung.  This wonderful Magic Picture was one of the royal Ozma's greatest treasures.  There was a large gold frame in the center of which was a bluish-gray canvas on which various scenes constantly appeared and disappeared.  If one who stood before it wished to see what any person anywhere in the world was doing, it was only necessary to make the wish and the scene in the Magic Picture would shift to the scene where that person was and show exactly what he or she was then engaged in doing.  So the girls knew it would be easy for them to wish to see Ozma, and from the picture they could quickly learn where she was.  Dorothy advanced to the place where the picture was usually protected by thick satin curtains and pulled the draperies aside.  Then she stared in amazement, while her two friends uttered exclamations of disappointment.  The Magic Picture was gone. Only a blank space on the wall behind the curtains showed where it had formerly hung.     CHAPTER 2  THE TROUBLES OF GLINDA THE GOOD   That same morning there was great excitement in the castle of the powerful Sorceress of Oz, Glinda the Good.  This castle, situated in the Quadling Country, far south of the Emerald City where Ozma ruled, was a splendid structure of exquisite marbles and silver grilles. Here the Sorceress lived, surrounded by a bevy of the most beautiful maidens of Oz, gathered from all the four countries of that fairyland as well as from the magnificent Emerald City itself, which stood in the place where the four countries cornered.  It was considered a great honor to be allowed to serve the good Sorceress, whose arts of magic were used only to benefit the Oz people.  Glinda was Ozma's most valued servant, for her knowledge of sorcery was wonderful, and she could accomplish almost anything that her mistress, the lovely girl Ruler of Oz, wished her to.  Of all the magical things which surrounded Glinda in her castle, there was none more marvelous than her Great Book of Records.  On the pages of this Record Book were constantly being inscribed, day by day and hour by hour, all the important events that happened anywhere in the known world, and they were inscribed in the book at exactly the moment the events happened.  Every adventure in the Land of Oz and in the big outside world, and even in places that you and I have never heard of, were recorded accurately in the Great Book, which never made a mistake and stated only the exact truth.  For that reason, nothing could be concealed from Glinda the Good, who had only to look at the pages of the Great Book of Records to know everything that had taken place. That was one reason she was such a great Sorceress, for the records made her wiser than any other living person.  This wonderful book was placed upon a big gold table that stood in the middle of Glinda's drawing room.  The legs of the table, which were incrusted with precious gems, were firmly fastened to the tiled floor, and the book itself was chained to the table and locked with six stout golden padlocks, the keys to which Glinda carried on a chain that was secured around her own neck.  The pages of the Great Book were larger in size than those of an American newspaper, and although they were exceedingly thin, there were so many of them that they made an enormous, bulky volume.  With its gold cover and gold clasps, the book was so heavy that three men could scarcely have lifted it.  Yet this morning when Glinda entered her drawing room after breakfast, the good Sorceress was amazed to discover that her Great Book of Records had mysteriously disappeared.  Advancing to the table, she found the chains had been cut with some sharp instrument, and this must have been done while all in the castle slept. Glinda was shocked and grieved.  Who could have done this wicked, bold thing?  And who could wish to deprive her of her Great Book of Records?  The Sorceress was thoughtful for a time, considering the consequences of her loss.  Then she went to her Room of Magic to prepare a charm that would tell her who had stolen the Record Book.  But when she unlocked her cupboard and threw open the doors, all of her magical instruments and rare chemical compounds had been removed from the shelves.  The Sorceress has now both angry and alarmed.  She sat down in a chair and tried to think how this extraordinary robbery could have taken place.  It was evident that the thief was some person of very great power, or the theft could not have been accomplished without her knowledge. But who, in all the Land of Oz, was powerful and skillful enough to do this awful thing?  And who, having the power, could also have an object in defying the wisest and most talented Sorceress the world has ever known?  Glinda thought over the perplexing matter for a full hour, at the end of which time she was still puzzled how to explain it.  But although her instruments and chemicals were gone, her KNOWLEDGE of magic had not been stolen, by any means, since no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire.  Glinda believed that when she had time to gather more magical herbs and elixirs and to manufacture more magical instruments, she would be able to discover who the robber was and what had become of her precious Book of Records.  \"Whoever has done this,\" she said to her maidens, \"is a very foolish person, for in time he is sure to be found out and will then be severely punished.\"  She now made a list of the things she needed and dispatched messengers to every part of Oz with instructions to obtain them and bring them to her as soon as possible.  And one of her messengers met the little Wizard of Oz, who was seated on the back of the famous live Sawhorse and was clinging to its neck with both his arms, for the Sawhorse was speeding to Glinda's castle with the velocity of the wind, bearing the news that Royal Ozma, Ruler of all the great Land of Oz, had suddenly disappeared and no one in the Emerald City knew what had become of her.  \"Also,\" said the Wizard as he stood before the astonished Sorceress, \"Ozma's Magic Picture is gone, so we cannot consult it to discover where she is.  So I came to you for assistance as soon as we realized our loss.  Let us look in the Great Book of Records.\"  \"Alas,\" returned the Sorceress sorrowfully, \"we cannot do that, for the Great Book of Records has also disappeared!\"     CHAPTER 3  THE ROBBERY OF CAYKE THE COOKIE COOK   One more important theft was reported in the Land of Oz that eventful morning, but it took place so far from either the Emerald City or the castle of Glinda the Good that none of those persons we have mentioned learned of the robbery until long afterward.  In the far southwestern corner of the Winkie Country is a broad tableland that can be reached only by climbing a steep hill, whichever side one approaches it.  On the hillside surrounding this tableland are no paths at all, but there are quantities of bramble bushes with sharp prickers on them, which prevent any of the Oz people who live down below from climbing up to see what is on top.  But on top live the Yips, and although the space they occupy is not great in extent, the wee country is all their own.  The Yips had never--up to the time this story begins--left their broad tableland to go down into the Land of Oz, nor had the Oz people ever climbed up to the country of the Yips.  Living all alone as they did, the Yips had queer ways and notions of their own and did not resemble any other people of the Land of Oz. Their houses were scattered all over the flat surface; not like a city, grouped together, but set wherever their owners' fancy dictated, with fields here, trees there, and odd little paths connecting the houses one with another.  It was here, on the morning when Ozma so strangely disappeared from the Emerald City, that Cayke the Cookie Cook discovered that her diamond-studded gold dishpan had been stolen, and she raised such a hue and cry over her loss and wailed and shrieked so loudly that many of the Yips gathered around her house to inquire what was the matter.  It was a serious thing in any part of the Land of Oz to accuse one of stealing, so when the Yips heard Cayke the Cookie Cook declare that her jeweled dishpan had been stolen, they were both humiliated and disturbed and forced Cayke to go with them to the Frogman to see what could be done about it.  I do not suppose you have ever before heard of the Frogman, for like all other dwellers on that tableland, he had never been away from it, nor had anyone come up there to see him.  The Frogman was in truth descended from the common frogs of Oz, and when he was first born he lived in a pool in the Winkie Country and was much like any other frog.  Being of an adventurous nature, however, he soon hopped out of his pool and began to travel, when a big bird came along and seized him in its beak and started to fly away with him to its nest.  When high in the air, the frog wriggled so frantically that he got loose and fell down, down, down into a small hidden pool on the tableland of the Yips.  Now that pool, it seems, was unknown to the Yips because it was surrounded by thick bushes and was not near to any dwelling, and it proved to be an enchanted pool, for the frog grew very fast and very big, feeding on the magic skosh which is found nowhere else on earth except in that one pool.  And the skosh not only made the frog very big so that when he stood on his hind legs he was as tall as any Yip in the country, but it made him unusually intelligent, so that he soon knew more than the Yips did and was able to reason and to argue very well indeed.  No one could expect a "]]]
