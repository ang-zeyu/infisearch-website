I seem to remember----\"  \"What, you remember, too? You _ought_ to consult Sayda!\"  \"I didn't mean exactly what you mean,\" I explained, humbly. \"Still, why shouldn't I have lived in Egypt long ago? The learned ones say you're always drawn back where you've been in other states of existence----\"  \"That's true, I'm sure!\"  \"Well, then, why shouldn't I have the same sort of right to Egypt you have, if you were Cleopatra?--I believe you must have been, because you look as she ought to have looked, you know. Why shouldn't I have been a friend of Marc Antony, coming from Rome to give him good advice and trying to persuade----\"  \"Oh, _not_ that he ought to give me up!\"  \"No, indeed: to urge him to leave the island where he hid even from you (didn't they call it Timoneum?). Why couldn't Antony play his cards so as to keep Cleopatra and the world, too? She'd have liked him better, wouldn't she? My friend Antoun Effendi--I mean Anthony Fenton,\"--I stopped short: for the less said about Fenton the better, at present. But Cleopatra caught me up.  \"What--have you really a friend Antony? Where does he live? and what's he like?\"  I hesitated; and glancing round for inspiration (in other words for some harmless, necessary fib) I saw that Brigit and Monny had arrived on the scene. They had been pacing the deck, arm in arm; and now, arrested by Mrs. East's question, they hovered near, awaiting my answer with vague curiosity. A twinkle in Biddy's eyes, which I caught, rattled me completely. I missed all the easiest fibs and could catch hold of nothing but the bare truth. There are moments like that, when, do what you will, you must be truthful or silent; and silence fires suspicion.  \"What is he?\" I echoed feebly. \"Oh, Captain Fenton. He's in the Gyppy Army stationed up at Khartum, hundreds of miles beyond where Cook's boats go. You wouldn't be interested in Anthony, because he spells his name with an 'H', and he's dark and thin, not a bit like _your_ Antony, who was a big, stout fellow, I've always heard, and fair.\" \"Big, but _not_ stout,\" Cleopatra corrected me. \"And--and if he's incarnated again, he may be dark for a change. As for the 'H', that's not important. I wonder if we shall meet your Anthony? We think of going to Khartum, don't we, Monny?\"  \"Yes,\" said the girl, shortly. She was always rather short in her manner at that time when in her opinion her aunt was being \"silly.\"  I gathered from a vexed flash in the gray eyes that there had never been any hint of an impending Antony.  \"Is your friend in Khartum now?\" Biddy ventured, in her creamiest voice. The twinkle was carefully turned off like the light of a dark lantern, but I knew well that \"Mrs. Jones\" was recalling a certain conversation, in which I had refused to satisfy her curiosity. Brigit's quick, Irish mind has a way of matching mental jigsaw puzzles, even when vital bits appear to be missing; and if she could make a cat's paw of Cleopatra, the witch would not be above doing it. I bore her no grudge--who could bear soft-eyed, laughing, yet tragic Biddy a grudge? --but I wished that she and Monny were at the other end of the deck.  \"I--er--really, I don't know where my friend is just now,\" I answered, with more or less foundation of truth.  \"I wonder if I didn't read in the papers about a Captain Fenton who took advantage of leave he'd got, to make a rush for the Balkans, and see the fighting from the lines of the Allies?\" Biddy murmured with dreadful intelligence. \"Can he be your Captain Fenton? I fancy he'd been stationed in the Sudan; and he was officially supposed to have gone home to spend his leave in England. Anyhow, there was a row of some sort after he and another man dropped down on to the Turks out of a Greek aeroplane. Or was it a Servian one? Anyhow, I know he oughtn't to have been in it; and 'Paterfamilias' and 'Patriot' wrote letters to the _Times_ about British officers who didn't mind their own business. Why, I saw the papers on board this ship! They were old ones. Papers on ships always are. But I think they came on at Algiers or somewhere.\"  \"Probably 'somewhere,'\" I witheringly replied. \"_I_ didn't come on at Algiers, so I don't know anything about it.\"  \"Diplomatists never do know anything official, do they, Duffer dear?\" smiled Biddy. \"I'll wager your friend is interesting, even if he does spell himself with an 'H', and weighs two stone less than his namesake from Rome. Mrs. East believes in reincarnation, and I'm not sure I don't, though Monny's so young she doesn't believe in anything. Just suppose your friend is a reincarnation of Antony without an 'H'? And suppose, too, by some strange trick of fate he should meet you in Alexandria or Cairo? You'd introduce him to us, wouldn't you?\"  \"It's the most unlikely thing in the world. And he'd be no good to you. He's a man's man. He thinks he doesn't like women.\"  \"Doesn't like women!\" echoed Monny Gilder. \"He must be a curmudgeon. Or has he been jilted?\"  \"Rather not!\" Too impulsively I defended the absent. \"Girls go mad about him. He has to keep them off with a stick. He's got other things to think of than girls, things he believes are more important--though, of course, he's mistaken. He'll find that out some day, when he has more time. So far, he's been hunting other game, often in wild places. A book might be written on his adventures.\"  \"What kind of adventures? Tell us about them,\" said Biddy, \"up to the Balkan one, which you deny having heard of.\"  \"You wouldn't care about his sort of adventures. There aren't any women in them,\" said I. \"Women want love stories. It's only the heroines they care for, not the heroes, and I don't somehow see the right heroine for Fenton's story.\"  I noticed an expression dawning on Cleopatra's face, as I thus bereft her of a possible Antony (with an \"H\"). There was a softening of the long eyes, and the glimmer of a smile which said \"Am I Cleopatra for nothing?\"  Never had she looked handsomer. Never before had I thought of her as really dangerous. I'd been inclined to poke fun at the lady for her superstition and her cartouche, and Cleopatra-hood in general. But suddenly I realized that her make-up was no more exaggerated than that of many a beauty of the stage and of society: and that nowadays, women who are--well, forty-ish--can be formidable rivals for younger and simpler sisters. Not that I feared much for Anthony from Cleopatra or any other female thing, for I'd come to consider him practically woman-proof; still, I saw danger that the lady might make a dead set at him, if she got the chance, and all through my stupidity in giving away his name. \"Antony\" was a thrilling password to that mysterious \"something\" which she expected to happen in Egypt: and already she regarded my friend as a ram caught in the bushes, for a sacrifice on her altar. Instead of screening him I had dragged him in front of the footlights. But fortunately there was still time to jerk down the curtain.  I threw a glance at Brigit and Monny, and was relieved to find that their attention was distracted by a new arrival: Miss Rachel Guest from Salem, Massachusetts: a pale, thin, lanky copy of our Rose, with the beauty and bloom left out; but a pair of eyes to redeem the colourless face--oh, yes, a pair of eyes! Strange, hungry, waiting eyes.  When I am alone, I fear Monny's favourite _protégée_, who started out to \"see the world\" on a legacy of two thousand dollars, and won Miss Gilder's admiration (and hospitality) through her unassuming pluck. To my mind she is the ideal adventuress of a new, unknown, and therefore deadly type; but for once I rejoiced at sight of the pallid, fragile woman, so cheerful in spite of frail health, so frank about her twenty-eight years. She had news to tell of a nature so exciting that, after a whisper or two, Cleopatra forgot Anthony in her desire to know the latest development in the Ship's Mystery.  \"My stewardess says he won't let his wife land till we're all off,\" murmured the ex-schoolmistress, in her colourless voice. \"She heard the end of a conversation, when she carried the poor girl's lunch to the door--just a word or two. So we shan't see her again, I suppose.\"  \"Oh, yes, we shall,\" said Monny. \"If Wretched Bey can get a private boat, so can I. I'll not desert her, if I have to stay on board the _Laconia_ the whole night.\"  All four began talking together eagerly, and blessing Miss Guest I sneaked away. Presently I saw that clever Neill Sheridan and handsome, actor-like Willis Bailey, the two _bêtes noires_ of Wretched Bey, had joined the group.  By this time the roofs and domes and minarets of Alexandria sparkled in clearly sketched outlines between sunset-sky and sea; sunset of Egypt, which divided ruby-flame of cloud, emerald dhurra, gold of desert, and sapphire waters into separate bands of colour, vivid as the stripes of a rainbow.  There was a new buzz of excitement on the decks and in the ivy draped veranda café. Those who had been studying Baedeker gabbled history, ancient and modern, until the conquest of Alexander and the bombardment of '82 became a hopeless jumble in the ears of the ignorant. Bores who had travelled inflicted advice on victims who had not. People told each other pointless anecdotes of \"the last time I was in Egypt,\" while those forced to listen did so with the air of panthers waiting to pounce. A pause for breath on the part of the enemy gave the wished-for opportunity to spring into the breach with an adventure of their own.  We took an Arab pilot on board--the first Arab ever seen by the ladies of my party--and before the red torch of sunset had burned down to dusky purple, tenders like big, black turtles were swimming out to the _Laconia_. We slaves of the Rose, however, had surrendered all personal interest in these objects. The word of Miss Gilder had gone forth, and, unless Rechid Bey changed his mind at the last minute, we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],["title","It Happened in Egypt (#5)"],["body","all to lurk in ambush until he appeared with his wife. Then, somehow, Monny was to snatch her chance for a word with the Ship's Mystery; and whatever happened, none of us were to stir until it had been snatched.  Arguments, even from Biddy, were of no avail, and mine were silenced by cold permission to go away by myself if I chose. It was terrible, it was wicked to talk of people making their own beds and then lying in them. It was nonsense to say that, even if the wife of Rechid Bey asked for help, we could do nothing. Of course, we would do something! If the girl wanted to be saved, she should be saved, if Monny had to act alone. Whatever happened, Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Bailey must remain in the background, as the very sight of them would drive \"Wretched Bey\" _wild!_  I was thinking of Anthony's surprise when one after the other, two tenders should reach the quay without me; and if the Gilded Rose had not been so sweet, her youthful cocksureness would have made me yearn to slap her. In spite of all, however, the girl's excitement became contagious as passengers crowded down the gangway and Rechid Bey did not appear.  \"Allah--Allah!\" cried the boatman and the Arab porters as they hauled huge trunks off the ship onto a float. Then one after the other the two tenders puffed away, packed from stem to stern. A few people for whom there was no room embarked in small boats manned by jabbering Arabs. Two of these cockle-shells still moved up and down under the black, mountainous side of the ship, and the officer whose duty it was to see the passengers off was visibly restless. He wanted to know if my lordship was ready; and my lordship's brain was straining after an excuse for further delay, when a man and woman arrived opportunely; Rechid Bey and a veiled, muffled form hooked to his arm; a slender, appealing little figure: and through the veil I fancied that I caught a gleam of large, wistful, anxious eyes.  The ladies were lying in wait out of sight, and I dodged behind the sturdy blue shoulders guarding the gangway. This was my first glimpse of the Ship's Mystery; and though I did not like my job (I had to surprise Rechid Bey and take his mind off his wife) my curiosity was pricked. The figure in sealskin looked very girlish; the veiled head was bowed. The mystery took on human personality for me, and Monny Gilder was no longer obstinate; she was a loyal friend. I did not see that we could be of use to the poor little fool who had married a Turk, yet I was suddenly ready to do what I could. As Rechid Bey brought his wife to the top of the gangway, I lounged out, and spoke. Disconcerted, the stout, good-looking man of thirty let drop the arm of the girl, putting her behind him. And this was what Monny wanted. They would have an instant for a few disjointed words: Monny might perhaps have time to promise help which the girl dared not ask, even behind her husband's back.  \"Good evening,\" I said in French, taking advantage of a smoke-room acquaintance. \"Is that smart boat down there for you? I was trying to secure it, in my best Arabic, but the fellow said it was engaged.\"  \"Yes, it is mine,\" Rechid answered, civilly, trying to hide his annoyance. \"I telegraphed from Naples to a friend in Alexandria to send me a private boat. I do not like crowds.\"  \"Neither do I, so I waited, too,\" I explained. \"They told me there were always boats, and my big luggage has gone. I suppose yours has, too?\"  \"No doubt,\" said Rechid Bey. \"Good night, Milord Borrow.\"  He turned quickly to his wife, as if to catch her at something, but the slim veiled mystery stood meekly awaiting his will. To my intense relief Monny and her friends were invisible. I could hardly wait until the two figures had passed out of sight down the gangway, to know whether my skirmishing attack had been successful.  \"Well?\" I asked, as Miss Gilder, \"Mrs. Jones,\" Cleopatra, Rachel Guest, and two maids filed out from concealment. \"Did I give you time enough? Did you get the chance you wanted?\"  \"Yes, thank you ever so much,\" said Monny, with one of those dazzling smiles that would make her a beauty even if she were not the favourite Sunday supplement heiress. \"I counted on you--and _she_ had counted on me. She must have known I wouldn't fail her, for she had this bit of paper ready. When I jumped out she slipped it into my hand. We didn't need to say a word, and Wretched Bey has no idea I came near her.\"  \"A bit of paper?\" I echoed, with interest. For it sounded the obvious secret thing; a bit of paper stealthily slid from hand to hand.  \"Yes, with her address on it--nothing more in writing: but two other words, pricked with a pin. '_Save me._' Don't you see, if her husband had pounced on it, no harm would have been done. He wouldn't have noticed the pin-pricks, as a woman would. I thought she was going to live in Cairo, and I believe she thought so too, at first. But she's written down the name of a house in a place called Asiut. Did you ever hear of such a town, Lord Ernest?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said I. \"The Nile boats stop there and people see tombs and mummied cats and buy silver shawls.\"  \"Good!\" said Monny. \"_My_ boat shall stop there, but not only for tombs or cats or silver shawls. I have an idea that the poor girl is frightened, and wants me to help her escape.\"  \"Great heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"You mustn't on any account get mixed up in an adventure of that sort! Remember, this is Egypt----\"  \"I don't care,\" said Monny, \"if it's the moon.\"  She believed that this settled the matter. I believed the exact opposite. But I left it at that, for the moment, as the boat was waiting, and Asiut seemed a long way off.  This was my first lesson in what Brigit called \"Monny's little ways\"; but the second lesson was on the heels of the first.     CHAPTER III  A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A DRAGOMAN   It was a blow not to see Anthony on the quay. And other blows rained thick and fast. My two consolations were that I was actually in Egypt; and that in the confusion Rechid Bey with the veiled figure of his silent bride had slipped away without further incidents. Their disappearance was regretted by no one save Monny, unless it was Neill Sheridan, and he was discreet enough to keep his feelings to himself. The girl was not. She protested on principle, although she had the Asiut address. But where all men, black and brown and white, were yelling with the whole force of their lungs, and pitching and tossing luggage (mostly the wrong luggage) with all the force of their arms, nobody heard or cared what she said. For once Monny Gilder was disregarded by a crowd of men. This could happen only at the departure of a boat train! But if I was not thinking about her, I was thinking about her fifteen trunks, and Cleopatra's sixteen and Biddy's and Miss Guest's two. The maids were worse than useless, and I had no valet. I have never had a valet. I clawed, I fought, I wrestled in an arena where it was impossible to tell the wild beasts from the martyrs. I rescued small bags from under big boxes, and dashed off with a few samples to the train, in order to secure places. All other able-bodied men, including Sheridan and the artist sculptor Bailey, were engaged in the same pursuit, and our plan was to \"bag\" a whole compartment between us in the boat-special for Cairo. But we never met again till we reached our destination. One expects Egypt to warm the heart with its weather, but the cold was bitter; so was the disappointment about Anthony. Both cut through me like knives. Darkness had fallen before I was ready to join the ladies--if I could. In passing earlier, I had shouted to the maids where to find the places, grabbed with difficulty, for their mistresses. Whether they had found them, or whether any of the party still existed, was the next question; and it was settled only as the train began to move. The compartment I had selected was boiling over with a South American president and his effects; but as I stood transfixed by this transformation scene, Cleopatra's maid hailed me from the end of the corridor. _Les quatres dames_ were in the restaurant car. Why? Ah, it was the Arab they had engaged as dragoman, who had advised the change in milord's absence. He said it would be better, as of course they would want dinner. He himself was looking after the small _baggages_, except the little sacks of the hand which the maids kept.  What, the ladies had engaged a dragoman! And they had trusted him--a stranger--with luggage? Then it was as good as gone! But no, mildly ventured Cleopatra's handmaiden. The dragoman came recommended. He had a letter from a friend of milord.  My thoughts jumped, of course, to Anthony. Yet how could he have known that I was travelling with ladies? And if by some Marconian miracle he had heard, why should he, who prided himself on \"not bothering\" with women, trouble to provide a dragoman at Alexandria?  I hurried to the dining car, and found Monny with her satellites seated at a table, three of them looking as calmly innocent as if they had not upset my well-laid scheme for their comfort. Biddy alone had a guilty air, because, perhaps, I was more important in her eyes than in the eyes of the others. \"Oh, dear Duffer,\" she began to wheedle me: \"We hope you don't mind our coming here? We thought it a good idea, for we're starving, although we're perfectly happy because we're in Egypt, and because it's such a _quaint_ train, so different and Eastern. The dragoman who----\"  \"I think he came from your friend Anthony with an 'H,'\" Cleopatra broke in. \"He seemed providential. And he speaks English. The only objection is, he's not as good-looking as Monny and I wanted our dragoman to be. We did hope to get one who would be _becoming_ to us, you see, and give the right sort of Eastern background. But I suppose one can't have _everything!_ And it was I who said your friend Anthony's messenger must be engaged even if his face is--is--rather like an _accident!_\"  \"It's like a catastrophe,\""]]]
