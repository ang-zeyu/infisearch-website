The Jews demand equal rights; when men demand equality with their masters, treason is at work, and justice sharpens her sword.  Equality! these wealthy usurers!  Sacred Virgin! they would be soon buying up our kingdoms.\"  The Dominican gazed hard on the king.  \"Son, I trust thee,\" he said, in a low voice, and glided from the tent.     CHAPTER II.  THE AMBUSH, THE STRIFE, AND THE CAPTURE.  The dawn was slowly breaking over the wide valley of Granada, as Almamen pursued his circuitous and solitary path back to the city.  He was now in a dark and entangled hollow, covered with brakes and bushes, from amidst which tall forest trees rose in frequent intervals, gloomy and breathless in the still morning air.  As, emerging from this jungle, if so it may be called, the towers of Granada gleamed upon him, a human countenance peered from the shade; and Almamen started to see two dark eyes fixed upon his own.  He halted abruptly, and put his hand on his dagger, when a low sharp whistle from the apparition before him was answered around--behind; and, ere he could draw breath, the Israelite was begirt by a group of Moors, in the garb of peasants.  \"Well, my masters,\" said Almamen, calmly, as he encountered the wild savage countenances that glared upon him, \"think you there is aught to fear from the solitary santon?\"  \"It is the magician,\" whispered one man to his neighbour--\"let him pass.\"  \"Nay,\" was the answer, \"take him before the captain; we have orders to seize upon all we meet.\"  This counsel prevailed; and gnashing his teeth with secret rage, Almamen found himself hurried along by the peasants through the thickest part of the copse.  At length, the procession stopped in a semicircular patch of rank sward, in which several head of cattle were quietly grazing, and a yet more numerous troop of peasants reclined around upon the grass.  \"Whom have we here?\" asked a voice which startled back the dark blood from Almamen's cheek; and a Moor of commanding presence rose from the midst of his brethren.  \"By the beard of the prophet, it is the false santon! What dost thou from Granada at this hour?\"  \"Noble Muza,\" returned Almamen--who, though indeed amazed that one whom he had imagined his victim was thus unaccountably become his judge, retained, at least, the semblance of composure--\"my answer is to be given only to my lord the king; it is his commands that I obey.\"  \"Thou art aware,\" said Muza, frowning, \"that thy life is forfeited without appeal?  Whatsoever inmate of Granada is found without the walls between sunrise and sunset, dies the death of a traitor and deserter.\"  \"The servants of the Alhambra are excepted,\" answered the Israelite, without changing countenance.  \"Ah!\" muttered Muza, as a painful and sudden thought seemed to cross him, \"can it be possible that the rumour of the city has truth, and that the monarch of Granada is in treaty with the foe?\" He mused a little; and then, motioning the Moors to withdraw, he continued aloud, \"Almamen, answer me truly: hast thou sought the Christian camp with any message from the king?\"  \"I have not.\"  \"Art thou without the walls on the mission of the king?\"  \"If I be so, I am a traitor to the king should I reveal his secret.\"  \"I doubt thee much, santon,\" said Muza, after a pause; \"I know thee for my enemy, and I do believe thy counsels have poisoned the king's ear against me, his people and his duties.  But no matter, thy life is spared a while; thou remainest with us, and with us shalt thou return to the king.\"  \"But, noble Muza----\"  \"I have said!  Guard the santon; mount him upon one of our chargers; he shall abide with us in our ambush.\"  While Almamen chafed in vain at his arrest, all in the Christian camp was yet still.  At length, as the sun began to lift himself above the mountains, first a murmur, and then a din, betokened warlike preparations.  Several parties of horse, under gallant and experienced leaders, formed themselves in different quarters, and departed in different ways, on expeditions of forage, or in the hope of skirmish with the straggling detachments of the enemy.  Of these, the best equipped, was conducted by the Marquess de Villena, and his gallant brother Don Alonzo de Pacheco.  In this troop, too, rode many of the best blood of Spain; for in that chivalric army, the officers vied with each other who should most eclipse the meaner soldiery in feats of personal valour; and the name of Villena drew around him the eager and ardent spirits that pined at the general inactivity of Ferdinand's politic campaign.  The sun, now high in heaven, glittered on the splendid arms and gorgeous pennons of Villena's company, as, leaving the camp behind, it entered a rich and wooded district that skirts the mountain barrier of the Vega. The brilliancy of the day, the beauty of the scene, the hope and excitement of enterprise, animated the spirits of the whole party. In these expeditions strict discipline was often abandoned, from the certainty that it could be resumed at need.  Conversation, gay and loud, interspersed at times with snatches of song, was heard amongst the soldiery; and in the nobler group that rode with Villena, there was even less of the proverbial gravity of Spaniards.  \"Now, marquess,\" said Don Estevon de Suzon, \"what wager shall be between us as to which lance this day robs Moorish beauty of the greatest number of its worshippers?\"  \"My falchion against your jennet,\" said Don Alonzo de Pacheco, taking up the challenge.  \"Agreed.  But, talking of beauty, were you in the queen's pavilion last night, noble marquess? it was enriched by a new maiden, whose strange and sudden apparition none can account for.  Her eyes would have eclipsed the fatal glance of Cava; and had I been Rodrigo, I might have lost a crown for her smile.\"  \"Ay,\" said Villena, \"I heard of her beauty; some hostage from one of the traitor Moors, with whom the king (the saints bless him!) bargains for the city.  They tell me the prince incurred the queen's grave rebuke for his attentions to the maiden.\"  \"And this morning I saw that fearful Father Tomas steal into the prince's tent.  I wish Don Juan well through the lecture.  The monk's advice is like the algarroba;--[The algarroba is a sort of leguminous plant common in Spain]--when it is laid up to dry it may be reasonably wholesome, but it is harsh and bitter enough when taken fresh.\"  At this moment one of the subaltern officers rode up to the marquess, and whispered in his ear.  \"Ha!\" said Villena, \"the Virgin be praised!  Sir knights, booty is at hand.  Silence! close the ranks.\"  With that, mounting a little eminence, and shading his eyes with his hand, the marquess surveyed the plain below; and, at some distance, he beheld a horde of Moorish peasants driving some cattle into a thick copse.  The word was hastily given, the troop dashed on, every voice was hushed, and the clatter of mail, and the sound of hoofs, alone broke the delicious silence of the noon-day landscape.  Ere they reached the copse, the peasants had disappeared within it.  The marquess marshalled his men in a semicircle round the trees, and sent on a detachment to the rear, to cut off every egress from the wood.  This done the troop dashed within.  For the first few yards the space was more open than they had anticipated: but the ground soon grew uneven, rugged, and almost precipitous, and the soil, and the interlaced trees, alike forbade any rapid motion to the horse.  Don Alonzo de Pacheco, mounted on a charger whose agile and docile limbs had been tutored to every description of warfare, and himself of light weight and incomparable horsemanship--dashed on before the rest.  The trees hid him for a moment; when suddenly, a wild yell was heard, and as it ceased uprose the solitary voice of the Spaniard, shouting, \"_Santiago, y cierra_, Espana; St. Jago, and charge, Spain!\"  Each cavalier spurred forward; when suddenly, a shower of darts and arrows rattled on their armour; and upsprung from bush and reeds, and rocky clift, a number of Moors, and with wild shouts swarmed around the Spaniards.  \"Back for your lives!\" cried Villena; \"we are beset--make for the level ground!\"  He turned-spurred from the thicket, and saw the Paynim foe emerging through the glen, line after line of man and horse; each Moor leading his slight and fiery steed by the bridle, and leaping on it as he issued from the wood into the plain.  Cased in complete mail, his visor down, his lance in its rest, Villena (accompanied by such of his knights as could disentangle themselves from the Moorish foot) charged upon the foe.  A moment of fierce shock passed: on the ground lay many a Moor, pierced through by the Christian lance; and on the other side of the foe was heard the voice of Villena--\"St. Jago to the rescue!\"  But the brave marquess stood almost alone, save his faithful chamberlain, Solier. Several of his knights were dismounted, and swarms of Moors, with lifted knives, gathered round them as they lay, searching for the joints of the armour, which might admit a mortal wound.  Gradually, one by one, many of Villena's comrades joined their leader, and now the green mantle of Don Alonzo de Pacheco was seen waving without the copse, and Villena congratulated himself on the safety of his brother.  Just at that moment, a Moorish cavalier spurred from his troop, and met Pacheco in full career.  The Moor was not clad, as was the common custom of the Paynim nobles, in the heavy Christian armour.  He wore the light flexile mail of the ancient heroes of Araby or Fez.  His turban, which was protected by chains of the finest steel interwoven with the folds, was of the most dazzling white--white, also, were his tunic and short mantle; on his left arm hung a short circular shield, in his right hand was poised a long and slender lance.  As this Moor, mounted on a charger in whose raven hue not a white hair could be detected, dashed forward against Pacheco, both Christian and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9757"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book II. (#3)"],["body"," breathed hard, and remained passive.  Either nation felt it as a sacrilege to thwart the encounter of champions so renowned.  \"God save my brave brother!\" muttered Villena, anxiously.  \"Amen,\" said those around him; for all who had ever witnessed the wildest valour in that war, trembled as they recognised the dazzling robe and coal-black charger of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.  Nor was that renowned infidel mated with an unworthy foe.  \"Pride of the tournament, and terror of the war,\" was the favourite title which the knights and ladies of Castile had bestowed on Don Alonzo de Pacheco.  When the Spaniard saw the redoubted Moor approach, he halted abruptly for a moment, and then, wheeling his horse around, took a wider circuit, to give additional impetus to his charge.  The Moor, aware of his purpose, halted also, and awaited the moment of his rush; when once more he darted forward, and the combatants met with a skill which called forth a cry of involuntary applause from the Christians themselves.  Muza received on the small surface of his shield the ponderous spear of Alonzo, while his own light lance struck upon the helmet of the Christian, and by the exactness of the aim rather than the weight of the blow, made Alonzo reel in his saddle.  The lances were thrown aside--the long broad falchion of the Christian, the curved Damascus cimiter of the Moor, gleamed in the air.  They reined their chargers opposite each other in grave and deliberate silence.  \"Yield thee, sir knight!\" at length cried the fierce Moor, \"for the motto on my cimiter declares that if thou meetest its stroke, thy days are numbered.  The sword of the believer is the Key of Heaven and Hell.\" --[Such, says Sale, is the poetical phrase of the Mohammedan divines.]  \"False Paynim,\" answered Alonzo, in a voice that rung hollow through his helmet, \"a Christian knight is the equal of a Moorish army!\"  Muza made no reply, but left the rein of his charger on his neck; the noble animal understood the signal, and with a short impatient cry rushed forward at full speed.  Alonzo met the charge with his falchion upraised, and his whole body covered with his shield; the Moor bent--the Spaniards raised a shout--Muza seemed stricken from his horse.  But the blow of the heavy falchion had not touched him: and, seemingly without an effort, the curved blade of his own cimiter, gliding by that part of his antagonist's throat where the helmet joins the cuirass, passed unresistingly and silently through the joints; and Alonzo fell at once, and without a groan, from his horse--his armour, to all appearance, unpenetrated, while the blood oozed slow and gurgling from a mortal wound.  \"Allah il Allah!\" shouted Muza, as he joined his friends; \"Lelilies! Lelilies!\" echoed the Moors; and ere the Christians recovered their dismay, they were engaged hand to hand with their ferocious and swarming foes.  It was, indeed, fearful odds; and it was a marvel to the Spaniards how the Moors had been enabled to harbour and conceal their numbers in so small a space.  Horse and foot alike beset the company of Villena, already sadly reduced; and while the infantry, with desperate and savage fierceness, thrust themselves under the very bellies of the chargers, encountering both the hoofs of the steed and the deadly lance of the rider, in the hope of finding a vulnerable place for the sharp Moorish knife,--the horsemen, avoiding the stern grapple of the Spaniard warriors, harrassed them by the shaft and lance,--now advancing, now retreating, and performing, with incredible rapidity, the evolutions of Oriental cavalry.  But the life and soul of his party was the indomitable Muza.  With a rashness which seemed to the superstitious Spaniards like the safety of a man protected by magic, he spurred his ominous black barb into the very midst of the serried phalanx which Villena endeavoured to form around him, breaking the order by his single charge, and from time to time bringing to the dust some champion of the troop by the noiseless and scarce-seen edge of his fatal cimiter.  Villena, in despair alike of fame and life, and gnawed with grief for his brother's loss, at length resolved to put the last hope of the battle on his single arm.  He gave the signal for retreat; and to protect his troop, remained himself, alone and motionless, on his horse, like a statue of iron.  Though not of large frame, he was esteemed the best swordsman, next only to Hernando del Pulgar and Gonsalvo de Cordova, in the army; practised alike in the heavy assault of the Christian warfare, and the rapid and dexterous exercise of the Moorish cavalry.  There he remained, alone and grim--a lion at bay--while his troops slowly retreated down the Vega, and their trumpets sounded loud signals of distress, and demands for succour, to such of their companions as might be within bearing.  Villena's armour defied the shafts of the Moors; and as one after one darted towards him, with whirling cimiter and momentary assault, few escaped with impunity from an eye equally quick and a weapon more than equally formidable.  Suddenly, a cloud of dust swept towards him; and Muza, a moment before at the further end of the field, came glittering through that cloud, with his white robe waving and his right arm bare.  Villena recognised him, set his teeth hard, and putting spurs to his charger, met the rush.  Muza swerved aside, just as the heavy falchion swung over his head, and by a back stroke of his own cimiter, shore through the cuirass just above the hip-joint, and the blood followed the blade.  The brave cavaliers saw the danger of their chief; three of their number darted forward, and came in time to separate the combatants.  Muza stayed not to encounter the new reinforcement; but speeding across the plain, was soon seen rallying his own scattered cavalry, and pouring them down, in one general body, upon the scanty remnant of the Spaniards.  \"Our day is come!\" said the good knight Villena, with bitter resignation. \"Nothing is left for us, my friends, but to give up our lives--an example how Spanish warriors should live and die.  May God and the Holy Mother forgive our sins and shorten our purgatory!\"  Just as he spoke, a clarion was heard at a distance and the sharpened senses of the knights caught the ring of advancing hoofs.  \"We are saved!\" cried Estevon de Suzon, rising on his stirrups.  While he spoke, the dashing stream of the Moorish horse broke over the little band; and Estevon beheld bent upon himself the dark eyes and quivering lip of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.  That noble knight had never, perhaps, till then known fear; but he felt his heart stand still, as he now stood opposed to that irresistible foe.  \"The dark fiend guides his blade!\" thought De Suzon; \"but I was shriven but yestermorn.\"  The thought restored his wonted courage; and he spurred on to meet the cimiter of the Moor.  His assault took Muza by surprise.  The Moor's horse stumbled over the ground, cumbered with the dead and slippery with blood, and his uplifted cimiter could not do more than break the force of the gigantic arm of De Suzon; as the knight's falchion bearing down the cimiter, and alighting on the turban of the Mohammedan, clove midway through its folds, arrested only by the admirable temper of the links of steel which protected it. The shock hurled the Moor to the ground.  He rolled under the saddle- girths of his antagonist.  \"Victory and St. Jago!\" cried  the  knight,  \"Muza is--\"  The sentence was left eternally unfinished.  The blade of the fallen Moor had already pierced De Suzoii's horse through a mortal but undefended part.  It fell, bearing his rider with him.  A moment, and the two champions lay together grappling in the dust; in the next, the short knife which the Moor wore in his girdle had penetrated the Christian's visor, passing through the brain.  To remount his steed, that remained at band, humbled and motionless, to appear again amongst the thickest of the fray, was a work no less rapidly accomplished than had been the slaughter of the unhappy Estevon de Suzon. But now the fortune of the day was stopped in a progress hitherto so triumphant to the Moors.  Pricking fast over the plain were seen the glittering horsemen of the Christian reinforcements; and, at the remoter distance, the royal banner of Spain, indistinctly descried through volumes of dust, denoted that Ferdinand himself was advancing to the support of his cavaliers.  The Moors, however, who had themselves received many and mysterious reinforcements, which seemed to spring up like magic from the bosom of the earth--so suddenly and unexpectedly had they emerged from copse and cleft in that mountainous and entangled neighbourhood--were not unprepared for a fresh foe.  At the command of the vigilant Muza, they drew off, fell into order, and, seizing, while yet there was time, the vantage-ground which inequalities of the soil and the shelter of the trees gave to their darts and agile horse, they presented an array which Ponce de Leon himself, who now arrived, deemed it more prudent not to assault.  While Villena, in accents almost inarticulate with rage, was urging the Marquess of Cadiz to advance, Ferdinand, surrounded by the flower of his court, arrived at the rear of the troops and after a few words interchanged with Ponce de Leon, gave the signal to retreat.  When the Moors beheld that noble soldiery slowly breaking ground, and retiring towards the camp, even Muza could not control their ardour. They rushed forward, harassing the retreat of the Christians, and delaying the battle by various skirmishes.  It was at this time that the headlong valour of Hernando del Pulgar, who had arrived with Ponce de Leon, distinguished itself in feats which yet live in the songs of Spain.  Mounted upon an immense steed, and himself of colossal strength, he was seen charging alone upon the assailants, and scattering numbers to the ground with the sweep of his enormous two- handed falchion.
