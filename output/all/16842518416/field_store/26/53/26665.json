Several coaches had been lately stopped by three highwaymen, who worked together, and were reported to be more reckless than the generality of their sort. They had shot a coachman who refused to stop, the week before on Hounslow Heath, they had killed a guard on the great north road, and they had shot two passengers who resisted, near Exeter.  Tom and Peter were greatly amused by observing that the passenger who sat next to them, and who, at the commencement of the conversation, showed a brace of heavy pistols with which he was provided, with much boasting as to what he should do if the coach were attacked, when he heard of the fate of the passengers who had resisted, became very quiet indeed, and presently took an opportunity, when he thought that he was not observed, of slipping his pistols under the tarpaulin behind him.  \"I hope those dreadful men won't stop our coach,\" Rhoda said.  \"They won't hurt you if they do, Rhoda,\" Tom said assuringly. \"I think it would be rather a lark. I say, Peter,\" he went on in a whisper, \"I think we might astonish them with those pistols that coward next to you has hid behind him.\"  \"I should just think so,\" Peter said; \"the bargee at Eton would be nothing to it.\"  The hours went slowly on. Rhoda and the boys dozed uncomfortably against each other and the baggage behind them, until they were suddenly roused by a shout in the road beside them: \"Stand for your lives!\"  The moon was up, and they could see that there were three horsemen. One galloped to the horses' heads, and seized the rein of one of the leaders, the others rode by the coach.  The first answer to the challenge was a discharge from the blunderbuss of the guard, which brought one of the highwaymen from his horse.  The other, riding up to the side of the coach, fired at the guard, and a loud cry told that the shot had taken effect. In another moment the fellow was by the side of the coachman.  \"Hold up!\" he said, \"or I will blow your brains out!\"  The coachman did as he was ordered, and indeed the man at the leader's head had almost succeeded in stopping them. The passenger next to the boys had, at the first challenge, again seized his pistols, and the boys thought that he was going to fire after all.  \"Lie down at our feet, Rhoda, quick!\" Tom said, \"and don't move till I tell you.\" The fate of the guard evidently frightened away the short-lived courage of the passenger, for, as the coachman again pulled up, he hastily thrust the pistols in behind him.  \"Get down, every one of you,\" the highwayman shouted.  \"Lie still, Rhoda,\" Tom whispered. \"Now, Peter, get in underneath the tarpaulin.\"  This was done as the passengers descended. The luggage was not so heavily piled as usual, and the boys found plenty of room beneath the tarpaulin.  \"Now, Peter, you take one of these pistols and give me the other. Now peep out. The moon is hidden, which is a good thing; now, look here, you shall shoot that fellow standing down below, who is swearing at the ladies inside for not getting out quicker. I'll take a shot at that fellow standing in front of the horse's heads.\"  \"Do you think you can hit him, Tom?\"  \"I have not the least idea, but I can try; and if you hit the other one, the chances are he'll bolt, whether I hit him or not. Open the tarpaulin at the side so as to see well, and rest the pistol upon something. You must take a good shot, Peter, for if you miss him we shall be in a mess.\"  \"All right,\" Peter said, in a whisper, \"I can almost touch him with the pistol.\"  In loud and brutal tones the highwayman now began to order the frightened ladies to give up their watches and rings, enforcing his commands with terrible curses. When suddenly a pistol flashed out just behind him, and he fell off his horse with a ball through his shoulder.  Tom's shot, though equally well intended, was not so truly aimed. The highwayman had dismounted, and was standing just in front of the leaders, so that Tom had a fair view of him between them. The boys had both occasionally fired their father's pistols, for, in those days, each householder in the country always kept loaded pistols in his room, but his skill was not sufficient to make sure of a man at that distance. The bullet flew past at two feet to the left of his head. But its effect was scarcely less startling than if it had actually hit him, for, in its passage, it passed through the ear of the off leader. The horse made a start at the sudden pain, and then dashed forward. The rest of the team, already alarmed by the shot, followed her lead; before the startled highwayman could get out of the way they were upon him, in another instant he was under their heels, and the coach gave a sudden lurch as it passed over his body.  \"Lie still, Rhoda, a little longer; it's all right, but the horses have run away,\" Tom exclaimed, as he scrambled forward, and caught hold of the reins, which the coachman had tied to the rail of the seat as he got down. \"Catch hold of the reins, Peter, and help me pull.\"  Peter did so; but the united strength of the boys was wholly unequal to arresting the headlong flight of the horses.  Fortunately the highwaymen had chosen a low bottom between two hills, to arrest the coach, consequently the road was up a hill of moderate steepness. The boys hoped that the horses would stop when they got to the top; but they went on with redoubled speed.  \"This is something like going it,\" Peter said.  \"Isn't it, Peter? They know their way, and we ain't lively to meet anything in the road. They will stop at their stable. At any rate, it's no use trying to steer them. Here, Rhoda dear, get up; are you very much frightened?\"  Rhoda still lay quite still, and Peter, holding on with difficulty, for the coach quite rocked with the speed at which they were going, climbed over to her, and stooped, down. \"Shall I help you up, Rhoda?\"  \"No, please, I would rather stop here till it's all over.\"  Fortunately the hill, up to the Tillage where they made the change, was a steep one, and the horses broke into a trot before they reached the top, and, in another minute drew up at the door of the inn. The astonishment of the ostlers at seeing the horses covered with lather, and coachbox tenanted only by two boys, behind whom a little white face now peered out, was extreme, and they were unable to get beyond an ejaculation of hallo! expressive of a depth of incredulous astonishment impossible to be rendered by words.  \"Look here,\" Tom said, with all the composure, and much of the impudence, which then, as now, characterized the young Etonian, \"don't be staring like a pack of stuck pigs. You had better get the fresh horses in, and drive back to the bottom, about four miles from here. There has been regular row with some fellows, and I expect two or three are killed. Now, just put up the ladder; I want to get my sister down.\"  Almost mechanically the men put the ladder up to the coach, and the boys and Rhoda got down.  \"Do you say the coach has been attacked by highwaymen in Burnet bottom?\"  \"I don't know anything about Burnet bottom,\" Tom said. \"It was a bottom about four miles off. There were three of them. The guard shot one of them, and the others shot the guard. Then we were stopped by them, and every one had to get down. Then the horses ran away, and here we are.\"  \"Then there are two of those highwayman chaps with the passengers,\" one of the men said.  \"You need not be afraid of them,\" Tom said carelessly; \"one got shot, and I don't know about the other, but the wheel of the coach went over him, so I do not suppose he will be much trouble. Now, if I were you, I should not stand staring any more, but should make haste and take the coach back.\"  \"Hullo, look at this grey,\" one of the men exclaimed, as, at last understanding what had taken place, they began to bustle about to change horses. \"He's got blood all over the side of his head. One of those scoundrels has shot him through the ear.\"  Tom burst out laughing. \"I am the scoundrel!\" he said. \"Peter, that explains why we went off so suddenly. I missed the fellow, and hit the leader in the ear. However, it comes to the same thing. By the way, we may as well take the pistols.\"  So saying, he ran up the ladder and brought down the pistols. By this time the fresh horses were in.  \"I can't make nought of it,\" one of the ostlers said, climbing up into the coachman's seat. \"Jump up, Bill and Harry. It's the rummiest go I ever heard of in coaching.\"  \"Landlady, can you get us some tea at once, please,\" Tom said, going up to the landlady, who was looking on from the door of the house with an astonishment equal to that of the men at the whole affair; \"as quickly as you can, for my sister looks regularly done up with fatigue, and then, please let her lie down till the coach is ready to start again. It will be three quarters of an hour before it is back, and then, I daresay, there will be a lot of talking before they go on. I should think they will be wanting breakfast. At any rate, an hour's rest will do you good, Rhoda.\"  Rhoda was too worn out with the over-excitement even to answer. Fortunately there was hot water in order to make hot grog for the outriders of the coach, some tea was quickly made, and in ten minutes Rhoda was fast asleep on the landlady's bed.  Tom and Peter expressed their desire for something substantial in the way of eating, for the morning had now fairly broken. The landlady brought in some cold meat, upon which the boys made a vigorous attack, and then, taking possession of two benches, they dozed off until the coach arrived.  It had but three horses, for one had been sent off to carry Bill, the ostler, at full speed to the town at which they had last changed horses, to fetch a doctor and the constable. The other two men had remained with the guard, who was shot in the hip, and the highwayman, whose collar-bone was broken by Peter's shot. The fellow shot by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9613"],["title","The Young Buglers (#3)"],["body",", and the other one, whom the coach wheels had passed over, were both dead.  \"There's the coach, Tom.\"  \"What a nuisance, Peter, they'll all be wanting to talk now, and I am just so comfortably off. Well, I suppose it's no use trying to get any more sleep.\"  So saying, they roused themselves, and went out to the door just as the coach drew up.  There was a general shout of greeting from the passengers, which was stopped, however, by a peremptory order from the coachman.  He was a large, stout man, with a face red from the effects of wind and exposure. \"Jack,\" he said, to a man who was standing near, for the news of the attack upon the coach had quickly spread, and all the villagers were astir to see it come in. \"Jack, hold the leader's head. Thomas, open the door, and let the insides out. Gents,\" he said solemnly, when this was done, \"I'm going to do what isn't a usual thing by no means, in fact, I ain't no precedence for doing it; but then, I do not know any precedence for this here business altogether. I never did hear of a coachman standing up on his box to give a cheer, no, not to King George himself; but, then, King George never polished off two highwaymen all to himself, leastway, not as I've heard tell of. Now, these two young gents have done this. They have saved my coach and my passengers from getting robbed, and so I'm going to give 'em three cheers. I'll trouble you to help me up into the box seat, gentlemen.\"  Assisted by the other passengers, the driver now gravely climbed up into the box seat, steadied himself there by placing one hand upon the shoulder of the passenger next him, took off his low-crowned hat, and said. \"Follow me, gents, with three cheers for those young gents standing there; better plucked ones I never came across, and I've traveled a good many miles in my day.\"  So saying, he gave three stentorian cheers, which were echoed by all the passengers and villagers.  Then there was a momentary silence, and Tom, who, with his brother, had been feeling very uncomfortable, although rather inclined to laugh, seeing that he was expected to say something, said, \"Thank you all very much; but we'd much rather you hadn't done it.\"  Then there was a general laugh and movement, and a general pressing forward of the passengers to shake the boys by the hand. The driver was assisted down from his elevated position, and got off the coach and came up to them. \"That's the first speech I ever made, young gentlemen, and, if I know myself, it will be the last; but, you see, I was druv to it. You're a good sort, that's certain. What will you drink?\"  The boys declared for beer, and drank solemnly with the driver, imitating him in finishing their mugs at a draught, and turning them topsy-turvy. There was now a great deal of talking, and many questions were asked. Tom and Peter modestly said that there was really nothing to tell. They saw that the gentleman next to them intended to use his pistols; but, not seeing a good opportunity, put them down behind the tarpaulin, and the thought occurred to them that, by slipping behind it, they would get a good chance of a certain shot. Accordingly, they had fired, and then the horse had run away; and there was an end of it. There was nothing extraordinary in the whole matter.  \"At any rate, my boys, you have saved me from a loss of a couple of hundred pounds which I had got hid in my boots, but which those fellows would have been sure to have have discovered,\" one of the passengers said.  There was a general chorus of satisfaction at many watches and trinkets saved, and then the first passenger went on,--  \"I propose, gentlemen and ladies, that when we get to the end of our journey we make a subscription, according to the amount we have saved, and that we get each of these young gentlemen a brace of the very best pistols that can be bought. If they go on as they have begun, they will find them useful.\"  There was a general exclamation of approval, and one of the ladies, who had been an inside passenger, said, \"And I think we ought to give a handsome ring to their sister as a memorial through life. Of course, she had not so much to do as her brothers, but she had the courage to keep still, and she had to run the risk, both of being shot, and of being upset by the coach just as they did.\"  This also was unanimously approved, and, after doing full justice to the breakfast set before them, the party again took their places. Rhoda being carried down asleep, by the landlady, and placed in the coach, one of the inside passengers getting out to make room for her, and she was laid, curled up, on the seat, with her head in a lady's lap, and slept quietly, until, to her astonishment, she was woke up, and told that she was in Marlborough.     CHAPTER II.  TWO YOUNG PICKLES.   An old-fashioned open carriage, drawn by a stiff, old-fashioned horse, and driven by a stiff, old-fashioned man, was in waiting at the inn at which the coach drew up at Marlborough. Into this the young Scudamores were soon transferred, and, after a hearty good-bye from their fellow-passengers, and an impressive one from the coachman, they started upon the concluding part of their journey.  \"How far is it to aunt's?\" Tom asked.  \"About six miles, young sir,\" the driver said gravely.  The young Scudamores had great difficulty to restrain their laughter at Tom's new title; in fact, Peter nearly choked himself in his desperate efforts to do so, and no further questions were asked for some time.  The ride was a pleasant one, and Rhoda, who had never been out of Lincolnshire before, was delighted with the beautiful country through which they were passing. The journey, long as it was--for the road was a very bad one, and the horse had no idea of going beyond a slow trot--passed quickly to them all; but they were glad when the driver pointed to a quaint old-fashioned house standing back from the road, and said that they were home.  \"There are the pigeons, Rhoda, and there is Minnie asleep on that open window-sill.\"  Very many times had the young Scudamores talked about their aunt, and had pictured to themselves what she would be like; and their ideas of her so nearly approached the truth, that she almost seemed to be an old acquaintance as she came to the door as the carriage stopped. She was a tall, upright, elderly lady, with a kind, but very decided face, and a certain prim look about her manner and dress.  \"Well, niece Rhoda and nephews, I am glad to see that you have arrived safely,\" she said in a clear, distinct voice. \"Welcome to the Yews. I hope that we shall get on very well together. Joseph, I hope that you have not driven Daisy too fast, and that you did not allow my nephews to use the whip. You know I gave you very distinct instructions not to let them do so.\"  \"No, my lady, they never so much as asked.\"  \"That is right,\" Miss Scudamore said, turning round and shaking hands with the boys, who had now got out of the carriage and had helped Rhoda down. \"I am glad to hear what Joseph tells me, for I know that boys are generally fond of furious driving and like lashing horses until they put them into a gallop. And now, how are you, niece Rhoda! Give me a kiss. That is right. You look pale and tired, child; you must have something to eat, and then go to bed. Girls can't stand racketing about as boys can. You look quiet and nice, child, and I have no doubt we shall suit very well. It is very creditable to you that you have not been spoilt by your brothers. Boys generally make their sisters almost as noisy and rude as they are themselves.\"  \"I don't think we are noisy and rude, aunt,\" Tom said, with a smile.  \"Oh, you don't, nephew?\" Miss Scudamore said, looking at him sharply, and then shaking her head decidedly two or three times. \"If your looks do not belie you both sadly, you are about as hair-brained a couple of lads as my worst enemies could wish to see sent to plague me; but,\" she added to herself, as she turned to lead the way indoors, \"I must do my duty, and must make allowances; boys will be boys, boys will be boys, so they say at least, though why they should be is more than I can make out. Now, Rhoda, I will take you up with me. Your bedroom leads out of mine, dear. Hester,\" she said to a prim-looking servant who had come out after her to the door; \"will you show my nephews to their room? Dinner will be ready at two; it is just a quarter to the hour now. I see that you have got watches, so that you will be able to be punctual; and I must request you, when you have done washing, not to throw the water out of the window, because my flower-beds are underneath.\"  Tom had great difficulty in keeping his countenance, while he assured his aunt that his brother and himself never did empty their basins out of the window.  \"That is right,\" Miss Scudamore said doubtfully; \"but I have heard that boys do such things.\"  Once fairly in their room and the door shut, the boys had a great laugh over their aunt's ideas as to boys.  \"There is one comfort,\" Tom said at last; \"whatever we do we shall never surprise her.\"  \"I think we shall get on very well with her,\" Peter said. \"She means to be kind, I am sure. This is a jolly room, Tom.\"  It was a low wainscoted room, with a very wide window divided into three by mullions, and fitted with latticed panes. They were open, and a delicious scent of flowers came in from the garden. The furniture was all new and very strong, of dark stained wood, which harmonized well with the paneling. There were no window curtains, but a valance of white dimity hung above the window. There was a piece of carpet between the beds; the rest of the floor was bare, but the boards were of old oak, and looked as well without it. Several rows of pegs had been put upon the walls, and there was a small chest of drawers by each bed.  \"This is very jolly, Peter; but it is a pity that there are bars to the window.\"  When they came down to dinner they found that Rhoda, quite done up with her journey,"]]]
