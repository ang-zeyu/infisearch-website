To soothe his conscience--for he was wholly destitute of one--he received Robert into the factory, and the boy's wages, as we already know, constituted their main support.  Such was the state of things at the commencement of our story.  When the superintendent reached home in the evening, he was at once assailed by his wife and son, who gave a highly colored account of the insult which Halbert had received from Robert Rushton.  \"Did he have any reason for striking you, Halbert?\" asked the superintendent.  \"No,\" answered Halbert, unblushingly. \"He's an impudent young scoundrel, and puts on as many airs as if he were a prince instead of a beggar.\"  \"He is not a beggar.\"  \"He is a low factory boy, and that is about the same.\"  \"By no means. He earns his living by honest industry.\"  \"It appears to me,\" put in Mrs. Davis, \"that you are taking the part of this boy who has insulted your son in such an outrageous manner.\"  \"How am I doing it? I am only saying he is not a beggar.\"  \"He is far below Halbert in position, and that is the principal thing.\"  It occurred to the superintendent that should he make restitution Robert Rushton would be quite as well off as his own son, but of course he could not venture to breathe a hint of this to his wife. It was the secret knowledge of the deep wrong which he had done to the Rushtons that now made him unwilling to oppress him further.  \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"you are making too much of this matter. It is only a boyish quarrel.\"  \"A boyish quarrel!\" retorted Mrs. Davis, indignantly. \"You have a singular way of standing by your son, Mr. Davis. A low fellow insults and abuses him, and you exert yourself to mate excuses for him.\"  \"You misapprehend me, my dear.\"  \"Don't 'my dear' me,\" said the exasperated lady. \"I thought you would be as angry as I am, but you seem to take the whole thing very coolly, upon my word!\"  Mrs. Davis had a sharp temper and a sharp tongue, and her husband stood considerably in awe of both. He had more than once been compelled to yield to them, and he saw that he must make some concession to order to keep the peace.  \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" he asked.  \"Want you to do! I should think that was plain enough.\"  \"I will send for the boy and reprimand him.\"  \"Reprimand him!\" repeated the lady, contemptuously. \"And what do you think he will care for that?\"  \"More than you think, perhaps.\"  \"Stuff and nonsense! He'll be insulting Halbert again to-morrow.\"  \"I am not so sure that Halbert is not in fault in some way.\"  \"Of course, you are ready to side with a stranger against your own son.\"  \"What do you want me to do?\" asked the superintendent, submissively.  \"Discharge the boy from your employment,\" said his wife, promptly.  \"But how can he and his mother live?--they depend on his wages.\"  \"That is their affair. He ought to have thought of that before he raised his hand against Halbert.\"  \"I cannot do what you wish,\" said the superintendent, with some firmness, for he felt that it would indeed be a piece of meanness to eject from the factory the boy whom he had already so deeply wronged; \"but I will send for young Rushton and require him to apologize to Halbert.\"  \"And if he won't do it?\" demanded Halbert.  \"Then I will send him away.\"  \"Will you promise that, father?\" asked Halbert, eagerly.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Davis, rather reluctantly.  \"All right!\" thought Halbert; \"I am satisfied; for I know he never will consent to apologize.\"  Halbert had good reason for this opinion, knowing, as he did, that he had struck the first blow, a circumstance he had carefully concealed from his father. Under the circumstances he knew very well that his father would be called upon to redeem his promise.  The next morning, at the regular hour, our hero went to the factory, and taking his usual place, set to work. An hour passed, and nothing was said to him. He began to think that Halbert, feeling that he was the aggressor, had resolved to let the matter drop.  But he was speedily undeceived.  At a quarter after eight the superintendent made his appearance, and after a brief inspection of the work, retired to his private office. Ten minutes later, the foreman of the room in which he was employed came up to Robert and touched him on the shoulder.  \"Mr. Davis wishes to see you in his office,\" he said.  \"Now for it!\" thought Robert, as he left his work and made his way, through the deafening clamor of the machinery, to the superintendent's room.     CHAPTER V.   DISCHARGED.  The superintendent sat at an office table writing a letter. He did not at first look up, but kept on with his employment. He had some remnants of conscience left, and he shrank from the task his wife had thrust upon him.  \"Mr. Baker tells me you wish to see me, Mr. Davis,\" said Robert, who had advanced into the office, by way of calling his attention.  \"Yes,\" said the superintendent, laying down his pen, and turning half round; \"I hear a bad account of you, Rushton.\"  \"In what way, sir?\" asked our hero, returning his look fearlessly.  \"I hear that you have been behaving like a young ruffian,\" said Mr. Davis, who felt that he must make out a strong case to justify him in dismissing Robert from the factory.  \"This is a serious charge, Mr. Davis,\" said Robert, gravely, \"and I hope you will be kind enough to let me know what I have done, and the name of my accuser.\"  \"I mean to do so. Probably it will be enough to say that your accuser is my son, Halbert.\"  \"I supposed so. I had a difficulty with Halbert yesterday, but I consider he was in fault.\"  \"He says you insulted and struck him.\"  \"I did not insult him. The insult came from him.\"  \"Did you strike him?\"  \"Yes, but not until he had struck me first.\"  \"He didn't mention this, but even if he had you should not have struck him back.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Robert.  \"You should have reported the affair to me.\"  \"And allowed him to keep on striking me?\"  \"You must have said something to provoke him,\" continued the superintendent, finding it a little difficult to answer this question, \"or he would not have done it.\"  \"If you will allow me,\" said Robert, \"I will give you an account of the whole affair.\"  \"Go on,\" said the superintendent, rather unwillingly, for he strongly suspected that our hero would be able to justify himself, and so render dismissal more difficult.  \"Halbert took offense because I accompanied Hester Paine home from the writing school, evening before last, though I did with the young lady's permission, as he knew. He met me yesterday at twelve o'clock, as I was going home to dinner, and undertook to lecture me on my presumption in offering my escort to one so much above me. He also taunted me with being a factory boy. I told him to keep his advice to himself, as I should not ask his permission when I wanted to walk, with Hester Paine. Then he became enraged, and struck me with his cane. I took it from him and returned the blow, breaking the cane in doing it.\"  \"Ahem!\" said the superintendent, clearing his throat; \"you must have been very violent.\"  \"I don't think I was, sir. I struck him a smart blow, but the cane was very light and easily broken.\"  \"You were certainly very violent,\" continued Mr. Davis, resolved to make a point of this. \"Halbert did not break the cane when he struck you.\"  \"He struck the first blow.\"  \"That does not alter the question of the amount of violence, which was evidently without justification. You must have been in a great passion.\"  \"I don't think I was in any greater passion than Halbert.\"  \"In view of the violence you made use of, I consider that you owe my son an apology.\"  \"An apology!\" repeated Robert, whose astonishment was apparent in his tone.  \"I believe I spoke plainly,\" said the superintendent, irritably.  \"If any apology is to be made,\" said our hero, firmly, \"it ought to come from Halbert to me.\"  \"How do you make that out?\"  \"He gave me some impertinent advice, and, because I did not care to take it, he struck me.\"  \"And you seized his cane in a fury, and broke it in returning the blow.\"  \"I acknowledge that I broke the cane,\" said Robert; \"and I suppose it is only right that I should pay for it. I am willing to do that, but not to apologize.\"  \"That will not be sufficient,\" said the superintendent, who knew that payment for the cane would fall far short of satisfying his wife or Halbert. \"The cost of the cane was a trifle, and I am willing to buy him another, but I cannot consent that my son should be subjected to such rude violence, without an apology from the offender. If I passed this over, you might attack him again to-morrow.\"  \"I am not in the habit of attacking others without cause,\" said Robert, proudly. \"If Halbert will let me alone, or treat me with civility, he may be sure that I shall not trouble him.\"  \"You are evading the main point, Rushton,\" said the superintendent. \"I have required you to apologize to my son, and I ask you for the last time whether you propose to comply with my wishes.\"  \"No, sir,\" said Robert, boldly.  \"Do you know to whom you are speaking, boy?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am not only the father of the boy you have assaulted, but I am also the superintendent of this factory, and your employer.\".  \"I am aware of that, sir.\"  \"I can discharge you from the factory.\"  \"I know you can,\" said Robert.  \"Of course, I should be sorry to resort to such an extreme measure, but, if you defy my authority, I may be compelled to do so.\"  So the crisis had come. Robert saw that he must choose between losing his place and a humiliating apology. Between the two he did not for a moment hesitate.  \"Mr. Davis,\" he said, boldly and firmly, \"it will be a serious thing for me if I lose my place here, for my mother and I are poor, and my wages make the greatest part of our income. But I cannot make this apology you require. I will sooner lose my place.\"  The bold and manly bearing of our hero, and his resolute tone, impressed the superintendent with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#4)"],["body","involuntary admiration. He felt that Robert was a boy to be proud of, but none the less he meant to carry out his purpose.  \"Is this your final decision?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then you are discharged from the factory. You will report your discharge to Mr. Baker, and he will pay you what you have earned this week.\"  \"Very well, sir.\"  Robert left the office, with a bold bearing, but a heart full of trouble. If only himself had been involved in the calamity, he could have borne it better, but he knew that his loss of place meant privation and want for his mother, unless he could find something to do that would bring in an equal income, and this he did not expect.  \"Mr. Baker,\" he said, addressing the foreman of his room, on his return from the superintendent's office, \"I am discharged.\"  \"Discharged?\" repeated the foreman, in surprise. \"There must be some mistake about this. You are one of our best hands--for your age, I mean.\"  \"There is no dissatisfaction with my work that I know of, but I got into a quarrel with Halbert Davis yesterday, and his father wants me to apologize to him.\"  \"Which you won't do?\"  \"I would if I felt that I were in fault. I am not too proud for that. But the fact is, Halbert ought to apologize to me.\"  \"Halbert is a mean boy. I don't blame you in the least.\"  \"So I am to report my discharge to you, and ask you for my wages.\"  This account was soon settled, and Robert left the factory his own master. But it is poor consolation to be one's own master under such circumstances. He dreaded to break the news to his mother, for he knew that it would distress her. He was slowly walking along, when he once more encountered Halbert Davis. Halbert was out for the express purpose of meeting and exulting over him, for he rightly concluded that Robert would decline to apologize to him. Robert saw his enemy, and guessed his object, but resolved to say nothing to him, unless actually obliged to do so.  \"Where are you going?\" demanded Halbert.  \"Home.\"  \"I thought you worked in the factory?\"  \"Did you?\" asked Robert, looking full in his face, and reading the exultation he did not attempt to conceal.  \"Perhaps you have got turned out?\" suggested Halbert, with a malicious smile.  \"You would be glad of that, I suppose,\" said our hero.  \"I don't think I should cry much,\" said Halbert. \"It's true then, is it?\"  \"Yes; it's true.\"  \"You won't put on so many airs when you go round begging for cold victuals. It'll be some time before you walk with Hester Paine again.\"  \"I shall probably walk with her sooner than you will.\"  \"She won't notice a beggar.\"  \"There is not much chance of my becoming a beggar, Halbert Davis; but I would rather be one than be as mean as you. I will drop you a slight hint, which you had better bear in mind. It won't be any safer to insult me now than it was yesterday. I can't lose my place a second time.\"  Halbert instinctively moved aside, while our hero passed on, without taking farther notice of him.  \"I hate him!\" he muttered to himself. \"I hope he won't find anything to do. If he wasn't so strong, I'd give him a thrashing.\"     CHAPTER VI.   HALBERT'S DISCOMFITURE.  Great was the dismay of Mrs. Rushton when she heard from Robert that he was discharged from the factory. She was a timid woman, and rather apt to take desponding views of the future.  \"Oh, Robert, what is going to become of us?\" she exclaimed, nervously. \"We have only ten dollars in the house, and you know how little I can earn by braiding straw. I really think you were too hasty and impetuous.\"  \"Don't be alarmed, my dear mother,\" said Robert, soothingly. \"I am sorry I have lost my place, but there are other things I can do besides working in the factory. We are not going to starve yet.\"  \"But, suppose you can't find any work?\" said his mother.  \"Then I'll help you braid straw,\" said Robert, laughing. \"Don't you think I might learn after a while?\"  \"I don't know but you might,\" said Mrs. Rushton, dubiously; \"but the pay is very poor.\"  \"That's so, mother. I shan't, take to braiding straw except as a last resort.\"  \"Wouldn't Mr. Davis take you back into the factory if I went to him and told him how much we needed the money?\"  \"Don't think of such a thing, mother,\" said Robert, hastily, his brown cheek flushing. \"I am too proud to beg to be taken back.\"  \"But it wouldn't be you.\"  \"I would sooner ask myself than have you do it, mother. No; the superintendent sent me away for no good reason, and he must come and ask me to return before I'll do it.\"  \"I am afraid you are proud, Robert.\"  \"So I am, mother; but it is an honest pride. Have faith in me for a week, mother, and see if I don't earn something in that time. I don't expect to make as much as I earned at the factory; but I'll earn something, you may depend upon that. Now, how would you like to have some fish for supper?\"  \"I think I should like it. It is a good while since we had any.\"  \"Then, I'll tell you what--I'll borrow Will Paine's boat, if he'll let me have it, and see if I can't catch something.\"  \"When will you be home, Robert?\"  \"It will depend on my success in fishing. It'll be half-past nine, very likely, before I get fairly started, so I think I'd better take my dinner with me. I'll be home some time in the afternoon.\"  \"I hope you'll be careful, Robert. You might get upset.\"  \"I'll take care of that, mother. Besides, I can swim like a duck.\"  Robert went out into the garden, and dug some worms for bait. Meanwhile, his mother made a couple of sandwiches, and wrapped them in a paper for his lunch. Provided thus, he walked quickly to the house of Squire Paine, and rang the bell.  \"Is Will home?\" he asked.  \"Here I am, old fellow!\" was heard from the head of the stairs; and William Paine, a boy of our hero's size and age, appeared. \"Come right up.\"  \"How did you happen to be at leisure?\" he asked. \"I supposed you were at the factory.\"  \"I'm turned off.\"  \"Turned off! How's that?\"  \"Through the influence of Halbert Davis.\"  \"Halbert is a disgusting sneak. I always despised him, and, if he's done such a mean thing, I'll never speak to him again. Tell me all about it.\"  This Robert did, necessarily bringing in Hester's name.  \"He needn't think my sister will walk with him,\" said Will. \"If she does, I'll cut her off with a shilling. She'd rather walk with you, any day.\"  Robert blushed a little; for, though he was too young to be in love, he thought his friend's sister the most attractive girl he had even seen, and, knowing how she was regarded in the village, he naturally felt proud of her preference for himself over a boy who was much richer.  \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Will, with interest.  \"The first thing I am going to do is to catch some fish, if you'll lend me your boat.\"  \"Lend you my boat? Of course I will! I'll lend it to you for the next three months.\"  \"But you want it yourself?\"  \"No. Haven't you heard the news? I'm going to boarding school.\"  \"You are?\"  \"It's a fact. I'm packing my trunk now. Come upstairs, and superintend the operation.\"  \"I can't stay long. But, Will, are you in earnest about the boat?\"  \"To be sure I am. I was meaning to ask you if you'd take care of it for me. You see, I can't carry it with me, and you are the only fellow I am willing to lend it to.\"  \"I shall be very glad of the chance, Will. I've been wanting a boat for a long time, but there wasn't much chance of my getting one. Now I shall feel rich. But isn't this a sudden idea, your going to school?\"  \"Rather. There was a college classmate of father's here last week, who's at the head of such a school, and he made father promise to send me. So I'm to start to-morrow morning. If it wasn't for that, and being up to my ears in getting ready, I'd go out fishing with you.\"  \"I wish you could.\"  \"I must wait till vacation. Here is the boat key.\"  Robert took the key with satisfaction. The boat owned by his friend was a stanch, round-bottomed boat, of considerable size, bought only two months before, quite the best boat on the river. It was to be at his free disposal, and this was nearly the same thing as owning it. He might find it very useful, for it occurred to him that, if he could find nothing better to do, he could catch fish every day, and sell at the village store such as his mother could not use. In this way he would be earning something, and it would be better than being idle.  He knew where the boat was usually kept, just at the foot of a large tree, whose branches drooped over the river. He made his way thither, and, fitting the key in the padlock which confined the boat, soon set it free. The oars he had brought with him from his friend's house.  Throwing in the oars, he jumped in, and began to push off, when he heard himself called, and, looking up, saw Halbert Davis standing on the bank.  \"Get out of that boat!\" said Halbert.  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Robert.  \"You have no business in that boat! It doesn't belong to you!\"  \"You'd better mind your own business, Halbert Davis. You have nothing to do with the boat.\"  \"It's William Paine's boat.\"  \"Thank you for the information. I supposed it was yours, from the interest you seem to take in it.\"  \"It will be. He's going to let me have it while he's away at school.\"  \"Indeed! Did he tell you so?\"  \"I haven't asked Ma yet; but I know he will let me have it.\"  \"I don't think he will.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"If you ever want to borrow this boat, you'll have to apply to me.\"  \"You haven't bought it?\" asked Halbert, in surprise. \"You're too poor.\"  \"I'm to have charge of the boat while Will Paine is away.\"  \"Did he say you might?\" asked Halbert, in a tone of disappointment and mortification.  \"Of course he did.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said Halbert, suspiciously.  \"I don't care what you believe. Go and ask him yourself, if you are not satisfied; and don't meddle with what is none of your business;\"  \"You're an impudent rascal.\"  \"Have you got another cane you'd like to have broken?\" asked Robert,"]]]
