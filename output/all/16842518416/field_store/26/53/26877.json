They had sails, but   were driven forward mostly by their oars. The trireme, or ordinary   war-ship, had its oars arranged in three banks, fifty men rowing at   once. After these had rowed several hours, or a \"watch,\" another fifty   took their places, and finally a third fifty, so that the ships could be   rowed at high speed all the time. With the aid of its two sails a   trireme is said to have gone one hundred and fifty miles in a day and a   night. These boats were about one hundred and twenty feet long and   fifteen feet wide. They could be rowed in shallow water, but were not   high enough to ride heavy seas safely. They had a sharp beak, which,   driven against an enemy's ship, would break in its sides. The Greek   grain ships and freight boats were heavier and more capable of enduring   rough weather.    [Illustration: ALEXANDER THE GREAT After the bust in the   Capitoline Museum, Rome]  ALEXANDER THE GREAT, KING OF MACEDON FROM 336 TO 323 B.C. Greek   ways of living were also carried eastward as well as westward. The   enlargement of the Greek world in this direction was due to Alexander   the Great, the most skilful soldier and the ablest leader of men among   all the Greeks. Alexander was king of Macedon, and like the earlier   Greeks he regarded the Persians as his enemies, and made war upon them.   After conquering the Persians he marched across western Asia until he   had reached the Indus River in India. He was a builder of cities as well   as a conqueror. He founded seventy cities, and sixteen of them were   named for him. The most important was the Alexandria which is still the   chief seaport of Egypt. Greek became the language commonly spoken   throughout the lands near the eastern Mediterranean. This is the reason   why in later times the New Testament was written in Greek.  ALEXANDRIA. Of this Greek world Athens ceased to be the center and   Alexandria took its place. At Alexandria there was a great library which   contained over five hundred thousand volumes or rolls. There also was   the museum or university, in which many learned men were at work. The   best known of these men was Euclid, who perfected the mathematics which   we call geometry, and Ptolemy, whose ideas about geography and the shape   and size of the globe Columbus carefully studied before he set out on   his great voyage. Alexandria was also a center of trade and commerce.   From Alexandria, because its ships were the first foreign ships to be   admitted to a Roman port, the Romans gained their liking for many of the   beautiful things which the Greeks made.

CHAPTER V   NEW RIVALS OF THE GREEKS  THE GREEK COLONIES AND THE CARTHAGINIANS. The Greek colonies were   sometimes in danger of being attacked by the native tribes whose lands   they had seized or by the wilder tribes that dwelt further from the   coast. In Sicily their most dangerous neighbors were the Carthaginians   at the western end of the island. The chief town of these people was   Carthage, situated opposite Sicily in northern Africa in what is now   Tunis. The Carthaginians were emigrants from Tyre and other cities of   Phoenicia on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, and because of   their many ships held control of a large part of the western   Mediterranean. They had colonies even in Spain, where in very early   times Phoenician traders had gone to obtain gold and silver.  THE GREEKS AND THE ROMANS. In Italy the most dangerous neighbors of   the Greek colonists were the Romans, who lived half-way up the western   side of the peninsula along the river Tiber. The history of the Romans,   like the history of the Greeks, is full of interesting and wonderful   tales. Some of them are legends, such as every people likes to tell   about its early history. They relate how the city was founded by two   brothers, Romulus and Remus; how Horatius defended the bridge across the   Tiber against the hosts of the exiled Tarquin king; how the farmer   Cincinnatus, having been made leader or dictator, in sixteen days drove   off the neighboring tribes which were attacking the Romans and then went   back to his plough.  THE GAULS BURN ROME, 390 B.C. The Romans told stories of their   defeats as well as of their victories. One of these tells how hosts of   Gauls, a people of the same race as the forefathers of the French,   streamed southward from the valley of the Po. The Romans were alarmed by   such tall men, with fierce eyes, and fair, flowing hair, whose swords   crashed through the frail Roman helmets. They sent a large army to stop   the invaders, but in the battle, which was fought only twelve miles from   Rome, this army was destroyed.    The few defenders that were left withdrew to the Capitoline, the   steepest of the hills over which the city had spread. Some of the older   senators and several priests scorned to seek a refuge from the fury of   the barbarians, and took their seats quietly in ivory chairs in the   market place or Forum at the foot of the Capitoline hill. The Gauls at   first gazed in wonder at the strange sight of the motionless figures.   When one of them attempted to stroke the white beard of a senator, the   senator struck him with his staff; then the Gauls fell upon senators and   priests and slew them.    [Illustration: CLIFF OF THE CAPITOLINE HILL]    The sides of the Capitoline hill were so steep that for a long time the   Gauls were baffled in their attempts to seize it. At last they   discovered a path, and one dark night were on the point of scaling the   height when some geese, sacred to the goddess Juno, cackled and flapped   their wings until the garrison was aroused and the Gauls hurled headlong   down the precipice. The garrison was saved, but the city was burned.   This happened in Rome just one hundred years after the battle of   Marathon in Greece.  THE CAUDINE FORKS. Another adventure did not have so happy an   ending. The Romans were at war with the Samnites, a tribe living on the   slopes of the Apennines, who were continually attacking the Greek cities   on the coast. The war was caused by the attempt of the Romans to protect   one of the Greek cities. The Roman generals, with a large army, in   making their way into the Samnite country attempted to march through a   narrow gorge which broadened out into a plain and then was closed again   at the farther end by another gorge. When they reached this second gorge   they found the road blocked by fallen trees and heaps of stones. They   also saw Samnites on the heights above them. In alarm they hastened to   retrace their steps, only to find the other entrance closed in the same   way. After vain attempts to force a passage or to scale the surrounding   heights they were obliged to surrender.    [Illustration: THE REGION OF THE CAUDINE FORKS]    [Illustration: ITALY BEFORE THE GROWTH OF ROMAN POWER]    The Samnites compelled the Roman army, both generals and soldiers, each   clad in a single garment, to pass \"under the yoke\" made of two spears   set upright with one laid across, while they stood by and jeered. If any   Roman looked angry or sullen at his disgrace, they struck or even killed   him. This was called the disaster of the Caudine Forks, from the pass   where the Romans were caught.  THE ROMANS AND THE GREEK CITIES. Not many years after this the   Romans quarreled with the Greek cities of southern Italy. The Greeks of   Tarentum, situated where Taranto is now, called to their aid Pyrrhus,   who ruled a part of Alexander's old kingdom. Pyrrhus was a skilful   general, and he had with him, besides his foot-soldiers and horsemen,   many trained elephants. A charge of these elephants was too much for the   Romans, who were already hard pressed by the long spears of the soldiers   of Pyrrhus. But the Romans were ready for another battle, and in this   they fought so stubbornly and killed so many of the Greek soldiers that   Pyrrhus cried out, \"Another victory like this and we are ruined.\" In a   third battle, which took place 275 B.C., he was defeated, and returned   to Greece, leaving"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],["title","Introductory American History (#6)"],["body","Romans masters of the Greek cities in Italy.  THE ROMANS CONQUERORS OF ITALY. By this time there were few tribes   south of the river Po which did not own the Romans as their masters. All   Italy was united under their rule. This was the first step in the   conquest of the world that lay about the Mediterranean Sea and in the   extension of that ancient world to the shores of the Atlantic and to   England. Before we read the story of the other conquests we must inquire   who the Roman people were and how they lived.  HOW THE ROMANS LIVED. In early times most of the Romans were   farmers or cattle raisers. A man's wealth was reckoned according to the   number of cattle he owned. Their manner of living was simple and frugal.   Like the Greek, the Roman had his games. He enjoyed chariot-races, but   used slaves or freedmen as drivers. He also went to the theater,   although he thought it unworthy of a Roman to be an actor. Such an   occupation was for foreigners or slaves.    [Illustration: A ROMAN WEARING A TOGA]  ROMAN BOYS AT SCHOOL. The boys at school did not learn poems, as   did the Greek boys, but studied the first set of laws made by the   Romans, called the Twelve Tables. This they read, copied, and learned by   heart. Their interest in laws was the first sign that they were to   become the world's greatest lawmakers.  ROMAN WOMEN. In their respect for women the Romans were superior to   the Greeks. The Roman mother did not remain in the women's apartments of   the house, as she was expected to do at Athens, but was her husband's   companion, received his guests, directed her household, and went in and   out as she chose.  PATRICIANS AND PLEBEIANS. The men of the families which first ruled   Rome were called patricians or nobles, while the rest were plebeians or   common people. There were also many slaves, but they had no rights. At   first only the patricians knew exactly what the laws were, because the   laws were not written in a book. When disputes arose between patricians   and plebeians about property, the plebeians believed the patricians   changed the laws in order to gain an advantage over their poorer   neighbors.    The story is told that twice the plebeians withdrew from the city and   refused to return until their wrongs were removed. Then they compelled   the nobles to draw up the laws in a roll called the Twelve Tables. At   this time messengers were sent to Athens to examine the laws of the   Greeks. The richer plebeians were also gradually admitted to all the   offices of the Roman republic, and so became nobles themselves.  GOVERNMENT AT ROME. The Romans had once been ruled by kings, but   now their chief officers were consuls. Two consuls were chosen each year   because the Romans feared that a single consul might make himself a   king, or, at least, gain too much power. The real rulers of Rome,   however, were the senators, the men who had held the prominent offices.   There were assemblies of the people, but these generally did what the   senators or other officers told them to do.    Among the interesting officers of Rome was the censor, who drew up a   list or census of the citizens and of their property. Another officer   was the tribune, chosen in the beginning by the plebeians to protect   them against the patricians. The tribune was not at first a member of   the senate, but he was given a seat outside the door, and if a law was   proposed that would injure the plebeians, he cried out, \"Veto,\" which   means \"I forbid,\" and the law had to be dropped. This is the origin of   our word \"veto.\"  HOW THE ROMANS TREATED THE ITALIANS. The Romans were wise in their   dealings with the cities or tribes which they conquered. They not only   sent out colonies of their fellow-citizens to occupy a part of the lands   they had seized, but they also gave the conquered peoples a share in   their government, and in some cases allowed them to act as citizens of   Rome. These new Roman citizens helped the older Romans in their wars   with other tribes. In this way Roman towns gradually spread over Italy.

The conquest of Italy by the Romans took about two   hundred and fifty years. The conquest of the peoples living in the   other lands on the shores of the Mediterranean took nearly as long   again. Only twice in these four or five hundred years was Rome in   serious danger of destruction. Once it was by the Gauls, as we have   read, who captured all the city except the citadel. The second time it   was by the Carthaginians, who lived on the northern coast of Africa.   The Romans were finally victorious over all their enemies because they   were patient and courageous in misfortune and refused to believe that   they could be conquered.  CAUSE OF WAR WITH CARTHAGE. The Carthaginians were angry at the way   the Romans treated them. They watched with alarm the steady growth of   the Roman power, and feared that the Romans, if masters of Italy,   would attack their trade with the cities of the western Mediterranean.   A quarrel broke out over a city in Sicily. At first the Carthaginians   seemed to have the best of it, because they had a strong war fleet   while the Romans had only a few small vessels. But the Romans   hurriedly built ships and placed upon each a kind of drawbridge,   fitted with great hooks called grappling-irons. These they let down   upon the enemy's decks as soon as the ships came close enough, and   over these drawbridges the Roman soldiers rushed and captured the   Carthaginian ships.    When the Carthaginians asked for peace, the Romans demanded a great   sum of money and a promise that the Carthaginians would leave the   cities in Sicily which they occupied. Soon afterward the Romans took   advantage of a mutiny in the Carthaginian army to demand more money   and to seize Sardinia and Corsica. No wonder the Carthaginians were   angry. The result was a new and more terrible war.  HANNIBAL. The Carthaginians in the new war were led by Hannibal, who   understood how to fight battles better than any of the generals whom   the Romans sent against him. The story is told that when he was a boy   his father made him promise, at the altar of his city's gods, undying   hatred to Rome. Even the Romans thought him a wonderful man. Their   historians said that toil did not wear out his body or exhaust his   energy. Cold or heat were alike to him. He never ate or drank more   than he needed. He slept when he had time, whether it was day or   night, wrapping himself in a military cloak and lying on the ground in   the midst of his soldiers. He did not dress better than the other   officers, but his weapons and his horses were the best in the army.  WAR CARRIED INTO ITALY, 218 B.C. Hannibal decided that the war should   be carried into Italy to the very gates of Rome. He started from   Spain, half of which the Carthaginians ruled, marched across southern   Gaul, and came to the foot-hills of the Alps. To climb the Alps was   the most difficult part of his long journey.  CROSSING THE ALPS. There were no roads across the mountains, only   rough paths used by the mountaineers, who constantly attacked   Hannibal's soldiers, bursting out suddenly upon them from behind a   turn in the trail, or rolling huge rocks upon them from above. The   elephants, the horses, and the baggage animals of the army were   frightened, and in the tumult many of them slipped over the precipices   and were dashed on the rocks below. For five days the army toiled   upward, and then rested two days on the summit of the pass.    [Illustration: THE ALPS THAT HANNIBAL HAD TO CROSS]    Although the road down into Italy was short, it was steep, and the   paths were slippery with ice and with snow trodden into slush by   thousands of men and animals. In one place there had been a landslide,   and the road along the rocky slope was cut away for a thousand feet.   In order to build a new road it was necessary to crack the rocks. This   the soldiers did by making huge fires and pouring wine over the heated   surface. At last, worn out, ragged, and half starved, the army reached   the plains of Italy, but with a loss of half its men.  HOW HANNIBAL WON A VICTORY. The first great battle with the Romans was   fought on the river Trebia in northern Italy, and in it Hannibal   showed how easily he could outwit and destroy a Roman army. It"]]]
