From the spot where they stood, his Highness and his attendant heard the tumult and the heavy tramp of the crowd on the staircase of the Town-hall. The noise thereupon sounded through the windows of the hall, on the balcony of which Mynheers Bowelt and D’Asperen had presented themselves. These two gentlemen had retired into the building, very likely from fear of being forced over the balustrade by the pressure of the crowd.  After this, fluctuating shadows in tumultuous confusion were seen flitting to and fro across the windows: the council hall was filling.  Suddenly the noise subsided, and as suddenly again it rose with redoubled intensity, and at last reached such a pitch that the old building shook to the very roof.  At length, the living stream poured back through the galleries and stairs to the arched gateway, from which it was seen issuing like waters from a spout.  At the head of the first group, man was flying rather than running, his face hideously distorted with satanic glee: this man was the surgeon Tyckelaer.  “We have it! we have it!” he cried, brandishing a paper in the air.  “They have got the order!” muttered the officer in amazement.  “Well, then,” his Highness quietly remarked, “now I know what to believe with regard to Mynheer Bowelt’s honesty and courage: he has neither the one nor the other.”  Then, looking with a steady glance after the crowd which was rushing along before him, he continued,--  “Let us now go to the Buytenhof, Captain; I expect we shall see a very strange sight there.”  The officer bowed, and, without making any reply, followed in the steps of his master.  There was an immense crowd in the square and about the neighbourhood of the prison. But the dragoons of Tilly still kept it in check with the same success and with the same firmness.  It was not long before the Count heard the increasing din of the approaching multitude, the first ranks of which rushed on with the rapidity of a cataract.  At the same time he observed the paper, which was waving above the surface of clenched fists and glittering arms.  “Halloa!” he said, rising in his stirrups, and touching his lieutenant with the knob of his sword; “I really believe those rascals have got the order.”  “Dastardly ruffians they are,” cried the lieutenant.  It was indeed the order, which the burgher guard received with a roar of triumph. They immediately sallied forth, with lowered arms and fierce shouts, to meet Count Tilly’s dragoons.  But the Count was not the man to allow them to approach within an inconvenient distance.  “Stop!” he cried, “stop, and keep off from my horse, or I shall give the word of command to advance.”  “Here is the order!” a hundred insolent voices answered at once.  He took it in amazement, cast a rapid glance on it, and said quite aloud,--  “Those who have signed this order are the real murderers of Cornelius de Witt. I would rather have my two hands cut off than have written one single letter of this infamous order.”  And, pushing back with the hilt of his sword the man who wanted to take it from him, he added,--  “Wait a minute, papers like this are of importance, and are to be kept.”  Saying this, he folded up the document, and carefully put it in the pocket of his coat.  Then, turning round towards his troop, he gave the word of command,--  “Tilly’s dragoons, wheel to the right!”  After this, he added, in an undertone, yet loud enough for his words to be not altogether lost to those about him,--  “And now, ye butchers, do your work!”  A savage yell, in which all the keen hatred and ferocious triumph rife in the precincts of the prison simultaneously burst forth, and accompanied the departure of the dragoons, as they were quietly filing off.  The Count tarried behind, facing to the last the infuriated populace, which advanced at the same rate as the Count retired.  John de Witt, therefore, had by no means exaggerated the danger, when, assisting his brother in getting up, he hurried his departure. Cornelius, leaning on the arm of the Ex-Grand Pensionary, descended the stairs which led to the courtyard. At the bottom of the staircase he found little Rosa, trembling all over.  “Oh, Mynheer John,” she said, “what a misfortune!”  “What is it, my child?” asked De Witt.  “They say that they are gone to the Town-hall to fetch the order for Tilly’s horse to withdraw.”  “You do not say so!” replied John. “Indeed, my dear child, if the dragoons are off, we shall be in a very sad plight.”  “I have some advice to give you,” Rosa said, trembling even more violently than before.  “Well, let us hear what you have to say, my child. Why should not God speak by your mouth?”  “Now, then, Mynheer John, if I were in your place, I should not go out through the main street.”  “And why so, as the dragoons of Tilly are still at their post?”  “Yes, but their order, as long as it is not revoked, enjoins them to stop before the prison.”  “Undoubtedly.”  “Have you got an order for them to accompany you out of the town?”  “We have not?”  “Well, then, in the very moment when you have passed the ranks of the dragoons you will fall into the hands of the people.”  “But the burgher guard?”  “Alas! the burgher guard are the most enraged of all.”  “What are we to do, then?”  “If I were in your place, Mynheer John,” the young girl timidly continued, “I should leave by the postern, which leads into a deserted by-lane, whilst all the people are waiting in the High Street to see you come out by the principal entrance. From there I should try to reach the gate by which you intend to leave the town.”  “But my brother is not able to walk,” said John.  “I shall try,” Cornelius said, with an expression of most sublime fortitude.  “But have you not got your carriage?” asked the girl.  “The carriage is down near the great entrance.”  “Not so,” she replied. “I considered your coachman to be a faithful man, and I told him to wait for you at the postern.”  The two brothers looked first at each other, and then at Rosa, with a glance full of the most tender gratitude.  “The question is now,” said the Grand Pensionary, “whether Gryphus will open this door for us.”  “Indeed, he will do no such thing,” said Rosa.  “Well, and how then?”  “I have foreseen his refusal, and just now whilst he was talking from the window of the porter’s lodge with a dragoon, I took away the key from his bunch.”  “And you have got it?”  “Here it is, Mynheer John.”  “My child,” said Cornelius, “I have nothing to give you in exchange for the service you are rendering us but the Bible which you will find in my room; it is the last gift of an honest man; I hope it will bring you good luck.”  “I thank you, Master Cornelius, it shall never leave me,” replied Rosa.  And then, with a sigh, she said to herself, “What a pity that I do not know how to read!”  “The shouts and cries are growing louder and louder,” said John; “there is not a moment to be lost.”  “Come along, gentlemen,” said the girl, who now led the two brothers through an inner lobby to the back of the prison. Guided by her, they descended a staircase of about a dozen steps; traversed a small courtyard, which was surrounded by castellated walls; and, the arched door having been opened for them by Rosa, they emerged into a lonely street where their carriage was ready to receive them.  “Quick, quick, my masters! do you hear them?” cried the coachman, in a deadly fright.  Yet, after having made Cornelius get into the carriage first, the Grand Pensionary turned round towards the girl, to whom he said,--  “Good-bye, my child! words could never express our gratitude. God will reward you for having saved the lives of two men.”  Rosa took the hand which John de Witt proffered to her, and kissed it with every show of respect.  “Go! for Heaven’s sake, go!” she said; “it seems they are going to force the gate.”  John de Witt hastily got in, sat himself down by the side of his brother, and, fastening the apron of the carriage, called out to the coachman,--  “To the Tol-Hek!”  The Tol-Hek was the iron gate leading to the harbor of Schevening, in which a small vessel was waiting for the two brothers.  The carriage drove off with the fugitives at the full speed of a pair of spirited Flemish horses. Rosa followed them with her eyes until they turned the corner of the street, upon which, closing the door after her, she went back and threw the key into a cell.  The noise which had made Rosa suppose that the people were forcing the prison door was indeed owing to the mob battering against it after the square had been left by the military.  Solid as the gate was, and although Gryphus, to do him justice, stoutly enough refused to open it, yet evidently it could not resist much longer, and the jailer, growing very pale, put to himself the question whether it would not be better to open the door than to allow it to be forced, when he felt some one gently pulling his coat.  He turned round and saw Rosa.  “Do you hear these madmen?” he said.  “I hear them so well, my father, that in your place----”  “You would open the door?”  “No, I should allow it to be forced.”  “But they will kill me!”  “Yes, if they see you.”  “How shall they not see me?”  “Hide yourself.”  “Wh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],["title","The Black Tulip (#5)"],["body","ere?”  “In the secret dungeon.”  “But you, my child?”  “I shall get into it with you. We shall lock the door and when they have left the prison, we shall again come forth from our hiding place.”  “Zounds, you are right, there!” cried Gryphus; “it’s surprising how much sense there is in such a little head!”  Then, as the gate began to give way amidst the triumphant shouts of the mob, she opened a little trap-door, and said,--  “Come along, come along, father.”  “But our prisoners?”  “God will watch over them, and I shall watch over you.”  Gryphus followed his daughter, and the trap-door closed over his head, just as the broken gate gave admittance to the populace.  The dungeon where Rosa had induced her father to hide himself, and where for the present we must leave the two, offered to them a perfectly safe retreat, being known only to those in power, who used to place there important prisoners of state, to guard against a rescue or a revolt.  The people rushed into the prison, with the cry--  “Death to the traitors! To the gallows with Cornelius de Witt! Death! death!”     Chapter 4. The Murderers   The young man with his hat slouched over his eyes, still leaning on the arm of the officer, and still wiping from time to time his brow with his handkerchief, was watching in a corner of the Buytenhof, in the shade of the overhanging weather-board of a closed shop, the doings of the infuriated mob, a spectacle which seemed to draw near its catastrophe.  “Indeed,” said he to the officer, “indeed, I think you were right, Van Deken; the order which the deputies have signed is truly the death-warrant of Master Cornelius. Do you hear these people? They certainly bear a sad grudge to the two De Witts.”  “In truth,” replied the officer, “I never heard such shouts.”  “They seem to have found out the cell of the man. Look, look! is not that the window of the cell where Cornelius was locked up?”  A man had seized with both hands and was shaking the iron bars of the window in the room which Cornelius had left only ten minutes before.  “Halloa, halloa!” the man called out, “he is gone.”  “How is that? gone?” asked those of the mob who had not been able to get into the prison, crowded as it was with the mass of intruders.  “Gone, gone,” repeated the man in a rage, “the bird has flown.”  “What does this man say?” asked his Highness, growing quite pale.  “Oh, Monseigneur, he says a thing which would be very fortunate if it should turn out true!”  “Certainly it would be fortunate if it were true,” said the young man; “unfortunately it cannot be true.”  “However, look!” said the officer.  And indeed, some more faces, furious and contorted with rage, showed themselves at the windows, crying,--  “Escaped, gone, they have helped them off!”  And the people in the street repeated, with fearful imprecations,--  “Escaped! gone! After them, and catch them!”  “Monseigneur, it seems that Mynheer Cornelius has really escaped,” said the officer.  “Yes, from prison, perhaps, but not from the town; you will see, Van Deken, that the poor fellow will find the gate closed against him which he hoped to find open.”  “Has an order been given to close the town gates, Monseigneur?”  “No,--at least I do not think so; who could have given such an order?”  “Indeed, but what makes your Highness suppose?”  “There are fatalities,” Monseigneur replied, in an offhand manner; “and the greatest men have sometimes fallen victims to such fatalities.”  At these words the officer felt his blood run cold, as somehow or other he was convinced that the prisoner was lost.  At this moment the roar of the multitude broke forth like thunder, for it was now quite certain that Cornelius de Witt was no longer in the prison.    Cornelius and John, after driving along the pond, had taken the main street, which leads to the Tol-Hek, giving directions to the coachman to slacken his pace, in order not to excite any suspicion.  But when, on having proceeded half-way down that street, the man felt that he had left the prison and death behind, and before him there was life and liberty, he neglected every precaution, and set his horses off at a gallop.  All at once he stopped.  “What is the matter?” asked John, putting his head out of the coach window.  “Oh, my masters!” cried the coachman, “it is----”  Terror choked the voice of the honest fellow.  “Well, say what you have to say!” urged the Grand Pensionary.  “The gate is closed, that’s what it is.”  “How is this? It is not usual to close the gate by day.”  “Just look!”  John de Witt leaned out of the window, and indeed saw that the man was right.  “Never mind, but drive on,” said John, “I have with me the order for the commutation of the punishment, the gate-keeper will let us through.”  The carriage moved along, but it was evident that the driver was no longer urging his horses with the same degree of confidence.  Moreover, as John de Witt put his head out of the carriage window, he was seen and recognized by a brewer, who, being behind his companions, was just shutting his door in all haste to join them at the Buytenhof. He uttered a cry of surprise, and ran after two other men before him, whom he overtook about a hundred yards farther on, and told them what he had seen. The three men then stopped, looking after the carriage, being however not yet quite sure as to whom it contained.  The carriage in the meanwhile arrived at the Tol-Hek.  “Open!” cried the coachman.  “Open!” echoed the gatekeeper, from the threshold of his lodge; “it’s all very well to say ‘Open!’ but what am I to do it with?”  “With the key, to be sure!” said the coachman.  “With the key! Oh, yes! but if you have not got it?”  “How is that? Have not you got the key?” asked the coachman.  “No, I haven’t.”  “What has become of it?”  “Well, they have taken it from me.”  “Who?”  “Some one, I dare say, who had a mind that no one should leave the town.”  “My good man,” said the Grand Pensionary, putting out his head from the window, and risking all for gaining all; “my good man, it is for me, John de Witt, and for my brother Cornelius, who I am taking away into exile.”  “Oh, Mynheer de Witt! I am indeed very much grieved,” said the gatekeeper, rushing towards the carriage; “but, upon my sacred word, the key has been taken from me.”  “When?”  “This morning.”  “By whom?”  “By a pale and thin young man, of about twenty-two.”  “And wherefore did you give it up to him?”  “Because he showed me an order, signed and sealed.”  “By whom?”  “By the gentlemen of the Town-hall.”  “Well, then,” said Cornelius calmly, “our doom seems to be fixed.”  “Do you know whether the same precaution has been taken at the other gates?”  “I do not.”  “Now then,” said John to the coachman, “God commands man to do all that is in his power to preserve his life; go, and drive to another gate.”  And whilst the servant was turning round the vehicle the Grand Pensionary said to the gatekeeper,--  “Take our thanks for your good intentions; the will must count for the deed; you had the will to save us, and that, in the eyes of the Lord, is as if you had succeeded in doing so.”  “Alas!” said the gatekeeper, “do you see down there?”  “Drive at a gallop through that group,” John called out to the coachman, “and take the street on the left; it is our only chance.”  The group which John alluded to had, for its nucleus, those three men whom we left looking after the carriage, and who, in the meanwhile, had been joined by seven or eight others.  These new-comers evidently meant mischief with regard to the carriage.  When they saw the horses galloping down upon them, they placed themselves across the street, brandishing cudgels in their hands, and calling out,--  “Stop! stop!”  The coachman, on his side, lashed his horses into increased speed, until the coach and the men encountered.  The brothers De Witt, enclosed within the body of the carriage, were not able to see anything; but they felt a severe shock, occasioned by the rearing of the horses. The whole vehicle for a moment shook and stopped; but immediately after, passing over something round and elastic, which seemed to be the body of a prostrate man set off again amidst a volley of the fiercest oaths.  “Alas!” said Cornelius, “I am afraid we have hurt some one.”  “Gallop! gallop!” called John.  But, notwithstanding this order, the coachman suddenly came to a stop.  “Now, then, what is the matter again?” asked John.  “Look there!” said the coachman.  John looked. The whole mass of the populace from the Buytenhof appeared at the extremity of the street along which the carriage was to proceed, and its stream moved roaring and rapid, as if lashed on by a hurricane.  “Stop and get off,” said John to the coachman; “it is useless to go any farther; we are lost!”  “Here they are! here they are!” five hundred voices were crying at the same time.  “Yes, here they are, the traitors, the murderers, the assassins!”  answered the men who were running after the carriage to the people who were coming to meet it. The former carried in their arms the bruised body of one of their companions, who, trying to seize the reins of the horses, had been trodden down by them.  This was the object over which the two brothers had felt their carriage pass.  The coachman stopped, but, however strongly his master urged him, he refused to get off and save himself.  In an instant the carriage was hemmed in between those who followed and those who met it. It rose above the mass of moving heads like a floating island. But in another instant it came to a dead stop. A blacksmith had with his hammer struck down one of the horses, which fell in the traces.  At this moment, the shutter of a window opened, and disclosed the sallow face and the dark eyes of the young man, who with intense interest watched the scene which was preparing. Behind him appeared the head of the officer, almost as pale as himself.  “Good heavens, Monseigneur, what is going on there?” whispered the officer.  “Something very "]]]
