The price was Freya, and I shall take her home with me.\"  \"Oh, that was only in jest,\" said Wotan. \"I could not think of letting Freya go. But I shall pay you well for the castle. I shall give you something else that will be just as good for you.\"  Fafner grew very angry and screamed:--  \"Cease your foolish talk. I built your beautiful stone palace. I drudged and toiled and heaped the massive rocks. Each stone lies firm and solid in its place, and I will have my pay!\"  \"But, surely,\" said Wotan, \"you did not think I meant to give you Freya? 'T is she who feeds us golden apples. No one but Freya knows how to make them grow. If it were not for her fresh fruits my family would grow old. They would wither like the autumn flowers.\"  \"Yes,\" raged Fafner; \"I know it is fair Freya's golden apples that keep you young. But now Freya belongs to me. Nothing else will I have.\"  Just then Wotan saw his brother, Loki, coming over the mountain.  \"Wait, Fafner! Wait until I can talk with my brother about this!\"   LOKI  \"Loki, why are you so late?\" complained Wotan, when Loki came.  Loki was much excited.  \"The Rhine-daughters are in great trouble, Wotan. As I was coming by the river I heard them weeping and wailing. Black Alberich has stolen their gold, and I promised them that I would tell you about it. Perhaps you could help them.\"  \"I have no time for the Rhine-daughters now,\" said Wotan. \"I have trouble of my own. Tell me how I can save poor Freya!\"  For many years Fafner had heard of this lump of gold. So he listened to all that Loki told. Then he asked: \"Why does Alberich want the gold?\"  \"Because,\" replied Loki, \"the gold can be made into a magic ring; if the one who would make the ring will forever give up all love, the magic ring will make its owner master of the whole wide world. Alberich declared that love was nothing to him if he could have all the gold he wanted.\"  To himself Fafner thought: \"Perhaps it would be better for me to have the gold than to have Freya and her golden apples.\" Then aloud he said: \"Let me tell you what I am willing to do, Wotan. If you will get that gold for me, I will accept it in place of Freya.\"  \"You rascal!\" roared Wotan. \"How can I give you gold that is not mine?\"  \"Very well,\" said Fafner. \"I did not come here to quarrel. Already I have waited too long. I shall take my pay. Come, Freya, you must go with me.\"  Poor, frightened Freya wept and cried aloud as Fafner picked her up and carried her off over the mountain.  He called back to Wotan and Loki: \"I will keep Freya until evening. Then I shall come again, and if you have that glittering Rhine-gold for me, then you may have your sister. If you do not give me the gold, then Freya is mine and I will keep her always.\"   YOUTH OR AGE?  As soon as Freya was gone, the flowers began to droop their heads.  Wotan and his family began to grow old and gray.  It seemed to Wotan like some awful dream.  Suddenly Loki cried out: \"We have not eaten Freya's fruit to-day! Now she is gone, we shall all wither and die!\"  Wotan had stood gazing at the ground, trying hard to think what he could do to save himself and his family.  \"Come, Loki,\" he said. \"We must go to the deep dark kingdom of the Nibelungs. I must have the gold! Let us go by way of the brimstone gorge. I cannot go by way of the river. I do not want to hear the wailing of the Rhine-daughters.\"  Wotan called back to his anxious family: \"Only wait till evening and I promise I shall bring your lost youth back to you.\"   NIBELHEIM    \"Far, far below the ground are gloomy depths,--   A mighty cavern, rocky, dark and vast.\"  It was as dark as night down in the kingdom of the Nibelungs, except for the light which flared from the smoking torches, or glowed in the coals upon the anvils.  The family of dwarfs were skilled blacksmiths and metal-workers.  From every little niche and corner came the sound of clinking anvils. Before Alberich stole the gold, the Nibelungs often sang as they worked.  They sometimes made pretty ornaments for their wives to wear or toys for their little children.  But now Alberich had made the ring of gold which bound them to do his will.  He had no love in his heart, so he drove and scolded all the time.  He made them work, work, work, both day and night, and all that they made belonged to him.  So Alberich was daily becoming mightier than ever.   THE BEST SMITH IN NIBELHEIM  Mimi, who was Alberich's brother, was the best smith in all this swarm of black slaves.  Alberich forced Mimi to make for him a strange wishing-cap.  It was made of woven steel.  Mimi had to make it just as Alberich said, but Mimi did not know how it was to be used. When it was finished, Mimi feared it had some wonderful power, and he did not want Alberich to have it.  He wished he might keep it for himself.  He had worked hard to make it.  \"Give me that helmet,\" said Alberich. \"I want you to know, Mimi, that everything in this cave belongs to me!\"  Mimi had to give it up.  Alberich put it on his head. \"Now I shall see what magic there is in this wishing-cap. Come, Night and Darkness!\" he called. \"Make me so no one can see me!\"  In an instant he was gone, and there was only a cloud of smoke where he had stood.  \"Now, Mimi!\" he called, \"look sharp! Can you see me?\"  \"No,\" gasped Mimi. \"I cannot see you at all.\"  The cloud of smoke moved down the gloomy cave and Alberich's cruel voice laughed: \"Ha! ha! Now I shall make you black slaves work! Now you dare not be idle, for when you do not see me I shall be watching you!\"  His voice sank deeper. \"Now I will make you dig, dig, dig, to the very depths of the earth to bring me gold!\"  Mimi was so frightened.  When the cloud of smoke had gone out of sight, he lay down upon the rocks and cried.   THE MASTER  Wotan and Loki swung themselves over the ledge and slid down into the murky cave where Alberich lived.  Wotan looked around and said:--  \"So this is the Kingdom of the Nibelungs! What an awful place it is!\"  From far down the passages came the sound of hundreds of slaves melting and welding precious metals for their master.  \"Loki,\" said Wotan, \"I believe it is always dark and gloomy where there is no love. What is that strange cry I hear?\"  \"Ho, Mimi, is that you?\" said Loki.  \"Leave me alone!\" cried Mimi.  \"Then tell me what you are crying about?\"  \"Oh,\" replied Mimi, \"that wretched Alberich, with his ring of gold, has made us all his slaves! With it he drives us down into the earth to dig more gold. What we get is all his. We slave for him both day and night.  \"This curse of gold has filled our cavern with despair. Lately he made me forge a wishing-cap for him. With it he makes himself so none can see him. Now we slaves can never rest. _Sh! sh!_ He is coming now!\"  Wotan and Loki, peering through the darkness, could see him now and then as he passed under the light of a flaring torch.  He was driving a swarm of bent black slaves who were carrying great packs of gold and silver and precious ore upon their backs.  The helmet was hanging at his waist.  In his hand he was swinging a whip and the giants could hear him yelling:--  \"Pile up the gold! Hurry! Hurry, you lazy rogues!\"   THE BOASTER  Suddenly Alberich saw the giants.  \"Who is this that dares come into my cave?\" he cried. \"Mimi, get back to your work!\"  Then to all the other slaves he called:--  \"Get below, every one of you! Crawl into your dingy shafts and dig the gold! Begone, I say! You must obey the master of the ring!\"  As soon as the black swarm had crept away, Alberich spoke angrily to Wotan and Loki. \"What do you want in here?\"  \"We just came to see you,\" said Wotan. \"We hoped you might be glad to have us. We think you must be a very clever man. We have heard a great deal about the wonderful things you can do.\"  This pleased Alberich. He grew very proud and began to boast.  \"See all this gold of mine!\" he said.  \"Yes,\" answered Loki; \"it is the most gold I have ever seen, but what use is it? It does no one any good in here where nothing useful can be bought with it.\"  \"I am heaping it up,\" said Alberich. \"Some day, with this same treasure, heaped and hid, I hope to work some wonders. You shall see! I shall be master of the whole wide world! Ha! the smoke of Alberich's kingdom shall smudge even your flowery mountain-sides and your sparkling rivers. Everybody shall be my slave! Beware of this black Nibelung, I say, for he shall rule the world!\"   THE WISHING-CAP  Loki was very sly and cunning. While Alberich boasted, he was planning how he might trick the dwarf and take his gold.  To Alberich he said: \"Surely, you will be the mightiest of men. But suppose that while you sleep, one of your slaves should creep upon you and steal your ring?\"  Alberich smiled. \"There is no danger of that,\" he said. \"I will show you a trick or two. Do you see this helmet? It is a magic helmet. With it I can make myself so no one can see me, or I can change myself, quick as a flash, into anything I wish to be. So, you see, I am perfectly safe.\"  \"I never heard of such wonders,\" answered Loki. \"I really cannot believe it.\"  \"I shall prove it to you,\" said the dwarf, never dreaming that the sly Loki was only laying a trap for him. \"What form will you have me take?\"  \"Turn into anything you wish. Only let me see it done and then I shall believe.\"  Alberich put on the helmet. \"Ho! Monster Dragon, come!\" And quick as a flash he turned into a huge dragon.  Loki pretended to be frightened. As the fierce monster squirmed toward him, he made believe that he was going to rush from the cave.   THE TRICK  The dragon vanished and there stood Alberich again.  \"Now do you believe?\" he asked.  \"Indeed, I do,\" replied Loki. \"It is wonderful. But if you could shrink to some tiny thing, it would be even much more clever, because you could creep into a crevice and spy upon your enemies. But, of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9456"],["title","Opera Stories from Wagner (#2)"],["body","e, getting small would be too hard a thing to do.\"  \"Only tell me what you would have me be,\" said Alberich.  \"Now I shall catch him,\" thought Loki. \"Could you make yourself as little as a toad that quickly slinks under the rock when there is danger near?\"  \"Ha! Nothing easier,\" laughed Alberich.  And again putting the helmet on his head he coaxed:--  \"Come, little toad! Creep from your cranny!\" Alberich was gone, and there at Wotan's feet hopped the tiny toad.  \"Quick, Wotan!\" cried Loki.  And in an instant Wotan put his heavy foot upon the toad.  Loki reached down and took the magic wishing-cap.  As soon as the cap was off, the toad disappeared, and there lay Alberich, held fast by Wotan's giant foot.  \"Let me go!\" shrieked the dwarf. \"Take your foot off of me, this minute!\"  Wotan calmly answered: \"You may go when you have promised all I ask.\"  \"Then what do you want?\" groaned Alberich.  \"I want all your glittering gold,\" said Wotan.   THE CURSE  Alberich held the ring close under his breast and muttered to himself: \"They may have the gold! What do I care! With this ring I can soon make my slaves dig more.\"  Then aloud he said: \"You may take the gold. My slaves shall heap it at your feet.\"  He slyly slipped his hand to his lips and, kissing the ring, called his slaves with its magic.  In a moment the little black Nibelungs came in swarms from every shaft, bearing the precious gold.  Alberich did not like to have them see him under Wotan's foot.  \"Heap up the treasure!\" he yelled. \"Don't stop to stare at me. I am still your master. Now, crawl back into your shafts and drudge. I am coming in a minute, and it will not be well for you if I do not find you digging!\"  Trembling with fear, they scurried to the darkest depths.  \"Now, there is your gold!\" said Alberich. \"Give back my helmet and let me go!\"  But Loki quickly tossed the helmet upon the shining heap.  \"Take it, then,\" snarled the dwarf, thinking he could easily, with the power of the ring, force Mimi to make another, \"but let me go, I say!\"  \"Just wait a minute, Alberich,\" said Wotan. \"That ring I saw glittering on your finger,--I must have that too.\"  \"The ring!\" Alberich screamed in horror. \"No, you shall never have the ring!\"  Wotan's face grew stern.  \"That ring does not belong to you. You stole its gold from the Rhine-children,\" he said.  \"Think twice, Wotan, before you take this ring from me! I warn you now a curse goes with it.\"  But Wotan drew the ring from the dwarf's finger, then set him free.  \"Farewell, Alberich! Farewell!\"  \"Ha!\" laughed Alberich in scorn. \"It will never bring you happiness. Its owner shall always feel its curse of care, sorrow, and unrest.\"  Then, turning, he groped his way down the cavern, far poorer than the day he went stealing along the slippery bed of the river. Then, he had no gold. Now, he had no gold and no friends.   THE GREEDY FAFNER  Wotan and Loki hurried back to the mountain-side with their treasure.  At the same time Fafner returned, bringing Freya.  Already Fafner had made up his mind that if he gave Freya back, he must have a very great deal of gold.  When Freya again reached her own country, the sun grew brighter, the air grew sweeter, and the glow of youth came back to the cheeks of Wotan and his family.  \"Here, Fafner, is your gold!\" great Wotan cried.  \"I am sorry to give Freya up,\" said Fafner. \"Pile up the gold between her and me. You may keep her if there is gold enough to hide her completely from my sight. So long as I can see her, I cannot part with her.\"  Then Wotan and his family heaped the glittering gold. They piled it as loosely as they could, but when they had put on all the gold they had, the greedy Fafner cried:--  \"More, more! It is not high enough! Still I can see fair Freya's shimmering hair. Throw on that shining helmet!\"  \"Put it on, Loki,\" commanded Wotan. \"There, Fafner, is your pay. Freya again belongs to me.\"  \"Not yet!\" cried Fafner, as he peeped through a space in the heap. \"I can see her eyes through here.\" Then, pointing to the ring on Wotan's finger: \"Bring that ring and put it in this space.\"  \"Never!\" cried Wotan.  Then Loki spoke. \"The ring belongs to the Rhine-maidens, and Wotan is going to return it to them. Already we have given you more than you should expect, all that shining heap and the helmet besides.\"  \"I will not give you any more!\" roared Wotan. \"Not all the mighty world shall take this ring from my finger!\"  \"Then I shall be gone,\" said Fafner. \"I was afraid you would not give me enough gold. Freya is mine forevermore.\"  Wotan's family began to plead for Freya. \"She is worth more to us than all the gold in this world! Without her we must all wither and die!\"  It was no use to resist. Wotan knew that he dared not lose Freya.  Taking the ring from his finger, he flung it upon the shining heap.   A SLAVE TO GOLD  Fafner gathered up the hoard--the hoard for which he had worked--the hoard for which he had made so much trouble.  He carried it off to his own country. Now that he had it, he had no thought of using it.  He wanted it merely for gold's sake; not for the sake of the great, good things that might be done with it. The only thing he wished to do was to keep others from getting it.  He heaped it up in a cave in the forest. Then he put on the helmet and changed himself into a fierce, ugly dragon.  For the love of mere gold he was willing to give up being a splendid giant, who roamed freely over the beautiful mountains, and to become a hideous, twisting, squirming monster.  The rest of his life he would lie at the door of the cave and guard the treasure. The treasure should lie there useless to all the world.  Fafner,--a slave to gold!   THE BEAUTIFUL VALHALLA  As Fafner carried away his treasure, a great storm gathered over the mountain crest.  The sky grew black. The thunder rolled. Its echoes bounded on from cloud to cloud, from peak to peak, then rumbled down the valleys to the sea.  Then the clouds drifted away. The setting sun shot its long rays into the deep valley.  There, arching over the river and reaching from the flowery mountain-side to the very door of the gleaming castle, stood a shining rainbow bridge.  \"Lo! our castle! Our beautiful Valhalla!\" cried the king. \"Let us cross over. It shall be our dwelling-place forevermore.\"  One by one they stepped upon the bridge.  As Wotan walked slowly and sadly over, he heard the wailing of the Rhine-maidens in the river below:--    \"Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold!   We long for your light!\"  \"I shall never be happy again,\" thought Wotan. \"I have given my honor for Valhalla. What an awful price I have paid!\"     THE WALKUERE   A MATCHLESS SWORD  Many years passed. The giants lived on in their beautiful Valhalla.  But their king was sad.  He could not forget Alberich's curse. What if Alberich should in some way gain possession of the ring again! He would destroy Valhalla.  \"Oh, why was I not brave enough to give the ring back to the Rhine-children!\" sighed Wotan.  \"If only it might again be a mere thing of beauty to gladden their hearts, but so long as it is in the world, how many more will it not rob of their happiness.  \"Surely, some great hero must come who will be brave enough to slay the dragon and give the ring back to its rightful owners.\"  Said Wotan to himself, \"I shall make a mighty sword, and when the hero comes, his sword will be ready for him.\"  Then the great Wotan wrought a matchless sword.  When it was finished, he took it and went into the forest. Straight he went to the home of the bold robber Hunding.  It was a beautiful moonlight night when he reached Hunding's hut.  From the loud laughter and shouting that Wotan heard as he neared the hut, he knew that Hunding and his friends were having a merry feast.  Wotan lifted the latch and entered.  The great, rude room was built around the trunk of a mighty ash tree.  The walls were made of roughly hewn logs.  The floors were covered with the skins of wild animals of the forest.  Mats of reeds and grasses hung upon the walls.  The huge fireplace was built of rough stones.  The mighty Wotan scowled upon the crowd.  Then, lifting the gleaming sword above his head, with one great lunging blow, he buried the bright blade, even to its hilt, in the great ash tree's quivering side.  Then, turning to the guests, he said:--  \"The sword shall belong to him who can draw it from the ash tree's heart.\"  [Illustration: HE TUGGED IN VAIN]  Though each guest tugged with all his might, he tugged in vain.  In the years that followed, many came and went, and all tried hard to gain the sword, and still that magic blade slept on within the ash tree's sheath.   THE VALIANT SIEGMUND  One very dark and stormy night, Siegmund, a brave warrior, wandered alone in the forest.  That day a desperate battle had been fought.  As the darkness came on, Siegmund escaped from the enemy.  He had lost his weapons, and now he trudged through the pathless woods, seeking some place where he might find balm for his wounds and shelter from the raging storm.  He was almost exhausted when he caught sight of a flickering candlelight in the window of a forest hut.  With the little strength that he had left, he dragged himself to its door.  No one answered his call, and no longer caring if it were the home of friend or foe, he opened the door, and staggering in he sank upon the hearth.  As he looked about him he thought, \"This is the home of some forest chief.\"  A great fire burned in the rude fireplace, and, as he grew warm, being worn and weary, he sank into a heavy sleep.   HUNDING'S WIFE  As Siegmund slept, the door of the inner room was gently opened and a beautiful woman stole softly in.  She was clad in snowy white.  Her head was crowned with a wealth of golden hair.  She had heard Siegmund as he entered the room, and, thinking her chieftain had returned from the hunt, she came to greet him.  Instead she saw a stranger on the hearth, and, drawing near, she saw that his face looked sad and"]]]
