She walked very slowly, therefore, a frown between her brows, discontent and jealousy in her heart.  Bessie was waiting for her at the gate.  \"Why, Alice,\" called out Bessie, \"how late you are. We shan't get to Harley Grove by five o'clock.\"  \"I can't help being late; it is a blessing you see me now,\" answered Alice. \"I wonder you waited for me, Bessie.\"  \"Well, my dear,\" answered Bessie, \"I would much rather walk with you than take a solitary ramble by myself. I thought,\" she added, \"you were going to bring that new Irish girl with you. Has she come?\"  \"Has she not come?\" answered Alice. \"Oh, Bessie, Bessie, it is because of her I am late. Oh, Bessie, she is quite too dreadful.\"  \"How so?\" asked Bessie.  \"She is the most extraordinary, wild, reckless, absolutely unladylike, vulgar person I ever came across in the whole course of my life.\"  \"What a lot of adjectives!\" laughed Bessie. \"I shall be quite curious to see her; from your description she must be a monster.\"  \"She is a monster, a human monster,\" answered Alice; \"and the worst of it is, Bessie, that in some extraordinary way she has fascinated both father and mother, and even Fred--Fred, who hates girls as a rule; they are all so taken up with this blessed Kitty Malone that they don't mind her perfectly savage manners. I can tell you I am quite miserable about it.\"  \"Poor Alice,\" answered Bessie in a sympathetic tone. \"I suppose then, dear, she is not coming with us?\"  \"Oh, yes, she is; she is following us. She could not find anything quiet enough to put on.\"  \"Quiet enough to put on! What do you mean?\"  \"Oh, my dear, her wardrobe is beyond description. She absolutely wanted to come to poor Gwin's quiet little tea party in a dress fit for a ball, flounced and frilled and laced and ribboned, and with a train to it, absolutely a train, although she is not fifteen yet.\"  Bessie could not help laughing. \"I am sorry she is fond of dress,\" she answered; \"I can't bear that sort of girl.\"  \"Oh, you'll positively loathe her, Bessie. I quite pity you at the thought of having to walk with her this afternoon.\"  \"My dear Alice, we must make the best of it,\" answered Bessie, \"and I don't suppose she will quite kill me; she will be amusing at any rate.\"  \"Amusing enough to those who have not got to live with her day and night,\" answered Alice in a very discontented voice. \"Oh, and here she comes,\" she added; \"and, look, she is running and racing down the road and waving her hands to us. Oh, Bessie, it is intolerable! Don't you pity me?\"  \"What! is that the girl?\" cried Bessie. \"How very--\"  \"How very what?\" asked Alice.  \"How very pretty she is!\"  \"Pretty,\" said Alice in a tone of such withering scorn that Bessie could not help gazing at her friend in astonishment.     CHAPTER IV.  TIFFS ALL AROUND.   Kitty's dark-blue skirt was all that was correct and proper; it reached just to her ankles, and her remarkably small and beautifully-shaped feet were encased in the neatest possible tan boots. But the blouse of light pink silk, all bedizened with bunches of ribbons and lappets of lace, was in Alice's eyes almost as painfully unsuitable as the trained skirt. Kitty wore a little close-fitting cap of dark-blue velvet on her head. Her hair, of the softest, cloudiest black, true Irish hair, was piled up in a thick mass behind; in front it waved and curled round her white forehead. Kitty was very tall, and, child as she still was in years, had a more formed figure than most girls of her age. She was drawing on her tan gloves now, and unfurling a parasol of tussore silk with a heavy lace fall.  \"I do hope I'm smart enough,\" she said, panting slightly as she spoke. \"Is this one of your schoolfellows?\"  \"Yes; my friend, Miss Challoner.\"  \"Haven't you got a Christian name?\" asked Kitty, staring frankly with her wide-open eyes at Alice's friend.  \"Bessie is my name,\" answered Bessie Challoner.  \"Do you mind my calling it to you? I like Challoner awfully, and if I were to say Challoner without the Miss it might do, but Miss is so stiff. I hope I may be Kitty to you, and then you won't object to being Bessie to me.\"  \"Not a bit,\" answered Bessie heartily; \"but we are a little late, and had better walk on as fast as we can.\"  Gwin Harley lived in a beautiful house about two miles away, and the girls turned down a path which led across some fields in the direction of Harley Grove. The time of year was toward the end of May, and the weather was perfect.  Kitty, who had been silent for a time, now stood in the middle of the field, threw both her hands to her sides, let her parasol drop on the ground, and opened her mouth wide.  \"Have you gone quite mad?\" asked Alice in a severe tone.  \"Mad is it?\" said Kitty; \"not I. I am taking in some of the air.\" Here she began to breathe very deeply and with considerable noise. \"Why, my ducky girls, the pair of you, I was fairly suffocated in that bandbox of a house; now the breeze here is fine and fresh, and I want to fill my lungs. Is there any objection?\"  \"Oh, none I am sure,\" answered Bessie; \"but you really did look most extraordinary.\"  \"I am glad no one was passing at the moment,\" said Alice. \"What would they have thought?\"  \"Does it matter what they think?\" asked Kitty. \"We never mind what anyone thinks of us in Ireland. Ah, the dear old place; how I pine for it! There now, my lungs are full, and we can go on again.\"  She picked up her parasol and began to stride forward.  \"Isn't she a horror?\" whispered Alice to Bessie.  \"Hush!\" answered Bessie; \"she only does it to amuse us. The thing is to take very little notice; we'll soon tame her down.\"  \"Is it taming me you're after?\" called back Kitty. \"Well, then, you'll never do that, for I come of a wild lot, and I have always been called Wild Kitty from the moment I could speak. But there's no harm in me, not a bit. Now, then, I'll walk as sober as you please. What shall we talk about?\"  \"Is there anything you would like to ask us?\" said Bessie.  \"I am sure then, darling, I don't think there is. Wouldn't you like to ask me some questions? I'm as open as day. I'll lay bare all the thoughts of my secret soul to the pair of you, if you care to hear them.\"  \"I don't know that we do,\" said Bessie. \"You see we have got to make your acquaintance yet, Kitty.\"  \"Ah, now it's nice of you to call me Kitty, and that's a very pretty little voice you have; soft and winning. How is it you say some of those words? I can't get my tongue round them; but I dare say I will after a bit.\"  \"Would you like to know what kind of place we are going to?\" asked Bessie.  \"Oh, I'll wait until I get there,\" answered Kitty. \"I suppose it's like all other places; there's a house and some girls; and if we are asked to tea, why we'll get tea, and they'll think me no end of an oddity, and I'll think them a lot of muffs; but that don't matter. Oh, my dears, if you only saw Old Ireland, and if you only knew the free life we have there, and the beautiful air that comes blowing in from the broad Atlantic. Why, it's smothered I'll be in this queer place. I doubt if I'll stay long. I'll write to father, and ask him to take me back again.\"  \"I would if I were you,\" said Alice stoutly.  \"Now, what do you mean by that, 'Alice, aroon?'\"  \"I mean,\" said Alice, who had now almost lost control over her temper, \"that if you go on as you have done since you came here, we shall none of us like you, and I for one shall be delighted when you return to Ireland.\"  As Alice spoke Kitty's charming face suddenly lost its brilliant color; it became white, and her dark eyes flashed with an angry fire. She stood perfectly still for a moment, then began to walk on a little faster than before.  \"You have hurt her, Alice,\" said Bessie; \"you should not have said that.\"  \"I don't care; she made me do it; she is intolerable.\"  \"Still, you had no right to speak as you did; remember she is a stranger.\"  Here Bessie ran after Kitty, and tried to slip her hand through her arm; but the Irish girl made an impatient movement, and, shrugging her shoulders, walked on quicker than before.  \"Oh, leave her alone,\" whispered Alice; \"let us talk about things that interest us. Why should all lives be upset by her? There, she is going on in front; let us fall back and talk about interesting things. Have you finished your work yet?\"  \"Oh, yes; I had a great deal to do this afternoon. I do hope, Alice, that Gwin won't mind if I ask her to let me go into the library. I must take a peep into 'Household Encyclopædia;' it is such a chance.\"  \"Oh, I am sure she won't mind,\" replied Alice. \"Gwin is the soul of good nature. I only dread what she will think.\"  \"Oh, you need not dread anything,\" said Kitty, suddenly turning round and coming back to the girls. \"I shan't be here long; don't be afraid.\"  \"Please, Kitty,\" said Bessie; \"don't mind what Alice said just now, she was vexed, because we are not quite accustomed to manners like yours. You will soon get into our ways, you know.\"  \"Never, never!\" cried Kitty.  \"Well, at any rate, don't mind about it now. Do you think you will like your school life?\"  \"No; I shall just hate it.\"  \"What a pity that will be; but I'm sure you don't know what you are saying. You are vexed with Alice, and I don't wonder--Alice, you were very hard on her.\"  \"Oh, never mind,\" answered Kitty; \"don't ask her to apologize. I can go home again. I don't want to be with people who have made up their minds to dislike me. All the folks at home love me, and--\" Here tears dropped from her eyes, splashing down her cheeks in bright round pearls.  \"I didn't mean to vex you,\" said Alice, who was disconcerted at this evident grief. \"I dare say I shall get accustomed to you after a bit. I mean I do not really want you to go home.\"  Kitty's face underwent a change, rapid as a flash"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9986"],["title","Wild Kitty (#5)"],["body"," lightning.  \"If you want to make friends, Alice, it's as right as rain,\" she cried. \"I know I was vexed, but it is over now; yes it is over. I am willing to be friends if you are willing.\"  \"Of course,\" said Alice; \"and I know I ought not to have spoken as I did; but you do manage to fret me dreadfully. I never saw a girl exactly like you before.\"  \"It is all right now you really want to be friends,\" answered Kitty; \"and I will try to be as dull as you please.\" Here she paused and seemed to consider. \"There's no use,\" she continued after a moment; \"I mean I must be myself whatever happens. I must be genuine. Please, Alice, let me be genuine for a week; if at the end of that time you find me intolerable, why I'll be off.\"  \"Don't say anything about that,\" said Bessie; \"everything is quite new to you, and Alice did speak unkindly; but please, Kitty, don't be angry if I say something.\"  \"Oh, no, I won't be angry with you; you're a real duck,\" cried Kitty.  \"Well, we English girls are not quite accustomed to your sort of way; we are quieter here and more reserved. Perhaps you had better--\"  \"Oh, I know exactly what the end of that pretty little speech is going to be,\" said Kitty; \"but I cannot. I must be Kitty Malone or nothing. I was born that way. Why, bless you, it is in our race. Aunt Bridget was just the same when she was young, and so was Aunt Honora, and even father; oh, and--and Laurie. If you only saw Laurie and Pat! Oh, I wish you knew Laurie; if you saw him you would say, 'If there is a broth of a boy in the world he is one.'\"  The girls had now reached the avenue gates at Harley Lodge, and the lodge-keeper ran out to open them. A few moments later they found themselves in sight of the pretty, modern mansion which Mr. Harley had lately purchased. The door was opened by a butler in very correct livery, and the young folk were shown into a handsome drawing-room at the other side of a broad hall. There was no one in the room when they entered, and Kitty walked straight up to a glass let into the wall, and began to survey herself with intense satisfaction. She had by this time forgotten the rebuff which Alice had given her, tears had only added to the brightness of her eyes, and her momentary fit of vexation and temper had deepened the color in her blooming cheeks. She nodded to herself with smiles of intense satisfaction, pushed her velvet cap in a slightly more coquettish way over her mass of black curls, and began once again to dance a very graceful _pas de seul_ in front of the glass.  \"I do think I have nice feet,\" she said; and just at that moment the door was opened, and Gwin Harley and Elma Lewis entered the room.  Gwin, statuesque, graceful, dressed in the most suitable manner, made a perfect contrast to poor, excitable Kitty. Kitty's words had been plainly audible, and Alice flushed deeply with vexation.  \"Why, then, I had better introduce myself,\" said Kitty, who was by no means abashed. \"Are you Miss Harley? You have got a very nice looking glass, let me tell you; it shows off the figure to perfection.\"  Gwin could not help coloring in surprise and astonishment.  \"I am Kitty Malone, at your service,\" continued Kitty. \"Shall I drop you a courtesy in the true Irish way? Some of us bob like this--so, and some of us step back like this,\" here Kitty performed a very elaborate and very graceful courtesy, then stood upright, and laughing heartily, showed rows of pearly teeth. Gwin held out her hand.  \"May I introduce my friend, Elma Lewis? Elma, this is Miss Malone.\"  \"Kitty Malone. I won't be called Miss Malone,\" said the incorrigible Kitty.  \"Won't you all come upstairs now, girls?\" said Gwin, who perceived that both Alice and Bessie were annoyed by Kitty's manners.  \"If we take off our things we can go into the library and have a good game before tea, or would you prefer a walk?\"  \"Well, I for one am tired,\" said Kitty. \"The fact is,\" she continued, these boots are somewhat tight. They're awfully becoming, you know, aren't they? but they do squeeze a little just across the toes; how ever, as Aunt Honora says, 'Pride feels no pain,' and I am desperate proud of my feet. Shall we all look at our feet, and see which has got the prettiest pair?\"  \"I don't think we will just at present,\" said Gwin. \"If you are tired you must take your boots off. Have you not just come from Ireland?\"  \"Bless you, yes,\" answered Kitty; \"I only arrived to-day. The place is as new to me as it can be. Up to the present I don't think much of it, although you have got a lovely house, Miss Harley--fine and airy with plenty of big rooms. I suppose you have got money _galore_; have you?\"  \"I believe we have,\" said Gwin in some astonishment, and a haughty note coming into her voice.  \"Ah, now, don't begin to be proud and stiff!\" exclaimed Kitty. \"It is quite wonderful; every one I speak to here seems to take me the wrong way. What in the world do you all mean? I thought when I came to England that people would say, 'Well, now, that's a remarkably pretty girl. I am sure she's Irish by the twinkle in her eye and the roll of the brogue in her voice; but we'll like her all the better for that.' But, bless my heart! that's not the way you're taking me. Every time I open my lips somebody seems to think I have said something wrong. Upon my word it's a nice state of things, and I, the darling of my old father. If Aunt Honora and Aunt Bridget were here they would soon put matters straight; and Laurie, dear, darling, old Laurie, if he saw his Kitty put upon, wouldn't he give it to you all?\"  \"We none of us want to put upon you, Miss Malone,\" said Gwin Harley.  \"_Miss_ Malone!\"  \"Yes,\" said Gwin firmly, \"it is the custom here to call girls by their surnames for a little until we get to know them; but I am sure,\" she added kindly, \"you will soon be Kitty with us all, for I see you are very nice, although you have not quite our ways.\"  \"Ah, there, that is all I want you to say,\" answered Kitty with a profound sigh, \"and now I'll go upstairs and slip off my bits of boots, for they are a trifle tight. Can you lend me a pair of your shoes, Miss Harley?\"  \"Yes, with pleasure,\" replied Gwin, and turning, she led the way out of the room. The rest of the evening passed off better. Kitty became a little subdued, and satisfied herself with talking less, and casting ravishing glances of delight and roguish entreaty first at one girl and then at the other. It was extremely difficult to withstand her, for her voice was low and singularly sweet, her eyes were beautiful, she could not do an ungraceful thing, she was altogether like a bright, flashing meteor, and soon she began to exercise an extraordinary fascination both over Bessie Challoner and Gwin Harley. Having got over her first astonishment, Gwin began to take a sincere interest in the pretty stranger. The lovely expression of her coral lips made her long to kiss them, and to assure the Irish girl that she for one would be her friend; but the next instant Kitty said something so very much against the grain that Gwin felt as much repulsed as a moment before she was delighted.  Immediately after tea Bessie went off to the library to hunt up her darling \"Encyclopædia.\"  \"Now that she has gone,\" exclaimed Gwin, \"we are not likely to get her back for some time. What a remarkably earnest student she is!\"  \"The Earnest Student?\" interrupted Kitty. \"I thought that was the name of a religious book. I think father has got it at home.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" replied Gwin, \"but we always call it to Bessie. She is wonderfully clever. She gets on splendidly at school, taking everything before her. I am certain she is the kind of girl who will make her mark by and by.\"  \"I hate studies!\" said Kitty in her low, humorous voice.  \"I am sorry for that,\" answered Gwin, \"for if you come to school you won't be at all popular if you do not care for your books.\"  \"Popular? How do you mean? Is it with the teachers or with the girls?\"  \"Well, with both I fancy.\"  \"Then, I tell you what,\" exclaimed Kitty, \"I'd like to bet with you that you are wrong--that I'll be the most popular girl in the whole of the school with the teachers--yes, with the teachers--and the scholars as well.\"  \"You must be very conceited,\" exclaimed Elma, who had sat silent during the greater part of the evening, taking Kitty in, however, all the same.  \"Conceited? No more than you are,\" cried Kitty, \"but I know my powers, and I have not kissed the Blarney Stone for nothing.\"  \"Oh, you need not tell us that ridiculous story over again,\" said Alice.  \"But I should like to hear it,\" cried Gwin.  \"You really would not Gwin; it is too absurd. We must show Kitty, now she has come to live among us, what is real wit and what is not. Her way of talking is only silly.\"  Gwin knit her brows, and looked pained.  \"I would rather not correct her now,\" she said in a gentle voice. Then she added, her eyes sparkling with sudden eagerness, \"Would it not be a good opportunity for talking over the rules of our society, girls?\"  \"Oh yes,\" cried Elma, \"yes; but is it well to----\"  Here she bent forward, and began to whisper vigorously in Gwin's ear.  \"Yes, I think so,\" answered Gwin.  \"I wouldn't, I really wouldn't,\" said Elma. \"I am certain Alice agrees with me.\"  \"I can guess what you are saying,\" cried Alice, \"and I do agree most heartily.\"  \"And I can guess what you are saying,\" exclaimed Kitty, starting to her feet with flashing eyes. \"You don't want to talk about your society or whatever it is because I am present. Well, discuss it without me. I'll find my way to the library. Poor dear Bessie is the only decent one among you, and I shall go and sit with her. How do you know I won't take up with literature just to spite you all? I can do anything I have a mind to, and that you will soon find to your cost.\"  She ran out of the room as she spoke, slamming the door behind her.  \"There, that's a comfort,\" cried Alice, breathing freely for the first time. \"Did you ever, girls, in"]]]
