Your eggs are carried from the kitchen to the dining-room table on a plate.  Your milk is brought to you in a china mug. Then go to the store-room (if there is no store-room in your house go to the nearest Delicatessen store). You will see how all the things which we are supposed to eat tomorrow and next week and next year have been put away in jars and cans and other artificial containers which Nature did not provide for us but which man was forced to invent and perfect before he could be assured of his regular meals all the year around.  Even a gas-tank is nothing but a large pitcher, made of iron because iron does not break as easily as china and is less porous than clay. So are barrels and bottles and pots and pans. They all serve the same purpose--of providing us in the future with those things of which we happen to have an abundance at the present moment.  And because he could preserve eatable things for the day of need, man began to raise vegetables and grain and saved the surplus for future consumption.  This explains why, during the late Stone Age, we find the first wheat-fields and the first gardens, grouped around the settlements of the early pile-dwellers.  It also tells us why man gave up his habit of wandering and settled down in one fixed spot where he raised his children until the day of his death when he was decently buried among his own people.  [Illustration: PREHISTORIC MAN IS DISCOVERED.]  It is safe to say that these earliest ancestors of ours would have given up the ways of savages of their own accord if they had been left to their fate.  But suddenly there was an end to their isolation.  Prehistoric man was discovered.  A traveler from the unknown south-land who had dared to cross the turbulent sea and the forbidding mountain passes had found his way to the wild people of Central Europe.  On his back he carried a pack.  When he had spread his wares before the gaping curiosity of the bewildered natives, their eyes beheld wonders of which their minds had never dared to dream.  They saw bronze hammers and axes and tools made of iron and helmets made of copper and beautiful ornaments consisting of a strangely colored substance which the foreign visitor called \"glass.\"  And overnight the Age of Stone came to an end.  It was replaced by a new civilization which had discarded wooden and stone implements centuries before and had laid the foundations for that \"Age of Metal\" which has endured until our own day.  It is of this new civilization that I shall tell you in the rest of my book and if you do not mind, we shall leave the northern continent for a couple of thousand years and pay a visit to Egypt and to western Asia.  \"But,\" you will say, \"this is not fair. You promise to tell us about prehistoric man and then, just when the story is going to be interesting, you close the chapter and you jump to another part of the world and we must jump with you whether we like it or not.\"  I know. It does not seem the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, history is not at all like mathematics.  When you solve a sum you go from \"a\" to \"b\" and from \"b\" to \"c\" and from \"c\" to \"d\" and so on.  History on the other hand jumps from \"a\" to \"z\" and then back to \"f\" and next to \"m\" without any apparent respect for neatness and order.  There is a good reason for this.  History is not exactly a science.  It tells the story of the human race and most people, however much we may try to change their nature, refuse to behave with the regularity and the precision of the tables of multiplication.  No two men ever do precisely the same thing.  No two human brains ever reach exactly the same conclusion.  You will notice that for yourself when you grow up.  It was not different a few hundred centuries ago.  Prehistoric man, as I just told you, was on a fair way to progress.  He had managed to survive the ice and the snow and the wild animals and that in itself, was a great deal.  He had invented many useful things.  Suddenly, however, other people in a different part of the world entered the race.  They rushed forward at a terrible speed and within a very short space of time they reached a height of civilization which had never before been seen upon our planet. Then they set forth to teach what they knew to the others who had been less intelligent than themselves.  Now that I have explained this to you, does it not seem just to give the Egyptians and the people of western Asia their full share of the chapters of this book?    THE EARLIEST SCHOOL OF THE HUMAN RACE  We are the children of a practical age.  We travel from place to place in our own little locomotives which we call automobiles.  When we wish to speak to a friend whose home is a thousand miles away, we say \"Hello\" into a rubber tube and ask for a certain telephone number in Chicago.  At night when the room grows dark we push a button and there is light.  If we happen to be cold we push another button and the electric stove spreads its pleasant glow through our study.  On the other hand in summer when it is hot the same electric current will start a small artificial storm (an electric fan) which keeps us cool and comfortable.  We seem to be the masters of all the forces of nature and we make them work for us as if they were our very obedient slaves.  But do not forget one thing when you pride yourself upon our splendid achievements.  We have constructed the edifice of our modern civilization upon the fundament of wisdom that had been built at great pains by the people of the ancient world.  Do not be afraid of their strange names which you will meet upon every page of the coming chapters.  Babylonians and Egyptians and Chaldeans and Sumerians are all dead and gone, but they continue to influence our own lives in everything we do, in the letters we write, in the language we use, in the complicated mathematical problems which we must solve before we can build a bridge or a skyscraper.  And they deserve our grateful respect as long as our planet continues to race through the wide space of the high heavens.  These ancient people of whom I shall now tell you lived in three definite spots.  Two of these were found along the banks of vast rivers.  The third was situated on the shores of the Mediterranean.  The oldest center of civilization developed in the valley of the Nile, in a country which was called Egypt.  The second was located in the fertile plains between two big rivers of western Asia, to which the ancients gave the name of Mesopotamia.  The third one which you will find along the shore of the Mediterranean, was inhabited by the Phoenicians, the earliest of all colonizers and by the Jews who bestowed upon the rest of the world the main principles of their moral laws.  This third center of civilization is known by its ancient Babylonian name of Suri, or as we pronounce it, Syria.  The history of the people who lived in these regions covers more than five thousand years.  It is a very, very complicated story.  I can not give you many details.  I shall try and weave their adventures into a single fabric, which will look like one of those marvelous rugs of which you read in the tales which Scheherazade told to Harun the Just.    THE KEY OF STONE  Fifty years before the birth of Christ, the Romans conquered the land along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and among this newly acquired territory was a country called Egypt.  The Romans, who are to play such a great role in our history, were a race of practical men.  They built bridges, they constructed roads, and with a small but highly trained army of soldiers and civil officers, they managed to rule the greater part of Europe, of eastern Africa and western Asia.  As for art and the sciences, these did not interest them very much. They regarded with suspicion a man who could play the lute or who could write a poem about Spring and only thought him little better than the clever fellow who could walk the tightrope or who had trained his poodle dog to stand on its hind legs. They left such things to the Greeks and to the Orientals, both of whom they despised, while they themselves spent their days and nights keeping order among the thousand and one nations of their vast empire.  When they first set foot in Egypt that country was already terribly old.  More than six thousand and five hundred years had gone by since the history of the Egyptian people had begun.  Long before any one had dreamed of building a city amidst the swamps of the river Tiber, the kings of Egypt had ruled far and wide and had made their court the center of all civilization.  While the Romans were still savages who chased wolves and bears with clumsy stone axes, the Egyptians were writing books, performing intricate medical operations and teaching their children the tables of multiplication.  This great progress they owed chiefly to one very wonderful invention, to the art of preserving their spoken words and their ideas for the benefit of their children and grandchildren.  We call this the art of writing.  We are so familiar with writing that we can not understand how people ever managed to live without books and newspapers and magazines.  But they did and it was the main reason why they made such slow progress during the first million years of their stay upon this planet.  They were like cats and dogs who can only teach their puppies and their kittens a few simple things (barking at a stranger and climbing trees and such things) and who, because they can not write, possess no way in which they can use the experience of their countless ancestors.  This sounds almost funny, doesn't it?  And why make such a fuss about so simple a matter?  But did you ever stop to think what happens when you write a letter?  Suppose that you are taking a trip in the mountains and you have seen a deer.  You want to tell this to your father who is in the city.  What do you do?  You put a lot of dots and dashes upon a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9991"],["title","Ancient Man: The Beginning of Civilizations (#3)"],["body","of paper--you add a few more dots and dashes upon an envelope and you carry your epistle to the mailbox together with a two-cent stamp.  What have you really been doing?  You have changed a number of spoken words into a number of pothooks and scrawls.  But how did you know how to make your curlycues in such a fashion that both the postman and your father could retranslate them into spoken words?  You knew, because some one had taught you how to draw the precise figures which represented the sound of your spoken words.  Just take a few letters and see the way this game is played.  We make a guttural noise and write down a \"G.\"  We let the air pass through our closed teeth and we write down \"S.\"  We open our mouth wide and make a noise like a steam engine and the sound is written down \"H.\"  It took the human race hundreds of thousands of years to discover this and the credit for it goes to the Egyptians.  Of course they did not use the letters which have been used to print this book.  They had a system of their own.  It was much prettier than ours but not quite so simple.  It consisted of little figures and images of things around the house and around the farm, of knives and plows and birds and pots and pans. These little figures their scribes scratched and painted upon the wall of the temples, upon the coffins of their dead kings and upon the dried leaves of the papyrus plant which has given its name to our \"paper.\"  But when the Romans entered this vast library they showed neither enthusiasm nor interest.  They possessed a system of writing of their own which they thought vastly superior.  [Illustration: THE KEY OF STONE]  They did not know that the Greeks (from whom they had learned their alphabet) had in turn obtained theirs from the Phoenicians who had again borrowed with great success from the old Egyptians. They did not know and they did not care. In their schools the Roman alphabet was taught exclusively and what was good enough for the Roman children was good enough for everybody else.  You will understand that the Egyptian language did not long survive the indifference and the opposition of the Roman governors. It was forgotten. It died just as the languages of most of our Indian tribes have become a thing of the past.  The Arabs and the Turks who succeeded the Romans as the rulers of Egypt abhorred all writing that was not connected with their holy book, the Koran.  At last in the middle of the sixteenth century a few western visitors came to Egypt and showed a mild interest in these strange pictures.  But there was no one to explain their meaning and these first Europeans were as wise as the Romans and the Turks had been before them.  Now it happened, late in the eighteenth century that a certain French general by the name of Buonaparte visited Egypt. He did not go there to study ancient history. He wanted to use the country as a starting point for a military expedition against the British colonies in India. This expedition failed completely but it helped solve the mysterious problem of the ancient Egyptian writing.  Among the soldiers of Napoleon Buonaparte there was a young officer by the name of Broussard. He was stationed at the fortress of St. Julien on the western mouth of the Nile which is called the Rosetta river.  Broussard liked to rummage among the ruins of the lower Nile and one day he found a stone which greatly puzzled him.  Like everything else in that neighborhood, it was covered with picture writing.  But this slab of black basalt was different from anything that had ever been discovered.  It carried three inscriptions and one of these (oh joy!) was in Greek.  The Greek language was known.  As it was almost certain that the Egyptian part contained a translation of the Greek (or vice versa), the key to ancient Egyptian seemed to have been discovered.  But it took more than thirty years of very hard work before the key had been made to fit the lock.  Then the mysterious door was opened and the ancient treasure house of Egypt was forced to surrender its secrets.  The man who gave his life to the task of deciphering this language was Jean Francois Champollion--usually called Champollion Junior to distinguish him from his older brother who was also a very learned man.  Champollion Junior was a baby when the French revolution broke out and therefore he escaped serving in the armies of the General Buonaparte.  While his countrymen were marching from one glorious victory to another (and back again as such Imperial armies are apt to do) Champollion studied the language of the Copts, the native Christians of Egypt. At the age of nineteen he was appointed a professor of History at one of the smaller French universities and there he began his great work of translating the pictures of the old Egyptian language.  For this purpose he used the famous black stone of Rosetta which Broussard had discovered among the ruins near the mouth of the Nile.  The original stone was still in Egypt. Napoleon had been forced to vacate the country in a hurry and he had left this curiosity behind. When the English retook Alexandria in the year 1801 they found the stone and carried it to London, where you may see it this very day in the British Museum. The Inscriptions however had been copied and had been taken to France, where they were used by Champollion.  The Greek text was quite clear. It contained the story of Ptolemy V and his wife Cleopatra, the grandmother of that other Cleopatra about whom Shakespeare wrote. The other two inscriptions, however, refused to surrender their secrets.  One of them was in hieroglyphics, the name we give to the oldest known Egyptian writing. The word Hieroglyphic is Greek and means \"sacred carving.\" It is a very good name for it fully describes the purpose and nature of this script. The priests who had invented this art did not want the common people to become too familiar with the deep mysteries of preserving speech. They made writing a sacred business.  They surrounded it with much mystery and decreed that the carving of hieroglyphics be regarded as a sacred art and forbade the people to practice it for such a common purpose as business or commerce.  They could enforce this rule with success so long as the country was inhabited by simple farmers who lived at home and grew everything they needed upon their own fields. But gradually Egypt became a land of traders and these traders needed a means of communication beyond the spoken word. So they boldly took the little figures of the priests and simplified them for their own purposes. Thereafter they wrote their business letters in the new script which became known as the \"popular language\" and which we call by its Greek name, the \"Demotic language.\"  The Rosetta stone carried both the sacred and the popular translations of the Greek text and upon these two Champollion centered his attack. He collected every piece of Egyptian script which he could get and together with the Rosetta stone he compared and studied them until after twenty years of patient drudgery he understood the meaning of fourteen little figures.  That means that he spent more than a whole year to decipher each single picture.  Finally he went to Egypt and in the year 1823 he printed the first scientific book upon the subject of the ancient hieroglyphics.  Nine years later he died from overwork, as a true martyr to the great task which he had set himself as a boy.  His work, however, lived after him.  Others continued his studies and today Egyptologists can read hieroglyphics as easily as we can read the printed pages of our newspapers.  Fourteen pictures in twenty years seems very slow work. But let me tell you something of Champollion's difficulties. Then you will understand, and understanding, you will admire his courage.  The old Egyptians did not use a simple sign language. They had passed beyond that stage.  Of course, you know what sign language is.  Every Indian story has a chapter about queer messages, written in the form of little pictures. Hardly a boy but at some stage or other of his life, as a buffalo hunter or an Indian fighter, has invented a sign language of his own, and all Boy Scouts are familiar with it. But Egyptian was something quite different and I must try and make this clear to you with a few pictures. Suppose that you were Champollion and that you were reading an old papyrus which told the story of a farmer who lived somewhere along the banks of the river Nile.  Suddenly you came across a picture of a man with a saw.  [Illustration: saw]  \"Very well,\" you said, \"that means, of course, that the farmer went out and cut a tree down.\" Most likely you had guessed correctly.  Next you took another page of hieroglyphics.  They told the story of a queen who had lived to be eighty-two years old. Right in the middle of the text the same picture occurred. That was very puzzling, to say the least. Queens do not go about cutting down trees. They let other people do it for them. A young queen may saw wood for the sake of exercise, but a queen of eighty-two stays at home with her cat and her spinning wheel. Yet, the picture was there. The ancient priest who drew it must have placed it there for a definite purpose.  What could he have meant?  That was the riddle which Champollion finally solved.  He discovered that the Egyptians were the first people to use what we call \"phonetic writing.\"  Like most other words which express a scientific idea, the word \"phonetic\" is of Greek origin. It means the \"science of the sound which is made by our speech.\" You have seen the Greek word \"phone,\" which means the voice, before. It occurs in our word \"telephone,\" the machine which carries the voice to a distant point.  Ancient Egyptian was \"phonetic\" and it set man free from the narrow limits of that sign language which in some primitive form had been used ever since the cave-dweller began to scratch pictures of wild animals upon the walls of his home.
