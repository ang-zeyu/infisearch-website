Often, however, when he lay stretched out in his contentment on the Pulpit-rock, and gazed down into the sunny valley below, he had to think how he had sat that time with the heavy burden on his heart, under the Rain-rock, and all happiness was gone; and he would say again and again in his heart: \"I know now what I will do, so that it will never happen again: I will do nothing that will prevent me from looking up gladly to heaven, because this is right to the dear Lord.\"  But if it chanced that Moni became too long absorbed in his meditation, one or another of the goats would come along, gaze wonderingly at him and try to attract his attention by bleating, which oftentimes he did not hear for quite a while. Only when MÃ¤ggerli came and called after him longingly, then he heard at once and came leaping to it immediately, for his affectionate little kid always remained Moni's dearest possession."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9384"],["title","The Comrade in White (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders          THE COMRADE IN WHITE   By The Rev. W. H. Leathem, M. A.   Introduction By Hugh Black     \"I shall not fear the battle   If Thou art by my side.\"    1916     INTRODUCTION  The Great War has put a strain on the resources of human nature, as well as on material resources. Men who have come through the hell of the trenches have discovered some of the secrets of life and death. Many of them have known a reinforcement of spiritual power. It is quite natural that this fact should often be described in emotional form as direct interposition of angels and other supernatural agencies. Among these the most beautiful and tender stories are those of \"The Comrade in White.\" In essence they are all testimony to the perennial fount of strength and comfort of religion--the human need which in all generations has looked up and found God a present help in times of trouble.  The origin of the many stories brought back to England from the battle fronts by her soldiers is that to the average Briton this a religious crusade, and men have gone with an exaltation of soul, willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, willing to die that the world might live. Men and women are face to face with eternal realities, and are driven by the needs of their hearts to the eternal refuge. Unless we see this we miss the most potent fact in the whole situation.  The tender stories in this little volume are a reflex of the great religious stirring of the nation. They describe in a gracious and pathetic way the various abysmal needs of this tragic time, and they indicate how many human souls are finding comfort and healing and strength. They are finding peace as of old, through the assurance that \"earth has no sorrows, that heaven cannot heal.\"  HUGH BLACK.  NEW YORK.     \"THE WHITE COMRADE\"   I     When soldiers of the Cross waged Holy War,   With courage high, and hearts that did not quail   Before the foe, in olden times they saw   The blessed vision of the Holy Grail.   Tho' Christ was gone, His pledge was with them yet,   For, borne on wings of angels, from the skies,   They saw the chalice that once held the wine   As emblem of the Saviour's sacrifice   For men, and knew that still the Master met,   With His own friends, in fellowship divine.   II     Christ has His soldiers now.   Though years have rolled   Away, the warriors of the Cross are strong   To fight His battles, as the saints of old,   Against oppression, tyranny, and wrong.   And still amid the conflict, they can trace   The Saviour's influence. Not the Holy Grail   Which once as His remembrance was adored,   But Christ Himself is with them. For a veil   Is lifted from their eyes, and, face to face   They meet the presence of the risen Lord.   III     O blessed vision! After all the years,   Thou'rt with us yet. To-day, as heretofore,   Men see Thee still and they cast off their fears,   And take fresh courage to press on once more.   The soldiers, bearing from the desperate fight   A wounded brother, see Thee, in the way,   And know Thee for the Saviour, Healer, Friend,   For once again, Thy loved ones hear Thee say   (O Christ! White Comrade, in their stand for right!)   \"Lo, I am with you alway, to the end.\"   _Fidei Defensor_.     CONTENTS   I.        IN THE TRENCHES  II.       THE MESSENGER  III.

They saved the British Army, but they saved it at fearful cost. No 'great host' withdrew from that field of destruction; the great host strewed the ground with their bodies. Only a remnant of those who stood in the actual furnace of Mons escaped with their lives ... Let those who mourn, take encouragement from these stories of visions on the battlefield, quietly and with a child's confidence, cultivate within themselves a waiting, receptive and desiring spirit. Let them empty themselves of prejudice and self.... Let them detach themselves more and more from the obsessions of worldly life. Serenity is the path by which the thoughts of God travel to us; and Faith is the invitation which brings them to the table of our souls.\"  --ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS.    IN THE TRENCHES  Strange tales reached us in the trenches. Rumours raced up and down that three-hundred-mile line from Switzerland to the sea. We knew neither the source of them nor the truth of them. They came quickly, and they went quickly. Yet somehow I remember the very hour when George Casey turned to me with a queer look in his blue eyes, and asked if I had seen the Friend of the Wounded.  And then he told me all he knew. After many a hot engagement a man in white had been seen bending over the wounded. Snipers sniped at him. Shells fell all around. Nothing had power to touch him. He was either heroic beyond all heroes, or he was something greater still. This mysterious one, whom the French called _The Comrade in White_, seemed to be everywhere at once. At Nancy, in the Argonne, at Soissons and Ypres, everywhere men were talking of him with hushed voices.  But some laughed and said the trenches were telling on men's nerves. I, who was often reckless enough in my talk, exclaimed that for me seeing was believing, and that I didn't expect any help but an enemy's knife if I was found lying out there wounded.  It was the next day that things got lively on this bit of the front. Our big guns roared from sunrise to sunset, and began again in the morning. At noon we got word to take the trenches in front of us. They were two hundred yards away, and we weren't well started till we knew that the big guns had failed in their work of preparation. It needed a stout heart to go on, but not a man wavered. We had advanced one hundred and fifty yards when we found it was no good. Our Captain called to us to take cover, and just then I was shot through both legs. By God's mercy I fell into a hole of some sort. I suppose I fainted, for when I opened my eyes I was all alone. The pain was horrible, but I didn't dare to move lest the enemy should see me, for they were only fifty yards away, and I did not expect mercy. I was glad when the twilight came. There were men in my own company who would run any risk in the darkness if they thought a comrade was still alive.  The night fell, and soon I heard a step, not stealthy, as I expected, but quiet and firm, as if neither darkness nor death could check those untroubled feet. So little did I guess what was coming that, even when I saw the gleam of white in the darkness, I thought it was a peasant in a white smock, or perhaps a woman deranged. Suddenly, with a little shiver of joy or of fear, I don't know which, I guessed that it was _The Comrade in White_. And at that very moment the enemy's rifles began to shoot. The bullets could scarcely miss such a target, for he flung out his arms as though in entreaty, and then drew them hack till he stood like one of those wayside crosses that we saw so often as we marched through France. And he spoke. The words sounded familiar, but all I remember was the beginning. \"If thou hadst known,\" and the ending, \"but now they are hid from thine eyes.\" And then he stooped and gathered me into his arms--me, the biggest man in the regiment--and carried me as if I had been a child.  I must have fainted again, for I woke to consciousness in a little cave by a stream, and _The Comrade in White_ was washing my wounds and binding them up. It seems foolish to say it, for I was in terrible pain, but I was happier at that moment than ever I remember to have been in all my life before. I can't explain it, but it seemed as if all my days I had been waiting for this without knowing it. As long as that hand touched me and those eyes pitied me, I did not seem to care any more about sickness or health, about life or death. And while he swiftly removed every trace of blood and mire I felt as if my whole nature were being washed, as if all the grime and soil of sin were going, and as if I were once more a little child.  I suppose I slept, for when I awoke this feeling was gone. I was a man, and I wanted to know what I could do for my friend to help him or to serve him. He was looking towards the stream, and his hands were clasped in prayer; and then I saw that he too had been wounded. I could see, as it were, a shot-wound in his hand, and as he prayed a drop of blood gathered and fell to the ground. I cried out. I could not help it, for that wound of his seemed to me a more awful thing than any that bitter war had shown me. \"You are wounded too,\" I said faintly. Perhaps he heard me, perhaps it was the look on my face, but he answered gently, \"This is an old wound, but it has troubled me of late.\" And then I noticed sorrowfully that the same cruel mark was on his feet. You will wonder that I did not know sooner. I wonder myself. But it was only when I saw His feet that I knew Him.  \"The Living Christ\"--I had heard the Chaplain speak of Him a few weeks before, but now I knew that He had come to me--to me who had put Him out of my life in the hot fever of my youth. I was longing to speak and to thank Him, but no words came. And then He rose swiftly and said, \"Lie here to-day by the water. I will come for you tomorrow. I have work for you to do, and you will do it for me.\"  In a moment He was gone. And while I wait for Him I write this down that I may not lose the memory of it. I feel weak and lonely and my pain increases, but I have His promise. I know that He will come for me to-morrow.     II.
