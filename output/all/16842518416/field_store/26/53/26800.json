Now that he was alone, for the first time since meeting Audrey Greyle on the beach, he was able to reflect on certain events of the afternoon in uninterrupted fashion. He thought over them as he walked back towards the \"Admiral's Arms.\" It was certainly a strange thing that Bassett Oliver, after remarking to the fisherman that he had known a Mr. Marston Greyle in America, and hearing that the Squire of Scarhaven had been in that country, should have gone up to the house saying that he would call on the Squire and should never have been seen again. It was certainly strange that if this Marston Greyle, of Scarhaven, had met Bassett Oliver in America he should have completely forgotten the fact. Bassett Oliver had a considerable reputation in the United States--he was, in fact, more popular in that country than in his own, and he had toured in the principal towns and cities across there regularly for several years. To meet him there was to meet a most popular celebrity--could any man forget it? Therefore, were there two men of the name of Marston Greyle?  That was one problem--closely affecting Oliver's disappearance. The other had nothing to do with Oliver's disappearance--nevertheless, it interested Richard Copplestone. He was a young man of quick perception and accurate observation, and his alert eyes had seen that the Squire of Scarhaven occupied a position suggestive of power and wealth. The house which stood beneath the old Keep was one of size and importance, the sort of place which could only be kept up by a rich man--Copplestone's glances at its grounds, its gardens, its entrance lodge, its entire surroundings had shown him that only a well-to-do man could live there. How came it, then, that the Squire's relations--his cousin and her mother--lived in a small and unpretentious cottage, and were obviously not well off as regards material goods? Copplestone had the faculty of seeing things at a glance, and refined and cultivated as the atmosphere of Mrs. Greyle's parlour was, it had taken no more than a glance from his perceptive eyes to see that he was there confronted with what folk call genteel poverty. Mrs. Greyle's almost nun-like attire of black had done duty for a long time; the carpet was threadbare; there was an absence of those little touches of comfort with which refined women of even modest means love to surround themselves; a sure instinct told him that here were two women who had to carefully count their pence, and lay out their shillings with caution. Genteel, quiet poverty, without doubt--and yet, on the other side of the little bay, a near kinsman whose rent-roll must run to a few thousands a year!  And yet one more curious occasion of perplexity--to add to the other two. Copplestone had felt instinctively attracted to Audrey Greyle when he met her on the sands, and the attraction increased as he walked at her side towards the village. In his quiet unobtrusive fashion he had watched her closely when they encountered the man whom she introduced as her cousin; and he had fancied that her manner underwent a curious change when Marston Greyle came on the scene--she had seemed to become constrained, chilled, distant, aloof--not with the stranger, himself, but with her kinsman. This fancy had become assurance during the conversation which had abruptly ended when Greyle took offence at Stafford's brusque remark. Copplestone had seen a sudden look in the girl's eyes when the fisherman repeated what Oliver had said about meeting a Mr. Marston Greyle in America; it was a look of sharply awakened--what? Suspicion? apprehension?--he could not decide. But it was the same look which had come into her mother's eyes later on. Moreover, when the Squire turned huffily away, taking his cousin with him, Copplestone had noticed that there was evidently a smart passage of words between them after leaving the little group on the quay, and they had parted unceremoniously, the man turning on his heel up a side path into his own grounds and the girl going forward with a sudden acceleration of pace. All this made Copplestone draw a conclusion.  \"There's no great love lost between the gentleman at the big house and his lady relatives in the little cottage,\" he mused. \"Also, around the gentleman there appears to be some cloud of mystery. What?--and has it anything to do with the Oliver mystery?\"  He went back to the inn and made his arrangements with its landlady, who by that time was full to overflowing with interest and amazement at the strange affair which had brought her this guest. But Mrs. Wooler had eyes as well as ears, and noticing that Copplestone was already looking weary and harassed, she hastened to provide a hot dinner for him, and to recommend a certain claret which in her opinion possessed remarkable revivifying qualities. Copplestone, who had eaten nothing for several hours, accepted her hospitable attentions with gratitude, and he was enjoying himself greatly in a quaint old-world parlour, in close proximity to a bright fire, when Mrs. Wooler entered with a countenance which betokened mystery in every feature.  \"There's the estate agent, Mr. Chatfield, outside, very anxious to have a word with you about this affair,\" she said. \"Would you be for having him in? He's the sort of man,\" she went on, sinking her tones to a whisper, \"who must know everything that's going on, and, of course, having the position he has, he might be useful. Mr. Peter Chatfield, Mr. Greyle's agent, and his uncle's before him--that's who he is--Peeping Peter, they call him hereabouts, because he's fond of knowing everybody's business.\"  \"Bring him in,\" said Copplestone. He was by no means averse to having a companion, and Mrs. Wooler's graphic characterization had awakened his curiosity. \"Tell him I shall be glad to see him.\"  Mrs. Wooler presently ushered in a figure which Copplestone's dramatic sense immediately seized on. He saw before him a tall, heavily-built man, with a large, solemn, deeply-lined face, out of which looked a pair of the smallest and slyest eyes ever seen in a human being--queer, almost hidden eyes, set beneath thick bushy eyebrows above which rose the dome of an unusually high forehead and a bald head. As for the rest of him, Mr. Peter Chatfield had a snub nose, a wide slit of a mouth, and a flabby hand; his garments were of a Quaker kind in cut and hue; he wore old-fashioned stand-up collars and a voluminous black stock; in one hand he carried a stout oaken staff, in the other a square-crowned beaver hat; altogether, his mere outward appearance would have gained notice for him anywhere, and Copplestone rejoiced in him as a character. He rose, greeted his visitor cordially, and invited him to a seat by the fire. The estate agent settled his heavy figure comfortably, and made a careful inspection of the young stranger before he spoke. At last he leaned forward.  \"Sir!\" he whispered in a confidential tone. \"Do you consider this here a matter of murder?\"     CHAPTER V  THE GREYLE HISTORY   If Copplestone had followed his first natural impulse, he would have laughed aloud at this solemnly propounded question: as it was, he found it difficult to content himself with a smile.  \"Isn't it a little early to arrive at any conclusion, of any sort, Mr. Chatfield?\" he asked. \"You haven't made up your own mind, surely?\" Chatfield pursed up his long thin lips and shook his head, continuing to stare fixedly at Copplestone.  \"Now I may have, and I may not have, mister,\" he said at last, suddenly relaxing. \"What I was asking of was--what might you consider?\"  \"I don't consider at all--yet,\" answered Copplestone. \"It's too soon. Let me offer you a glass of claret.\"  \"Many thanks to you, sir, but it's too cold for my stomach,\" responded the visitor. \"A drop of gin, now, is more in my line, since you're so kind. Ah, well, in any case, sir, this here is a very unfortunate affair. I'm a deal upset by it--I am indeed!\"  Copplestone rang the bell, gave orders for Mr. Chatfield's suitable entertainment with gin and cigars, and making an end of his dinner, drew up a chair to the fire opposite his visitor.  \"You are upset, Mr. Chatfield?\" he remarked. \"Now, why?\"  Chatfield sipped his gin and water, and flourished a cigar with a comprehensive wave of his big fat hand.  \"Oh, in general, sir!\" he said. \"Things like this here are not pleasant to have in a quiet, respectable community like ours. There's very wicked people in this world, mister, and they will not control what's termed the unruly member. They will talk. You'll excuse me, but I doubt not that I'm a good deal more than twice your age, and I've learnt experience. My experience, sir, is that a wise man holds his tongue until he's called upon to use it. Now, in my opinion, it was a very unwise thing of yon there sea-going man, Ewbank, to say that this unfortunate play-actor told him that he'd met our Squire in America--very unfortunate!\"  Copplestone pricked his ears. Had the estate agent come there to tell him that? And if so, why?  \"Oh!\" he said. \"You've heard that, have you? Now who told you that, Mr. Chatfield? For I don't think that's generally known.\"  \"If you knew this here village, mister, as well as what I do,\" replied Chatfield coolly, \"you'd know that there is known all over the place by this time. The constable told me, and of course yon there man, Ewbank, he'll have told it all round since he had that bit of talk with you and your friend. He'll have been in to every public there is in Scarhaven, repeating of it. And a very, very serious complexion, of course, could be put on them words, sir.\"  \"How?\" asked Copplestone.  \"Put it to yourself, sir,\" replied Chatfield. \"The unfortunate man comes here, tells Ewbank he knew Mr. Greyle in that far-away land, says he'll call on him, is seen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9807"],["title","Scarhaven Keep (#6)"],["body"," towards the big house--and is never seen no more! Why, sir, what does human nature--which is wicked--say?\"  \"What does your human nature--which I'm sure is not wicked, say?\" suggested Copplestone. \"Come, now!\"  \"What I say, sir, is neither here nor there,\" answered the agent. \"It's what evil-disposed tongues says.\"  \"But they haven't said anything yet,\" said Copplestone.  \"I should say they've said a deal, sir,\" responded Chatfield, lugubriously. \"I know Scarhaven tongues. They'll have thrown out a deal of suspicious talk about the Squire.\"  \"Have you seen Mr. Greyle?\" asked Copplestone. He was already sure that the agent was there with a purpose, and he wanted to know its precise nature. \"Is he concerned about this?\"  \"I have seen Mr. Greyle, mister, and he is concerned about what yon man, Ewbank, related,\" replied Chatfield. \"Mr. Greyle, sir, came straight to me--I reside in a residence within the park. Mr. Greyle, mister, says that he has no recollection whatever of meeting this play-actor person in America--he may have done and he mayn't. But he doesn't remember him, and it isn't likely he should--him, an English landlord and a gentleman wouldn't be very like to remember a play-actor person that's here today and gone tomorrow! I hope I give no offence, sir--maybe you're a play-actor yourself.\"  \"I am not,\" answered Copplestone. He sat staring at his visitor for awhile, and when he spoke again his voice had lost its cordial tone. \"Well,\" he said, \"and what have you called on me about?\"  Chatfield looked up sharply, noticing the altered tone.  \"To tell you--and them as you no doubt represent--that Mr. Greyle will be glad to help in any possible way towards finding out something in this here affair,\" he answered. \"He'll welcome any inquiry that's opened.\"  \"Oh!\" said Copplestone. \"I see! But you're making a mistake, Mr. Chatfield. I don't represent anybody. I'm not even a relation of Mr. Bassett Oliver. In fact, I never met Mr. Oliver in my life: never spoke to him. So--I'm not here in any representative or official sense.\"  Chatfield's small eyes grew smaller with suspicious curiosity.  \"Oh?\" he said questioningly. \"Then--what might you be here for, mister?\"  Copplestone stood up and rang the bell.  \"That's my business.\" he answered. \"Sorry I can't give you any more time,\" he went on as Mrs. Wooler opened the door. \"I'm engaged now. If you or Mr. Greyle want to see Mr. Oliver's friends I believe his brother, Sir Cresswell Oliver, will be here tomorrow--he's been wired for anyhow.\"  Chatfield's mouth opened as he picked up his hat. He stared at this self-assured young man as if he were something quite new to him.  \"Sir Cresswell Oliver!\" he exclaimed. \"Did you say, sir?\"  \"I said Sir Cresswell Oliver--quite plainly,\" answered Copplestone.  Chatfield's mouth grew wider.  \"You don't mean to tell me that a play-actor's own brother to a titled gentleman!\" he said.  \"Good-night!\" replied Copplestone, motioning his visitor towards the door. \"I can't give you any more time, really. However, as you seem anxious, Mr. Bassett Oliver is the younger brother of Rear-Admiral Sir Cresswell Oliver, Baronet, and I should imagine that Sir Cresswell will want to know a lot about what's become of him. So you'd better--or Mr. Greyle had better--speak to him. Now once more--good-night.\"  When Chatfield had gone, Copplestone laughed and flung himself into an easy chair before the fire. Of course, the stupid, ignorant, self-sufficient old fool had come fishing for news--he and his master wanted to know what was going to be done in the way of making inquiry. But why?--why so much anxiety if they knew nothing whatever about Bassett Oliver's strange disappearance? \"Why this profession of eager willingness to welcome any inquiry that might be made? Nobody had accused Marston Greyle of having anything to do with Bassett Oliver's strange exit--if it was an exit--why, then--  \"But it's useless speculating,\" he mused. \"I can't do anything--and here I am, with nothing to do!\"  He had pleaded an engagement, but he had none, of course. There was a shelf of old books in the room, but he did not care to read. And presently, hands in pockets, he lounged out into the hall and saw Mrs. Wooler standing at the door of the little parlour into which she had shown him and Stafford earlier in the day.  \"There's nobody in here, sir,\" she said, invitingly; \"if you'd like to smoke your pipe here--\"  \"Thank you--I will,\" answered Copplestone. \"I got rid of that old fellow,\" he observed confidentially when he had followed the landlady within, and had dropped into a chair near her own. \"I think he had come--fishing.\"  \"That's his usual occupation,\" said Mrs. Wooler, with a meaning smile. \"I told you he was called Peeping Peter. He's the sort of man who will have his nose in everybody's affairs. But,\" she added, with a shake of the head which seemed to mean a good deal more than the smile, \"he doesn't often come here. This is almost the only house in Scarhaven that doesn't belong to the Greyle estate. This house, and the land round it, have belonged to the Wooler family as long as the rest of the place has belonged to the Greyles. And many a Greyle has wanted to buy it, and every Wooler has refused to sell it--and always will!\"  \"That's very interesting,\" said Copplestone. \"Does the present Greyle want to buy?\"  The landlady picked up a piece of sewing and sat down in a chair which seemed to be purposely placed so that she could keep an eye on the adjacent bar-parlour on one side and the hall on the other.  \"I don't know much about what the present Squire would like,\" she said. \"Nobody does. He's a newcomer, and nobody knows anything about him. You saw him this afternoon?\"  \"I met a young lady on the sands who turned out to be his cousin, and he came up while I was talking to her,\" replied Copplestone. \"Yes, I saw him. I'm afraid Mr. Stafford, who came in here with me, you know, offended him,\" he continued, and gave Mrs. Wooler an account of what had happened. \"Is he rather--touchy?\" he concluded.  \"I don't know that he is,\" she said. \"No one sees much of him. You see he's a stranger: although he's a Greyle, he's not a Scarhaven man. Of course, I know all his family history--I'm Scarhaven born and bred. In my time there have been three generations of Greyles. The first one I knew was this Squire's grandfather, old Mr. Stephen Greyle: he died when I was a girl in my 'teens. He had three sons and no daughters. The three sons were all different in their tastes and ideas; the eldest, Stephen John, who came into the estates on his father's death, was a real home bird--he never left Scarhaven for more than a day or two at a time all his life. And he never married--he was a real old bachelor, almost a woman-hater. The next one, Marcus, went out to America and settled there--he was the father of this present Squire, Mr. Marston Greyle. Then there was the third son, Valentine--he went to live in London. And years after he came back here, very poor, and settled down in a little house near Scarhaven Church with his wife and daughter--that was the daughter you met this afternoon, Miss Audrey. I don't know why, and nobody else knows, either, but the last Squire, Stephen John, never had anything to do with Valentine and his family; what's more, when Valentine died and left the widow and daughter very poorly off, Stephen John did nothing for them. But he himself died very soon after Valentine, and then of course, as Marcus had already died in America, everything came to this Mr. Marston. And, as I said, he's a stranger to Scarhaven folk and Scarhaven ways. Indeed, you might say to England and English ways, for I understand he'd never been in England until he came to take up the family property.\"  \"Is he more friendly with the mother and daughter than the last Squire was?\" asked Copplestone, who had been much interested in this chapter of family history.  Mrs. Wooler made several stitches in her sewing before she answered this direct question, and when, she spoke it was in lower tones and with a glance of caution.  \"He would be, if he could!\" she said. \"There are those in the village who say that he wants to marry his cousin. But the truth is--so far as one can see or learn it--that for some reason or other, neither Mrs. Valentine Greyle nor Miss Audrey can bear him! They took some queer dislike to the young man when he first came, and they've kept it up. Of course, they're outwardly friendly, and he occasionally, I believe, goes to the cottage, but they rarely go to the big house, and it's very seldom they're ever seen together. I have heard--one does hear things in villages--that he'd be very glad to do something handsome for them, but they're both as proud as they're poor, and not the sort to accept aught from anybody. I believe they've just enough to live on, but it can't be a great deal, for everybody knows that Valentine Greyle made ducks and drakes of his fortune long before he came back to Scarhaven, and old Stephen John only left them a few hundreds of pounds. However--there it is. However much the new Squire wants to marry his cousin, it's very flat she'll not have anything to say to him. I've once or twice had an opportunity of seeing those two together, and it's my private opinion that Miss Audrey dislikes that young man just about as heartily as she possibly could!\"  \"What does Mr. Marston Greyle find to do with himself in this place?\" asked Copplestone, turning the conversation. \"Can't be very lively for him if he's a man of any activity.\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Mrs. Wooler. \"I think he's a good deal like his uncle, the last squire--he certainly never goes anywhere, except out to sea in his yacht. He shoots a bit, and fishes a bit, and so on, and spends a lot of time with Peeping Peter--he's a widower, is Chatfield, and lives alone, except when his daughter runs down to see him. And that daughter, bye-the-bye, Mr. Copplestone, is on the stage.\"  \"Dear me!"]]]
