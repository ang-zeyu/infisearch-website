And so passed the hours of that night; and the father and the child--the meek convert, the revengeful fanatic--were under the same roof.     CHAPTER IV.  ALMAMEN HEARS AND SEES, BUT REFUSES TO BELIEVE; FOR THE BRAIN, OVERWROUGHT, GROWS DULL, EVEN IN THE KEENEST.  The dawn broke slowly upon the chamber, and Almamen still slept.  It was the Sabbath of the Christians--that day on which the Saviour rose from the dead--thence named so emphatically and sublimely by the early Church THE LORD'S DAY.       [Before the Christian era, the Sunday was, however, called the      Lord's day--i.e., the day of the Lord the Sun.]  And as the ray of the sun flashed in the east it fell like a glory, over a crucifix, placed in the deep recess of the Gothic casement; and brought startlingly before the eyes of Leila that face upon which the rudest of the Catholic sculptors rarely fail to preserve the mystic and awful union of the expiring anguish of the man with the lofty patience of the God. It looked upon her, that face; it invited, it encouraged, while it thrilled and subdued.  She stole gently from the side of her father; she crept to the spot, and flung herself on her knees beside the consecrated image.  \"Support me, O Redeemer!\" she murmured--\"support thy creature! strengthen her steps in the blessed path, though it divide her irrevocably from all that on earth she loves: and if there be a sacrifice in her solemn choice, accept, O Thou, the Crucified! accept it, in part atonement of the crime of her stubborn race; and, hereafter, let the lips of a maiden of Judaea implore thee, not in vain, for some mitigation of the awful curse that hath fallen justly upon her tribe.\"  As broken by low sobs, and in a choked and muttered voice, Leila poured forth her prayer, she was startled by a deep groan; and turning, in alarm she saw that Almamen had awaked, and, leaning on his arm, was now bending upon her his dark eyes, once more gleaming with all their wonted fire.  \"Speak,\" he said, as she coweringly hid her face, \"speak to me, or I shall be turned to stone by one horrid thought.  It is not before that symbol that thou kneelest in adoration; and my sense wanders, if it tell me that thy broken words expressed the worship of an apostate?  In mercy, speak!\"  \"Father!\" began Leila; but her lips refused to utter more than that touching and holy word.  Almamen rose; and plucking the hands from her face, gazed on her some moments, as if he would penetrate her very soul; and Leila, recovering her courage in the pause, by degrees met his eyes unquailing--her pure and ingenuous brow raised to his, and sadness, but not guilt, speaking from every line of that lovely face.  \"Thou dost not tremble,\" said Almamen, at length, breaking the silence, \"and I have erred.  Thou art not the criminal I deemed thee.  Come to my arms!\"  \"Alas!\" said Leila, obeying the instinct, and casting herself upon that rugged bosom.  \"I will dare, at least, not to disavow my God.  Father! by that dread anathema which is on our race, which has made us homeless and powerless--outcasts and strangers in the land; by the persecution and anguish we have known, teach thy lordly heart that we are rightly punished for the persecution and the anguish we doomed to Him, whose footstep hallowed our native earth!  FIRST, IN THE HISTORY of THE WORLD, DID THE STERN HEBREWS INFLICT UPON MANKIND THE AWFUL CRIME OF PERSECUTION FOR OPINIONS SAKE.  The seed we sowed hath brought forth the Dead Sea fruit upon which we feed.  I asked for resignation and for hope: I looked upon yonder cross, and I found both.  Harden not thy heart; listen to thy child; wise though thou be, and weak though her woman spirit, listen to me.\"  \"Be dumb!\" cried Almamen, in such a voice as might have come from the charnel, so ghostly and deathly sounded its hollow tone; then, recoiling some steps, he placed both his hands upon his temples, and muttered, \"Mad, mad! yes, yes, this is but a delirium, and I am tempted with a devil!  Oh, my child!\" he resumed, in a voice that became, on the sudden, inexpressibly tender and imploring, \"I have been sorely tried; and I dreamt a feverish dream of passion and revenge.  Be thine the lips, and thine the soothing hand, that shall wake me from it.  Let us fly for ever from these hated lands; let us leave to these miserable infidels their bloody contest, careless which shall fall.  To a soil on which the iron heel does not clang, to an air where man's orisons rise, in solitude, to the Great Jehovah, let us hasten our weary steps.  Come! while the castle yet sleeps, let us forth unseen--the father and the child.  We will hold sweet commune by the way.  And hark ye, Leila,\" he added, in a low and abrupt whisper, \"talk not to me of yonder symbol; for thy God is a jealous God, and hath no likeness in the graven image.\"  Had he been less exhausted by long travail and racking thoughts, far different, perhaps, would have been the language of a man so stern.  But circumstance impresses the hardest substance; and despite his native intellect and affected superiority over others, no one, perhaps, was more human, in his fitful moods,--his weakness and his strength, his passion and his purpose,--than that strange man, who had dared, in his dark studies and arrogant self-will, to aspire beyond humanity.  That was, indeed, a perilous moment for the young convert.  The unexpected softness of her father utterly subdued her; nor was she sufficiently possessed of that all-denying zeal of the Catholic enthusiast to which every human tie and earthly duty has been often sacrificed on the shrine of a rapt and metaphysical piety.  Whatever her opinions, her new creed, her secret desire of the cloister, fed as it was by the sublime, though fallacious notion, that in her conversion, her sacrifice, the crimes of her race might be expiated in the eyes of Him whose death had been the great atonement of a world; whatever such higher thoughts and sentiments, they gave way, at that moment, to the irresistible impulse of household nature and of filial duty.  Should she desert her father, and could that desertion be a virtue?  Her heart put and answered both questions in a breath.  She approached Almamen, placed her hand in his, and said, steadily and calmly, \"Father, wheresoever thou goest, I will wend with thee.\"  But Heaven ordained to each another destiny than might have been theirs, had the dictates of that impulse been fulfilled.  Ere Almamen could reply, a trumpet sounded clear and loud at the gate.  \"Hark!\" he said, griping his dagger, and starting back to a sense of the dangers round him.  \"They come--my pursuers and my murtherers!--but these limbs are sacred from--the rack.\"  Even that sound of ominous danger was almost a relief to Leila: \"I will go,\" she said, \"and learn what the blast betokens; remain here--be cautious--I will return.\"  Several minutes, however, elapsed before Leila reappeared; she was accompanied by Donna Inez, whose paleness and agitation betokened her alarm.  A courier had arrived at the gate to announce the approach of the queen, who, with a considerable force, was on her way to join Ferdinand, then, in the usual rapidity of his movements, before one of the Moorish towns that had revolted from his allegiance.  It was impossible for Almamen to remain in safety in the castle; and the only hope of escape was departing immediately and in disguise.  \"I have,\" she said, \"a trusty and faithful servant with me in the castle, to whom I can, without anxiety, confide the charge of your safety; and even if suspected by the way, my name, and the companionship of my servant, will remove all obstacles; it is not a long journey hence to Guadix, which has already revolted to the Moors: there, till the armies of Ferdinand surround the walls, your refuge may be secure.\"  Almamen remained for some moments plunged in a gloomy silence.  But, at length, he signified his assent to the plan proposed, and Donna Inez hastened to give the directions of his intended guide.  \"Leila,\" said the Hebrew, when left alone with his daughter, \"think not that it is for mine own safety that I stoop to this flight from thee. No! but never till thou wert lost to me, by mine own rash confidence in another, did I know how dear to my heart was the last scion of my race, the sole memorial left to me of thy mother's love.  Regaining thee once more, a new and a soft existence opens upon my eyes; and the earth seems to change, as by a sudden revolution, from winter into spring.  For thy sake, I consent to use all the means that man's intellect can devise for preservation from my foes.  Meanwhile, here will rest my soul; to this spot, within one week from this period--no matter through what danger I pass--I shall return: then I shall claim thy promise.  I will arrange all things for our flight, and no stone shall harm thy footstep by the way. The Lord of Israel be with thee, my daughter, and strengthen thy heart! But,\" he added, tearing himself from her embrace, as he heard steps ascending to the chamber, \"deem not that, in this most fond and fatherly affection, I forget what is due to me and thee.  Think not that my love is only the brute and insensate feeling of the progenitor to the offspring: I love thee for thy mother's sake--I love thee for thine own-- I love thee yet more for the sake of Israel.  If thou perish, if thou art lost to us, thou, the last daughter of the house of Issachar, then the haughtiest family of God's great people is extinct.\"  Here Inez appeared at the door, but withdrew, at the impatient and lordly gesture of Almamen, who, without further heed of the interruption, resumed:  \"I look to thee, and thy seed, for the regeneration which I once trusted, fool that I was, mine own day might see effected.  Let this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9759"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book IV. (#4)"],["body","ss.  Thou art under the roof of the Nazarene.  I will not believe that the arts we have resisted against fire and sword can prevail with thee.  But, if I err, awful will be the penalty!  Could I once know that thou hadst forsaken thy ancestral creed, though warrior and priest stood by thee, though thousands and ten thousands were by thy right hand, this steel should save the race of Issachar from dishonour.  Beware!  Thou weepest; but, child, I warn, not threaten.  God be with thee!\"  He wrung the cold hand of his child, turned to the door, and, after such disguise as the brief time allowed him could afford, quitted the castle with his Spanish guide, who, accustomed to the benevolence of his mistress, obeyed her injunction without wonder, though not without suspicion.  The third part of an hour had scarcely elapsed, and the sun was yet on the mountain-tops, when Isabel arrived.  She came to announce that the outbreaks of the Moorish towns in the vicinity rendered the half- fortified castle of her friend no longer a secure abode; and she honoured the Spanish lady with a command to accompany her, with her female suite, to the camp of Ferdinand.  Leila received the intelligence with a kind of stupor.  Her interview with her father, the strong and fearful contests of emotion which that interview occasioned, left her senses faint and dizzy; and when she found herself, by the twilight star, once more with the train of Isabel, the only feeling that stirred actively through her stunned and bewildered mind, was, that the hand of Providence conducted her from a temptation that, the Reader of all hearts knew, the daughter and woman would have been too feeble to resist.  On the fifth day from his departure, Almamen returned to find the castle deserted, and his daughter gone.     CHAPTER V.  IN THE FERMENT OF GREAT EVENTS THE DREGS RISE.  The Israelites did not limit their struggles to the dark conspiracy to which allusion has been made.  In some of the Moorish towns that revolted from Ferdinand, they renounced the neutrality they had hitherto maintained between Christian and Moslem.  Whether it was that they were inflamed by the fearful and wholesale barbarities enforced by Ferdinand and the Inquisition against their tribe, or whether they were stirred up by one of their own order, in whom was recognised the head of their most sacred family; or whether, as is most probable, both causes combined-- certain it is, that they manifested a feeling that was thoroughly unknown to the ordinary habits and policy of that peaceable people.  They bore great treasure to the public stock--they demanded arms, and, under their own leaders, were admitted, though with much jealousy and precaution, into the troops of the arrogant and disdainful Moslems.  In this conjunction of hostile planets, Ferdinand had recourse to his favourite policy of wile and stratagem.  Turning against the Jews the very treaty Almamen had once sought to obtain in their favour, he caused it to be circulated, privately, that the Jews, anxious to purchase their peace with him, had promised to betray the Moorish towns, and Granada itself into his hands.  The paper, which Ferdinand himself had signed in his interview with Almamen, and of which, on the capture of the Hebrew, he had taken care to repossess himself, he gave to a spy whom he sent, disguised as a Jew, into one of the revolted cities.  Private intelligence reached the Moorish ringleader of the arrival of this envoy.  He was seized, and the document found on his person.  The form of the words drawn up by Almamen (who had carefully omitted mention of his own name--whether that which he assumed, or that which, by birth, he should have borne) merely conveyed the compact, that if by a Jew, within two weeks from the date therein specified, Granada was delivered to the Christian king, the Jews should enjoy certain immunities and rights.  The discovery of this document filled the Moors of the city to which the spy had been sent with a fury that no words can describe.  Always distrusting their allies, they now imagined they perceived the sole reason of their sudden enthusiasm, of their demand for arms.  The mob rose: the principal Jews were seized and massacred without trial; some by the wrath of the multitude, some by the slower tortures of the magistrate.  Messengers were sent to the different revolted towns, and, above all, to Granada itself, to put the Moslems on their guard against these unhappy enemies of either party.  At once covetous and ferocious, the Moors rivalled the Inquisition in their cruelty, and Ferdinand in their extortion.  It was the dark fate of Almamen, as of most premature and heated liberators of the enslaved, to double the terrors and the evils he had sought to cure.  The warning arrived at Granada at a time in which the vizier, Jusef, had received the commands of his royal master, still at the siege of Salobrena, to use every exertion to fill the wasting treasuries.  Fearful of new exactions against the Moors, the vizier hailed, as a message from Heaven, so just a pretext for a new and sweeping impost on the Jews.  The spendthrift violence of the mob was restrained, because it was headed by the authorities, who were wisely anxious that the state should have no rival in the plunder it required; and the work of confiscation and robbery was carried on with a majestic and calm regularity, which redounded no less to the credit of Jusef than it contributed to the coffers of the king.  It was late, one evening, when Ximen was making his usual round through the chambers of Almamen's house.  As he glanced around at the various articles of wealth and luxury, he ever and anon burst into a low, fitful chuckle, rubbed his lean hands, and mumbled out, \"If my master should die! if my master should die!\"  While thus engaged, he heard a confused and distant shout; and, listening attentively, he distinguished a cry, grown of late sufficiently familiar, of, \"Live, Jusef the just--perish, the traitor Jews!\"  \"Ah!\" said Ximen, as the whole character of his face changed; \"some new robbery upon our race!  And this is thy work, son of Issachar!  Madman that thou wert, to be wiser than thy sires, and seek to dupe the idolaters in the council chamber and the camp--their field, their vantage ground; as the bazaar and the market-place are ours.  None suspect that the potent santon is the traitor Jew; but I know it!  I could give thee to the bow-string--and, if thou Overt dead, all thy goods and gold, even to the mule at the manger, would be old Ximen's.\"  He paused at that thought, shut his eyes, and smiled at the prospect his fancy conjured up and completing his survey, retired to his own chamber, which opened, by a small door, upon one of the back courts.  He had scarcely reached the room, when he heard a low tap at the outer door; and, when it was thrice repeated, he knew that it was one of his Jewish- brethren.  For Ximen--as years, isolation, and avarice gnawed away whatever of virtue once put forth some meagre fruit from a heart naturally bare and rocky--still reserved one human feeling towards his countrymen.  It was the bond which unites all the persecuted: and Ximen loved them, because he could not envy their happiness.  The power--the knowledge--the lofty, though wild designs of his master, stung and humbled him--he secretly hated, because he could not compassionate or contemn him.  But the bowed frame, and slavish voice, and timid nerves of his crushed brotherhood presented to the old man the likeness of things that could not exult over him.  Debased and aged, and solitary as he was, he felt a kind of wintry warmth in the thought that even he had the power to protect!  He thus maintained an intercourse with his fellow Israelites; and often, in their dangers, had afforded them a refuge in the numerous vaults and passages, the ruins of which may still be descried beneath the mouldering foundations of that mysterious mansion.  And, as the house was generally supposed the property of an absent emir, and had been especially recommended to the care of the cadis by Boabdil, who alone of the Moors knew it as one of the dwelling-places of the santon, whose ostensible residence was in apartments allotted to him within the palace,--it was, perhaps, the sole place within Granada which afforded an unsuspected and secure refuge to the hunted Israelites.  When Ximen recognised the wonted signal of his brethren, he crawled to the door; and, after the precaution of a Hebrew watchword, replied to in the same tongue, he gave admittance to the tall and stooping frame of the rich Elias.  \"Worthy and excellent master!\" said Ximen, after again securing the entrance; \"what can bring the honoured and wealthy Elias to the chamber of the poor hireling?\"  \"My friend,\" answered the Jew; \"call me not wealthy, nor honoured.  For years I have dwelt within the city; safe and respected, even by the Moslemin; verily and because I have purchased with jewel and treasure the protection of the king and the great men.  But now, alas! in the sudden wrath of the heathen--ever imagining vain things--I have been summoned into the presence of their chief rabbi, and only escaped the torture by a sum that ten years of labour and the sweat of my brow cannot replace. Ximen! the bitterest thought of all is, that the frenzy of one of our own tribe has brought this desolation upon Israel.\"  \"My lord speaks riddles,\" said Ximen, with well-feigned astonishment in his glassy eyes.  \"Why dost thou wind and turn, good Ximen?\" said the Jew, shaking his head; \"thou knowest well what my words drive at.  Thy master is the pretended Almamen; and that recreant Israelite (if Israelite, indeed, still be one who hath forsaken the customs and the forms of his forefathers) is he who hath stirred up the Jews of Cordova and Guadix, and whose folly hath brought upon us these dread things.  Holy Abraham! this Jew hath cost me more than fifty Nazarenes and a hundred Moors.\""]]]
