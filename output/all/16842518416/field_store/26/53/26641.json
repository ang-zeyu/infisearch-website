Betsy still had her mule, Hank, and Button-Bright and the Wizard could sit together upon the long, thin back of the Sawhorse, but they took care to soften their seat with a pad of blankets before they started.  Thus mounted, the adventurers started for the hill, which was reached after a brief journey.  As they mounted the crest and gazed beyond the hill, they discovered not far away a walled city, from the towers and spires of which gay banners were flying.  It was not a very big city, indeed, but its walls were very high and thick, and it appeared that the people who lived there must have feared attack by a powerful enemy, else they would not have surrounded their dwellings with so strong a barrier. There was no path leading from the mountains to the city, and this proved that the people seldom or never visited the whirling hills, but our friends found the grass soft and agreeable to travel over, and with the city before them they could not well lose their way.  When they drew nearer to the walls, the breeze carried to their ears the sound of music--dim at first, but growing louder as they advanced.  \"That doesn't seem like a very terr'ble place,\" remarked Dorothy.  \"Well, it LOOKS all right,\" replied Trot from her seat on the Woozy, \"but looks can't always be trusted.\"  \"MY looks can,\" said Scraps.  \"I LOOK patchwork, and I AM patchwork, and no one but a blind owl could ever doubt that I'm the Patchwork Girl.\"  Saying which, she turned a somersault off the Woozy and, alighting on her feet, began wildly dancing about.  \"Are owls ever blind?\" asked Trot.  \"Always, in the daytime,\" said Button-Bright.   \"But Scraps can see with her button eyes both day and night.  Isn't it queer?\"  \"It's queer that buttons can see at all,\" answered Trot.  \"But good gracious!  What's become of the city?\"  \"I was going to ask that myself,\" said Dorothy. \"It's gone!\"  \"It's gone!\"  The animals came to a sudden halt, for the city had really disappeared, walls and all, and before them lay the clear, unbroken sweep of the country.  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the Wizard.  \"This is rather disagreeable.  It is annoying to travel almost to a place and then find it is not there.\"  \"Where can it be, then?\" asked Dorothy.  \"It cert'nly was there a minute ago.\"  \"I can hear the music yet,\" declared Button-Bright, and when they all listened, the strains of music could plainly be heard.  \"Oh!  There's the city over at the left,\" called Scraps, and turning their eyes, they saw the walls and towers and fluttering banners far to the left of them.  \"We must have lost our way,\" suggested Dorothy.  \"Nonsense,\" said the Lion.  \"I, and all the other animals, have been tramping straight toward the city ever since we first saw it.\"  \"Then how does it happen--\"  \"Never mind,\" interrupted the Wizard, \"we are no farther from it than we were before.  It is in a different direction, that's all, so let us hurry and get there before it again escapes us.\"  So on they went directly toward the city, which seemed only a couple of miles distant.  But when they had traveled less than a mile, it suddenly disappeared again.  Once more they paused, somewhat discouraged, but in a moment the button eyes of Scraps again discovered the city, only this time it was just behind them in the direction from which they had come.  \"Goodness gracious!\" cried Dorothy.  \"There's surely something wrong with that city.  Do you s'pose it's on wheels, Wizard?\"  \"It may not be a city at all,\" he replied, looking toward it with a speculative glance.  \"What COULD it be, then?\"  \"Just an illusion.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Trot.  \"Something you think you see and don't see.\"  \"I can't believe that,\" said Button-Bright.  \"If we only saw it, we might be mistaken, but if we can see it and hear it, too, it must be there.\"  \"Where?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.  \"Somewhere near us,\" he insisted.  \"We will have to go back, I suppose,\" said the Woozy with a sigh.  So back they turned and headed for the walled city until it disappeared again, only to reappear at the right of them.  They were constantly getting nearer to it, however, so they kept their faces turned toward it as it flitted here and there to all points of the compass. Presently the Lion, who was leading the procession, halted abruptly and cried out, \"Ouch!\"  \"What's the matter?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Ouch--Ouch!\" repeated the Lion, and leaped backward so suddenly that Dorothy nearly tumbled from his back. At the same time Hank the Mule yelled \"Ouch!\"  \"Ouch!  Ouch!\" repeated the Lion and leaped backward so suddenly that Dorothy nearly tumbled from his back.  At the same time, Hank the Mule yelled \"Ouch!\" almost as loudly as the Lion had done, and he also pranced backward a few paces.  \"It's the thistles,\" said Betsy.  \"They prick their legs.\"  Hearing this, all looked down, and sure enough the ground was thick with thistles, which covered the plain from the point where they stood way up to the walls of the mysterious city.  No pathways through them could be seen at all; here the soft grass ended and the growth of thistles began.  \"They're the prickliest thistles I ever felt,\" grumbled the Lion.  \"My legs smart yet from their stings, though I jumped out of them as quickly as I could.\"  \"Here is a new difficulty,\" remarked the Wizard in a grieved tone. \"The city has stopped hopping around, it is true, but how are we to get to it over this mass of prickers?\"  \"They can't hurt ME,\" said the thick-skinned Woozy, advancing fearlessly and trampling among the thistles.  \"Nor me,\" said the Wooden Sawhorse.  \"But the Lion and the Mule cannot stand the prickers,\" asserted Dorothy, \"and we can't leave them behind.\"  \"Must we all go back?\" asked Trot.  \"Course not!\" replied Button-Bright scornfully. \"Always when there's trouble, there's a way out of it if you can find it.\"  \"I wish the Scarecrow was here,\" said Scraps, standing on her head on the Woozy's square back.  \"His splendid brains would soon show us how to conquer this field of thistles.\"  \"What's the matter with YOUR brains?\" asked the boy.  \"Nothing,\" she said, making a flip-flop into the thistles and dancing among them without feeling their sharp points.  \"I could tell you in half a minute how to get over the thistles if I wanted to.\"  \"Tell us, Scraps!\" begged Dorothy.  \"I don't want to wear my brains out with overwork,\" replied the Patchwork Girl.  \"Don't you love Ozma?  And don't you want to find her?\" asked Betsy reproachfully.  \"Yes indeed,\" said Scraps, walking on her hands as an acrobat does at the circus.  \"Well, we can't find Ozma unless we get past these thistles,\" declared Dorothy.  Scraps danced around them two or three times without reply.  Then she said, \"Don't look at me, you stupid folks.  Look at those blankets.\"  The Wizard's face brightened at once.  \"Why didn't we think of those blankets before?\"  \"Because you haven't magic brains,\" laughed Scraps.   \"Such brains as you have are of the common sort that grow in your heads, like weeds in a garden.  I'm sorry for you people who have to be born in order to be alive.\"  But the Wizard was not listening to her.  He quickly removed the blankets from the back of the Sawhorse and spread one of them upon the thistles, just next the grass.  The thick cloth rendered the prickers harmless, so the Wizard walked over this first blanket and spread the second one farther on, in the direction of the phantom city.  \"These blankets,\" said he, \"are for the Lion and the Mule to walk upon.  The Sawhorse and the Woozy can walk on the thistles.\"  So the Lion and the Mule walked over the first blanket and stood upon the second one until the Wizard had picked up the one they had passed over and spread it in front of them, when they advanced to that one and waited while the one behind them was again spread in front.  \"This is slow work,\" said the Wizard, \"but it will get us to the city after a while.\"  \"The city is a good half mile away yet,\" announced Button-Bright.  \"And this is awful hard work for the Wizard,\" added Trot.  \"Why couldn't the Lion ride on the Woozy's back?\" asked Dorothy. \"It's a big, flat back, and the Woozy's mighty strong. Perhaps the Lion wouldn't fall off.\"  \"You may try it if you like,\" said the Woozy to the Lion.  \"I can take you to the city in a jiffy and then come back for Hank.\"  \"I'm--I'm afraid,\" said the Cowardly Lion.  He was twice as big as the Woozy.  \"Try it,\" pleaded Dorothy.  \"And take a tumble among the thistles?\" asked the Lion reproachfully.  But when the Woozy came close to him, the big beast suddenly bounded upon its back and managed to balance himself there, although forced to hold his four legs so close together that he was in danger of toppling over.  The great weight of the monster Lion did not seem to affect the Woozy, who called to his rider, \"Hold on tight!\" and ran swiftly over the thistles toward the city.  The others stood on the blanket and watched the strange sight anxiously.  Of course, the Lion couldn't \"hold on tight\" because there was nothing to hold to, and he swayed from side to side as if likely to fall off any moment.  Still, he managed to stick to the Woozy's back until they were close to the walls of the city, when he leaped to the ground.  Next moment the Woozy came dashing back at full speed.  \"There's a little strip of ground next the wall where there are no thistles,\" he told them when he had reached the adventurers once more. \"Now then, friend Hank, see if you can ride as well as the Lion did.\"  \"Take the others first,\" proposed the Mule.  So the Sawhorse and the Woozy made a couple of trips over the thistles to the city walls and carried all the people in safety, Dorothy holding little Toto in her arms.  The travelers then sat in a group on a little hillock just outside the wall and looked at the great blocks of gray stone and waited for the Woozy to bring Hank to them.

Beads of perspiration followed the seams of his high, wrinkled forehead, replacing the tears which might have lessened the pressure upon his overwrought nerves. His slender frame shook, as with ague, and at times was racked by a convulsive shudder. A sudden step upon the stairway leading to his workshop brought him trembling and wide eyed to his feet, staring fearfully at the locked and bolted door.  Although he knew perfectly well whose the advancing footfalls were, he was all but overcome by the madness of apprehension as they came softly nearer and nearer to the barred door. At last they halted before it, to be followed by a gentle knock.  “Daddy!” came the sweet tones of a girl’s voice.  The man made an effort to take a firm grasp upon himself that no tell-tale evidence of his emotion might be betrayed in his speech.  “Daddy!” called the girl again, a trace of anxiety in her voice this time. “What _is_ the matter with you, and what _are_ you doing? You’ve been shut up in that hateful old room for three days now without a morsel to eat, and in all likelihood without a wink of sleep. You’ll kill yourself with your stuffy old experiments.”  The man’s face softened.  “Don’t worry about me, sweetheart,” he replied in a well controlled voice. “I’ll soon be through now—soon be through—and then we’ll go away for a long vacation—for a long vacation.”  “I’ll give you until noon, Daddy,” said the girl in a voice which carried a more strongly defined tone of authority than her father’s soft drawl, “and then I shall come into that room, if I have to use an axe, and bring you out—do you understand?”  Professor Maxon smiled wanly. He knew that his daughter was equal to her threat.  “All right, sweetheart, I’ll be through by noon for sure—by noon for sure. Run along and play now, like a good little girl.”  Virginia Maxon shrugged her shapely shoulders and shook her head hopelessly at the forbidding panels of the door.  “My dolls are all dressed for the day,” she cried, “and I’m tired of making mud pies—I want you to come out and play with me.” But Professor Maxon did not reply—he had returned to view his grim operations, and the hideousness of them had closed his ears to the sweet tones of the girl’s voice.  As she turned to retrace her steps to the floor below Miss Maxon still shook her head.  “Poor old Daddy,” she mused, “were I a thousand years old, wrinkled and toothless, he would still look upon me as his baby girl.”  If you chance to be an alumnus of Cornell you may recall Professor Arthur Maxon, a quiet, slender, white-haired gentleman, who for several years was an assistant professor in one of the departments of natural science. Wealthy by inheritance, he had chosen the field of education for his life work solely from a desire to be of some material benefit to mankind since the meager salary which accompanied his professorship was not of sufficient import to influence him in the slightest degree.  Always keenly interested in biology, his almost unlimited means had permitted him to undertake, in secret, a series of daring experiments which had carried him so far in advance of the biologists of his day that he had, while others were still groping blindly for the secret of life, actually reproduced by chemical means the great phenomenon.  Fully alive to the gravity and responsibilities of his marvellous discovery he had kept the results of his experimentation, and even the experiments themselves, a profound secret not only from his colleagues, but from his only daughter, who heretofore had shared his every hope and aspiration.  It was the very success of his last and most pretentious effort that had placed him in the horrifying predicament in which he now found himself—with the corpse of what was apparently a human being in his workshop and no available explanation that could possibly be acceptable to a matter-of-fact and unscientific police.  Had he told them the truth they would have laughed at him. Had he said: “This is not a human being that you see, but the remains of a chemically produced counterfeit created in my own laboratory,” they would have smiled, and either hanged him or put him away with the other criminally insane.  This phase of the many possibilities which he had realized might be contingent upon even the partial success of his work alone had escaped his consideration, so that the first wave of triumphant exultation with which he had viewed the finished result of this last experiment had been succeeded by overwhelming consternation as he saw the thing which he had created gasp once or twice with the feeble spark of life with which he had endowed it, and expire—leaving upon his hands the corpse of what was, to all intent and purpose, a human being, albeit a most grotesque and misshapen thing.  Until nearly noon Professor Maxon was occupied in removing the remaining stains and evidences of his gruesome work, but when he at last turned the key in the door of his workshop it was to leave behind no single trace of the successful result of his years of labor.  The following afternoon found him and Virginia crossing the station platform to board the express for New York. So quietly had their plans been made that not a friend was at the train to bid them farewell—the scientist felt that he could not bear the strain of attempting explanations at this time.  But there were those there who recognized them, and one especially who noted the lithe, trim figure and beautiful face of Virginia Maxon though he did not know even the name of their possessor. It was a tall well built young man who nudged one of his younger companions as the girl crossed the platform to enter her Pullman.  “I say, Dexter,” he exclaimed, “who is that beauty?”  The one addressed turned in the direction indicated by his friend.  “By jove!” he exclaimed. “Why it’s Virginia Maxon and the professor, her father. Now where do you suppose they’re going?”  “I don’t know—now,” replied the first speaker, Townsend J. Harper, Jr., in a half whisper, “but I’ll bet you a new car that I find out.”  A week later, with failing health and shattered nerves, Professor Maxon sailed with his daughter for a long ocean voyage, which he hoped would aid him in rapid recuperation, and permit him to forget the nightmare memory of those three horrible days and nights in his workshop.  He believed that he had reached an unalterable decision never again to meddle with the mighty, awe inspiring secrets of creation; but with returning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent triumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation.  The morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise of the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing desire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had crowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with pride to the scientific world.  His recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither Ithaca nor any other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his experiments, but it was not until their cruising had brought them among the multitudinous islands of the East Indies that the plan occurred to him that he finally adopted—a plan the outcome of which could he then have foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his own country with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the horrors it entailed.  They were steaming up the China Sea when the idea first suggested itself, and as he sat idly during the long, hot days the thought grew upon him, expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities, until it became crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession.  The result was that at Manila, much to Virginia’s surprise, he announced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage, taking immediate return passage to Singapore. His daughter did not question him as to the cause of this change in plans, for since those three days that her father had kept himself locked in his workroom at home the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent—a marked disinclination to share with her his every confidence as had been his custom since the death of her mother.  While it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt to sue for a reestablishment of the old relations. On all other topics than his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly, but by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo. And so it was that they came to Singapore without the girl having the slightest conception of her father’s plans.  Here they spent nearly a month, during which time Professor Maxon was daily engaged in interviewing officials, English residents and a motley horde of Malays and Chinamen.  Virginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was engaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a hint of the purpose of the month’s activity. When Virginia was present the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her father’s immediate future, and she was not long in discerning that it was in no sense through accident that this was true. Thereafter her wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep her in ignorance."]]]
