A blue smoke curling lazily from the stone chimney of his cabin, showed that Sam had made the kitchen fire, and a little later a rich, savory odor gave pleasing evidence that his wife was cooking breakfast.  \"Any sign of Jack?\" a voice called from the open door, and Betty appeared.  \"Nary sign.\"  \"Of the Indians, then?\"  \"Well, Betts, they left you a token of their regard,\" and Colonel Zane smiled as he took a broken halter from the fence.  \"Madcap?\" cried Betty.  \"Yes, they've taken Madcap and Bess.\"  \"Oh, the villains! Poor pony,\" exclaimed Betty indignantly. \"Eb, I'll coax Wetzel to fetch the pony home if he has to kill every Shawnee in the valley.\"  \"Now you're talking, Betts,\" Colonel Zane replied. \"If you could get Lew to do that much, you'd be blessed from one end of the border to the other.\"  He walked up the road; then back, keeping a sharp lookout on all sides, and bestowing a particularly keen glance at the hillside across the ravine, but could see no sign of the bordermen. As it was now broad daylight he felt convinced that further watch was unnecessary, and went in to breakfast. When he came out again the villagers were astir. The sharp strokes of axes rang out on the clear morning air, and a mellow anvil-clang pealed up from the blacksmith shop. Colonel Zane found his brother Silas and Jim Douns near the gate.  \"Morning, boys,\" he cried cheerily.  \"Any glimpse of Jack or Lew?\" asked Silas.  \"No; but I'm expecting one of 'em any moment.\"  \"How about the Indians?\" asked Douns. \"Silas roused me out last night; but didn't stay long enough to say more than 'Indians.'\"  \"I don't know much more than Silas. I saw several of the red devils who stole the horses; but how many, where they've gone, or what we're to expect, I can't say. We've got to wait for Jack or Lew. Silas, keep the garrison in readiness at the fort, and don't allow a man, soldier or farmer, to leave the clearing until further orders. Perhaps there were only three of those Shawnees, and then again the woods might have been full of them. I take it something's amiss, or Jack and Lew would be in by now.\"  \"Here come Sheppard and his girl,\" said Silas, pointing down the lane. \"'Pears George is some excited.\"  Colonel Zane had much the same idea as he saw Sheppard and his daughter. The old man appeared in a hurry, which was sufficient reason to believe him anxious or alarmed, and Helen looked pale.  \"Ebenezer, what's this I hear about Indians?\" Sheppard asked excitedly. \"What with Helen's story about the fort being besieged, and this brother of yours routing honest people from their beds, I haven't had a wink of sleep. What's up? Where are the redskins?\"  \"Now, George, be easy,\" said Colonel Zane calmly. \"And you, Helen, mustn't be frightened. There's no danger. We did have a visit from Indians last night; but they hurt no one, and got only two horses.\"  \"Oh, I'm so relieved that it's not worse,\" said Helen.  \"It's bad enough, Helen,\" Betty cried, her black eyes flashing, \"my pony Madcap is gone.\"  \"Colonel Zane, come here quick!\" cried Douns, who stood near the gate.  With one leap Colonel Zane was at the gate, and, following with his eyes the direction indicated by Douns' trembling finger, he saw two tall, brown figures striding down the lane. One carried two rifles, and the other a long bundle wrapped in a blanket.  \"It's Jack and Wetzel,\" whispered Colonel Zane to Jim. \"They've got the girl, and by God! from the way that bundle hangs, I think she's dead. Here,\" he added, speaking loudly, \"you women get into the house.\"  Mrs. Zane, Betty and Helen stared.  \"Go into the house!\" he cried authoritatively.  Without a protest the three women obeyed.  At that moment Nellie Douns came across the lane; Sam shuffled out from the backyard, and Sheppard arose from his seat on the steps. They joined Colonel Zane, Silas and Jim at the gate.  \"I wondered what kept you so late,\" Colonel Zane said to Jonathan, as he and his companion came up. \"You've fetched Mabel, and she's----\". The good man could say no more. If he should live an hundred years on the border amid savage murderers, he would still be tender-hearted. Just now he believed the giant borderman by the side of Jonathan held a dead girl, one whom he had danced, when a child, upon his knee.  \"Mabel, an' jest alive,\" replied Jonathan.  \"By God! I'm glad!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane. \"Here, Lew, give her to me.\"  Wetzel relinquished his burden to the colonel.  \"Lew, any bad Indian sign?\" asked Colonel Zane as he turned to go into the house.  The borderman shook his head.  \"Wait for me,\" added the colonel.  He carried the girl to that apartment in the cabin which served the purpose of a sitting-room, and laid her on a couch. He gently removed the folds of the blanket, disclosing to view a fragile, white-faced girl.  \"Bess, hurry, hurry!\" he screamed to his wife, and as she came running in, followed no less hurriedly by Betty, Helen and Nellie, he continued, \"Here's Mabel Lane, alive, poor child; but in sore need of help. First see whether she has any bodily injury. If a bullet must be cut out, or a knife-wound sewed up, it's better she remained unconscious. Betty, run for Bess's instruments, and bring brandy and water. Lively now!\" Then he gave vent to an oath and left the room.  Helen, her heart throbbing wildly, went to the side of Mrs. Zane, who was kneeling by the couch. She saw a delicate girl, not over eighteen years old, with a face that would have been beautiful but for the set lips, the closed eyelids, and an expression of intense pain.  \"Oh! Oh!\" breathed Helen.  \"Nell, hand me the scissors,\" said Mrs. Zane, \"and help me take off this dress. Why, it's wet, but, thank goodness! 'tis not with blood. I know that slippery touch too well. There, that's right. Betty, give me a spoonful of brandy. Now heat a blanket, and get one of your linsey gowns for this poor child.\"  Helen watched Mrs. Zane as if fascinated. The colonel's wife continued to talk while with deft fingers she forced a few drops of brandy between the girl's closed teeth. Then with the adroitness of a skilled surgeon, she made the examination. Helen had heard of this pioneer woman's skill in setting broken bones and treating injuries, and when she looked from the calm face to the steady fingers, she had no doubt as to the truth of what had been told.  \"Neither bullet wound, cut, bruise, nor broken bone,\" said Mrs. Zane. \"It's fear, starvation, and the terrible shock.\"  She rubbed Mabel's hands while gazing at her pale face. Then she forced more brandy between the tightly-closed lips. She was rewarded by ever so faint a color tinging the wan cheeks, to be followed by a fluttering of the eyelids. Then the eyes opened wide. They were large, soft, dark and humid with agony.  Helen could not bear their gaze. She saw the shadow of death, and of worse than death. She looked away, while in her heart rose a storm of passionate fury at the brutes who had made of this tender girl a wreck.  The room was full of women now, sober-faced matrons and grave-eyed girls, yet all wore the same expression, not alone of anger, nor fear, nor pity, but of all combined.  Helen instinctively felt that this was one of the trials of border endurance, and she knew from the sterner faces of the maturer women that such a trial was familiar. Despite all she had been told, the shock and pain were too great, and she went out of the room sobbing.  She almost fell over the broad back of Jonathan Zane who was sitting on the steps. Near him stood Colonel Zane talking with a tall man clad in faded buckskin.  \"Lass, you shouldn't have stayed,\" said Colonel Zane kindly.  \"It's--hurt--me--here,\" said Helen, placing her hand over her heart.  \"Yes, I know, I know; of course it has,\" he replied, taking her hand. \"But be brave, Helen, bear up, bear up. Oh! this border is a stern place! Do not think of that poor girl. Come, let me introduce Jonathan's friend, Wetzel!\"  Helen looked up and held out her hand. She saw a very tall man with extremely broad shoulders, a mass of raven-black hair, and a white face. He stepped forward, and took her hand in his huge, horny palm, pressing it, he stepped back without speaking. Colonel Zane talked to her in a soothing voice; but she failed to hear what he said. This Wetzel, this Indian-hunter whom she had heard called \"Deathwind of the Border,\" this companion, guide, teacher of Jonathan Zane, this borderman of wonderful deeds, stood before her.  Helen saw a cold face, deathly in its pallor, lighted by eyes sloe-black but like glinting steel. Striking as were these features, they failed to fascinate as did the strange tracings which apparently showed through the white, drawn skin. This first repelled, then drew her with wonderful force. Suffering, of fire, and frost, and iron was written there, and, stronger than all, so potent as to cause fear, could be read the terrible purpose of this man's tragic life.  \"You avenged her! Oh! I know you did!\" cried Helen, her whole heart leaping with a blaze to her eyes.  She was answered by a smile, but such a smile! Kindly it broke over the stern face, giving a glimpse of a heart still warm beneath that steely cold. Behind it, too, there was something fateful, something deadly.  Helen knew, though the borderman spoke not, that somewhere among the grasses of the broad plains, or on the moss of the wooded hills, lay dead the perpetrators of this outrage, their still faces bearing the ghastly stamp of Deathwind.     CHAPTER VI  Happier days than she had hoped for, dawned upon Helen after the first touch of border sorrow. Mabel Lane did not die. Helen and Betty nursed the stricken girl tenderly, weeping for very joy when signs of improvement appeared. She had remained silent for several days, always with that haunting fear in her eyes, and then gradually came a change. Tender care and nursing had due effect in banishing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],["title","Riders to the Sea (#0)"],["body","Riders to the Sea  A PLAY IN ONE ACT  by J. M. Synge  Contents   INTRODUCTION  RIDERS TO THE SEA     INTRODUCTION   It must have been on Synge’s second visit to the Aran Islands that he had the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his greatest play. The scene of “Riders to the Sea” is laid in a cottage on Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group. While Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body had been washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason of certain peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island. In due course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly the manner described in the play, and perhaps one of the most poignantly vivid passages in Synge’s book on “The Aran Islands” relates the incident of his burial.  The other element in the story which Synge introduces into the play is equally true. Many tales of “second sight” are to be heard among Celtic races. In fact, they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in the minds of the people. It is just such a tale, which there seems no valid reason for doubting, that Synge heard, and that gave the title, “Riders to the Sea”, to his play.  It is the dramatist’s high distinction that he has simply taken the materials which lay ready to his hand, and by the power of sympathy woven them, with little modification, into a tragedy which, for dramatic irony and noble pity, has no equal among its contemporaries. Great tragedy, it is frequently claimed with some show of justice, has perforce departed with the advance of modern life and its complicated tangle of interests and creature comforts. A highly developed civilisation, with its attendant specialisation of culture, tends ever to lose sight of those elemental forces, those primal emotions, naked to wind and sky, which are the stuff from which great drama is wrought by the artist, but which, as it would seem, are rapidly departing from us. It is only in the far places, where solitary communion may be had with the elements, that this dynamic life is still to be found continuously, and it is accordingly thither that the dramatist, who would deal with spiritual life disengaged from the environment of an intellectual maze, must go for that experience which will beget in him inspiration for his art. The Aran Islands from which Synge gained his inspiration are rapidly losing that sense of isolation and self-dependence, which has hitherto been their rare distinction, and which furnished the motivation for Synge’s masterpiece. Whether or not Synge finds a successor, it is none the less true that in English dramatic literature “Riders to the Sea” has an historic value which it would be difficult to over-estimate in its accomplishment and its possibilities. A writer in The Manchester Guardian shortly after Synge’s death phrased it rightly when he wrote that it is “the tragic masterpiece of our language in our time; wherever it has been played in Europe from Galway to Prague, it has made the word tragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to the spirit than it did.”  The secret of the play’s power is its capacity for standing afar off, and mingling, if we may say so, sympathy with relentlessness. There is a wonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character, wherein the latent power of suggestion is almost unlimited. “In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.” In the quavering rhythm of these words, there is poignantly present that quality of strangeness and remoteness in beauty which, as we are coming to realise, is the touchstone of Celtic literary art. However, the very asceticism of the play has begotten a corresponding power which lifts Synge’s work far out of the current of the Irish literary revival, and sets it high in a timeless atmosphere of universal action.  Its characters live and die. It is their virtue in life to be lonely, and none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great. He dies, and then it is the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to be great in their loneliness, great as Maurya, the stricken mother, is great in her final word.  “Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.” The pity and the terror of it all have brought a great peace, the peace that passeth understanding, and it is because the play holds this timeless peace after the storm which has bowed down every character, that “Riders to the Sea” may rightly take its place as the greatest modern tragedy in the English tongue.  EDWARD J. O’BRIEN.  February 23, 1911.     RIDERS TO THE SEA   A PLAY IN ONE ACT   First performed at the Molesworth Hall, Dublin, February 25th, 1904.  PERSONS  MAURYA (_an old woman_)......  Honor Lavelle BARTLEY (_her son_)..........  W. G. Fay CATHLEEN (_her daughter_)....  Sarah Allgood NORA (_a younger daughter_)..  Emma Vernon MEN AND WOMEN  SCENE.  An Island off the West of Ireland.     (Cottage kitchen, with nets, oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new     boards standing by the wall, etc. Cathleen, a girl of about twenty,     finishes kneading cake, and puts it down in the pot-oven by the     fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to spin at the wheel. Nora,     a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)   NORA. _In a low voice._—Where is she?  CATHLEEN. She’s lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she’s able.  [_Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl._]  CATHLEEN. _Spinning the wheel rapidly._—What is it you have?  NORA. The young priest is after bringing them. It’s a shirt and a plain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.  [_Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to listen._]  NORA. We’re to find out if it’s Michael’s they are, some time herself will be down looking by the sea.  CATHLEEN. How would they be Michael’s, Nora. How would he go the length of that way to the far north?  NORA. The young priest says he’s known the like of it. “If it’s Michael’s they are,” says he, “you can tell herself he’s got a clean burial by the grace of God, and if they’re not his, let no one say a word about them, for she’ll be getting her death,” says he, “with crying and lamenting.”  [_The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind._]  CATHLEEN. _Looking out anxiously._—Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to the Galway fair?  NORA. “I won’t stop him,” says he, “but let you not be afraid. Herself does be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God won’t leave her destitute,” says he, “with no son living.”  CATHLEEN. Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?  NORA. Middling bad, God help us. There’s a great roaring in the west, and it’s worse it’ll be getting when the tide’s turned to the wind.  [_She goes over to the table with the bundle._]  Shall I open it now?  CATHLEEN. Maybe she’d wake up on us, and come in before we’d done.  [_Coming to the table._]  It’s a long time we’ll be, and the two of us crying.  NORA. _Goes to the inner door and listens._—She’s moving about on the bed. She’ll be coming in a minute.  CATHLEEN. Give me the ladder, and I’ll put them up in the turf-loft, the way she won’t know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she’ll be going down to see would he be floating from the east.  [_They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the inner room._]  MAURYA. _Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously._—Isn’t it turf enough you have for this day and evening?  CATHLEEN. There’s a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [_Throwing down the turf_] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes to Connemara.  [_Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven._]  MAURYA. _Sitting down on a stool at the fire._—He won’t go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He won’t go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.  NORA. He’ll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.  MAURYA. Where is he itself?  NORA. He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week, and I’m thinking it won’t be long till he’s here now, for the tide’s turning at the green head, and the hooker’ tacking from the east.  CATHLEEN. I hear some one passing the big stones.  NORA. _Looking out._—He’s coming now, and he’s in a hurry.  BARTLEY. _Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly._—Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?  CATHLEEN. _Coming down._—Give it to him, Nora; it’s on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up this morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.  NORA. _Giving him a rope._—Is that it, Bartley?  MAURYA. You’d do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards [_Bartley takes the rope_]. It will be wanting in this place, I’m telling you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning, or any morning in the week, for it’s a deep grave we’ll make him by the grace of God.  BARTLEY. _Beginning to work with the rope._—I’ve no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.  MAURYA. It’s a hard thing they’ll be saying below if the body is washed up and there’s no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big price for the finest white boards you’d find in Connemara.  [_She looks round at the boards._]  BARTLEY. How"]]]
