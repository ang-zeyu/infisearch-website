In the Orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically washed by the floods, and in those parts alone where the stream is rapid; or, as the Indians say, \"the rocks are black where the waters are white.\" Here the coating is of a rich brown instead of a black colour, and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone.  Hand specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones which glitter in the sun's rays.  They occur only within the limits of the tidal waves; and as the rivulet slowly trickles down, the surf must supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers.  In like manner, the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the periodical inundations; and thus the same effects are produced under apparently different but really similar circumstances.  The origin, however, of these coatings of metallic oxides, which seem as if cemented to the rocks, is not understood; and no reason, I believe, can be assigned for their thickness remaining the same.  One day I was amused by watching the habits of the Diodon antennatus, which was caught swimming near the shore.  This fish, with its flabby skin, is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself into a nearly spherical form.  After having been taken out of water for a short time, and then again immersed in it, a considerable quantity both of water and air is absorbed by the mouth, and perhaps likewise by the branchial orifices.  This process is effected by two methods: the air is swallowed, and is then forced into the cavity of the body, its return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally visible: but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth, which is kept wide open and motionless; this latter action must, therefore, depend on suction.  The skin about the abdomen is much looser than that on the back; hence, during the inflation, the lower surface becomes far more distended than the upper; and the fish, in consequence, floats with its back downwards.  Cuvier doubts whether the Diodon in this position is able to swim; but not only can it thus move forward in a straight line, but it can turn round to either side.  This latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins; the tail being collapsed, and not used.  From the body being buoyed up with so much air, the branchial openings are out of water, but a stream drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them.  The fish, having remained in this distended state for a short time, generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the branchial apertures and mouth.  It could emit, at will, a certain portion of the water, and it appears, therefore, probable that this fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific gravity.  This Diodon possessed several means of defence.  It could give a severe bite, and could eject water from its mouth to some distance, at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of its jaws.  By the inflation of its body, the papillae, with which the skin is covered, become erect and pointed.  But the most curious circumstance is, that it secretes from the skin of its belly, when handled, a most beautiful carmine-red fibrous matter, which stains ivory and paper in so permanent a manner that the tint is retained with all its brightness to the present day: I am quite ignorant of the nature and use of this secretion.  I have heard from Dr. Allan of Forres, that he has frequently found a Diodon, floating alive and distended, in the stomach of the shark, and that on several occasions he has known it eat its way, not only through the coats of the stomach, but through the sides of the monster, which has thus been killed.  Who would ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed the great and savage shark?  March 18th.--We sailed from Bahia.  A few days afterwards, when not far distant from the Abrolhos Islets, my attention was called to a reddish-brown appearance in the sea.  The whole surface of the water, as it appeared under a weak lens, seemed as if covered by chopped bits of hay, with their ends jagged.  These are minute cylindrical confervae, in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each.  Mr. Berkeley informs me that they are the same species (Trichodesmium erythraeum) with that found over large spaces in the Red Sea, and whence its name of Red Sea is derived. [8] Their numbers must be infinite: the ship passed through several bands of them, one of which was about ten yards wide, and, judging from the mud-like colour of the water, at least two and a half miles long.  In almost every long voyage some account is given of these confervae.  They appear especially common in the sea near Australia; and off Cape Leeuwin I found an allied but smaller and apparently different species.  Captain Cook, in his third voyage, remarks, that the sailors gave to this appearance the name of sea-sawdust.  Near Keeling Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, I observed many little masses of confervae a few inches square, consisting of long cylindrical threads of excessive thinness, so as to be barely visible to the naked eye, mingled with other rather larger bodies, finely conical at both ends.  Two of these are shown in the woodcut united together.  They vary in length from .04 to .06, and even to .08 of an inch in length; and in diameter from .006 to .008 of an inch.  Near one extremity of the cylindrical part, a green septum, formed of granular matter, and thickest in the middle, may generally be seen.  This, I believe, is the bottom of a most delicate, colourless sac, composed of a pulpy substance, which lines the exterior case, but does not extend within the extreme conical points.  In some specimens, small but perfect spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the septa; and I observed the curious process by which they were produced.  The pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into lines, some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre; it then continued, with an irregular and rapid movement, to contract itself, so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a perfect little sphere, which occupied the position of the septum at one end of the now quite hollow case. The formation of the granular sphere was hastened by any accidental injury.  I may add, that frequently a pair of these bodies were attached to each other, as represented above, cone beside cone, at that end where the septum occurs.  I will add here a few other observations connected with the discoloration of the sea from organic causes.  On the coast of Chile, a few leagues north of Concepcion, the Beagle one day passed through great bands of muddy water, exactly like that of a swollen river; and again, a degree south of Valparaiso, when fifty miles from the land, the same appearance was still more extensive.  Some of the water placed in a glass was of a pale reddish tint; and, examined under a microscope, was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about, and often exploding.  Their shape is oval, and contracted in the middle by a ring of vibrating curved ciliae.  It was, however, very difficult to examine them with care, for almost the instant motion ceased, even while crossing the field of vision, their bodies burst.  Sometimes both ends burst at once, sometimes only one, and a quantity of coarse, brownish, granular matter was ejected.  The animal an instant before bursting expanded to half again its natural size; and the explosion took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had ceased: in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a rotatory movement on the longer axis.  About two minutes after any number were isolated in a drop of water, they thus perished. The animals move with the narrow apex forwards, by the aid of their vibratory ciliae, and generally by rapid starts. They are exceedingly minute, and quite invisible to the naked eye, only covering a space equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch.  Their numbers were infinite; for the smallest drop of water which I could remove contained very many.  In one day we passed through two spaces of water thus stained, one of which alone must have extended over several square miles.  What incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals!  The colour of the water, as seen at some distance, was like that of a river which has flowed through a red clay district, but under the shade of the vessel's side it was quite as dark as chocolate.  The line where the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined. The weather for some days previously had been calm, and the ocean abounded, to an unusual degree, with living creatures. [9]  In the sea around Tierra del Fuego, and at no great distance from the land, I have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour, from the number of crustacea, which somewhat resemble in form large prawns. The sealers call them whale-food.  Whether whales feed on them I do not know; but terns, cormorants, and immense herds of great unwieldy seals derive, on some parts of the coast, their chief sustenance from these swimming crabs.  Seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the water to spawn; but I found this to be the case only on one occasion. At the distance of several leagues from the Archipelago of the Galapagos, the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish, or mud-like water; these strips were some miles long, but only a few yards wide, and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous yet distinct margin. The colour was caused by little gelatinous balls, about the fifth of an inch in diameter, in which numerous minute spherical ovules were imbedded: they were of two distinct kinds, one being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other.  I cannot"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/944"],["title","The Voyage of the Beagle (#4)"],["body","a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these belonged.  Captain Colnett remarks, that this appearance is very common among the Galapagos Islands, and that the directions of the bands indicate that of the currents; in the described case, however, the line was caused by the wind.  The only other appearance which I have to notice, is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent colours.  I saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the coast of Brazil; the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcase of some whale, which probably was floating at no great distance.  I do not here mention the minute gelatinous particles, hereafter to be referred to, which are frequently dispersed throughout the water, for they are not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour.  There are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear remarkable: first, how do the various bodies which form the bands with defined edges keep together?  In the case of the prawn-like crabs, their movements were as co-instantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers; but this cannot happen from anything like voluntary action with the ovules, or the confervae, nor is it probable among the infusoria. Secondly, what causes the length and narrowness of the bands?  The appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent, where the stream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the eddies, that I must attribute the effect to a similar action either of the currents of the air or sea.  Under this supposition we must believe that the various organized bodies are produced in certain favourable places, and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water.  I confess, however, there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and confervae: for whence come the germs at such points?--the parent bodies having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean. But on no other hypothesis can I understand their linear grouping.  I may add that Scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic animals is invariably found in a certain part of the Arctic Sea.  [1] I state this on the authority of Dr. E. Dieffenbach, in his German translation of the first edition of this Journal.  [2] The Cape de Verd Islands were discovered in 1449. There was a tombstone of a bishop with the date of 1571; and a crest of a hand and dagger, dated 1497.  [3] I must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my specimens.  I have sent (June, 1845) a full account of the falling of this dust to the Geological Society.  [4] So named according to Patrick Symes's nomenclature.  [5] See Encyclop. of Anat. and Physiol., article Cephalopoda  [6] Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described (Philosophical Transactions, 1836, p. 65) a singular \"artificial substance resembling shell.\" It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown-coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water.  It is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter, than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell.

APRIL 4th to July 5th, 1832.--A few days after our arrival I became acquainted with an Englishman who was going to visit his estate, situated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital, to the northward of Cape Frio.  I gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing me to accompany him.  April 8th.--Our party amounted to seven.  The first stage was very interesting.  The day was powerfully hot, and as we passed through the woods, everything was motionless, excepting the large and brilliant butterflies, which lazily fluttered about.  The view seen when crossing the hills behind Praia Grande was most beautiful; the colours were intense, and the prevailing tint a dark blue; the sky and the calm waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour. After passing through some cultivated country, we entered a forest, which in the grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded.  We arrived by midday at Ithacaia; this small village is situated on a plain, and round the central house are the huts of the negroes.  These, from their regular form and position, reminded me of the drawings of the Hottentot habitations in Southern Africa.  As the moon rose early, we determined to start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the Lagoa Marica. As it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive, bare, and steep hills of granite which are so common in this country.  This spot is notorious from having been, for a long time, the residence of some runaway slaves, who, by cultivating a little ground near the top, contrived to eke out a subsistence.  At length they were discovered, and a party of soldiers being sent, the whole were seized with the exception of one old woman, who, sooner than again be led into slavery, dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain.  In a Roman matron this would have been called the noble love of freedom: in a poor negress it is mere brutal obstinacy.  We continued riding for some hours.  For the few last miles the road was intricate, and it passed through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons.  The scene by the dimmed light of the moon was most desolate.  A few fireflies flitted by us; and the solitary snipe, as it rose, uttered its plaintive cry.  The distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night.  April 9th.--We left our miserable sleeping-place before sunrise.  The road passed through a narrow sandy plain, lying between the sea and the interior salt lagoons.  The number of beautiful fishing birds, such as egrets and cranes, and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical forms, gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have possessed.  The few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants, among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideae were most to be admired. As the sun rose, the day became extremely hot, and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very distressing.  We dined at Mandetiba; the thermometer in the shade being 84 degs.  The beautiful view of the distant wooded hills, reflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon, quite refreshed us. As the venda [1] here was a very good one, and I have the pleasant, but rare remembrance, of an excellent dinner, I will be grateful and presently describe it, as the type of its class.  These houses are often large, and are built of thick upright posts, with boughs interwoven, and afterwards plastered.  They seldom have floors, and never glazed windows; but are generally pretty well roofed. Universally the front part is open, forming a kind of verandah, in which tables and benches are placed.  The bed-rooms join on each side, and here the passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can, on a wooden platform, covered by a thin straw mat.  The venda stands in a courtyard, where the horses are fed.  On first arriving it was our custom to unsaddle the horses and give them their Indian corn; then, with a low bow, to ask the senhor to do us the favour to give up something to eat. \"Anything you choose, sir,\" was his usual answer. For the few first times, vainly I thanked providence for having guided us to so good a man.  The conversation proceeding, the case universally became deplorable.  \"Any fish can you do us the favour of giving ?\"--\"Oh! no, sir.\"--\"Any soup?\"--\"No, sir.\"--\"Any bread?\"--\"Oh! no, sir.\"--\"Any dried meat?\"--\"Oh! no, sir.\" If we were lucky, by waiting a couple of hours, we obtained fowls, rice, and farinha.  It not unfrequently happened, that we were obliged to kill, with stones, the poultry for our own supper.  When, thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger, we timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal, the pompous, and (though true) most unsatisfactory answer was, \"It will be ready when it is ready.\" If we had dared to remonstrate any further, we should have been told to proceed on our journey, as being too impertinent.  The hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners; their houses and their persons are often filthily dirty; the want of the accommodation of forks, knives, and spoons is common; and I am sure no cottage or hovel in England could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every comfort.  At Campos Novos, however, we fared sumptuously; having rice and fowls, biscuit, wine, and spirits, for dinner; coffee in the evening, and fish with"]]]
