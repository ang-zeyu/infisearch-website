(#8)"],["body","it is the faith of the ONE GOD, who protects His chosen, and shall avenge their wrongs--the God who made earth and heaven; and who, in an idolatrous and benighted world, transmitted the knowledge of Himself and His holy laws, from age to age, through the channel of one solitary people, in the plains of Palestine, and by the waters of the Hebron.\"  \"And in that faith thou wert trained, maiden, by thy father?\" said the Dominican, calmly.  \"I am satisfied.  Rest here, in peace: we may meet again, soon.\"  The last words were spoken with a soft and tranquil smile--a smile in which glazing eyes and agonising hearts had often beheld the ghastly omen of the torture and the stake.  On quitting the unfortunate Leila, the monk took his way towards the neighbouring tent of Ferdinand.  But, ere he reached it, a new thought seemed to strike the holy man; he altered the direction of his steps, and gained one of those little shrines common in Catholic countries, and which had been hastily built of wood, in the centre of a small copse, and by the side of a brawling rivulet, towards the back of the king's pavilion.  But one solitary sentry, at the entrance of the copse, guarded the consecrated place; and its exceeding loneliness and quiet were a grateful contrast to the animated world of the surrounding camp.  The monk entered the shrine, and fell down on his knees before an image of the Virgin, rudely sculptured, indeed, but richly decorated.  \"Ah, Holy Mother!\" groaned this singular man, \"support me in the trial to which I am appointed.  Thou knowest that the glory of thy blessed Son is the sole object for which I live, and move, and have my being; but at times, alas! the spirit is infected with the weakness of the flesh.  Ora pro nobis, O Mother of mercy!  Verily, oftentimes my heart sinks within me when it is mine to vindicate the honour of thy holy cause against the young and the tender, the aged and the decrepit.  But what are beauty and youth, grey hairs and trembling knees, in the eye of the Creator? Miserable worms are we all; nor is there anything acceptable in the Divine sight but the hearts of the faithful.  Youth without faith, age without belief, purity without grace, virtue without holiness, are only more hideous by their seeming beauty--whited sepulchres, glittering rottenness.  I know this--I know it; but the human man is strong within me.  Strengthen me, that I pluck it out; so that, by diligent and constant struggle with the feeble Adam, thy servant may be reduced into a mere machine, to punish the godless and advance the Church.\"  Here sobs and tears choked the speech of the Dominican; he grovelled in the dust, he tore his hair, he howled aloud: the agony was fierce upon him.  At length, he drew from his robe a whip, composed of several thongs, studded with small and sharp nails; and, stripping his gown, and the shirt of hair worn underneath, over his shoulders, applied the scourge to the naked flesh with a fury that soon covered the green sward with the thick and clotted blood.  The exhaustion which followed this terrible penance seemed to restore the senses of the stern fanatic.  A smile broke over the features, that bodily pain only released from the anguished expression of mental and visionary struggles; and, when he rose, and drew the hair-cloth shirt over the lacerated and quivering flesh, he said--\"Now hast thou deigned to comfort and visit me, O pitying Mother; and, even as by these austerities against this miserable body, is the spirit relieved and soothed, so dost thou typify and betoken that men's bodies are not to be spared by those who seek to save souls and bring the nations of the earth into thy fold.\"  With that thought the countenance of Torquemada reassumed its wonted rigid and passionless composure; and, replacing the scourge, yet clotted with blood, in his bosom, he pursued his way to the royal tent.  He found Ferdinand poring over the accounts of the vast expenses of his military preparations, which he had just received from his treasurer; and the brow of the thrifty, though ostentatious monarch, was greatly overcast by the examination.  \"By the Bulls of Guisando!\" said the king, gravely, \"I purchase the salvation of my army in this holy war at a marvellous heavy price; and if the infidels hold out much longer, we shalt have to pawn our very patrimony of Arragon.\"  \"Son,\" answered the Dominican, \"to purposes like thine fear not that Providence itself will supply the worldly means.  But why doubtest thou? are not the means within thy reach?  It is just that thou alone shouldst not support the wars by which Christendom is glorified.  Are there not others?\"  \"I know what thou wouldst say, father,\" interrupted the king, quickly-- \"thou wouldst observe that my brother monarchs should assist me with arms and treasure.  Most just.  But they are avaricious and envious, Tomas; and Mammon hath corrupted them.\"  \"Nay, not to kings pointed my thought.\"  \"Well, then,\" resumed the king, impatiently, \"thou wouldst imply that mine own knights and nobles should yield up their coffers, and mortgage their possessions.  And so they ought; but they murmur already at what they have yielded to our necessities.\"  \"And in truth,\" rejoined the friar, \"these noble warriors should not be shorn of a splendour that well becomes the valiant champions of the Church.  Nay, listen to me, son, and I may suggest a means whereby, not the friends, but enemies, of the Catholic faith shall contribute to the down fall of the Paynim.  In thy dominions, especially those newly won, throughout Andalusia, in the kingdom of Cordova, are men of enormous wealth; the very caverns of the earth are sown with the impious treasure they have plundered from Christian hands, and consume in the furtherance of their iniquity.  Sire, I speak of the race that crucified the Lord.\"  \"The Jews--ay, but the excuse--\"  \"Is before thee.  This traitor, with whom thou boldest intercourse, who vowed to thee to render up Granada, and who was found the very next morning, fighting with the Moors, with the blood of a Spanish martyr red upon his hands, did he not confess that his fathers were of that hateful race? did he not bargain with thee to elevate his brethren to the rank of Christians? and has be not left with thee, upon false pretences, a harlot of his faith, who, by sorcery and the help of the Evil One, hath seduced into frantic passion the heart of the heir of the most Christian king?\"  \"Ha! thus does that libertine boy ever scandalise us!\" said the king, bitterly.  \"Well,\" pursued the Dominican, not heeding the interruption, \"have you not here excuse enough to wring from the whole race the purchase of their existence?  Note the glaring proof of this conspiracy of hell.  The outcasts of the earth employed this crafty agent to contract with thee for power; and, to consummate their guilty designs, the arts that seduced Solomon are employed against thy son.  The beauty of the strange woman captivates his senses; so that, through the future sovereign of Spain the counsels of Jewish craft may establish the domination of Jewish ambition. How knowest thou,\" he added as he observed that Ferdinand listened to him with earnest attention--\"how knowest thou but what the next step might have been thy secret assassination, so that the victim of witchcraft, the minion of the Jewess, might reign in the stead of the mighty and unconquerable Ferdinand?\"  \"Go on, father,\" said the king, thoughtfully; \"I see, at least, enough to justify an impost upon these servitors of Mammon.\"  \"But, though common sense suggests to us,\" continued Torquemada, \"that this disguised Israelite could not have acted on so vast a design without the instigation of his brethren, not only in Granada, but throughout all Andalusia,--would it not be right to obtain from him his confession, and that of the maiden, within the camp, so that we may have broad and undeniable evidence, whereon to act, and to still all cavil, that may come not only from the godless, but even from the too tender scruples of the righteous?  Even the queen--whom the saints ever guard!--hath ever too soft a heart for these infidels; and--\"  \"Right!\" cried the king, again breaking upon Torquemada; \"Isabel, the queen of Castile, must be satisfied of the justice of all our actions.\"  \"And, should it be proved that thy throne or life were endangered, and that magic was exercised to entrap her royal son into a passion for a Jewish maiden, which the Church holds a crime worthy of excommunication itself, surely, instead of counteracting, she would assist our schemes.\"  \"Holy friend,\" said Ferdinand, with energy, \"ever a comforter, both for this world and the next, to thee, and to the new powers intrusted to thee, we commit this charge; see to it at once; time presses--Granada is obstinate--the treasury waxes low.\"  \"Son, thou hast said enough,\" replied the Dominican, closing his eyes, and muttering a short thanksgiving.  \"Now then to my task.\"  \"Yet stay,\" said the king, with an altered visage; \"follow me to my oratory within: my heart is heavy, and I would fain seek the solace of the confessional.\"  The monk obeyed: and while Ferdinand, whose wonderful abilities were mingled with the weakest superstition, who persecuted from policy, yet believed, in his own heart, that he punished but from piety,--confessed with penitent tears the grave offences of aves forgotten, and beads untold; and while the Dominican admonished, rebuked, or soothed,--neither prince nor monk ever dreamt that there was an error to confess in, or a penance to be adjudged to, the cruelty that tortured a fellow-being, or the avarice that sought pretences for the extortion of a whole people.

CHAPTER I.  ISABEL AND THE JEWISH MAIDEN.  While this scene took place before the tribunal of Torquemada, Leila had been summoned from the indulgence of fears, which her gentle nature and her luxurious nurturing had ill-fitted her to contend against, to the presence of the queen.  That gifted and high-spirited princess, whose virtues were her own, whose faults were of her age, was not, it is true, without the superstition and something of the intolerant spirit of her royal spouse: but, even where her faith assented to persecution, her heart ever inclined to mercy; and it was her voice alone that ever counteracted the fiery zeal of Torquemada, and mitigated the sufferings of the unhappy ones who fell under the suspicion of heresy.  She had, happily, too, within her a strong sense of justice, as well as the sentiment of compassion; and often, when she could not save the accused, she prevented the consequences of his imputed crime falling upon the innocent members of his house or tribe.  In the interval between his conversation with Ferdinand and the examination of Almamen, the Dominican had sought the queen; and had placed before her, in glowing colours, not only the treason of Almamen, but the consequences of the impious passion her son had conceived for Leila.  In that day, any connection between a Christian knight and a Jewess was deemed a sin, scarce expiable; and Isabel conceived all that horror of her son's offence which was natural in a pious mother and a haughty queen.  But, despite all the arguments of the friar, she could not be prevailed upon to render up Leila to the tribunal of the Inquisition; and that dread court, but newly established, did not dare, without her consent, to seize upon one under the immediate protection of the queen.  \"Fear not, father,\" said Isabel, with quiet firmness, \"I will take upon myself to examine the maiden; and, at least, I will see her removed from all chance of tempting or being tempted by this graceless boy.  But she was placed under the charge of the king and myself as a hostage and a trust; we accepted the charge, and our royal honor is pledged to the safety of the maiden.  Heaven forbid that I should deny the existence of sorcery, assured as we are of its emanation from the Evil One; but I fear, in this fancy of Juan's, that the maiden is more sinned against than sinning: and yet my son is, doubtless, not aware of the unhappy faith of the Jewess; the knowledge of which alone will suffice to cure him of his error.  You shake your head, father; but, I repeat, I will act in this affair so as to merit the confidence I demand.  Go, good Tomas. We have not reigned so long without belief in our power to control and deal with a simple maiden.\"  The queen extended her hand to the monk, with a smile so sweet in its dignity, that it softened even that rugged heart; and, with a reluctant sigh, and a murmured prayer that her counsels might be guided for the best, Torquemada left the royal presence.  \"The poor child!\" thought Isabel, \"those tender limbs, and that fragile form, are ill fitted for yon monk's stern tutelage.  She seems gentle: and her face has in it all the yielding softness of our sex; doubtless by mild means, she may be persuaded to abjure her wretched creed; and the shade of some holy convent may hide her alike from the licentious gaze of my son and the iron zeal of the Inquisitor.  I will see her.\"  When Leila entered the queen's pavilion, Isabel, who was alone, marked her trembling step with a compassionate eye; and, as Leila, in obedience to the queen's request, threw up her veil, the paleness of her cheek and the traces of recent tears appealed to Isabel's heart with more success than had attended all the pious invectives of Torquemada.  \"Maiden,\" said Isabel, encouragingly, \"I fear thou hast been strangely harassed by the thoughtless caprice of the young prince.  Think of it no more.  But, if thou art what I have ventured to believe, and to assert thee to be, cheerfully subscribe to the means I will suggest for preventing the continuance of addresses which cannot but injure thy fair name.\"  \"Ah, madam!\" said Leila, as she fell on one knee beside the queen, \"most joyfully, most gratefully, will I accept any asylum which proffers solitude and peace.\"  \"The asylum to which I would fain lead thy steps,\" answered Isabel, gently, \"is indeed one whose solitude is holy--whose peace is that of heaven.  But of this hereafter.  Thou wilt not hesitate, then, to quit the camp, unknown to the prince, and ere he can again seek thee?\"  \"Hesitate, madam?  Ah rather, how shall I express my thanks?\"  \"I did not read that face misjudgingly,\" thought the queen, as she resumed.  \"Be it so; we will not lose another night.  Withdraw yonder, through the inner tent; the litter shall be straight prepared for thee; and ere midnight thou shalt sleep in safety under the roof of one of the bravest knights and noblest ladies that our realm can boast.  Thou shalt bear with thee a letter that shall commend thee specially to the care of thy hostess--thou wilt find her of a kindly and fostering nature.  And, oh, maiden!\" added the queen, with benevolent warmth, \"steel not thy heart against her--listen with ductile senses to her gentle ministry; and may God and His Son prosper that pious lady's counsel, so that it may win a new strayling to the Immortal Fold!\"  Leila listened and wondered, but made no answer; until, as she gained the entrance to the interior division of the tent, she stopped abruptly, and said, \"Pardon me, gracious queen, but dare I ask thee one question?--it is not of myself.\"  \"Speak, and fear not.\"  \"My father--hath aught been heard of him?  He promised, that ere the fifth day were past, he would once more see his child; and, alas! that date is past, and I am still alone in the dwelling of the stranger.\"  \"Unhappy child!\" muttered Isabel to herself; \"thou knowest not his treason nor his fate--yet why shouldst thou?  Ignorant of what would render thee blest hereafter, continue ignorant of what would afflict thee here.  Be cheered, maiden,\" answered the queen, aloud.  \"No doubt, there are reasons sufficient to forbid your meeting.  But thou shalt not lack friends in the dwelling-house of the stranger.\"  \"Ah, noble queen, pardon me, and one word more!  There hath been with me, more than once, a stern old man, whose voice freezes the blood within my veins; he questions me of my father, and in the tone of a foe who would entrap from the child something to the peril of the sire.  That man--thou knowest him, gracious queen--he cannot have the power to harm my father?\"  \"Peace, maiden! the man thou speakest of is the priest of God, and the innocent have nothing to dread from his reverend zeal.  For thyself, I say again, be cheered; in the home to which I consign thee thou wilt see him no more.  Take comfort, poor child--weep not: all have their cares; our duty is to bear in this life, reserving hope only for the next.\"  The queen, destined herself to those domestic afflictions which pomp cannot soothe, nor power allay, spoke with a prophetic sadness which yet more touched a heart that her kindness of look and tone had already softened; and, in the impulse of a nature never tutored in the rigid ceremonials of that stately court, Leila suddenly came forward, and falling on one knee, seized the hand of her protectress, and kissed it warmly through her tears.  \"Are you, too, unhappy?\" she said.  \"I will pray for you to _my_ God!\"  The queen, surprised and moved at an action which, had witnesses been present, would only perhaps (for such is human nature) have offended her Castilian prejudices, left her hand in Leila's grateful clasp; and laying the other upon the parted and luxuriant ringlets of the kneeling maiden, said, gently,--\"And thy prayers shall avail thee and me when thy God and mine are the same.  Bless thee, maiden!  I am a mother; thou art motherless--bless thee!\"     CHAPTER II.  THE TEMPTATION OF THE JEWESS,--IN WHICH THE HISTORY PASSES FROM THE OUTWARD TO THE INTERNAL.  It was about the very hour, almost the very moment, in which Almamen effected his mysterious escape from the tent of the Inquisition, that the train accompanying the litter which bore Leila, and which was composed of some chosen soldiers of Isabel's own body-guard, after traversing the camp, winding along that part of the mountainous defile which was in the possession of the Spaniards, and ascending a high and steep acclivity, halted before the gates of a strongly fortified castle renowned in the chronicles of that memorable war.  The hoarse challenge of the sentry, the grating of jealous bars, the clanks of hoofs upon the rough pavement of the courts, and the streaming glare of torches--falling upon stern and bearded visages, and imparting a ruddier glow to the moonlit buttresses and battlements of the fortress--aroused Leila from a kind of torpor rather than sleep, in which the fatigue and excitement of the day had steeped her senses.  An old seneschal conducted her, through vast and gloomy halls (how unlike the brilliant chambers and fantastic arcades of her Moorish home) to a huge Gothic apartment, hung with the arras of Flemish looms.  In a few moments, maidens, hastily aroused from slumber, grouped around her with a respect which would certainly not have been accorded had her birth and creed been known.  They gazed with surprise at her extraordinary beauty and foreign garb, and evidently considered the new guest a welcome"]]]
