Again they pass the night at the house of one of Enan's friends, Rabbi Judah, a ripe old sage and hospitable, who welcomes them cordially, feeds them bountifully, gives them spiced dishes, wine of the grape and the pomegranate, and then tells stories and proverbs \"from the books of the Arabs.\"    A man said to a sage, \"Thou braggest of thy wisdom, but it came from me.\"   \"Yes,\" replied the sage, \"and it forgot its way back.\"--Who is the worst   of men?

Be brief and do not repeat   yourself.--The king once visited a nobleman's house, and asked the   latter's son, \"Whose house is better, your father's or mine?\" \"My   father's,\" said the boy, \"while the king is in it.\"--A king put on a new   robe, which did not become him. \"It is not good to wear,\" said a   courtier, \"but it is good to put on.\" The king put the robe on him.--A   bore visited a sick man. \"What ails thee?\" he asked. \"Thy presence,\" said   the sufferer.--A man of high lineage abused a wise man of lowly birth.   \"My lineage is a blot on me,\" retorted a sage, \"thou art a blot on thy   lineage.\"--To another who reviled him for his lack of noble ancestry, he   retorted, \"Thy noble line ends with thee, with me mine begins.\"--Diogenes   and Dives were attacked by robbers. \"Woe is me,\" said Dives, \"if they   recognize me.\" \"Woe is me,\" said Diogenes, \"if they do not recognize   me.\"--A philosopher sat by the target at which the archers were shooting.   \"'Tis the safest spot,\" said he.--An Arab's brother died. \"Why did he   die?\" one asked. \"Because he lived,\" was the answer.--\"What hast thou   laid up for the cold weather?\" they asked a poor fellow. \"Shivering,\" he   answered.--Death is the dread of the rich and the hope of the   poor.--Which is the best of the beasts?

But fear not. Thou art no   doctor.\"--Three things weary: a lamp that will not burn, a messenger that   dawdles, a table spread and waiting.  Then follows a string of sayings about _threes_:    Reason rules the body, wisdom is the pilot, law is its light. Might is   the lion's, burdens are the ox's, wisdom is man's; spinning the spider's,   building the bee's, making stores the ant's. In three cases lying is   permissible: in war, in reconciling man to man, in appeasing one's wife.  Their host concludes his lengthy list of sententious remarks thus:    A king had a signet ring, on which were engraved the words, \"Thou hast   bored me: rise!\" and when a guest stayed too long, he showed the visitor   the ring.-The heir of a wealthy man squandered his money, and a sage saw   him eating bread and salted olives. \"Hadst thou thought that this would   be thy food, this would not be thy food.\"-Marry no widow. She will lament   her first husband's death.   THE CITY OF ENAN  This was the signal for the party to retire to rest.  Next day the wayfarers reach Enan's own city, the place he had all along desired Joseph to see. He shows Joseph his house; but the latter replies, \"I crave food, not sight-seeing.\" \"Surely,\" says Enan, \"the more hurry the less speed.\" At last the table is spread; the cloth is ragged, the dishes contain unleavened bread, such as there is no pleasure in eating, and there is a dish of herbs and vinegar. Then ensues a long wrangle, displaying much medical knowledge, on the physiology of herbs and vegetables, on the eating of flesh, much and fast. Enan makes sarcastic remarks on Joseph's rapacious appetite. He tells Joseph, he must not eat this or that. A joint of lamb is brought on the table, Enan says the head is bad, and the feet, and the flesh, and the fat; so that Joseph has no alternative but to eat it all. \"I fear that what happened to the king, will befall thee,\" said Enan. \"Let me feed first,\" said Joseph; \"then you can tell me what happened to the king.\"   THE PRINCESS AND THE ROSE    A gardener came to his garden in the winter. It was the month of Tebet,   and he found some roses in flower. He rejoiced at seeing them; and he   plucked them, and put them on a precious dish, carried them to the king,   and placed them before him. The king was surprised, and the flowers were   goodly in his sight; and he gave the gardener one hundred pieces of gold.   Then said the king in his heart, \"To-day we will make merry, and have a   feast.\" All his servants and faithful ministers were invited to rejoice   over the joy of the roses. And he sent for his only daughter, then with   child; and she stretched forth her hand to take a rose, and a serpent   that lay in the dish leapt at her and startled her, and she died before   night.   QUESTION AND ANSWER  But Joseph's appetite was not to be stayed by such tales as this. So Enan tells him of the \"Lean Fox and the Hole\"; but in vain. \"Open not thy mouth to Satan,\" says Joseph. \"I fear for my appetite, that it become smaller\"; and goes on eating.  Now Enan tries another tack: he will question him, and put him through his paces. But Joseph yawns and protests that he has eaten too much to keep his eyes open.    \"How canst thou sleep,\" said Enan, \"when thou hast eaten everything,   fresh and stale? As I live, thou shalt not seek thy bed until I test thy   wisdom-until I prove whether all this provender has entered the stomach   of a wise man or a fool.\"  Then follows an extraordinary string of anatomical, medical, scientific, and Talmudic questions about the optic nerves; the teeth; why a man lowers his head when thinking over things he has never known, but raises his head when thinking over what he once knew but has forgotten; the physiology of the digestive organs, the physiology of laughter; why a boy eats more than a man; why it is harder to ascend a hill than to go down; why snow is white; why babies have no teeth; why children's first set of teeth fall out; why saddest tears are saltest; why sea water is heavier than fresh; why hail descends in summer; why the sages said that bastards are mostly clever. To these questions, which Enan pours out in a stream, Joseph readily gives answers. But now Enan is hoist with his own petard.    \"I looked at him,\" continues the poet, \"and sleep entrapped his eyes, and   his eyelids kissed the irides. Ah! I laughed in my heart. Now I will talk   to him, and puzzle him as he has been puzzling me. He shall not sleep, as   he would not let me sleep. 'My lord,' said I, 'let me now question thee.'   'I am sleepy,' said he, 'but ask on.' 'What subject shall I choose?' I   said. 'Any subject,' he replied; 'of all knowledge I know the half.'\"   Joseph asks him astronomical, musical, logical, arithmetical questions;   to all of which Enan replies, \"I do not know.\" \"But,\" protests Joseph,   \"how couldst thou assert that thou knewest half of every subject, when it   is clear thou knowest nothing?\" \"Exactly,\" says Enan, \"for Aristotle   says, 'He who says, I do not know, has already attained the half of   knowledge.'\"  But he says he knows medicine; so Joseph proceeds to question him. Soon he discovers that Enan is again deceiving him; and he abuses Enan roundly for his duplicity.  Enan at length is moved to retort.    \"I wonder at thy learning,\" says Enan, \"but more at thy appetite.\" Then   the lamp goes out, the servant falls asleep, and they are left in   darkness till the morning. Then Joseph demands his breakfast, and goes   out to see his ass. The ass attempts to bite Joseph, who strikes it, and   the ass speaks. \"I am one of the family of Balaam's ass,\" says the   animal. \"But I am not Balaam,\" says Joseph, \"to divine that thou hast   eaten nothing all night.\" The servant asserts that he fed the ass, but   the animal had gobbled up everything, his appetite being equal to his   owner's. But Joseph will not believe this, and Enan is deeply hurt.   \"Peace!\" he shouts, and his eyes shoot flames, and his nostrils distil   smoke. \"Peace, cease thy folly, or, as I live, and my ancestor Asmodeus,   I will seize thee with my little finger, and will show thee the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],["title","The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#7)"],["body","of   David.\"    In timid tones Joseph asks him, \"Who is this Asmodeus, thy kinsman?\"   ENAN REVEALS HIMSELF    \"Asmodeus,\" said Enan, \"the great prince who, on his wing, bore Solomon   from his kingdom to a distant strand.\" \"Woe is me,\" I moaned, \"I thought   thee a friend; now thou art a fiend. Why didst thou hide thy nature? Why   didst thou conceal thy descent? Why hast thou taken me from my home in   guile?\" \"Nay,\" said Enan, \"where was thy understanding? I gave thee my   name, thou shouldst have inverted it\" [i.e., transpose _Desh_ to _Shed_.   Enan at the beginning of the tale had announced himself as _ha-Desh_, he   now explains that meant _ha-Shed_ = the demon]. Then Enan gives his   pedigree: \"I am Enan, the Satan, son of Arnan the Demon, son of the Place   of Death, son of Rage, son of Death's Shadow, son of Terror, son of   Trembling, son of Destruction, son of Extinction, son of Evil-name, son   of Mocking, son of Plague, son of Deceit, son of Injury, son of   Asmodeus.\"  Nevertheless Enan quiets Joseph's fears, and promises that no harm shall befall him. He goes through Enan's city, sees wizards and sorcerers, and sinners and fools, all giants.   ENAN'S FRIEND AND HIS DAUGHTER    Then Enan introduces his own especial friend. \"He is good and wise,\" said   Enan, \"despite his tall stature. He shows his goodness in hating the wise   and loving fools; he is generous, for he will give a beggar a crust of   dry bread, and make him pay for it; he knows medicine, for he can tell   that if a man is buried, he either has been sick, or has had an accident;   he knows astronomy, for he can tell that it is day when the sun shines,   and night when the stars appear; he knows arithmetic, for he can tell   that one and one make two; he knows mensuration, for he can tell how many   handbreadths his belly measures; he knows music, for he can tell the   difference between the barking of a dog and the braying of an ass.\" \"But,   said I,\" continues Joseph, \"how canst thou be the friend of such a one?   Accursed is he, accursed his master.\" \"Nay,\" answered Enan, \"I love him   not; I know his vile nature: 'tis his daughter that binds me to him, for   she, with her raven locks and dove's eyes and lily cheeks, is fair beyond   my power to praise.\" Yet I warned him against marrying the daughter of an   uneducated man, an Am ha-Arez. Then follows a compilation of passages   directed against ignorance. \"Ah!\" cries Enan, \"your warning moves me. My   love for her is fled. Thou fearest God and lovest me, my friend. What is   a friend? One heart in two bodies. Then find me another wife, one who is   beautiful and good. Worse than a plague is a bad woman. Listen to what   once befell me with such a one.\"  Thereupon Enan introduces the last of the stories incorporated into the book:   THE WASHERWOMAN WHO DID THE DEVIL'S WORK    Once upon a time, in my wanderings to and fro upon the earth, I came to a   city whose inhabitants dwelt together, happy, prosperous, and secure. I   made myself well acquainted with the place and the people, but, despite   all my efforts, I was unable to entrap a single one. \"This is no place   for me,\" I said, \"I had better return to my own country.\" I left the   city, and, journeying on, came across a river, at the brink of which I   seated myself. Scarcely had I done so, when a woman appeared bearing her   garments to be washed in the river. She looked at me, and asked, \"Art   thou of the children of men or of demons?\" \"Well,\" said I, \"I have grown   up among men, but I was born among demons.\" \"But what art thou after   here?\" \"Ah,\" I replied, \"I have spent a whole month in yonder city. And   what have I found? A city full of friends, enjoying every happiness in   common. In vain have I tried to put a little of wickedness among them.\"   Then the woman, with a supercilious air: \"If I am to take thee for a   specimen, I must have a very poor opinion of the whole tribe of demons.   You seem mighty enough, but you haven't the strength of women. Stop here   and keep an eye on the wash; but mind, play me no tricks. I will go back   to the city and kindle therein fire and fury, and pour over it a spirit   of mischief, and thou shalt see how I can manage things.\" \"Agreed!\" said   I, \"I will stay here and await thy coming, and watch how affairs turn out   in thy hands.\"    The washerwoman departed, went into the city, called upon one of the   great families there residing, and requested to see the lady of the   house. She asked for a washing order, which she promised to execute to   the most perfect satisfaction. While the housemaid was collecting the   linen, the washerwoman lifted her eyes to the beautiful face of the   mistress, and exclaimed: \"Yes, they are a dreadful lot, the men; they are   all alike, a malediction on them! The best of them is not to be trusted.   They love all women but their own wives.\" \"What dost thou mean?\" asked   the lady. \"Merely this,\" she answered. \"Coming hither from my house, whom   should I meet but thy husband making love to another woman, and such a   hideous creature, too! How he could forsake beauty so rare and exquisite   as thine for such disgusting ugliness, passes my understanding. But do   not weep, dear lady, don't distress thyself and give way. I know a means   by which I shall bring that husband of thine to his senses, so that thou   shalt suffer no reproach, and he shall never love any other woman than   thee. This is what thou must do. When thy husband comes home, speak   softly and sweetly to him; let him suspect nothing; and when he has   fallen asleep, take a sharp razor and cut off three hairs from his beard;   black or white hairs, it matters not. These thou must afterwards give to   me, and with them I will compound such a remedy that his eyes shall be   darkened in their sockets, so that he will look no more upon other lovely   women, but cling to thee alone in mighty and manifest and enduring love.\"   All this the lady promised, and gifts besides for the washerwoman, should   her plan prosper.    Carrying the garments with her, the woman now sought out the lady's   husband. With every sign of distress in her voice and manner, she told   him that she had a frightful secret to divulge to him. She knew not if   she would have the strength to do so. She would rather die first The   husband was all the more eager to know, and would not be refused. \"Well,   then,\" she said, \"I have just been to thy house, where my lady, thy wife,   gave me these garments to wash; and, while I was yet standing there, a   youth, of handsome mien and nobly attired, arrived, and the two withdrew   into an adjoining room: so I inclined mine ear to listen to their speech,   and this is what I overheard: The young man said to thy wife, 'Kill thy   husband, and I will marry thee,' She, however, declared that she was   afraid to do such a dreadful deed. 'O,' answered he, 'with a little   courage it is quite easy. When thy husband is asleep, take a sharp razor   and cut his throat.'\" In fierce rage, but suppressing all outward   indication of it, the husband returned home. Pretending to fall asleep,   he watched his wife closely, saw her take a razor to sever the three   hairs for the washerwoman's spell, darted up suddenly, wrested the razor   from her hands, and with it slew his wife on the spot.    The news spread; the relations of the wife united to avenge her death,   and kill the husband. In their turn his relatives resolved to avenge him;   both houses were embroiled, and before the feud was at an end, two   hundred and thirty lives were sacrificed. The city resounded with a great   cry, the like of which had never been heard. \"From that day,\" concluded   Enan, \"I decided to injure no man more. Yet for this very reason I fear   to wed an evil woman.\" \"Fear not,\" returned Joseph, \"the girl I recommend   is beautiful and good.\" And Enan married her, and loved her.  Thus Enan is metamorphosed from a public demon into something of a domestic saint. Zabara gives us an inverted Faust.   JOSEPH RETURNS HOME TO BARCELONA  \"After a while,\" concludes Joseph, \"I said to him, 'I have sojourned long enough in this city, the ways of which please me not. Ignorance prevails, and poetry is unknown; the law is despised; the young are set over the old; they slander and are impudent. Let me go home after my many years of wandering in a strange land. Fain would I seek the place where dwells the great prince, Rabbi Sheshet Benveniste, of whom Wisdom says, Thou art my teacher, and Faith, Thou art my friend.' 'What qualitie,' asked Enan, 'brought him to this lofty place of righteousness and power?' 'His simplicity and humility, his uprightness and saintliness.'\"  And with this eulogy of the aged Rabbi of Barcelona, the poem somewhat inconsequently ends. It may be that the author left the work without putting in the finishing touches. This would account for the extra stories, which, as was seen above, may belong to the book, though not incorporated into it.  It will be thought, from the summary mode in which I have rendered these stories, that I take Zabara to be rather a literary curiosity than a poet. But Zabara's poetical merits are considerable. If I have refrained from attempting a literal rendering, it is mainly because the rhymed-prose _genre_ is so characteristically Oriental that its charm is incommunicable in a Western language. Hence, to those who do not read Zabara in the original, he is more easily appreciated as a _conteur_ than as an imaginative writer. To the Hebraist, too, something of the same remark applies. Rhymed prose is not much more consistent with the genius of Hebrew than it is with the genius of English. Arabic and Persian seem the only languages in which rhymed prose assumes a natural and melodious shape. In the new-Hebrew, rhymed prose has always been an exotic, never quite a native flower. The most skilful gardeners failed to acclimatize it thoroughly in European soil. Yet"]]]
