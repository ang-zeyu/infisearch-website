The Radicals (four Moravian People's Party, two State Right Party, one Realist) formed a party of independent deputies with Professor Masaryk at their head. They demanded full independence for Bohemia, some of them laying greater stress on her historical rights, some on the natural right of Czecho-Slovaks to liberty.  The whole group of Czech deputies stood in opposition against Vienna with the exception of Kramár, who tried to imitate the Polish positivist policy in the hope of obtaining concessions in return. But, as we have already shown in a previous chapter, Dr. Kramár abandoned this policy even before the war, when he saw how completely Austria was tied to Germany. The bulk of the Czech people were, of course, always solidly anti-Austrian. During the Balkan War the Czechs openly showed their sympathies with their brother Slavs who were struggling for liberty.  The _Clerical Party_ had comparatively little influence and prestige. All their deputies (seven) were elected in country districts of Moravia, where civilisation is comparatively less developed than in Bohemia. In Bohemia and in the more developed districts of Moravia, people resist the efforts of the clergy to mix religion with politics. The three million Slovaks in Hungary, who speak a dialect of Czech and who form with the Czechs a single Czecho-Slovak nation, had only two deputies (Dr. Blaho and Father Juriga), and were without any influence in the Budapest Parliament.  11. Although many Czech politicians foresaw that Austria's anti-Serbian policy in the Balkans and her increasing dependence on Germany must lead to war, yet on the whole the Czechs were not prepared for this contingency. The Reichsrat was closed when war broke out, and the Diet of Bohemia had been replaced by an Imperial Commission in 1913. War was declared by Austria against the will of the Slavs, and yet they did not dare to protest, as an organised revolution was impossible in view of the presence of German troops and of the perfect police spy system in Austria. Two German divisions would have been sufficient to suppress the best organised revolutionary movement in Bohemia.  The immediate effect of the declaration of war was the unity of the whole Czech nation. One of the leaders, Professor Masaryk, escaped abroad, and is at the head of the Czecho-Slovak Government, recognised by the Allies as the trustee and representative of the Czecho-Slovak nation.  Political activity was of course out of the question until the Reichsrat reopened on May 30, 1917. Before that date there was an absolute reign of terror in Bohemia. Some of the leading Czech newspapers were suspended soon after the outbreak of the war. The few Slovak papers published in Hungary were suppressed at the same time.  Those newspapers which survived were subject to strict censorship and were compelled to publish leading articles written by government officials and supplied to them by the police. Dr. Kramár, one of the most prominent Czech leaders, his colleague Dr. Rasín, and five National Socialist deputies were thrown into prison, and some of them even sentenced to death.  The effect of these persecutions was that all the Czecho-Slovaks became unanimous in their desire to obtain full independence of Austria-Hungary. Old party differences were forgotten and some of the Czech deputies who had formerly been opportunist in tendency, such as Dr. Kramár and the Agrarian ex-minister Prásek, now at last became convinced that all hopes of an anti-German Austria were futile, that Austria was doomed, as she was a blind tool in the hands of Germany, and that the only way to prevent the ten million Czecho-Slovaks from being again exploited in the interests of German imperialism was to secure their complete independence. On entering the Reichsrat on May 30, 1917, all the Czech deputies, united in a single \"Bohemian Union,\" made a unanimous declaration that it was their aim to work for the union of all Czechs and Slovaks in an independent, democratic state. To-day Dr. Kramár is in complete agreement with the Radicals who formerly were his most bitter opponents. In fact four Czech nationalist parties (the Young Czech, Realist, State Right and Moravian People's Parties) united in February, 1918, as a single body under the name of \"The Czech State-Right Democracy.\" The president of its executive is the former Young Czech leader Dr. Kramár, who was sentenced to death in 1916, but released in July, 1917. The executive committee of the new party included all the leaders of the four former parties, namely, Dr. Stránský, Dr. Herben, M. Dyk, Professor Drtina, and others.  In their proclamation published in the _Národní Listy_ of February 10, 1918, the executive declared that:      \"The chief aim of the new party will be to engage in a common national     effort for the creation of an independent Bohemian State, the     fundamental territory of which will be composed of the historical and     indivisible crown-lands of Bohemia and of Slovakia. The Bohemian State     will be a democratic state. All its power will come from the people.     And as it will come from the Czech people, it will be just towards all     nationalities, towards all citizens and classes.\"  In a speech to the Young Czech Party before its dissolution, Dr. Kramár openly declared that \"at the moment of the outbreak of the war it became quite clear that, despite all tactics of opportunism, our party remained true to the programme of Czech independence. It became at once evident to all of us that _the chapter of our former policy was forever closed for us_. We felt with our whole soul that the Czech nation would not go through the sufferings of the world war only to renew the pre-war tactics of a slow progress towards that position to which we have full historical rights as well as the natural rights of a living and strong nation....\" And again, in an article in the _Národní Listy_ of December 25, 1917, Kramár wrote under the heading \"By Order of the Nation\":      \"We have sought with utmost sacrifice to find a compromise between our     just claims and the international situation which was unfavourable to     us. The war has completely changed all our policy, removing the     possibility of a compromise to which we might have been disposed, and     we cannot once more roll up our flag now so proudly unfurled, and put     it aside for the next occasion.\"  As we shall show also later on, there is not the least doubt that the necessity for the independence of Bohemia was proclaimed not by a few extremists, but by all the Czech parties with the approval of the entire nation.  When Kramár in 1917 again took over the leadership of the Young Czech Party, which led to the amalgamation of four nationalist parties, a change took place also in the leadership of the Czech Social Democratic Party which hitherto was in the hands of a few demagogues and defeatists, such as Smeral, who dominated the majority of the members. The return of the Socialist Party to its revolutionary traditions and its entire approval of the Bohemian state right and the national policy of Czecho-Slovak independence means a complete and absolute consolidation of the whole Czech nation.  As the Social Democrats became quite loyal to the Czech cause, the National Socialist Party lost its _raison d'être_. Owing to the great sufferings of the working class during the war, it became imbued with Socialist ideas.  On April 1, 1918, the Czech National Socialist Party held its eighth annual conference in Prague, at which it adopted a resolution endorsing international Socialism and changing its name to \"The Czech Socialist Party.\" The conference was attended also by two representatives of the Czecho-Slav Social Democratic Party, J. Stivin and deputy Nemec. The National Socialist leader, deputy Klofác, welcomed the representatives of the Social Democrats \"whom we have for years past been struggling against, but with whom the trials of this war have united us.\" He declared that his party accepted the Socialist programme and would join the new Socialist International. On September 6, 1918, the executive committees of the two parties elected a joint council. Its object is to work for the consolidation of the Czech working classes and for the formation of a united Czech Labour Party, composed of Social Democrats as well as of the former National Socialists. A similar process of consolidation is taking place also among the other parties, so that soon there will probably be only three Czech parties, on the basis of class difference, viz. Socialists, Agrarians and Democratic Nationalists (_bourgeoisie_), all of whom will stand behind the programme of full Czecho-Slovak independence.  The most significant demonstration of the Czech national sentiment took place at Prague on January 6, 1918, at a meeting of all the Czech deputies of the Reichsrat and of the diets of Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia, with which we deal in another chapter, and at which a resolution was unanimously carried demanding full independence and representation at the peace conference.  Finally, on July 13, 1918, a National Council or Committee was formed in Prague on which all the parties are represented and which may rightly be described as part of the Provisional Government of Bohemia.  The whole Czech nation to-day is unanimously awaiting the victory of the Entente, from which it expects its long-cherished independence. The Czecho-Slovaks are only waiting for a favorable opportunity to strike the death-blow at the Dual Monarchy.    IV  TERRORISM IN BOHEMIA DURING THE WAR  Austria-Hungary declared war not only on her enemies outside her frontiers, but also on her internal enemies, on her own Slav and Latin subjects. From the very first day of war terrorism reigned supreme in Bohemia, where the Austrian Government behaved as in an enemy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],["title","Independent Bohemia (#8)"],["body",". Three political parties (the National Socialist, Radical and Realist Parties) were dissolved and their organs suppressed. Fully three-quarters of all Czech journals and all Slovak journals were suspended. Political leaders were arrested, imprisoned, and some of them even sentenced to death. Many leaders have been imprisoned as hostages in case an insurrection should break out. Over 20,000 Czech civilians have been interned merely for being \"politically suspect,\" and about 5000 were hanged in an arbitrary way by military tribunals, since juries had been abolished by an imperial decree. Other Slav districts were no better off: the Polish Socialist deputy Daszynski stated in the Reichsrat that 30,000 persons were hanged in Galicia alone, and another deputy stated that the number of Slavs (Austrian subjects) who were executed by Austria exceeded 80,000. Czech troops were marched to the trains watched by German soldiers like prisoners of war. Thousands of them were massacred at the front. The property of those who surrendered was confiscated, while the families of those Czech leaders who escaped abroad were brutally persecuted. It is impossible for us to give a detailed description of all the persecutions committed by Austria on the Czecho-Slovaks, but the following is a brief summary of them:--  _(a) Czech Deputies and Leaders imprisoned and sentenced to Death_  The most important perhaps was _the case of Dr. Kramár,_ one of the most moderate of the Czech leaders. Dr. Kramár was arrested on May 21, 1915, on a charge of high treason as the leader of the Young Czechs; together with him were also arrested his colleague, deputy Dr. Rasín, Mr. Cervinka, an editor of the _Národní Listy_, and Zamazal, an accountant. On June 3, 1916, all four of them were sentenced to death, although no substantial proofs were produced against them. Subsequently, however, the sentence was commuted to long terms of imprisonment, but after the general amnesty of July, 1917, they were released. Among the reasons for which they were imprisoned and sentenced to death were the following, as given in the official announcement, published in the Austrian press on January 4, 1917:  Dr. Kramár before the war was \"the leader of Pan-Slav propaganda and of the Russophil movement in Bohemia.\" He was also alleged to have kept up a connection with the pro-Ally propaganda conducted by the Czecho-Slovaks and their friends abroad during the war, and the Czech military action against Austria on the side of the Entente. Dr. Kramár was further blamed for the \"treasonable\" behaviour of Czech regiments who voluntarily surrendered to Russia and Serbia, and for the anti-German sentiments cherished by the Czecho-Slovaks for centuries past. Obviously in striking Dr. Kramár Austria meant to strike at the Czech nation. The \"proofs\" for the high treasonable activity of Dr. Kramár before and during the war were the following:[1]  (1) Dr. Kramár was (before the war) in communication with Brancianov, Bobrinski, Denis, Masaryk, Pavlu and others, who now preach the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary.  (2) In his articles in the _Národní Listy_, published during the war, Dr. Kramár advocated the liberation of small nations as proclaimed by the Entente. His organ, \"the _Národní Listy_, laid special stress on news favourable to our enemies and on the state of disruption of Austria, and indirectly invited Czechs to passive resistance.\"  (3) A copy of _La Nation Tchèque_ was found in Dr. Kramár's pocket at the time of his arrest.  (4) Dr. Kramár had a conversation with the Italian consul in April, 1915, which is \"an important cause of suspicion.\"  (5) In a letter to the Governor of Bohemia, Prince Thun, Dr. Kramár admitted that, always faithful to his political principles, he refrained from everything that might appear as approval of the war.  This was the evidence brought up against Kramár, on the ground of which he was to be hanged. These are the \"proofs\" of his responsibility for the distribution of treasonable Russian proclamations in Bohemia, repeated manifestations of sympathy with the enemy, and the refusal of Czech deputies to take part in any declarations or manifestations of loyalty.  Equally characteristic is also _the case of the National Socialist leader, deputy Klofác_, who was arrested in September, 1914. Owing to lack of proofs the trial was repeatedly postponed, while Klofác was left in prison. A formal charge was brought against him only when the Reichsrat was about to open in May, 1917, so as to prevent him from attending the meeting. Nevertheless he was released after the amnesty of July, 1917. Writing in the _Národní Politika_ about his experience in prison, deputy Klofác says:      \"Many educated and aged political prisoners were not allowed out to     walk in the yard for five months or more, which is contrary to all     regulations. They were also not allowed to read books given to them by     the judge, and they had to do the lowest work. One student who refused     to wash the floor was beaten and confined to a dark cell. No wonder     that many committed suicide. Dr. Vrbenský could tell how he used to get     excited by the cry of the ill-treated prisoners. Even his nerves could     not stand it. It is quite comprehensible, therefore, that Dr. Scheiner     (the president of the 'Sokol' Union) in such an atmosphere was     physically and mentally broken down in two months. Dr. Kramár and Dr.     Rasín also had an opportunity of feeling the brutality of Polatchek and     Teszinski. In the winter we suffered from frosts, for there was no     heating. Some of my friends had frozen hands. We resisted the cold by     drilling according to the Müller system. This kept us fit and saved us     from going to the prison doctor, Dr. A. Prinz, who was a Magyar and     formerly a doctor in Karlsbad. If a prisoner went to this 'gentleman,'     he did not ask after his illness, but after his nationality, and for     the reason of his remand imprisonment. On hearing that a prisoner was     Czech and on remand for Par. 58_c_ (high treason), he only hissed: 'You     do not want any medicine. It would be wasted, for in any case you will     be hanged.'\"  Besides Klofác, the following four National Socialist deputies were also imprisoned: Choc, Burival, Vojna and Netolický. The accused were condemned on July 30, 1916, for \"failing to denounce Professor Masaryk's revolutionary propaganda.\"  _Professor Masaryk_, who escaped abroad in 1915, was sentenced to death in Austria in December, 1916. Unable to reach him, the Austrian Government revenged themselves on his daughter, Dr. Alice Masaryk, whom they imprisoned. Only after an energetic press campaign abroad was she released. A similar fate also met the wife of another Czech leader, Dr. Benes, who escaped abroad in the autumn of 1915 and became secretary general of the Czecho-Slovak National Council.  _Dr. Scheiner_, president of the \"Sokol\" Gymnastic Association, was imprisoned, but was again released owing to lack of proofs. A similar fate also met the Czech Social Democratic leader _Dr. Soukup_, who was for some time kept in prison.  _(b) Monster Trials, Arbitrary Executions, Internment of Civilians, etc_.  A notorious reason for imprisonment, and even execution, was the possession of the so-called Russian Manifesto dropped by Russian aeroplanes, being a proclamation of the Tsar to the people of Bohemia promising them the restoration of their independence. Mr. Matejovský, of the Prague City Council, and fifteen municipal clerks were sentenced to many years' imprisonment for this offence in February, 1915. In May, 1915, six persons, among them two girls, were condemned to death in Kyjov, Moravia, for the same offence. On the same charge also sixty-nine other persons from Moravia were brought to Vienna and fifteen of them sentenced to death. One of the Czech girls who were executed for this offence was a Miss Kotíková, aged twenty-one, who, according to the _Arbeiter Zeitung_ of September 8, 1917, refused to say from whom she had received the manifesto, and through her heroic attitude saved the lives of others.  Without a fair trial and without evidence, the editor of the National Socialist organ _Pokrok_ in Prostejov, Mr. Joseph Kotek, was sentenced to death on Christmas Eve of 1914. The sentence was passed at noon, confirmed at half-past four and carried out at half-past six. As no one could be found to act as hangman, Kotek was shot. The reason given for the verdict was that the accused editor of the _Pokrok_, which was suppressed as being dangerous to the State, delivered a speech at a meeting of a co-operative society in which he said that all Czechs were unanimous that they knew that Austria was losing the war and that they prayed to God that her downfall might be soon. He was further alleged to have said that it was doubtful how Europe would be divided after the war, but that in any case the Czecho-Slovak countries would be made independent as a wedge between Germany and Austria, and that if Germany won the Czechs would be germanised, like the Poles in Germany. The accused admitted that he did speak about the reorganisation of Europe, but not in the words used by the prosecution. But, as the _Arbeiter Zeitung_ said, even if he did say what the prosecution alleged, as a civilian he should never have been sentenced to death by a military tribunal. According to Czech papers, Kotek was buried among ordinary criminals outside the cemetery. The grave of the innocent martyr was not even marked with his name, and his wife was not allowed to visit it, because the military authorities forbade the sexton of the church to allow any one to see the graves of those executed for high treason.  _Dr. Preiss_, the manager of the Czech bank, Zivnostenská Banka, which has its branches in Galicia, Rumania, Serbia and elsewhere, and four of his colleagues were imprisoned, because the Czechs would not subscribe to Austrian war loans and Dr. "]]]
