Between you and me, Mr. Viner, this is a very queer business. I'm quite prepared to believe the story that young fellow Hyde tells. I wish he'd told it straight out in court. But you must see that he's in a very dangerous position--very dangerous indeed! The police, of course, won't credit a word of his tale--not they! They've got a strong _prima facie_ case against him, and they'll follow it up for all they're worth. The real thing to do, if you're to save him, is to find the real murderer. And to do that, you'll need all your wits! If one only had some theory!\"  Viner introduced Mr. Pawle to Miss Penkridge with the remark that she was something of an authority in mysteries, and as soon as they had sat down to lunch, told her of Langton Hyde and his statement.  \"Just so!\" said Miss Penkridge dryly. \"That's much more likely to be the real truth than that this lad killed Ashton. There's a great deal more in this murder than is on the surface, and I dare say Mr. Pawle agrees with me.\"  \"I dare say I do,\" assented Mr. Pawle. \"The difficulty is--how to penetrate into the thick cloak of mystery.\"  \"When I was round there, at Number Seven, this morning,\" observed Miss Penkridge, \"those two talked very freely to me about Mr. Ashton. Now, there's one thing struck me at once--there must be men in London who knew him. He couldn't go out and about, as he evidently did, without meeting men. Even if it wasn't in business, he'd meet men somewhere. And if I were you, I should invite men who knew him to come forward and tell what they know.\"  \"It shall be done--very good advice, ma'am,\" said Mr. Pawle.  \"And there's another thing,\" said Miss Penkridge. \"I should find out what can be told about Mr. Ashton where he came from. I believe you can get telegraphic information from Australia within a few hours. Why not go to the expense--when there's so much at stake? Depend upon it, the real secret of this murder lies back in the past--perhaps the far past.\"  \"That too shall be done,\" agreed Mr. Pawle. \"I shouldn't be surprised if you're right.\"  \"In my opinion,\" remarked Miss Penkridge, dryly, \"the robbing of this dead man was all a blind. Robbery wasn't the motive. Murder was the thing in view! And why? It may have been revenge. It may be that Ashton had to be got out of the way. And I shouldn't wonder a bit if that isn't at the bottom of it, which is at the top and bottom of pretty nearly everything!\"  \"And that, ma'am?\" asked Mr. Pawle, who evidently admired Miss Penkridge's shrewd observations, \"that is what, now?\"  \"Money!\" said Miss Penkridge. \"Money!\"  The old solicitor went away, promising to get to work on the lines suggested by Miss Penkridge, and next day he telephoned to Viner asking him to go down to his offices in Bedford Row. Viner hurried off, and on arriving found Mr. Pawle with a cablegram before him.  \"I sent a pretty long message to Melbourne, to Ashton's old bankers, as soon as I left you yesterday,\" he said. \"I gave them the news of his murder, and asked for certain information. Here's their answer. I rang you up as soon as I got it.\"  Viner read the cablegram carefully:  Deeply regret news. Ashton well known here thirty years dealer in real estate. Respected, wealthy. Quiet man, bachelor. Have made inquiries in quarters likely to know. Cannot trace anything about friend named Wickham. Ashton was away from Melbourne, up country, four years, some years ago. May have known Wickham then. Ashton left here end July, by _Maraquibo_, for London. Was accompanied by two friends Fosdick and Stephens. Please inform if can do more.  \"What do you think of that?\" asked Mr. Pawle. \"Not much in it, is there?\"  \"There's the mention of two men who might know something of Ashton's habits,\" said Viner. \"If Fosdick and Stephens are still in England and were Ashton's friends, one would naturally conclude that he'd seen them sometimes. Yet we haven't heard of their ever going to his house.\"  \"We can be quite certain that they never did--from what the two ladies say,\" remarked Mr. Pawle. \"Perhaps they don't live in London. I'll advertise for both. But now, here's another matter. I asked these people if they could tell me anything about Wickham, the father of this girl to whom Ashton's left his very considerable fortune. Well, you see, they can't. Now, it's a very curious thing, but Miss Wickham has no papers, has, in fact, nothing whatever to prove her identity. Nor have I. Ashton left nothing of that sort. I know no more, and she knows no more, than what he told both of us--that her father died when she was a mere child, her mother already being dead, that the father left her in Ashton's guardianship, and that Ashton, after sending her here to school, eventually came and took her to live with him. There isn't a single document really to show who she is, who her father was, or anything about her family.\"  \"Is that very important?\" asked Viner.  \"It's decidedly odd!\" said Mr. Pawle. \"This affair seems to be getting more mysterious than ever.\"  \"What's to be done next?\" inquired Viner.  \"Well, the newspapers are always very good about that,\" answered the solicitor. \"I'm getting them to insert paragraphs asking the two men, Fosdick and Stephens, to come forward and tell us if they've seen anything of Ashton since he came to England; I'm also asking if anybody can tell us where Ashton was when he went away from home on that visit that Mrs. Killenhall spoke of. If--\"  Just then a clerk came into Mr. Pawle's room, and bending down to him, whispered a few words which evidently occasioned him great surprise.  \"At once!\" he said. \"Bring them straight in, Parkinson. God bless me!\" he exclaimed, turning to Viner. \"Here are the two men in question--Fosdick and Stephens! Saw our name in the paper as Ashton's solicitors and want to see me urgently.\"     CHAPTER VII  WHAT WAS THE SECRET?   The two men who were presently ushered in were typical Colonials--big, hefty fellows as yet in early middle age, alert, evidently prosperous, if their attire and appointments were anything to go by, and each was obviously deeply interested in the occasion of his visit to Mr. Pawle. Two pairs of quick eyes took in the old solicitor and his companion, and the elder of the men came forward in a businesslike manner.  \"Mr. Pawle, I understand?\" he said. \"I'm Mr. Fosdick, of Melbourne, Victoria; this is my friend Mr. Stephens, same place.\"  \"Take a seat, Mr. Fosdick--have this chair, Mr. Stephens,\" responded Mr. Pawle. \"You wish to see me--on business?\"  \"That's so,\" answered Fosdick as the two men seated themselves by the solicitor's desk. \"We saw your name in the newspapers this morning in connection with the murder of John Ashton. Now, we knew John Ashton--he was a Melbourne man, too--and we can tell something about him. So we came to you instead of the police. Because, Mr. Pawle, what we can tell is maybe more a matter for a lawyer than for a policeman. It's mysterious.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Pawle, \"I'll be frank with you. I recognized your names as soon as my clerk announced them. Here's a cablegram which I have just received from Melbourne--you'll see your names mentioned in it.\"  The two callers bent over the cablegram, and Fosdick looked up and nodded.  \"Yes, that's right,\" he said. \"We came over with John Ashton in the _Maraquibo_. We knew him pretty well before that--most folk in Melbourne did. But of course, we were thrown into his company on board ship rather more than we'd ever been before. And we very much regret to hear of what's happened to him.\"  \"You say there is something you can tell?\" observed Mr. Pawle. \"If it's anything that will help to solve the mystery of this murder,--for there is a mystery,--I shall be very glad to hear it.\"  Fosdick and Stephens glanced at each other and then at Viner, who sat a little in Mr. Pawle's rear.  \"Partner of yours?\" asked Fosdick.  \"Not at all! This gentleman,\" replied Mr. Pawle, \"is Mr. Viner. It was he who found Ashton's dead body. They were neighbours.\"  \"Well, you found the body of a very worthy man, sir,\" remarked Fosdick gravely. \"And we'd like to do something toward finding the man who killed him. For we don't think it was this young fellow who's charged with it, nor that robbery was the motive. We think John Ashton was--removed. Put out of the way!\"  \"Why, now?\" asked Mr. Pawle.  \"I'll tell you,\" replied Fosdick. \"My friend Stephens, here, is a man of few words; he credits me with more talkativeness than he'll lay claim to. So I'm to tell the tale. There mayn't be much in it, and there may be a lot. We think there's a big lot! But this is what it comes to: Ashton was a close man, a reserved man. However, one night, when the three of us were having a quiet cigar in a corner of the smoking saloon in the _Maraquibo_, he opened out to us a bit. We'd been talking about getting over to England--we'd all three emigrated, you'll understand, when we were very young--and the talk ran on what we'd do. Fosdick and Stephens, d'ye see, were only on a visit,--which is just coming to an end, Mr. Pawle; we sail home in a day or two,--but Ashton was turning home for good. And he said to us, in a sort of burst of confidence, that he'd have plenty to do when he landed. He said that he was in possession--sole possession--of a most extraordinary secret, the revelation of which would affect one of the first families in England, and he was going to bring it out as soon as he'd got settled down in London.

WAY OF THE LAWLESS  Max Brand  1921  Previous ed. published under title: Free Range     WAY OF THE LAWLESS     CHAPTER 1   Beside the rear window of the blacksmith shop Jasper Lanning held his withered arms folded against his chest. With the dispassionate eye and the aching heart of an artist he said to himself that his life work was a failure. That life work was the young fellow who swung the sledge at the forge, and truly it was a strange product for this seventy-year-old veteran with his slant Oriental eyes and his narrow beard of white. Andrew Lanning was not even his son, but it came about in this way that Andrew became the life work of Jasper.  Fifteen years before, the father of Andy died, and Jasper rode out of the mountain desert like a hawk dropping out of the pale-blue sky. He buried his brother without a tear, and then sat down and looked at the slender child who bore his name. Andy was a beautiful boy. He had the black hair and eyes, the well-made jaw, and the bone of the Lannings, and if his mouth was rather soft and girlish he laid the failing to the weakness of childhood. Jasper had no sympathy for tenderness in men. His own life was as littered with hard deeds as the side of a mountain with boulders. But the black, bright eyes and the well-made jaw of little Andy laid hold on him, and he said to himself: \"I'm fifty-five. I'm about through with my saddle days. I'll settle down and turn out one piece of work that'll last after I'm gone, and last with my signature on it!\"  That was fifteen years ago. And for fifteen years he had labored to make Andy a man according to a grim pattern which was known in the Lanning clan, and elsewhere in the mountain desert. His program was as simple as the curriculum of a Persian youth. On the whole, it was even simpler, for Jasper concentrated on teaching the boy how to ride and shoot, and was not at all particular that he should learn to speak the truth. But on the first two and greatest articles of his creed, how Jasper labored!  For fifteen years he poured his heart without stint into his work! He taught Andy to know a horse from hock to teeth, and to ride anything that wore hair. He taught him to know a gun as if it were a sentient thing. He taught him all the draws of old and new pattern, and labored to give him both precision and speed. That was the work of fifteen years, and now at the end of this time the old man knew that his life work was a failure, for he had made the hand of Andrew Lanning cunning, had given his muscles strength, but the heart beneath was wrong.  It was hard to see Andy at the first glance. A film of smoke shifted and eddied through the shop, and Andy, working the bellows, was a black form against the square of the door, a square filled by the blinding white of the alkali dust in the road outside and the blinding white of the sun above. Andy turned from the forge, bearing in his tongs a great bar of iron black at the ends but white in the middle. The white place was surrounded by a sparkling radiance. Andy caught up an eight-pound hammer, and it rose and fell lightly in his hand. The sparks rushed against the leather apron of the hammer wielder, and as the blows fell rapid waves of light were thrown against the face of Andrew.  Looking at that face one wondered how the life work of Jasper was such a failure. For Andy was a handsome fellow with his blue-black hair and his black, rather slanting eyes, after the Lanning manner. Yet Jasper saw, and his heart was sick. The face was a little too full; the square bone of the chin was rounded with flesh; and, above all, the mouth had never changed. It was the mouth of the child, soft--too womanly soft. And Jasper blinked.  When he opened his eyes again the white place on the iron had become a dull red, and the face of the blacksmith was again in shadow. All Jasper could see was the body of Andy, and that was much better. Red light glinted on the sinewy arms and the swaying shoulders, and the hammer swayed and fell tirelessly. For fifteen years Jasper had consoled himself with the strength of the boy, smooth as silk and as durable; the light form which would not tire a horse, but swelled above the waist into those formidable shoulders.  Now the bar was lifted from the anvil and plunged, hissing, into the bucket beside the forge; above the bucket a cloud of steam rose and showed clearly against the brilliant square of the door, and the peculiar scent which came from the iron went sharply to the nostrils of Jasper. He got up as a horseman entered the shop. He came in a manner that pleased Jasper. There was a rush of hoofbeats, a form darting through the door, and in the midst of the shop the rider leaped out of the saddle and the horse came to a halt with braced legs.  \"Hey, you!\" called the rider as he tossed the reins over the head of his horse. \"Here's a hoss that needs iron on his feet. Fix him up. And look here\"--he lifted a forefoot and showed the scales on the frog and sole of the hoof--\"last time you shoed this hoss you done a sloppy job, son. You left all this stuff hangin' on here. I want it trimmed off nice an' neat. You hear?\"  The blacksmith shrugged his shoulders.  \"Spoils the hoof to put the knife on the sole, Buck,\" said the smith. \"That peels off natural.\"  \"H'm,\" said Buck Heath. \"How old are you, son?\"  \"Oh, old enough,\" answered Andy cheerily. \"Old enough to know that this exfoliation is entirely natural.\"  The big word stuck in the craw of Buck Heath, who brought his thick eyebrows together. \"I've rid horses off and on come twenty-five years,\" he declared, \"and I've rid 'em long enough to know how I want 'em shod. This is my hoss, son, and you do it my way. That straight?\"  The eye of old Jasper in the rear of the shop grew dim with wistfulness as he heard this talk. He knew Buck Heath; he knew his kind; in his day he would have eaten a dozen men of such rough words and such mild deeds as Buck. But searching the face of Andy, he saw no resentment. Merely a quiet resignation.  \"Another thing,\" said Buck Heath, who seemed determined to press the thing to a disagreeable point. \"I hear you don't fit your shoes on hot. Well?\"  \"I never touch a hoof with hot iron,\" replied Andy. \"It's a rotten practice.\"  \"Is it?\" said Buck Heath coldly. \"Well, son, you fit my hoss with hot shoes or I'll know the reason why.\"  \"I've got to do the work my own way,\" protested Andy.  A spark of hope burned in the slant eyes of Jasper.  \"Otherwise I can go find another gent to do my shoein'?\" inquired Buck.  \"It looks that way,\" replied the blacksmith with a nod.  \"Well,\" said Buck, whose mildness of the last question had been merely the cover for a bursting wrath that now sent his voice booming, \"maybe you know a whole pile, boy--I hear Jasper has give you consid'able education--but what you know is plumb wasted on me. Understand? As for lookin' up another blacksmith, you ought to know they ain't another shop in ten miles. You'll do this job, and you'll do it my way. Maybe you got another way of thinkin'?\"  There was a little pause.  \"It's your horse,\" repeated Andy. \"I suppose I can do him your own way.\"  Old Jasper closed his eyes in silent agony. Looking again, he saw Buck Heath grinning with contempt, and for a single moment Jasper touched his gun. Then he remembered that he was seventy years old. \"Well, Buck?\" he said, coming forward. For he felt that if this scene continued he would go mad with shame.  There was a great change in Buck as he heard this voice, a marked respect was in his manner as he turned to Jasper. \"Hello, Jas,\" he said. \"I didn't know you was here.\"  \"Come over to the saloon, Buck, and have one on me,\" said Jasper. \"I guess Andy'll have your hoss ready when we come back.\"  \"Speakin' personal,\" said Buck Heath with much heartiness, \"I don't pass up no chances with no man, and particular if he's Jasper Lanning.\" He hooked his arm through Jasper's elbow. \"Besides, that boy of yours has got me all heated up. Where'd he learn them man-sized words, Jas?\"  All of which Andy heard, and he knew that Buck Heath intended him to hear them. It made Andy frown, and for an instant he thought of calling Buck back. But he did not call. Instead he imagined what would happen. Buck would turn on his heel and stand, towering, in the door. He would ask what Andy wanted. Andy chose the careful insult which he would throw in Buck's face. He saw the blow given. He felt his own fist tingle as he returned the effort with interest. He saw Buck tumble back over the bucket of water.  By this time Andy was smiling gently to himself. His wrath had dissolved, and he was humming pleasantly to himself as he began to pull off the worn shoes of Buck's horse.     CHAPTER 2   Young Andrew Lanning lived in the small, hushed world of his own thoughts. He neither loved nor hated the people around him. He simply did not see them. His mother--it was from her that he inherited the softer qualities of his mind and his face--had left him a little stock of books. And though Andy was by no means a reader, he had at least picked up that dangerous equipment of fiction which enables a man to dodge reality and live in his dreams. Those dreams had as little as possible to do with the daily routine of his life, and certainly the handling of guns, which his uncle enforced upon him, was never a part of the future as Andy saw it.  It was now the late afternoon; the alkali dust in the road was still in a white light, but the temperature in the shop had dropped several degrees. The horse of Buck Heath was shod, and Andy was laying his tools away for the day when he heard the noise of an automobile with open muffler coming down the street. He stepped to the door to watch, and at that moment a big blue car trundled into view around the bend of the road. The rear wheels struck a slide of sand and dust, and skidded; a girl cried out; then the big machine gathered out of the cloud of dust,"]]]
