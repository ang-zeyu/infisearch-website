What's happened?--tell me, one of you?\"  The detective purposely kept himself and Lauriston between Zillah and the open door at the rear of the shop. He made a kindly motion of his head towards her.  \"Now, my dear!\" he said. \"Don't get upset--your grandfather was getting a very old man, you know--and we can't expect old gentlemen to live for ever. Take it quietly, now!\"  The girl turned and laid her flowers and parcels on the counter. Lauriston, watching her anxiously, saw that she was nerving herself to be brave.  \"That means--he's dead?\" she said. \"I am quiet--you see I'm quiet. Tell me what's happened--you tell me,\" she added, glancing at Lauriston. \"Tell me--now!\"  \"I came in and found no one here, and I looked round through the door into the parlour there,\" answered Lauriston, \"and I saw your grandfather lying on the floor. So I jumped over the counter and went to him.\"  Zillah moved forward as if to go into the parlour. But the detective stopped her, glancing from her to Lauriston.  \"You know this young man, Miss Wildrose?\" he asked. \"You've met him before?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Zillah, confidently. \"He's Mr. Lauriston. Let me go in there, please. Can nothing be done?\"  But Ayscough only shook his head. There was nothing to be done--but to await the arrival of the doctor. They followed the girl into the parlour and stood by while she bent over the dead man. She made no demonstration of grief, and when Ayscough presently suggested that she should go upstairs until the doctor had come, she went quietly away.  \"Hadn't we better lift him on that sofa?\" suggested Lauriston.  \"Not till our people and the police-surgeon have seen him,\" answered Ayscough, shaking his head. \"I want to know all about this--he may have died a natural death--a seizure of some sort--and again, he mayn't--They'll be here in a minute.\"  Lauriston presently found himself a passive spectator while a police-inspector, another man in plain clothes, and the doctor examined the body, after hearing Ayscough's account of what had just happened. He was aware that he was regarded with suspicion--the inspector somewhat brusquely bade him stay where he was: it would, indeed, have been impossible to leave, for there was a policeman at the door, in which, by his superior's orders, he had turned the key. And there was a general, uncomfortable sort of silence in the place while the doctor busied himself about the body.  \"This man has been assaulted!\" said the doctor, suddenly turning to the inspector. \"Look here!--he's not only been violently gripped by the right arm--look at that bruise--but taken savagely by the throat. There's no doubt of that. Old and evidently feeble as he was, the shock would be quite enough to kill him. But--that's how it's been done, without a doubt.\"  The inspector turned, looking hard at Lauriston.  \"Did you see anybody leaving the place when you entered?\" he asked.  \"There was no one about here when I came in--either at the street door or at the side door,\" replied Lauriston, readily. \"The whole place was quiet--deserted--except for him. And--he was dead when I found him.\"  The inspector drew Ayscough aside and they talked in whispers for a few minutes, eyeing Lauriston now and then; eventually they approached him.  \"I understand you're known here, and that you live in the neighbourhood,\" said the inspector. \"You'll not object if the sergeant goes round with you to your lodgings--you'll no doubt be able to satisfy him about your respectability, and so on. I don't want to suggest anything--but--you understand?\"  \"I understand,\" replied Lauriston. \"I'll show or tell him anything he likes. I've told you the plain truth.\"  \"Go with him now,\" directed the inspector; \"you know what to do, Ayscough!\"  Half an hour later, when the dead man had been carried to his room, and the shop and house had been closed, Melky Rubinstein, who had come in while the police were still there, and had remained when they had gone, stood talking to Zillah in the upstairs sitting-room. Melky was unusually grave: Zillah had already gathered that the police had some suspicion about Lauriston.  \"I'll go round there and see what the detective fellow's doing with him,\" said Melky. \"I ain't got no suspicion about him--not me! But--it's an awkward position--and them rings, too! Now, if he'd only ha' shown 'em to me, first, Zillah--see?\"  \"Do go, Melky!\" urged Zillah tearfully. \"Of course, he'd nothing to do with it. Oh!--I wish I'd never gone out!\"  Melky went downstairs. He paused for a moment in the little parlour, glancing meditatively at the place where the old man had been found dead. And suddenly his keen eyes saw an object which lay close to the fender, half hidden by a tassel of the hearthrug, and he stooped and picked it up--a solitaire stud, made of platinum, and ornamented with a curious device.    CHAPTER FIVE   THE TWO LETTERS  Once outside the shop, Lauriston turned sharply on the detective.  \"Look here!\" he said. \"I wish you'd just tell me the truth. Am I suspected? Am I--in some way or other--in custody?\"  Ayscough laughed quietly, wagging his head.  \"Certainly not in custody,\" he answered. \"And as to the other--well, you know, Mr. Lauriston, supposing we put it in this way?--suppose you'd been me, and I'd been you, half-an-hour ago? What would you have thought if you'd found me in the situation and under the circumstances in which I found you? Come, now!\"  \"Yes,\" replied Lauriston, after a moment's reflection. \"I suppose it's natural that you should suspect me--finding me there, alone with the old man. But--\"  \"It's not so much suspicion in a case of this sort, as a wish to satisfy one's self,\" interrupted the detective. \"You seem a gentleman-like young fellow, and you may be all right. I want to know that you are--I'd like to know that you are! It would be no satisfaction to me to fasten this business on you, I can assure you. And if you like to tell me about yourself, and how you came to go to Multenius's--why, it would be as well.\"  \"There's not much to tell,\" answered Lauriston. \"I came from Scotland to London, two years ago or thereabouts, to earn my living by writing. I'd a bit of money when I came--I've lived on it till now. I've just begun to earn something. I've been expecting a cheque for some work for these last ten or twelve days, but I was running short last week--so I went to that place to pawn my watch--I saw the young lady there. As my cheque hadn't arrived today, I went there again to pawn those rings I told you about and showed you. And--that's all. Except this--I was advised to go to Multenius's by a relation of theirs, Mr. Rubinstein, who lodges where I do. He knows me.\"  \"Oh, Melky Rubinstein!\" said Ayscough. \"I know Melky--sharp chap he is. He sold me this pin I'm wearing. Well, that seems quite a straightforward tale, Mr. Lauriston. I've no doubt all will be satisfactory. You've friends in London, of course?\"  \"No--none,\" replied Lauriston. \"And scarcely an acquaintance. I've kept to myself--working hard: I've had no time--nor inclination, either--to make friends. Here's the house where I lodge--it's not much of a place, but come in.\"  They had reached Mrs. Flitwick's house by that time, and Mrs. Flitwick herself was in the narrow, shabby passage as they entered. She immediately produced two letters.  \"Here's two letters for you, Mr. Lauriston,\" she said, with a sharp glance at Ayscough. \"One of 'em's a registered--I did sign for it. So I kept 'em myself, instead of sending 'em up to your room.\"  \"Thank you, Mrs. Flitwick,\" said Lauriston. He took the letters, saw that the writing on the registered envelope was his old friend John Purdie's, and that the other letter was from the magazine to which he had sold his stories, and turned to Ayscough. \"Come up to my room,\" he continued. \"We'll talk up there.\"  Ayscough followed him up to his room--once inside, and the door shut, Lauriston tore open the letter from the magazine, and extracted a printed form and a cheque for twenty guineas. He took one look at them and thrust them into the detective's hands.  \"There!\" he said, with a sigh of mingled relief and triumph. \"There's a proof of the truth of one statement I made to you! That's the expected cheque I told you of. Excuse me while I look at the other letter.\"  Out of the registered letter came a bank-note--for twenty pounds--and a hastily scribbled note which Lauriston eagerly read. \"Dear old Andie,\" it ran, \"I've only just got your letter, for I've been from home for a fortnight, and had no letters sent on to me. Of course you'll make me your banker until your book's finished--and afterwards, too, if need be. Here's something to be going on with--but I'm coming to London in a day or two, as it happens, and will go into the matter--I'll call on you as soon as I arrive. Excuse this scrawl--post time. Always yours, John Purdie.\"  Lauriston thrust that letter, too, into Ayscough's hands.  \"If I've no friends in London, there's proof of having one in my own country!\" he exclaimed. \"Ah!--if those letters had only come before I went off to Praed Street!\"  \"Just so!\" agreed the detective, glancing the letters and their accompaniments over. \"Well, I'm glad you're able to show me these, Mr. Lauriston, anyway. But now, about those rings--between you and me, I wish they hadn't been so much like those that were lying in that tray on the old man's table. It's an unfortunate coincidence!--because some folks might think, you know, that you'd just grabbed a couple of those as you left the place. Eh?\"  \"My rings have been in that trunk for two or three years,\" asserted Lauriston. \"They were my mother's, and I believe she'd had them for many a year before she died. They may resemble those that we saw in that tray, but--\"  \"Well, I suppose you can bring somebody--if necessary, that is--to prove that they were your mother's, can't you?\" asked Ayscough. \"That'll make matters all right--on that point. And as for the rest--it's very lucky you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9297"],["title","The Orange-Yellow Diamond (#5)"],["body"," Melky Rubinstein, and that the girl knew you as a customer. But, my faith!--I wish you'd caught a glimpse of somebody leaving that shop! For there's no doubt the old man met his death by violence.\"  \"I know nothing of it,\" said Lauriston, \"I saw no one.\"  Just then Melky came in. He glanced at the cheque and the bank-notes lying on the table, and nodded to Lauriston as if he understood their presence. Then he turned to Ayscough, almost anxiously.  \"I say, Mr. Ayscough!\" he said, deprecatingly. \"You ain't going to be so unkind as to mix up this here young fellow in what's happened. S'elp me, Mr. Ayscough, I couldn't believe anything o' that sort about him, nohow--nor would my cousin, Zillah, what you know well enough, neither; he's as quiet as a lamb, Mr. Ayscough, is Mr. Lauriston--ain't I known him, lodging here as he does, this many a month? I'll give my word for him, anyway, Mr. Ayscough! And you police gentlemen know me. Don't you now, Mr. Ayscough?\"  \"Very well indeed, my boy!\" agreed the detective, heartily. \"And I'll tell you what--I shall have to trouble Mr. Lauriston to go round with me to the station, just to give a formal account of what happened, and a bit of explanation, you know--I'm satisfied myself about him, and so, no doubt, will our people be, but you come with us, Melky, and say a word or two--say you've known him for some time, d'ye see--it'll help.\"  \"Anything to oblige a friend, Mr. Ayscough,\" said Melky. He motioned to Lauriston to put his money in his pocket. \"Glad to see your letters turned up,\" he whispered as they went downstairs. \"I say!--a word in your ear--don't you tell these here police chaps any more than you need--I'll stand up for you.\"  The detective's report, a little questioning of Lauriston, and Melky's fervent protestations on Lauriston's behalf, served to satisfy the authorities at the police-station, and Lauriston was allowed to go--admonished by the inspector that he'd be wanted at the inquest, as the most important witness. He went out into the street with Melky.  \"Come and have a bit o' supper at Mrs. Goldmark's,\" suggested Melky. \"I shall have my hands full tonight at the poor old man's, but I ain't had nothing since dinner.\"  Lauriston, however, excused himself. He wanted to go home and write letters--at once. But he promised to look round at the pawnshop later in the evening, to see if he could be of any use, and to give Melky a full account of his finding of the old pawnbroker.  \"Ah!\" remarked Melky, as they pushed at the door of the eating-house. \"And ain't it going to be a nice job to find the man that scragged him?--I don't think! But I'm going to take a hand at that game, mister!--let alone the police.\"  Mrs. Goldmark was out. She had heard the news, said the waitress who was left in charge, and had gone round to do what she could for Miss Zillah. So Melky, deprived of the immediate opportunity of talk with Mrs. Goldmark, ordered his supper, and while he ate and drank, cogitated and reflected. And his thoughts ran chiefly on the platinum solitaire stud which he had carefully bestowed in his vest pocket.  It was Melky's firm belief--already--that the stud had been dropped in Daniel Multenius's back parlour by some person who had no business there--in other words by the old man's assailant. And ever since he had found the stud, Melky had been wondering and speculating on his chances of finding its owner. Of one thing he was already certain: that the owner, whoever he was, was no ordinary person. Ordinary, everyday persons do not wear studs or tie-pins on chains made of platinum--the most valuable of all the metals. How came a solitaire stud, made of a metal far more valuable than gold, and designed and ornamented in a peculiar fashion, to be lying on the hearthrug of old Daniel Multenius's room? It was not to be believed that the old man had dropped it there--no, affirmed Melky to himself, with conviction, that bit of personal property had been dropped there, out of a loose shirt-cuff by some man who had called on Daniel not long before Andie Lauriston had gone in, and who for some mysterious reason had scragged the old fellow. And now the question was--who was that man?  \"Got to find that out, somehow!\" mused Melky. \"Else that poor chap'll be in a nice fix--s'elp me, he will! And that 'ud never do!\"  Melky, in spite of his keenness as a business man, and the fact that from boyhood he had had to fight the world by himself, had a peculiarly soft heart--he tended altogether to verge on the sentimental. He had watched Lauriston narrowly, and had developed a decided feeling for him--moreover, he now knew that his cousin Zillah, hitherto adamant to many admirers, had fallen in love with Lauriston: clearly, Lauriston must be saved. Melky knew police ways and methods, and he felt sure that whatever Ayscough, a good-natured man, might think, the superior authorities would view Lauriston's presence in the pawnshop with strong suspicion. Therefore--the real culprit must be found. And he, Melky Rubinstein--he must have a go at that game.  He finished his supper, thinking hard all the time he ate and drank; finally he approached the desk to pay his bill. The young woman whom Mrs. Goldmark had left in charge lifted the lid of the desk to get some change--and Melky's astonished eyes immediately fell on an object which lay on top of a little pile of papers. That object was the duplicate of the platinum solitaire which Melky had in his pocket. Without ceremony--being well known there--he at once picked it up.  \"What's this bit of jewellery?\" he demanded.  \"That?\" said the waitress, indifferently. \"Oh, one of the girls picked it up the other day off a table where a stranger had been sitting--we think he'd dropped it. Mrs. Goldmark says it's valuable, so she put it away, in case he comes again. But we haven't seen him since.\"  Melky took a good look at the second stud. Then he put it back in the desk, picked up his change, and went away--in significant silence.    CHAPTER SIX   THE SPANISH MANUSCRIPT  Lauriston, walking back to his room after leaving Melky at the door of the eating-house, faced the situation in which an unfortunate combination of circumstances had placed him. Ayscough had been placable enough; the authorities at the police-station had heard his own version of things with attention--but he was still conscious that he was under a certain amount of suspicion. More than that, he felt convinced that the police would keep an eye on him that night. Ayscough, indeed, had more than hinted that that would probably be done. For anything he knew, some plain-clothes man might be shadowing him even then--anyway, there had been no mistaking the almost peremptory request of the inspector that he should report himself at the police station in the morning. It was no use denying the fact--he was suspected, in some degree.  He knew where the grounds of suspicion lay--in his possession of two rings, which were undoubtedly very similar to the rings which lay in the tray that he and the detective had found on the table in the back-parlour of the pawnshop. It needed no effort on the part of one who had already had considerable experience in the construction of plots for stories, to see how the police would build up a theory of their own. Here, they would say, is a young fellow, who on his own confession, is so hard up, so penniless, indeed, that he has had to pawn his watch. He has got to know something of this particular pawnshop, and of its keepers--he watches the girl leave; he ascertains that the old man is alone; he enters, probably he sees that tray of rings lying about; he grabs a couple of the rings; the old man interrupts him in the act; he seizes the old man, to silence his outcries; the old man, feeble enough at any time, dies under the shock. A clear, an unmistakable case!  What was he, Lauriston, to urge against the acceptance of such a theory? He thought over everything that could be said on his behalf. The friendliness of Zillah and her cousin Melky towards him could be dismissed--that, when it came to it, would weigh little against the cold marshalling of facts which a keen legal mind would put into the opposite scale. His own contention that it was scarcely probable that he should have gone to the pawnshop except to pledge something, and that that something was the rings, would also be swept aside, easily enough: his real object, the other side would say, had been robbery when the old man was alone: what evidence had he that the two rings which he had in his hand when Ayscough found him hurrying out of the shop were really his?  Here, Lauriston knew he was in a difficulty. He had kept these two rings safely hidden in his old-fashioned trunk ever since coming to London, and had never shown them to a single person--he had, indeed, never seen them himself for a long time until he took them out that afternoon. But where was his proof of that! He had no relations to whom he could appeal. His mother had possessed an annuity; just sufficient to maintain her and her son, and to give Lauriston a good education: it had died with her, and all that she had left him, to start life on, was about two hundred pounds and some small personal belongings, of which the rings and his father's watch and chain were a part. And he remembered now that his mother had kept those rings as securely put away as he had kept them since her death--until they came into his hands at her death he had only once seen them; she had shown them to him when he was a boy and had said they were very valuable. Was it possible that there was any one, far away in Scotland, who had known his mother and who would come forward--if need arose--and prove that those rings had been her property? But when he had put this question to himself, he had to answer it with a direct negative--he knew of no one.  There was one gleam of hope in this critical situation. John Purdie was coming to London. Lauriston had always felt"]]]
