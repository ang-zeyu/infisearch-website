While the contest thus fared in that part of the field, the scheme of Ferdinand had succeeded so far as to break up the battle in detached sections.  Far and near, plain, grove, garden, tower, presented each the scene of obstinate and determined conflict.  Boabdil, at the head of his chosen guard, the flower of the haughtier tribe of nobles who were jealous of the fame and blood of the tribe of Muza, and followed also by his gigantic Ethiopians, exposed his person to every peril, with the desperate valour of a man who feels his own stake is greatest in the field.  As he most distrusted the infantry, so amongst the infantry he chiefly bestowed his presence; and wherever he appeared, he sufficed, for the moment, to turn the changes of the engagement.  At length, at mid-day Ponce de Leon led against the largest detachment of the Moorish foot a strong and numerous battalion of the best-disciplined and veteran soldiery of Spain.  He had succeeded in winning a fortress, from which his artillery could play with effect; and the troops he led were composed, partly of men flushed with recent triumph, and partly of a fresh reserve, now first brought into the field.  A comely and a breathless spectacle it was to behold this Christian squadron emerging from a blazing copse, which they fired on their march; the red light gleaming on their complete armour, as, in steady and solemn order, they swept on to the swaying and clamorous ranks of the Moorish infantry. Boabdil learned the danger from his scouts; and hastily quitting a tower from which he had for a while repulsed a hostile legion, he threw himself into the midst of the battalions menaced by the skilful Ponce de Leon. Almost at the same moment, the wild and ominous apparition of Almamen, long absent from the eyes of the Moors, appeared in the same quarter, so suddenly and unexpectedly, that none knew whence he had emerged; the sacred standard in his left hand--his sabre, bared and dripping gore, in his right--his face exposed, and its powerful features working with an excitement that seemed inspired; his abrupt presence breathed a new soul into the Moors.  \"They come! they come!\" he shrieked aloud.  \"The God of the East hath delivered the Goth into your hands!\"  From rank to rank--from line to line--sped the santon; and, as the mystic banner gleamed before the soldiery, each closed his eyes and muttered an \"amen\" to his adjurations. And now, to the cry of \"Spain and St. Iago,\" came trampling down the relentless charge of the Christian war.  At the same instant, from the fortress lately taken by Ponce de Leon, the artillery opened upon the Moors, and did deadly havoc.  The Moslems wavered a moment when before them gleamed the white banner of Almamen; and they beheld him rushing, alone and on foot, amidst the foe.  Taught to believe the war itself depended on the preservation of the enchanted banner, the Paynims could not see it thus rashly adventured without anxiety and shame: they rallied, advanced firmly, and Boabdil himself, with waving cimiter and fierce exclamations, dashed impetuously at the head of his guards and Ethiopians into the affray.  The battle became obstinate and bloody. Thrice the white banner disappeared amidst the closing ranks; and thrice, like a moon from the clouds, it shone forth again--the light and guide of the Pagan power.  The day ripened; and the hills already cast lengthening shadows over the blazing groves and the still Darro, whose waters, in every creek where the tide was arrested, ran red with blood, when Ferdinand, collecting his whole reserve, descended from the eminence on which hitherto he had posted himself.  With him moved three thousand foot and a thousand horse, fresh in their vigour, and panting for a share in that glorious day.  The king himself, who, though constitutionally fearless, from motives of policy rarely perilled his person, save on imminent occasions, was resolved not to be outdone by Boabdil; and armed cap-a-pied in mail, so wrought with gold that it seemed nearly all of that costly metal, with his snow-white plumage waving above a small diadem that surmounted his lofty helm, he seemed a fit leader to that armament of heroes.  Behind him flaunted the great gonfanon of Spain, and trump and cymbal heralded his approach.  The Count de Tendilla rode by his side.  \"Senor,\" said Ferdinand, \"the infidels fight hard; but they are in the snare--we are about to close the nets upon them.  But what cavalcade is this?\"  The group that thus drew the king's attention consisted of six squires, bearing, on a martial litter, composed of shields, the stalwart form of Hernando del Pulgar.  \"Ah, the dogs!\" cried the king, as he recognised the pale features of the darling of the army,--\"have they murdered the bravest knight that ever fought for Christendom?\"  \"Not that, your majesty,\" quoth he of the Exploits, faintly, \"but I am sorely stricken.\"  \"It must have been more than man who struck thee down,\" said the king.  \"It was the mace of Muza Ben Abil Gazan, an please you, sire,\" said one of the squires; \"but it came on the good knight unawares, and long after his own arm had seemingly driven away the Pagan.\"  \"We will avenge thee well,\" said the king, setting his teeth: \"let our own leeches tend thy wounds.  Forward, sir knights!  St. Iago and Spain!\"  The battle had now gathered to a vortex; Muza and his cavalry had joined Boabdil and the Moorish foot.  On the other hand, Villena had been reinforced by detachments that in almost every other quarter of the field had routed the foe.  The Moors had been driven back, though inch by inch; they were now in the broad space before the very walls of the city, which were still crowded by the pale and anxious faces of the aged and the women: and, at every pause in the artillery, the voices that spoke of HOME were borne by that lurid air to the ears of the infidels.  The shout that rang through the Christian force as Ferdinand now joined it struck like a death-knell upon the last hope of Boabdil.  But the blood of his fierce ancestry burned in his veins, and the cheering voice of Almamen, whom nothing daunted, inspired him with a kind of superstitious frenzy.  \"King against king--so be it!  Let Allah decide between us!\" cried the Moorish monarch.  \"Bind up this wound 'tis well!  A steed for the santon! Now, my prophet and my friend, mount by the side of thy king--let us, at least, fall together.  Lelilies!  Lelilies!\"  Throughout the brave Christian ranks went a thrill of reluctant admiration, as they beheld the Paynim king, conspicuous by his fair beard and the jewels of his harness, lead the scanty guard yet left to him once more into the thickest of their lines.  Simultaneously Muza and his Zegris made their fiery charge; and the Moorish infantry, excited by the example of their leaders, followed with unslackened and dogged zeal.  The Christians gave way--they were beaten back: Ferdinand spurred forward; and, ere either party were well aware of it, both kings met in the same melee: all order and discipline, for the moment, lost, general and monarch were, as common soldiers, fighting hand to hand.  It was then that Ferdinand, after bearing down before his lance Naim Reduon, second only to Muza in the songs of Granada, beheld opposed to him a strange form, that seemed to that royal Christian rather fiend than man: his raven hair and beard, clotted with blood, hung like snakes about a countenance whose features, naturally formed to give expression to the darkest passions, were distorted with the madness of despairing rage. Wounded in many places, the blood dabbled his mail; while, over his head, he waved the banner wrought with mystic characters, which Ferdinand had already been taught to believe the workmanship of demons.  \"Now, perjured king of the Nazarenes!\" shouted this formidable champion, \"we meet at last!--no longer host and guest, monarch and dervise, but man to man!  I am Almamen!  Die!\"  He spoke; and his sword descended so fiercely on that anointed head that Ferdinand bent to his saddle-bow.  But the king quickly recovered his seat, and gallantly met the encounter; it was one that might have tasked to the utmost the prowess of his bravest knight.  Passions which, in their number, their nature, and their excess, animated no other champion on either side, gave to the arm of Almamen the Israelite a preternatural strength; his blows fell like rain upon the harness of the king; and the fiery eyes, the gleaming banner of the mysterious sorcerer, who had eluded the tortures of his Inquisition,--who had walked unscathed through the midst of his army,--whose single hand had consumed the encampment of a host, filled the stout heart of a king with a belief that he encountered no earthly foe.  Fortunately, perhaps, for Ferdinand and Spain, the contest did not last long.  Twenty horsemen spurred into the melee to the rescue of the plumed diadem:  Tendilla arrived the first; with a stroke of his two-handed sword, the white banner was cleft from its staff, and fell to the earth.  At that sight the Moors round broke forth in a wild and despairing cry: that cry spread from rank to rank, from horse to foot; the Moorish infantry, sorely pressed on all sides, no sooner learned the disaster than they turned to fly: the rout was as fatal as it was sudden.  The Christian reserve, just brought into the field, poured down upon them with a simultaneous charge.  Boabdil, too much engaged to be the first to learn the downfall of the sacred insignia, suddenly saw himself almost alone, with his diminished Ethiopians and a handful of his cavaliers.  \"Yield thee, Boabdil el Chico!\" cried Tendilla, from his rear, \"or thou canst not be saved.\"  \"By the Prophet, never!\" exclaimed the king: and he dashed his barb against the wall of spears behind him; and with but a score or so of his guard,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9760"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book V. (#2)"],["body","his way through the ranks that were not unwilling, perhaps, to spare so brave a foe.  As he cleared the Spanish battalions, the unfortunate monarch checked his horse for a moment and gazed along the plain: he beheld his army flying in all directions, save in that single spot where yet glittered the turban of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.  As he gazed, he heard the panting nostrils of the chargers behind, and saw the levelled spears of a company despatched to take him, alive or dead, by the command of Ferdinand.  He laid the reins upon his horse's neck and galloped into the city--three lances quivered against the portals as he disappeared through the shadows of the arch.  But while Muza remained, all was not yet lost: he perceived the flight of the infantry and the king, and with his followers galloped across the plain: he came in time to encounter and slay, to a man, the pursuers of Boabdil; he then threw himself before the flying Moors:  \"Do ye fly in the sight of your wives and daughters?  Would ye not rather they beheld ye die?\"  A thousand voices answered him.  \"The banner is in the hands of the infidel--all is lost!\"  They swept by him, and stopped not till they gained the gates.  But still a small and devoted remnant of the Moorish cavaliers remained to shed a last glory over defeat itself.  With Muza, their soul and centre, they fought every atom of ground: it was, as the chronicler expresses it, as if they grasped the soil with their arms.  Twice they charged into the midst of the foe: the slaughter they made doubled their own number; but, gathering on and closing in, squadron upon squadron, came the whole Christian army--they were encompassed, wearied out, beaten back, as by an ocean.  Like wild beasts, driven, at length, to their lair, they retreated with their faces to the foe; and when Muza came, the last--his cimiter shivered to the hilt,--he had scarcely breath to command the gates to be closed and the portcullis lowered, ere he fell from his charger in a sudden and deadly swoon, caused less by his exhaustion than his agony and shame.  So ended the last battle fought for the Monarchy of Granada!     CHAPTER II.  THE NOVICE.  It was in one of the cells of a convent renowned for the piety of its inmates and the wholesome austerity of its laws that a young novice sat alone.  The narrow casement was placed so high in the cold grey wall as to forbid to the tenant of the cell the solace of sad or the distraction of pious thoughts, which a view of the world without might afford. Lovely, indeed, was the landscape that spread below; but it was barred from those youthful and melancholy eyes: for Nature might tempt to a thousand thoughts, not of a tenor calculated to reconcile the heart to an eternal sacrifice of the sweet human ties.  But a faint and partial gleam of sunshine broke through the aperture and made yet more cheerless the dreary aspect and gloomy appurtenances of the cell.  And the young novice seemed to carry on within herself that struggle of emotions without which there is no victory in the resolves of virtue: sometimes she wept bitterly, but with a low, subdued sorrow, which spoke rather of despondency than passion; sometimes she raised her head from her breast, and smiled as she looked upward, or as her eyes rested on the crucifix and the death's head that were placed on the rude table by the pallet on which she sat.  They were emblems of death here, and life hereafter, which, perhaps, afforded to her the sources of a twofold consolation.  She was yet musing, when a slight tap at the door was heard, and the abbess of the convent appeared.  \"Daughter,\" said she, \"I have brought thee the comfort of a sacred visitor.  The Queen of Spain, whose pious tenderness is maternally anxious for thy full contentment with thy lot, has sent hither a holy friar, whom she deems more soothing in his counsels than our brother Tomas, whose ardent zeal often terrifies those whom his honest spirit only desires to purify and guide.  I will leave him with thee.  May the saints bless his ministry!\"  So saying the abbess retired from the threshold, making way for a form in the garb of a monk, with the hood drawn over the face.  The monk bowed his head meekly, advanced into the cell, closed the door, and seated himself, on a stool--which, save the table and the pallet, seemed the sole furniture of the dismal chamber.  \"Daughter,\" said he, after a pause, \"it is a rugged and a mournful lot this renunciation of earth and all its fair destinies and soft affections, to one not wholly prepared and armed for the sacrifice. Confide in me, my child; I am no dire inquisitor, seeking to distort thy words to thine own peril.  I am no bitter and morose ascetic.  Beneath these robes still beats a human heart that can sympathise with human sorrows.  Confide in me without fear.  Dost thou not dread the fate they would force upon thee?  Dost thou not shrink back?  Wouldst thou not be free?\"  \"No,\" said the poor novice; but the denial came faint and irresolute from her lips.  \"Pause,\" said the friar, growing more earnest in his tone: \"pause--there is yet time.\"  \"Nay,\" said the novice, looking up with some surprise in her countenance; \"nay, even were I so weak, escape now is impossible.  What hand could unbar the gates of the convent?\"  \"Mine!\" cried the monk, with impetuosity.  \"Yes, I have that power.  In all Spain, but one man can save thee, and I am he.\"  \"You!\" faltered the novice, gazing at her strange visitor with mingled astonishment and alarm.  \"And who are you that could resist the fiat of that Tomas de Torquemada, before whom, they tell me, even the crowned heads of Castile and Arragon veil low?\"  The monk half rose, with an impatient and almost haughty start, at this interrogatory; but, reseating himself, replied, in a deep and half- whispered voice \"Daughter, listen to me!  It is true, that Isabel of Spain (whom the Mother of Mercy bless! for merciful to all is her secret heart, if not her outward policy)--it is true that Isabel of Spain, fearful that the path to Heaven might be made rougher to thy feet than it well need be (there was a slight accent of irony in the monk's voice as he thus spoke), selected a friar of suasive eloquence and gentle manners to visit thee.  He was charged with letters to yon abbess from the queen. Soft though the friar, he was yet a hypocrite.  Nay, hear me out! he loved to worship the rising sun; and he did not wish always to remain a simple friar, while the Church had higher dignities of this earth to bestow.  In the Christian camp, daughter, there was one who burned for tidings of thee,--whom thine image haunted--who, stern as thou wert to him, loved thee with a love he knew not of, till thou wert lost to him. Why dost thou tremble, daughter? listen, yet!  To that lover, for he was one of high birth, came the monk; to that lover the monk sold his mission.  The monk will have a ready tale, that he was waylaid amidst the mountains by armed men, and robbed of his letters to the abbess.  The lover took his garb, and he took the letters; and he hastened hither. Leila! beloved Leila! behold him at thy feet!\"  The monk raised his cowl; and, dropping on his knee beside her, presented to her gaze the features of the Prince of Spain.  \"You!\" said Leila, averting her countenance, and vainly endeavouring to extricate the hand which he had seized.  \"This is indeed cruel.  You, the author of so many sufferings--such calumny--such reproach!\"  \"I will repair all,\" said Don Juan, fervently.  \"I alone, I repeat it, have the power to set you free.  You are no longer a Jewess; you are one of our faith; there is now no bar upon our loves.  Imperious though my father,--all dark and dread as is this new POWER which he is rashly erecting in his dominions, the heir of two monarchies is not so poor in influence and in friends as to be unable to offer the woman of his love an inviolable shelter alike from priest and despot.  Fly with me!--quit this dreary sepulchre ere the last stone close over thee for ever!  I have horses, I have guards at hand.  This night it can be arranged.  This night--oh, bliss!--thou mayest be rendered up to earth and love!\"  \"Prince,\" said Leila, who had drawn herself from Juan's grasp during this address, and who now stood at a little distance erect and proud, \"you tempt me in vain; or, rather you offer me no temptation.  I have made my choice; I abide by it.\"  \"Oh!  bethink thee,\" said the prince, in a voice of real and imploring anguish; \"bethink thee well of the consequences of thy refusal.  Thou canst not see them yet; thine ardour blinds thee.  But, when hour after hour, day after day, year after year, steals on in the appalling monotony of this sanctified prison; when thou shalt see thy youth--withering without love--thine age without honour; when thy heart shall grow as stone within thee, beneath the looks of you icy spectres; when nothing shall vary the aching dulness of wasted life save a longer fast or a severer penance: then, then will thy grief be rendered tenfold by the despairing and remorseful thought, that thine own lips sealed thine own sentence.  Thou mayest think,\" continued Juan, with rapid eagerness, \"that my love to thee was at first light and dishonouring.  Be it so.  I own that my youth has passed in idle wooings, and the mockeries of affection.  But for the first time in my life I feel that--I love.  Thy dark eyes--thy noble beauty--even thy womanly scorn, have fascinated me. I--never yet disdained where I have been a suitor--acknowledge, at last, that there is a triumph in the conquest of a woman's heart.  Oh, Leila! do not--do not reject me.  You know not how rare and how deep a love you cast away.\"  The novice was touched: the present language of Don Juan was so different from what it had been before; the earnest love that breathed in his voice--that looked from his eyes, struck a chord in her breast; it reminded her of her own unconquered, unconquerable love for the "]]]
