The master has his own again. The dear old times are coming back to us.\"  \"How the trees blow!\" exclaimed the child, looking up at the green arch overhead. \"See! They's all a-noddin' to each othah.\" \"We'll have to get my shoes an' 'tockin's,\" she said, presently, when they were nearly home. \"They're in that fence cawnah behin' a log.\"  The Colonel obediently got down and handed them to her. As he mounted again he saw a carriage coming toward them. He recognized one of his nearest neighbours. Striking the astonished Maggie Boy with his spur, he turned her across the railroad track, down the steep embankment, and into an unfrequented lane.  \"This road is just back of your garden,\" he said. \"Can you get through the fence if I take you there?\"  \"That's the way we came out,\" was the answer. \"See that hole where the palin's are off?\"  Just as he was about to lift her down, she put one arm around his neck, and kissed him softly on the cheek. \"Good-bye, gran'fatha',\" she said, in her most winning way. \"I've had a mighty nice time.\" Then she added, in a lower tone, \"'Kuse me fo' throwin' mud on yo' coat.\"  He held her close a moment, thinking nothing had ever before been half so sweet as the way she called him grandfather.  From that moment his heart went out to her as it had to little Tom and Elizabeth. It made no difference if her mother had forfeited his love. It made no difference if Jack Sherman was her father, and that the two men heartily hated each other.  It was his own little grandchild he held in his arms.  She had sealed the relationship with a trusting kiss.  \"Child,\" he said, huskily, \"you will come and see me again, won't you, no matter if they do tell you not to? You shall have all the flowers and berries you want, and you can ride Maggie Boy as often as you please.\"  She looked up into his face. It was very familiar to her. She had looked at his portrait often, unconsciously recognizing a kindred spirit that she longed to know.  Her ideas of grandfathers, gained from stories and observation, led her to class them with fairy godmothers. She had always wished for one.  The day they moved to Lloydsborough, Locust had been pointed out to her as her grandfather's home. From that time on she slipped away with Fritz on every possible occasion to peer through the gate, hoping for a glimpse of him.  \"Yes, I'll come suah!\" she promised. \"I likes you just lots, gran'fathah!\" He watched her scramble through the hole in the fence. Then he turned his horse's head slowly homeward.  A scrap of white lying on the grass attracted his attention as he neared the gate.  \"It's the lost sunbonnet,\" he said, with a smile. He carried it into the house, and hung it on the hat-rack in the wide front hall.  \"Ole marse is crosser'n two sticks,\" growled Walker to the cook at dinner. \"There ain't no livin' with him. What do you s'pose is the mattah?\"     CHAPTER IV.   Mom Beck was busy putting lunch on the table when the Little Colonel looked in at the kitchen door.  So she did not see a little tramp, carrying her shoes in one hand, and a basket in the other, who paused there a moment. But when she took up the pan of beaten biscuit she was puzzled to find that several were missing.  \"It beats my time,\" she said, aloud. \"The parrot couldn't have reached them, an' Lloyd an' the dog have been in the pa'lah all mawnin'. Somethin' has jus' natch'ly done sperrited 'em away.\"  Fritz was gravely licking his lips, and the Little Colonel had her mouth full, when they suddenly made their appearance on the front porch.  Aunt Sally Tyler gave a little shriek, and stopped rocking.  \"Why, Lloyd Sherman!\" gasped her mother, in dismay. \"Where have you been? I thought you were with Becky all the time. I was sure I heard you singing out there a little while ago.\"  \"I've been to see my gran'fathah,\" said the child, speaking very fast. \"I made mud pies on his front 'teps, an' we both of us got mad, an' I throwed mud on him, an' he gave me some 'trawberries an' all these flowers, an' brought me home on Maggie Boy.\"  She stopped out of breath. Mrs. Tyler and her niece exchanged astonished glances.  \"But, baby, how could you disgrace mother so by going up there looking like a dirty little beggar?\"  \"He didn't care,\" replied Lloyd, calmly. \"He made me promise to come again, no mattah if you all did tell me not to.\"  Just then Becky announced that lunch was ready, and carried the child away to make her presentable.  To Lloyd's great surprise she was not put to bed, but was allowed to go to the table as soon as she was dressed. It was not long until she had told every detail of the morning's experience.  While she was taking her afternoon nap, the two ladies sat out on the porch, gravely discussing all she had told them.  \"It doesn't seem right for me to allow her to go there,\" said Mrs. Sherman, \"after the way papa has treated us. I can never forgive him for all the terrible things he has said about Jack, and I know Jack can never be friends with him on account of what he has said about me. He has been so harsh and unjust that I don't want my little Lloyd to have anything to do with him. I wouldn't for worlds have him think that I encouraged her going there.\"  \"Well, yes, I know,\" answered her aunt, slowly. \"But there are some things to consider besides your pride, Elizabeth. There's the child herself, you know. Now that Jack has lost so much, and your prospects are so uncertain, you ought to think of her interests. It would be a pity for Locust to go to strangers when it has been in your family for so many generations. That's what it certainly will do unless something turns up to interfere. Old Judge Woodard told me himself that your father had made a will, leaving everything he owns to some medical institution. Imagine Locust being turned into a sanitarium or a training-school for nurses!\"  \"Dear old place!\" said Mrs. Sherman, with tears in her eyes. \"No one ever had a happier childhood than I passed under these old locusts. Every tree seems like a friend. I would be glad for Lloyd to enjoy the place as I did.\"  \"I'd let her go as much as she pleases, Elizabeth. She's so much like the old Colonel that they ought to understand each other, and get along capitally. Who knows, it might end in you all making up some day.\"  Mrs. Sherman raised her head haughtily. \"No, indeed, Aunt Sally. I can forgive and forget much, but you are greatly mistaken if you think I can go to such lengths as that. He closed his doors against me with a curse, for no reason on earth but that the man I loved was born north of the Mason and Dixon line. There never was a nobler man living than Jack, and papa would have seen it if he hadn't deliberately shut his eyes and refused to look at him. He was just prejudiced and stubborn.\"  Aunt Sally said nothing, but her thoughts took the shape of Mom Beck's declaration, \"The Lloyds is all stubborn.\"  \"I wouldn't go through his gate now if he got down on his knees and begged me,\" continued Elizabeth, hotly.  \"It's too bad,\" exclaimed her aunt; \"he was always so perfectly devoted to 'little daughter,' as he used to call you. I don't like him myself. We never could get along together at all, because he is so high-strung and overbearing. But I know it would have made your poor mother mighty unhappy if she could have foreseen all this.\"  Elizabeth sat with the tears dropping down on her little white hands, as her aunt proceeded to work on her sympathies in every way she could think of.  Presently Lloyd came out all fresh and rosy from her long nap, and went to play in the shade of the great beech-trees that guarded the cottage.  \"I never saw a child with such influence over animals,\" said her mother, as Lloyd came around the house with the parrot perched on the broom she was carrying. \"She'll walk right up to any strange dog and make friends with it, no matter how savage-looking it is. And there's Polly, so old and cross that she screams and scolds dreadfully if any of us go near her. But Lloyd dresses her up in doll's clothes, puts paper bonnets on her, and makes her just as uncomfortable as she pleases. Look! that is one of her favourite amusements.\"  The Little Colonel squeezed the parrot into a tiny doll carriage, and began to trundle it back and forth as fast as she could run.  \"Ha! ha!\" screamed the bird. \"Polly is a lady! Oh, Lordy! I'm so happy!\"  \"She caught that from the washerwoman,\" laughed Mrs. Sherman. \"I should think the poor thing would be dizzy from whirling around so fast.\"  \"Quit that, chillun; stop yo' fussin',\" screamed Polly, as Lloyd grabbed her up and began to pin a shawl around her neck. She clucked angrily, but never once attempted to snap at the dimpled fingers that squeezed her tight. Suddenly, as if her patience was completely exhausted, she uttered a disdainful \"Oh, pshaw!\" and flew up into an old cedar-tree.  \"Mothah! Polly won't play with me any moah,\" shrieked the child, flying into a rage. She stamped and scowled and grew red in the face. Then she began beating the trunk of the tree with the old broom she had been carrying.  \"Did you ever see anything so much like the old Colonel?\" said Mrs. Tyler, in astonishment. \"I wonder if she acted that way this morning.\"  \"I don't doubt it at all,\" answered Mrs. Sherman. \"She'll be over it in just a moment. These little spells never last long.\"  Mrs. Sherman was right. In a few moments Lloyd came up the walk, singing.  \"I wish you'd tell me a pink story,\" she said, coaxingly, as she leaned against her mother's knee.  \"Not now, dear; don't you see that I am busy talking to Aunt Sally?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9407"],["title","The Little Colonel (#4)"],["body","and ask Mom Beck for one.\"  \"What on earth does she mean by a pink story?\" asked Mrs. Tyler.  \"Oh, she is so fond of colours. She is always asking for a pink or a blue or a white story. She wants everything in the story tinged with whatever colour she chooses,--dresses, parasols, flowers, sky, even the icing on the cakes and the paper on the walls.\"  \"What an odd little thing she is!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tyler. \"Isn't she lots of company for you?\"  She need not have asked that question if she could have seen them that evening, sitting together in the early twilight.  Lloyd was in her mother's lap, leaning her head against her shoulder as they rocked slowly back and forth on the dark porch.  There was an occasional rattle of wheels along the road, a twitter of sleepy birds, a distant croaking of frogs.  Mom Beck's voice floated in from the kitchen, where she was stepping briskly around.    \"Oh, the clouds hang heavy, an' it's gwine to rain.   Fa'well, my dyin' friends,\"  she sang.  Lloyd put her arms closer around her mother's neck.  \"Let's talk about Papa Jack,\" she said. \"What you 'pose he's doin' now, 'way out West?\"  Elizabeth, feeling like a tired, homesick child herself, held her close, and was comforted as she listened to the sweet little voice talking about the absent father.  The moon came up after awhile, and streamed in through the vines of the porch. The hazel eyes slowly closed as Elizabeth began to hum an old-time negro lullaby.  \"Wondah if she'll run away to-morrow,\" whispered Mom Beck, as she came out to carry her in the house.  \"Who'd evah think now, lookin' at her pretty, innocent face, that she could be so naughty? Bless her little soul!\"  The kind old black face was laid lovingly a moment against the fair, soft cheek of the Little Colonel. Then she lifted her in her strong arms, and carried her gently away to bed.     CHAPTER V.   Summer lingers long among the Kentucky hills. Each passing day seemed fairer than the last to the Little Colonel, who had never before known anything of country life.  Roses climbed up and almost hid the small white cottage. Red birds sang in the woodbine. Squirrels chattered in the beeches. She was out-of-doors all day long.  Sometimes she spent hours watching the ants carry away the sugar she sprinkled for them. Sometimes she caught flies for an old spider that had his den under the porch steps. \"He is an ogah\" (ogre), she explained to Fritz. \"He's bewitched me so's I have to kill whole families of flies for him to eat.\"  She was always busy and always happy.  Before June was half over it got to be a common occurrence for Walker to ride up to the gate on the Colonel's horse. The excuse was always to have a passing word with Mom Beck. But before he rode away, the Little Colonel was generally mounted in front of him. It was not long before she felt almost as much at home at Locust as she did at the cottage.  The neighbours began to comment on it after awhile. \"He will surely make up with Elizabeth at this rate,\" they said. But at the end of the summer the father and daughter had not even had a passing glimpse of each other. One day, late in September, as the Little Colonel clattered up and down the hall with her grandfather's spur buckled on her tiny foot, she called back over her shoulder: \"Papa Jack's comin' home to-morrow.\"  The Colonel paid no attention.  \"I say,\" she repeated, \"Papa Jack's comin' home to-morrow.\"  \"Well,\" was the gruff response. \"Why couldn't he stay where he was? I suppose you won't want to come here any more after he gets back.\"  \"No, I 'pose not,\" she answered, so carelessly that he was conscious of a very jealous feeling.  \"Chilluns always like to stay with their fathahs when they's nice as my Papa Jack is.\"  The old man growled something behind his newspaper that she did not hear. He would have been glad to choke this man who had come between him and his only child, and he hated him worse than ever when he realized what a large place he held in Lloyd's little heart.  She did not go back to Locust the next day, nor for weeks after that.  She was up almost as soon as Mom Beck next morning, thoroughly enjoying the bustle of preparation.  She had a finger in everything, from polishing the silver to turning the ice-cream freezer.  Even Fritz was scrubbed till he came out of his bath with his curls all white and shining. He was proud of himself, from his silky bangs to the tip of his tasselled tail.  Just before train time, the Little Colonel stuck his collar full of late pink roses, and stood back to admire the effect. Her mother came to the door, dressed for the evening. She wore an airy-looking dress of the palest, softest blue. There was a white rosebud caught in her dark hair. A bright colour, as fresh as Lloyd's own, tinged her cheeks, and the glad light in her brown eyes made them unusually brilliant.  Lloyd jumped up and threw her arms about her. \"Oh, mothah,\" she cried, \"you an' Fritz is so bu'ful!\"  The engine whistled up the road at the crossing. \"Come, we have just time to get to the station,\" said Mrs. Sherman, holding out her hand.  They went through the gate, down the narrow path that ran beside the dusty road. The train had just stopped in front of the little station when they reached it.  A number of gentlemen, coming out from the city to spend Sunday at the hotel, came down the steps. They glanced admiringly from the beautiful, girlish face of the mother to the happy child dancing impatiently up and down at her side. They could not help smiling at Fritz as he frisked about in his imposing rose-collar.  \"Why, where's Papa Jack?\" asked Lloyd, in distress, as passenger after passenger stepped down. \"Isn't he goin' to come?\"  The tears were beginning to gather in her eyes, when she saw him in the door of the car; not hurrying along to meet them as he always used to come, so full of life and vigour, but leaning heavily on the porter's shoulder, looking very pale and weak.  Lloyd looked up at her mother, from whose face every particle of colour had faded. Mrs. Sherman gave a low, frightened cry as she sprang forward to meet him. \"Oh, Jack! what is the matter? What has happened to you?\" she exclaimed, as he took her in his arms. The train had gone on, and they were left alone on the platform.  \"Just a little sick spell,\" he answered, with a smile. \"We had a fire out at the mines, and I overtaxed myself some. I've had fever ever since, and it has pulled me down considerably.\"  \"I must send somebody for a carriage,\" she said, looking around anxiously.  \"No, indeed,\" he protested. \"It's only a few steps; I can walk it as well as not. The sight of you and the baby has made me stronger already.\"  He sent a coloured boy on ahead with his valise, and they walked slowly up the path, with Fritz running wildly around them, barking a glad welcome.  \"How sweet and homelike it all looks!\" he said, as he stepped into the hall, where Mom Beck was just lighting the lamps. Then he sank down on the couch, completely exhausted, and wearily closed his eyes.  The Little Colonel looked at his white face in alarm. All the gladness seemed to have been taken out of the homecoming.  Her mother was busy trying to make him comfortable, and paid no attention to the disconsolate little figure wandering about the house alone. Mom Beck had gone for the doctor.  The supper was drying up in the warming-oven. The ice-cream was melting in the freezer. Nobody seemed to care. There was no one to notice the pretty table with its array of flowers and cut glass and silver.  When Mom Beck came back, Lloyd ate all by herself, and then sat out on the kitchen door-step while the doctor made his visit.  She was just going mournfully off to bed with an aching lump in her throat, when her mother opened the door.  \"Come tell papa good-night,\" she said. \"He's lots better now.\"  She climbed up on the bed beside him, and buried her face on his shoulder to hide the tears she had been trying to keep back all evening.  \"How the child has grown!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you notice, Beth, how much plainer she talks? She does not seem at all like the baby I left last spring. Well, she'll soon be six years old,--a real little woman. She'll be papa's little comfort.\"  The ache in her throat was all gone after that. She romped with Fritz all the time she was undressing.  Papa Jack was worse next morning. It was hard for Lloyd to keep quiet when the late September sunshine was so gloriously yellow and the whole outdoors seemed so wide awake.  She tiptoed out of the darkened room where her father lay, and swung on the front gate until she saw the doctor riding up on his bay horse. It seemed to her that the day never would pass.  Mom Beck, rustling around in her best dress ready for church, that afternoon, took pity on the lonesome child.  \"Go get yo' best hat, honey,\" she said, \"an' I'll take you with me.\"  It was one of the Little Colonel's greatest pleasures to be allowed to go to the coloured church.  She loved to listen to the singing, and would sit perfectly motionless while the sweet voices blended like the chords of some mighty organ as they sent the old hymns rolling heavenward. Service had already commenced by the time they took their seats. Nearly everybody in the congregation was swaying back and forth in time to the mournful melody of \"Sinnah, sinnah, where's you boun'?\"  One old woman across the aisle began clapping her hands together, and repeated in a singsong tone, \"Oh, Lordy! I'm so happy!\"  \"Why, that's just what our parrot says,\" exclaimed Lloyd, so much surprised that she spoke right out loud.  Mom Beck put her handkerchief over her mouth, and a general smile went around.  After that the child was very quiet until the time came to take the collection. She always enjoyed this part of the service more than anything else. Instead of passing baskets around, each person was invited to come forward and lay his offering on the table.  Woolly heads wagged, and many feet kept time to the"]]]
