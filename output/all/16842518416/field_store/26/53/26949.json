Elsie loved her new mamma dearly and was as respectful and obedient to her as to her father, though Rose never assumed any authority; which, however, was entirely unnecessary, as a wish or request from her was sure to be attended to as if it had been a command.  And Rose was very happy in her new home. Mr. Dinsmore's family were pleased with the match and treated her most kindly, while he was always affectionate, thoughtful, and attentive; not less devoted as a husband than as a father. They were well suited in taste and disposition; seldom had the slightest disagreement on any subject, and neither had ever cause to regret the step they had taken, for each day they lived together seemed but to increase their love for each other, and for their little daughter, as Mr. Dinsmore delighted to call her, always giving Rose a share in the ownership.     CHAPTER IV.    Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth   What joy is welcomed like a new-born child?    --MRS. NORTON.   \"Massa wants you for to come right along to him in de study, darlin', jis as soon as your ole mammy kin get you dressed,\" said Chloe, one morning to her nursling.  \"What for, mammy?\" Elsie asked curiously, for she noticed an odd expression on her nurse's face.  \"Massa didn't tell me nuffin 'bout what he wanted, an' I spects you'll have to az hisself,\" replied Chloe evasively.  Elsie's curiosity was excited, and she hastened to the study as soon as possible. Her father laid down his paper as she entered, and held out his hand with a smile as he bade her good-morning, and it struck her that there was an odd twinkle in his eye also, while she was certain that she could not be mistaken in the unusually joyous expression of his countenance.  \"Good-morning, papa. But where is mamma?\" she asked, glancing about the room in search of her.  \"She is not up yet, but do you sit down here in your little rocking chair. I have something for you.\"  He left the room as he spoke, returning again in a moment, carrying what Elsie thought was a strange-looking bundle.  \"There! hold out your arms,\" he said; and placing it in them, he gently raised one corner of the blanket, displaying to her astonished view a tiny little face.  \"A baby! Oh, the dear little thing!\" she exclaimed in tones of rapturous delight. Then looking up into his face, \"Did you say I might have it, papa? whose baby is it?\"  \"Ours; your mamma's and my son, and your brother,\" he answered, gazing down with intense pleasure at her bright, happy face, sparkling all over with delight.  \"My little brother! my darling little brother,\" she murmured looking down at it again, and venturing to press her lips gently to its soft velvet cheek. \"Oh, papa, I am so glad, so glad! I have so wanted a little brother or sister. Is not God very good to give him to us, papa?\" And happy, grateful tears were trembling in the soft eyes as she raised them to his face again.  \"Yes,\" he said, bending down and kissing first her cheek, and then the babe's, \"I feel that God has indeed been very good to me in bestowing upon me two such treasures as these.\"  \"What is his name, papa?\" she asked.  \"He has none yet, my dear.\"  \"Then, papa, do let him be named Horace, for you; won't you if mamma is willing? And then I hope he will grow up to be just like you; as handsome and as good.\"  \"I should like him to be a great deal better, daughter,\" he answered with a grave smile; \"and about the name--I don't know yet; I should prefer some other, but your mamma seems to want that, and I suppose she has the best right to name him; but we will see about it.\"  \"Better give little marster to me now, Miss Elsie,\" remarked his nurse, stepping up, \"I reckon your little arms begin to feel tired.\" And taking the babe she carried him from the room.  Nothing could have better pleased Mr. Dinsmore than Elsie's joyous welcome to her little brother; though it was scarcely more than he had expected.  \"My own darling child; my dear, dear little daughter,\" he said, taking her in his arms and kissing her again and again. \"Elsie, dearest, you are very precious to your father's heart.\"  \"Yes, papa, I know it,\" she replied, twining her arms about his neck, and laying her cheek to his; \"I know you love me dearly, and it makes me so very happy.\"  \"May I go in to see mamma?\" she asked presently.  \"No, darling, not yet; she is not able to see you; but she sends her love, and hopes she may be well enough to receive a visit from you to-morrow.\"  \"Poor mamma! I am sorry she is ill,\" she said sorrowfully; \"but I will try to keep everything very quiet that she may not be disturbed.\"  That evening, after tea, Elsie was told that she would be allowed to speak to her mamma for a moment if she chose, and she gladly availed herself of the privilege.  \"Dear Elsie,\" Rose whispered, drawing Her down to kiss her cheek, \"I am so glad you are pleased with your little brother.\"  \"Oh, mamma, he is such a dear little fellow!\" Elsie answered eagerly; \"and now, if you will only get well we will be happier than ever.\"  Rose smiled and said she hoped soon to be quite well again, and then Mr. Dinsmore led Elsie from the room.  Rose was soon about again and in the enjoyment of her usual health and strength. Elsie's delight knew no bounds the first time her mamma was able to leave her room, and take her place at the table with her father and herself. She doted on her little brother, and, if allowed, would have had him in her arms more than half the time; but he was a plump little fellow, and soon grew so large and heavy that her father forbade her carrying him lest she should injure herself; but she would romp and play with him by the hour while he was in the nurse's arms, or seated on the bed; and when any of her little friends called, she could not be satisfied to let them go away without seeing the baby.  The first time Mr. Travilla called, after little Horace's arrival, she exhibited her treasure to him with a great deal of pride, asking if he did not envy her papa.  \"Yes,\" he said, looking admiringly at her, and then turning away with a half sigh.  A few minutes afterwards he caught hold of her, set her on his knee, and giving her a kiss, said, \"I wish you were ten years older, Elsie, or I ten years younger.\"  \"Why, Mr. Travilla?\" she asked rather wonderingly.  \"Oh, because we would then be nearer of an age, and maybe you would like me better.\"  \"No, I wouldn't, not a bit,\" she said, putting her arm round his neck, \"for I like you now just as well as I could like any gentleman but papa.\"  The elder Mr. Dinsmore was very proud of his little grandson and made a great pet of him, coming to the Oaks much more frequently after his birth than before.  Once he spoke of him as his first grandchild.  \"You forget Elsie, father,\" said Horace, putting his arm round his little girl, who happened to be standing by his side, and giving her a tender, loving look.  He greatly feared that the marked difference his father made between the two would wound Elsie's sensitive spirit, and perhaps even arouse a feeling of jealousy towards her little brother; therefore, when his father was present, he was even more than usually affectionate in his manner towards her, if that were possible.  But Elsie had no feeling of the kind; she had long ceased to expect any manifestation of affection from her grandfather towards herself, but was very glad indeed that he could love her dear little brother.  \"Ah, yes! to be sure, I did forget Elsie,\" replied the old gentleman carelessly; \"she is the first grandchild of course; but this fellow is the first grandson, and quite proud of him I am. He is a pretty boy, and is going to be the very image of his father.\"  \"I hope he will, father,\" said Rose, looking proudly at her husband. And then she added, with an affectionate glance at Elsie: \"If he is only as good and obedient as his sister, I shall be quite satisfied with him. We could not ask a better child than our dear little daughter, nor love one more than we do her; she is a great comfort and blessing to us both.\"  The color mounted to Elsie's cheek, and her eyes beamed with pleasure. Mr. Dinsmore, too, looked very much gratified, and the old gentleman could not fail to perceive that the difference he made between the children was quite distasteful to both parents.     CHAPTER V.    A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,   A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.    --BYRON.   Elsie was nearly twelve when her little brother was born. During the next three years she led a life of quiet happiness, unmarked by any striking event. There were no changes in the little family at the Oaks but such as time must bring to all. Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore perhaps looked a trifle older than when they married, Elsie was budding into womanhood as fair and sweet a flower as ever was seen, and the baby had grown into a healthy romping boy.  At Roselands, on the contrary, there had been many and important changes. Louise and Lora were both married; the former to a resident of another State, who had taken her to his distant home; the latter to Edward Howard, an older brother of Elsie's friend Carrie. They had not left the neighborhood, but were residing with his parents.  For the last two or three years Arthur Dinsmore had spent his vacations at home; he was doing so now, having just completed his freshman year at Princeton. On his return Walter was to accompany him and begin his college career.  Miss Day left soon after Lora's marriage and no effort had been made to fill her place, Adelaide having undertaken to act as governess to Enna, now the only remaining occupant of the school-room.  Taking advantage of an unusually cool breezy afternoon, Elsie rode over to Tinegrove, Mr. Howard's plantation--to make a call. She found the family at home and was urged to stay to tea; but declined, saying she could not without permission, and had not asked it.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],["title","Elsie's Girlhood (#7)"],["body","\"You will at least take off your hat,\" said Carrie.  \"No, thank you,\" Elsie answered, \"it is not worth while, as I must go so soon. If you will excuse me, I can talk quite as well with it on.\"  They had not met for several weeks and found a good deal to say to each other. At length Elsie drew out her watch.  \"Ah!\" she exclaimed, \"I have overstayed my time! I had no idea it was so late--you have been so entertaining; but I must go now.\" And she rose hastily to take leave.  \"Nonsense!\" said her Aunt Lora in whose boudoir they were sitting, \"there is no such great hurry, I am sure. You'll get home long before dark.\"  \"Yes, and might just as well stay another five or ten minutes. I wish you would; for I have ever so much to say to you,\" urged Carrie.  \"It would be very pleasant, thank you, but indeed I must not. See how the shadows are lengthening, and papa does not at all like to have me out after sunset unless he is with me.\"  \"He always was overcareful of you, erring on the right side, I suppose, if that be an allowable expression,\" laughed Lora, as she and Carrie followed Elsie to the door to see her mount her horse.  The adieus were quickly spoken and the young girl, just touching the whip to the sleek side of her pony, set off at a gallop, closely followed by her faithful attendant Jim.  Several miles of rather a lonely road lay between them and home, and no time was to be lost, if they would reach the Oaks while the sun was still above the horizon.  They were hardly more than half a mile from the entrance to the grounds, when Elsie caught sight of a well-known form slowly moving down the road a few paces ahead of them. It was Arthur, and she soon perceived that it was his intention to intercept her; he stopped, turning his face toward her, sprang forward as she came up, and seized her bridle.  \"Stay a moment, Elsie,\" he said, \"I want to speak to you.\"  \"Then come on to the Oaks, and let us talk there; please do, for I am in a hurry.\"  \"No, I prefer to say my say where I am. I'll not detain you long. You keep out of earshot, Jim. I want to borrow a little money, Elsie; a trifle of fifty dollars or so. Can you accommodate me?\"  \"Not without papa's knowledge, Arthur. So I hope you do not wish to conceal the matter from him.\"  \"I do. I see no reason why he should know all my private affairs. Can't you raise that much without applying to him? Isn't your allowance very large now?\"  \"Fifty dollars a month, Arthur, but subject to the same conditions as of old. I must account to papa for every cent.\"  \"Haven't you more than that in hand now?\"  \"Yes, but what do you want it for?\"  \"That's neither your business nor his; let me have it for two weeks, I'll pay it back then, and in the meantime he need know nothing about it.\"  \"I cannot; I never have any concealments from papa, and I must give in my account in less than a week.\"  \"Nonsense! You are and always were the most disobliging creature alive!\" returned Arthur with an oath.  \"Oh, Arthur, how can you say such wicked words,\" she said, recoiling from him with a shudder. \"And you quite misjudge me. I would be glad to do anything for you that is right. If you will let me tell papa your wish, and he gives consent, you shall have the money at once. Now please let me go. The sun has set and I shall be so late that papa will be anxious and much displeased.\"  \"Who cares if he is!\" he answered roughly, still retaining his hold upon her bridle, and compelling her to listen while he continued to urge his request; enforcing it with arguments and threats.  They were alike vain, she steadfastly refused to grant it except on the conditions she had named, and which he determinately rejected--and insisted being left free to pursue her homeward way.  He grew furious, and at length with a shocking oath released her bridle, but at the same instant struck her pony a severe blow upon his haunches, with a stout stick he held in his hand.  The terrified animal, smarting with the pain, started aside, reared and plunged in a way that would have unseated a less skilful rider, and had nearly thrown Elsie from the saddle: then darted off at the top of its speed; but fortunately turned in at the gate held open by Jim, who had ridden on ahead and dismounted for that purpose.  \"Whoa, you Glossy! whoa dere!\" he cried, springing to the head of the excited animal, and catching its bridle in his powerful grasp.  \"Just lead her for a little, Jim,\" said Elsie \"There, there! my poor pretty Glossy, be quiet now. It was too cruel to serve you so; but it shan't happen again if your mistress can help it,\" she added in a voice tremulous with sympathy and indignation, patting and stroking her pony caressingly as she spoke.  Jim obeyed, walking on at a brisk pace, leading Glossy with his right hand, and keeping the bridle of the other horse over his left arm.  \"I'll walk the rest of the way, Jim,\" said Elsie presently, \"just stop her and let me get down. There,\" springing lightly to the ground, \"you may lead them both to the stable now.\"  She hurried forward along the broad, gravelled winding carriage road that led to the house. The next turn brought her face to face with her father.  \"What, Elsie! alone and on foot at this late hour?\" he said in a tone of mingled surprise and reproof.  \"I have been riding, papa, and only a moment since dismounted and let Jim lead the horses down the other road to the stables.\"  \"Ah, but how did you come to be so late?\" he asked, drawing her hand within his arm and leading her onward.  \"I have been to Tinegrove, sir, and Aunt Lora, Carrie, and I found so much to say to each other, that the time slipped away before I knew it.\"  \"It must not happen again, Elsie.\"  \"I do not mean it shall, papa, and I am very sorry.\"  \"Then I excuse you this once, daughter; it is not often you give me occasion to reprove you.\"  \"Thank you, papa,\" she said with a grateful, loving look. \"Did you come out in search of me?\"  \"Yes, your mamma and I had begun to grow anxious lest some accident had befallen you. Our little daughter is such a precious treasure that we must needs watch over her very carefully,\" he added in a tone that was half playful, half tender, while he pressed the little gloved hand in his, and his eyes rested upon the sweet fair face with an expression of proud fatherly affection.  Her answering look was full of filial reverence and love. \"Dear papa, it is so nice to be so loved and cared for; so sweet to hear such words from your lips. I do believe I'm the very happiest girl in the land.\" She had already almost forgotten Arthur and his rudeness and brutality.  \"And I the happiest father,\" he said with a pleased smile. \"Ah, here comes mamma to meet as with little Horace.\"  The child ran forward with a glad shout to meet his sister, Rose met her with loving words and a fond caress; one might have thought from their joyous welcome, that she was returning after an absence of weeks or months instead of hours. Letting go her father's arm as they stepped upon the piazza Elsie began a romping play with her little brother, but at a gentle reminder from her mamma that the tea bell would soon ring, ran away to her own apartments to have her riding habit changed for something more suitable for the drawing room.  Chloe was in waiting and her skilful hands made rapid work, putting the last touches to her nursling's dress just as the summons to the supper table was given.  Mr. Dinsmore was quite as fastidious as in former days in regard to the neatness and tastefulness of Elsie's attire.  \"Will I do, papa?\" she asked, presenting herself before him, looking very sweet and fair in a simple white dress with blue sash and ribbons.  \"Yes,\" he said with a satisfied smile, \"I see nothing amiss with dress, hair, or face.\"  \"Nor do I,\" said Rose, leading the way to the supper room, \"Aunt Chloe is an accomplished tirewoman. But come, let us sit down to our meal and have it over.\"  On their return to the drawing room they, found Mr. Travilla comfortably ensconced in an easy chair, reading the evening paper. He was an almost daily visitor at the Oaks, and seldom came without some little gift for one or both of his friend's children. It was for Elsie to-night. When the usual greetings had been exchanged, he turned to her, saying, \"I have brought you a treat. Can you guess what it is?\"  \"A book!\"  \"Ah, there must be something of the Yankee about you,\" he answered, laughing. \"Yes, it is a book in two volumes; just published and a most delightful, charming story,\" he went on, drawing them from his pockets, and handing them to her as he spoke.  \"Oh, thank you, sir!\" she cried with eager gratitude, \"I'm so glad, if--if only papa will allow me to read it. May I, papa?\"  \"I can tell better when I have examined it, my child,\" Mr. Dinsmore answered, taking one of the volumes from her hands and looking at the title on the back. \"'The Wide, Wide World!' What sort of a book is it, Travilla?\"  \"A very good sort. I think. Just glance through it or read a few pages, and I'm pretty sure it will be sufficient to satisfy you of, not only its harmlessness, but that its perusal would be a benefit to almost any one.\"  Mr. Dinsmore did so, Elsie standing beside him, her hand upon his arm, and her eyes on his face--anxiously watching its changes of expression as he read. They grew more and more satisfactory; the book was evidently approving itself to his taste and judgment, and presently he returned it to her, saying, with a kind fatherly smile, \"Yes, my child, you may read it. I have no doubt it deserves all the praise Mr. Travilla has given it.\"  \"Oh, thank you, papa, I'm very glad,\" she answered joyously, \"I am just hungry for a nice story.\" And seating herself near the light, she was soon lost to everything about her in the deep interest with which she was following Ellen Montgomery through her troubles and trials.  She was loath to lay the book aside when at the usual hour--a quarter before nine--the bell rang for prayers."]]]
