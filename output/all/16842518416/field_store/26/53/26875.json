Some men were afraid that the new   art might do more harm than good. The king to whom the secret was told   thought that the children would be unwilling to work hard and try to   remember because everything could be written down and they would not   need to use their memories. The Egyptians at first used pictures to   put their words upon rocks or paper, and even after they made several   letters of the alphabet their writing seemed like a mixture of little   pictures and queer marks.    [Illustration: Cleopatra EGYPTIAN PHONETIC WRITING]  OLD AND NEW INVENTIONS. Those who first discover how to make things   are called inventors, and what they make are called inventions. Now if   we should write out a list of the most useful inventions, we could   place in one column the inventions which were made before the days of   Columbus and in another those which have been made since. With this   list before us we may ask which inventions we could live without and   which we could not spare unless we were willing to become like the   savages. We should find that a large number of the inventions which we   use every day belong to the set of things older than Columbus. This is   another reason why, if we wish to understand our ways of living and   working, we must ask about the history of the countries where our   forefathers lived. It is the beginning of our own history.    [Illustration: Phoenician Early Greek Early Latin English   GROWTH OF LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET]  A PLAN OF STUDY. The discovery of America was made in 1492, at the   beginning of what we call Modern Times. Before Modern Times were the   Middle Ages, lasting about a thousand years. These began three or four   hundred years after the time of Christ or what we call the beginning   of the Christian Era. All the events that took place earlier we say   happened in Ancient Times. Much that we know was learned first by the   Greeks or Romans who lived in Ancient Times.    It is in the Middle Ages that we first hear of peoples called   Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Dutchmen, Italians, Spaniards, and   many others now living in Great Britain and on the Continent of   Europe. We shall learn first of the Greeks and Romans and of what they   knew and succeeded in doing, and then shall find out how these things   were learned by the peoples of the Middle Ages and what they added to   them. This will help us to find out what our forefathers started with   when they came to live in America.       QUESTIONS      1. What does the emigrant from Europe bring to America besides his     baggage?      2. Why are all Americans emigrants?      3. What did the earliest emigrants from Europe to America bring with     them?      4. Which do you think the more useful invention--the telephone or     the art of writing? Who invented this art? Find Egypt on the map.     How did Egyptian writing look?      5. Why was it a help to Columbus that gunpowder and guns were     invented before he discovered America?      6. When did the Christian Era begin? What is meant by Ancient Times?     By the Middle Ages? By Modern Times? In what Times was the art of     writing invented? In what Times was the compass invented? In what     Times was the telephone invented?      EXERCISES      1. Collect from illustrated papers, magazines, or advertising     folders, pictures of ocean steamships. Collect pictures of sailing     ships, ships used now and those used long ago.      2. Collect from persons who have recently come to this country     stories of how they traveled from Europe to America, and from ports     like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to where they now live.      3. Let each boy and girl in the schoolroom point out on the map the     European country from which his parents or his grandparents or his     forefathers came.      4. Let each boy and girl make a list of the holidays which his     forefathers had in the \"fatherland\" or \"mother country.\" Let each     find out the manner in which the holidays were kept. Let each tell     the most interesting hero story from among the stories of the mother     country or fatherland. Let each find out whether the tools used in     the old home were like the tools his parents use here.     CHAPTER II   OUR EARLIEST TEACHERS  ANCIENT CITIES THAT STILL EXIST. In Ancient Times the most   important peoples lived on the shores of the Mediterranean. The   northern shore turns and twists around four peninsulas. The first is   Spain, which separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean;   the second, shaped like a boot, is Italy; and the third, the end of   which looks like a mulberry leaf, is Greece. Beyond Greece is Asia   Minor, the part of Asia which lies between the Mediterranean Sea and   the Black Sea.    The Italians now live in Italy, but the Romans lived there in Ancient   Times. The people who live in Greece are called Greeks, just as they   were more than two thousand years ago. Many of the cities that the   Greeks and Romans built are still standing. Alexandria was founded by   the great conqueror Alexander. Constantinople used to be the Greek   city of Byzantium. Another Greek city, Massilia, has become the modern   French city of Marseilles. Rome had the same name in Ancient Times,   except that it was spelled Roma. The Romans called Paris by the name   of Lutetia, and London they called Lugdunum.  RUINS WHICH SHOW HOW THE ANCIENTS LIVED. In many of these cities   are ancient buildings or ruins of buildings, bits of carving, vases,   mosaics, sometimes even wall paintings, which we may see and from   which we may learn how the Greeks and Romans lived. Near Naples are   the ruins of Pompeii, a Roman city suddenly destroyed during an   eruption of the volcano Vesuvius.    For hundreds of years the city lay buried under fifteen or twenty feet   of ashes. When these were taken away, the old streets and the walls of   the houses could be seen. No roofs were left and the walls in many   places were only partly standing, but things which in other ancient   cities had entirely disappeared were kept safe in Pompeii under the   volcanic ashes.    The traveler who walks to-day along the ruined streets can see how its   inhabitants lived two thousand years ago. He can visit their public   buildings and their private houses, can handle their dishes and can   look at the paintings on their walls or the mosaics in the floors. But   interesting as Pompeii is, we must not think that its ruins teach us   more than the ruins of Rome or Athens or many other ancient cities.   Each has something important to tell us of the people who lived long   ago.  ANCIENT WORDS STILL IN USE. The ancient Greeks and Romans have left   us some things more useful than the ruins of their buildings. These   are the words in our language which once were theirs, and which we use   with slight changes in spelling. Most of our words came in the   beginning from Germany, where our English forefathers lived before   they settled in England. To the words they took over from Germany they   added words borrowed from other peoples, just as we do now. We have   recently borrowed several words from the French, such as tonneau and   limousine, words used to describe parts of an automobile, besides the   name automobile itself, which is made up of a Latin and a Greek word.    [Illustration: RUINS OF A HOUSE AT POMPEII The houses of the   better sort were built with an open court in the center]    In this way, for hundreds of years, words have been coming into our   language from other languages. Several thousand have come from Latin,   the language of the Romans; several hundred from Greek, either   directly or passed on to us by the Romans or the French. The word   school is Greek, and the word arithmetic was borrowed from the French,   who took it from the Greeks. Geography is another word which came,   through French and Latin, from the Greeks, to whom it meant that which   is written about the earth. The word grammar came in the same way. The   word alphabet is made by joining together the names of the first two   Greek letters, alpha and beta.    Many words about religion are borrowed from the Greeks, and this is   not strange, for the New Testament was written in Greek. Some of these   are Bible, church, bishop, choir, angel, devil, apostle, and martyr.   The Greeks have handed down to us many words about government,   including the word itself, which in the beginning meant \"to steer.\"   Politics meant having to do with a _polis_ or city. Several of the   words most recently made up of Greek words are telegraph, telephone,   phonograph, and thermometer.  MANY WORDS BORROWED FROM THE ROMANS. Nearly ten times as many of   our words are borrowed from the Romans as from the Greeks, and it is   not strange, because at one time the Romans ruled over all the country   now occupied by the Italians, the French, the Spaniards, a part of the   Germans, and the English, so that these peoples naturally learned the   words used by their conquerors and governors.  INTERESTING ANCIENT STORIES. In the poems and tales which we learn   at home or at school are stories which Greek and Roman parents and   teachers taught their children many hundred years ago. We learn them   partly because they are interesting, and because they please or amuse   us, and partly because they appear so often in our books that it is   necessary to know them if we would understand our own books and   language. Who has not heard of Hercules and his Labors, of the Search   for the Golden Fleece, the Siege of Troy, or the Wanderings of   Ulysses? We love modern fairy stories and tales of adventure, but they   are not more pleasing than these ancient stories.    [Illustration: THE PLAIN OF MARATHON]  THE STORY OF THE GREEKS. Our language and our books are full of   memories of Greek and Roman deeds of courage. The story of the Greeks   comes before the story of the Romans, for the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],["title","Introductory American History (#2)"],["body","were living in   beautiful cities, with temples and theaters, while the Romans were   still an almost unknown people dwelling on the hills that border the   river Tiber.  MEMORIES OF GREEK COURAGE. The most heroic deeds of the Greeks took   place in a great war between the Greek cities and the kingdom of   Persia about five hundred years before Christ. In those days there was   no kingdom called Greece, such as the geographies now describe.   Instead there were cities, a few of which were ruled by kings, others   by the citizens themselves. These cities banded together when any   danger threatened them. Sometimes one city turned traitor and helped   the enemy against the others. The most dangerous enemy the Greeks had,   until the Romans attacked them, was the kingdom of Persia, which   stretched from the Aegean Sea far into Asia. In the war with the   Persians the Greeks fought three famous battles, at Marathon,   Thermopylae, and Salamis, the stories of which men have always liked   to hear and remember.  PREPARING FOR MARATHON, 490 B.C. To the Athenians belong the   glories of Marathon. They lived where the modern city of Athens now   stands. The ruins of their temples and theaters still attract students   and travelers to Greece. The plain of Marathon lay more than twenty   miles to the northeast, and the roads to it led through mountain   passes. When the Athenians heard that the hosts of the Great King of   Persia were approaching, they sent a runner, Pheidippides by name, to   ask aid of Sparta, a city one hundred and forty miles away, in the   peninsula now called the Morea, where dwelt the sturdiest fighters of   Greece. This runner reached Sparta on the second day, but the Spartans   said it would be against their religious custom to march before the   moon was full. The Athenians saw that they must meet the enemy   alone--one small city against a mighty empire. They called their ten   thousand men together and set out. On the way they were joined by a   thousand more, the whole army of the brave little town of Plataea.    [Illustration: GREEK SOLDIERS IN ARMS From a Greek vase of   about the time of the battle of Marathon]  HOW THE ATHENIANS WERE ARMED. Although the Persians had six times   as many soldiers as the Athenians, they were not so well armed for   hand to hand fighting. Their principal weapon was the bow and arrow,   while the Greeks used the lance and a short sword. The Greek soldier   was protected by his bronze helmet, solid across the forehead and over   the nose; by his breastplate, a leathern or linen tunic covered with   small metal scales, with flaps hanging below his hips; and by greaves   or pieces of metal in front of his knees and shins. He was also   protected by a shield, often long enough to reach from his face to his   knees. According to a strange custom the Athenians were led by ten   generals, each commanding one day in turn.  THE BATTLE-GROUND. Marathon was a plain about two miles wide, lying   between the mountains and the sea. From it two roads ran toward   Athens, one along the shore where the hills almost reached the sea,   the other up a narrow valley and over the mountains. The Athenians   were encamped in this valley, where they could attack the Persians if   they tried to follow the shore road.    The Persians landed from their ships and filled the plain near the   shore. They wanted to fight in the open plain because they had so many   more soldiers than the Athenians and because they meant to use their   horsemen. For some time the Athenians watched the Persians, not   knowing what it was best to do. Half the generals did not wish to risk   a battle, but Miltiades was eager to fight, for he feared that delay   would lead timid citizens or traitors to yield to the Persians. He   finally gained his wish, and on his day of command the battle was   ordered.  THE BATTLE. The Persians by this time had decided to sail around to   the harbor of Athens and had taken their horsemen on board their   ships. When they saw the Greeks coming they drew up their   foot-soldiers in deep masses. The Athenians and their comrades--the   Plataeans--soon began to move forward on the run. The Persians thought   this madness, because the Greeks had no archers or horsemen. But the   Greeks saw that if they moved forward slowly the Persians would have   time to shoot arrows at them again and again.    When the Greeks rushed upon the Persians the soldiers at the two ends   of the Persian line gave way and fled towards the shore. In the   center, where the best Persian soldiers stood, the Greeks were not at   first successful, and were forced to retreat. But those who had been   victorious came to their rescue, attacked the Persians in the rear,   and finally drove them off. The Persians ran into the sea to reach the   ships, and the Athenians followed them. Some of the Greeks were so   eager in the fight that they seized the sides of the ships and tried   to keep them from being rowed away, but the Persians cut at their   hands and made them let go.    [Illustration: THE STRAITS OF SALAMIS Where a great sea-fight   between Greeks and Persians took place]  THE NEWS OF THE VICTORY. The Athenians had won a victory of which   they were so proud that they meant it never should be forgotten. Their   city had suddenly become great through the courage and self-sacrifice   of her citizens. One hundred and ninety-two Greeks had fallen, and on   the battle-field their comrades raised over their bodies a mound of   earth which still marks their tomb. The victors sent the runner   Pheidippides to bear the news to Athens. Over the hills he ran until   he reached the market place, and there, with the message of triumph on   his lips, he fell dead.  OTHER VICTORIES OF THE GREEKS. Marathon was only the beginning of   Greek victories over the Persians, only the first struggle in the long   wars between Europe and Asia. Ten years after Marathon the Spartans   won everlasting glory by their heroic stand at the Pass of Thermopylae --three hundred Greeks against the mighty army of the Persian king   Xerxes. The barbarian hordes passed over their bodies, took the road   to Athens, burned the city, but were soon beaten in the sea-fight   which took place on the waters lying between the mainland of Athenian   territory and the island of Salamis. This victory was also due to   Athenian courage and leadership, for the Athenians and their leader,   Themistocles, were resolved to stay and fight, although the other   Greeks wanted to sail away.  WHY MARATHON IS REMEMBERED. The victories of Marathon and Salamis   were great not only because small armies of Greeks put to flight the   hosts of Persia, they were great because they saved the independence   of Greece. If the Greeks had become the subjects and slaves of Persia,   they would not have built the wonderful buildings, or carved the   beautiful statues, or written the books which we study and admire.   When we think of the Greeks as our first teachers we feel as proud of   their victories as if they were our own victories.  THE WARS OF THE GREEK CITIES. The Athenians had done the most in   winning the victory over the Persians, and therefore Athens was for   many years the most powerful city in Greece. The Spartans were always   jealous of the Athenians, and in less than a century after the victory   of Marathon they conquered and humbled Athens. The worst faults of the   Greeks were such jealousies and the desire to lord it over one   another. Greek history is full of wars of city against city, Sparta   against Athens, Corinth against Athens, and Thebes against Sparta. In   these wars many heroic deeds were done, of which we like to read, but   it is more important for us to understand how the Greeks lived.       QUESTIONS      1. What ancient cities still exist?

Find out how differently soldiers now are clothed and armed from     the way the Greek soldiers were.      4. Find out why a long distance run is now called a \"Marathon.\"     CHAPTER III   HOW THE GREEKS LIVED  THE GREEK CITIES. The Greeks lived in cities so much of the time that   we do not often think of them as ever living in the country. The   reason for this was that their government and everything else   important was carried on in the city. The cities were usually   surrounded by high, thick stone walls, which made them safe from   sudden attack. Within or beside the city there was often a lofty hill,   which we should call a fort or citadel, but which they called the   upper city or acropolis. There the people lived at first when they   were few in number, and thither they fled if the walls of their city   were broken down by enemies.    In Athens such a hill rose two hundred feet above the plain. Its top   was a thousand feet long, and all the sides except one were steep   cliffs. On it the Athenians built"]]]
