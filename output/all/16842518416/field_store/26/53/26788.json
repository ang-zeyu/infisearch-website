Why he's lingering on the pavement in front of this hotel I can't explain, but I'm certain he isn't touting. Probably he's waiting for a friend.\"  \"He's the best looking Arab we've seen yet,\" remarked Mrs. East. \"Like my idea of an Egyptian gentleman.\"  \"Pooh!\" said Monny. \"Just test him, Lord Ernest.\"  \"Sorry, but I can't do it,\" I answered, with a firmness which ought to have been tried on her long ago. \"And I wouldn't discuss him in such a loud tone of voice. He may understand English.\"  \"We have to yell to hear ourselves speak over all this row,\" Biddy apologized for her darling; but she need not have troubled herself. Miss Gilder had been deaf to my implied reproach.  \"I'm glad I'm an American girl,\" she said. \"When I want things I want them so dreadfully I just go for them, and surprise them so much that I get them before they know where they are. Now I'm going for this dragoman.\"  \"He's not a drag--\" I persisted, but she cut me short.  \"I bet you my hat he will be one! What will you bet that he won't, Lord Ernest?\"  \"I'll bet you his green turban,\" said I.  \"How can you get it?\"  \"As easily as you can get him,\" I retorted. \"It's a safe bet.\"  Monny looked excited, but firm. Luckily, as she does it so often, it's becoming to her to look firm. (I have noticed that it's not becoming to most girls. It squares their jaws and makes their eyes snap.) But the spoiled daughter of the dead Cannon King at her worst, merely looks pathetically earnest and Minerva-like. This, I suppose, is one of the \"little ways\" she has acquired, since she gave up kicking and screaming people into submission. As Biddy says, the girl can be charming not only when she wants to be, but quite often when she doesn't.  The man with the green turban was no longer engaged in hypnotizing. He had retired within himself, and appeared oblivious to the outer world. Yet nobody jostled the tall, straight figure which stood with folded arms, lightly leaning against a tree. The colour of his turban was sacred in the eyes of the crowd; and when Miss Gilder, leaning over the terrace railing beckoned him, surprise rather than jealousy showed on the faces of the unwanted dragomans. As for the wearer of the turban, he did what I expected and wished him to do: paid not the slightest attention to the gesture. Whatever the motive for his masquerade, it was not to attract anything feminine.  I smiled sardonically. \"That's a nice hat you've got on, Miss Gilder,\" I remarked.  \"Do you collect girls' hats?\" she asked sweetly. \"But mine isn't eligible yet for your collection. Let me see, what did you say he was? Oh, a Hadji!\" And she shrilled forth sweetly, her voice sounding young and clear, \"Hadji! Hadji! Effendi! Venez ici, s'il vous plait. Please come here.\"  I could have been knocked flat by a blow of the smallest, cheapest ostrich feather in the hands of any street-merchant. For he came. Anthony came! Not to look meekly up from the pavement below the railing, but to ascend the steps of the terrace, and advance with grave dignity toward our table. Within a yard of us he stopped, giving to me, not to Miss Gilder, the beautiful Arab salute, a touch on forehead and heart.  \"You devil!\" I was saying to myself. \"So you walk into this trap, do you, and calmly trust me to get you out. Serve you right if I don't move hand or foot.\" And I almost made up my mind that I wouldn't. But I was interested. I wanted intensely to know what the dickens Anthony was up to, and whether he would have been up to it if he'd known the sort of young woman he had to deal with.  \"It was I who called to you, not this gentleman,\" said Monny, when she found that Green Turban did not look at her. \"Do you speak French or English a little?\"  \"A little of both. But I choose French when talking to Americans,\" replied Anthony Fenton, with astounding impertinence, in the preferred language. \"I do not know you, Madame. But I do know this gentleman.\"  Good heavens! What next? He acknowledged me! What was I to do now? What did the impudent fellow want me to do? Evidently he was trying an experiment. Anthony is great on experiments, and always has been. But this was a bomb. I thought he wanted to see if I could catch it on the fly, and drop it into water before it had time to explode.  \"Why didn't you tell us, Lord Ernest?\" asked Monny, with a flash in her gray eyes. \"I thought you hadn't been in Egypt since you were a child.\"  \"I haven't, and I didn't recognize him at first,\" I answered, trying for the coolness which Anthony dared to count upon.  \"You remember me now?\" he inquired politely.  \"I--er--yes,\" I replied, also in French. \"Your face is familiar, though you've changed, I think, since--er--since you were in England. It must have been there--yes, of course. You were on a diplomatic mission. But your name--\"  \"You may have known me as Ahmed Antoun,\" said the wretch, not dreaming of that slip he had made.  Cleopatra, who has little French, nevertheless started, and fixed upon the face under the turban a stare of feverish interest. Brigit and the unobtrusive lady with the slanting eyes both showed such symptoms of surprise as must too late have warned Fenton that he had missed his footing, skating on thin ice.  \"Antoun!\" exclaimed Mrs. East. \"Why, that's what you said you called your friend Captain Fenton.\"  I glanced at Anthony. His profile had no more expression than that of an Indian on an American penny, and, indeed, rather resembled it. If he were blaming me for letting anything out, I had a right to blame him for letting himself in. He was silent as well as expressionless. He left it all to me--diplomat or duffer.  \"'Antoun Effendi' was the nickname my friend Fenton got at school,\" I explained to Cleopatra, \"because it sounded a bit like his own name, and because he had--er--because he had associations with Egypt. He was proud of them and is still. But Antoun is a name often heard here. And every man who isn't a Bey or a Prince, or a Sheikh, is an Effendi. I quite remember you now,\" I hurried on, turning to Anthony once more. \"You are Hadji as well as Effendi.\"  \"I have the right to call myself so, if I choose,\" he admitted. \"I am pleased to meet you again. I was waiting for a friend when you beckoned. If you did not recognize my face at first, may I ask what it was you wanted of me?\"  There was no limit, then, to his audacity. He had not learned his lesson yet, after all, it would seem.  Monny could not bear tamely to lose her hat, though she must have felt her hatpins trembling in the balance. \"I told you before,\" she repeated, \"that it was I who beckoned you.\" He looked at her, without speaking; and somehow the green turban and the long straight gown, by adding to his dignity, added also to his remote air of cold politeness. How could she go on? Had she the cheek to go on? She had; but the cheek was flushed with embarrassment.  \"I--er--I am anxious for a guide, some one who knows Egypt well, and several languages,\" she desperately blurted out, looking like a half-frightened, half-defiant child. \"I thought----\"  \"There are plenty of dragomans, Madame,\" Green Turban reminded her. \"I can recommend you several.\"  \"I don't want a regular dragoman,\" she said. \"And I'm not 'Madame.' I am Miss Gilder.\"  \"Indeed?\" Chilling indifference in the tone. (Monny's hat was practically mine. I thought I should rather value it.)  \"Yes. But of course that can't matter to you.\"  \"No. It cannot, Mademoiselle.\"  \"What I want to say, is this. You're a Hadji, which means you've been to Mecca; Lord Ernest Borrow's just told us. So you must be very intelligent. Are you in business?\"  \"I am interested in excavations.\"  \"Oh! And are you allowed to make them yourself?\"  \"Not always.\"  I glanced at him quickly, wondering if he meant that answer more for me than for the girl. But his face told nothing.  \"Would you be able to, if you were rich enough?\"  \"It is possible.\" \"Well, I'd be willing to give you a big salary for showing us about Cairo, and perhaps going up the Nile.\"  \"You do not know who I am, Mademoiselle. Ask your friend Lord Ernest Borrow. Perhaps he may remember something about my circumstances now he has recalled my face.\"  I was honestly not sure whether this were further deviltry, or an appeal for help. In any case, I thought it time for the scene to end. \"I told you,\" I said to Monny in English, \"that he was a man of importance, not at all the sort of person you could expect to engage for a guide. You must see now that he's a gentleman. And a--a--an Egyptian gentleman is just the same as any other.\"  \"Surely not quite!\" she answered in the same language, and I realized my foolish mistake in using it, as if I meant her to understand that Antoun Effendi knew it too little to catch our secrets.  \"An Egyptian man can't have the same feelings as a European? Why, for hundreds and hundreds of years they've been an enslaved race, like our black people at home. We'd never think of calling even the fairest quadroon man a gentleman, though he might be wonderfully good looking and nice mannered.\"  Literally, I was frightened. Anthony Fenton is fiercely devoted to the memory of the beautiful princess-mother, for love of whom his father's career was ruined. _Her_ mother was a Sicilian woman, and her father was half Greek, so there is little enough Egyptian blood, after all, in the veins of General Fenton's son. He is proud of what there is--proud, because of his mother's fatal charm, and the romance of her story (it was on the eve of her wedding with a cousin of the Sultan that the famous soldier Charles Fenton ran away with Princess Lalla and married her in Sicily): but he is sensitive, too, because, great name as Charles Fenton had made in Egypt, he was asked to resign his commission on account of the escapade.

The Period   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.  There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.  It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.  France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.  In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.     CHAPTER II. The Mail   It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.  With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.  There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.  Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many"]]]
