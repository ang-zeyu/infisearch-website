So now Rinkitink, with a serious look on his fat, red face, took off his purple robe and rolled up the sleeves of his tunic and tried again.  However, he succeeded no better than before and when he heard Bilbil give a gruff laugh and saw a smile upon the boy Prince's face, Rinkitink suddenly dropped the oars and began shouting with laughter at his own defeat. As he wiped his brow with a yellow silk handkerchief he sang in a merry voice:    \"A sailor bold am I, I hold,   But boldness will not row a boat.   So I confess I'm in distress   And just as useless as the goat.\"   \"Please leave me out of your verses,\" said Bilbil with a snort of anger.  \"When I make a fool of myself, Bilbil, I'm a goat,\" replied Rinkitink.  \"Not so,\" insisted Bilbil. \"Nothing could make you a member of my superior race.\"  \"Superior? Why, Bilbil, a goat is but a beast, while I am a King!\"  \"I claim that superiority lies in intelligence,\" said the goat.  Rinkitink paid no attention to this remark, but turning to Inga he said:  \"We may as well get back to the shore, for the boat is too heavy to row to Gilgad or anywhere else. Indeed, it will be hard for us to reach land again.\"  \"Let me take the oars,\" suggested Inga. \"You must not forget our bargain.\"  \"No, indeed,\" answered Rinkitink. \"If you can row us to Regos, or to any other place, I will go with you without protest.\"  So the King took Inga's place at the stern of the boat and the boy grasped the oars and commenced to row. And now, to the great wonder of Rinkitink--and even to Inga's surprise--the oars became light as feathers as soon as the Prince took hold of them. In an instant the boat began to glide rapidly through the water and, seeing this, the boy turned its prow toward the north. He did not know exactly where Regos and Coregos were located, but he did know that the islands lay to the north of Pingaree, so he decided to trust to luck and the guidance of the pearls to carry him to them.  Gradually the Island of Pingaree became smaller to their view as the boat sped onward, until at the end of an hour they had lost sight of it altogether and were wholly surrounded by the purple waters of the Nonestic Ocean.  Prince Inga did not tire from the labor of rowing; indeed, it seemed to him no labor at all. Once he stopped long enough to place the poles of the canopy in the holes that had been made for them, in the edges of the boat, and to spread the canopy of silver over the poles, for Rinkitink had complained of the sun's heat. But the canopy shut out the hot rays and rendered the interior of the boat cool and pleasant.  \"This is a glorious ride!\" cried Rinkitink, as he lay back in the shade. \"I find it a decided relief to be away from that dismal island of Pingaree.  \"It may be a relief for a short time,\" said Bilbil, \"but you are going to the land of your enemies, who will probably stick your fat body full of spears and arrows.\"  \"Oh, I hope not!\" exclaimed Inga, distressed at the thought.  \"Never mind,\" said the King calmly, \"a man can die but once, you know, and when the enemy kills me I shall beg him to kill Bilbil, also, that we may remain together in death as in life.\"  \"They may be cannibals, in which case they will roast and eat us,\" suggested Bilbil, who wished to terrify his master.  \"Who knows?\" answered Rinkitink, with a shudder. \"But cheer up, Bilbil; they may not kill us after all, or even capture us; so let us not borrow trouble. Do not look so cross, my sprightly quadruped, and I will sing to amuse you.\"  \"Your song would make me more cross than ever,\" grumbled the goat.  \"Quite impossible, dear Bilbil. You couldn't be more surly if you tried. So here is a famous song for you.\"  While the boy rowed steadily on and the boat rushed fast over the water, the jolly King, who never could be sad or serious for many minutes at a time, lay back on his embroidered cushions and sang as follows:    \"A merry maiden went to sea--   Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do!   She sat upon the Captain's knee   And looked around the sea to see   What she could see, but she couldn't see me--   Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do!   \"How do you like that, Bilbil?\"  \"I don't like it,\" complained the goat. \"It reminds me of the alligator that tried to whistle.\"  \"Did he succeed, Bilbil?\" asked the King.  \"He whistled as well as you sing.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha, ha, heek, keek, eek!\" chuckled the King. \"He must have whistled most exquisitely, eh, my friend?\"  \"I am not your friend,\" returned the goat, wagging his ears in a surly manner.  \"I am yours, however,\" was the King's cheery reply; \"and to prove it I'll sing you another verse.\"  \"Don't, I beg of you!\"  But the King sang as follows:    \"The wind blew off the maiden's shoe--     Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do!   And the shoe flew high to the sky so blue   And the maiden knew 'twas a new shoe, too;   But she couldn't pursue the shoe, 'tis true--     Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do!   \"Isn't that sweet, my pretty goat?\"  \"Sweet, do you ask?\" retorted Bilbil. \"I consider it as sweet as candy made from mustard and vinegar.\"  \"But not as sweet as your disposition, I admit. Ah, Bilbil, your temper would put honey itself to shame.\"  \"Do not quarrel, I beg of you,\" pleaded Inga. \"Are we not sad enough already?\"  \"But this is a jolly quarrel,\" said the King, \"and it is the way Bilbil and I often amuse ourselves. Listen, now, to the last verse of all:    \"The maid who shied her shoe now cried--     Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do!   Her tears were fried for the Captain's bride   Who ate with pride her sobs, beside,   And gently sighed 'I'm satisfied'--     Sing to-ral-oo-ral-i-do!\"   \"Worse and worse!\" grumbled Bilbil, with much scorn. \"I am glad that is the last verse, for another of the same kind might cause me to faint.\"  \"I fear you have no ear for music,\" said the King.  \"I have heard no music, as yet,\" declared the goat. \"You must have a strong imagination, King Rinkitink, if you consider your songs music. Do you remember the story of the bear that hired out for a nursemaid?\"  \"I do not recall it just now,\" said Rinkitink, with a wink at Inga.  \"Well, the bear tried to sing a lullaby to put the baby to sleep.\"  \"And then?\" said the King.  \"The bear was highly pleased with its own voice, but the baby was nearly frightened to death.\"  \"Heh, heb, heh, heh, whoo, hoo, hoo! You are a merry rogue, Bilbil,\" laughed the King; \"a merry rogue in spite of your gloomy features. However, if I have not amused you, I have at least pleased myself, for I am exceedingly fond of a good song. So let us say no more about it.\"  All this time the boy Prince was rowing the boat. He was not in the least tired, for the oars he held seemed to move of their own accord. He paid little heed to the conversation of Rinkitink and the goat, but busied his thoughts with plans of what he should do when he reached the islands of Regos and Coregos and confronted his enemies. When the others finally became silent, Inga inquired.  \"Can you fight, King Rinkitink?\"  \"I have never tried,\" was the answer. \"In time of danger I have found it much easier to run away than to face the foe.\"  \"But could you fight?\" asked the boy.  \"I might try, if there was no chance to escape by running. Have you a proper weapon for me to fight with?\"  \"I have no weapon at all,\" confessed Inga.  \"Then let us use argument and persuasion instead of fighting. For instance, if we could persuade the warriors of Regos to lie down, and let me step on them, they would be crushed with ease.\"  Prince Inga had expected little support from the King, so he was not discouraged by this answer. After all, he reflected, a conquest by battle would be out of the question, yet the White Pearl would not have advised him to go to Regos and Coregos had the mission been a hopeless one. It seemed to him, on further reflection, that he must rely upon circumstances to determine his actions when he reached the islands of the barbarians.  By this time Inga felt perfect confidence in the Magic Pearls. It was the White Pearl that had given him the boat, and the Blue Pearl that had given him strength to row it. He believed that the Pink Pearl would protect him from any danger that might arise; so his anxiety was not for himself, but for his companions. King Rinkitink and the goat had no magic to protect them, so Inga resolved to do all in his power to keep them from harm.  For three days and three nights the boat with the silver lining sped swiftly over the ocean. On the morning of the fourth day, so quickly had they traveled, Inga saw before him the shores of the two great islands of Regos and Coregos.  \"The pearls have guided me aright!\" he whispered to himself. \"Now, if I am wise, and cautious, and brave, I believe I shall be able to rescue my father and mother and my people.\"     Chapter Seven  The Twin Islands   The Island of Regos was ten miles wide and forty miles long and it was ruled by a big and powerful King named Gos. Near to the shores were green and fertile fields, but farther back from the sea were rugged hills and mountains, so rocky that nothing would grow there. But in these mountains were mines of gold and silver, which the slaves of the King were forced to work, being confined in dark underground passages for that purpose. In the course of time huge caverns had been hollowed out by the slaves, in which they lived and slept, never seeing the light of day. Cruel overseers with whips stood over these poor people, who had been captured in many countries by the raiding parties of King Cos, and the overseers were quite willing to lash the slaves with their whips if they faltered a moment in their work.  Between the green shores and the mountains were forests of thick, tangled trees, between which narrow paths had been cut to lead up to the caves of the mines. It was on the level green meadows, not far from the ocean, that the great City of Regos had been built, wherein was located the palace of the King. This city was inhabited by thousands of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9580"],["title","Anti-Slavery Poems and Songs of Labor and Reform, Complete (#0)"],["body","WORKS OF JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER,  Volume III.

TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE.  Toussaint L'Ouverture, the black chieftain of Hayti, was a slave on the plantation \"de Libertas,\" belonging to M. Bayou. When the rising of the negroes took place, in 1791, Toussaint refused to join them until he had aided M. Bayou and his family to escape to Baltimore. The white man had discovered in Toussaint many noble qualities, and had instructed him in some of the first branches of education; and the preservation of his life was owing to the negro's gratitude for this kindness.  In 1797, Toussaint L'Ouverture was appointed, by the French government, General-in-Chief of the armies of St. Domingo, and, as such, signed the Convention with General Maitland for the evacuation of the island by the British. From this period, until 1801, the island, under the government of Toussaint, was happy, tranquil, and prosperous.  The miserable attempt of Napoleon to re-establish slavery in St. Domingo, although it failed of its intended object, proved fatal to the negro chieftain. Treacherously seized by Leclerc, he was hurried on board a vessel by night, and conveyed to France, where he was confined in a cold subterranean dungeon, at Besancon, where, in April, 1803, he died. The treatment of Toussaint finds a parallel only in the murder of the Duke D'Enghien. It was the remark of Godwin, in his Lectures, that the West India Islands, since their first discovery by Columbus, could not boast of a single name which deserves comparison with that of Toussaint L'Ouverture.       'T WAS night. The tranquil moonlight smile      With which Heaven dreams of Earth, shed down      Its beauty on the Indian isle,--      On broad green field and white-walled town;      And inland waste of rock and wood,      In searching sunshine, wild and rude,      Rose, mellowed through the silver gleam,      Soft as the landscape of a dream.      All motionless and dewy wet,      Tree, vine, and flower in shadow met      The myrtle with its snowy bloom,      Crossing the nightshade's solemn gloom,--      The white cecropia's silver rind      Relieved by deeper green behind,      The orange with its fruit of gold,      The lithe paullinia's verdant fold,      The passion-flower, with symbol holy,      Twining its tendrils long and lowly,      The rhexias dark, and cassia tall,      And proudly rising over all,      The kingly palm's imperial stem,      Crowned with its leafy diadem,      Star-like, beneath whose sombre shade,      The fiery-winged cucullo played!       How lovely was thine aspect, then,      Fair island of the Western Sea      Lavish of beauty, even when      Thy brutes were happier than thy men,      For they, at least, were free!      Regardless of thy glorious clime,      Unmindful of thy soil of flowers,      The toiling negro sighed, that Time      No faster sped his hours.      For, by the dewy moonlight still,      He fed the weary-turning mill,      Or bent him in the chill morass,      To pluck the long and tangled grass,      And hear above his scar-worn back      The heavy slave-whip's frequent crack      While in his heart one evil thought      In solitary madness wrought,      One baleful fire surviving still      The quenching of the immortal mind,      One sterner passion of his kind,      Which even fetters could not kill,      The savage hope, to deal, erelong,      A vengeance bitterer than his wrong!       Hark to that cry! long, loud, and shrill,      From field and forest, rock and hill,      Thrilling and horrible it rang,      Around, beneath, above;      The wild beast from his cavern sprang,      The wild bird from her grove!      Nor fear, nor joy, nor agony      Were mingled in that midnight cry;      But like the lion's growl of wrath,      When falls that hunter in his path      Whose barbed arrow, deeply set,      Is rankling in his bosom yet,      It told of hate, full, deep, and strong,      Of vengeance kindling out of wrong;      It was as if the crimes of years--      The unrequited toil, the tears,      The shame and hate, which liken well      Earth's garden to the nether hell--      Had found in nature's self a tongue,      On which the gathered horror hung;      As if from cliff, and stream, and glen      Burst on the' startled ears of men      That voice which rises unto God,      Solemn and stern,--the cry of blood!      It ceased, and all was"]]]
