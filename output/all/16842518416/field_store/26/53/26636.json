But a fair field, where mind may close with mind,      Free as the sunshine and the chainless wind;      Where the high trust is fixed on Truth alone,      And bonds and fetters from the soul are thrown;      Where wealth, and rank, and worldly pomp, and might,      Yield to the presence of the True and Right.       And fitting is it that this Hall should stand      Where Pennsylvania's Founder led his band,      From thy blue waters, Delaware!--to press      The virgin verdure of the wilderness.      Here, where all Europe with amazement saw      The soul's high freedom trammelled by no law;      Here, where the fierce and warlike forest-men      Gathered, in peace, around the home of Penn,      Awed by the weapons Love alone had given      Drawn from the holy armory of Heaven;      Where Nature's voice against the bondman's wrong      First found an earnest and indignant tongue;      Where Lay's bold message to the proud was borne;      And Keith's rebuke, and Franklin's manly scorn!      Fitting it is that here, where Freedom first      From her fair feet shook off the Old World's dust,      Spread her white pinions to our Western blast,      And her free tresses to our sunshine cast,      One Hall should rise redeemed from Slavery's ban,      One Temple sacred to the Rights of Man!       Oh! if the spirits of the parted come,      Visiting angels, to their olden home      If the dead fathers of the land look forth      From their fair dwellings, to the things of earth,      Is it a dream, that with their eyes of love,      They gaze now on us from the bowers above?      Lay's ardent soul, and Benezet the mild,      Steadfast in faith, yet gentle as a child,      Meek-hearted Woolman, and that brother-band,      The sorrowing exiles from their \"Father land,\"      Leaving their homes in Krieshiem's bowers of vine,      And the blue beauty of their glorious Rhine,      To seek amidst our solemn depths of wood      Freedom from man, and holy peace with God;      Who first of all their testimonial gave      Against the oppressor, for the outcast slave,      Is it a dream that such as these look down,      And with their blessing our rejoicings crown?      Let us rejoice, that while the pulpit's door      Is barred against the pleaders for the poor;      While the Church, wrangling upon points of faith,      Forgets her bondmen suffering unto death;      While crafty Traffic and the lust of Gain      Unite to forge Oppression's triple chain,      One door is open, and one Temple free,      As a resting-place for hunted Liberty!      Where men may speak, unshackled and unawed,      High words of Truth, for Freedom and for God.      And when that truth its perfect work hath done,      And rich with blessings o'er our land hath gone;      When not a slave beneath his yoke shall pine,      From broad Potomac to the far Sabine      When unto angel lips at last is given      The silver trump of Jubilee in Heaven;      And from Virginia's plains, Kentucky's shades,      And through the dim Floridian everglades,      Rises, to meet that angel-trumpet's sound,      The voice of millions from their chains unbound;      Then, though this Hall be crumbling in decay,      Its strong walls blending with the common clay,      Yet, round the ruins of its strength shall stand      The best and noblest of a ransomed land--      Pilgrims, like these who throng around the shrine      Of Mecca, or of holy Palestine!      A prouder glory shall that ruin own      Than that which lingers round the Parthenon.      Here shall the child of after years be taught      The works of Freedom which his fathers wrought;      Told of the trials of the present hour,      Our weary strife with prejudice and power;      How the high errand quickened woman's soul,      And touched her lip as with a living coal;      How Freedom's martyrs kept their lofty faith      True and unwavering, unto bonds and death;      The pencil's art shall sketch the ruined Hall,      The Muses' garland crown its aged wall,      And History's pen for after times record      Its consecration unto Freedom's God!     THE NEW YEAR.  Addressed to the Patrons of the Pennsylvania Freeman.       THE wave is breaking on the shore,      The echo fading from the chime      Again the shadow moveth o'er      The dial-plate of time!       O seer-seen Angel! waiting now      With weary feet on sea and shore,      Impatient for the last dread vow      That time shall be no more!       Once more across thy sleepless eye      The semblance of a smile has passed:      The year departing leaves more nigh      Time's fearfullest and last.       Oh, in that dying year hath been      The sum of all since time began;      The birth and death, the joy and pain,      Of Nature and of Man.       Spring, with her change of sun and shower,      And streams released from Winter's chain,      And bursting bud, and opening flower,      And greenly growing grain;       And Summer's shade, and sunshine warm,      And rainbows o'er her hill-tops bowed,      And voices in her rising storm;      God speaking from His cloud!       And Autumn's fruits and clustering sheaves,      And soft, warm days of golden light,      The glory of her forest leaves,      And harvest-moon at night;       And Winter with her leafless grove,      And prisoned stream, and drifting snow,      The brilliance of her heaven above      And of her earth below;       And man, in whom an angel's mind      With earth's low instincts finds abode,      The highest of the links which bind      Brute nature to her God;       His infant eye bath seen the light,      His childhood's merriest laughter rung,      And active sports to manlier might      The nerves of boyhood strung!       And quiet love, and passion's fires,      Have soothed or burned in manhood's breast,      And lofty aims and low desires      By turns disturbed his rest.       The wailing of the newly-born      Has mingled with the funeral knell;      And o'er the dying's ear has gone      The merry marriage-bell.       And Wealth has filled his halls with mirth,      While Want, in many a humble shed,      Toiled, shivering by her cheerless hearth,      The live-long night for bread.       And worse than all, the human slave,      The sport of lust, and pride, and scorn!      Plucked off the crown his Maker gave,      His regal manhood gone!       Oh, still, my country! o'er thy plains,      Blackened with slavery's blight and ban,      That human chattel drags his chains,      An uncreated man!       And still, where'er to sun and breeze,      My country, is thy flag unrolled,      With scorn, the gazing stranger sees      A stain on every fold.       Oh, tear the gorgeous emblem down!      It gathers scorn from every eye,      And despots smile and good men frown      Whene'er it passes by.       Shame! shame! its starry splendors glow      Above the slaver's loathsome jail;      Its folds are ruffling even now      His crimson flag of sale.       Still round our country's proudest hall      The trade in human flesh is driven,      And at each careless hammer-fall      A human heart is riven.       And this, too, sanctioned by the men      Vested with power to shield the right,      And throw each vile and robber den      Wide open to the light.       Yet, shame upon them! there they sit,      Men of the North, subdued and still;      Meek, pliant poltroons, only fit      To work a master's will.       Sold, bargained off for Southern votes,      A passive herd of Northern mules,      Just braying through their purchased throats      Whate'er their owner rules.       And he, (2) the basest of the base,      The vilest of the vile, whose name,      Embalmed in infinite disgrace,      Is deathless in its shame!       A tool, to bolt the people's door      Against the people clamoring there,      An ass, to trample on their floor      A people's right of prayer!       Nailed to his self-made gibbet fast,      Self-pilloried to the public view,      A mark for every passing blast      Of scorn to whistle through;       There let him hang, and hear the boast      Of Southrons o'er their pliant tool,--      A new Stylites on his post,      \"Sacred to ridicule!\"       Look we at home! our noble hall,      To Freedom's holy purpose given,      Now rears its black and ruined wall,      Beneath the wintry heaven,       Telling the story of its doom,      The fiendish mob, the prostrate law,      The fiery jet through midnight's gloom,      Our gazing thousands saw.       Look to our State! the poor man's right      Torn from him: and the sons of those      Whose blood in Freedom's sternest fight      Sprinkled the Jersey snows,       Outlawed within the land of Penn,      That Slavery's guilty fears might cease,      And those whom God created men      Toil on as brutes in peace.       Yet o'er the blackness of the storm      A bow of promise bends on high,      And gleams of sunshine, soft and warm,      Break through our clouded sky.       East, West, and North, the shout is heard,      Of freemen rising for the right      Each valley hath its rallying word,      Each hill its signal light.       O'er Massachusetts' rocks of gray,      The strengthening light of freedom shines,      Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay,      And Vermont's snow-hung pines!       From Hudson's frowning palisades      To Alleghany's laurelled crest,      O'er lakes and prairies, streams and glades,      It shines upon the West.       Speed on the light to those who dwell      In Slavery's land of woe and sin,      And through the blackness of that bell,      Let Heaven's own light break in.       So shall the Southern conscience quake      Before that light poured full and strong,    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9580"],["title","Anti-Slavery Poems and Songs of Labor and Reform, Complete (#8)"],["body","  So shall the Southern heart awake      To all the bondman's wrong.       And from that rich and sunny land      The song of grateful millions rise,      Like that of Israel's ransomed band      Beneath Arabia's skies:       And all who now are bound beneath      Our banner's shade, our eagle's wing,      From Slavery's night of moral death      To light and life shall spring.       Broken the bondman's chain, and gone      The master's guilt, and hate, and fear,      And unto both alike shall dawn      A New and Happy Year.       1839.     THE RELIC.  Written on receiving a cane wrought from a fragment of the  wood-work of Pennsylvania Hall which the fire had spared.       TOKEN of friendship true and tried,      From one whose fiery heart of youth      With mine has beaten, side by side,      For Liberty and Truth;      With honest pride the gift I take,      And prize it for the giver's sake.       But not alone because it tells      Of generous hand and heart sincere;      Around that gift of friendship dwells      A memory doubly dear;      Earth's noblest aim, man's holiest thought,      With that memorial frail in wrought!       Pure thoughts and sweet like flowers unfold,      And precious memories round it cling,      Even as the Prophet's rod of old      In beauty blossoming:      And buds of feeling, pure and good,      Spring from its cold unconscious wood.       Relic of Freedom's shrine! a brand      Plucked from its burning! let it be      Dear as a jewel from the hand      Of a lost friend to me!      Flower of a perished garland left,      Of life and beauty unbereft!       Oh, if the young enthusiast bears,      O'er weary waste and sea, the stone      Which crumbled from the Forum's stairs,      Or round the Parthenon;      Or olive-bough from some wild tree      Hung over old Thermopylae:       If leaflets from some hero's tomb,      Or moss-wreath torn from ruins hoary;      Or faded flowers whose sisters bloom      On fields renowned in story;      Or fragment from the Alhambra's crest,      Or the gray rock by Druids blessed;       Sad Erin's shamrock greenly growing      Where Freedom led her stalwart kern,      Or Scotia's \"rough bur thistle\" blowing      On Bruce's Bannockburn;      Or Runnymede's wild English rose,      Or lichen plucked from Sempach's snows!       If it be true that things like these      To heart and eye bright visions bring,      Shall not far holier memories      To this memorial cling      Which needs no mellowing mist of time      To hide the crimson stains of crime!       Wreck of a temple, unprofaned;      Of courts where Peace with Freedom trod,      Lifting on high, with hands unstained,      Thanksgiving unto God;      Where Mercy's voice of love was pleading      For human hearts in bondage bleeding;       Where, midst the sound of rushing feet      And curses on the night-air flung,      That pleading voice rose calm and sweet      From woman's earnest tongue;      And Riot turned his scowling glance,      Awed, from her tranquil countenance!       That temple now in ruin lies!      The fire-stain on its shattered wall,      And open to the changing skies      Its black and roofless hall,      It stands before a nation's sight,      A gravestone over buried Right!       But from that ruin, as of old,      The fire-scorched stones themselves are crying,      And from their ashes white and cold      Its timbers are replying!      A voice which slavery cannot kill      Speaks from the crumbling arches still!       And even this relic from thy shrine,      O holy Freedom! Hath to me      A potent power, a voice and sign      To testify of thee;      And, grasping it, methinks I feel      A deeper faith, a stronger zeal.       And not unlike that mystic rod,      Of old stretched o'er the Egyptian wave,      Which opened, in the strength of God,      A pathway for the slave,      It yet may point the bondman's way,      And turn the spoiler from his prey.       1839.     THE WORLD'S CONVENTION OF THE FRIENDS OF EMANCIPATION,  HELD IN LONDON IN 1840.  Joseph Sturge, the founder of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, proposed the calling of a world's anti-slavery convention, and the proposal was promptly seconded by the American Anti-Slavery Society. The call was addressed to \"friends of the slave of every nation and of every clime.\"       YES, let them gather! Summon forth      The pledged philanthropy of Earth.      From every land, whose hills have heard      The bugle blast of Freedom waking;      Or shrieking of her symbol-bird      From out his cloudy eyrie breaking      Where Justice hath one worshipper,      Or truth one altar built to her;       Where'er a human eye is weeping      O'er wrongs which Earth's sad children know;      Where'er a single heart is keeping      Its prayerful watch with human woe      Thence let them come, and greet each other,      And know in each a friend and brother!       Yes, let them come! from each green vale      Where England's old baronial halls      Still bear upon their storied walls      The grim crusader's rusted mail,      Battered by Paynim spear and brand      On Malta's rock or Syria's sand!      And mouldering pennon-staves once set      Within the soil of Palestine,      By Jordan and Gennesaret;      Or, borne with England's battle line,      O'er Acre's shattered turrets stooping,      Or, midst the camp their banners drooping,      With dews from hallowed Hermon wet,      A holier summons now is given      Than that gray hermit's voice of old,      Which unto all the winds of heaven      The banners of the Cross unrolled!      Not for the long-deserted shrine;      Not for the dull unconscious sod,      Which tells not by one lingering sign      That there the hope of Israel trod;      But for that truth, for which alone      In pilgrim eyes are sanctified      The garden moss, the mountain stone,      Whereon His holy sandals pressed,--      The fountain which His lip hath blessed,--       Whate'er hath touched His garment's hem      At Bethany or Bethlehem,      Or Jordan's river-side.      For Freedom in the name of Him      Who came to raise Earth's drooping poor,      To break the chain from every limb,      The bolt from every prison door!      For these, o'er all the earth hath passed      An ever-deepening trumpet blast,      As if an angel's breath had lent      Its vigor to the instrument.       And Wales, from Snowden's mountain wall,      Shall startle at that thrilling call,      As if she heard her bards again;      And Erin's \"harp on Tara's wall\"      Give out its ancient strain,      Mirthful and sweet, yet sad withal,--      The melody which Erin loves,      When o'er that harp, 'mid bursts of gladness      And slogan cries and lyke-wake sadness,      The hand of her O'Connell moves!      Scotland, from lake and tarn and rill,      And mountain hold, and heathery bill,      Shall catch and echo back the note,      As if she heard upon the air      Once more her Cameronian's prayer      And song of Freedom float.      And cheering echoes shall reply      From each remote dependency,      Where Britain's mighty sway is known,      In tropic sea or frozen zone;      Where'er her sunset flag is furling,      Or morning gun-fire's smoke is curling;      From Indian Bengal's groves of palm      And rosy fields and gales of balm,      Where Eastern pomp and power are rolled      Through regal Ava's gates of gold;      And from the lakes and ancient woods      And dim Canadian solitudes,      Whence, sternly from her rocky throne,      Queen of the North, Quebec looks down;      And from those bright and ransomed Isles      Where all unwonted Freedom smiles,      And the dark laborer still retains      The scar of slavery's broken chains!       From the hoar Alps, which sentinel      The gateways of the land of Tell,      Where morning's keen and earliest glance      On Jura's rocky wall is thrown,      And from the olive bowers of France      And vine groves garlanding the Rhone,--      \"Friends of the Blacks,\" as true and tried      As those who stood by Oge's side,      And heard the Haytien's tale of wrong,      Shall gather at that summons strong;      Broglie, Passy, and he whose song      Breathed over Syria's holy sod,      And, in the paths which Jesus trod,      And murmured midst the hills which hem      Crownless and sad Jerusalem,      Hath echoes whereso'er the tone      Of Israel's prophet-lyre is known.       Still let them come; from Quito's walls,      And from the Orinoco's tide,      From Lima's Inca-haunted halls,      From Santa Fe and Yucatan,--      Men who by swart Guerrero's side      Proclaimed the deathless rights of man,      Broke every bond and fetter off,      And hailed in every sable serf      A free and brother Mexican!      Chiefs who across the Andes' chain      Have followed Freedom's flowing pennon,      And seen on Junin's fearful plain,      Glare o'er the broken ranks of Spain      The fire-burst of Bolivar's cannon!      And Hayti, from her mountain land,      Shall send the sons of those who hurled      Defiance from her blazing strand,      The war-gage from her Petion's hand,      Alone against a hostile world.       Nor all unmindful, thou, the while,      Land of the dark and mystic Nile!      Thy Moslem mercy yet may shame      All tyrants of a Christian name,      When in the shade of Gizeh's pile,      Or, where, from Abyssinian hills      El Gerek's upper fountain fills,      Or where from Mountains of the Moon      El Abiad bears his watery boon,      Where'er thy lotus blossoms swim      Within their ancient hallowed waters;      Where'er is beard the Coptic hymn,      Or song of Nubia's sable daughters;      The curse of slavery and the crime,      Thy bequest from remotest time,      At thy dark Mehemet's decree      Forevermore shall pass from thee;      And chains forsake each captive's limb      Of all those tribes, whose"]]]
