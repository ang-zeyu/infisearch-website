And certainly, being no fool, he began to notice that girls here and there had brighter eyes and trimmer waists than I. I do not know what such observations may have led to when he was away from me: I never inquired into it, because in such matters all men are fools. But I put up with no nonsense at home, and he made me a fair husband, as husbands go. That much I will say for him gladly: and if any widow says more than that, Florian, do you beware of her, for she is an untruthful woman.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" replied Florian, \"it is not quite becoming to speak thus of your dead husband. No doubt you speak the truth: there is no telling what sort of person you may have married in what still seems to me unseemly haste to provide me with a successor: but even so, a little charitable prevarication would be far more edifying.\"  He spoke with such earnestness that there fell a silence. The women seemed to pity him. And in the silence Florian heard from afar young persons returning from the woods behind Storisende, and bringing with them the May-pole. They were still singing.  Sang they:    \"_Unwillingly foreknowing   That love with May-time flees,   We take this day's bestowing,   And feed on fantasies_--\"   4. _Youth Solves It_  The tale tells how lightly and sweetly, and compassionately, too, then spoke young Sylvie de Nointel.  \"Ah, but, assuredly, Messire Florian, you do not argue with my pets quite seriously! Old people always have some such queer notions. Of course love all depends upon what sort of person you are. Now, as I see it, Mama and Grandmama are not the sort of persons who have real love-affairs. Devoted as I am to both of them, I cannot but perceive they are lacking in real depth of sentiment. They simply do not understand or care about such matters. They are fine, straightforward, practical persons, poor dears, and always have been, of course, for in things like that one does not change, as I have often noticed. And Father, and Grandfather Perion, too, as I remember him, was kind-hearted and admirable and all that, but nobody could ever have expected him to be a satisfactory lover. Why, he was bald as an egg, the poor pet!\"  And Sylvie laughed again at the preposterous notions of old people. She flashed an especial smile at Florian. Her hand went out as though to touch him, in an unforgotten gesture. \"Old people do not understand,\" said Sylvie de Nointel, in tones which took this handsome young fellow ineffably into confidence.  \"Mademoiselle,\" said Florian, with a sigh that was part relief and all approval, \"it is you who speak the truth, and your elders have fallen victims to the cynicism of a crassly material age. Love is immortal when it is really love and when one is the right sort of person. There is the love--known to how few, alas! and a passion of which I regret to find your mother incapable--that endures unchanged until the end of life.\"  \"I am so glad you think so, Messire Florian,\" she answered demurely.  \"And do you not think so, mademoiselle?\"  \"How should I know,\" she asked him, \"as yet?\" He noted she had incredibly long lashes.  \"Thrice happy is he that convinces you!\" says Florian. And about them, who were young in the world's recaptured youth, spring triumphed with an ageless rural pageant, and birds cried to their mates. He noted the red brevity of her lips and their probable softness.  Meanwhile the elder women regarded each other.  \"It is the season of May. They are young and they are together. Poor children!\" said Dame Melicent. \"Youth cries to youth for the toys of youth, and saying, 'Lo, I cry with the voice of a great god!'\"  \"Still,\" said Madame Adelaide, \"Puysange is a good fief--\"  But Florian heeded neither of them as he stood there by the sunlit stream, in which no drop of water retained its place for a moment, and which yet did not alter in appearance at all. He did not heed his elders for the excellent reason that Sylvie de Nointel was about to speak, and he preferred to listen to her. For this girl, he knew, was lovelier than any other person had ever been since Eve first raised just such admiring, innocent, and venturesome eyes to inspect what must have seemed to her the quaintest of all animals, called man. So it was with a shrug that Florian remembered how he had earlier fancied other women for one reason or another; since this, he knew, was the great love of his life, and a love which would endure unchanged as long as his life lasted.         *       *       *       *       *  APRIL 14, 1355--OCTOBER 23, 1356  \"_D'aquest segle flac, plen de marrimen, S'amor s'en vai, son jot teinh mensongier_.\"   _So Florian married Sylvie, and made her, they relate, a fair husband, as husbands go. And children came to them, and then old age, and, lastly, that which comes to all._  Which reminds me that it was an uncomfortable number of years ago, in an out-of-the-way corner of the library at Allonby Shaw, that I first came upon_ Les Aventures d'Adhelmar de Nointel. _This manuscript dates from the early part of the fifteenth century and is attributed--though on no very conclusive evidence, says Hinsauf,--to the facile pen of Nicolas de Caen (circa 1450), until lately better known as a lyric poet and satirist._  _The story, told in decasyllabic couplets, interspersed after a rather unusual fashion with innumerable lyrics, seems in the main authentic. Sir Adhelmar de Nointel, born about 1332, was once a real and stalwart personage, a younger brother to that Henri de Nointel, the fighting Bishop of Mantes, whose unsavory part in the murder of Jacques van Arteveldt history has recorded at length; and it is with the exploits of this Adhelmar that the romance deals, not, it may be, without exaggeration._  _In any event, the following is, with certain compressions and omissions that have seemed desirable, the last episode of the_ Aventures. _The tale concerns the children of Florian and Sylvie: and for it I may claim, at least, the same merit that old Nicolas does at the very outset; since as he veraciously declares--yet with a smack of pride:_    _Cette bonne ystoire n'est pas usée,   Ni guère de lieux jadis trouvée,   Ni ècrite par clercz ne fut encore._     CHAPTER II  _The Episode Called Adhelmar at Puysange_   I. _April-magic_  When Adhelmar had ended the tale of Dame Venus and the love which she bore the knight Tannhäuser (here one overtakes Nicolas midcourse in narrative), Adhelmar put away the book and sighed. The Demoiselle Mélite laughed a little--her laughter, as I have told you, was high and delicate, with the resonance of thin glass--and demanded the reason of his sudden grief.  \"I sigh,\" he answered, \"for sorrow that this Dame Venus is dead.\"  \"Surely,\" said she, wondering at his glum face, \"that is no great matter.\"  \"By Saint Vulfran, yes!\" Adhelmar protested; \"for the same Lady Venus was the fairest of women, as all learned clerks avow; and she is dead these many years, and now there is no woman left alive so beautiful as she--saving one alone, and she will have none of me. And therefore,\" he added, very slowly, \"I sigh for desire of Dame Venus and for envy of the knight Tannhäuser.\"  Again Mélite laughed, but she forbore--discreetly enough--to question him concerning the lady who was of equal beauty with Dame Venus.  It was an April morning, and they set in the hedged garden of Puysange. Adhelmar read to her of divers ancient queens and of the love-business wherein each took part, relating the histories of the Lady Heleine and of her sweethearting with Duke Paris, the Emperor of Troy's son, and of the Lady Melior that loved Parthénopex of Blois, and of the Lady Aude, for love of whom Sieur Roland slew the pagan Angoulaffre, and of the Lady Cresseide that betrayed love, and of the Lady Morgaine la Fée, whose Danish lover should yet come from Avalon to save France in her black hour of need. All these he read aloud, suavely, with bland modulations, for he was a man of letters, as letters went in those days. Originally, he had been bred for the Church; but this vocation he had happily forsaken long since, protesting with some show of reason that France at this particular time had a greater need of spears than of aves.  For the rest, Sir Adhelmar de Nointel was known as a valiant knight, who had won glory in the wars with the English. He had lodged for a fortnight at Puysange, of which castle the master, Sire Reinault (son to the late Vicomte Florian) was Adhelmar's cousin: and on the next day Adhelmar proposed to set forth for Paris, where the French King--Jehan the Luckless--was gathering his lieges about him to withstand his kinsman, Edward of England.  Now, as I have said, Adhelmar was cousin to Reinault, and, in consequence, to Reinault's sister, the Demoiselle Mélite; and the latter Adhelmar loved, at least, as much as a cousin should. That was well known; and Reinault de Puysange had sworn very heartily that this was a great pity when he affianced her to Hugues d'Arques. Both Hugues and Adhelmar had loved Mélite since boyhood,--so far their claims ran equally. But while Adhelmar had busied himself in the acquisition of some scant fame and a vast number of scars, Hugues had sensibly inherited the fief of Arques, a snug property with fertile lands and a stout fortress. How, then, should Reinault hesitate between them?  He did not. For the Château d'Arques, you must understand, was builded in Lower Normandy, on the fringe of the hill-country, just where the peninsula of Cotentin juts out into the sea; Puysange stood not far north, among the level lands of Upper Normandy: and these two being the strongest castles in those parts, what more natural and desirable than that the families should be united by marriage? Reinault informed his sister of his decision; she wept a little, but did not refuse to comply.  So Adhelmar, come again to Puysange after five years' absence, found Mélite troth-plighted, fast and safe, to Hugues. Reinault told him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9488"],["title","The Line of Love; Dizain des Mariages (#5)"],["body","grumbled and bit his nails in a corner, for a time; then laughed shortly.  \"I have loved Mélite,\" he said. \"It may be that I love her still. Hah, Saint Vulfran! why should I not? Why should a man not love his cousin?\"  Adhelmar grinned, while the vicomte twitched his beard and wished Adhelmar at the devil.  But the young knight stuck fast at Puysange, for all that, and he and Mélite were much together. Daily they made parties to dance, and to hunt the deer, and to fish, but most often to rehearse songs. For Adhelmar made good songs.  [Footnote: Nicolas indeed declares of Adhelmar, earlier in the tale, in such high terms as are not uncommon to this chronicle:    Hardi estait et fier comme lions,   Et si faisait balades et chançons,   Rondeaulx et laiz, très bans et pleins de grâce,   Comme Orpheus, cet menestrier de Thrace.]  To-day, the summer already stirring in the womb of the year, they sat, as I have said, in the hedged garden; and about them the birds piped and wrangled over their nest-building, and daffodils danced in spring's honor with lively saltations, and overhead the sky was colored like a robin's egg. It was very perilous weather for young folk. By reason of this, when he had ended his reading about the lady of the hollow hill, Sir Adhelmar sighed again, and stared at his companion with hungry eyes, wherein desire strained like a hound at the leash.  Said Mélite, \"Was this Lady Venus, then, exceedingly beautiful?\"  Adhelmar swore an oath of sufficient magnitude that she was.  Whereupon Mélite, twisting her fingers idly and evincing a sudden interest in her own feet, demanded if this Venus were more beautiful than the Lady Ermengarde of Arnaye or the Lady Ysabeau of Brieuc.  \"Holy Ouen!\" scoffed Adhelmar; \"these ladies, while well enough, I grant you, would seem to be callow howlets blinking about that Arabian Phoenix which Plinius tells of, in comparison with this Lady Venus that is dead!\"  \"But how,\" asked Mélite, \"was this lady fashioned that you commend so highly?--and how can you know of her beauty who have never seen her?\"  Said Adhelmar: \"I have read of her fairness in the chronicles of Messire Stace of Thebes, and of Dares, who was her husband's bishop. And she was very comely, neither too little nor too big; she was fairer and whiter and more lovely than any flower of the lily or snow upon the branch, but her eyebrows had the mischance of meeting. She had wide-open, beautiful eyes, and her wit was quick and ready. She was graceful and of demure countenance. She was well-beloved, and could herself love well, but her heart was changeable--\"  \"Cousin Adhelmar,\" declared Mélite, flushing somewhat, for the portrait was like enough, \"I think that you tell of a woman, not of a goddess of heathenry.\"  \"Her eyes,\" said Adhelmar, and his voice shook, and his hands, lifting a little, trembled,--\"her eyes were large and very bright and of a color like that of the June sunlight falling upon deep waters. Her hair was of a curious gold color like the Fleece that the knight Jason sought, and it curled marvellously about her temples. For mouth she had but a small red wound; and her throat was a tower builded of ivory.\"  But now, still staring at her feet and glowing with the even complexion of a rose, (though not ill-pleased), the Demoiselle Mélite bade him desist and make her a song. Moreover, she added, beauty was but a fleeting thing, and she considered it of little importance; and then she laughed again.  Adhelmar took up the lute that lay beside them and fingered it for a moment, as though wondering of what he would rhyme. Afterward he sang for her as they sat in the gardens.  Sang Adhelmar:    _\"It is in vain I mirror forth the praise   In pondered virelais   Of her that is the lady of my love;   Far-sought and curious phrases fail to tell   The tender miracle   Of her white body and the grace thereof.    \"Thus many and many an artful-artless strain   Is fashioned all in vain:   Sound proves unsound; and even her name, that is   To me more glorious than the glow of fire   Or dawn or love's desire   Or opals interlinked with turquoises,   Mocks utterance.    \"So, lacking skill to praise   That perfect bodily beauty which is hers,   Even as those worshippers   Who bore rude offerings of honey and maize,   Their all, into the gold-paved ministers   Of Aphrodite, I have given her these   My faltering melodies,   That are Love's lean and ragged messengers.\"_  When he had ended, Adhelmar cast aside the lute, and caught up both of Mélite's hands, and strained them to his lips. There needed no wizard to read the message in his eyes.  Mélite sat silent for a moment. Presently, \"Ah, cousin, cousin!\" she sighed, \"I cannot love you as you would have me love. God alone knows why, true heart, for I revere you as a strong man and a proven knight and a faithful lover; but I do not love you. There are many women who would love you, Adhelmar, for the world praises you, and you have done brave deeds and made good songs and have served your King potently; and yet\"--she drew her hands away and laughed a little wearily--\"yet I, poor maid, must needs love Hugues, who has done nothing. This love is a strange, unreasoning thing, my cousin.\"  \"But do you in truth love Hugues?\" asked Adhelmar, in a harsh voice.  \"Yes,\" said Mélite, very softly, and afterward flushed and wondered dimly if she had spoken the truth. Then, somehow, her arms clasped about Adhelmar's neck, and she kissed him, from pure pity, as she told herself; for Mélite's heart was tender, and she could not endure the anguish in his face.  This was all very well. But Hugues d'Arques, coming suddenly out of a pleached walk, at this juncture, stumbled upon them and found their postures distasteful. He bent black brows upon the two.  \"Adhelmar,\" said he, at length, \"this world is a small place.\"  Adhelmar rose. \"Indeed,\" he assented, with a wried smile, \"I think there is scarce room in it for both of us, Hugues.\"  \"That was my meaning,\" said the Sieur d'Arques.  \"Only,\" Adhelmar pursued, somewhat wistfully, \"my sword just now, Hugues, is vowed to my King's quarrel. There are some of us who hope to save France yet, if our blood may avail. In a year, God willing, I shall come again to Puysange; and till then you must wait.\"  Hugues conceded that, perforce, he must wait, since a vow was sacred; and Adhelmar, who suspected Hugues' natural appetite for battle to be lamentably squeamish, grinned. After that, in a sick rage, Adhelmar struck Hugues in the face, and turned about.  The Sieur d'Arques rubbed his cheek ruefully. Then he and Mélite stood silent for a moment, and heard Adhelmar in the court-yard calling his men to ride forth; and Mélite laughed; and Hugues scowled.   2. _Nicolas as Chorus_  The year passed, and Adhelmar did not return; and there was much fighting during that interval, and Hugues began to think the knight was slain and would never return to fight with him. The reflection was borne with equanimity.  So Adhelmar was half-forgot, and the Sieur d'Arques turned his mind to other matters. He was still a bachelor, for Reinault considered the burden of the times in ill-accord with the chinking of marriage-bells. They were grim times for Frenchmen: right and left the English pillaged and killed and sacked and guzzled and drank, as if they would never have done; and Edward of England began, to subscribe himself _Rex Franciae_ with some show of excuse.  In Normandy men acted according to their natures. Reinault swore lustily and looked to his defences; Hugues, seeing the English everywhere triumphant, drew a long face and doubted, when the will of God was made thus apparent, were it the part of a Christian to withstand it? Then he began to write letters, but to whom no man at either Arques or Puysange knew, saving One-eyed Peire, who carried them.   3. _Treats of Huckstering_  It was in the dusk of a rain-sodden October day that Adhelmar rode to the gates of Puysange, with some score men-at-arms behind him. They came from Poictiers, where again the English had conquered, and Adhelmar rode with difficulty, for in that disastrous business in the field of Maupertuis he had been run through the chest, and his wound was scarce healed. Nevertheless, he came to finish his debate with the Sieur d'Arques, wound or no wound.  But at Puysange he heard a strange tale of Hugues. Reinault, whom Adhelmar found in a fine rage, told the story as they sat over their supper.  It had happened, somehow, (Reinault said), that the Marshal Arnold d'Andreghen--newly escaped from prison and with his disposition unameliorated by Lord Audley's gaolership,--had heard of these letters that Hugues wrote so constantly; and the Marshal, being no scholar, had frowned at such doings, and waited presently, with a company of horse, on the road to Arques. Into their midst, on the day before Adhelmar came, rode Peire, the one-eyed messenger; and it was not an unconscionable while before Peire was bound hand and foot, and d'Andreghen was reading the letter they had found in Peire's jerkin. \"Hang the carrier on that oak,\" said d'Andreghen, when he had ended, \"but leave that largest branch yonder for the writer. For by the Blood of Christ, our common salvation! I will hang him there on Monday!\"  So Peire swung in the air ere long and stuck out a black tongue at the crows, who cawed and waited for supper; and presently they feasted while d'Andreghen rode to Arques, carrying a rope for Hugues.  For the Marshal, you must understand, was a man of sudden action. Only two months ago, he had taken the Comte de Harcourt with other gentlemen from the Dauphin's own table to behead them that afternoon in a field behind Rouen. It was true they had planned to resist the _gabelle_, the King's immemorial right to impose a tax on salt; but Harcourt was Hugues' cousin, and the Sieur d'Arques, being somewhat of an epicurean disposition, esteemed the dessert accorded his kinsman unpalatable.
