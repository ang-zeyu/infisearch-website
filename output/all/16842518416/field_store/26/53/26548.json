All the men were well armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. The sight of so many horses at once showed Olaf that the journey, whatever its destination, was to be made by land. As they came nearer and halted, his eyes quickly searched among the men for Thorgils Thoralfson. Yes, there indeed was his foster brother, mounted on one of the pack mules, with the sunlight falling on his white kirtle and downbent head! Then Olaf grew calm, for his master had kept his promise, and it mattered little where he was to be taken now that Thorgils was to be with him in his bondage. Sometime--not today, perhaps,--they would have a chance of speaking together and of contriving an escape.  Sigurd, seated on his beautiful white horse, looked like a king surrounded by his bodyguard. He watched Olaf springing on the pony's back, and saw the men securing the boy with ropes. One of the men took the end of the chain, while the other held the pony's halter; and thus, with a mounted guard on each side of him, the young slave was led out through the gates.  Very soon the little town in which he had lived in bondage for seven long years, and the sea that he loved so well, were left far behind. Sigurd and his followers rode southward over the hills, and then through long dreary dales, that were strewn with large boulder stones that made travelling very difficult. There was only a narrow horse track to guide them, and soon even this was lost in the rank herbage, and the land became a wild desolate waste without sign of human dwelling, but only the bare rugged hills, with here and there a thread of water streaming down them into the lower land. Olaf began to feel very weary, and the jolting of the pony over the rough ground became painful to his untrained limbs. But at last the hot sun sank in a blaze of gold, and the first day's journey came to an end.  A halt was made within the shelter of a vast forest of pine trees, at the side of a wide, deep stream. Here the horses and mules were unburdened and allowed to wander, with dogs to watch them lest they strayed too far. Some of the men then set to raising tents, others gathered cones and dry twigs to build a fire, while two mounted guard over their master's moneybags. When all was ready, food and drink were served round to all alike.  At nightfall, Olaf and Thorgils, still chained, were put to sleep on a bed of dry ferns. Near them was another slave, a young man who seemed to be of a foreign land. They watched him silently until he was asleep, then as they lay there with the stars shining down upon them through the dark tree branches, they questioned one the other concerning what had happened to them that day. Olaf asked Thorgils if he had heard the name of their new master.  \"No,\" answered Thorgils. \"Nor can I guess why it is that he has bought us. All that I know is that he is a Norseman, and that he is very rich.\"  \"I can only think,\" said Olaf, \"that he intends some treachery by us, and that he means to take us west over sea and deliver us into the hands of Gunnhild's sons.\"  \"There is little cause to fear such a thing,\" said Thorgils. \"To him we are but as any other slaves that he might buy in the marketplace, and I think he has only chosen us because we are of his own country. Had he discovered that you were your father's son he might indeed design to take us to Norway. But that is not possible. There are none but our two selves in all Esthonia who know that you are Olaf Triggvison, and this man could not by any means have discovered it.\"  Olaf was silent for many moments, then at last he said:  \"Thorgils, I cannot deceive you. This man knows full well whose son I am, and it was I who told him.\"  Thorgils drew in his breath, as if he had received a blow.  \"You told him?\" he cried. \"Oh, rash that you are! Have I not always bidden you keep this secret close in your heart? What need was there to tell your story to the first inquiring stranger who crossed your path? You are over ready with your tongue, and now, alas! our misfortunes must only be greater than before.\"  \"He spoke kindly to me,\" explained Olaf, \"and I could not refuse to answer him when he asked me how I came to be a bond slave. I little thought that he was an enemy.\"  \"You are unskilled in the knowledge of men, Ole,\" returned Thorgils. \"There is a look in his eyes that might soon have told you that there is evil in his heart, and such smooth tongued men as he are not to be trusted. But there is one good thing that your thoughtlessness has done: it has brought us again under one master, so it will go ill if, working together, we cannot contrive to run away, and join some viking ship.\"  \"That will not be easy if our new master should take us to an inland place,\" said Olaf. \"None of his men have the marks of the sea upon them; they are landmen.\"  Thorgils glanced up into the sky and searched for the polar star.  \"We are journeying southward,\" he said presently.  \"And what country lies to the south?\" asked Olaf.  Thorgils could not tell. But he remembered that on a time some merchants had come to the coast from a great city in the south called Mikligard--which was the Norseman's name for Constantinople,--and he guessed that that might be their journey's end.  Then Olaf crept nearer to their sleeping companion and wakened him.  \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"who is this man, our master, and whither is he taking us?\"  \"I cannot tell,\" answered the youth. \"It is but three days since that he bought me, and I can ill understand the tongue these men speak, for I am not of this land. My home is far across the seas.\"  \"In what realm?\" asked Thorgils.  \"In England.\"  \"That must be far away indeed,\" said Olaf, \"for never have I heard of such a land.\"  \"It is an island, out across the Western Sea,\" explained Thorgils; \"often have I heard it named. In that same land it was that King Erik Bloodaxe lived and died. Many vikings out of Norway have crossed the seas for the sake of the wealth they can win from the Angles. And if I were a viking it is to England I would steer my course.\"  \"Gladly would I go with you,\" said the English youth; \"ay, even now, if we could but escape. But it seems that we are journeying away from the seacoast, and there is little hope that we can win our way on board a ship.\"  \"There is hope enough if we do not delay our escape,\" returned Thorgils, looking out to where the campfires burned. He was silent for many minutes, then, laying his hand on the stranger's arm, he asked:  \"What name have you?\"  \"Egbert,\" the lad replied.  \"And how came it,\" inquired Thorgils, \"that you were brought into Esthonia?\"  Egbert then told his story. He was born, he said, in Northumberland. His father, a wealthy armourer and silversmith, had been slain by one of the Northmen who had made a great settlement in that part of the country, and his mother, whose name was Edith, had then wedded the man who had made her a widow. The man was named Grim, and he was a warrior in the service of Erik Bloodaxe, the ruler in those parts. On the death of King Erik, Grim and many of the Norsemen went back to Norway in the train of Queen Gunnhild and Erik's sons, and with him he took his wife and young Egbert. Edith did not live to reach Norway, and Grim, unwilling to be burdened with her son, had sold Egbert into slavery. For ten years the boy had suffered in bondage under different masters, the last of whom--Klerkon Flatface--had brought him into Esthonia.  \"My one wish during all these years,\" said Egbert, \"has been to return to England, where the people are Christian, and do not worship your heathen gods. Many times I have tried to escape, but always without success; for I have had no companions, and it is not easy for one so young as I am to make his way alone through foreign lands.\"  \"What is your age?\" Olaf inquired.  \"Fifteen summers,\" answered Egbert.  Thorgils stood up and leaned his hand against the trunk of a tree, looking down at his two companions.  \"I think,\" said he, \"that it would be a very good thing if we three should run away from this new master of ours--now, while the darkness lasts,--and, keeping in company, try to get back to the coast. There we might take possession of a small sailboat, and so make our way over sea to the land of the Angles. What say you, Ole?\"  Olaf was silent for a while. At last he said:  \"It were much wiser in us to wait until we are old enough to fight our way in the world.\"  \"And you will not try to escape?\" asked Thorgils.  \"No,\" answered Olaf firmly. \"We have a good master. Why should we leave him?\"  \"It is because he has given you that fine cloak that you think him good,\" returned Thorgils tauntingly; \"but, believe me, he has his private reasons for so bribing you. I can well guess what he means to do with you, and I tell you that you will surely rue it if you do not escape while we may; for, if men bear their true nature in their faces, then this man who has bought us has an evil heart.\"  \"And what would it avail if we were to escape?\" asked Olaf. \"Boys as we are, we should be of little use in the world, I think.\"  \"You are afraid!\" cried Thorgils.  \"Yes,\" echoed Egbert, \"you are afraid.\" Then turning to Thorgils, he added: \"But why should we urge the lad against his will? He is but a child, and would only be a burden to us. Let us leave him and go our ways without him.\"  \"You are not of our folk, Egbert,\" returned Thorgils, flinging himself down upon the dry leaves, \"and you do not know what the vow of foster brotherhood means. You ask me to do that which I would sooner die than do. Ole and I will never part until death parts us. And if either should be slain, then the other will avenge his death. If Ole wills to remain in slavery until he is old and gray, then I will always be his companion in bondage. But to escape without him, that will I never do!\"  Nothing more was said. The three boys, weary "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9415"],["title","Olaf the Glorious: A Story of the Viking Age (#5)"],["body","their long journey, curled themselves up to sleep.  So soundly did young Olaf sleep, that at midnight, when a man's hands unbound the chain about his neck he was not awakened. Very cautiously the man took him up in his strong arms, and carried him away among the dark shadows of the trees to a part of the forest far removed from the campfires. And at last he laid the lad down on a bed of dry reeds and moss at the side of the stream, where the bright moon, shining through an open glade, shed its light upon his fair round face and his short gold hair. There the man stood over him, watching him as he dreamed his childish dreams. Then he knelt down and gently drew aside the lad's cloak and opened the front of his kirtle, so that the moonlight fell upon the white skin of his throat and breast.  Suddenly Olaf awoke and saw the dark figure bending over him.  \"Thorgils, Thorgils!\" he cried in alarm.  \"Be silent!\" commanded Sigurd Erikson, gripping the boy's arm. \"No harm will come to you.\"  Olaf struggled to his feet and was about to take to flight, but his master's firm grip held him.  \"Silly child!\" muttered Sigurd. \"Why do you fear me? Have I not already told you that I am your friend?\"  \"I do not trust your friendship,\" answered Olaf angrily, remembering Thorgil's warning. \"And now I believe that you have brought me here only that you may secretly put me to death.\"  \"I have brought you here for your own good, my child,\" said Sigurd softly; \"and I give you my solemn word that no man, whosoever he be, shall do you any injury while I live to be your protector. Be silent, and listen to me.\"  Olaf grew calmer.  \"Yester eve,\" said Sigurd, \"when you told me that you were the son of King Triggvi Olafson, I could not easily believe your tale. But when you spoke your mother's name and told me that she was from Ofrestead, in the Uplands of Norway, then I knew very well that you were telling me the truth. I looked into your eyes and I saw that they were the eyes of Queen Astrid--the fairest woman in all the Northland. In your very words I thought I could hear the music of Queen Astrid's voice--\"  \"Can it be that my mother is known to you?\" cried Olaf eagerly. \"Can it be that you can take me to where she lives?\"  \"Well do I know her,\" answered Sigurd. \"But, alas! it is many summers since I saw her last, nor had I heard any tidings of her for a long, long while, until you told me that she had taken flight from Norway. Tell me now, what is the name of him whose succour she wished to seek in Gardarike?\"  \"Her brother's name,\" said Olaf, \"is Sigurd Erikson.\"  \"I am that same brother,\" smiled Sigurd, taking the boy by the hand; \"and it is because I am your uncle that I now take you with me into Holmgard.\" He drew Olaf nearer to him and put his arm about his neck. \"And you shall live with me as my own dear foster son,\" he added, \"and I will take care of you and teach you all that a king's son should know, so that in the time to come you may be well fitted to claim your dead father's realm. But it is not without great risk that I do this thing, for I well know that there are many men in Norway who would gladly hear of your death. Now, if Gunnhild's sons should learn that you are living in Holmgard they would offer a rich reward to the man who should compass your end. You will be wise, therefore, if you breathe no word of your kinship with Triggvi Olafson. Also, you must betray to no man, not even to your foster brother Thorgils, that I am your uncle, or that I know your name and kin; for it is a law held sacred in Gardarike that no one of royal birth shall abide in the land without the sanction of King Valdemar. If it be known that I am wilfully breaking that law, then both you and I will fall into the sorest trouble.\"  Amazed at hearing all this, and at learning that the man he had taken for a secret enemy was none other than his own uncle, Olaf was speechless. He silently put his hand into Sigurd's great palm, and let himself be led back to the place where Thorgils and Egbert still lay sound asleep.    CHAPTER III: GERDA' S PROPHECY.   On the morrow, when Olaf awoke, he told nothing of this that he had heard concerning his kinship with Sigurd Erikson, and if Thorgils saw that he was very moody and quiet, he no doubt thought that the lad was but sorrowing at being taken away from the sea that he loved so much. And yet Olaf seemed strangely unwilling to favour any plan of escape. Both Thorgils and Egbert were for ever speaking of flight, but Olaf always had some wise reason to offer for yet further delay, and would only shake his head and say that their plans were ill formed. On the second evening of the journey into the south, a halt was made upon the shores of a great inland lake. Thorgils declared that it was a part of the sea, and he urged his two companions to steal away with him under the cover of night so that they might find some fisher's boat and make off with it. But Olaf quickly pointed out that there were no boats to be seen, and that, as the horses and dogs were drinking of the water, it could not be salt like the waters of the great sea. Every day during the long and weary journey Thorgils brought up some new plan. But Olaf was obstinate. So at last the two elder boys, seeing that he was bent upon remaining in bondage, yielded to his stronger will, and agreed to wait in patience and to go with him wheresoever their master had a mind to take them.  The country into which they were taken was in old times called Gardarike. It lay to the southeast of Esthonia, and it was a part of what is now known as the Russian Empire. Many Norsemen lived in that land, and King Valdemar was himself the son of the great Swedish viking, Rurik, who had made conquests and settlements in the countries east of the Baltic Sea. Valdemar held his court at Holmgard--the modern Novgorod. He was a very wise and powerful ruler, and his subjects were prosperous and peaceable, having many useful arts, and carrying on a commerce with the great city of Mikligard. The people were still heathen, worshipping Odin and Thor and the minor gods of the Scandinavians; for the faith of Christendom was as yet but vaguely known to them and little understood.  Sigurd Erikson, who was Valdemar's high steward, lived in the king's palace in great dignity and had many servants. So when he returned with all the treasure that he had gathered as tribute he took Olaf Triggvison into his service. But Thorgils and Egbert were still held as bond slaves and put to hard labour in the king's stables.  The steward was very good to Olaf, and soon grew to love him as his own son, guarding him from all harm, speaking with him whenever chance brought them together, yet never betraying by word or act that the boy was other than a mere thrall, whom he had bought with other chattels during his journey through the king's dominions. Neither did Olaf whisper, even to his foster brother, any word of his close kinship with their new master. Thorgils, who had not forgotten the name of Queen Astrid's brother, might indeed have discovered Olaf's secret. But it so chanced that the king's steward was spoken of only by his title as the Hersir Sigurd, and not as the son of Erik of Ofrestead.  For many months Olaf fulfilled his little duties very meekly, and no one paid great heed to him, for he still bore the traces of his rough work. Sigurd was well satisfied that his secret was safe, and that Valdemar would never discover that his steward was breaking the law. But soon the lad's fair hair grew long and bright, his hands lost their roughness, and his growing beauty of face and limb attracted many eyes. Then Sigurd began to fear, for he knew the penalty he would be forced to pay if it should be discovered that he had wittingly brought a king born youth into the land.  This danger grew greater when it chanced that the Queen Allogia took notice of young Olaf, for the queen was in some sort a spae woman; she was skilled in foretelling the future, and she quickly perceived that the boy's beauty had come to him from some noble ancestor. It seemed that she was bent upon knowing his history, for she besought many persons about the court to tell her whence he had come, and to discover for her the names of his parents. But none could tell.  Now, Allogia was still but two and twenty years of age, and very fair, and the king did not like that she should be seen holding speech with his handsome steward, for fear that Sigurd should win her heart. But one day in the early winter time the queen came upon Sigurd in the great hall, where he was alone with Olaf, teaching the boy to read the runes carved in the black oak behind the king's high seat.  Olaf stood back as she entered, but his eyes rested fearlessly upon her. She wore a blue woven mantle ornamented with lace, and under it a scarlet kirtle with a silver belt. There was a band of gold round her head, and her fine brown hair reached down to her waist on both sides. She approached the steward, and said as he turned to withdraw from the hall:  \"I pray you, go on with your lesson, hersir.\"  \"Your pardon, lady,\" said Sigurd, \"I was but teaching the lad the rune of King Rurik, and it is of no account that I should continue.\"  \"Not often have I heard of a mere slave boy learning runes,\" returned Allogia; \"such knowledge is only meant for those who are of high estate.\" She paused and looked round at Olaf, who stood apart with his hand caressing the head of a great dog that had risen from before the fire. \"And yet,\" added the queen thoughtfully, \"I would say that this boy Ole, as you call him, has no serf's blood in him. His fairness is that of a kingly race. What is his parentage, Hersir Sigurd? You who have shown him so much favour, who have dressed him in such fine clothes, and who even go so far as to teach him the reading of runes, surely know him to be of noble birth. Who is he, I say?\"  This question, coming so directly and from the queen herself, whom"]]]
