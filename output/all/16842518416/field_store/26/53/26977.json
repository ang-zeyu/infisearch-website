I never saw anything more dowdy.\"  \"Dowdy? Is it?\" said Bessie. \"I spent five minutes over it this morning, and twisted it up three times in order to give it that horrid little handle of a jug look which you all aspire to. Well, well, I don't suppose we need add to our rules that the girls who belong to the society are to be fashionable.\"  \"It would be a really good idea if we did,\" said Elma. \"I cannot see why schoolgirls should be a lot of frumps. Our society is to effect a certain object which can never be acquired unaided in a great school like Middleton. We want to be as ladylike, as refined, as nice as if we belonged to a very small and select school. We get the best teaching at Middleton, but I don't suppose we get the best manners.\"  \"Well, let us add all these things to the rules,\" said Gwin, \"and let us begin to put them down at once. First, as to the name. Until we can think of a better we must call it the 'Mutual Improvement Society.'\"  \"A hateful word,\" said Bessie. \"The M.I.S.!\"  \"Yes, it does sound priggish,\" said Elma.  \"Well, I dare say some one will have genius enough to think of a more flashy and brilliant name,\" said Gwin, \"but for the present we will call it the 'Mutual Improvement,' for that is exactly what it means. Now then for the rules.\"  As Gwin spoke she drew in front of her a sheet of foolscap paper; and, dipping her pen in ink, looked eagerly at her three young companions.  \"Rule I.,\" she said.  \"For goodness' sake,\" cried Bessie, \"let Rule I. apply to study. Do let down lightly with regard to tidiness and fashionable hair, and all that sort of thing.\"  \"Yes, we will begin about the most important matters first,\" said Gwin. Here she began to write rapidly in pencil. \"I must copy this out in my best and most copperplate hand presently,\" she continued; \"but while we are correcting matters and getting down our rules somehow pencil will do. Well, Rule I. Shall it be something like this, girls? 'The members of this society are expected to aim for the top of the class in each branch of their study at Middleton School. They are expected to gain at least one prize at the midsummer examination.'\"  \"That sounds rather like emulation coming in,\" interrupted Bessie.  \"It must come in, Bessie--it must,\" said Elma. \"We must have something to work for.\"  \"I thought the love of the thing--\" began poor Bessie.  \"Oh, Bessie Challoner, do shut up. Yes, Gwin, that first rule goes very well,\" said Elma. \"We are to aim for the top of the class, and we are to secure at least one prize each. Hurrah! for the Mutual Improvement Society! Now, then let us get to Rule II.\"  \"That applies to deportment,\" said Gwin. \"'The members of the Mutual Improvement Society are to aim at ladylike manners, they are to refrain from slang in conversation, and they are to refuse to make friends with girls who indulge too largely in that special form of vulgarity.' Poor Kitty Malone!\"  \"But she does not talk slang,\" said Bessie. \"She talks Ireland, and Ireland and England are as far apart as the poles.\"  \"Rule III.,\" continued Gwin, \"relates to tidiness; and now, Bessie, comes your tug of war. 'The members of the society must engage to keep their home things in perfect order, as well as their school desks. They must be neat in their persons, exquisitely clean with regard to hands and teeth, and tidy with regard to hair.'\"  \"I don't think I'll join,\" said Bessie.  \"Nonsense, Bessie; it was you who told us to put all this in. I, as a matter of course, always do these things,\" said Gwin, looking very sweet and the essence of young ladyhood as she spoke.  \"Oh, yes, you dear old thing, you are perfect; but you don't live in the sort of ramshackle house we do,\" said Bessie. \"However, never mind. I am quite agreeable to go in for the tug-of-war. And, now, is there anything else?\"  \"Oh yes, there is,\" said Elma, \"and I think it is a most important thing. 'The members of the Society, as far as they possibly can, are to adhere to fashionable dress, to hair done in a stylish manner, and in short to that distinction of appearance which ought to characterize the lady of the present day.'\"  \"Well done, Elma,\" said Gwin, \"that is a capital rule.\"  \"It is a hateful rule,\" said Bessie. \"I really don't think I can join. I don't know what fashionable clothes are. I never study the fashions. I have not the slightest idea whether sleeves are worn stuck out to the size of a balloon or skin-tight to the arm. All I ask for in a sleeve is that it should be comfortable; all I ask for in a dress is that I should not know I have it on. I like to be warm in winter and cool in summer. More I do not ask for.\"  \"Then the rule will do you a wonderful lot of good,\" said Gwin. \"And now is it decided? If so we will draw up the rules in proper form, and----\"  \"I tell you what,\" said Bessie. \"I have thought of a name and a good one too. Let us call the society the 'Tug-of-war Society.'\"  \"Well done,\" said Gwin; \"that will be capital. And now is there to be a subscription or is there not?\"  \"Oh, certainly,\" said Alice. \"It would make it much more distinguished, and prevent too many girls asking to join. We want to have the Tug-of-War Society rather select, don't we?\"  \"I suppose so,\" said Gwin; \"but I don't think that really depends upon the amount of the subscription. What do you say to half a guinea, girls?\"  Alice looked thoughtful, and Elma's face turned rather pale; but she was the first to say she thought Gwin's suggestion an admirable one.  \"Then that is all right,\" said Gwin, \"and I will set to work to write out the rules as neatly as I can. After they are all set out in due form, we can see if there are any improvements to be suggested.\"  Gwin set to work, bending low over her foolscap paper, and Alice offered to help her. Elma and Bessie wandered out of the room, and soon their conversation turned to the much-discussed subject of Kitty.  Bessie stood up warmly for the harum-scarum Irish girl, as Elma called her.  \"She has a lot of good in her,\" said Bessie warmly. \"She would be a splendid girl if she were tamed down a little. I really don't think we want to take much of the fire out of her; but if she would only restrain some of her wild speeches it would be all the better; for if she remains as frank as she is at present to the end of the chapter she cannot help making enemies.\"  \"I want to ask you a question, Bessie,\" said Elma, dropping her voice to a low tone; \"is it true that Kitty Malone is rich?\"  \"Rich?\" echoed Bessie. \"I really cannot tell you.\"  \"I thought you might happen to know, as you have made such chums with her. She is your greatest friend now at Middle ton School, is she not?\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied Bessie. \"What do you mean by asking me such a strange question, Elma? Alice is far and away my greatest friend, and after Alice I like Gwin best.\"  \"Oh, everybody likes Gwin Harley,\" said Elma; \"who could help it? She is so beautiful to look at, and she has such a delightful, lovely home.\"  \"I cannot see that her having a lovely, delightful home has anything to do with our liking her,\" said honest Bessie.  \"Not to you perhaps,\" answered Elma, and a queer look, half-wistful, half-defiant, came into her eyes.  \"I thought you would be sure to be able to tell me if Kitty were rich,\" she said again after a pause.  \"I cannot. You must ask Alice--she lives with Alice. She has plenty of pretty dresses, and all that sort of thing; but I don't know anything about her having money.\"  \"I will run into the house this minute and ask Alice,\" said Elma.  \"Do, of course, if you are anxious; but I cannot imagine what difference it makes to you.\"  \"No, it doesn't, but I am just curious on the subject. I won't keep you long.\"  Elma dashed into the house. She presently came back.  \"I have found out all about it,\" she said.  \"All about what?\" asked Bessie.  \"What I went into the house for. How forgetful you are, Bessie!\"  \"I was wondering if I might steal into the library,\" said Bessie. \"I did not get all the information I wanted about magnetic iron ore, but--Well, what is it, Elma?\"  \"Kitty Malone is rich, very rich, and----\"  \"I can't see that it matters,\" said Bessie--\"I mean to us.\"  \"Oh, but it matters a good deal. You don't understand. I shall certainly vote that we ask her to join the Tug-of-War Society.\"  \"You will?\" cried Bessie--a look of great pleasure came into her eyes. \"Then I am really glad, for to join such a society would do Kitty more good than anything else in the world. Only the nicest girls will belong, and she will get at once into the best set. She is as wild as she can be, but she has got plenty of honor; and if she once gave her word that she would do a certain thing no one would do it better.\"  \"Let us have her by all means. Let us put it to the vote as soon as we go back to the house,\" said Elma. \"Come Bessie, no slinking away in the direction of that fascinating library. They have nearly copied the rules, and we are to read them over and make comments.\"  \"I think it will be a delightful society,\" said Bessie. \"I am sure it will do me good.\"  \"It is meant to do us all good,\" said Elma. \"Tug-of-war! I should rather think it will be! How I shall hate that terrible effort to get to the head of my class; not that I am stupid or dislike my lessons.\"  \"That would be the nice part as far as I am concerned,\" said Bessie; \"but oh! the fashionable sleeves and the stylish hair. Oh dear! I often feel inclined to have my hair cut short.\"  \"Well, Bessie, you would be a fool if you did,\" said Elma. \"Your splendid hair; why, it's nearly down to your knees.\"  \"Yes, and that's the bother,\" said Bessie, \"for mother insists on my brushing it out every night for at least ten minutes, and all that time is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#0)"],["body","AND BOLD   Or   THE FORTUNES OF ROBERT RUSHTON   By   HORATIO ALGER JR.     CHAPTER I.   THE YOUNG RIVALS.  The main schoolroom in the Millville Academy was brilliantly lighted, and the various desks were occupied by boys and girls of different ages from ten to eighteen, all busily writing under the general direction of Professor George W. Granville, Instructor in Plain and Ornamental Penmanship.  Professor Granville, as he styled himself, was a traveling teacher, and generally had two or three evening schools in progress in different places at the same time. He was really a very good penman, and in a course of twelve lessons, for which he charged the very moderate price of a dollar, not, of course, including stationery, he contrived to impart considerable instruction, and such pupils as chose to learn were likely to profit by his instructions. His venture in Millville had been unusually successful. There were a hundred pupils on his list, and there had been no disturbance during the course of lessons.  At nine precisely, Professor Granville struck a small bell, and said, in rather a nasal voice:  \"You will now stop writing.\"  There was a little confusion as the books were closed and the pens were wiped.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said the professor, placing one arm under his coat tails and extending the other in an oratorical attitude, \"this evening completes the course of lessons which I have had the honor and pleasure of giving you. I have endeavored to impart to you an easy and graceful penmanship, such as may be a recommendation to you in after life. It gives me pleasure to state that many of you have made great proficiency, and equaled my highest expectations. There are others, perhaps, who have not been fully sensible of the privileges which they enjoyed. I would say to you all that perfection is not yet attained. You will need practice to reap the full benefit of my instructions. Should my life be spared, I shall hope next winter to give another course of writing lessons in this place, and I hope I may then have the pleasure of meeting you again as pupils. Let me say, in conclusion, that I thank you for your patronage and for your good behavior during this course of lessons, and at the same time I bid you good-by.\"  With the closing words, Professor Granville made a low bow, and placed his hand on his heart, as he had done probably fifty times before, on delivering the same speech, which was the stereotyped form in which he closed his evening schools.  There was a thumping of feet, mingled with a clapping of hands, as the professor closed his speech, and a moment later a boy of sixteen, occupying one of the front seats, rose, and, advancing with easy self-possession, drew from his pocket a gold pencil case, containing a pencil and pen, and spoke as follows:  \"Professor Granville, the members of your writing class, desirous of testifying their appreciation of your services as teacher, have contributed to buy this gold pencil case, which, in their name, I have great pleasure in presenting to you. Will you receive it with our best wishes for your continued success as a teacher of penmanship?\"  With these words, he handed the pencil to the professor and returned to his seat.  The applause that ensued was terrific, causing the dust to rise from the floor where it had lain undisturbed till the violent attack of two hundred feet raised it in clouds, through which the figure of the professor was still visible, with his right arm again extended.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he commenced, \"I cannot give fitting utterance to the emotions that fill my heart at this most unexpected tribute of regard and mark of appreciation of my humble services. Believe me, I shall always cherish it as a most valued possession, and the sight of it will recall the pleasant, and, I hope, profitable hours which we have passed together this winter. To you, in particular, Mr. Rushton, I express my thanks for the touching and eloquent manner in which you have made the presentation, and, in parting with you all, I echo your own good wishes, and shall hope that you may be favored with an abundant measure of health and prosperity.\"  This speech was also vociferously applauded. It was generally considered impromptu, but was, in truth, as stereotyped as the other. Professor Granville had on previous occasions been the recipient of similar testimonials, and he had found it convenient to have a set form of acknowledgment. He was wise in this, for it is a hard thing on the spur of the moment suitably to offer thanks for an unexpected gift.  \"The professor made a bully speech,\" said more than one after the exercises were over.  \"So did Bob Rushton,\" said Edward Kent.  \"I didn't see anything extraordinary in what he said,\" sneered Halbert Davis. \"It seemed to me very commonplace.\"  \"Perhaps you could do better yourself, Halbert,\" said Kent.  \"Probably I could,\" said Halbert, haughtily.  \"Why didn't you volunteer, then?\"  \"I didn't care to have anything to do with it,\" returned Halbert, scornfully.  \"That's lucky,\" remarked Edward, \"as there was no chance of your getting appointed.\"  \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Halbert, angrily.  \"No, I was only telling the truth.\"  Halbert turned away, too disgusted to make any reply. He was a boy of sixteen, of slender form and sallow complexion, dressed with more pretension than taste. Probably there was no boy present whose suit was of such fine material as his. But something more than fine clothes is needed to give a fine appearance, and Halbert's mean and insignificant features were far from rendering him attractive, and despite the testimony of his glass, Halbert considered himself a young man of distinguished appearance, and was utterly blind to his personal defects.  What contributed to feed his vanity was his position as the son of the richest man in Millville. Indeed, his father was superintendent, and part owner, of the great brick factory on the banks of the river, in which hundreds found employment. Halbert found plenty to fawn upon him, and was in the habit of strutting about the village, swinging a light cane, neither a useful nor an ornamental member of the community.  After his brief altercation with Edward Kent, he drew on a pair of kid gloves, and looked about the room for Hester Paine, the lawyer's daughter, the reigning belle among the girls of her age in Millville. The fact was, that Halbert was rather smitten with Hester, and had made up his mind to escort her home on this particular evening, never doubting that his escort would be thankfully accepted.  But he was not quick enough, Robert Rushton had already approached Hester, and said, \"Miss Hester, will you allow me to see you home?\"  \"I shall be very glad to have your company, Robert,\" said Hester.  Robert was a general favorite. He had a bright, attractive face, strong and resolute, when there was occasion, frank and earnest at all times. His clothes were neat and clean, but of a coarse, mixed cloth, evidently of low price, suiting his circumstances, for he was poor, and his mother and himself depended mainly upon his earnings in the factory for the necessaries of life. Hester Paine, being the daughter of a well-to-do lawyer, belonged to the village aristocracy, and so far as worldly wealth was concerned, was far above Robert Rushton. But such considerations never entered her mind, as she frankly, and with real pleasure, accepted the escort of the poor factory boy.  Scarcely had she done so when Halbert Davis approached, smoothing his kid gloves, and pulling at his necktie.  \"Miss Hester,\" he said, consequentially, \"I shall have great pleasure in escorting you home.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Hester, \"but I am engaged.\"  \"Engaged!\" repeated Halbert, \"and to whom?\"  \"Robert Rushton has kindly offered to take me home.\"  \"Robert Rushton!\" said Halbert, disdainfully. \"Never mind. I will relieve him of his duty.\"  \"Thank you, Halbert,\" said Robert, who was standing by, \"I won't trouble you. I will see Miss Paine home.\"  \"Your escort was accepted because you were the first to offer it,\" said Halbert.  \"Miss Hester,\" said Robert, \"I will resign in favor of Halbert, if you desire it.\"  \"I don't desire it,\" said the young girl, promptly. \"Come, Robert, I am ready if you are.\"  With a careless nod to Halbert, she took Robert's arm, and left the schoolhouse. Mortified and angry, Halbert looked after them, muttering, \"I'll teach the factory boy a lesson. He'll be sorry for his impudence yet.\"     CHAPTER II.   PUNISHING A COWARD  Mrs. Rushton and her son occupied a little cottage, not far from the factory. Behind it were a few square rods of garden, in which Robert raised a few vegetables, working generally before or after his labor in the factory. They lived in a very plain way, but Mrs. Rushton was an excellent manager, and they had never lacked the common comforts of life. The husband and father had followed the sea. Two years before, he left the port of Boston as captain of the ship _Norman_, bound for Calcutta. Not a word had reached his wife and son since then, and it was generally believed that it had gone to the bottom of the sea. Mrs. Rushton regarded herself as a widow, and Robert, entering the factory, took upon himself the support of the family. He was now able to earn six dollars a week, and this, with his mother's earnings in braiding straw for a hat manufacturer in a neighboring town, supported them, though they were unable to lay up anything. The price of a term at the writing school was so small that Robert thought he could indulge himself in it, feeling that a good handwriting was a valuable acquisition, and might hereafter procure him employment in some business house. For the present, he could not do better than to retain his place in the factory.  Robert was up at six the next morning. He spent half an hour in sawing and splitting wood enough to last his mother through the day, and then entered the kitchen, where breakfast"]]]
