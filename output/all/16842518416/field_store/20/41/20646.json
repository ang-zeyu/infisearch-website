This done, he swam over to where Lightfoot was watching.  \"Hello, Lightfoot!\" he exclaimed. \"You are looking handsomer than ever. How are you feeling these fine autumn days?\"  \"Anxious,\" replied Lightfoot.  \"I am feeling terribly anxious. Do you know what day this is?\"  \"No,\" replied Paddy, \"I don't know what day it is, and I don't particularly care.  It is enough for me that it is one of the finest days we've had for a long time.\"  \"I wish I could feel that way,\" said Lightfoot wistfully.  \"I wish I could feel that way, Paddy, but I can't.  No, Sir, I can't. You see, this is the first of the most dreadful days in all the year for me.  The hunters started looking for me before Mr. Sun was really out of bed.  At least one hunter did, and I don't doubt there are others.  I fooled that one, but from now to the end of the hunting season there will not be a single moment of daylight when I will feel absolutely safe.\"  Paddy crept out on the bank and chewed a little twig of poplar thoughtfully.  Paddy says he can always think better if he is chewing something.  \"That's bad news, Lightfoot.  I'm sorry to hear it.  I certainly am sorry to hear it,\" said Paddy.  \"Why anybody wants to hunt such a handsome fellow as you are, I cannot understand.  My, but that's a beautiful set of antlers you have!\"  \"They are the best I've ever had; but do you know, Paddy, I suspect that they may be one of the reasons I am hunted so,\" replied Lightfoot a little sadly.  \"Good looks are not always to be desired.  Have you seen any hunters around here lately?\"  Paddy shook his Lead.  \"Not a single hunter,\" he replied.  \"I tell you what it is, Lightfoot, let's be partners for a while. You stay right around my pond.  If I see or hear or smell anything suspicious, I'll warn you.  You do the same for me.  Two sets of eyes, ears and noses are better than one.  What do you say, Lightfoot?\"  \"I'll do it,\" replied Lightfoot.     CHAPTER XIV: How Paddy Warned Lightfoot   It was a queer partnership, that partnership between Lightfoot and Paddy, but it was a good partnership.  They had been the best of friends for a long time.  Paddy had always been glad to have Lightfoot visit his pond.  To tell the truth, he was rather fond of handsome Lightfoot.  You know Paddy is himself not at all handsome.  On land he is a rather clumsy-looking fellow and really homely.  So he admired Lightfoot greatly.  That is one reason why he proposed that they be partners.  Lightfoot himself thought the idea a splendid one.  He spent that night browsing not far from Paddy's pond.  With the coming of daylight he lay down in a thicket of young hemlock-trees near the upper end of the pond.  It was a quiet, peaceful day.  It was so quiet and peaceful and beautiful it was hard to believe that hunters with terrible guns were searching the Green Forest for beautiful Lightfoot.  But they were, and Lightfoot knew that sooner or later one of them would be sure to visit Paddy's pond. So, though he rested and took short naps all through that beautiful day, he was anxious.  He couldn't help but be.  The next morning found Lightfoot back in the same place.  But this morning he took no naps.  He rested, but all the time he was watchful and alert.  A feeling of uneasiness possessed him. He felt in his bones that danger in the shape of a hunter with a terrible gun was not far distant.  But the hours slipped away, and little by little he grew less uneasy. He began to hope that that day would prove as peaceful as the previous day had been.  Then suddenly there was a sharp report from the farther end of Paddy's pond.  It was almost like a pistol shot. However, it wasn't a pistol shot.  It wasn't a shot at all. It was the slap of Paddy's broad tail on the surface of the water. Instantly Lightfoot was on his feet.  He knew just what that meant. He knew that Paddy had seen or heard or smelled a hunter.  It was even so.  Paddy had heard a dry stick snap.  It was a very tiny snap, but it was enough to warn Paddy.  With only his head above water he had watched in the direction from which that sound had come.  Presently, stealing quietly along towards the pond, a hunter had come in view.  Instantly Paddy had brought his broad tail down on the water with all his force.  He knew that Lightfoot would know that that meant danger.  Then Paddy had dived, and swimming under water, had sought the safety of his house. He had done his part, and there was nothing more he could do.     CHAPTER XV: The Three Watchers   When Paddy the Beaver slapped the water with his broad tail, making a noise like a pistol shot, Lightfoot understood that this was meant as a warning of danger.  He was on his feet instantly, with eyes, ears and nose seeking the cause of Paddy's warning. After a moment or two he stole softly up to the top of a little ridge some distance back from Paddy's pond, but from the top of which he could see the whole of the pond.  There he hid among some close-growing young hemlock-trees.  It wasn't long before he saw a hunter with a terrible gun come down to the shore of the pond.  Now the hunter had heard Paddy slap the water with his broad tail.  Of course.  There would have been something very wrong with his ears had he failed to hear it.  \"Confound that Beaver!\" muttered the hunter crossly.  \"If there was a Deer anywhere around this pond, he probably is on his way now. I'll have a look around and see if there are any signs.\"  So the hunter went on to the edge of Paddy's pond and then began to walk around it, studying the ground as he walked.  Presently he found the footprints of Lightfoot in the mud where Lightfoot had gone down to the pond to drink.  \"I thought as much,\" muttered the hunter.  \"Those tracks were made last night.  That Deer probably was lying down somewhere near here, and I might have had a shot but for that pesky Beaver. I'll just look the land over, and then I think I'll wait here awhile.  If that Deer isn't too badly scared, he may come back.\"  So the hunter went quite around the pond, looking into all likely hiding-places.  He found where Lightfoot had been lying, and he knew that in all probability Lightfoot had been there when Paddy gave the danger signal.  \"It's of no use for me to try to follow him,\" thought the hunter.  \"It is too dry for me to track him. He may not be so badly scared, after all.  I'll just find a good place and wait.\"  So the hunter found an old log behind some small trees and there sat down.  He could see all around Paddy's pond.  He sat perfectly still.  He was a clever hunter and he knew that so long as he did not move he was not likely to be noticed by any sharp eyes that might come that way.  What he didn't know was that Lightfoot had been watching him all the time and was even then standing where he could see him.  And another thing he didn't know was that Paddy the Beaver had come out of his house and, swimming under water, had reached a hiding-place on the opposite shore from which he too had seen the hunter sit down on the log. So the hunter watched for Lightfoot, and Lightfoot and Paddy watched the hunter.     CHAPTER XVI: Visitors To Paddy's Pond   That hunter was a man of patience.  Also he was a man who understood the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows.  He knew that if he would not be seen he must not move. So he didn't move.  He kept as motionless as if he were a part of the very log on which he was sitting.  For some time there was no sign of any living thing.  Then, from over the tree tops in the direction of the Big River, came the whistle of swift wings, and Mr. and Mrs. Quack alighted with a splash in the pond.  For a few moments they sat on the water, a picture of watchful suspicion.  They were looking and listening to make sure that no danger was near.  Satisfied at last, they began to clean their feathers.  It was plain that they felt safe. Paddy the Beaver was tempted to warn them that they were not as safe as they thought, but as long as the hunter did not move Paddy decided to wait.  Now the hunter was sorely tempted to shoot these Ducks, but he knew that if he did he would have no chance that day to get Lightfoot the Deer, and it was Lightfoot he wanted.  So Mr. and Mrs. Quack swam about within easy range of that terrible gun without once suspecting that danger was anywhere near.  By and by the hunter's keen eyes caught a movement at one end of Paddy's dam.  An instant later Bobby Coon appeared.  It was clear that Bobby was quite unsuspicious.  He carried something, but just what the hunter could not make out.  He took it down to the edge of the water and there carefully washed it.  Then he climbed up on Paddy's dam and began to eat.  You know Bobby Coon is very particular about his food.  Whenever there is water near, Bobby washes his food before eating.  Once more the hunter was tempted, but did not yield to the temptation, which was a very good thing for Bobby Coon.  All this Lightfoot saw as he stood among the little hemlock-trees at the top of the ridge behind the hunter.  He saw and he understood.  \"It is because he wants to kill me that he doesn't shoot at Mr. and Mrs. Quack or Bobby Coon,\" thought Lightfoot a little bitterly.  \"What have I ever done that he should be so anxious to kill me?\"  Still the hunter sat without moving.  Mr. and Mrs. Quack contentedly hunted for food in the mud at the bottom of Paddy's pond.  Bobby Coon finished his meal, crossed the dam and disappeared in the Green Forest.  He had gone off to take a nap somewhere.  Time slipped away.  The hunter continued to watch patiently for Lightfoot, and Lightfoot and Paddy the Beaver watched the hunter.  Finally, another visitor appeared at the upper end of the pond--a visitor in a wonderful coat of red. It was Reddy Fox.     CHAPTER XVII: Sammy Jay Arrives   When Reddy Fox arrived at the pond of Paddy the Beaver, the hunter who was hiding there saw him instantly.  So did Lightfoot. But no one else did.  He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4670"],["title","Lightfoot the Deer (#5)"],["body","in that cautious, careful way that he always uses when he is hunting.  The instant he reached a place where he could see all over Paddy's pond, he stopped as suddenly as if he had been turned to stone.  He stopped with one foot lifted in the act of taking a step.  He had seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack.  Now you know there is nothing Reddy Fox likes better for a dinner than a Duck.  The instant he saw Mr. and Mrs. Quack, a gleam of longing crept into his eyes and his mouth began to water. He stood motionless until both Mr. and Mrs. Quack had their heads under water as they searched for food in the mud in the bottom of the pond.  Then like a red flash he bounded out of sight behind the dam of Paddy the Beaver.  Presently the hunter saw Reddy's black nose at the end of the dam as Reddy peeped around it to watch Mr. and Mrs. Quack.  The latter were slowly moving along in that direction as they fed.  Reddy was quick to see this.  If he remained right where he was, and Mr. And Mrs. Quack kept on feeding in that direction, the chances were that he would have a dinner of fat Duck.  All he need do was to be patient and wait.  So, with his eyes fixed fast on Mr. and Mrs. Quack, Reddy Fox crouched behind Paddy's dam and waited.  Watching Reddy and the Ducks, the hunter almost forgot Lightfoot the Deer.  Mr. and Mrs. Quack were getting very near to where Reddy was waiting for them.  The hunter was tempted to get up and frighten those Ducks.  He didn't want Reddy Fox to have them, because he hoped some day to get them himself.  \"I suppose,\" thought he, \"I was foolish not to shoot them when I had the chance.  They are too far away now, and it looks very much as if that red rascal will get one of them.  I believe I'll spoil that red scamp's plans by frightening them away.  I don't believe that Deer will be back here to-day anyway, so I may as well save those Ducks.\"  But the hunter did nothing of the kind.  You see, just as he was getting ready to step out from his hiding-place, Sammy Jay arrived.  He perched in a tree close to the end of Paddy's dam and at once he spied Reddy Fox.  It didn't take him a second to discover what Reddy was hiding there for.  \"Thief, thief, thief!\" screamed Sammy, and then looked down at Reddy with a mischievous look in his sharp eyes.  There is nothing Sammy Jay delights in more than in upsetting the plans of Reddy Fox.  At the sound of Sammy's voice, Mr. and Mrs. Quack swam hurriedly towards the middle of the pond.  They knew exactly what that warning meant.  Reddy Fox looked up at Sammy Jay and snarled angrily. Then, knowing it was useless to hide longer, he bounded away through the Green Forest to hunt elsewhere.     CHAPTER XVIII: The Hunter Loses His Temper   The hunter, hidden near the pond of Paddy the Beaver, chuckled silently.  That is to say, he laughed without making any sound.  The hunter thought the warning of Mr. and Mrs. Quack by Sammy Jay was a great joke on Reddy.  To tell the truth, he was very much pleased.  As you know, he wanted those Ducks himself. He suspected that they would stay in that little pond for some days, and he planned to return there and shoot them after he had got Lightfoot the Deer.  He wanted to get Lightfoot first, and he knew that to shoot at anything else might spoil his chance of getting a shot at Lightfoot.  \"Sammy Jay did me a good turn,\" thought the hunter, \"although he doesn't know it.  Reddy Fox certainly would have caught one of those Ducks had Sammy not come along just when he did.  It would have been a shame to have had one of them caught by that Fox. I mean to get one, and I hope both of them, myself.\"  Now when you come to think of it, it would have been a far greater shame for the hunter to have killed Mr. and Mrs. Quack than for Reddy Fox to have done so.  Reddy was hunting them because he was hungry.  The hunter would have shot them for sport.  He didn't need them.  He had plenty of other food. Reddy Fox doesn't kill just for the pleasure of killing.  So the hunter continued to sit in his hiding-place with very friendly feelings for Sammy Jay.  Sammy watched Reddy Fox disappear and then flew over to that side of the pond where the hunter was.  Mr. and Mrs. Quack called their thanks to Sammy, to which he replied, that he had done no more for them than he would do for anybody, or than they would have done for him.  For some time Sammy sat quietly in the top of the tree, but all the time his sharp eyes were very busy.  By and by he spied the hunter sitting on the log.  At first he couldn't make out just what it was he was looking at.  It didn't move, but nevertheless Sammy was suspicious.  Presently he flew over to a tree where he could see better.  Right away he spied the terrible gun, and he knew just what that was.  Once more he began to yell, \"Thief! thief! thief!\" at the top of his lungs.  It was then that the hunter lost his temper.  He knew that now he had been discovered by Sammy Jay, and it was useless to remain there longer.  He was angry clear through.     CHAPTER XIX: Sammy Jay Is Modest   As soon as the angry hunter with the terrible gun had disappeared among the trees of the Green Forest, and Lightfoot was sure that he had gone for good, Lightfoot came out from his hiding-place on top of the ridge and walked down to the pond of Paddy the Beaver for a drink.  He knew that it was quite safe to do so, for Sammy Jay had followed the hunter, all the time screaming, \"Thief! thief! thief!\"  Every one within hearing could tell just where that hunter was by Sammy's voice.  It kept growing fainter and fainter, and by that Lightfoot knew that the hunter was getting farther and farther away.  Paddy the Beaver swam out from his hiding-place and climbed out on the bank near Lightfoot.  There was a twinkle in his eyes.  \"That blue-coated mischief-maker isn't such a bad fellow at heart, after all, is he?\" said he.  Lightfoot lifted his beautiful head and set his ears forward to catch the sound of Sammy's voice in the distance.  \"Sammy Jay may be a mischief-maker, as some people say,\" said he, \"but you can always count on him to prove a true friend in time of danger.  He brought me warning of the coming of the hunter the other morning.  You saw him save Mr. and Mrs. Quack a little while ago, and then he actually drove that hunter away.  I suppose Sammy Jay has saved more lives than any one I know of.  I wish he would come back here and let me thank him.\"  Some time later Sammy Jay did come back.  \"Well,\" said he, as he smoothed his feathers, \"I chased that fellow clear to the edge of the Green Forest, so I guess there will be nothing more to fear from him today.  I'm glad to see he hasn't got you yet, Lightfoot.  I've been a bit worried about you.\"  \"Sammy,\" said Lightfoot, \"you are one of the best friends I have.  I don't know how I can ever thank you for what you have done for me.\"  \"Don't try,\" replied Sammy shortly.  \"I haven't done anything but what anybody else would have done. Old Mother Nature gave me a pair of good eyes and a strong voice.  I simply make the best use of them I can.  Just to see a hunter with a terrible gun makes me angry clear through.   I'd rather spoil his hunting than eat.\"  \"You want to watch out, Sammy. One of these days a hunter will lose his temper and shoot you, just to get even with you,\" warned Paddy the Beaver.  \"Don't worry about me,\" replied Sammy.  \"I know just how far those terrible guns can shoot, and I don't take any chances. By the way, Lightfoot, the Green Forest is full of hunters looking for you.  I 've seen a lot of them, and I know they are looking for you because they do not shoot at anybody else even when they have a chance.\"     CHAPTER XX: Lightfoot Hears A Dreadful Sound   Day after day, Lightfoot the Deer played hide and seek for his life with the hunters who were seeking to kill him.  He saw them many times, though not one of them saw him.  More than once a hunter passed close to Lightfoot's hiding-place without once suspecting it.  But poor Lightfoot was feeling the strain.  He was growing thin, and he was so nervous that the falling of a dead leaf from a tree would startle him.  There is nothing quite so terrible as being continually hunted.  It was getting so that Lightfoot half expected a hunter to step out from behind every tree.  Only when the Black Shadows wrapped the Green Forest in darkness did he know a moment of peace.  And those hours of safety were filled with dread of what the next day might bring.  Early one morning a terrible sound rang through the Green Forest and brought Lightfoot to his feet with a startled jump.  It was the baying of hounds following a trail.  At first it did not sound so terrible.  Lightfoot had often heard it before.  Many times he had listened to the baying of Bowser the Hound, as he followed Reddy Fox.  It had not sounded so terrible then because it meant no danger to Lightfoot.  At first, as he listened early that morning, he took it for granted that those hounds were after Reddy, and so, though startled, he was not worried.  But suddenly a dreadful suspicion came to him and he grew more and more anxious as he listened. In a few minutes there was no longer any doubt in his mind. Those hounds were following his trail.  It was then that the sound of that baying became terrible.  He must run for his life! Those hounds would give him no rest.  And he knew that in running from them, he would no longer be able to watch so closely for the hunters with terrible guns.  He would no longer be able to hide in thickets.  At any time he might be driven right past one of those hunters.  Lightfoot bounded away with such leaps as only Lightfoot can make. In a little while the voices of the hounds grew fainter. Lightfoot stopped to get his breath and stood trembling as he listened.  The baying of the hounds again grew louder and louder.  Those wonderful noses of theirs were following his trail without the least difficulty.  In a panic of fear, Lightfoot bounded away"]]]
