The raiding party consisted of sixteen N.C.O.'s and men under Lieutenant Bole.  A gap was blown in the enemy wire by the explosion of an ammonal tube. Immediately Lieutenant Bole, who had gathered his men at the head of the sap running outward from our front line, led the way through the broken wire in the hope of gaining the position in one rush.  They were met, however, by a storm of bombs and machine-gun fire, and fell rapidly.  But even the wounded, if not utterly disabled, kept on hurling their bombs.  Lance-Corporal Reynolds, though already hit, succeeded in reaching the enemy's parapet and delivering all his bombs with deadly effect among the packed ranks.  Then, finding himself alone, he withdrew, and dropped, with two more wounds, a few yards back from the parapet.  By this time every member of the party was down except Lieutenant Bole, who occupied himself calmly with the task of rescuing his wounded.  Lieutenant Churchill came to his aid in this, while Lieutenant Munn, taking his Lewis gun out into No Man's Land, played it along the enemy's parapet to keep down their fire.  Under cover of this gun, and of a trench-mortar barrage which was presently dropped along the trench, Lieutenant Bole got all his wounded, one by one, back through the sap and into our lines.  And so the affair ended--not, indeed, with success, but with great distinction for all concerned, and with the consolation of having exacted a heavy toll in German lives.  It may be in place here to give an interesting instance of the work that was being done by our Tunnelling Companies--work calling for not only great courage and devotion, but also the highest technical skill and resource.  The work of a tunnelling company at the Front is like a duel with knives in a dark room, where one may feel at any moment the stealthy adversary's knife in one's back.  The tunnellers' ears, nerves, and intuition are ceaselessly on the strain.  And just when he has successfully mined his opponents and is about to blow them up, he may be counter-mined himself and hurled into eternity.  At the position known as \"The Bluff,\" overlooking the Canal, a mine had been blown by the enemy on July 25th, forming a new crater of which we had at once taken possession.  By the explosion a lip was formed on the east side of the crater, which was capable of being transformed into an extremely strong position.  But it was impossible to work on this position with any degree of safety, as it was certain that the enemy's gallery, from which he had laid the mine, ran somewhere beneath the lip, and was occupied.  Any work we should attempt on the position would inevitably be heard in the gallery and could be frustrated, disastrously for us, by the explosion of another mine.  It was decided to try to tunnel into the gallery from another direction.  Bore-holes, therefore, were driven in the supposed direction of the gallery, in the hope of being able to locate it exactly by listening.  In this the borers were so successful that they came upon the gallery before they expected to.  The enemy made them aware of their success by exploding a charge beneath the bore-holes, killing three of our men and injuring others.  From this, however, it was obvious that the main charge was not yet laid in the gallery.  Plans were therefore made at once for endeavouring to sap into the gallery from No Man's Land and blow it in, so as to cut it off at some distance from the crater, and thus, if possible, gain the crater end of it for our own use.  In order to begin the work far out in No Man's Land it was absolutely necessary to obtain some cover there, and cover of such a nature that the enemy should not recognise its purpose.  The problem might well have seemed an insurmountable one; but Major North, O.C. 1st Tunnelling Company, Canadian Engineers, solved it successfully, outwitting the Germans by an ingenious ruse. In the words of the Official Report:--\"One hundred pounds of ammonal were taken over the parapet, and, after a rather difficult reconnaissance, were placed about fifty feet in front of the new crater....  This charge was wired back to _Thames Street_.  In co-operation with the 5th Battalion, two 60-pound trench-mortars were fired at the German line in front at a prearranged time, and at one minute interval.  A minute later our charge was exploded, and after another minute another trench-mortar was fired, the object being to make the enemy believe that our charge was a trench-mortar fallen short.  This charge made a crater about 4 ft. deep and about 8 ft. in diameter, breaking the tough surface layer of roots and gravel.  We entered the crater immediately after it was blown, placed another charge of 200 pounds of ammonal, and blew it.  The next night we entered the crater, finding it about 8 ft. deep and about 25 ft. in diameter.\"  From this effective cover our boring went on unsuspected, and a number of charges were laid in different bore-holes close to where the gallery was judged to run.  When these were simultaneously exploded our calculations were proved correct.  A sector of the gallery was found completely wrecked, effectually cutting the communications, and we entered into possession of the undamaged portion, about 112 ft. in length, extending up into the new crater.  We thus secured a valuable post of vantage from which to conduct other mining operations, and the crater was consolidated into a strong point of considerable importance to our line.  By these and many similar small operations the enemy were kept at a tension and subjected to continual harassing annoyance; and our own men were encouraged and stimulated while perfecting themselves in the art of modern war.     CHAPTER III  ON THE SOMME  It is around the part played by the Canadian Forces in the gigantic and long-drawn-out struggle known as \"the Battle of the Somme\" that the interest of this third volume of our records must centre.  The operations which began, on July 1st, 1916, with the ponderous thrusts of the British and French Armies from before Albert and Bray, and ended with the capture of Bapaume and Peronne on March 17th and 18th, 1917, constituted, according to the nomenclature of war before these days of Armageddon, not one battle, indeed, but a campaign of many great battles.  In this war, however, all is on a scale so colossal that standards and terms of comparison have to be enlarged in due proportion.  All that unparalleled outpouring of agony and splendour, of sacrifice and endurance, of heroism and destruction, which the Germans have so poignantly--and significantly--designated as \"the blood-baths of the Somme,\" may be taken as one battle, a battle in whose vast rhythm the old values of hours and days are supplanted by weeks and months.  Yet never before in the world's history was there a battle in which minutes have been held so priceless, the seconds themselves so reckoned upon with meticulous precision.  To present an adequate picture of the battle as a whole, or even of the specific part played in it by this or that particular corps, is a task that will tax the powers of the inspired historian, viewing the great subject at such a distance that he can see it as a whole and in its true perspective. He will need to be a new Thucydides, equipped, not only with grasp and vision, but also with mastery of the magic of words.  And even so, the story will never be half told.  Men will continue digging into the records and unofficial accounts as an inexhaustible mine, forever discovering new jewels of wonder and terror and pity.  The utmost that can be attempted in this unpretending narrative is to set down the salient facts as to the achievements of our own Divisions, with such detail as can be sifted out, more or less at hazard, while the dust of the stupendous conflict is still in the air.  On September 1st the Canadians began to move from their sector of comparative calm toward the vortex of the gigantic struggle, which was at this period raging with special fury around Mouquet Farm and over the blood-soaked undulations between Pozières, Courcelette, and Martinpuich.  The quality of our troops, and the estimation in which they were held by the Higher Command, may be judged by the fact of their being allotted to this vital area, which included the key positions on the direct road to Bapaume.  How they justified this confidence, and at what a cost, the sequel will show.  The 1st Canadian Division, General Currie's veterans of Ypres, was the first to move south, and its headquarters were shifted to Rubempré, a few kilometres due west from shell-torn Albert.  On the 3rd we find certain battalions supporting the Australians at Tom's Cut; and by the 4th the whole division had moved up through Albert and out along the Bapaume road into the stress of the conflict, taking over from the 4th Australian Division under heavy shell-fire, a hotly-contested line of trenches running from a little behind Mouquet Farm to the junction of Munster Alley with Cameron and Highland trenches, about a mile to the south of Courcelette.  On the following day the headquarters of the Division were transferred from Rubempré to the precarious shelters and dug-outs of Tara Mill, on the Bapaume Road, near the grim collections of calcined rubble which had been La Boiselle and Ovillers.  On the 6th the 1st Canadian Divisional Artillery arrived, and took over from the 2nd Australian Divisional Artillery in support of General Currie's line.  All the time, from the moment of their arrival, our troops were kept under a very destructive bombardment from 5.9, 8-inch, and 11-inch guns, the enemy hoping thus to shake their morale before they could get settled into their new positions; and the communication trenches were so effectively blotted out that the front line could only be reached by going overland.  The relief was no more than satisfactorily completed when the war-worn old Division was given a chance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46116"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume III (#5)"],["body","show that its mettle had not deteriorated in the transfer from \"the Salient\" to the Somme.  In the early morning of the 8th an exposed section of our front trench, about seventy-five yards in extent, held by Lieutenant G. B. Murray, of the 14th Battalion, with Lieutenant B. L. Cook and twenty-four other ranks under his command, was attacked with the bayonet by some two hundred of the enemy, who succeeded at the first rush in forcing their way into the position.  The little party of defenders, however, held their ground with bomb, rifle, and cold steel till reinforcements came up, whereupon the assailants were expelled with heavy loss.  On the following day came the opportunity which the tried and seasoned Division was waiting for.  But it came to one Battalion only--the \"Fighting Second\" from Eastern Ontario, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel A. E. Swift, D.S.O.  At exactly twenty-five minutes past one in the afternoon of September 9th, the 2nd Battalion relieved the 4th along the sector of trench, on the right of the Canadian position, from which the attack was to be made.  Some 250 yards to the front, south-east of the Windmill on Bapaume Road and near the northern extension of the trench called Walker Avenue, was a blunt salient of German trench, 550 yards or so of it, which was strongly held and proving a thorn in our side.  It hung doggedly and defiantly athwart our plans for the advance on Courcelette, a mile away to the north.  It was this blunt salient that the \"Fighting Second\" had been appointed to bite off in order to clear the way for greater enterprises.  At a quarter to five precisely the first wave of our attack went over the parapet behind an intense barrage from all our guns.  The first three companies of the Battalion only were engaged in the attack, No. 4 Company being held in reserve close by, in Luxton Trench and Walker Avenue.  In spite of the punishment which the Germans had been receiving from our barrage, the assaulting wave encountered a sturdy resistance when it reached its objective, and for a few minutes the enemy trench was a pandemonium of savage hand-to-hand struggles with bomb and bayonet.  It was a reversion to the ancient form of individual fighting, when great issues so often hung upon the personal prowess of this or that one hero.  In this mad encounter individual heroism was too universal to admit of particularisation, but the exploit of Corporal Clarke lifts itself into prominence even in that splendid company.  Attacking with a squad of bombers on the extreme left of the wave, he jumped into the trench and found himself alone among a swarm of extremely lively and unsubdued Germans.  With the remainder of his bombs he cleared a way for himself. Then with his revolver he accounted for eighteen opponents, two of them being officers, and found himself undisputed master of two bays of the trench.  Even more splendid, perhaps, by reason of its self-sacrificing devotion, was the action of Lieutenant Pringle.  Leading his platoon against the centre of the enemy's line, he caught sight of a machine-gun hurriedly being mounted on the parapet in such a position that it would be able to wipe out his platoon.  Pushing forward at top speed through the storm of shell and bullets, he threw himself single-handed upon the gun-crew before they could get their deadly weapon into action.  It never came into action.  His men, following close behind, found his body sprawled across the muzzle of the gun, with the crew lying dead around him.  Along the rest of the sector the fighting fervour of our men was not to be denied, and the survivors of the enemy presently flung up their hands.  In just twenty-two minutes from the beginning of the assault the whole objective was in our hands, 138 prisoners had been gathered in, and the second, or consolidating, wave of the attack was settling itself to the task of making secure the captured position, reversing parapets and firing-step, and commencing new communication trenches back to the old line under the continuing shelter of our barrage.  In the meantime, the assaulting wave, taking their Lewis guns with them, moved on and occupied a strong line of shell-holes in front of the trench, while the bombing parties, in the face of desperate opposition, fought their way along the trench and established their blocks some sixty yards to either flank.  The price of this victory was two officers killed--Lieutenant Pringle and Lieutenant Stuart--and nine wounded, the wounds of three--Major Williams, Major A. E. McLaughlin, and Lieutenant Bishop--later proving fatal; and of other ranks 69 killed and 190 wounded.  In view of the narrow frontage involved in the attack and the small number of troops engaged, this operation must, of course, be classed as a minor one.  But by reason of its soundness of conception, the precision and completeness of its execution, and the importance of its bearing upon our enterprise against Courcelette a few days later, it takes rank with affairs of much greater magnitude and renown.  It reflects unbounded credit upon the commanding officer Colonel Swift, whose operation orders were remarkable for their clarity, foresight, and exactness of detail, and upon his second-in-command, Major Vanderwater, who led the attack and carried out those orders with such accuracy.  The Battalion was congratulated by General Plunier, the Army Commander, on the following day in terms of unusual commendation.  In the meantime, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions, following hard upon the heels of the 1st, had moved down from the north to Rubempré and La Plouy, close behind the battle area.  On the 11th Major-General Turner, V.C., C.B., D.S.O., commanding the 2nd Division, transferred his headquarters to Tara Hill, and assumed command of the sector which had been so ably controlled by General Currie since the 4th. Throughout the nights of the 10th and 11th the 2nd Division was occupied in relieving the 1st Division, the relief being carried out under extremely trying conditions and at the cost of a good many casualties; for not only the line to be relieved, but all the stripped and tortured waste behind it, was swept by an unceasing storm from the German gun positions across the Ancre and around Pys and Warlencourt. Our communication trenches in many places had been pounded out of existence and landmarks obliterated, with the consequence that some platoons went astray in the darkness and the bewildering uproar, and were hours late in reaching their allotted sectors of trench. Moreover, along with their shrapnel and high explosive, the enemy were sending over many gas and tear shells, which added greatly to the strain of the situation.  But the nerve of our Battalions refused to be shaken by this stern ordeal.  There was no going back, no wavering.  By the morning of the 12th the relief had been completed, and our lines were held by fresh units keen for the test which was already being prepared for them.  On this day the 1st Division went into rest camp at Rubempré, and the 3rd Division, under Major-General L. G. Lipsett, C.M.G., moved up to Usna Hill, their arrival being greeted that same night by a furious attack from the Germans at Mouquet Farm.  The brunt of this attack was borne by the 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles.  The assaulting waves were hurled back upon their entrenchments after heavy punishment by our machine-guns and Stokes trench-mortars.  And now we come to COURCELETTE--and write the name in capital letters, as it is one of the shining names in the story of Canadian valour.  The storming of that heap of ruins which had once been a sunny Picardian village nestling amid its orchards was an achievement which must make its day--September 15th, 1916--for ever memorable in Canadian history. Of course, as the men who fought and won at Courcelette would be the first to protest, the action, splendid as it was, does not stand in the same category with the Second Battle of Ypres.  It is necessary, in writing of it, not to let one's sense of proportion be obscured by its brilliancy and completeness.  In the final analysis it will show as a great operation perfectly planned, and executed with a courage, swiftness, and thoroughness calling for the highest praise.  Even so, it constitutes but a single stride in the great advance known as the Battle of the Somme.  Had it failed, the result would not have been disaster to the Somme operations as a whole, but merely a costly, and perhaps depressing, postponement.  The Second Battle of Ypres, on the other hand, belongs not to Canada and the Empire alone, but to the world.  It must rank among those few outstanding achievements of uncalculated and self-sacrificing heroism which serve as an incentive to noble spirits for all time.  There was that of the miraculous about it which startles and grips the imagination.  There was that mingling of high tragedy and terror and devotion which purges national pride to the purest patriotism.  It tore victory--men hardly know how to this day--from the jaws of overwhelming and seemingly inevitable defeat; and had it failed, who can set a limit to the catastrophe that might well have followed?  Finally, at the Second Battle of Ypres a young nation came suddenly to full manhood through a well-nigh unparalleled initiation of blood and splendour and tears.  It is right that the name of YPRES should stand apart, and its imperishable glory not be infringed upon when allotting their meed of praise to other notable operations of the Canadian Forces.  The capture of Courcelette was the pre-eminent achievement of the Canadians during the year 1916.  The glory of it belongs to the 2nd Canadian Division, which, under happy augury, fought the battle on the anniversary of its arrival in France.  The Division was highly trained and well seasoned to war by a year of strenuous duty in the tormented area of \"the Salient.\"  It had learned all the lessons of endurance and defence"]]]
