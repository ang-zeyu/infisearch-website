He had not received the papers, and had had an unintelligible wordy duel in which he had been vanquished. He was boiling with rage.  \"If I had my way,\" he stormed, \"there would be only _one_ language in the world!\"  We were off once more.  We had but a faint idea of where we were going, but we were on our way.                                   *CHAPTER VI*   When we awoke the sun was high in the heavens, and through the train windows we could see the steep banks of the Seine as we wound along that picturesque river toward Rouen.  From time to time we passed small villages, the red tile of their roofs contrasting prettily with the snow-white of the walls. Some houses were decorated with bright blue or green, and as they swept by the window in kaleidoscopic array, the scene was one of manifold variety.  The French love a dash of colour; it is manifest everywhere—in their clothes, their houses and their military uniforms.  In the larger cities where civilisation is over-developed, and humanity is more effete, the bright colours have given place to pale and delicate shades—an indication of that transformation of life which we call art.  But in these little country villages, a thousand years or more behind the times, Dame Nature still holds sway, and the primary colours riot in their rugged strength. Centuries from now these rural hamlets, grown to greater size, losing their primitive audacity, will fade as well; and looking back will marvel at the boldness of their youth.  Every quarter-mile along the track a lone sentinel, in sky-blue coat and scarlet cap, guarded our path.  With fixed _baionette_ he stood hour by hour, watchful and keen.  He had a little thatched sentry-box into which he might retire when it rained, and through the small round windows watch on either side.  As we pulled into the railway station at Rouen, we could see resourceful \"Tommy\" cooking his breakfast on a little charcoal stove. \"Tommy\" is always at home, no matter where we find him—whether it be on the battlefields of France or Belgium, or on the rock-bound shores of Gallipoli.  Our men descended from their coaches, lugged out their bags of bread, their cheese and jam and \"bully-beef.\"  The sergeant-cook meted out each share, and they soon were at their morning meal.  A few hours later Reggy and I were seated at luncheon in the _Hotel de la Poste_.  The _salle a manger_ was filled with English, French and Belgian officers, and their wives or friends, and to the casual observer the place was as gay as in times of peace.  But in spite of the bright colours of the uniforms, in spite of the \"chic\" Parisian hats and pretty faces of the ladies, one felt over all an atmosphere subdued and serious.  It is true wine sparkled upon almost every table, but in France this doesn’t necessarily mean gaiety.  Every Frenchman drinks wine, but it is very rare indeed to see one drunk. Wine, like water at home, is used as a beverage—not as an intoxicant.  Imbued with the spirit of the time and place, Reggy and I called for a bottle of old _Chambertin_, and under its mellowing influence, care and the war were soon forgotten.  Of course we visited the Cathedral, and listened to the old sexton pouring incomprehensible data into our stupid ears for half an hour while we examined the rare stained windows and the carved oak door. When we returned to the train, the senior major and the transport officer were deep in conversation: \"But where are your papers?\" the R.T.O. was asking.  \"We haven’t any,\" the major replied. \"That French conductor wouldn’t hold the train until they arrived.  Can’t we go on without them?\"  \"Where are you going?\"  \"We presume to Boulogne—the rest of the unit is there, but we have no orders.  When does the train leave, please?\"  \"There’ll be one at 3 p.m., and if you wish to take that, get your men aboard.\"  We might have been touring France—he was so nonchalant, and there was such an absence of \"red-tape.\"  Imagine in these hyper-martial days being told to \"take the 3 p.m. train if we wished!\"  Nowadays it is not a matter of volition; units go where and when they are commanded, and a definite system has replaced haphazard.  But the old way had its good points—it still let one believe he was in part his own master.  Having a sense of duty and, moreover, being anxious to reach our destination—wherever that might be—we entrained once more and travelled all the balance of that day and night.  Promptly at 3 p.m. Reggy fell asleep, and didn’t wake once, not even to eat, until the following morning at six o’clock, when with a crash he was thrown off his couch to the floor of the train.  Thus rudely startled, but not quite wide awake, he ejaculated:  \"Torpedoed, by Gad!\"  We didn’t take time to wake Reggy and explain the situation, but sprang to our feet and threw open the door of the train.  What had happened? We were at Boulogne; our train had collided with another in the railway yards, but fortunately only one coach was crushed and no one hurt.  We descended to the tracks and found other coaches on other trains in a similar condition.  It was not difficult to understand the cause. The German spy leaves nothing undone, and was very careful to attend to such details as changing the railway switches to the wrong tracks.  By now the spies have been almost completely weeded out; but in those days they were very active.  How thorough was their system was well illustrated when, later on, the Western Cavalry entered the trenches.  A wooden horse rose instantly above the German trench, bearing this legend: \"Western Cavalry, come over and get your horses!\"  Our boys promptly shot the offending animal full of holes.  It fell; but in a moment was raised again with bandages about its neck and leg!  Despite the early morning hour, in a railway car a few yards from us, several young Englishwomen were busy serving hot cocoa and rolls to the hungry soldiers.  The interior of the coach had been transformed into a kitchen and travelling buffet.  Every man in uniform was welcome to enter and partake free of charge.  We took advantage of this practical hospitality and, much refreshed, returned to our own train.  At another platform a regiment of Ghurkas were engaged loading their equipment.  One came across to our engine and drawing some hot water from the boiler, washed his teeth and mouth with infinite care.  The Ghurka is so like the Jap in appearance that when, later, we saw a body of these brave little chaps, with their turned-up Stetson hats, marching along the street, for a moment we actually mistook them for our Oriental allies. It was only when we observed their short broad swords (kukris) that we realised it could be none other than these famous men from India.  The colonel was at the station to meet us. How glad we were to see his genial face once more!  \"Your billets are all arranged,\" he said. \"The officers will stay at the _Louvre_ and the non-commissioned officers and men at the _Jean d’arc_ theâtre.\"  The men were lined-up and, now that the unit was once more complete, formed quite an imposing sight.  In those days medical units wore the red shoulder straps; the privilege of retaining these coloured straps has been granted only to members of the First Contingent.  The men marched across _Le Pont Marguet_, up the main thoroughfare, along the _Rue Victor Hugo_, crossing the market place, and in a narrow street not far from the market found the little theâtre.  It made a perfect billet, the main hall serving as a mess room, and the gallery as an excellent dormitory.  The quartermaster, Reggy, and I were billeted in one large room at the _Louvre_.  Our window overlooked the basin and across the quay we could see the fish-wives unloading the herring boats as they arrived in dozens.  With their queer wooden shoes (sabots) they clack-clacked across the cobblestones; their large baskets, overflowing with fish, strapped to their backs.  Among all the varied odours of that odorous city, that of fish rises supreme.  It saluted our nostrils when we marched in the streets, and was wafted in at our windows when the thoughtless breeze ventured our way.  We could see too, the Channel boats arriving at the dock, bringing battalion after battalion of troops.  These rapidly entrained, and were whisked away in the shrill-whistling little French trains toward the battlefront.  Sometimes convoys of London ’busses, now bereft of their advertisements and painted dull grey, filled with \"Tommies\" destined for the \"big show,\" passed by the door and rolled away into the far beyond.  The second morning of our stay at Boulogne Reggy awoke feeling that he really must have a bath.  Why he should consider himself different from all the other people in France, is a matter I am not prepared to discuss.  A bath, in France, is a luxury, so to speak, and is indulged in at infrequent intervals—on fête days or some other such auspicious occasion.  He rang the bell to summon the maid.  In a few moments a tousled blonde head-of-hair, surmounted by a scrap of old lace, was thrust inside the door.  \"_Monsieur?_\" it enquired.  Reggy prided himself upon his French—he had taken a high place in college in this particular subject, but, as he remarked deprecatingly, his French seemed a bit too refined for the lower classes, who couldn’t grasp its subtleties.  \"_Je veux un bain_,\" he said.  He was startled by the ease with which she understood.  Could it be that he looked—but, no, he appeared as clean as the rest of us.  At any rate, she responded at once in French:  \"_Oui, monsieur_.  I’ll bring it in to you.\"  She withdrew her head and closed the door.  \"What the deuce,\" cried Reggy, as he sat up quickly in bed.  \"She’ll _bring in_ the bath! Does she take me for a canary?\"  \"A canary doesn’t make such a dickens of a row as you do,\" growled the quartermaster, \"looking for a bath at six a.m.\"  I tried to console him by reminding him that it was much better to have Reggy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46300"],["title","The First Canadians in France (#8)"],["body","and clean than in his present state, but he said it made small difference to him as he had a cold in his head anyway.  Reggy, as an interested third party, began to look upon our controversy as somewhat personal, and was about to interfere when a rap at the door cut short further argument.  Two chambermaids entered the room, carrying between them a tin pan about two feet in diameter and six inches in depth.  It contained about a gallon of hot water.  They placed it beside his bed.  \"_Voici, monsieur!_\" cried she of the golden locks.  Reggy leaned over the side of the bed and looked down at it.  \"_Sacré sabre de bois;_\" he exclaimed.  \"It isn’t a drink I want—it’s a bath—’bain’—to wash—’laver’ ye know!\"  He made motions with his hands in excellent imitation of a gentleman performing his morning ablutions.  They nodded approvingly, and laughed:  \"_Oui, monsieur_—it _is_ the bath.\"  \"Well, I’ll be d——\"  But before Reggy could conclude the two maids had smilingly withdrawn.  Reggy explored the room in his pyjamas and emptied our three water pitchers into the pan.  \"Now I’ll at least be able to get my feet wet,\" he grumbled.  \"Where’s the soap?\" he exclaimed a moment later.  \"There isn’t a bally cake of soap in the room.\"  It was true.  This is one of the petty annoyances of French hotels. Soap is never in the room and must be purchased as an extra, always at the most inopportune moment.  After half an hour’s delay Reggy succeeded in buying a cake from the porter, and his bath proceeded without further mishap.  He then tumbled into bed again and fell asleep.  The maids shortly returned to carry out the bath, but when they saw how Reggy had exhausted all the water in the room they held up their hands in undisguised astonishment.  \"Monsieur is extravagant,\" they exclaimed, \"to waste so much water!\" Fortunately \"Monsieur\" was fast asleep, so the remark passed unnoticed.  Later we approached the _concierge_, and asked here if there were not a proper bath-tub in the place.  She laughed.  _Les Anglais_ were so much like ducks—they wanted to be _always_ in the water.  \"But I will soon have it well for you,\" she declaimed with pride.  \"I am having two bath tubs placed in the cellar, and then you may play in the water all the day.\"  At the time we looked upon this as her little joke, but when, weeks later, one early morning we noticed a tall _Anglais_ walking through the hotel \"lounge\" in his pyjamas, with bath towel thrown across his arm, we realised that she had spoken truth.  The bath tubs were really and truly in the cellar.  It was ten days before we succeeded in locating the building which we wanted for our hospital.  All the suitable places in Boulogne were long since commandeered.  Every large building, including all the best hotels, had been turned into hospitals, so that we were forced to go far afield.  Finally, twenty-two miles from the city, we found a summer hotel exactly suited to our needs.  It was in a pine forest, and close to the sea shore, an ideal spot for a hospital.  During these ten days the talent of our corps conceived the idea of holding a concert in the _Jean d’arc_ hall.  At this time all theatres, music halls, and even \"movies\" in France were closed, and music was tabooed.  France was taking the war seriously. She was mourning her dead and the loss of her lands.  The sword had been thrust deeply into her bosom, and the wound was by no means healed.  The streets were filled with widows, and their long black veils symbolised the depth of the nation’s grief.  Let those who will admire the light-heartedness of Britain—Britain wears no mourning for her heroes dead.  In Britain it is _bourgeois_ to be despondent.  We keep up an appearance of gaiety even when our hearts are heaviest.  But France is too natural, too frank for such deception. What she feels, she shows upon the surface.  At first our apparent indifference to our losses and hers was a source of irritation.  France resented it; but now she knows us better.  We are not indifferent—it is merely an attitude.  The two nations now understand one another, and in that understanding lies the foundation of a firmer friendship.  With success and confidence in the future, France has risen out of the \"slough of despond.\"  She has recovered a portion of her old-time light-heartedness.  We thought her effervescent, artificial and unstable; we have found her steadfast, true and unshakable.  She has manifested throughout this desperate struggle a grim and immutable determination that has been the marvel of her allies and the despair of her enemies.  Realising the temporary distaste for amusement in France, our little concert was intended to be private and confined solely to our own unit. But a few of the new-found French friends of the boys waived their objections to entertainment, and as a special favour volunteered to come.  It was a strange and moving sight to see a Canadian audience in that far-off land, gravely seated in their chairs in the little hall, waiting for the curtain to rise.  Our staff of Nursing Sisters honoured the boys with their presence, and every officer and man was there.  Thirty or forty of the native population, in black, a little doubtful of the propriety of their action, were scattered through the khaki-clad.  The boys outdid themselves that night.  How well they sang those songs of home!  We were carried back thousands of miles across the deep to our dear old Canada, and many an eye was wet with tears which dare not fall.  But reminiscence fled when Sergeant Honk assumed the stage.  Some one had told Honk he could sing, and—subtle flatterer—he had been believed. With the first wild squeaky note we were back, pell-mell in France.  The notes rose and fell—but mostly fell; stumbling over and over one another in their vain endeavour to escape from Honk.  Some maintained he sang by ear.  Perhaps he did—he didn’t sing by mouth and chords long lost to human ken came whistling through his nose. The song was sad—but we laughed and laughed until we wept again.  [Illustration: THE SONG WAS SAD—BUT WE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED UNTIL WE WEPT AGAIN]  At the end of the first verse he seemed a little bewildered by the effect, but he had no advantage over us in that respect.  At the end of the second verse, seeing his hearers in danger of apoplexy, he hesitated, and turning to Taylor, the pianist, muttered in an aside:  \"They downt understand h’English, them bloakes—this ayn’t a funny song—blimed if I downt quit right ’ere, and serve ’em jolly well right too!\"  And under a perfect storm of applause and cries of protest, Honk departed as he had come—anglewise.  Tim and his brother then had a boxing-bout; and Cameron, who acted as Tim’s second, drew shrieks of joy from his French admirers, between rounds, as he filled his mouth with water and blew it like a penny shower into the perspiring breathless face of Tim.  \"A wee drap watter refraishes ye, Tim,\" he declared argumentatively after one of these showers.  \"Doze Pea-jammers tinks it’s funny,\" Tim puffed.  \"Let dem have a good time—dey ain’t see’d nuthin’ much lately—-an’ a good laff ’ull help dem digest dere ’patty de frog-grass!\"                                  *CHAPTER VII*   It was my fate, or fortune, to be in charge of the advance party which was detailed to prepare for the opening of our hospital.  Captain Burnham and I, with about forty N.C.O.s and men, and with two days’ rations, left Boulogne one cold November afternoon, a few days after the concert.  After a slow train journey of three hours’ duration, we were deposited at the railway station of a fishing village on the coast.  If Boulogne prides itself on its odour of dead fish, this little place must be an everlasting thorn in its side; for all the smells of that maladorous city fade into insignificance before the concentrated \"incense\" of the back streets of Etaples.  We didn’t linger unnecessarily in the village, but pushed on at the \"quick-march\" and, crossing the bridge, were soon on the broad paved road which runs through _Le Touquet_ forest.  It was just dusk, and snow had fallen to the depth of about two inches; the most we saw in two winters during our stay in that part of France. It was a crisp, cold evening, and the swinging pace of our march did much to keep us warm.  From time to time we passed large summer residences and artistic villas partly hidden in the woods, but all the doors were closed, and all the windows were dark.  Not a human being passed us on the road, and the noise of our shoes crunching through the crusted snow was the only sound which broke the solemn stillness of the air.  Our men too seemed oppressed with the weird solitude of the forest and seldom spoke above a whisper.  \"Seems as though the world were dead,\" said Burnham, after we had walked nearly two miles in silence.  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it gives one a creepy feeling passing through this long dark avenue of pines.  The houses too look as if the inhabitants had fled and that no one had the courage to return.\"  \"I understand the _Bosches_ were through quite close to here,\" Burnham remarked, \"in their first mad dash for Paris, and that some German soldiers were killed near the outskirts of this wood.\"  \"By the gruesomeness of it I can imagine they were _all_ killed,\" I replied.  By this time we had turned at right angles to our former path and entered another long avenue of trees.  The white walls of an isolated mansion stood out in the distance against the black-green of the forest and the fading purple of the evening sky.  The grounds about it were enclosed by a high pointed iron fence; it looked a veritable prison.  After tramping another mile we emerged into an open space between the trees and the rolling sand dunes of the coast, and saw before us a large limestone building, three stories in height and almost surrounded with broad, glass-enclosed balconies.  The tracks of a disused tramway ran to the gate, and the rust upon the rails spoke more"]]]
