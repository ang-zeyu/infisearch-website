And again, let the Bishop appoint a storehouse unto this Church, and let all things, both in money and in meat, which is more than is needful for the want of this people, be kept in the hands of the Bishop. And let him also reserve unto himself for his own wants, and for the wants of his family, as he shall be employed in doing this business. And thus I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves according to my laws; and I consecrate unto them this land for a little season, until I, the Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence; and the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act upon this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good. Behold this shall be an example unto my servant Edward Partridge, in other places, in all Churches.\"--Sec. 51, pars. 4, 10-18, pp. 203, 204.  First.--From the above we find that bishops were first spoken of as early as April, 1830. (See sec. 20, p. 121.)  Second.--Certain men were to be appointed to look after the poor and administer to their relief and govern the affairs of the property of the Church. (See sec. 38, pars. 34-36, p. 163, January 2, 1831.)  Third.--Edward Partridge was called to be the first Bishop, (See sec. 41, par. 9, p. 168, February 1831,) \"and to spend all his time in the labors of the Church.\"  Fourth.--That Newel K. Whitney was called and appointed to this office as the second Bishop of this Church.  Fifth.--After this, besides Bishops' agents, there were other Bishops appointed. George Miller was appointed to the Bishopric, and had it sealed upon his head.  \"I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a Bishopric, like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me.\"--Sec. 124, par. 21, p. 431.  Also, \"He who is appointed to administer spiritual things, the same is worthy of his hire, even as those who are appointed to a stewardship to administer in temporal things.\"--Sec. 70, par. 12, p. 254.  There seems to be a difference in the duties of Bishops; Brother Miller's was to be like Edward Partridge's whose duties are distinctly marked out as follows: \"And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him.\"--Sec. 124, par. 20 (see also par. 21), p. 431.  At the same time and in the same manner Vinson Knight, Samuel H. Smith, and Shadrach Roundy were appointed to preside over the Bishopric.  \"And again, I say unto you, I give unto you Vinson Knight, Samuel H. Smith, and Shadrach Roundy, if he will receive it, to preside over the Bishopric; a knowledge of said Bishopric is given unto you in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.\"--Sec. 124, par. 141, p. 446. Vinson Knight was a Bishop, the two others were of course his Counselors.  We find from the foregoing and from what follows that there were several kinds of Bishops, as well as Bishops' agents. Bishop Edward Partridge was appointed to preside over the Saints in Zion, to purchase lands, divide inheritances, and sit as a judge in Israel, as a general Bishop to that district of country, and he had a special agent to assist him, viz., Sidney Gilbert.  Bishop Whitney was appointed Bishop in Kirtland, Ohio, yet he had charge of all the Churches in the eastern country, as a general Bishop. Neither of these, at that time, were presiding Bishops over the Bishopric. George Miller was appointed to fill the place of Edward Partridge and officiate in the same order of Bishopric. Vinson Knight was appointed to preside over the Bishopric with Samuel H. Smith and Shadrach Roundy for counselors, and at the same time that George Miller was appointed to take the place of Edward Partridge. Then there were Alanson Ripley and others. Sidney Gilbert was to be an agent unto this Church in the place that shall be appointed by the Bishop. (Sec 53, par. 4, p. 209.)  \"And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the office which I have appointed him, to receive moneys, to be an agent unto the Church, to buy land in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be in righteousness, and as wisdom shall direct. * * And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Sidney Gilbert plant himself in this place, and establish a store, that he may sell goods _without fraud_ that he may obtain money to buy lands for the good of the Saints, and that he may obtain whatsoever things the disciples may need to plant them in their inheritances.\"--Sec. 57, pars. 6, 8, pp. 215-16.  The Lord says Edward Partridge was also to \"stand in the office which I have appointed him, to divide the Saints their inheritance, even as I have commanded; and also those whom he has appointed to assist him.\"--Sec. 57, par. 7, p. 215 * * \"Let the Bishop and the agent make preparations for those families which have been commanded to come to this land, as soon as possible, and plant them in their inheritance.\"--Sec.57, par, 15, p. 216. \"I have selected my servant Edward Partridge, and have appointed unto him his mission in this land; but if he repent not of his sins, which are unbelief and blindness of heart, let him take heed lest he fall. Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again. And whoso standeth in his mission is appointed to be a judge in Israel, like as it was in ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of God unto his children, and to judge his people by the testimony of the just, and by the assistance of his counselors, according to the laws of the kingdom which are given by the Prophets of God; for verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land. Let no man think he is ruler, but let God rule him that judgeth, according to the counsel of his own will; or, in other words him that counseleth or sitteth upon the judgment seat.\"--Sec. 5 8 pars. 14-20, p. 218. \"Let the residue of the Elders * * hold a conference;\" and Edward Partridge was empowered to direct the conference which should be held by certain Elders. (Sec. 58, pars. 61, 62, p. 222.)  \"And let my servant Edward Partridge impart of the money which I have given him, a portion unto mine Elders who are commanded to return.\"--Sec. 60, pars. 10, 11, p. 226. If not able, they were not required to return it.  \"Let my servant Newel K. Whitney retain his store, or in other words, the store yet for a little season. Nevertheless let him impart all the money which he can impart, to be sent up unto the land of Zion. Behold these things are in his own hands, let him do according to wisdom. Verily I say, let him be ordained as an agent unto the disciples that shall tarry, and let him be ordained unto this power.\"--Sec. 43, pars. 42-45, pp. 236-7. It would seem from the above that Bishop Whitney was not yet a Bishop when he was ordained to be an agent.  \"And even the Bishop, who is a judge, and his Counselors, if they are not faithful in their stewardships, shall be condemned, and others shall be planted in their stead.\" Sec. 64, par. 40, p. 243.  We find from the following that Bishops must be selected from the High Priests and be set apart to the Bishopric.  \"There remaineth hereafter, in the due time of the Lord, other Bishops to be set apart unto the Church, to minister even according to the first; wherefore they shall be High Priests who are worthy, and they shall be appointed by the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they be literal descendants of Aaron. And if they be literal descendants of Aaron, they have a legal right to the Bishopric, if they are the first born among the sons of Aaron; for the firstborn hold the right of the _Presidency_ over this Priesthood, and the _keys_ or authority of the same. No man has a legal right to this office to hold the _keys_ of this Priesthood, except he be a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron; but as a High Priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of Bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called, and set apart and ordained unto this power under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood. And a literal descendant of Aaron, also, must be designated by this Presidency, and found worthy, and anointed, and ordained under the hands of this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their Priesthood; but by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the Priesthood descending from father to son, they may claim their anointing, if at any time they can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the hands of the above named Presidency. And again, no Bishop or High Priest who shall be set apart for this ministry, shall be tried or condemned for any crime, save it be before the First Presidency of the Church; and inasmuch as he is found guilty before this Presidency, by testimony that cannot be impeached, he shall be condemned.\"--Sec. 68, pars. 14-23, pp. 249-250.  We may here notice, as elsewhere referred to, that it is the Presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood that is above spoken of, that must be set apart by the First Presidency, and also tried by them, whether of lineal descent or High Priests. Newel K. Whitney was appointed and ordained a Bishop. (See sec. 72, par. 8, p. 257) \"Let my servant Newel K. Whitney, and my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., and my servant Sidney Rigdon, sit in council with the Saints which are in Zion.\"--Sec. 78, par. 9, p. 281. Thus it seems that though Bishop Whitney"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46221"],["title","Items on the Priesthood, presented to the Latter-day Saints (#5)"],["body","Bishop of Kirtland, he sat in council with the Saints which were in Zion, associated with Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, thus showing that he was not a ward but a general Church Bishop.  \"Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servant Alam, and Ahashdah, (Newel K. Whitney,) Mahalaleel, and Pelagoram, (Sidney Rigdon,) and my servant Gazelam, (Joseph Smith,) and Horah, Olihah, (Oliver Cowdery,) and Shalemanasseh, and Mehemson, (Martin Harris,) to be bound together by a bond and covenant that cannot be broken by transgression, (_except judgment shall_ immediately follow,) in your several stewardships, _to manage the affairs of the poor, and all things pertaining to the Bishopric_, both in the land of Zion and in the land of Shinehah (Kirtland.)\"--Sec. 82, pars. 11, 12, p. 286.  This proves that President Joseph Smith and his Counselor Sidney Rigdon were authorized to supervise temporal matters in the Church as well as the Bishop or with him. Here the Melchizedek Priesthood is united with the Aaronic to manage the Bishopric in both lands. We continue our quotations: \"Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.\"--Sec. 82, par. 19, p. 287.  \"Which Abraham received the Priesthood from Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah; and from Noah till Enoch, through the lineage of their fathers; and from Enoch to Abel, who was slain by the conspiracy of his brother, who received the Priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his father Adam, who was the first man--which Priesthood continueth in the Church of God in all generations, and is without beginning of days or end of years. And the Lord confirmed a Priesthood also upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations--which Priesthood also continueth and abideth forever with the Priesthood, which is after the holiest order of God. And this greater Priesthood administereth the Gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the Kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God; therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of Godliness is manifest, and without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the Priesthood, the power of Godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh; for without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live. Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God; but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence, therefore the Lord in his wrath (for his anger was kindled against them) swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness; which rest is the fullness of his glory. Therefore he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also.\"--Sec. 84, pars. 14-25, pp. 290-1.  We have already shown that there was a Priesthood conferred upon Aaron and his seed throughout all their generations. It becomes a question what Priesthood Aaron had before he had bestowed upon him what is termed the Aaronic Priesthood, when he administered with Moses? \"The greater Priesthood administereth the Gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the Kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.\"  Frederick G. Williams was called and appointed a High Priest and Counselor to Joseph Smith. His call reads as follows:  \"Verily, verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a High Priest in my Church and a Counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., unto whom I have given the keys of the Kingdom, _which belongeth always unto the Presidency of the High Priesthood_: therefore, verily, I acknowledge him and will bless him and also thee, inasmuch as thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed unto you in prayer always vocally and in thy heart, in public and in private, also in thy ministry in proclaiming the Gospel in the land of the living, and among thy brethren.\"--Sec. 81, pars. 1-3, p. 284.  From the following we find that God took Moses from the midst of the children of Israel and also the Holy or Melchizedek Priesthood, leaving the lesser, or the Aaronic Priesthood. \"Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also; and the lesser Priesthood continued, which Priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory Gospel, which Gospel is the Gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath, caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb; for he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to prepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power. And again, the _offices of Elder and Bishop_ are necessary appendages belonging unto the High Priesthood.\" Sec. 84, pars. 25-29, p. 291. From this, it would seem that the law of carnal commandments was a curse. Paul said the law was added because of transgression. (\"It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\" Gal. iii, 19.) And that it was a yoke which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear; and that Christ came to fulfill the law and introduce the Gospel which was greater--a higher law and a greater Priesthood, viz: the Melchizedek.  Both Elders and Bishops are appendages to the High Priesthood. \"And again, the offices of Teacher and Deacon are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser Priesthood.\" (Sec. 84, par. 30, p. 291); thus Elders and Bishops are appendages to the High Priesthood, while Teachers and Deacons are appendages to the lesser, which lesser is an appendage to the higher or Melchizedek. \"Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of Moses--for the sons of Moses, and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed.\"--Sec. 84, par. 31, p. 291. When both of these Priesthoods are carried out and united in their purity, the glory of the Lord will be manifested upon Mount Zion, in the Lord's house, both operating according to their callings, position and authority. For it is written, \"And the sons of Moses and Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion, in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my Church; for whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two Priesthoods, of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies; they become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the Church and Kingdom, and the elect of God; and also all they who receive this Priesthood receiveth me, saith the Lord; for he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; and he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's Kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him; and this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the Priesthood. Therefore, all those who receive the Priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father which he cannot break, neither can it be moved; but whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come. And all those who come not unto this Priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens, and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.\"--Sec. 84, pars. 32-42, p. 292.  \"And let all those who have not families, who receive moneys, send it up unto the Bishop in Zion, or unto the Bishop in Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion.\"--Sec. 84, par. 104, p. 298.  In the same revelation \"unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and six Elders,\" it is written: \"Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser Priesthood, and send them before you to make appointments, and prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill. Behold, this is the way that mine Apostles, in ancient days, built up my Church unto me.[A] Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect.\"--Sec. 84, pars. 107, 108, no, p. 299.  [Footnote A: Why should not this be the way now?]  We further quote: \"For the body is not one member, but many. * * And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.\"--I Cor. xii, 14, 21.  \"And the Bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also, should travel round about and among all the Churches, searching after the poor to administer to their wants by humbling the rich and the proud; he should also employ an agent to take charge and to do his secular business as he shall direct.\"--Sec. 84, pars. 112, 113, p. 299. Thus High Priests, Seventies, Elders, Bishops, and all men holding the Priesthood were to be actively engaged in magnifying their Priesthood.  \"It is the duty of the Lord's clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history, and a General Church Record of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from the Bishop; and also "]]]
