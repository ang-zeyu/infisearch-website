Sinitor Hanna was prisint walkin' with a stick.  Th' prisidint approached him gaily an' asked him about his leg.  \"'Tis gettin' betther,\" says th' sinitor.  \"That's good,\" says th' prisidint.  \"Come again whin it is entirely well an' we'll talk over that appointment,\" he says.  Th' afthernoon was enlivened be th' appearance iv a Southern Congressman askin' f'r a foorth-class post-office.  Th' prisidint hardly missed him be more thin a foot at th' gate, but th' Congressman bein' formerly wan iv Mosby's guerillas escaped, to th' gr-reat chagrin iv Mr. Rosenfelt, who remarked on his return that life at th' White House was very confinin'.  \"I will niver be able to enfoorce th' civil sarvice law till I take more exercise,\" he said heartily.  Th' ambulance was at th' dure promptly at five, but no important business havin' been thransacted nearly all th' cabinet was able to walk to their homes.'  \"Yes, sir, 'twill be grand an' I'm goin' to injye it.  F'r th' first time since I've been at it, Ar-rchey road methods has been inthrajooced in naytional polliticks.  I knew th' time wud come, Hinnissy.  'Tis th' on'y way.  Ye may talk about it as much as ye want, but govermint, me boy, is a case iv me makin' ye do what I want an' if I can't do it with a song, I'll do it with a shovel. Th' ir'n hand in th' velvet glove, th' horseshoe in th' boxin' mit, th' quick right, an' th' heavy boot, that was th' way we r-run polliticks when I was captain iv me precinct.\"  \"But ye niver was prisidint,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"I always had too soft a spot f'r age,\" said Mr. Dooley; \"an' 'tis th' aged that does up us young fellows.  An' annyhow I done betther.\"     Money and Matrimony   \"Can a man marry on twinty-five dollars?\" asked Mr. Dooley.  \"He can if he can get th' money,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Dooley; \"here's a judge on th' binch says twinty-five dollars is as much as a man needs to enther th' sacred bonds--twinty-five dollars beside th' nerve, an' he has to have that annyhow.  Th' pa-apers has took it up an' some is f'r it an' some is again' it.  A few iditors believes it can be done on less; others thinks it can't be done undher thirty at th' outside.  A larned lawyer says that a man who wud lure a young girl away fr'm her music lessons whin if she asked him f'r twinty-six dollars he'd have to signal f'r help, is nawthin' short iv a crim'nal. Nearly all th' ladin' acthresses in th' counthry has been interviewed an' they say that if marrid at all they cud not see their way clear f'r less thin a millyion iv money.  They think th' judge meant a divoorce.  Lookin' over th' argymints pro an' con, Hinnissy, I come to th' conclusion that th' judge is wrong an' times has changed.  \"Whin I was a boy all a man needed was a little encouragement fr'm th' fam'ly, an account with a liveryman an' a small pull with th' parish priest an' there he was.  'Twas well if he had a job too but if he hadn't it wasn't a bar.  A marrid man can always find wurruk to do.  He's got to.  But no wan iver thought iv askin' him to skin open his bank book.  They wasn't anny such things.  They wasn't anny banks.  He didn't have to pin a cashier's check to th' proposal an' put in a sealed bid.  If th' girls in my time an' this part iv town had to wait f'r an opulent business man with twinty-five or thirty dollars, manny iv thim wud be waitin' at this minyit.  \"We looked on mathrimony as a dhraft on posterity, as Mark Hanna wud say, an' not as an invistmint.  We argyied that while th' childher was growin' up we'd be undher no expinse, an' when they'd finished their schoolin' an' was able to take up th' stern jooties iv life an' go to wurruk, say between th' age iv sivin an' nine, they cud support us in luxury.  Th' young ladies had none th' best iv us.  They had no money too, along with th' rest iv their charms. It was no case iv matchin' coopons in thim happy days.  Th' father iv th' fam'ly niver thought iv sindin' in an expert accountant to look over th' young man's books an' decide whether his invistmints was sound, an' if th' young man had th' nerve to ask his father-in-law was he still on th' payroll, 'twudn't be the sacramint iv mathrimony he'd require.  If th' young man was kind to th' dog, smoked seegars that were not made be th' rubber thrust an' cud pass ivry second saloon without a pang, he was illegible f'r to enther th' first fam'lies in th' neighborhood an' sometimes even th' last.  We was too dilicate f'r to speak iv marredge as though it was like buyin' a pound iv tinpinny nails.  Durin' th' coortship no wan around th' house iver let on that annything was in th' air, though wanst in awhile they was a giggle whin th' dure bell rang an' th' ol' man wud give a wink to th' clock an' go out into th' kitchen.  We spint most iv our time in th' kitchen while th' preliminaries was bein' arranged.  Th' coortship I think wint on be a complete system iv signals long befure Marconi come into th' wurruld, but wan night th' wealthy heiress come hack fr'm th' parlor an' fell into a clinch with her mother, an' th' proud father yawned an' wint to bed.  That was all they was to it.  No wan assayed young Lotharyo Hinnissy iv th' sixth ward.  If they heard he had twinty-five dollars, they'd begin f'r to make an allybi ready f'r him.  I mind whin Hogan was goin' to marry Cassidy's daughter.  'I haven't a cint,' he says.  'Hurry up an' marry thin,' says Cassidy, 'or ye might have.'  \"That's th' way it was in thim good ol' days an', be hivins, I think that's th' way it is now among th' likes iv us.  An' that's a good thing f'r th' men that own th' rollin' mills.  It wudden't do to take anny chances goin' up an' down Ar-rchey road offerin' ye'ersilf without th' cash forfeit.  Some wan might call ye.  But it's diff'rent among th' best fam'lies.  'Tis far diff'rent.  I read be th' pa-apers in this conthrovarsy, that if a man can't show down a bank account that wud make Andhrew Carnaygie feel like goin' back to wurruk, he might as well make up his mind to remain a gay bachelor till he falls fr'm th' cab f'r th' las' time.  Not f'r him th' joys iv marrid life, th' futman at th' dure tellin' him his wife has not come home yet, th' prattlin' iv th' tendher infant as it is rocked to sleep in th' incybator, th' frequent letthers fr'm abroad askin' him if th' dhraft come.  No rayspictible woman wud have him while he was gettin' th' money an' none ought to have him afther he's got it.  \"Manetime th' price iv mathrimonyal coopon fours goes up till hardly annywan can think iv entherin' thim.  A man believes th' judge was wrong an' says he, 'I'll niver condimn Mary Josephine to be a poor man's wife.  I'll wait till I get a millyion.' It's not so hard to get a millyion nowadays if ye pick out th' right people to get it fr'm, but it takes some time, an' befure th' eager suitor has landed enough to sit in th' game, he's considherably past th' age iv consint.  Manetime father, too, hasn't been idle. He's bethrayed a few thrusts himsilf an' put a story or two on th' house.  So whin th' young man comes up wan night an' lays down his pile an' suggests that th' time has come f'r to hasten th' glad evint, father says: 'I'm afraid, me boy, that ye're a little slow.  Ye haven't kept pace with th' socyal requiremints.  Since seein' ye last, Mary Josephine has acquired th' use iv a private yacht an' is slowly mastherin' th' great truth that if ye have a club suit, ye ought to pass up th' make.  A slight oversight some afthernoon in distinguishin' thrumps an' they wudden't be enough iv that bundle left to put a rubber band around.  No, Mike, I think a gr-reat deal iv ye, but niver, niver will I consint that a daughter iv mine shud suffer th' pangs iv poverty.' An' so it goes through th' years until marredge, Hinnissy, is resthricted to th' very rich an' th' exthremely poor who're almost all marrid already.  \"I don't know mesilf what to think iv it, Hinnissy, an' I don't know that I ought to worry about it.  I haven't noticed anny reduction in th' number iv marredge licenses day be day.  Th' Kubelowskis an' th' Witsinskis still are exchangin' vows, an' if they've got more thin twinty-five dollars apiece I'd like to know where they got it an' notify th' polis.  No, sir, th' gloryous ol' instichooshion iv which I'm as proud as I am shy is here to stay, an' I'm thinkin' it'll be here whin money becomes extinct.  If th' rich are becomin' richer, th' poor are becomin' more foolish about these things, an' there's hope in that.\"  \"D'ye ra-ally think a man ought to marry on twinty-five dollars?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"If he's that kind iv a man, more money thin that wud be wasted on him,\" said Mr. Dooley.     Prince Henry's Visit   \"It's goin' to be gr-reat times f'r us Germans whin Prince Hinnery comes over,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"By th' way,\" said Mr. Hennessy with an air of polite curiosity, \"what relation's he to th' impror iv Germany? Is he th' son or th' nevvew?\"  \"He's nayther,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Th' impror has no sons that I iver heerd iv.  If he had a son he'd be a steam injine.  No, sir, this man is th' impror's brother Hinnery or Hans.  I don't exactly know what th' usual jooties iv an impror's brother is.  I know what an impror has to do.  His wurruk's cut out f'r him.  I cud fill th' job mesilf to me own satisfaction an' th' on'y wan an impror has to plaze is himsilf.  Th' German impror frequently mintions another, but on'y in th' way iv politeness.  I know what an impror's jooties is, but I don't know what an impror's brother has to do ex officio, as Hogan says.  But this boy Hinnery or Hans has more wurruk thin a bartinder in a prohibition town.  He's a kind iv travellin' agent f'r th' big la-ad.  His bag is ready packed ivry night, he sleeps like a fireman with his pants in his boots beside his bed, an' they'se a thrap dure alongside th' cradle f'r him to slide down to th' first flure.  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4729"],["title","Observations By Mr. Dooley (#7)"],["body","He's no more thin got to sleep whin th' three iliven sounds on th' gong.  In Hinnery leaps to th' pantaloons, down th' laddher he goes pullin' up his suspinders with wan hand an' puttin' on his hat with th' other an' off he is f'r Corea or Chiny or Booloochistan at a gallop.  His brother stands at th' dure an' hollers farewell to him.  'Go, Hinnery,' he says.  'Go, me dear brother, to th' land iv perpetchooal sunshine an' knock in nails f'r to hang up th' German armor,' he says.  'Knock in th' nails, an' if ye happen to hit ye'ersilf on th' thumb, swear on'y be th' German Mike an' raymimber ye done it f'r me,' he says.  'I will remain at home an' conthrol th' rest iv th' wurruld with th' assistance iv that German Providence that has been as kind to us as we desarve an' that we look up to as our akel,' he says.  An' Hinnery goes away.  He travels o'er land an' sea, be fire an' flood an' field.  He's th' ginooine flyin' Dutchman.  His home is in his hat.  He hasn't slept all night in a bed f'r tin years.  'Tis Hinnery this an' Hinnery that; Hinnery up th' Nile an' Hinnery to Injy; Hinnery here an' Hinnery there.  Th' cuffs iv his shirt is made iv th' time cards iv railroads.  Ivry time they'se a change in schedool he ordhers new shirts.  He knows th' right iv way fr'm Berlin to Ballymaehoo; he speaks all known languages, an' ivrywhere he goes he makes a frind or an inimy, which is th' same thing to th' Germans.  He carries a sample case undher wan arm an' a gun undher th' other, an' if ye don't like Rhine wine perhaps ye'll take lead.  On second considherations he won't shoot ye but he'll sell ye th' Krupp.  They'se more where it come fr'm.  \"I tell ye, Hinnissy, this Impror or Kaiser iv Germany is a smart man.  I used to think 'twas not so.  I thought he had things unaisy in his wheel-house.  I mind whin he got th' job, ivrywan says: 'Look out f'r war.  This wild man will be in that office f'r a year whin he'll just about declare fight with th' wurruld.' An' ivrybody framed up f'r him.  But look ye what happened.  'Tis twinty years since he was swore in an' ne'er a fight has he had. Ivrybody else has been in throuble.  A screw-maker iv a sindintary life has ploonged England into a war; me frinds th' Greeks that were considhered about akel to a flush iv anger over a raid on a push cart has mixed it up with th' Turks; th' Japs has been at war, an' th' Dagoes; our own peace-lovin' nation has been runnin' wan short an' wan serryal war, an' aven th' Chinese has got their dandher up, be hivins, but Willum, th' Middleweight Champeen, Willum th' Potsdam Game Chicken, Willum, th' Unterdenlinden Cyclone, Willum has been ladin' th' ca'm an' prosperous life iv a delicatessen dealer undher a turner hall.  He's had no fights.  He niver will have anny fights.  He'll go to his grave with th' repytation iv nayether winnin' nor losin' a battle, but iv takin' down more forfeits thin anny impror pugilist iv our time.  \"What do I think iv him? Well, sir, I think he's not a fighter but a fight lover.  Did ye iver see wan iv thim young men that always has a front seat at a scrap so near th' ring that whin th' second blows th' wather he gets what's left on his shirt front? Well, that's me frind Willum.  He is a pathron iv spoort an' not a spoort. His ideel is war but he's a practical man.  He has a season ticket to th' matches but he niver will put on the gloves.  He's in the spoortin' goods business an' he usu'lly gets a percintage iv th' gate receipts.  If he sees two nations bellowin' at each other th' assurances iv their distinguished considheration, he says: 'Boys, get together.  'Tis a good match.  Ye're both afraid.  Go in, uncle; go in, Boer.' He is all around th' ringside, encouragin' both sides. 'Stand up again' him there, Paul; rassle him to th' flure.  Good f'r ye, uncle.  A thrifle low, that wan, but all's fair in war. Defind ye'er indipindance, noble sons iv Teutonic blood.  Exercise ye'er sov'reign rights, me English frinds.' If wan or th' other begins to weaken th' first bottle through th' ropes is Willum's. Whin annybody suggests a dhraw, he demands his money back.  Nawthin' but a fight to a finish will do him.  If ayether iv th' contestants is alive in th' ring at th' end, he congratulates him an' asks him if he heerd that German cheer in th' las' round.  \"Oh, he's good.  He'll do all right, that German man.  In high di-plomacy, he's what in low di-plomacy wud be called a happy jollyer.  But he knows that if a man's always slappin' ye on th' back, ye begin to think he's weak; so he first shakes his fist undher ye'er nose an' thin slaps ye on th' back.  Sometimes he does both at th' same time.  An' he's got th' thrue jollyer's way iv provin' to ye that he's ye'er frind alone an' th' deadly inimy iv all others.  He's got th' Czar iv Rooshya hypnotized, th' King iv England hugged to a standstill, an' th' Impror iv Chiny in tears. An' he's made thim all think th' first thing annywan knows, he'll haul off an' swing on wan iv th' others.  \"So, havin' fixed ivrything up in Europe, he cast his eyes on this counthry, an' says he: 'I think I'll have to dazzle thim furriners somewhat.  They've got a round-headed man f'r prisidint that was born with spurs on his feet an' had a catridge-belt f'r a rattle, an' some day his goolash won't agree with him an' he'll call th' bluff I've been makin' these manny years.  What'll I do to make thim me frinds so that 'twud be like settin' fire to their own house to attackt me? Be hivins, I've got it.  They're a dimmycratic people.  I'll sind thim a prince.  They can't keep him away, an' whin he lands, th' German popylation'll come out an' get up schootzenfists f'r him an' me fellow impror acrost th' say'll see how manny iv them there ar-re, an' he'll think twict befure he makes faces at me.  F'r, wanst a German, always a German be it iver so far,' he says.  'I'll sind thim Hinnery.  Hinnery! Turn in th' alarm f'r Hinnery,' he says.  Hinnery slides down th' pole an' th' Impror says: 'Brother, catch th' night boat f'r America an' pay a visit to whativer king they have there.  Take along annywan ye like an' as manny thrunks as ye need, an' stay as long as ye plaze.  Don't ring.  Back th' dhray again' th' front dure an' hurl ye'ersilf into th' first bed room ye see.  Act just as if ye was me,' he says.  'But I'm not invited,' says Hinnery. 'Write ye'er own invitation,' says Willum.  'Here's th' answer: 'Fellow Potyntate, Ye'ers iv th' second instant askin' me brother Hinnery to spind a year with ye, not received.  In reply will say that nawthin' cud give me gr-reater pleasure.  He can stay as long as he plazes.  Him an' his soot will not need more thin th' whole house, so ye can have th' barn to ye'ersilf.  If ye have a brother, don't neglect to sind him over to see me.  I know a good hotel at four a day, all included but candles, an' if he stands at th' front window, he can see me go by anny day.  Ye'ers, Willum, Rex an' a shade more.'  \"So here comes Hinnery, an' we're goin' to give him a gloryous rayciption.  Th' war vessels will be out to welcome him, th' prisidint will meet him at th' dock an' he will be threated to wan continyous round iv schutzenfists, turnd'yeminds, sangerbunds, katzenjammers, skats, an' other German fistivals.  Th' aristocracy iv New York is practicin' Dutch an' th' Waldorf-Astorya will be festooned with dachshunds.  He'll see more Germans an' more German Germans thin he iver see in Prooshya.  An' I hope he'll have a good time.\"  \"I wondher what Tiddy Rosenfelt thinks iv it?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"Well, what wud ye think if ye'd had to intertain a German Prince unawares? Ye'd give him th' best ye'd got, ye'd dig up a bottle iv Knockimheimer down th' sthreet an' ye'd see that he got a noodle ivry time he reached.  An' whin he wint away, ye'd go as far as th' dure with him an' pat him on th' back an' say: 'Good-bye, good-bye, Hinnery.  Good-bye, Hans.  Guten nobben, oof veedersayin, me boy.  Good luck to ye.  Look out f'r that shtep! There ye ar-re. Be careful iv th' gate.  D'ye think ye can get home all right? I'd go as far as th' car with ye if I had me coat on.  Well, good-bye lanksman.  Raymimber me to ye'er brother.  Tell him not to f'rget that little matther.  Oh, of coorse, they'se no counthry in th' wurruld like Germany an' we're uncivilized an' rapacyous an' will get our heads knocked off if we go into a fight.  Good-bye, mein frind.' An' whin ye'd shut th' dure on him, ye'd say: 'Well, what d'ye think iv that?'\"     Prince Henry's Reception   \"That Prince Hinnery seems to be havin' a good time,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"He's havin' th' time iv his life,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Not since th' Hohnezollern fam'ly was founded be wan iv th' ablest burglars iv th' middle ages has anny prince injyed such a spree as this wan.  Ye see, a prince is a gr-reat man in th' ol' counthry, but he niver is as gr-reat over there as he is here.  Whin he's at home he's something th' people can't help an' they don't mind him. He's like an iron lamp post, station'ry, ornymintal, an' useful to let people know where they are.  But whin he comes to this home iv raypublican simplicity, he's all that th' wurrud prince wud imply, an' it implies more to us thin to annywan else.  I tell ye, we're givin' him th' best we have in th' shop.  We're showin' him that whativer riv'rince we may feel tow'rd George Wash'nton, it don't prejudice us again' live princes.  Th' princes we hate is thim that are dead an' harmless.  We've rayceived him with open arms, an' I'll say this f'r him, that f'r a German he's a good fellow.  \"That's as far as I care to go, havin' lived f'r manny years among th' Germans.  I'm not prejudiced again' thim, mind ye.  They make good beer an' good citizens an' mod-rate polismen, an' they are fond iv their fam'lies an' cheese.  But wanst a German, always Dutch.  Ye cudden't make Americans iv thim if ye called thim all Perkins an' brought thim up in Worcester.  A German niver ra-aly"]]]
