That is enough about me.  Now let us get back to the congregation.  It was a representative throng, yet not entirely representative.  For one thing, our chief territorial and social luminary, Lord Eskerley, is a member of the Church of England; and when he goes to church at all—which is usually just after a heart-attack, or just before a General Election—he goes to Fiddrie.  For another, no Scottish assemblage can be counted truly representative which takes no account of the adherents of Holy Church—as a peep into Father Kirkpatrick’s tightly-packed conventicle on the other side of the glen would tell us.  But when all is said, the parish church is still the focus of Scottish rural life, and I was well content with the selection of friends who filled the pews below me.  There was old General Bothwell, of Springburn, a Mutiny and Crimean veteran—altogether quite a celebrity among a generation which knows nothing of actual warfare.  (After all, the South African affair touched our civil community very lightly.)  Beside the General sits his son Jack, home on leave from India.  He commands a company in a Pathan regiment.  The General is trying hard not to look proud of Jack.  Just behind the Bothwells sit the Graemes, of Burling—Sir Alistair, his Lady, and their three tall daughters, known and celebrated throughout the county as \"The Three Grenadiers.\"  Across the aisle sits old Couper, of Abbottrigg—the largest farmer in the district, and one of the best curlers in Scotland—with his wife.  The old couple are alone now, for all their sons and daughters are married.  However, a good many of them are present in other parts of the church, holding a fidgety third generation down in its seat.  Just in front of the Coupers I observe Mr. Gillespie, manager of our branch of the Bank of Scotland, a man of immense discretion and many secrets.  With him, Mrs. Gillespie.  Also the two Misses Gillespie, locally and affectionately renowned as \"Spot\" and \"Plain.\"  I notice that their son, Robert, who is studying for the Ministry in distant Edinburgh, is with them for the week-end.  Farther back, at the end of a long pew, just under the public gallery, sits Galbraith, our chemist and druggist, a small man with a heavy cavalry moustache and—the not uncommon accompaniment of a small man—a large wife and twelve children.  The children fall into two groups, separated by an interval of seven years. The first group—four in number, and somewhat wizened in appearance—were born and reared upon the slender profits of a retail business in tooth-brushes, patent medicines, and dog-soap. The other eight—fat and well-liking—began to appear serially after Mr. Galbraith had amassed a sudden and unexpected fortune out of a patent sheep-dip of his own invention, which has made the name of Galbraith celebrated as far away as Australia.  Over the way from Galbraith, in a side pew, sits Shanks, the joiner.  He is a poor creature, lacking in ability either to ply his trade or invent reasons for not doing so.  Eve used to say that Shanks never by any chance acceded to a professional summons, and that his excuses were three in number, and were employed in monotonous rotation—firstly, that he had swallowed some tacks; secondly, that he had had to bury \"a relation of the wife’s\"; thirdly, that one of his numerous offspring had been overtaken by a fit.  Behind Shanks sit the Misses Peabody.  They are the daughters of a retired merchant of Leith, who died many years ago.  They inhabit a villa on the outskirts of our little town, live on an annuity, and exist precariously in that narrow social borderland which divides town-folk from gentry.  Passing on, I note that Mr. Menzies, Lord Eskerley’s factor, has at last provided himself with a wife—a stranger to me.  Well, Menzies is well connected and has an excellent house; so, doubtless, the lady will be comfortable.  But I wish he had not gone so far afield.  There is nothing wrong with the girls in this district, Menzies!  _Experto crede_!  My eye wanders on over the bowed heads. Finally it reaches the third pew from the front, and I am aware of the handsome presence of my friend Eric Bethune, of Buckholm.  Beside him, bolt upright, with a critical eye fixed upon Doctor Chirnside, sits his eccentric lady mother.  Eric’s attitude is more devout, but I observe that his head is turned sideways, and that he is grinning sympathetically at Tommy Milroy over the way, whose little nose is being relentlessly pressed to the book-board by an iron maternal hand encased in a hot black kid glove.  Eric, although he is as old as myself, is still very much of a boy—or perhaps I ought, in strict candour, to say a child.  He was a child at school—in his exuberant vitality, his sudden friendships, his petulance. He was a child at Sandhurst; he was a child as a subaltern—at times, almost a baby.  But he has been my friend all my life, and I admire him more than any man I know; perhaps because he possesses all the qualities which I lack.  He is tall and debonair; I am—well, neither.  He is impulsive, frank, and popular; I am cautious, reticent and regarded as a little difficult.  (This is not true really, only there is no Eve now to tell me what to say to people.)  But, above all, Eric is a soldier.  In the South African War he was Adjutant of our Second Battalion.  They were sent out rather late, and only got to work after Paardeburg.  I was with the other battalion, and saw nothing of Eric, but his Colonel considered him the smartest Adjutant in the Division, and recommended him for the D.S.O.  He got it, but always declared that he had had no chance to earn it, except by instructing the men very thoroughly in what is vulgarly known as the art of \"Spit and Polish.\"  Certainly they were the best turned-out crowd I have ever seen, when they marched through the streets of Edinburgh on their return.  Directly after that we both went back to India. We were anxious to go. Eve had died just before I sailed for South Africa; Diana had broken off her engagement with Eric and married Tom Birnie three years earlier. But I did not stay in India very long.  I was restless for home again; and, having decided that the Regular Army could now get along without my services, I sent in my papers and settled in London.  When Roy was nine years old his mother followed her sister. She had survived Eve only six years, for the same lung trouble had marked them down long ago. After that Eric felt that he could come back to Buckholm.  So he came, and they gave him command of the Regimental Depot, with the rank of Major. The Depot is not far away from here, and he is able to join his mother at Buckholm for much of the time.  He is quite his old self now, and he has made the Third Battalion a marvel of smartness and efficiency.  But there is one house which he never visits—Baronrigg.  I do not blame him. His memories there are not like mine.  Moreover, besides hating Tom Birnie, he dislikes Roy.  I am surprised at this, because the boy is the image of his mother.  Still, I suppose a man may be forgiven for disliking a boy who should have been his own son, but is not. Anyhow, I know I shall not meet Eric during my stay at Baronrigg, so I have arranged to lunch at Buckholm after church to-day.  That covers the congregation, I think.  (Doctor Chirnside is working up to his peroration, and in a few minutes we shall be erect again.)  I look over them once more.  Altogether, a sturdy, satisfactory assemblage, from laird to ploughman. We have not changed much in the last two hundred years, nor will during the next two hundred, so far as I can see.  We are Conservatives of Conservatives, although we return a Liberal.  We shall go on tilling the fat soil, and raising fat cattle, and marrying young, and having big families, and sending a few of the boys into the Army, and a few to the Colonies, and keep the rest at home to marry strapping girls and have more big families, until the end of time.  We are a little disturbed, to be sure, at the present state of the world outside.  A street-bred Government, with both eyes on the industrial vote, has recently compelled us, even us, to disburse our hard-earned pennies upon stamps, to be stuck at frequent intervals upon an objectionable card.  We are informed that this wasteful and uncongenial exercise is designed to bestow upon us the benefits of insurance against sickness—upon us, who are never either sick or sorry; and if ever we are, are taken care of (under an unwritten compact of immemorial antiquity) by the employers who have known us and ours for generations back.  Other political upheavals are agitating the country, but they leave us cold in comparison with this superfluous imposition of benevolence.  But still, politicians are always with us, and must be endured; so what matter?  Our valleys stand so thick with corn that they laugh and sing, and even with Income Tax at one and twopence in the pound, things might be worse.  After all, we have our health, and perhaps it is our duty to contribute to the insurance of those sickly city folk.  A few stamps are not a very high price to pay for peace and prosperity and sleepy contentment in the heart of the British Empire.                                     *IV.*   ... I think I must have begun to nod a little. It was a warm morning, and the sunshine and the songs of the birds without, and the confidential rumblings of Doctor Chirnside within, had exercised a soporific effect.  But I opened my eyes with a jerk, and observed that the Netherby pew was occupied.  Netherby has stood empty so long that it is quite a shock to see its pew inhabited at all.  It is a conspicuous pew, in the corner of the church, to the left of the pulpit, and my unregenerate nephews and nieces call it \"The Loose Box.\"  It is built in the form of a hollow square, and is surrounded by dingy red rep curtains,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46549"],["title","The Willing Horse: A Novel (#3)"],["body","enable its occupants to gaze upon the officiating clergy without themselves being gazed upon by the congregation.  However, the pew is overlooked by the Baronrigg gallery.  This morning the Netherby pew contained seven occupants, humped devoutly round the square table in the centre.  Upon the table reposed a gentleman’s silk hat, or topper.  Now, in this part of the country, gentlemen do not wear silk hats on Sunday.  They wear bowlers, or Homburg hats, or even motoring caps.  Neither do they wear frock-coats, like the obvious proprietor of \"The Loose Box.\"  He was a squarely-built man, and from what I could see of his face, he wore mutton-chop whiskers.  There was also a middle-aged lady in a rather unsuitable hat. There were two boys of nineteen or twenty. There were two or three small children, constrained and restless.  There was an elderly man with a beard like a goat’s, gazing upwards at Doctor Chirnside with an air which struck me as critical.  One felt that he would have taken the Doctor’s place without any pressing whatsoever. I put him down for a visitor of some kind.  And there was a girl.  At least, there was a hat—a big black tulle hat—and I assumed that there was a girl underneath it.  I could see her frock, which was white.  So were her gloves, which extended above her elbows.  Her hands were long and slim.  I began to feel curious to see her face.  Suddenly I realised that I was not alone in this ambition.  On my left, that young rascal Roy was hanging outward and downward at a dangerous and indecorous angle, in a characteristically thorough attempt to look under the brim of the black tulle hat.  Needless to say, in romantic enterprises of this kind, competition, especially with the young, makes one feel merely foolish, so I resumed my normal position and closed my eyes with an air of severe reproof.  Almost directly afterwards the First Prayer came to a conclusion, and we all sat up.  Simultaneously the girl in the hat lifted her head.  The Parish Church is small and the range was comparatively short.  For a moment her face was upturned in our direction.  I heard Roy give a gasp of admiration.  \"Let us read together,\" suggested the indefatigable Doctor Chirnside, \"in the Fifty-Fifth Chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah. Chapter Fifty-Five.  The first verse.  _Ho, every one that thirsteth..._\"  But I am afraid I was not listening.  I was watching the girl’s face—as well I might, for it was the face of a flower.  She leaned back in her seat against the wall, and composed herself for the Fifty-Fifth Chapter of Isaiah.  Suddenly, for some reason, she lifted her head again.  This time her eyes encountered Master Roy’s honest and rapturous gaze.  They fell immediately, but up from the open throat of her white Sunday frock, over her face, and right into the roots of her abundant fair hair, ran a vivid burning blush.  I looked at Roy.  He was crimson too.  Spring!  Spring!  Spring!                                   *CHAPTER II*                           *REBELLIOUS MARJORIE*                                     *I*   While Sunday at Baronrigg was a day of mild tribulation, Sunday at Netherby was a day of wrath.  It was a direct survival of the darkest period of the Victorian era.  Albert Clegg—or, rather, Mr. Albert Clegg—believed in taking no risks with his immortal soul, or with those of his family.  He also believed in being master in his own house.  Accordingly, when he bade his household remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, the household, as they say in the Navy, \"made it so.\"  The necessary standard of sanctity was attained, firstly, by the removal on Saturday night to locked cupboards of everything in the shape of frivolous or worldly literature; in place of which there appeared a few \"Sunday\" books—the latest record, mayhap, of missionary endeavour, together with one or two godly romances of a rather distressing character.  Periodical literature was represented by _The Sunday at Home_, while unsecular comment on current events was furnished by that brilliantly ingenious combination of broad religion and literary entertainment, _The British Weekly_.  The necessary atmosphere having been duly created, those two powerful engines, Prayer and Fasting, were now set in motion.  The latter, to be just, was of little account: its operation merely involved the omission of afternoon tea and the substitution of cold supper for ordinary dinner. But the devotional programme of the Clegg Sunday was an exacting business.  It opened with family prayers at eight-thirty a.m., including an extemporary supplication by the master of the house.  Catechism came at nine-thirty, Church at eleven o’clock.  The household were conveyed thither in the Rolls-Royce.  In the course of time, as the glory of that extremely new vehicle faded, and the task of making an impression upon the neighbourhood accomplished itself, the young Cleggs gloomily foresaw a still further extension of Sabbath observance, in the direction of pedestrian exercise.  Meanwhile, they covered the three miles to church in the car, and were thankful for small mercies.  After one o’clock dinner, the family sang hymns.  Marjorie accompanied—not very convincingly, owing to the presence of a surreptitious novel or volume of poetry propped upon the music-rest beside the hymn-book.  You cannot engage in psalmody and mental culture simultaneously with any degree of plausibility.  The younger children sang a shrill soprano; brothers Amos and Joe growled self-consciously an octave—sometimes two octaves—lower.  Sister Amy—a plain but intensely pious child of fourteen—offered a windy and unmelodious contribution which she termed \"seconds.\"  Mrs. Clegg sang—as she did everything else—dutifully, and slightly apologetically.  Mr. Clegg sang what he had imagined for more than thirty years to be tenor, inciting his fellow-choristers to continued effort by beating time with his hymn-book, until post-prandial drowsiness intervened, and he retired to bed, with all his clothes on, for his Sabbath nap.  During this interval the family enjoyed a slight respite from Sabbath observance—all, that is, but the younger members, who received instructions in Biblical history from two small and not uninteresting manuals, entitled _Peep of Day_ and _Line Upon Line_, with maternal additions and elucidations of a somewhat surprising character.  At six o’clock the chauffeur was once more called upon to observe the Sabbath by conveying the family to evening service at the parish church. The small fry, in consideration of _Peep of Day_ and _Line Upon Line_, were permitted to go to bed.  After cold supper at eight-thirty, the devotional exercises of the day petered out with a second instalment of family prayers, including what brother Joe (Marjorie’s accomplice and pet) was wont to describe as \"a final solo from Pa.\"  After that, the exhausted household retired to rest, leaving the master to relax himself from the spiritual tension of the day with weak whisky-and-water.  Albert Clegg had bought Netherby a year previously.  He came from the North of England, and was deeply interested in Tyneside shipping. His father had been a small tradesman in Gateshead. Albert’s initial opportunities had not been too great, but he possessed two priceless natural assets—superb business capacity and a sincere dislike for recreation or amusement of any kind. At twenty-one he was a clerk in a rather moribund shipping business.  At twenty-five he was managing clerk.  In that capacity he took it upon himself, unofficially, to investigate the books of the firm—he was the sort of young man who would joyfully devote a series of fine Saturday afternoons to such an enterprise—and was ultimately able to expose a leakage of profits which had kept the venerable and esteemed cashier of the office in considerably greater comfort than his employers for the past ten years. Needless to say, Albert was the next cashier.  At thirty he was junior partner and practically dictator.  A few years later his exhausted seniors gave up the struggle, and allowed themselves to be bought out. Albert promptly called in his younger brother Fred, who, up to date, had been dividing his undoubted talents fairly evenly between jerry-building and revivalist preaching—a combination of occupations which enabled him to      _Compound for sins he was inclined to,_     _By damning those he had no mind to—_  thus marking himself down as an ultimate and inevitable ornament of our National Legislature. Fred was taken into partnership.  From that day the firm of Clegg Brothers went from strength to strength.  Albert Clegg’s first wife was what Lady Christina would have described as \"a young person of his own station in life.\"  She had died a few years after the birth of Master Amos.  The present Mrs. Clegg was a member of an aristocratic but impoverished family named Higgie, of Tynemouth, and she came to Albert just at a time when his rising fortunes called for a helpmeet possessed of the social accomplishments which he himself so entirely lacked.  On his second marriage, he removed from Gateshead to a large house in the pleasant suburb of Jesmond, and lived there for twenty years, while the Clegg firm prospered and the Clegg family multiplied.  As already foreshadowed, brother Fred’s combined reputations as a captain of industry and a silver-tongued orator presently wafted him into Parliament, where he established a reputation for verbosity and irrelevance remarkable even in that eclectic assembly.  That is all that need be said about Mr. Albert Clegg for the present. The main purpose of this brief summary of his character and achievements is to provide the reader with some sort of key—in so far as keys are of any use at all where feminine locks are concerned—to the character of that rather unexpected young person, his daughter Marjorie.  For it was from her father, most undoubtedly, that Marjorie derived her initiative and determination."]]]
