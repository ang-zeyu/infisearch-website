Did you ever see a millionaire groping in the gutter for a dropped coin?  His energy is nothing to that of the book-man who has reason to suspect—why he knows not—that here or there may perhaps lie hid and unrecognised a volume which fashion has made omnipotent.  And his energy is not confined to himself alone, for one decree of a naughty world changes not—it is ever the same: What many men want, more men will search for; what one man only has, many will want.  The path of the book-hunter is trodden flat and hard with countless footsteps, and this is the reason why it is so unsatisfactory to look specially for anything valuable.  We may take it, therefore, that, though hunting for books may be a highly exhilarating pastime, it is seldom remunerative from a pecuniary point of view.  There are, no doubt, hundreds of thousands of good and useful volumes which can be bought at any time for next to nothing; but they have no halo round them at the moment, and so they are abandoned to their fate by the typical collector, who insists not only on having the best editions in exchange for his money, but that his books shall be of a certain description—that is to say, of a kind to please him, or which for the time being is in great demand.  And men are pleased at various times by books of a widely different character, as the old catalogues tell us plainly enough.  In 1676, when William Cooper bookseller, dwelling at the Sign of the Pelican in Little Britain, held the first auction sale ever advertised in England—that of the library of Dr. Lazarus Seaman—works critical of the Fathers and Schoolmen; learned and critical volumes of distressing profundity, appealed to the comparative few who could read and write sufficiently well to make reading a pleasurable experience.  Poetry is absent entirely. Shakespeare and Milton are elbowed out by Puritan fanatics who fulminate curses against mankind.  No doubt, if a book-man of those days had been asked what kind of literature would be in vogue a couple of centuries hence, he would have pointed to Seaman’s collection and replied, ’Books like those can never die.  So long as learning holds its sway over the few, they will be bought and treasured by the many.’  In this he would have been wrong, for few people care nowadays for volumes such as these.  The times have changed utterly, and we with them.  At this same sale was a book which sold for less than almost any other, and it lay hidden away under this bald and misleading title: ’Veteris et Novi Testamenti in Ling. Indica, Cantabr. in Nova Anglia.’  Simply this, and nothing more.  No statement as to date, condition or binding appears in Cooper’s catalogue, and yet this Bible is none other than John Eliot’s translation into the Indian language, with a metrical version of the Psalms in the same vernacular, published at Cambridge, Mass., in 1663-61.  An auctioneer of the present day would print the title of this volume in large capitals, and tell us whether or no it had the rare dedication to King Charles II., of pious memory, which was only inserted in twenty copies sent to England as presents.  If it had, then this book, wherever it may be, is now worth much more than its weight in gold, for at Lord Hardwicke’s sale, held in London on June 29, 1888, such a desirable copy was knocked down for £580.  Why this immense advance in price, seeing that probably there is no man in England to-day who could read a single line of John Eliot’s free translation?  The reason is plain.  Since 1661 sleepy New England has vanished like the light canoes of countless Indians, and in the busy United States there has grown up a great demand for anything which illustrates the early history of North America.  Had such a contingency struck old Lazarus Seaman, he would have made his will to suit the exigences of the case, and perhaps taken more interest in John Eliot and his missionary enterprises than anyone did at the time, or has done since.  It may perhaps be said that Seaman’s library must have been of a special kind, one which such a learned divine might be expected to gather within his walls; but as a matter of fact this was not so.  Between 1676 and 1682, October to October in each of those years, exactly thirty sales of books were held by auction in London, among them the libraries of Sir Kenelm Digby, Dr. Castell, the author of the ’Lexicon Heptaglotton,’ Dr. Gataker, Lord Warwick, and other noted persons.  The general character of all the seventeenth-century catalogues which time has spared for our perusal is substantially the same. Every one of them reflects the taste and fashion of the day, as did Agrippa’s magic glass the forms of absent friends.  Still harping chiefly on theology! as Polonius might say, these catalogues are crammed with polemics and books of grave discourse. Anything which could not, by hook or by crook, be dragged, as to its contents, within the circumference of the fashionable craze, was disposed of for a trifling sum.  Even in 1682 the learned world, or at least our narrow corner of it, was inhabited almost entirely by crop-eared Puritans, with sugar-loaf hats on their heads and broad buckles to their shoes, and by Philosophers.  True!  Cromwell had gone to his account, and Charles II. held Court at St. James’s and elsewhere, but the King and his merry companions were not reading men unless a profound knowledge of ’Hudibras,’ that book which Pepys could not abide the sight of, could make them so.  The anti-Puritans patronized Butler, and doted on Sir Charles Sedley, the Earl of Rochester and a few more, who scribbled love-verses by day, and gambled and fought and drank at night.  But these worshipped Thalia and Erato only, with music and dancing and other delights, and knew nothing of solid hard work by the midnight oil.  They had no books to speak of, and the few they had were light and airy like themselves, and for the most part as worthless.  On November 25, 1678, a great sale was held at the White Hart, in Bartholomew Close.  The books were ’bought out of the best libraries abroad, and out of the most eminent seats of learning beyond the seas,’ or, more truthfully, had been removed from the shops of seven London book-sellers who had combined to rig the market.  Books of all kinds were dispersed at this sale, which continued _de die in diem_ till the heptarchy was satisfied.  Were the members of this pioneer combination alive now, they would weep to think that they gave away on that occasion—practically gave away—scores of what have long since become aristocrats among books. Americana were there in plenty, and some of these are now so extremely rare and valuable that they are hardly to be procured for love or money; some few, indeed, have completely disappeared, tossed lightly aside, probably by disgusted purchasers, or carted back again to the shops from whence they came, to be stacked once more till they perished utterly of damp and neglect, moth, mice and rust. On the other hand our old friends, the Puritans, revelled in grim folios bought up at prices which, the change in the value of money notwithstanding, would hardly be exceeded now.  Walton’s ’Biblia Sacra Polyglotta’ was an immense favourite, a distinction it doubtless deserved, and, indeed, deserves yet, though we can see that Walton must have ’gone down’ woefully in the last hundred years, when we come to calculate the necessaries of life that could be bought then with a piece of gold, and to contrast them with the meagre display such a sum would purchase now. The truth perhaps, is that, although education was less widely diffused in the days of the Stuarts, it was more deep and thorough.  A savant was then like a huge octopus that devastates whole districts, and daily grows fatter and more bloated at the expense of everything that moves within reach of its spreading tendrils.  To this effect are we taught by these ancient catalogues, which, however, do not exhaust all their interest in mere matters of prices and fashion.  We can learn much from their pages and advertisements of the manners and customs of our ancestors in Bookland.  It seems that there were travelling auctioneers a couple of centuries ago who prefaced their remarks with eulogies of the Mayor and Corporation of each town at which they stopped, by way, no doubt, of securing their patronage.  Sales began at eight o’clock in the morning then, and went on, with a mid-day interval for refreshment, until late at night.  Sometimes the auctioneer sold by the candle-end; that is to say, lit a morsel of candle on putting up some coveted volume for competition, and knocked it down to him who had bid the most when the light flickered out.  This was, distinctly, an excellent method for bolstering up excitement, for every splutter must have been good for a hasty advance, regretted very possibly when the modicum of tallow entered on a fresh lease of life. When not selling by the candle-end, an auctioneer would dispose of about thirty lots in the course of an hour, and was quite willing to accept the most trifling bids.  Business is more rapidly conducted now, for few auctioneers stop to curse their fate, or to regale their audience with anecdotes, as one George Smalridge, who in 1689 wrote and published a skit on the prevalent way of doing business, says was quite the usual custom in his day.  His tract is written in Latin, under the title ’Auctio Davisiana,’ and gives a fanciful account of the extraordinary proceedings that took place at the sale of the books of Richard Davis, an ancient bookseller of Oxford, who had fallen into the clutches of the bailiffs.  The auctioneer commences with a dirge said, or perhaps sung, over the miserable Davis: ’O the vanity of human wishes!  O the changeableness of fate and its settled unkindness to us,’ etc.  Each book is extolled at length, and there are pages of lamentation and woe"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],["title","The Romance of Book-Collecting (#2)"],["body"," Hobbes of Malmesbury, his ’Leviathan,’ ’a very large and famous beast,’ is knocked down, by mistake, for the miserable sum of five pieces of silver.  An exhaustive chapter on early book auctions would necessarily commence with the dispersion of the stock of Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevir at Leyden in April, 1653; but the Elzevirs must look to themselves, nor are these remarks intended to be even approximately full.  Rather are they discursive, and in praise of catalogues in the mass; intended merely to put someone else with more space and time at his disposal in the way of rescuing them from the neglect into which they have fallen.  The next chapter is more specific, for in that we will take a very famous sale of less antiquity, and endeavour to draw comparisons between then and now. And these comparisons will perhaps be very odious, for they will necessarily appeal directly to the cupidity of every bookworm that breathes, to every book-hunter who prowls around in search of rarities, and returns home—empty handed.                                  *CHAPTER II.*                         *A COMPARISON OF PRICES.*   The important sale to which reference was made in the last chapter is that of the library of John, Duke of Roxburghe, which was dispersed on May 18, 1812, and forty-one following days, by Robert H. Evans, a bookseller of Pall Mall.  This sale is of extreme interest for two reasons.  In the first place, the collection was the most extensive, varied, and important that had hitherto been offered for sale in England, or indeed, anywhere else; and, secondly, it may fairly be regarded in the light of a connecting-link between the old state of things and the new. The Roxburghe library was not ’erected,’ as Gabriel Naudæus has it, on traditional principles; it was of a general character that appealed to all classes of book-men.  On the other hand, it was not quite such a library as a collector of large means might be expected to get together at the present day, for the tendency is now to specialize, and in any case many of the books that the Duke obviously took an interest in are of such little importance now, and so infrequently inquired for, that they would most assuredly be refused admission to any private library of equal importance and magnitude.  Even a general lover would hardly be likely to manifest much interest in a number of volumes on Scots law or to hob-a-nob with Cheyne, who in 1720 wrote a book on the gout, or with Sir R. Blackmore, notwithstanding that eminent physician’s great experience of the spleen and vapours.  That lore of this kind has its merits I dispute in no way, but it is not exactly of a kind to interest the modern collector, who, even if he aim at all branches of literature alike, would much prefer to have his legal and medical instruction boiled down, so to speak, to the compass of a good digest or cyclopædia.  Nevertheless, May 18, 1812, is among the _fasti_ of those who to a love of letters add a passion for books.  It is the opening day of the new régime—the birthday, in fact, of those who revel in first editions and early English texts. Brunet said that the ’thermometer of bibliomania’—objectionable word!—’attained its maximum in England’ during these forty-two days of ceaseless hammering, and Dibdin went perfectly insane whenever he thought of this ’Waterloo among book-battles,’ as he called it.  Everyone of course knows the chief episode; that struggle between Earl Spencer and the Marquis of Blandford for the 1471 Boccaccio, in its faded yellow morocco binding, and how the latter carried it off for £2,260, a most idiotic price to pay, as subsequent events abundantly proved; for seven years later, when Lord Blandford’s library came to be sold, the coveted volume was acquired by his former rival for considerably less than half the money. It now reposes in state at Manchester, or, as some choose to say, is in prison there, though it is perhaps too much to expect that all good things should be forcibly removed to London, as some greedy Metropolitans wish them to be.  The Duke of Roxburghe’s library comprised rather more than 10,000 works in about 30,000 volumes, and the auctioneer’s method of classifying this large assortment was so peculiar that he feels constrained to apologize for it in a rather extensive preface.  ’For instance,’ says he, ’the _Festyvale_ of Caxton, printed in two columns, of which no other copy is at present known, may be found classed with a small edition of the Common Prayer of one shilling value.’  The ’Festyval’ brought £105, and the little Prayer-Book, which proves to have been printed at London in 1707, 8s. 6d., which is more than it would be at all likely to sell for now.  But what about Caxton’s lordly tome; how much might that be expected to bring in case it should once again find its way into the open market?  Judging from the present price of Caxtons, perhaps five or six times the money would not be an impossible figure, but there is no telling.  It might bring more, even though it has the misfortune to belong to the second edition, for only six copies are known, and several of those are imperfect. Of the first edition of 1483, only three perfect copies are to be met with, and that is, of course, quite a different matter.  The auctioneer need not, as it happens, have sought to excuse himself so energetically for placing good and bad books side by side, for the whole catalogue is arranged under subjects, and to do otherwise would have been manifestly impossible.  He might, however, have entered somewhat more fully into detail as to condition and binding, for some of the books were, confessedly, ’thumbed to tatters,’ and a suspicion that this or that ’lot’ may be so afflicted lurks in every page of the catalogue.  The first book brought to the hammer at this sale; the preliminary bombshell which, to pursue Dibdin’s metaphor, was the signal for a furious cannonade, consisted of the ’Biblia Sacra Græca,’ printed by Aldus in 1518.  This is the first complete edition of the Bible in Greek, and an important book on that account.  It brought £4 15s., and any book-hunter might heartily pray for half a dozen copies now, on the same terms, for the present auction value runs to about six times as much.  In fact, a sound copy sold only the other day for £27.  So, too, Schoiffer’s Latin Bible, printed at Mayence in 1472, folio, would be considered cheap now at £8 8s., assuming nothing was wrong with it.  In 1893 a copy in oak boards brought £20 exactly.  On the other hand, Baskerville’s Bible, Cambridge, 1763, was excessively dear at £10 15s., seeing that a very fair copy can be got at the present time for about £1 10s. Collectors of Bibles are responsible for much of the terrible confusion that takes place when we begin to draw comparisons in matters of filthy lucre.  If a Bible come from a noted press, or is an original edition of its version, or very old indeed, then up goes the price, especially if it be printed in English.  One would have thought that Baskerville being an Englishman, and a fine printer in his way, would have been good for much more than £1 10s.  But no; he has not been dead long enough, for the collectors have made it a rule that no English Bible printed after 1717 is any good at all, and consequently that the ’Vinegar Bible’ is the last book of the kind in point of date worth looking at, unless, indeed, exception be made in favour of one of the six large-paper copies of Bentham’s Cambridge Bible of 1762, which are reported to have luckily escaped a conflagration. The late Mr. Dore, who was a strong man on the subject of old Bibles, says that a little research would reveal the existence of many more than the traditional half-dozen copies, so perhaps, after all, the conflagration is a myth. But if Baskerville’s Bible brought what we should now consider to be an outrageous sum, what shall be said of ’The Holy Bible, illustrated with Prints, published by T. Macklin, six volumes, folio, 1800,’ which went for £43, incomplete though it was.  Some £2 10s. for the whole seven volumes is not at all an uncommon auction price at the present day, and this amount and more would most certainly be swallowed up by the binding alone.  What it comes to is that among all these books of theology, Biblical comment, criticism, polemics, sermons, and works of the Fathers, prices have fallen since 1812, except in those cases where collectors have stepped in to rescue old Bibles, works associated with some great religious revolution, or specimens of rare typography from the presses of old and noted printers.  For instance, there was here another Caxton called ’The Prouffytable boke for Mane’s Soul,’ folio, described as ’a beautiful copy,’ which went for £140, and ’A Lytell Treatyse called Lucydarye,’ 4to., Wynkyn de Worde, which brought £10.  During the last dozen years the former book has appeared twice.  At the Earl of Aylesford’s sale in March, 1888, it brought (in company with ’The Tretyse of the Love of Jhesu Christ,’ by Wynkyn de Worde, 1493) £305, and in July, 1889, an inferior copy, badly wormed, sold for £100.  These are the sort of books beloved by large public libraries, which are fast swallowing up the few that remain.  From a pecuniary point of view it would perhaps pay some rich book-hunter of the Lenox type to buy up everything of the kind he could lay his hands on, though the worst of speculations such as these is that the interest on the money invested has a tendency to swell the principal, and so to add enormously to the original cost.  Among books that have gone down in price since the Duke of Roxburghe made his famed collection are those classical works of the ancients which were at that time all the rage.  Virgil is no longer a name to conjure with, unless he happen to rank as a sound copy of the _editio princeps_.  The first edition of Virgil was printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz at Rome, without date (1469?), and the Duke,"]]]
