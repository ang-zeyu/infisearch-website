From the foregoing it is evident:  First.--That the Melchizedek Priesthood was greater than the Aaronic, and that while it ruled, it controlled all matters pertaining to the government and instruction of the people, and that it organized and directed the Aaronic Priesthood, which was in reality an appendage to the greater.  Second.--That when the Melchizedek Priesthood was in a great measure withdrawn, as there was no regular organization of that Priesthood, it was left to a great extent to the guidance and direction of the Lord, who, from time to time, inspired different men as Prophets, who came to the people with the word of the Lord, receiving their inspiration and calling directly from him, as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and others. But that a portion of Moses' spirit rested upon Joshua, upon the seventy Elders of Israel, upon the Prophets in the days of Elijah, Elisha and others.  Third.--That the Aaronic Priesthood continued in its full force, having a complete organization, which it received under the hands of Moses, or through the Melchizedek Priesthood.  Fourth.--That the Aaronic Priesthood, being continued, it held the Urim and Thummim, and gave direction to Joshua, who was set apart by Moses, and to Saul, David, Solomon and others, who were anointed and set apart to their kingly power, and to rule over and to lead and direct Israel, and that this state of things continued until Christ. The High Priests of the Aaronic Priesthood being the acknowledged representatives of God, holding the priestly power: whilst the kings were anointed by them, or by their priestly authority, and the kings and rulers had to get the word of the Lord from the Aaronic Priesthood, or through the Urim and Thummim.  Fifth.--It is further evident that this Priesthood became, in many instances, very corrupt, and incurred the displeasure of God, and that many of the kings also, though anointed, perverted their office and calling, and instead of being the protectors and saviors of Israel, helped to lead them astray.  Sixth.--It is evident that all the Aaronic Priesthood did not have the Urim and Thummim, nor did they call, anoint and direct kings, or bear rule in the nation. But only the High Priest--one man--and that one man presided over and directed the action of the kings, telling them when to go out to war, and when not to go, and giving unto them the word of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim.  Seventh.--That they only had one tabernacle, one ark of the covenant, or one temple at one time; and not as we, many stakes, many temples, and many services. But then they, when Moses left, were under the Aaronic, and we are under the Melchizedek Priesthood; they were under the law and the Mosaic dispensation; we are under the Gospel, and in the dispensation of the fullness of time, and have consequently labors and duties to perform which did not belong to them.  It may be proper here to remark that there was a council, called a \"senate of the children of Israel.\"--Acts v, 21. The High Priest called this council together. The council, it is said, was composed of seventy men or judges, and to have taken its rise from the installment of the seventy Elders spoken of in Num. xi, 16, 17. They were to be known by Moses to be Elders of the people and officers over them--\"Able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness\"--a portion of Moses' spirit was to be given unto them, and they were to help him to bear the burdens of the people. As Saul was anointed by Samuel to be captain over the Lord's inheritance, and the Spirit of the Lord was to come upon him, and he was to prophesy and be turned into another man. (See I. Samuel x, 6.) And God gave him another heart, and all the signs came to pass that day, and he prophesied.  This senate or council was known by the name of the Sanhedrim, and it is said, sat in the form of a half moon. This council is spoken of in John xi, 47-52. \"Then gathered the Chief Priests and Pharisees a council. * * And one of them named Caiaphas, the High Priest, said * * it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people. * * And this spake he not of himself; but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation, and not for that nation only; but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.\" \"Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.\"--John xviii, 14. This council had not the power of death, (ver. 31.) (See also Acts iv, v and vi.) About this Sanhedrim there is little or nothing said in the Old Testament nor of the organization of this court. It is thought by some it existed after the captivity, or in the days of the Maccabees only.  There is another remarkable thing about the Aaronic Priesthood, or at least about the early action of Aaron, as an associate of Moses. When Moses was first called upon to deliver Israel from Egyptian bondage, he told the Lord that they would not believe him, nor hearken unto his voice, and Moses was told to cast his rod upon the ground, and it became a serpent, and he fled from before it; but when the Lord told Moses to take it by the tail, and he caught it, it became a rod again. Then the Lord told him to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out it was leprous. He was told to put it into his bosom again, and it was restored and like his other flesh. Still, Moses was unconvinced and said, \"O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue. And the Lord said unto him. Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord? Now therefore, go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.\"--Ex. iv, 10-12. Yet Moses was not satisfied and shrank from his mission, and said: \"O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of _him_ whom thou wilt send. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said. Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know, that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.\" (See the whole of chap. iv, Ex.)  From the above it would seem that if Moses would have done as the Lord requested him, Aaron would not have been called. Moses shrank from the responsibility; and though the Lord was angry with him yet he gave unto him a helper in Aaron. A revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, says: \"Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God; but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence, therefore the Lord in his wrath (for his anger was kindled against them) swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fullness of his glory. Therefore he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also; and the lesser Priesthood continued, which Priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory Gospel, which Gospel is the Gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath, caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb; for he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make straight the way of the Lord, before the face of his people to prepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power.\"--Doc. and Cov. Sec. 84, pars. 23-88. pp. 290-1. Again, Paul says, \"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another Priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.\"--Heb. vii, 11, 12. (See also chapters viii, ix and x.) John the Baptist came as the forerunner of Christ, and baptized him as stated. \"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him. Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo, a voice from heaven, saying. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\"--Matt, iii, 13-17. On inquiry being made, Jesus said of John the Baptist, \"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\"--Matt, xi, 11. Again Jesus said, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias which was for to come. He that hath ears to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46221"],["title","Items on the Priesthood, presented to the Latter-day Saints (#3)"],["body","ear, let him hear.\" (vers. 14, 15.) But they would not receive it: they beheaded John and crucified Jesus; hence the restoration, the mission of Elias was postponed until he appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. (Doc. and Gov. Sec. ex, p. 405.) At which time Elijah came, as Malachi says: \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\"--Mal. iv, 5, 6.  It seems from the foregoing that Moses had the greater or Melchizedek Priesthood; that when he was taken, the keys went with him; that the Aaronic Priesthood ruled until Christ, and the people were under the law; that when Christ came he introduced a better covenant and restored the Gospel; and that the Bishopric was, and the Aaronic Priesthood is, under the Melchizedek, and an appendage thereto, as are also all Elders appendages to the Melchizedek Priesthood; and it is also evident that the Presidency of that Priesthood presides over all, as did Melchizedek, Moses, Joseph Smith, etc., with Jesus at the head, as the great Presiding High Priest.  But if, as Paul says, the Priesthood being changed, then is made of necessity a change also of the law; or in other words, a change from the law of carnal commandments and ordinances to the law of the Gospel. Yet the Aaronic Priesthood, as the Melchizedek, is an everlasting Priesthood, as before exhibited, and continueth forever as an appendage to the Melchizedek Priesthood; and hence in the old apostolic days, when under an organization of the Melchizedek, the latter is the most prominent, and very little is said about the Levitical or Aaronic: probably on account of the peculiar traditions and superstitions of the Jews, which made it almost impossible for them to comprehend the greater or Melchizedek. Yet the Aaronic cannot be ignored, and in the dispensation of the fullness of times it again comes forth, as one of the grand aids or appendages to the Melchizedek Priesthood; and hence in the ushering in of this dispensation, John the Baptist appears on the stage and confers the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.  Having therefore traced out these two Priesthoods, principally from the old Scriptures, we how turn to the revelations given by Joseph Smith in the introduction of the Priesthood, as revealed by the Latter-day Prophet in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times.    PRINCIPALLY ON THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD OR BISHOPRIC.  THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD CONFERRED.  \"Words of the Angel, John, (the Baptist,) spoken to Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver Cowdery, as he (the angel) laid his hands upon their heads and ordained them to the Aaronic Priesthood, in Harmony, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, May 15th, 1829:  \"Upon you, my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the Gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.\"--Doc. and Cov., Sec 13, p. 108.  We quote from some of the first revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith upon this subject. \"Every President of the High Priesthood (or Presiding Elder,) Bishop, High Councilor, and High Priest, is to be ordained by the direction of a High Council or General Conference. Presiding Elders, Traveling Bishops, High Councilors, High Priests, and Elders, may have the privilege of ordaining where there is no branch of the Church.\"--Doc. and Cov., Sec. 20, pars. 67, 66, p. 127. At this time Presidents of the High Priesthood, Presiding Elders, Bishops, High Councilors, and High Priests were placed on the same footing. It may be observed that Traveling Bishops are here referred to. These were given for the regulation of the newly organized branches or churches.  From the above we learn: That before the appointment of Bishops there were revelations given and arrangements made for this office. Whilst the following teaches us:  That certain men among the Saints should be appointed by the voice of the Church, to look after the poor and needy, and to govern the affairs of the property of the Church. \"And now I give unto the Church in these parts, a commandment that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice of the Church; and they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief, that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I have commanded them.\"--Sec. 38, pars. 34, 35, p. 163. The place referred to at that time was Kirtland, Geauga Co., Ohio. (par. 32.)  Edward Partridge was ordained a Bishop--the first Bishop in the Church--and was called Feb. 4, 1831. He was to _spend all his time in the labors of the Church_. We quote: \"And again, I have called my servant Edward Partridge, and give a commandment, that he should be appointed by the voice of the Church, and ordained a Bishop unto the Church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the Church: to see to all things as it shall be appointed unto him, in my laws in the day that I shall give them.\"--Sec.41, pars. 9, 10, p. 168. He was to \"see to all things, as it _shall be appointed unto him, in my laws_\" [Who was to give these laws?] \"in the day that I shall give them.\"  Newel K. Whitney was the second Bishop--called _to be_ a Bishop, Dec. 4, 1831. \"And now, verily I say unto you, my servant Newel K. Whitney is the man who shall be appointed and ordained unto this power. Even so. Amen.\"--Sec. 72, par. 8, p.257. \"And again, I say unto you, that my servant Edward Partridge shall stand in the office wherewith I have appointed him. And it shall come to pass, that if he transgresses, another shall be appointed in his stead. Even so. Amen.\"--Sec. 42, par. 10, p. 169; Feb. 9, 1831.  Property was to be consecrated for the poor, and laid before the Bishop and his counselors, who are to be two Elders or High Priests. (See sec. 42. pars. 30, 31, p. 171) The residue was to be kept in a storehouse for the poor and needy, as shall be appointed by the High Council and the Bishop and his Council and for _purchasing Church lands, building houses of worship_, building up the New Jerusalem; of course he was to act as a general Bishop of the Church, (he was not confined to a ward,) to receive and distribute property, appoint stewardships, etc. It will be perceived that the High Council then had a voice in these matters. It is written:  \"And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor ye will do it unto me, and they shall be laid before the Bishop of my Church and his Counselors, two of the Elders, or High Priests, such as he shall or has set apart for that purpose. And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the Bishop of my Church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my Church, that they cannot be taken from the Church agreeable to my commandments; every man shall be made accountable unto me, a stewart over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, inasmuch as is sufficient for himself and family. And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the Church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support, after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the Bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied, and receive according to his wants. Therefore the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the High Council of the Church, and the Bishop and his Council. And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the Church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed.\"--Sec. 42, pars. 31-35, PP. 171-2.  The Bishop was to receive his support, and also his Counselors, or a remuneration for services. We read: \"And the Elders, or High Priests who are appointed to assist the Bishop, as Counselors in all things, are to have their families supported out of the property which is consecrated to the Bishop, for the good of the poor, and for other purposes, as before mentioned; or they are to receive a just remuneration for all their services, either a stewartship or otherwise, as may be thought best or decided by the Counselors and Bishop, and the Bishop, also, shall receive his support, or a just remuneration for all his services in the Church.\"--Sec. 42, pars. 71-73, P. 175. (See also p. 257.)  \"And unto the Bishop of the Church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the Church, and to be Elders unto the Church, are to have it given unto them to discern all those gifts.\"--Sec. 46, par. 27, p. 193. Certain gifts were here referred to. Not only Bishops but Elders were to have this power. We further find that Edward Partridge was to appoint unto this people their portion--every man equal, giving him a writing--and every man was to deal honestly, and be and receive alike; one Church must not use the money of another Church without making arrangements to pay it. A storehouse was to be appointed. The Bishop was to receive unto himself and family what was needed for his wants, and for those of his family. This was to be an example unto Edward, Partridge, and to all Churches.  \"And let my servant, Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his portion, give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion. * * And let that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto that of another Church; wherefore, if another Church"]]]
