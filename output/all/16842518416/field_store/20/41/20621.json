It was by the merest chance that I came this way.”  “Will you add to my indebtedness by accompanying me with that trusty club of yours? I have some little distance yet to go, and the amount of money I have with me makes me feel desirous of taking every possible precaution.”  “Willingly,” said the cooper.  “But I am forgetting,” said the gentleman, “that you yourself will be obliged to return alone.”  “I do not carry enough money to make me fear an attack,” said Mr. Crump, laughing. “Money brings care I have always heard, and now I realize it.”  “Yet most people are willing to take their chance of that,” said the merchant.  “You are right, sir, nor can I call myself an exception. Still I should be satisfied with the certainty of constant employment.”  “I hope you have that, at least.”  “I have had until recently.”  “Then, at present, you are unemployed?”  “Yes, sir.”  “What is your business?”  “That of a cooper.”  “I must see what I can do for you. Can you call at my office to-morrow, say at twelve o'clock?”  “I shall be glad to do so, sir.”  “I believe I have a card with me. Yes, here is one. And this is my house. Thank you for your company, my good friend. I shall see you to-morrow.”  They stood before a handsome dwelling-house, from whose windows, draped by heavy crimson curtains, a soft light proceeded. The cooper could hear the ringing of childish voices welcoming home their father, whose life, unknown to them, had been in such peril, and he could not but be grateful to Providence that he had been the means of frustrating the designs of the villain who would have robbed him, and perhaps done him farther injury.  He determined to say nothing to his wife of the night's adventure until after his meeting appointed for the next day. Then if any advantage accrued to him from it, he would tell the whole at once.  When he reached home, Mrs. Crump was sewing beside the fire. Aunt Rachel sat with her hands folded in her lap, with an air of martyr-like resignation to the woes of life.  “I've brought you home a paper, Aunt Rachel,” said the cooper, cheerfully. “You may find something interesting in it.”  “I sha'n't be able to read it this evening,” said Rachel, mournfully. “My eyes have troubled me lately. I feel that it is more than probable that I am growing blind. But I trust I shall not live to be a burden to you. Your prospects are dark enough without that.”  “Don't trouble yourself with any fears of that sort, Rachel,” said the cooper, cheerily. “I think I know what will enable you to use your eyes as well as ever.”  “What?” asked Rachel, with melancholy curiosity.  “A pair of spectacles,” said her brother, incautiously.  “Spectacles!” retorted Rachel, indignantly. “It will be a good many years before I am old enough to wear spectacles. I didn't expect to be insulted by my own brother. But it's one of my trials.”  “I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Rachel,” said the cooper, perplexed.  “Good night,” said Rachel, rising and taking a small lamp from the table.  “Come, Rachel, don't go yet. It is early.”  “After what you have said to me, Timothy, my self-respect will not permit me to stay.”  Rachel swept out of the room with something more than her customary melancholy.  “I wish Rachel war'n't quite so contrary,” said the cooper. “She turns upon a body so sudden, it's hard to know how to take her. How's the little girl, Mary?”  “She's been asleep ever since six o'clock.”  “I hope you don't find her very much trouble. That all comes upon you, while we have the benefit of the money.”  “I don't think of that, Timothy. She is a sweet child, and I love her almost as much as if she were my own. As for Jack, he perfectly idolizes her.”  “And how does Aunt Rachel look upon her?”  “I am afraid she will never be a favorite with Rachel.”  “Rachel never took to children much. It isn't her way. Now, Mary, while you are sewing, I will read you the news.”    CHAPTER VI. WHAT THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED.    THE card which had been handed to Timothy Crump contained the name of Thomas Merriam,----Wall Street. Punctually at twelve, the cooper reported himself at the counting-room, and received a cordial welcome from the merchant.  “I am glad to see you,” he said. “I will come to business at once, as I am particularly engaged this morning. Is there any way in which I can serve you?”  “Not unless you can procure me a situation, sir.”  “I think you told me you were a cooper.”  “Yes sir.”  “Does this yield you a good support?”  “In good times it pays me two dollars a day. Lately it has been depressed, and for a time paid me but a dollar and a half.”  “When do you anticipate its revival?”  “That is uncertain. It may be some months first.”  “And, in the mean time, you are willing to undertake some other employment?”  “Yes, sir. I have no objection to any honest employment.”  Mr. Merriam reflected a moment.  “Just at present,” he said, “I have nothing to offer except the post of porter. If that will suit you, you can enter upon the duties to-morrow.”  “I shall be very glad to take it, sir. Anything is better than idleness.”  “Your compensation shall be the same that you have been accustomed to earn by your trade,--two dollars a day.”  “I only received that in the best times,” said Timothy, conscientiously.  “Your services will be worth it. I will expect you, then, to-morrow morning at eight. You are married, I suppose?”  “Yes, sir. I am blessed with a good wife.”  “I am glad of that. Stay a moment.”  The merchant went to his desk, and presently returned with a scaled envelope.  “Give that to your wife,” he said.  The interview terminated, and the cooper went home, quite elated by his success. His present engagement would enable him to bridge over the dull time, and save him from incurring debt, of which he had a just horror.  “Just in time,” said Mrs. Crump. “We've got an apple-pudding to-day.”  “You haven't forgotten what I like, Mary.”  “There's no knowing how long you will be able to afford puddings,” said Aunt Rachel. “To my mind it's extravagant to have meat and pudding both, when a month hence you may be in the poor-house.”  “Then,” said Jack, “I wouldn't eat any.”  “Oh, if you grudge me the little I eat,” said his aunt, in severe sorrow, “I will go without.”  “Tut, Rachel, nobody grudges you anything here,” said her brother, “and as to the poor-house, I've got some good news to tell you that will put that thought out of your heads.”  “What is it?” asked Mrs. Crump, looking up brightly.  “I have found employment.”  “Not at your trade?”  “No, but at something else, which will pay equally well, till trade revives.”  Here he told the story of the chance by which he was enabled to serve Mr. Merriam, and of the engagement to which it had led.  “You are, indeed, fortunate,” said Mrs. Crump. “Two dollars a day, and we've got nearly the whole of the money that came with this dear child. How rich we shall be!”  “Well, Rachel, where are your congratulations?” asked the cooper of his sister, who, in subdued sorrow, was eating her second slice of pudding.  “I don't see anything so very fortunate in being engaged as a porter,”  said Rachel, lugubriously. “I heard of a porter, once, who had a great box fall upon him and crush him; and another, who committed suicide.”  The cooper laughed.  “So, Rachel, you conclude that one or the other is the inevitable lot of all who are engaged in this business.”  “It is always well to be prepared for the worst,” said Rachel, oracularly.  “But not to be always looking for it,” said her brother.  “It'll come, whether you look for it or not,” returned his sister, sententiously.  “Then, suppose we spend no thoughts upon it, since, according to your admission, it's sure to come either way.”  Rachel pursued her knitting, in severe melancholy.  “Won't you have another piece of pudding, Timothy?” asked Mrs. Crump.  “I don't care if I do, Mary, it's so good,” said the cooper, passing his plate. “Seems to me it's the best pudding you ever made.”  “You've got a good appetite, that is all,” said Mrs. Crump, modestly.  “By the way, Mary,” said the cooper, with a sudden thought, “I quite forgot that I have something for you.”  “For me?”  “Yes, from Mr. Merriam.”  “But he don't know me,” said Mrs. Crump, in surprise.  “At any rate, he asked me if I were married, and then handed me this envelope for you. I am not quite sure whether I ought to allow gentlemen to write letters to my wife.”  Mrs. Crump opened the envelope with considerable curiosity, and uttered an exclamation of surprise, as a bank-note fluttered to the carpet.  “By gracious, mother,” said Jack, springing to get it, “you're in luck. It's a hundred dollar bill.”  “So it is, I declare,” said Mrs. Crump, joyfully. “But, Timothy, it isn't mine. It belongs to you.”  “No, Mary, it shall be yours. I'll put it in the Savings Bank for you.”  “Merriam's a trump, and no mistake,” said Jack. “By the way, father, when you see him again, won't you just insinuate that you have a son? Ain't we in luck, Aunt Rachel?”  “'Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall,'”  said Rachel.  “I never knew Aunt Rachel to be jolly but once,” said Jack, under his breath; “and that was at a funeral.”    CHAPTER VII. EIGHT YEARS. IDA'S PROGRESS.    EIGHT years slipped by, unmarked by any important event. The Crumps were still prosperous in an humble way. The cooper had been able to obtain work most of the time, and this, with the annual remittance for little Ida, had enabled the family not only to live in comfort, but even to save up one hundred and fifty dollars a year. They might even have saved more, living as frugally as they were accustomed to do, but there was one point upon which none of them would consent to be economical. The little Ida must have everything she wanted. Timothy brought home daily some little delicacy for her, which none of the rest thought of sharing. While Mrs."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4660"],["title","Timothy Crump's Ward: A Story of American Life (#5)"],["body"," Crump, far enough from vanity, always dressed with exceeding plainness, Ida's attire was always rich and tasteful. She would sometimes ask, “Mother, why don't you buy yourself some of the pretty things you get for me?”  Mrs. Crump would answer, smiling, “Oh, I'm an old woman, Ida. Plain things are best for me.”  “No, I'm sure you're not old, mother. You don't wear a cap.”  But Mrs. Crump would always playfully evade the child's questions.  Had Ida been an ordinary child, all this petting would have had an injurious effect upon her mind. But, fortunately she had that rare simplicity, young as she was, which lifted her above the dangers to which many might have been subjected. Instead of being made vain, she only felt grateful for the many kindnesses bestowed upon her by her father and mother and brother Jack, as she was wont to call them. Indeed, it had not been thought best to let her know that such was not the relation in which they really stood to her.  There was one point, more important than dress, in which Ida profited by the indulgence of her friends.  “Wife,” the cooper was wont to say, “Ida is a sacred charge in our hands. If we allow her to grow up ignorant, or afford her only ordinary advantages, we shall not fulfil our duty. We have the means, through Providence, to give her some of those advantages which she would enjoy if she remained in that sphere to which her parents, doubtless, belong. Let no unwise parsimony, on our part, withhold them from her.”  “You are right, Timothy,” said Mrs. Crump; “right, as you always are. Follow the dictates of your own heart, and fear not that I shall disapprove.”  Accordingly Ida was, from the first, sent to a carefully-selected private school, where she had the advantage of good associates, and where her progress was astonishingly rapid.  She early displayed a remarkable taste for drawing. As soon as this was discovered, her foster parents took care that she should have abundant opportunity for cultivating it. A private master was secured, who gave her daily lessons, and boasted everywhere of his charming little pupil, whose progress, as he assured her friends, exceeded anything he had ever before known.  Nothing could exceed the cooper's gratification when, on his birthday, Ida presented him with a beautifully-drawn sketch of his wife's placid and benevolent face.  “When did you do it, Ida?” he asked, after earnest expressions of admiration.  “I did it in odd minutes,” she said; “in the evening.”  “But how could you do it without any one of us knowing what you were about?”  “I had a picture before me, and you thought I was copying it, but whenever I could do it without being noticed, I looked up at mother as she sat at her sewing, and so, after awhile, I made this picture.”  “And a fine one it is,” said Timothy, admiringly.  Mrs. Crump insisted that Ida had flattered her, but this the child would not admit. “I couldn't make it look as good as you, mother,” she said. “I tried to, but somehow I couldn't succeed as well as I wanted to.”  “You wouldn't have that difficulty with Aunt Rachel,” said Jack, roguishly.  Ida, with difficulty, suppressed a laugh.  “I see,” said Aunt Rachel, with severe resignation, “that you've taken to ridiculing your poor aunt again. But it's what I expect. I don't never expect any consideration in this house. I was born to be a martyr, and I expect I shall fulfil my destiny. If my own relations laugh at me, of course I can't expect anything better from other folks. But I sha'n't be long in the way. I've had a cough for some time past, and I expect I'm in a consumption.”  “You make too much of a little thing, Rachel,” said the cooper. “I don't think Jack meant anything.”  “I'm sure, what I said was complimentary,” said Jack.  Rachel shook her head incredulously.  “Yes it was. Ask Ida. Why won't you draw Aunt Rachel, Ida? I think she'd make a capital picture.”  “So I will,” said Ida, hesitatingly, “if she will let me.”  “Now, Aunt Rachel, there's a chance for you,” said Jack. “I advise you to improve it. When it's finished, it can be hung up at the Art Rooms, and who knows but you may secure a husband by it?”  “I wouldn't marry,” said his aunt, firmly compressing her lips, “not if anybody'd go down on their knees to me.”  “Now I am sure, Aunt Rachel, that's cruel in you.”  “There ain't any man that I'd trust my happiness to.”  “She hasn't any to trust,” observed Jack, _sotto voce_.  “They're all deceivers,” pursued Rachel, “the best of 'em. You can't believe what one of 'em says. It would be a great deal better if people never married at all.”  “Then where would the world be a hundred years hence?” suggested her nephew.  “Come to an end, most likely,” said Aunt Rachel; “and I don't know but that would be the best thing. It's growing more and more wicked every day.”  It will be seen that no great change has come over Miss Rachel Crump during the years that have intervened. She takes the same disheartening view of human nature and the world's prospects, as ever. Nevertheless, her own hold upon the world seems as strong as ever. Her appetite continues remarkably good, and although she frequently expresses herself to the effect that there is little use in living, probably she would be as unwilling to leave the world as any one. I am not sure that she does not derive as much enjoyment from her melancholy as other people from their cheerfulness. Unfortunately, her peculiar way of enjoying herself is calculated to have rather a depressing influence upon the spirits of those with whom she comes in contact--always excepting Jack, who has a lively sense of the ludicrous, and never enjoys himself better than in bantering his aunt.  Ida is no less a favorite with Jack than with the other members of the household. Rough as he is sometimes, Jack is always gentle with Ida. When she was just learning to walk, and in her helplessness needed the constant care of others, he used, from choice, to relieve his mother of much of the task of amusing the child. He had never had a little sister, and the care of a child as young as Ida was a novelty to him. It was, perhaps, this very office of guardian to the child, assumed when she was so young, that made him feel ever after as if she was placed under his special protection.  And Ida was equally attached to Jack. She learned to look up to him for assistance in anything which she had at heart, and he never disappointed her. Whenever he could, he would accompany her to school, holding her by the hand; and fond as he was of rough play, nothing would induce him to leave her.  “How long have you been a nurse-maid?” asked a boy, older than himself, one day.  Jack's fingers itched to get hold of his derisive questioner, but he had a duty to perform, and contented himself with saying, “Just wait a few minutes, and I'll let you know.”  “I dare say,” was the reply. “I rather think I shall have to wait till both of us are gray before that time.”  “You won't have to wait long before you are black and blue,” retorted Jack.  “Don't mind what he says, Jack,” whispered Ida, fearful lest he should leave her.  “Don't be afraid, Ida; I won't leave you; I guess he won't trouble us another day.”  Meanwhile the boy, emboldened by Jack's passiveness, followed, with more abuse of the same sort. If he had been wiser, he would have seen a storm gathering in the flash of Jack's eye; but he mistook the cause of his forbearance.  The next day, as they were again going to school, Ida saw the same boy dodging round the corner, with his head bound up.  “What's the matter with him, Jack?” she asked.  “I licked him like blazes, that's all,” said Jack, quietly.  “I guess he'll let us alone after this.”    CHAPTER VIII. A STRANGE VISITOR.    IT was about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Mrs. Crump was in the kitchen, busy in preparations for dinner, when a loud knock was heard at the door.  “Who can it be?” ejaculated Mrs. Crump. “Aunt Rachel, there's somebody at the door; won't you be kind enough to see who it is?”  “People have no business to call at such an hour in the morning,”  grumbled Aunt Rachel, as she laid down her knitting reluctantly, and rose from her seat. “Nobody seems to have any consideration for anybody else. But that's the way of the world.”  Opening the outer door, she saw before her a tall woman, dressed in a gown of some dark stuff, with marked, and not altogether pleasant features.  “Are you the lady of the house?” inquired the visitor.  “There ain't any ladies in this house,” said Rachel. “You've come to the wrong place. We have to work for a living here.”  “The woman of the house, then. It doesn't make any difference about names. Are you the one I want to see?”  “No, I ain't,” said Rachel, shortly.  “Will you lead me to your mistress, then?”  “I have none.”  The visitor's eyes flashed, as if her temper was easily roused.  “I want to see Mrs. Crump,” she said, impatiently. “Will you call her, or shall I go and announce myself?”  “Some folks are mighty impatient,” muttered Rachel. “Stay here, and I'll call her to the door.”  In a short time Mrs. Crump presented herself.  “Won't you come in?” she asked, pleasantly.  “I don't care if I do,” was the reply. “I wish to speak to you on important business.”  Mrs. Crump, whose interest was excited, led the way into the sitting-room.  “You have in your family,” said the stranger, after seating herself, “a girl named Ida.”  Mrs. Crump looked up suddenly and anxiously. Could it be that the secret of Ida's birth was to be revealed at last!  “Yes,” she said.  “Who is not your child.”  “But _whom_ I love as such; whom I have always taught to look upon me as a mother.”  “I presume so. It is of her that I wish to speak to you.”  “Do you know anything of her parentage?” inquired Mrs. Crump, eagerly.  “I was her nurse,” said the other, quietly.  Mrs. Crump examined, anxiously, the hard features of the woman. It was a relief at least to know, though she could hardly have believed, that there"]]]
