This course we felt moved upon by the Spirit to adopt; but they kept at a respectful distance, and only came out when we were absent, with misrepresentations and abuse. It is true we suffered some from the statements which they thought proper to make, when we could get no opportunity to contradict them; but generally their reports were of such a character that they carried along with them their own refutation.  The time when we expected to return to our native land, having now nearly arrived, it was thought necessary to spend the short time we had to remain in that country in visiting and organizing the churches; placing such officers over them, and giving such instructions as would be beneficial to them during our absence. Accordingly, Brothers Hyde, Fielding and I entered upon this duty, and we visited a Church nearly every day, and imparted such instructions as the Spirit directed. We first visited the Churches south of Preston, and after spending some time in that direction we journeyed to the north, accompanied by Brother Richards, who had just returned from the city of Bedford.  While we were attending to our duties in that section, we received a very pressing invitation from a Baptist church, through the medium of their deacon, to pay them a visit, stating that the society was exceedingly anxious to hear from our own lips, the wonderful things we had proclaimed in the regions round about.  We endeavored to excuse ourselves from going, as our engagements already were such that it would require the short time we had to stay to attend to them. But they seemed determined to take no denial, and plead with us with such earnestness that we could not resist their entreaties, and finally we consented to go and preach once.  Having arrived at the place, we found a large congregation already assembled in the Baptist chapel, anxiously awaiting our arrival. The minister gave out the hymns for us, and Elder Hyde spoke on the subject of the resurrection with great effect; after which the minister gave out another hymn which was sung by the assembly, and then he requested me to address them. I arose and spoke briefly on the first principles of the gospel.  During the services the congregation were overjoyed, the tears ran down their cheeks, and the minister could not refrain from frequently clapping his hands together for joy while in the meeting. After the service was over he took us to his house, where we were very kindly entertained. After partaking of his hospitality he with some more friends, accompanied us to our lodgings, where we remained in conversation until a very late hour.  The next morning while we were preparing to depart we were waited upon by several of the citizens, who requested us to preach again that day, stating that great interest was felt by the inhabitants, many of whom were in tears, fearing they should hear us no more; and that a number of influential men, had suspended operations in their factories, to allow their workmen the privilege of hearing us preach. But we were obliged to deny them, as it was necessary to attend to the appointments we had previously made. We could scarcely tear ourselves away from them, and when we did so they wept like little children. Such a desire to hear the gospel, I never saw equalled before.  After commending them to the grace and mercy of God, we went to Downham, where we preached in the afternoon, after which forty came forward and were baptized. In the evening we called the churches of Chatburn and Downham together, and after confirming forty-five who had previously been baptized, we appointed priests, teachers and deacons to preside over them.    CHAPTER VI.  IMPRESSED TO VISIT DOWNHAM AND CHATBURN--BAD CHARACTER OF THOSE PLACES--WARNED AGAINST GOING--JOY WITH WHICH THE GOSPEL WAS RECEIVED--THE PEOPLE EAGER TO BE BAPTIZED--LOTH TO PART WITH ME--VAIN OPPOSITION FROM A MINISTER--AFFECTING CONDUCT OF LITTLE CHILDREN.  There being something interesting in the establishing of the gospel in Downham and Chatburn, I will relate the circumstances of my visit to those places, and the prospect we had of success prior to our proclaiming the truth to them.  Having been preaching in the neighborhood of these villages, I felt it my duty to pay them a visit and tell them my mission. I mentioned my desires to several of the brethren, but they endeavored to dissuade me from going, informing me that there could be no prospect of success, as several ministers of different denominations had endeavored to raise churches in these places, and had frequently preached to them, but to no effect. They had resisted all the efforts and withstood the attempts of all sects and parties for thirty years, and the preachers had given them up to the hardness of their hearts. I was also informed that they were very wicked places and the inhabitants were hardened against the gospel.  However, this did not discourage me in the least, believing that the gospel of Jesus Christ could reach the heart when the gospels of men were found abortive. I consequently told those who tried to dissuade me from going that these were the places I wanted to go to, and that it was my business \"not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"  Accordingly I went in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I soon procured a large barn to preach in, which was crowded to excess. Having taken my stand in the middle of the congregation so that all might be able to hear, I commenced my discourse, spoke with great simplicity on the subject of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the conditions of pardon for a fallen world, and the privileges and blessings of all those who embraced the truth. I likewise said a little on the subject of the resurrection.  My remarks were accompanied by the spirit of the Lord and were received with joy, and these people, who were represented as being so hard and obdurate, were melted with tenderness and love, and such a feeling was produced as I never saw before; and the effect seemed to be general.  I then told them that, being a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, I stood ready at all times to administer the ordinances of the gospel. After I had concluded, I felt some one pulling at my coat. I turned around and asked the person what it was he desired. The answer was \"Please, sir, will you baptize me?\" \"and me!\" \"and me!\" exclaimed more than a dozen voices.  We accordingly went down into the water, and before I left, I baptized twenty-five for the remission of sins--and was thus engaged until four o'clock the next morning.  Another evening the congregation was so numerous that I had to preach in the open air, and took my stand on a stone wall, and afterwards baptized a number.  These towns seemed to be affected from one end to the other; parents called their children together, spoke to them of the subjects upon which I had preached, and warned them against swearing and all other evil practices, and instructed them in their duty, etc. Such a scene I presume was never witnessed in this place before; the hearts of the people appeared to be broken, and the next morning they were all in tears, thinking they should see my face no more. When I left them my feelings were such as I cannot describe. As I walked down the street, followed by numbers, the doors were crowded by the inmates of the houses, waiting to bid us a last farewell, who could only give vent to their grief in sobs and broken accents.  While contemplating this scene we were induced to take off our hats, for we felt as if the place was holy ground. The Spirit of the Lord rested down upon us, and I was constrained to bless that whole region of country.  We were followed a considerable distance from the villages by a great number, who could hardly separate themselves from us. My heart was like unto theirs, and I almost thought my head was a fountain of tears, for I wept for several miles after I bid them adieu.  Some things transpired while I was in England which may be considered of but little importance by the world, but which will no doubt be appreciated by the Saints, who can not only mark the providence of God as displayed in nations and kingdoms, but can observe its workings in private life, and in affairs of but apparent small moment.  Soon after our arrival in England a great many of the \"Aikenites\" embraced the gospel, which caused considerable ill feeling and opposition among the ministers belonging to that sect.  Having lost quite a number, and seeing that many more were on the eve of being baptized, one of the ministers came to Preston and announced that he was going to put down \"Mormonism,\" expose the doctrines and overthrow the Book of Mormon. He made a very long oration on the subject, and was very vehement in his manner, and pounded the Book of Mormon, which he held in his hand, on the pulpit a great many times. He then exhorted the people to pray that the Lord would drive us from their coasts, and if the Lord would not hear them in that petition, that he would smite the leaders.  The next Sunday Elder Hyde and I, being in Preston, went to our meeting and read the 13th chapter of Corinthians. We strongly urged upon the Saints the grace of charity, which is so highly spoken of in that chapter, and took the liberty of making some remarks on the proceedings of Mr. Aiken, the gentleman who had abused us and the Book of Mormon so very much a few days before. In return for his railing, we exhorted our people to pray that the Lord would soften his heart and open his eyes, that he might see that it was \"hard to kick against the pricks.\"  The discourse had a very good effect, and that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],["title","President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#7)"],["body","we had the pleasure of baptizing about fifty into the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a large number of whom were members of Mr. Aiken's church.  Thus the Lord blessed us exceedingly, notwithstanding the railing and abuse of the priests, and all things worked together for our good and the advancement of the cause of truth.  I cannot refrain from relating a circumstance which took place, while Brother Fielding and I were passing through the village of Chatburn; having been observed drawing nigh to the town, the news ran from house to house, and immediately on our arrival, the noise of their looms was hushed, the people flocked to the doors to welcome us, and see us pass. The youth of the place ran to meet us, and took hold of our mantles and then of each other's hands. Several, having hold of hands, went before us, singing the songs of Zion, while their parents gazed upon the scene with delight, poured out their blessings upon our heads, and praised the God of heaven for sending us to unfold the principles of truth and the plan of salvation to them.  Such a scene, and such gratitude, I never witnessed before. \"Surely,\" my heart exclaimed, \"out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, thou has perfected praise!\"  What could have been more pleasing and delightful than such a manifestation of gratitude to Almighty God from those whose hearts were deemed too hard to be penetrated by the gospel, and who had been considered the most wicked and hardened people in that region of country!  In comparison to the joy I then experienced, the grandeur, pomp and glory of the kingdoms of this world shrank into insignificance and appeared as dross, and all the honor of man, aside from the gospel, to be vain.    CHAPTER VII.  VISIT TO THE MOON FAMILY--PREJUDICED AGAINST OUR DOCTRINE--A PROPHECY ABOUT THEM--IMPRESSED TO CALL AT THEIR HOUSE AGAIN--MY PRESENCE HAILED WITH JOY AS AN ANSWER TO PRAYER--THE PROPHECY FULFILLED: THEY JOIN THE CHURCH--A DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION.  Having an appointment to preach in the village of Wrightington, while on the way I stopped at the house of Brother Amos Fielding. When I arrived he informed me that a certain family by the name of Moon had sent a request by him for me to visit them, that they might have the privilege of conversing with me on the subject of the gospel. Accordingly, Brother Fielding and I paid them a visit that evening.  We were very kindly received by the family, and had considerable conversation on the object of my mission to that country, and the great work of the last days. They listened with attention to my statements, but they appeared to be prejudiced against them rather than otherwise. We remained in conversation until a late hour, and then returned.  On our way home, Brother Fielding observed that he thought our visit had been in vain, as the family seemed to have considerable prejudice. I replied, \"Brother Fielding, be not faithless, but believing; we shall yet see great effects from this visit, for I know there are some of the family who have received the testimony and will shortly manifest the same.\"  At this remark he appeared surprised.  The next morning I continued my journey to Wrightington, and after spending two or three days in that vicinity, preaching the gospel, I returned by the way of Brother Fielding's, with whom I again tarried for the night.  The next morning I commenced my journey, intending to go direct to Preston, but when I got opposite the road leading to Mr. Moon's, I was forcibly impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to call and see them again. I could not resist, and therefore directed my steps to the house, not knowing what it meant.  On my arrival at the house, I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Moon from within exclaimed, \"Come in! come in! you are welcome here! I and the lasses (meaning her daughters) have just been calling on the Lord, and praying that He would send you this way.\"  She then informed me of her state of mind since I was there before, and said she at first rejected my testimony, and endeavored to think lightly of the things I had advanced, but on trying to pray, she said that \"the heavens seemed to be like brass over her head, and it was like iron under her feet.\" She did not know what was the matter, and exclaimed, \"Certainly the man has not bewitched me!\"  Upon inquiry she found it was the same with the \"lasses.\" They had begun to reflect on the things I had told them, and, thinking it possible that I had told them the truth, they resolved to lay the case before the Lord, and beseech Him to give them a testimony concerning the things I had testified of.  She then observed, that as soon as they did so, light broke in upon their minds, they were convinced that I was a messenger of salvation, and that it was the work of the Lord; and they had resolved to obey the gospel, which they did, for that evening I baptized father and mother and four of their daughters.  Shortly after I visited them again, and baptized the remainder of the family, consisting of thirteen souls, the youngest of whom was over twenty years of age. They received the gospel as little children, and rejoiced exceedingly in its blessings. The sons were very good musicians, and the daughters excellent singers, and when they united their instruments and their voices in the songs of Zion, the effect was truly transporting.  Before I left England, there were about thirty of that family and connections baptized, six of whom were ordained to be fellow-laborers with us in the vineyard, and I left them rejoicing in the truths they had embraced.  One night, while at the village of Rochester, I dreamed that I, in company with another person, was walking out, and saw a very extensive field of wheat, more so than the eye could reach. Such a sight I never before witnessed. The wheat appeared to be perfectly ripe, and ready for harvest. I was very much rejoiced at the glorious sight which presented itself; but judge of my surprise, when, on taking some of the ears and rubbing them in my hands, I found nothing but smut. I marveled exceedingly, and felt very sorrowful, and exclaimed, \"What will the people do for grain; here is a great appearance of plenty, but there is no sound wheat!\"  While contemplating the subject, I looked in another direction, and saw a small field in the form of the letter L, which had the appearance of something growing in it. I immediately directed my steps to it, and found that it had been sown with wheat, some of which had grown about six inches high, other parts of the field not quite so high, and some had only just sprouted. This gave me great encouragement to expect that at the harvest there would be some good grain. While thus engaged, a large bull, very fierce and angry, leaped over the fence, ran through the field, and stamped down a large quantity of that which had just sprouted, and after doing considerable injury he leaped over the fence and ran away.  I felt very much grieved, that so much wheat should be destroyed, when there was such a prospect of scarcity. When I awoke next morning, the interpretation was given me. The large field with the great appearance of grain, so beautiful to look upon, represented the nation in which I then resided, which had a very pleasing appearance and a great show of religion, and made great pretensions to piety and godliness, but denied the power thereof. It was destitute of the principles of truth, and consequently of the gifts of the spirit.  The small field I saw clearly represented the region of country where I was laboring, and where the word of truth had taken root, and was growing in the hearts of those who had the gospel, some places having grown a little more than others. The village I was in, was that part of the field where the bull did so much injury, for during my short visit there, most of the inhabitants were believing, but as soon as I departed, a clergyman belonging to the church of England, came out and violently attacked the truth, and made considerable noise, crying, \"false prophet! delusion!\" and after trampling on truth, and doing all the mischief he could, before I returned, he took shelter in his pulpit. However, he did not destroy all the seed, for after my return I was instrumental in building up a church in that place.    CHAPTER VIII.  EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS--VERY COLD WEATHER--SCENES OF SUFFERING--OUR EXCESSIVE LABORS--A GENERAL CONFERENCE--FAREWELL MEETING--AFFECTION MANIFESTED FOR US--ELDER RUSSELL'S LABORS--ELDER GOODSON A BARRIER.  It being known that we had but a short time to remain in that country, great numbers flocked to hear us preach, and many were baptized. Some days we went from house to house, conversing with the people on the things of the kingdom, and by such a course were instrumental in convincing many of the truth. I have known as many as twenty persons baptized in one day who have been convinced on such occasions. They were like Lydia of old, \"who gladly received the word.\" I have had to go into the water to administer the ordinance of baptism six or seven times in a day, and frequently after having come out of the water and changed my clothes, I have had to return again before I reached my home; this, too, when the weather was extremely cold, the ice being from twelve to fourteen inches thick, which continued so about twelve weeks, during which time I think there were but ten days, in which we were not in the water. \"The harvest was indeed plenteous but the laborers were few.\" This was very extraordinary weather for that country; as I was informed that some winters they had scarcely any frost or snow, and the oldest inhabitants told me that they never experienced such a winter before. In consequence of the inclemency of the weather, several manufacturing establishments were shut up, children were thrown out of employment, whose sufferings during that time were severe, and I was credibly informed, and verily believe, that numbers perished from starvation.
