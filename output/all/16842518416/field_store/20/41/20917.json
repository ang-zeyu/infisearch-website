[_The Nibelungs come up out of the cleft laden with         the objects of which the hoard is composed._  ALBERICH        O bitter disgrace       That my shrinking bondsmen   Should see me captive and bound!          [_To the Nibelungs._        Lay it down there,       As ye are bid!       In a heap       Pile up the hoard.       Must I aid, idlers?       No spying at me!       Haste there! Haste!       Then get ye gone quickly.       Hence to your work.       Home to your gorges!   Let the sluggards beware,   For I follow hard at your heels!          [_He kisses the ring and holds it out with an air         of command. As struck with a blow, the Nibelungs         press terrified and cowering towards the cleft,         down which they hastily disappear._  ALBERICH        The price is paid;       Let me depart!       And that helm of mine       Which Loge still holds,   That also pray give me again!  LOGE          _Throwing the Tarnhelm on to the heap._    The plunder must pay for the pardon.  ALBERICH        Accursed thief!       But patience! Calm!       He who moulded the one       Makes me another;       Still mine is the might       That Mime obeys.       Loath indeed       Am I to leave   My cunning defence to the foe!       Nothing Alberich       Owns at all now;   Unbind, ye tyrants, his bonds!  LOGE [_To Wotan._        Ought I to free him?       Art thou content?  WOTAN        A golden ring       Girdles thy finger:       Hearest, elf?   That also belongs to the hoard.  ALBERICH  [_Horrified._        The ring?  WOTAN       The ring must also      Go to the ransom.  ALBERICH [_Trembling._       My life--but the ring: not that!  WOTAN [_With greater violence._        The ring I covet;   For thy life I care not at all.  ALBERICH    But if my life I ransom   The ring I must also rescue       Hand and head,       Eye and ear   Are not mine more truly   Than mine is the ruddy ring!  WOTAN    The ring thou claimest as thine?   Impudent elf, thou art raving.       Tell the truth;       Whence was gotten the gold   To fashion the glittering gaud?       How could that be       Thine which reft was,   Thou rogue, from watery deeps?       To the Rhine's fair daughters       Down and inquire       If the gold       Was as gift to thee given   That thou didst thieve for the ring!  ALBERICH        Vile double-dealing!       Shameless deceit!       Wouldst thou, robber,       Reproach in me   The sin so sweet to thyself?       How fain thou hadst   Bereft the Rhine of its gold,       If it had been   As easy to forge as to steal!       How well for thee,       Thou unctuous knave,       That the Nibelung, stung       By shameful defeat,       And by fury driven,   Was fired into winning the spell   That now alluringly smiles!       Shall I, bliss debarred,       Anguish-burdened       Because of the       Curse-laden deed,       My ring as a toy   Grant to princes for pleasure,   My ban bringing blessing to thee?       Have a care,       Arrogant God!       My sin was one   Concerning myself alone:   But against all that was,       Is and shall be   Thou wouldst wantonly sin,   Eternal one, taking the ring.  WOTAN        Yield the ring!       Thy foolish talk   Gives no title to that.          [_He seizes Alberich and draws the ring from his         finger by force._  ALBERICH  [_With a frightful cry._      Woe! Defeated! Undone!     Of wretches the wretchedest slave!  WOTAN [_Contemplating the ring._      I own what makes me supreme,     The mightiest lord of all lords!          [_He puts on the ring._  LOGE [_To Wotan._      Shall he go free?  WOTAN      Loose his bonds.  LOGE [_Sets Alberich quite free._        Slip away home,       For no fetter binds thee!   Fare forth, thou art free!  ALBERICH [_Raising himself with furious laughter._        Am I now free,       Free in truth?       My freedom's first   Greeting take, for it is thine!   As a curse gave me the ring,   My curse go with the ring!       As its gold   Gave measureless might,       May now its magic   Deal death evermore!       No man shall gain       Gladness therefrom;       May ill-fortune befall him       On whom it shines.       Fretted by care       Be he who shall hold it,       And he who doth not,       By envy be gnawed!       All shall covet       And crave its wealth,       Yet none shall it profit       Or pay when won.   Those who guard it nothing shall gain,   Yet shall murder go where they go.       The coward, death-doomed,   By fetters of fear shall be bound;       His whole life long   He shall languish to death--       The ring's proud lord       And its poorest slave--       Till again I have   In my hand the gold I was robbed of.       So blesses       The Nibelung   The ring in bitter despair!       Hold fast to it!          [Laughing.      Keep it with care;          [Grimly.      From my curse none shall escape!

WOTAN [_Left in contemplation of the ring._    Grudge him not vent to his spleen!          [_It keeps growing lighter._  LOGE [_Looking to the right._        Fasolt and Fafner       Come from afar   Bringing Freia again.          [_Through the vanishing mist Donner, Froh, and         Fricka appear, and hasten towards the foreground._  FROH        The giants return.  DONNER        Be greeted, brother!  FRICKA [_Anxiously to Wotan._        Dost bring joyful tidings?  LOGE [_Pointing to the hoard._        By fraud and by force       We have prevailed:   There Freia's ransom lies.  DONNER        From the giant's grasp       Freed comes the fair one.  FROH        How sweetly the air       Fans us again!       Balmy delights       Steal soft through each sense!   Sad, forlorn had our lot been,   For ever severed from her   Who gives us youth everlasting,   And bliss triumphant o'er pain.          [_Fasolt and Fafner enter, leading Freia between         them. Fricka hastens joyfully towards her sister.         The foreground has become quite bright again, the         light restoring to the aspect of the Gods its         original freshnesh. The background, however, is         still veiled by the mist so that the distant castle         remains invisible._  FRICKA        Sweetest of sisters!       Lovely delight!   Once more for mine have I won thee!  FASOLT [_Keeping her off_        Hold! Touch her not yet!       Freia still is ours.       On Riesenheim's       Rampart of rock       Resting we stayed.       The pledge we held       In our hands we used       Loyally.       With deep regret,       I bring her back now       In case ye brothers       Can ransom her.  WOTAN    Prepared lies the ransom;       Mete out the gold,   Giving generous measure.  FASOLT        In truth it grieves me   Greatly the woman to lose;   And that my heart may forget her       Ye must heap the hoard,       Pile it so high       That it shall hide   The blossom-sweet maid from mine eyes!  WOTAN        Be Freia's form       The gauge of the gold.          [_Freia is placed in the middle by the two giants,         who then stick their staves into the ground in         front of her so that her height and breadth is         indicated._  FAFNER         Our staves give the measure        Of Freia's form;    Thus high now heap ye the hoard.  WOTAN        On with the work:       Irksome I find it!  LOGE        Help me, Froh!  FROH        I will end       Freia's dishonour.          [_Loge and Froh heap up the treasure hastily         between the staves._  FAFNER        Let the pile       Less loosely be built;       Firm and close       Pack ye the gauge!          [_He presses down the treasure with rude strength;         he bends down to look for gaps._        I still can see through;       Come, fill up the crannies!  LOGE        Hands off, rude fellow!       Touch nothing here!  FAFNER    Come here! This gap must be closed!  WOTAN [_Turning away angrily._        Deep in my breast       Burns the disgrace!  FRICKA        See how in shame   Beautiful Freia stands;       For release she asks,   Dumb, with sorrowful eyes.       Heartless man!   The lovely one owes this to thee!  FAFNER        Still more! Pile on still more.  DONNER        My patience fails;       Mad is the wrath   Roused by this insolent rogue!       Come hither, hound!       Measure must thou?   Thy strength then measure with mine!  FAFNER        Softly, Donner!       Roar where it serves;   Thy roar is impotent here.  DONNER [_Lunging out at him._        It will crush thee to thy cost, rogue.  WOTAN        Calm thyself!   Methinks that Freia is hid.  LOGE        The hoard is spent.  FAFNER          [_Measures the hoard carefully with his eye, and         looks to see if there are any crevices._    Still shines to me Holda's hair.       Yonder thing, too,       Throw on the hoard!  LOGE        Even the helm?  FAFNER        Make haste! Here with it!  WOTAN        Let it go also!  LOGE [_Throws the Tarnhelm on the heap._        At last we have finished.       Have ye enough now?  FASOLT        Freia, the fair,       Is hidden for aye!       The price has been paid.       Ah, have I lost her?          [_He goes up to the hoard and peers through it._        Sadly shine       Her eyes on me still,       Like stars they beam       Softly on me;       Still through this chink       I look on their light.          [_Beside himself._    While her sweet eyes I behold thus,   From the woman how can I part?  FAFNER        Hey! Come hither,       And stop me this cranny!  LOGE        Greedy grumblers!       Can ye not see   The gold is all gone?  FAFNER        Not the whole, friend!       On Wotan's finger   Shines a golden ring still;   Give that to close up the crevice!  WOTAN        What!

[Illustration: Plate 14     FAFNER.     \"Hey! Come hither,      And stop me this cranny!\"]  WOTAN        What nonsense is this?   The ring I won so hardly,   Undismayed I hold and will keep.  LOGE        Broken then       Must be the promise   I gave the maidens who grieved.  WOTAN      By thy promise I am not bound;     As booty mine is the ring.  FAFNER        Not so. The ring   Must go with the ransom.  WOTAN    Boldly ask what ye will:       It shall be granted;       But not for all   The world would I give you the ring.  FASOLT [_Furious, pulls Freia from behind the hoard._        All is off!       The bargain stands:   Fair Freia ours is for ever!  FREIA      Help me! Help me!  FRICKA      Heartless God,     Grant it! Give way!  FROH      Keep not the gold back!  DONNER      Give them the ring too!  WOTAN      Let me alone!     I hold to the ring.          [_Fafner stops Fasolt as he is hastening off. All         stand dismayed; Wotan turns from them in anger. The         stage has grown dark again. From a cleft in the         rock on one side issues a bluish flame in which         Erda suddenly becomes visible, rising so that her         upper half is seen._  ERDA [_Stretching out a warning hand towards Wotan._    Yield it, Wotan! Yield it!   Flee the ring's dread curse!       Awful       And utter disaster   It will doom thee to.  WOTAN    What woman woe thus foretells?  ERDA    All things that were I know,       And things that are;       All things that shall be       I foresee.       The endless world's       Ur-Wala,   Erda, bids thee beware.       Ere the earth was,       Of my womb born       Were daughters three;       And my knowledge   Nightly the Norns tell to Wotan.       Now summoned by       Danger most dire,       I myself come.   Hearken! Hearken! Hearken!   All things will end shortly;       And for the Gods       Dark days are dawning!   Be counselled; keep not the ring!          [_Erda sinks slowly as far as the breast, while the         bluish light grows fainter._  WOTAN        A mystic might       Rang in thy words.   Tarry, and tell me further.  ERDA [_Disappearing._        Thou hast been warned;       Enough dost know;   Weigh my words with fear!          [_She vanishes completely._  [Illustration: Plate 15, \"Erda bids thee beware\"]  WOTAN    If thus doomed to foreboding--       I must detain thee       Till all is answered!          [_Wotan is about to follow Erda in order to detain         her. Froh and Fricka throw themselves in his way         and prevent him._  FRICKA      What meanest thou, madman?  FROH      Go not, Wotan!     Fear thou the warner,     Heed her words well!          [_Wotan gazes thoughtfully before him._  DONNER [_Turning to the giants with a resolute air._        Hark, ye giants!       Come back and wait still!   The gold we give you also.  FRICKA        Ah, dare I hope it?       Deem ye Holda   Worthy of such a price?          [_All look at Wotan in suspense; he, rousing         himself from deep thought, grasps his spear and         swings it in token of having come to a bold         decision._  WOTAN        To me, Freia,       For thou art free!       Bought back for aye,   Youth everlasting, return!   Here, giants, take ye the ring!          [He throws the ring on the hoard. The giants         release Freia; she hastens joyfully to the Gods,         who caress her in turns for a space, with every         manifestation of delight.  FASOLT [_To Fafner._        Hold there, greedy one!       Grant me my portion!       Honest division       Best for both is.  FAFNER    More on the maid than the gold   Thou wert set, love-sick fool,       And much against       Thy will the exchange was.       Sharing not, Freia   Thou wouldst have wooed for thy bride;       Sharing the gold,       It is but just   That the most of it should be mine.  FASOLT        Infamous thief!       Taunts? And to me!          [_To the Gods._    Come judge ye between us;       Halve ye the hoard       As seems to you just!          [_Wotan turns away in contempt._        Let him have the treasure;       Hold to what matters: the ring!  FASOLT          [_Falls upon Fafner, who has meanwhile been         steadily packing up the treasure._        Back, brazen rascal!       Mine is the ring.   I lost for it Freia's smile.          [_He snatches haply at the ring._        Off with thy hands!       The ring is mine.          [_There is a struggle. Fasolt tears the ring from         Fafner._  FASOLT        I hold it. It is mine now!  FAFNER        Hold fast, lest it should fall!          [_Lunging out with his stave, he fells Fasolt to         the ground with one blow; from the dying man he         then hastily tears the ring._        Now feast upon Freia's smile:       No more shalt thou touch the ring!          [_He puts the ring into the sack and tranquilly         continues to pack up the rest of the hoard. All the         Gods stand horrified. A solemn silence._  [Illustration: Plate 16, Fafner kills Fasolt.]  WOTAN        Dread indeed   I find is the curse's might.  LOGE        Unmatched, Wotan,       Surely thy luck is!       Great thy gain was       In getting the ring;       But the gain of its loss       Is gain greater still:       There thy foemen, see,       Slaughter thy foes   For the gold thou hast let go.  WOTAN    Dark forebodings oppress me!       Care and fear       Fetter my soul;       Erda must teach me,       Tell how to end them:       To her I must descend.  FRICKA [_Caressing and coaxing him._        Why linger, Wotan?       Beckon they not,       The stately walls,       Waiting to offer   Welcome kind to their lord?  WOTAN [_Gloomily._        With wage accurst       Paid was their cost.  DONNER [_Pointing to the background, which is still        enveloped in mist._        Heavily mists       Hang in the air;       Gloomy, wearisome       Is their weight!       The wan-visaged clouds   Charged with their storms I will gather,   And sweep the blue heavens clean.          [_Donner mounts a high rock on the edge of the         precipice, and swings his hammer; during what         follows the mists gather round him._    Hey da! Hey da! Hey do!       To me, O ye mists!       Ye vapours, to me!       Donner, your lord,       Summons his hosts!          [_He swings his hammer._        To my hammer's swing       Hitherward sweep       Vapours and fogs!       Hovering mists!   Donner, your lord, summons his hosts!       Hey da! Hey da! Hey do!          [_Donner disappears completely in a thunder-cloud         which has been growing darker and denser. The         stroke of his hammer is heard falling heavily on         the rock. A vivid flash of lightning comes from the         cloud, followed by a loud clap of thunder. Froh has         also disappeared in the cloud._  DONNER [_Invisible._        Brother, to me!   Show them the way by the bridge!          [_Suddenly the clouds roll away. Donner and Froh         become visible. A rainbow of dazzling radiance         stretches from their feet across the valley to         the castle, which is gleaming in the light of the         setting sun._  FROH          [_Who, with outstretched hand, indicates to the         Gods that the bridge is the way across the valley._    Lo, light, yet securely,   Leads the bridge to your halls.       Undaunted tread;       Without danger the road!          [_Wotan and the other Gods stand speechless, lost         in contemplation of the glorious sight._  [Illustration: Plate 17         \"To my hammer's swing         Hitherward sweep         Vapours and fogs!         Hovering mists!     Donner, your lord, summons his hosts!\"]  WOTAN        Smiling at eve       The sun's eye sparkles;       The castle ablaze   Gleams fair in its glow.       In the light of morning       Glittering proudly,       It stood masterless,   Stately, tempting its lord.       From dawn until sundown       No little toil   And fear have gone to the winning!       From envious night,       That now draws nigh   Shelter it offers us.          [_Very firmly, as if struck by a great thought._    So greet I my home,   Safe from dismay and dread.          [_He turns solemnly to Fricka._        Follow me, wife!   In Valhall sojourn with me.  FRICKA        What means the name Valhall?   I never seem to have heard it.  WOTAN    That which, conquering fear,       My fortitude brought       Triumphant to birth--   Let that explain the word!          [_He takes Fricka's hand and walks slowly with her         towards the bridge. Froh, Freia, and Donner follow._  LOGE [_Remaining in the foreground and looking        after the Gods._    They are hasting on to their end,   They who dream they are strong and            enduring.       I almost blush       To be of their number;       A fancy allures me       And wakes in me longing   Flaming fire to become:       To waste and burn them       Who tamed me of old,       Rather than perish,       Blind with the blind--       Yes, even if godlike the Gods were--   More wise were it, perhaps!       I must consider:       The outcome who knows!          [_With a show of carelessness he goes to the Gods._  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_From the valley. Invisible._        Rhinegold!       Rhinegold!       Rhinegold pure!       How radiant and clear   Once thou didst shine on us!       For thy lost glory       We are grieving.       Give us the gold!       Give us the gold!   O give us the Rhinegold again!  WOTAN        What wailing sound do I hear?          [_About to set his foot on the bridge, pauses and         turns round._  LOGE [_Looks down into the valley._        The Rhine's fair children,   Bewailing their lost gold, weep.  WOTAN        Accursèd nixies!   Bid them tease us no more!  LOGE [_Calling down towards the valley._        Ye in the water,       Why wail ye to us?   List to Wotan's decree.
