I say that I rejoice in the fact that \"Mormonism\" came into the world, and exists in the world today, because the world stood and stands in sore need of it. But does this re-establishment of the Church of Christ, this new dispensation of the gospel, which we have received, make our relationship to the children of men one of unfriendliness? I answer, No. On the contrary our relationship to men is one of absolute friendliness, and we are anxious to do the world good. We ought to understand that. We do understand it. And it is important that the world should understand it, that they may come to regard us in our true light, as friends of humanity, and not enemies.  If you will look through some of the revelations given in the early history of the church, you will find that from time to time the Lord was under the necessity of correcting the ideas of the brethren respecting their attitude towards religious world. The Lord said to Martin Harris, by of correction:      \"Thou shalt declare glad tidings, yea, publish it upon the     mountains, and upon every high place, and among people that thou     shalt be permitted to see. And thou do it with all humility,     trusting in me, reviling not against revilers. And of tenets thou     shall not talk, but thou shall declare repentance and faith on the     Savior, and remission of sin by baptism and by fire, yea, even the     Holy Ghost.\"  The Prophet also from time to time found it necessary to correct the Elders of the Church in respect of their attacks upon other churches. At Kirtland, in 1836, when many of the Elders were upon the eve of taking their departure for their fields of labor, he instructed them as follows:      \"While waiting [for the Sacrament] I made the following remarks:     The time that we were required to tarry in Kirtland to be endowed     would be fulfilled in a few days, and then the Elders would go     forth, and each stand for himself . . . . to go in all meekness, in     sobriety, and preach Christ and him crucified; not to contend with     others on account of their faith or systems of religion, but pursue     a steady course. This I delivered by way of commandment; and all     who observe it not, will pull down persecution upon their heads,     while those who do, shall always be filled with the Holy Ghost;     this I pronounced as a prophesy.\" [A]  [Footnote A: History of the Church, vol. II, p. 431.]  In other words, because the Lord has opened the heavens and has given a new dispensation of the gospel, it does not follow that his servants or his people are to be contentious; that they are to make war upon other people for holding different views respecting religion. Hence this caution to the Elders of the Church that they should not contend against other churches, make war upon their tenets, or revile even the revilers.  At an earlier date still, the Lord had said to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer:      \"If you have not faith, hope and charity, you can do nothing.     Contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil. Take     upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.\" [A]  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov. Sec. 18, 19-21.]      \"The church of the devil\" here alluded to, I understand to mean     not any particular church among men, or any one sect of religion,     but something larger than that--something that includes within its     boundaries all evil wherever it may be found; as well in schools of     philosophy as in Christian sects; as well in systems of ethics as     in systems of religion--something that includes the whole empire of     Satan--what I shall call \"The Kingdom of Evil.\"  This descriptive phrase, \"the church of the devil,\" is also used in the Book of Mormon; and while in attendance at a conference in one of the border stakes of Zion, a question was propounded to me in relation to its meaning. The passage occurs in the writings of the first Nephi. An angel of the Lord is represented as saying to Nephi, \"Behold, there are save two churches only: the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil.\" The question submitted to me was, \"Is the Catholic church the church here referred to--the church of the devil?\" \"Well,\" said I, in answer, \"I would not like to take that position, because it would leave me with a lot of churches on my hands that I might not then be able to classify.\" So far as the Catholic church is concerned, I believe that there is just as much truth, nay, personally I believe it has retained even more truth than other divisions of so-called Christendom; and there is just as much virtue in the Roman Catholic church as there is in Protestant Christendom; and I am sure there is more strength.  I would not like; therefore, to designate the Catholic church as the church of the devil. Neither would I like to designate any one or all of the various divisions and subdivisions of Protestant Christendom combined as such church; nor the Greek Catholic church; nor the Buddhist sects; nor the followers of Confucius; nor the followers of Mohammed; nor would I like to designate even the societies formed by deists and atheists as constituting the church of the devil. The Book of Mormon text ought to be read in connection with its context--with the chapter that precedes it and the remaining portions of the chapter in which the expression is found--then, I think, those who study it in that manner will be forced to the conclusion that the prophet here has in mind no particular church, no particular division of Christendom, but he has in mind, as just stated, the whole empire of Satan; and perhaps the thought of the passage would be more nearly expressed if we use the term \"the Kingdom of Evil\" as Constituting the church of the devil, in proof of which I submit the following passage from the Book of Mormon---covering both the text and the context on the subject:      1. And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken     unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself     unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the taking     away of their stumbling blocks;      2. And if they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God,     they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father [Lehi; an     Israelite]; yea, they shall be numbered among the house of Israel;     and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land for ever;     they shall be no more brought down into captivity; and the house of     Israel shall no more be confounded;      3. And that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that     great and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his     children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell;     yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the destruction     of men, shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their utter     destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the     soul, save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath no end;      4. For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil, and     also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work     wickedness and abomination before him.      5. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying,     Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well with     them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord     unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard, that whoso     repenteth not, must perish;      6. Therefore, wo, be unto the Gentiles, if it so be that they     harden their hearts against the Lamb of God;      7. For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work     a great and a marvellous work among the children of men; a work     which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other;     either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal,     or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts     and the blindness of their minds, unto their being brought down     into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and     spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I     have spoken.      8. And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words,     he said unto me, Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto     the house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea. And it came to pass that     he said unto me, look, and behold that great and abominable church,     which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation is the devil.     And he said unto me, behold there are, save two churches only; the     one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church     of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the     Lamb of God, belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of     abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.      47. And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all     the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over     all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.      48. And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of     God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and     abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless,     I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,     were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon     the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the     great whore whom I saw.      49. And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of     abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all     the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against     the Lamb of God.      50. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the     Lamb of God, that it descended upon the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],["title","Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#5)"],["body","of the church of     the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who Were     scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with     righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.      51. And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was     poured out upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that     there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and     kindreds of the earth, and as there began to be wars and rumors     of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of     abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying, Behold, the wrath of     God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these     things:      17. And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out     upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable     church of all the earth, whose foundation is the devil, then, at     that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the     way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his     people, who are of the house of Israel.  I understand the injunction to Oliver Cowdery to \"contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil,\" to mean that he should contend against evil, against untruth, against all combinations of wicked men. They constitute the church of the devil, the kingdom of evil, a federation of unrighteousness; and the servants of God have a right to contend against that which is evil, let it appear where it will, in Catholic or in Protestant Christendom, among the philosophical societies of deists and atheists, and even within the Church of Christ, if, unhappily, it should make its appearance there. But, let it be understood, we are not brought necessarily into antagonism with the various sects of Christianity as such. So far as they have retained fragments of Christian truth--and each of them has some measure of truth--that far they are acceptable unto the Lord; and it would be poor policy for us to contend against them without discrimination. Wherever we find truth, whether it exists in complete form or only in fragments, we recognize that truth as part of that sacred whole of which the Church of Jesus Christ is the custodian; and I repeat that our relationship to the religious world is not one that calls for the denunciation of sectarian churches as composing the church of the devil. All that makes for untruth, for unrighteousness constitutes the kingdom of evil--the church of the devil. All that makes for truth, for righteousness, is of God; it constitutes the kingdom of righteousness--the empire of Jehovah; and, in a certain sense at least, constitutes the Church of Christ. With the latter--the kingdom of righteousness--we have no warfare. On the contrary both the spirit of the Lord's commandments to his servants and the dictates of right reason would suggest that we seek to enlarge this kingdom of righteousness both by recognizing such truths as it possesses and seeking the friendship and co-operation of the righteous men and women who constitute its membership.  Running parallel with these thoughts, I may be pardoned if I call your attention to a remark I made in one of these general conferences some time ago, to the effect that when misrepresentations are made of us, or of our faith, or when persecution arises against us, it must not embitter our minds, or make us feel hateful toward our fellowmen, or lead us to regard the whole world as our enemies. We must keep the sweetness of our own disposition. The language of the Savior wherein he says, \"Marvel not if the world hate you: it hated me before it hated you, if you were of the world, the world would love its own,\" etc., I contended then and believe now that the truth of that declaration will be more plainly seen if we read it in this way: \"Marvel not if the worldly hate you.\" If the ungodly, if those who make and love a lie--if such classes as these hate you, marvel not; for they were the classes that hated the Christ and the light and truth that he brought into the world, because their deeds were evil, and his light and truth were a reproof to their evil ways. And as we say concerning the \"Kingdom of Evil,\" so we say with reference to those who hate the truth and make war upon the righteous, they are not of any one cult, or confined to any one sect or division of the religious world, but, unhappily, are found here and there among all classes of people, among all Christian sects, among all religions and sects of philosophy. We ought to rightly divide, not only the word of truth, but the wicked and the ungodly from those who in common with us are seeking to know God and to keep his commandments. And there are millions who are hungering and thirsting for that knowledge; and we from time to time shall find them and lead them into God's temple of truth, where they shall be satisfied at the feast that the Lord is preparing for all those who hunger and thirst after righteousness.  The purpose of the Lord in instituting his Church in the earth is very beautifully set forth in one of the revelations in the D&C, as follows:      \"If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my     Church among them. Now I do not say this to destroy my Church, but     I say this to build up my Church. Therefore, whosoever belongeth     to my Church need not fear for such shall inherit the kingdom     of heaven. But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my     commandments, but build up churches unto themselves to get gain,     yea, all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of devil;     yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will     disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.\"  From this it very clearly appears that the purpose of God in the introduction of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times was not to destroy any truth that existed in the world, but to add to that truth, to increase it, and to draw together all truth and develop it into a beautiful system which men may rest contented, knowing God and their relationship to him, knowing of the future and their relation to that future.  We should present our message to the world in spirit of peace, charity and longsuffering; and avoid contention; for as our Book of Mormon tells us, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of God. I would the world could understand the unselfishness of our motives in presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ to them; if they could only know that our only desire was that they should come to a knowledge of the great principles of truth that are so comforting to us; that we desire their repentance and acceptance of the fullness of the truth, only that they might find favor with God, and share in our hopes of that eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began--if our fellowmen could be made to understand that this is our only purpose, it seems to me that many of the barriers that now separate us from our fellowmen would be broken down, and we would be able to reach the hearts of the people. I believe that as time passes and we become wiser in the methods of work we adopt, we will do that more and more, causing not only hundreds of thousands but millions of our Father's children to partake of those great blessings that the Gospel has brought to us. To make known these truths and cause the children of men to participate in the blessings that we ourselves enjoy, we yearly send hundreds of our Elders to the various nations of the earth. They sacrifice the pleasant associations of home, the society of wives and children, parents and friends; they sacrifice professional advantages and business opportunities; and sometimes sacrifice health and even life itself to proclaim to the world the truth which God has made known to us--enduring the world's reproach and contumely, because the world does not understand them nor their message; and there is still need, of the prayer on our part, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\" For the benefit of those who have passed away from the earth without a knowledge of the great truths and saving power of the gospel of Christ, we rear costly temples, whose spires pierce the skies of our beloved Utah; and within them at great sacrifice of time and means, the saints of God assemble to apply the principles and ordinances of the everlasting gospel to those who have passed away without the privilege of accepting them while upon the earth. A more completely unselfish work than this does not exist among men. On every hand the work of God bears the stamp of unselfishness upon it. Our Book of Mormon says: \"The laborers in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money, they shall perish.\" So through all the communications of God to his people shines the glorious principle of absolute unselfishness. Not only is it to be found in the words of our books, but a like testimony is written in the works of the Latter-day Saints--in their actions. Everywhere unselfishness abounds in the Church of Christ, both in theory and practice. Now, if we can only get the people of the world to understand this fact of unselfishness--this very genius of Mormonism--if they could be made to know that Mormonism is here to do good, to raise mankind from the low levels on which men are content to walk to the higher planes where God would have them walk, that they might have sweet fellowship with God, much of our difficulty in preaching the gospel would disappear. May the Lord hasten the day when the world shall know the Saints and the work of God better.    III.  SOME RECENT LITERATURE ON MORMONISM.  FOREWORD.  The following brief discussion of Mr. I.
