But I know.  They wrote as the men wrote, and probably with a still lighter touch.  Their homes were dark enough with anxiety, yet not by any word of theirs would the shadows be deepened.  They could not shield themselves from war’s horrors but they would do their best to shield their white swans at home.  They could not keep their women folk out of the war, but they would deliver them from its worst horrors.  Not till they had fallen would they let the shafts pass them to their mothers and wives; rather would they gather them in their own breasts. In the hour of the world’s supreme tragedy there was a woman standing by the cross, and the august Sufferer, with dying breath, bade His closest friend take her, when the last beam faded, to his own home and be in His place, a son to her.  I know no scene that better represents the feelings of our soldiers towards their loved ones at home.  Their women gave them inspiration and joy in the days of peace, and they still float before their vision amid the blackened ruins of war, as beautiful and stainless in their purity as the white swan on the moat of Ypres.                                       *II*                              *THE ROADMAKERS*   We had just marched from one part of the Front to another and by a round-about way.  Each morning the Quartermaster and \"the billeting party\" went on before, and each evening we slept in a village that was strange to us.  Each of the men carried on his back a pack and equipment weighing about eighty or ninety pounds. Through sleet and blizzard and, for the most part, through open, exposed country, we continued our march without a day of rest.  By the fifth evening we reached the village where we were to have three or four weeks of rest and training before entering the trenches for the spring offensive.  We had unpacked and were sitting at dinner when a telegram came announcing that all previous plans were canceled, and that at dawn we must take to the road again. Something unexpected had happened, good or ill, we knew not which, and we had to enter the line in front of Arras. For three days more we marched.  Daily the sound of the guns came nearer, and the men were tired and footsore.  They were also deeply disappointed of the long rest to which they had been looking forward after a winter in the trenches at Neuve Chapelle.  Yet they marched cheerily enough.  \"It’s the War!\" they said one to another and, true to their own philosophy, \"packed up their troubles in their old kit bags and smiled.\"  When any man faltered a bit, as if about to fall out by the way, the others cheered him on by singing \"Old Soldiers never die\" to the tune of the old Sunday school hymn, \"Kind words can never die.\"  Sometimes an officer would shoulder a man’s rifle to the end of the march, or until he felt better.  In eight unbroken days of marching we covered ninety-eight miles and finally arrived at a camp of huts within a day’s march of the trenches we are to occupy.  Here, where our huts stand like islands in a sea of mud, we are, unless suddenly needed, to take a few days’ rest.  On the ninety-eight miles of road over which we tramped, we passed company after company of British roadmakers.  In some parts they were widening the road, in other parts repairing it.  The roads of Northeastern France are handed over to our care as completely as if they were in England.  Our road-makers are everywhere, and as we pass they stand, pick or shovel in hand, to salute the colonel and shout some humorous remark to the laughing riflemen--only to get back as much as they give.  This morning I visited the neighboring village to arrange for a Sunday service.  The roads are hopeless for bicycles at this time of the year, so I fell back on Adam’s method of getting about.  The road to the village was torn and broken, and \"thaw precautions\" were being observed. Everywhere it was ankle-deep in mud and, in the holes, knee-deep. Innumerable motor-wagons had crushed it beneath their ponderous weight, and my feet had need of my eyes to guide them.  In skirting the holes and rough places, I added quite a mile to the journey.  It was annoying to get along so slowly, and I called the road \"rotten\" and blamed the War for its destructive work.  Then I saw that I had been unjust in judgment.  The War had constructed more than it had destroyed. The road had been a little muddy country lane, but the soldiers had made it wide as Fleet Street, and it was bearing a mightier traffic than that famous thoroughfare night and day.  The little road with its mean perfections and imperfections had gone, and the large road with big faults and big virtues had come.  This soldiers’ road has faults the farmers’ road knew not, but then it has burdens and duties unknown before, and it has had no time to prepare for them.  Like our boy-officers who are bearing grown men’s burdens of responsibility and bearing them well, the road has had no time to harden.  To strengthen itself for its duties, it eats up stones as a giant eats up food.  I had no right to look for the smoothness of Oxford Street or the Strand. Such avenues represent the work of centuries, this of days.  They have grown with their burdens, but this has had vast burdens thrown upon it suddenly, and while it was immature.  Oxford Street and Fleet Street are the roads of peace, and laden with wealth and luxury, law and literature--things that can wait.  But on this road of the soldiers’ making, nothing is allowed except it be concerned with matters of life and death.  It is the road of war, and there is a terrible urgency about it.  Over it pass ammunition to the guns, rations to the soldiers in the trenches, ambulances bearing back the wounded to the hospital.  Whatever its conditions the work must be done, and there is no room for a halting prudence or the pride of appearance.  Rough though it is and muddy, over it is passing, for all who have eyes to see, a new and better civilization and a wider liberty.  I had grumbled at the worn-out road when I ought to have praised it.  I was as an ingrate who finds fault with his father’s hands because they are rough and horny.  It was a group of soldier-roadmakers who brought me to my senses.  They were making a new road through the fields, and it branched off from the one I was on.  I saw its crude beginning and considered the burdens it would soon have to bear.  As I stood watching these English roadmakers my mind wandered down the avenues of time, and I saw the Roman soldiers building their immortal roads through England.  They were joining town to town and country to country.  They were introducing the people of the North to those of the South, and bringing the East into fellowship with the West.  I saw come along their roads the union of all England followed at, some distance, by that of England, Scotland and Wales; and I regretted that there was no foundation on which they could build a road to Ireland. I saw on those soldier-built roads, also, Christianity and Civilization marching, and in the villages and towns by the wayside they found a home whence they have sent out missionaries and teachers to the ends of the earth.  \"The captains and the kings depart.\"  The Roman Empire is no more, but the Roman roads remain.  They direct our modern life and business with an inevitability the Roman soldiers never exercised.  In two thousand years the Empire may have fallen apart and become a thing of the past; but the roads her sons have built in France, these two-and-a-half years, will abide forever and be a perpetual blessing; for, of things made by hands, there is, after the church and the home, nothing more sacred than the road.  The roadmaker does more for the brotherhood of man and the federation of the world than the most eloquent orator.  The roadmaker has his dreams and visions as well as the poet, and he expresses them in broken stones.  He uses stones as artists use colors, and orators words. He touches them--transient as they are--with immortality.  A little of his soul sticks to each stone he uses, and though the stone perishes the road remains.  His body may perish more quickly than the stones and be laid in some quiet churchyard by the wayside, but his soul will never utterly forsake the road he helped to make.  In man’s nature, and in all his works, there is a strange blending of the temporal and the eternal, and in nothing is it more marked than in the roads he builds.  The roadmaker is the pioneer among men and without him there would be neither artist nor orator.  He goes before civilization as John the Baptist went before Christ, and he is as rough and elemental.  Hard as his own stones, without him mankind would have remained savage and suspicious as beasts of prey; and art, science and literature would have had no beginning.  His road may begin in war, but it ends in peace.  The pioneers I saw roadmaking were, for the greater part, over military age, and such as I had often seen leaning heavily on the bar of some miserable beer-house.  In those days they seemed of the earth, earthy, and the stars that lure to high thoughts and noble endeavors seemed to shine on them in vain.  But one never knows what is passing in the heart of another.  Of all things human nature is the most mysterious and deceptive.  God seems to play at hide-and-seek with men.  He hides pearls in oysters lying in the ooze of the sea; and gold under the everlasting snows of the Arctic regions.  Diamonds he buries deep down in the dirt beneath the African veldt.  He places Christ in a carpenter’s shop, Joan of Arc in a peasant’s dwelling, Lincoln in a settler’s cabin, and Burns in a crude cottage built by his father’s own hands.  He hides generous impulses and heroic traits in types of men that in our mean imaginations we can only associate with the saw-dust sprinkled bar-room. Only when war or pestilence have kindled their fierce and lurid "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46323"],["title","The Soul of the Soldier: Sketches from the Western Battle-Front (#3)"],["body","do we find the hidden nobility that God has stored away in strange places--places often as foul and unlikely as those where a miser stores his gold.  When Diogenes went about with a candle in search of an honest man did he think to look in the taverns and slums?  I fancy not. Not Diogenes’ candle but the \"Light of the World\" was needed to reveal the treasure God has hidden in men.  Christ alone knew where His Father had hidden His wealth and could guide us to it.  In this time of peril when every man with any nobility in him is needed to stand in the deadly breach, and with body and soul hold back the brutality and tyranny that would enslave the world we have, like the woman in the parable, lit a candle and searched every corner of our kingdom diligently.  In the dust of unswept corners we have found many a coin of value that, but for our exceeding need, would have remained hidden. To me, the wealth and wonder of the war have been found in its sweepings.  Time and again we have found those who were lost, and a new happiness has come into life.  To the end of my days I shall walk the earth with reverent feet.  I did not know men were so great.  I have looked at life without seeing the gold through the dust, and have been no better than a Kaffir child playing marbles with diamonds, unaware of their value.  I have gone among my fellows with proud step where I ought to have walked humbly, and have rushed in where angels feared to tread.  Life at the Front has made me feel mean among mankind.  My comrades have been so great.  In days long past, I have trodden on the hem of Christ’s garment without knowing it.  I have not seen its jewels because I, and others, have so often trodden it in the mire. Yet, through the mire of slum and tavern, the jewels have emerged pearl-white and ruby-red. And I feel that I owe to a large part of mankind an apology for having been before the war so blind, callous and superficial.  But for the agony and bloody sweat in which I have seen my fellows, I should never have known them for what they are, and the darkness of death would have covered me before I had realized what made the death of Christ and the sufferings of all the martyrs well worth while.  Now there is a new light upon my path and I shall see the features of an angel through the dirt on a slum-child’s face.  Words of Christ that once lay in the shadow now stand out clearly, for whenever we get below the surface of life we come to _Him_.  He is there before us, and awaiting our coming.  I also understand, now, something of the meaning of the words which the Unemployed scrawled upon their banner before the war--\"Damn your charity.  Give us work.\"  It was a deep and true saying, and taught them by a stern teacher.  When the war came we _did_ \"damn our charity\" and gave them \"work.\"  Many a man got his first chance of doing \"a man’s job,\" and rose to the full height of his manhood.  Many hitherto idle and drunken, were touched in their finer parts.  They saw their country’s need, and though their country had done little to merit their gratitude, they responded to her call before some of the more prudent and sober.  Those who were young went out to fight, and every officer can tell stories about their behavior in the hours of danger and suffering which bring tears to the eyes and penitence to the heart. Those above military age went out to make roads over which their younger brothers and sons could march, and get food, ammunition, or an ambulance according to their needs.  Among the group of middle-aged roadmakers that I saw there were, I doubt not, some who had been counted wastrels and who had made but a poor show of life.  Now they had got work that made them feel that they were men and not mendicants, and they were \"making good.\"  While I watched them a lark rose from a neighboring field and sang over them a song of the coming spring.  It was the first lark I had heard this year, and I was glad it mingled its notes with the sounds of the roadmakers’ shovels.  Nature is not so indifferent to human struggles as it sometimes seems.  The man who stands steadfastly by the right and true and bids tyranny and wrong give place will find, at last, that he is in league with the stones of the field and the birds of the air, and that the stars in their courses fight for him.  The roadmaker and the lark are born friends. Both are heralds of coming gladness, and while one works, the other sings.  True work and pure song are never far apart.  They are both born of hope and seek to body forth the immortal. A man works while he has faith. Would he sow if he did not believe the promise, made under the rainbow, that seed-time and harvest shall never fail?  Or could he sing with despair choking his heart?  Yet he can sing with death choking it.  In the very act of dying Wesley sang the hymn, \"I’ll praise my Maker while I’ve breath.\"  He sang because of the hope of immortality.  He was not turning his face to the blank wall of death and oblivion but to the opening gate of a fuller life.  He was soaring sunwards like the lark, and soaring sang,      \"And when my voice is lost in death     Praise shall employ my nobler powers;     My days of praise shall ne’er be past.\"   Joy can sing and Sorrow can sing, but Despair is dumb.  It has not even a cry, for a cry is a call for help as every mother knows, and Despair knows no helper.  Even the saddest song has hope in it, as the dreariest desert has a well.  The loved one is dead but Love lives on and whispers of a trysting place beyond this bourne of time, where loved and lover meet again.  The patriot’s life may be pouring from a dozen wounds on the muddy field of battle, but his fast-emptying heart is singing with each heavy beat, \"Who dies, if my country live?\"  Roadmakers have prepared the way for missionaries in every land. Trail-blazers are not always religious men--often they are wild, reckless fellows whom few would allow a place in the Kingdom of God--but is not their work religious in its final upshot?  Do they not, however unconsciously, \"prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God?\"  Close on their heels go the missionaries, urged on faster by the pure love of souls than the trader by love of lucre. The greatest among the roadmakers was a missionary himself--David Livingstone.  And for such an one the name Living-stone is perfect.  It has the touch of destiny.  Through swamp and forest he went where white feet had never trod, and blazed a trail for the messengers of Christ, until, worn out with fever and hardship, he fell asleep at his prayers, to wake no more to toil and suffering.  But while the roadmaker bestows benefits on us he also lays obligations, for there can be no enlargement of privilege without a corresponding increase of responsibility.  The roads the men are making here in France will be good for trade.  They will open up the country as did the military roads of Caesar and Napoleon; and along them soldiers are marching who, at tremendous cost to themselves, are buying for posterity great benefits, and laying upon posterity great obligations.  Posterity must hold and enlarge the liberties won for them, and prove worthy of their citizenship by resisting tyranny \"even unto blood.\"  We are here because our fathers were heroes and lovers of liberty.  Had they been cowards and slaves there would have been no war for us.  As we follow our fathers our sons must be ready to follow us.  The present springs out of the past, and the future will spring out of the present. Inheritance implies defense on the part of the inheritors.  The very names they give to their roads show that our soldiers have grasped this fact. The cold canvas hut in which I am writing is officially described as No. 1 Hut, _Oxford Street_.  A little farther off, and running parallel with it, is _Cambridge_ Road.  There is also an _Eton_ Road, _Harrow_ Road, and _Marlborough_ Road.  Students of the universities and schools after which these roads are named are out here to defend what these institutions have stood for through the hoary centuries.  They are out to preserve the true conception of Liberty and Fair-play, and to build roads along which all peoples who desire it can travel unmolested by attacks from either tyrants or anarchists.  Right from the beginning of the war, the idea of a Road has taken hold of the imagination of our soldiers.  The first divisions came out singing, \"It’s a long, long way to Tipperary, but my heart’s right there.\"  Nowadays the popular song is \"There’s a long, long trail awinding into the Land of my dreams.\"  They are making a Road of Liberty along which all nations may pass to universal peace and brotherhood, and where the weak will be as safe from oppression as the strong.  \"It’s a long, long way to go,\" but they have seen their goal on the horizon, and will either reach it or die on the way to it.  They have made up their minds that never again shall the shadow of the Kaiser’s mailed fist, or that any other tyrant fall across their path.  These men never sing of war.  They hate war.  It is a brutal necessity forced on them by the ambition of a tyrant.  Their songs are all of peace and none of war.  Of the future and not the present they sing:      \"Tiddley-iddley-ighty,     Hurry me home to Blighty;     Blighty is the place for me.\"   Whether they sing with levity or seriousness (and levity of manner often veils their seriousness of feeling), it is of a future of peace and goodwill they sing.  To them the war is a hard road leading to a better life for mankind.  It is to them what the desert was to the Israelites, when they left the bondage of Egypt for the liberty of the Land of Promise. Therefore they must tread it without faltering even as Christ trod the way of the Cross. \"There’s a long, long trail awinding into the Land of their dreams\" and they will not lose faith in their dreams however wearisome the way.
