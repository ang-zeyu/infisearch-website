The top plane fell one way, the lower another, while my friend and the motor dropped like stones.  I would have given anything to put off my own test for a few days, but within twenty-four hours I received orders that my turn had come; and orders were orders. I made up my mind to be very careful and to take my time about the climb.  That first flight at six thousand feet gave me a thrilling sensation.  I remembered my first flight alone, when I had barely reached two hundred feet.  It seemed now as if I was going to mount to an indescribable height.  Since that day I have had to go up that high often, and even higher; but it has all become commonplace, for familiarity breeds contempt in the air as well as on land.  I was so very cautious about mounting that twenty minutes elapsed before the needle on my registering barometer marked six thousand feet.  It was very cold.  The wind struck my face with icy blasts, but I was so excited that I did not really mind it.  After a while I shut off the motor and started to volplane to earth.  I came down a little too rapidly and made a very bad landing.  In fact, for a moment I thought that I had broken my machine. I was wet all through from the sudden rise in temperature and stone-deaf.  It was ten minutes before I could hear again. Then I received my call-down.  It seems that when a pilot has been up to a very great height, he loses his sense of altitude—his \"sens de profondeur,\" as the French call it.  When approaching the ground he cannot tell whether he is twenty-five or fifty feet in the air.  He must take every care, before making contact, to train his eye for \"depths\" again by flying a few minutes fairly close to the ground.  It is only a question of a few moments, but it is a necessary precaution.  My next climb to six thousand feet was better.  In fact, I felt a certain degree of confidence.  It took me somewhat longer to mount to the required height, because some clouds came up and I had to search for a hole through which to pass. Everywhere below me, as far as my eyes could reach, was a sea of clouds.  The sun was shining on their snowy-white crests.  It looked for all the world as though I was looking down upon an enormous bowl of froth.  The following morning was the day fixed for my ten-thousand-foot ascension.  The atmosphere was remarkably clear, and I felt an extraordinary sense of freedom and power as I rose from the ground.  The earth below me was bright with color.  As I climbed higher the shades became less brilliant.  At ten thousand feet all color had vanished. The only hue visible was a varying degree of shading, gray and black. Below me I could make out the city of Chartres.  Forty miles away lay Orléans. To one side, the Loire wound its course in a gray, ribbon-like band.  On all sides the straight, white roads were merely blurred streaks in the murky mass.  A few days later I started on my endurance test, the triangle, in company with five other machines.  In this flight of two hundred and fifty kilometres I had to make landings at two towns where there were aviation-fields, and the third my own field.  At each place I had to report to the aviation officer in charge and have my papers signed.  In case of a breakdown on this flight I had forty-eight hours in which to make the necessary repairs and complete the test.  [Illustration: A Farman artillery-machine.]  The day of my triangle was a poor one for flying.  It was the first warm morning of early spring and the sun was just soaking the moisture out of the ground.  The air was, in consequence, spotty and there were many \"remous,\" or whirlpools.  These whirlpools often cause a sudden \"perte de vitesse\" and are therefore very dangerous. The machine is sailing along quietly and smoothly, when suddenly the controls become lifeless. You glance at your speed-indicator and at your engine-speed.  Both show that the machine is travelling well above the minimum safety speed. This is apt to puzzle the beginner, for without warning there follows a sudden jolt.  Your machine trembles like a frightened horse and unexpectedly leaps forward again.  On a day like this you have to fight the machine all the time to maintain its equilibrium.  The first leg of the triangle was accomplished without incident.  As I was starting my motor for the second stage, however, I noticed that the ignition was faulty. A spark-plug had become fouled with oil, and I had to change it before venturing up again.  My companions started without me, calling out that I could catch up with them at Versailles, where they intended to lunch.  I hurriedly screwed on a new spark-plug and threw my tool-bag back into the box under the extra seat, but in my hurry to be off I neglected to fasten it down.  I was later to regret my carelessness.  I soon found that in trying to catch up with the others I had no easy task before me.  The day was well advanced, and the \"remous\" which I encountered were countless. I climbed and climbed.  To no avail. The cloud ceiling was at eighteen hundred metres, and I could not escape the \"remous\" so low.  The country below me was all wooded and interspersed with lakes both large and small.  There was not a landing-place in view. Suddenly I felt a hard blow on the back of my head and a weight pushing against me.  \"Ça y est,\" I thought; \"the machine can’t stand the buffeting and has given way.\"  I ventured a look back.  To my surprise, everything seemed intact—everything except the observer’s seat, which was leaning against my head! It was the seat which I had forgotten to hook down at Châteaudun!  I was greatly relieved, and fastened it back into place.  Just then I came within sight of Versailles.  I looked for the aviation-field at which I was supposed to land.  Instead of one I saw three, lying about two miles apart.  This was indeed a puzzle. From the height at which I was flying I could not make out which was the school. I picked out one which I thought should probably be the haven of refuge for my storm-tossed aeroplane and spiralled down. I climbed out of my machine.  No one seemed to be about.  No mechanics ran out to assist me, as is usually the case at the schools.  \"It must be the luncheon-hour,\" I thought, \"and all the mecaniciens are at déjeuner.\"  I glanced over to where the machines were ranged in line.  To my surprise, they were not of the model I had seen at Pau and Chartres, but the latest and fastest \"avions de chasse.\"  Somewhat uncertain as to my whereabouts, I walked over to the office.  I was not left long in ignorance of my error.  I had landed on a secret testing-field, access to which was obtained only by special permit.  The sergeant advised me to lose no time in leaving, for if the captain saw me I would be speedily punished in accordance with the military regulations.  I needed no second urging, and within five minutes I was on the right field, explaining to my comrades why I had been so long rejoining them.  It seems that they had experienced a very pleasant flight all the way, for the hour’s start they had had over me had enabled them to escape most of the \"remous,\" which are always at their worst in the middle of the day.  Late in the afternoon we returned to Chartres.  This was the most enjoyable part of the day’s flying.  The aerial conditions were perfect and we were able to allow ourselves the pleasure of appreciating all the interesting places we passed over. First we saw the beautiful valley of the Chevreuse; then Rambouillet, with its wonderful hunting and fishing preserves. Next I caught a glimpse of the imposing palace and gardens of Maintenon.  The time passed all too quickly; yet when we reached home it was almost dark.  We all felt quite tired, but before putting our machines away, however, we asked permission to make our spirals, so that we might complete every requirement of the brevet before night set in. We were anxious to do this, so that we might obtain our \"permissions\" immediately.  We did not wish to lose a moment.  A four days’ leave is always accorded each pilot the moment he has satisfactorily fulfilled all the requirements of the course.  Our request was granted and the final test was successfully passed.  I was now a full-fledged aviator, with the rank of corporal, with the regular pay of eight cents a day and an additional indemnity of forty-five cents as a member of the Flying Corps.                          *THE ZEPPELIN RAID OVER PARIS*   I decided to spend my four days’ \"permission\" in Paris, the rendezvous of all aviators when not on active service. From the first I felt conscious of unusual attention.  People seemed to treat me with deference and with more respect than I had ever before experienced.  I could not account for it.  Then, of a sudden, I chuckled to myself.  The envied stars and wings on my collar were the cause.  I was a \"pilote aviateur,\" a full-fledged member of the aerial light cavalry of France.  For most \"permissionnaires\" Paris usually offers only the distractions of its theatres and restaurants, its boulevards, and its beautiful monuments.  These pleasures I also had looked forward to, but in the first thirty-six hours of my visit occurred another, more startling diversion—two Zeppelin raids.  It was my first real experience of the war.  The first alarm occurred as we were leaving a restaurant after dinner. A motor fire-engine rushed by, sounding the alert for the approaching enemy.  Pandemonium reigned in the streets.  I hastened to find a way to reach the aviation-field at Le Bourget, where I felt that duty called me.  The concierge hailed a taxi.  I jumped in and gave the address to the chauffeur.  \"Le Bourget!  Oh, mais non,\" exclaimed the man; \"monsieur must think me a fool.\"  He flatly refused me as a fare.  He was the father of a family, and he certainly would not go to the very spot where all the bombs were certain to be dropped; besides—he did not have enough gasolene in his tank for so long a run.  We"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46299"],["title","With the French Flying Corps (#6)"],["body"," and argued.  In desperation I thrust my hand in my pocket and handed him a generous retainer.  At the sight of the money he wavered.  I followed up my advantage and promised him a handsome tip if he started at once. He threw in his clutch.  I had won my first \"engagement.\"  The streets were pitch-dark and jammed with people, all staring heavenward.  The feeble oil-lights of the taxicab barely lit up their faces as we wound our way in and out.  At breakneck speed we swung right and left, sounding the horn and crying out warning \"attentions.\"  Near the outskirts of the city we could see search-lights flashing against the heavy mist.  There was so much fog, however, that they could not pierce the veil which hung over the city.  At one thousand five hundred feet the sky was opaque.  The anti-aircraft batteries were barking and sending off deep-red flashes into the impenetrable murkiness in answer to wireless signals from the invisible air guards above.  Now and then a military automobile dashed by.  [Illustration: Newspaper dropped by German raiders within the French lines.]  As we neared Le Bourget, there was a deep detonation.  A bomb had been dropped.  The Zeppelin had arrived.  My chauffeur in panic jammed on the brakes. I was literally thrown out of the taxi and into the arms of a waiting sentinel who flashed an electric torch into my face. The sergeant of the guard rushed up and escorted me to the guard-house, where an officer proceeded to question me.  I immediately realized that I was an object of suspicion.  Who was I and what was I doing here? Here I was, a foreigner in the French uniform, and unknown to them. Instead of being welcomed at the post of danger I found to my amusement that I was temporarily under arrest.  Several more explosions were heard. Then a deathlike silence.  The cannon ceased their angry roar, the search-lights put out their blinding rays.  Through the window I noticed a large fire in the middle of the \"piste,\" where several cans of gasolene had been ignited.  It was the signal for the searching aeroplanes to return. The Zeppelin had left.  As soon as the electric current had been switched on again the captain returned. He seemed surprised at my \"enthusiasm.\"  \"Just like you Americans,\" he said smiling.  \"A man en permission, however, should never look for trouble.\"  He then explained that this night guarding required special training.  Even had he needed my services, I would have been helpless, as I had never before flown after sundown.  One by one the defenders of Paris returned.  At two thousand feet they were invisible, though we could hear the humming of their motors.  Then, as they came nearer and nearer we saw little indefinite lights moving in the mist above us, and finally the machines, their dimmed search-lights yet staring like two great eyes.  About fifty aeroplanes are in the air around Paris all the time.  Each pilot remains up three hours, when he is relieved by another flier. When the Zeppelins are known to have crossed the front, some eighty miles away, the whole defense squadron of two hundred takes to the air. The organization of the aerial defense of Paris is admirable, and it is this, together with the efficient anti-aircraft posts in the environs, which prevents the \"Boches\" from raiding Paris more often.  I was allowed to examine everything at my leisure, and took advantage of this opportunity to gain as much information as I could about the lighting systems and the new models of small cannon which had recently been installed on the aeroplanes.  Presently I was greeted by one of the pilots who had just landed.  He proved to be an old acquaintance.  It seems that the Zeppelin had profited by the mist to slip by our watchers at the front, and had reached the very outskirts of the city before it was sighted by the air guards of Paris.  The Boches dropped several bombs near the Gare du Nord and in the vicinity of Le Bourget. Then they had vanished into the mist.  \"How could they ever find the railway-station in the dark?\" I asked.  \"That’s easy,\" he answered. \"The Zeppelins are equipped with a small observation-car that hangs down on a long cable.  It is built something like an aeroplane and travels about five thousand feet below the dirigible. This evening the raider flew at an altitude of seven thousand feet, while the car moved along only two thousand feet from the ground.  Its passenger could, therefore, locate everything easily and telephone the directions to the commander above.\"  \"But,\" I insisted, \"how did they ever locate the freight-yards in the dark?\"  \"Easily,\" replied my companion; \"their spies had arranged all that.  They simply hung a series of blue lights in the chimneys of houses and laid out a path directly to the spot.\"  These spies in all probability had been already caught, but I was angry, very angry, to realize that their \"espionage\" was still so efficient.  On the way home Paris seemed surprisingly normal again.  The street-lamps were glowing peaceably and the cafés were crowded with talkative men and women.  I could not help thinking how wonderful those people were, how fearless and forgetful of danger.  The actual damage done by the bombs during that raid was insignificant. The photographs published in the daily press bore witness to this.  A few civilians were killed, but no military damage was done. It was only an attempt at terrorism.  I visited one of the \"craters\" the next morning.  The bomb had landed directly over the subway and had blown a huge hole in the pavement.  The tracks below lay open to view.  Gangs of laborers were already at work, not repairing the damage but enlarging the hole.  I asked them what this was for.  \"Why, monsieur, it is this way.  The health authorities always insisted that a ventilator was needed in this part of the ’Metropolitain.’  The Boches obligingly saved us the trouble and expense.  We are now merely going to put a fence around it.\"  [Illustration: An anti-aircraft .75.]  That night there was another alarm. We were spending the evening with friends in the Latin Quarter when the pompiers startled us with their wailing sirens.  From every direction came the \"Alerte! the Zeppelins are coming.  Lights out!\"  One by one the street-lamps faded, apartments were darkened, and the street-cars stopped where they were, plunged into darkness. It was thrilling.  In the velvety gloom the outlines of people and motors could be seen moving about.  The corner of the rue d’Assas alone remained illuminated. A \"bec de gaz\" was still burning brightly, to the rage of an old infantry colonel who was too short to reach it himself.  To our amusement, a little girl clad in a red kimono and bedroom slippers ran out into the street and volunteered her aid.  The old soldier blurted out a word or two, then lifted her up in his arms while she extinguished the light.  \"Thanks, mademoiselle. Now, quick!\" he gasped; \"run back to bed.\"  We saw some of the people climb down into their cellars.  The majority, however, gathered in the streets, looking up at the search-light swept sky.  Tiny, starlike lights moved about above us and we knew that aeroplanes of the \"Garde de Paris\" were searching for the venturesome raider.  \"I don’t believe the sales Boches and their sausage balloon are coming this evening to beg food,\" remarked one man.  \"Oh, no,\" answered another, \"it is clear and they well know that a Zeppelin over Paris to-night is a Zeppelin less for Germany.\"  Just then we heard the firemen coming back.  Their bugles were playing a jubilant call.  The Zeppelins had been frightened away.  Everywhere lights were again lit. The people laughed good-naturedly at their neighbors’ strange attire. \"Quelle guerre!\" yawned the old officer at my elbow; \"down in the ground, under the sea, and over our homes!  Quelle guerre!\"                        *AT THE ECOLE DE PERFECTIONNEMENT*   From Chartres I was sent to Châteauroux to continue my studies and perfect myself in flying.  Châteauroux is a small provincial town situated half-way between the château country and the beautiful valley of the river Creuse.  It was originally founded by the Romans, and before the war had a large \"caserne.\"  All this is forgotten to-day in the glory of the stream of air pilots that pass through the \"Ecole deviation militaire.\"  Soldiers are to be found everywhere, but not aviators, and the residents of Châteauroux are very conscious of the honor conferred upon their town.  When a pilot has received his \"brevet\" he has really only begun his professional education.  This I soon found out at Châteauroux.  The day after my arrival I was set to work making daily flights and attending the various courses and lectures on artillery-fire, bomb-dropping, war aviation, \"liaison,\" and the design of enemy aircraft. The daily flights were very short, lasting only fifteen minutes each.  We made three or four of them each day, and their purpose was chiefly to give us greater confidence in making our landings.  We were allowed to take up passengers, and we often paired off and took each other up.  In this connection it was amusing to see how every one avoided being taken up by certain pilots. Some men cannot fly: their temperaments prevent it, and try as they will they cannot improve.  This is generally due to sheer stupidity or to lack of nerve.  One thing is certain, and that is that these men will kill themselves sooner or later if they persist in their efforts to fly.  An incident occurred shortly after my arrival at the school.  About thirty pilots were receiving practical instruction on the aviation-field and were standing around two aeroplanes.  About a hundred feet away another machine was making ready to start.  When the mechanic spun the propeller at the word from the aviator the motor started, not slowly as it should, but with a roar.  The machine began to roll toward the group of men.  Instead of cutting off the ignition—we found out later that the wire connecting"]]]
