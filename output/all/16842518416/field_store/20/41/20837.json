As far as my imagination would enable me, I brought before my mind all the {27} honor, glory, and happiness of the whole world. I thought of the gold and the wealth of the rich, of the glory, grandeur, and power of kings, presidents, princes, and rulers. I thought of the military renown of Alexander, Napoleon, and other great generals. I cast my mind over the innumerable paths through which the giddy world travels in search of pleasure and happiness. In summing up the whole matter in the vision of my mind, I had to exclaim with Solomon: 'All is vanity of vanities sayeth the preacher.'  \"I could see that within a few years all would end alike in the grave. I was convinced that no man could enjoy true happiness and obtain that which would feed the immortal soul, except God was his friend and Jesus Christ his advocate. I was convinced that man became their friend by doing the will of the Father, and by keeping His commandments. I made a firm resolution that from then I would seek the Lord to know His will, to keep His commandments, and to follow the dictates of His Holy Spirit. Upon this ground I was determined to stand and to spend my future life in the maintenance of these convictions.\" It will be here easily seen that determination which led him through all the subsequent years of his life to do whatever he did for the glory of God.  In May, 1830, he was employed to run a flour mill for Mr. Samuel Collins of Collinsville, Connecticut. At first he went to board with about thirty young men. These being of a worldly turn of mind, he did not enjoy their influence and therefore took up his residence in the family of Mr. Dudley D. Sackett.  About this time, under the influence of a religious revival, his brother Asahel made profession of religion and seemed very devoted. Wilford became specially anxious to know the will of the Lord. \"I prayed night and day, and the Lord blest me with much of His spirit. These began to be the happiest days of my life. I felt that the sun, moon, and stars; the mountains, hills, and valleys; and that all creation were united in the praise of the Lord.\"  \"My work in the mill was very light and I passed much of my time in reading, in meditation, and in prayer. I read the Bible and it was like a new book to me. I received much light in perusing its sacred pages. If I was cast down, tried, or {28} tempted, I found in it relief in connection with the Spirit of God. The religious reformation continued in Farmington and a number of my relatives were actively engaged in the service of the Lord according to the best light they had. Among them were my Uncle Ozem Woodruff and his wife Hannah. They were good people and I was much attached to them, having lived with them a good deal in my early life. I enjoyed their society very much.  \"A short distance from the mill was a beautiful island upon the top of which was a level field covered with flowers. The island was surrounded by a rapid current of water dashing over the rocks. The banks of the current were thickly studded by tall, waving pines. I chose this pleasant retreat on the top of the island as my place of prayer and supplication. I retired to it many times, both by day and by night and offered up my soul in prayer to the Lord. I never shall forget the happy hours I spent alone in mediation and prayer upon that solitary island. When sitting there alone, there would come to my mind the words of Robert Pollock:    'In the wide desert where the view was large,   Pleasant were many scenes, but most to me   The solitude of vast extent untouched by hand   Whose nature sowed herself and reaped her crop;   Whose garments were the clouds; whose minstrels, brooks;   Whose lamps, the moon and stars; whose organ choir,   The voice of many waters; whose banquets,   The falling leaves; whose heroes, storms; whose warriors,   Mighty winds; whose lovers, flowers;   Whose orators, the thunderbolt of God;   Whose palaces, the everlasting hills;   Whose ceilings, Heaven's unfathomable blue;   And from whose rocky turrets battled high   Prospects immense spread out on all sides in air,   Lost now between the welkin and the main,   Now walked with hills that slept above the storm.'  \"The Lord blest me with joy and happiness such as I had never before enjoyed, doubtless because I was living up to the best light I had. I had no apostle or prophet to teach me the right way; so I had to do the best I could. In my zeal to promote {29} good, I got up prayer meetings in our village and prayed for light and knowledge. It was my desire to receive the ordinances of the gospel, as I could plainly see by reading the Bible that baptism by immersion was a sacred ordinance. In my eagerness, yet being ignorant of the holy priesthood and of the true authority to officiate in the ordinances of eternal life, I requested the Baptist minister to baptize me. At first he refused because I told him I would not join his church as it did not harmonize with the apostolic church which our Savior established. Finally after several conversations, he baptized me on the 5th of May, 1831. He also baptized my brother Asahel. This was the first and only gospel ordinance I sought for until I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"  Wilford continued with Mr. Collins for less than a year, but left him with the best feelings. The latter told Wilford that he would always be welcome at his home, and that as an honorable young man, worthy of trust, he would cheerfully give him any recommendations he desired.  Wilford held himself aloof from membership in any of the churches. He visited their meetings and conversed with their ministers. He wanted to know why there were no more apostles and prophets. He was told that they were done away with, because they were no longer needed. Such a statement only intensified his disbelief in sectarian churches.  On one occasion, after praying most earnestly to know about the people of the Lord, if any such there were on earth, he says: \"The Spirit of the Lord said unto me: 'Go to my Word and I will there show thee my will and answer thy prayer.' I opened the Bible promiscuously, praying the Lord to direct me to that portion of his Word which would answer my prayer. I opened to the 56th Chapter of Isaiah. I was satisfied it was in response to my prayer. I felt that the salvation of God was about to be revealed and His righteousness come forth. I was also satisfied that I should live to see the people of God gathered. From this time on until the gospel found me I was contented and felt that I should trouble myself no more about the churches and the ministers. In our zeal my brother Azmon and I adopted the worship of the Lord on Saturday instead of Sunday. I felt that a change from the seventh to the first day of the week was likely {30} a perversion made by man without authority from heaven.\"  It was while staying with Mr. Cowles in the spring of 1832 that he saw for the first time an account of the \"Mormons.\" These were described in a newspaper article as a new sect claiming to have new revelations and to be built upon the foundation of prophets and apostles the same as the ancient Saints. The editor of the newspaper ridiculed the Mormons, but Wilford was favorably impressed. From that time on he desired to see these new people; for if they enjoyed the gifts which were bestowed upon the ancient Saints, they were the very people for whom he was seeking.  Soon after this he made a settlement with Mr. Cowles and arranged his affairs with a view of moving to western New York. Of the circumstances leading up to this change in his life, he writes: \"The spirit that was upon me day and night said, 'Go to Rhode Island.' My mind was greatly exercised over the matter for I could not comprehend what it meant. I went to live with my brother Azmon until our departure for New York. After saluting him, I said: 'I wonder what the Lord wants of me in Rhode Island! The spirit of the Lord has rested upon me for two weeks and said, \"Go to Rhode Island.\"' In about an hour after this my brother Asahel arrived on a visit. After shaking hands with him, almost the first words he spoke were: 'I wonder what the Lord wants of me in Rhode Island! The spirit of the Lord has been upon me for two or three weeks and has told me to go to Rhode Island.' This caused us to marvel exceedingly. We had not seen each other for several months. My brother Azmon thought that as we were ready to go to New York, we better not go to Rhode Island. To this we consented with great reluctance. I felt sure it was our duty to go there, although at that time it was a mystery.\"  Later on when the gospel came to them in New York, Wilford learned that if they had gone to Rhode Island they would have met Elders Orson Hyde and Samuel H. Smith and would have thus received the gospel at an earlier date than they did by at least one year. Had they gone to Rhode Island and received the gospel there, they would have undoubtedly gone direct to Kirtland, Ohio. As it was, they stopped in New York where they purchased a farm.  {31} This incident furnished an illustration of the safety of obeying the spirit of the Lord, even when the reason at the time is not apparent. The example of Adam is a further illustration of that same beautiful truth. \"Adam, why dost thou offer sacrifice?\" asked the angel. \"I know not,\" was the reply, \"save that God has commanded me.\" Such illustrations show the folly of basing one's conduct wholly upon experience, or upon the powers of human understanding. There are other lamps to guide our feet than that of experience or the wisdom of man. The incident is a striking illustration also of the untruth of that sometime infidel dogma which says: \"We"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],["title","Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#0)"],["body","AND  FAMILY RECORD  OF  LORENZO SNOW,  One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Written and Compiled by his Sister,  Eliza R. Snow Smith.  \"I know him, that he will command his children after him, and they shall keep the word of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\"  \"If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God--possessing the principles which God possesses.\"--Joseph Smith.  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Deseret News Company, Printers.  1884.    Preface.  This Biography and Autobiography of my brother, Lorenzo Snow, has been written as a tribute of sisterly affection for him; and as a token of sincere respect to his family.  It is designed to be handed down in lineal descent, from generation to generation--to be preserved as a family Memorial.  In adapting it to this purpose, both in the matter originated, and in that compiled, the writer has varied materially from the usual course of biographers. That it may constitute a historical point to which my brother's posterity, to the latest generations, who shall honor the Gospel of the Son of God, may trace their origin in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and find a record of their illustrious ancestor--his wives, children and grandchildren--a full genealogical record is inserted. That his descendants may profit by his instructions, selections from his letters and discourses are copied into this work; we also have inscribed missionary sketches of some of his sons and sons-in-law.
