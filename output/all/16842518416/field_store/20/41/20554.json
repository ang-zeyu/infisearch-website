As the trains came to a stop the men would make a rush for the station buffet, and the French would exchange all sorts of pleasantries with them.  Right here I had a lot of fun with the Tommies, for they could not understand how a Frenchman could speak English so fluently.  Then came my train, and I found myself en route for Pau.  As there were already several American \"élèves pilotes\" at the aviation school, I had no difficulty in learning the ropes.  It was all very simple.  But it was well to know what to expect, especially when it came to the question of discipline, which was very strict until one became a full-fledged aviator.  It was just like going back to school and I settled down for the long grind.                                *FIRST PRINCIPLES*   I have rarely been as much impressed as when I first saw the flying school at Pau.  It is situated eight miles beyond the town on the hard meadow-lands granted in the sixteenth century to the villages of Osseau by Henri IV.  The grant is still in effect, and the fields now in use are only rented by the government. They make a perfect aviation-ground. Four separate camps and a repair-station lie about a mile from one another and are named—Centre, Blériot, etc.  At Centre I saw the low, gray hangars that house the aeroplanes, the tall wireless mast over which the communiqués from Paris are daily received, the office-building for the captain and monitors of the school, and the little café across the road where every one goes when off duty. Beyond were the Boche prisoners working on the road, building fences, or cutting wood, under direction of their non-commissioned officers and decrepit old territorials—grim reminders that this flying business is not all play. It was early morning—the mists were slowly lifting—when the \"élèves pilotes\" gathered for their daily work.  Mechanics ran the machines out on the field in long lines, and the motors woke to motion with startling roars.  One by one the pilots stepped in, and one by one the little biplanes moved swiftly across the field, rose, dipped slightly, rose again, and then mounted higher and higher into the gray sky.  In the distance the snowy peaks of the Pyrenees formed an impressive background. At almost any time during training hours one can see from ten to twenty machines in the air.  There are over three hundred men training.  The repair-shops are like a large manufacturing plant.  Five hundred mechanics are continually employed there.  Among these are little Indo-Chinese, or \"Anamites,\" as the French call them, who have come from distant Asia to help France in her struggle for liberty. As French citizens they are mobilized and wear the military uniform, but their tasks are usually of the monotonous, routine variety.  [Illustration: \"Mechanics ran the machines out on the field in long lines.\"]  The repair-shops are continually working under pressure, as accidents occur daily.  It is estimated that the average cost to France of training each pilot is five thousand dollars.  Most of the accidents, however, are caused by carelessness, stupidity, or overconfidence.  The day I joined the school two of the members lost their lives in a curious accident.  They were flying at a great height, but thoughtlessly allowed their machines to approach too closely.  Before they could change direction there was a crash, and both came tumbling to earth.  When two aeroplanes come too near to each other the suction of their propellers pulls them together and they become uncontrollable. That is what happened to these two unfortunate \"élèves.\"  The officer in charge of the school explained at length just how this accident happened.  We were cautioned against overlooking the fact that the speed of an aeroplane is always spoken of in reference to the body of the air in which the machine is moving. Thus an aeroplane travelling eighty miles an hour with a twenty-mile breeze is travelling at a speed of a hundred miles an hour in reference to the ground.  The two machines at the time of the accident were flying east and west, but, while both were travelling at the same speed with reference to the ground, the plane moving in the direction of the wind was making about ninety miles an hour, while the other was covering barely fifty miles at the same time.  The speed at which they were approaching one another was, however, approximately one hundred and forty miles an hour, or more than two miles a minute.  What, under ordinary circumstances, would have been a safe distance became a danger zone, and before either pilot realized his mistake it was too late to steer clear.  The scene of the accident lay over a part of the field where Wright’s Barn stands.  This little red building was the workshop of the Wright brothers when they astonished the world by their first aerial flights. To-day that little red barn stands as a monument to American stupidity, for when we allowed the Wrights to go abroad to perfect their ideas instead of aiding them to carry on their work at home, we lost a golden opportunity.  Now the United States, which gave to the world the first practical aeroplane, is the least advanced in this all-important science.  Although I came to Pau with a little preliminary experience, and had the \"feel\" for engines and steering, I was obliged to begin, with the others, at the bottom of the primary class.  It was nearly two months before I was allowed to make my first flight.  The French idea is that before a pupil commences his apprenticeship as a pilot he must understand thoroughly the machine he is going to handle and know just what he is trying to do in the air.  Together with twenty-five other men, who began their studies at about the same time, I was ordered to attend the theoretical courses.  When not in the classroom we were stationed on the aviation-field where we could watch the more advanced \"élèves\" fly, thus familiarizing ourselves by observation with all the details of our profession.  Class-room work and field-practice go hand in hand.  At first I did not realize how important these courses were, or how strict was the discipline under which we lived.  One day, when my thoughts were a little more intent upon an expected week-end at Biarritz than upon what was being explained on the blackboard, the lecturer suddenly asked me a question.  I could not answer and forthwith my forty-eight-hour leave was retracted.  My Sunday was spoiled, but I considered myself lucky not to have received a \"consigne,\" which involves sleeping in the guard-house every night for a week.  The first subject we took up was mechanics. We were made to mount and dismount motors, and were familiarized with every part of their construction.  Carburetors and magnetos came next, and then we learned what made a motor \"go.\"  At the front a pilot always has two \"mecaniciens\" to take care of his machine, but if on account of a breakdown he should have to land in hostile territory he must be able to make the necessary repairs himself, and make them quickly, or else run the risk of being taken prisoner.  When flying, the pilot can usually tell by the sound of his motor whether it is running perfectly or not. Many a life has been saved in this way—the pilot knowing in time what was out of order before being forced to land in a forest, on a mountain peak, or in some other equally impossible place.  When we had become \"apt,\" we were promoted to a course in aeroplane construction. This is an extremely technical course, and at first we were asked to know only simple subjects, such as the incidence of the wings, the angle of attack of the cellule, the carrying force of the tail in reference to the size of the propeller.  By the incidence of the wings is meant their upward slope.  This is an extremely important matter, for the stability and climbing propensities of the machine depend entirely upon their model.  The angle of attack of the cellule is the angle of the different wings in reference to each other.  For instance, the incidence of one side must be greater than that of the other on account of the rotary movement of the propeller.  There are also certain fixed ratios between the upper and lower planes.  Still more important is the carrying power of the tailplane, for if it has too much incidence it lifts the rear end and makes the machine dive, while if it has too little the reverse happens.  If any part of the aeroplane is not correctly regulated it becomes dangerous and difficult for the pilot to control. All this becomes more important as one reaches the close of the apprenticeship. One then appreciates this intimate knowledge acquired at the school.  Often a pilot is compelled to land in a field many miles from his base.  If something is wrong with his motor he must be able to find out immediately what the trouble is, for if a part is broken the camp must be called up on the telephone, so that a new piece may be sent to the spot by motor, with a mechanic to adjust it.  When a pilot starts on a cross-country trip he is always given blank requisitions, signed by his commanding officer.  When he is forced to land he therefore is able to call upon authorities, whether military or civilian, for any service or assistance he may need, and this \"scrap of paper\" is sufficient in every case to obtain food, lodging, and even transportation to the nearest aviation headquarters for both the pilot and his machine.  [Illustration: The little café across the road]  Map-reading and navigation were the next subjects we studied.  First we were taught how to read a map, how to judge the height of hills and the size of towns, so that when flying we would know at a glance just where we were.  This, we later appreciated, is a very important matter. When passing through clouds or mist an aviator may become momentarily lost, and the instant he again sees the ground he must locate on his map the country he views or else land and ask where he is. Aerial"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46299"],["title","With the French Flying Corps (#2)"],["body","may not be as complicated as that employed by mariners upon the high seas, but it is not easily mastered by any means.  One must learn to calculate the direction a straight line takes between two points, and translate this direction into degrees on the compass.  Secondly, and more important, is the estimation of the drift caused by the wind.  If the wind is from the west and the pilot is attempting to go north, the machine will go \"en crabe\" (sideways like a crab).  The machine will be pointing north by the compass, but in reality it will be moving northeast.  After the pilot has laid out his course on the map, and is tearing through the air, he must immediately take into consideration his drift. By watching landmarks selected beforehand the drift is calculated very quickly. The course by the compass is altered, and, though the machine is speeding due north, the compass informs the pilot that he is pointing northwest, a fact very confusing for a beginner.                                *LEARNING TO FLY*   During the lecture course we always spent several hours a day on the aviation-field.  We were not allowed to fly, but our presence was insisted upon. We would observe the things to avoid, so that when our turn came to go up we should be familiar with all the dangers. Every start, flight, and landing was made a subject of special study.  Every time a pupil made a mistake his fault was explained to us, and we were usually impressed with the fact that he had barely escaped a bad smash and perhaps death. The pupils who made the mistakes, were immediately made examples.  If the fault was corrected they escaped with a long and loud lecture for the benefit of the onlookers, but if, on the other hand, an accident followed the mistake the offenders were immediately punished with a ten days’ \"consigne.\"  If a pupil continued to make mistakes he was \"vidé,\" and sent back to his former regiment.  Loss of speed—\"perte de vitesse,\" the French call it—is the most common and probably the greatest danger an aviator meets with—it is his \"bête noire.\"  There is a minimum speed capable of holding an aeroplane in the air which varies inversely with the spread of the wings.  While in line of flight, the force of the motor will maintain the speed, but when the motor is shut off and the pilot commences to volplane the force of gravity produces the same result.  There are two ways of knowing when you are approaching the danger-point—by closely watching the speed-indicator and by feeling your controls.  The moment the controls become lifeless and have no resistance you must act instinctively and regain your momentum, or it is all up with you.  While climbing you may lose speed by forcing the motor and climbing too rapidly.  When a \"perte de vitesse\" is produced the aeroplane \"goes off on the wing,\" sliding down sideways in such a manner and with such force that the rudders cannot right you or that the propeller cannot pick up your forward speed.  This can happen also if, when making a vertical turn, the speed is not sufficiently increased to carry you around the corner.  Occurring near the ground a loss of speed is certain to result in a smash-up. If high in the air a \"vrille,\" or tail spin, is generally the result.  By this is meant coming down in a whirlpool, spinning like a match in the waste of a basin.  The machine takes as a pivot the corner of one wing and revolves about it.  The first turn is very slow, but the speed increases with each revolution.  The only hope of escape is to dive into the centre of the whirlpool.  Even then, if the motor is turned on, the planes will fold up like a book.  Among the accidents to beginners this, next to faulty landing, is the most common.  [Illustration: A Morane-Parasol.]  I witnessed one very sad example.  A young lieutenant had just been brevetted and was ready to leave the school.  Just as he was saying good-by to his comrades, a \"Morane Parasol\" was brought out on the field.  These machines are very tricky and dangerous.  He had never piloted one, but wanted to show off.  The monitors begged him not to take it up, but he insisted on doing so.  When he had reached an altitude of about five hundred metres he shut off his motor to come down, not realizing that monoplanes do not volplane well.  He did not dive enough and had a \"perte de vitesse.\"  The machine slipped off the wing.  We all held our breaths and prayed that he would recover control before he engaged in the fatal corkscrew spiral.  Our hopes were of no avail.  The machine started to turn, and approached the earth spinning like a chip caught in a whirlpool.  I turned my back, but I could hear the machine whistling through the air till it came to the ground with a sickening crash.  Faulty landings are also very common causes of accidents.  It takes a beginner a long time to train his eye to make a perfect landing, and even experienced men now and then smash up on the \"atterrissage.\"  A few inches sometimes make a great difference.  If the pilot does not check his speed in time he will crash into the ground and \"capote,\" that is, turn over.  If he pulls up too soon he will slip off on the wing or land so hard that the machine collapses.  Not only the manner of landing but gaining the exact place of landing is difficult.  If the pilot misjudges his distance, and lands either beyond or short of a given spot, he may collide with some object that will wreck the aeroplane.  Just before leaving the ground is another critical moment.  If the tail is lifted too high in an effort to gain speed the wheels are liable to hit some small obstacle and the machine turns a somersault.  Often one is forced to lift the tail very high to gain flying speed in a short distance, and it always results in an uncomfortable few seconds until the pilot knows he is clear. Still another mishap against which aviators are powerless may occur while rolling along the ground.  The machine may be caught by a cross wind, which will turn it completely around, a \"chevaux-de-bois,\" a merry-go-round, the French call it.  If the machine is going fast when this happens it means touching the ground with a wing and a first-class smash.  For two months I studied and watched, and the result was a profound respect for the air.  During this time it seems that I also had been the object of study and observation on the part of my teachers, for one day I was told that I was to receive my \"baptême de l’air,\" my first flight as a passenger.  Words cannot describe my joy or my sensations.  I walked over to the double-seater.  The pilot had already taken his seat, and the propeller was turning.  I had hardly climbed in and fastened my belt than we were off.  I could hear the wheels bounding along the ground.  Suddenly the noise stopped—we were in the air.  I was sure I would have vertigo, as I often had had in high places.  I did not look out of the machine until we were about five hundred feet up.  Then, to my surprise, I experienced not the slightest sensation of height. The ground seemed to be merely moving slowly under and away from me.  We kept climbing.  I could see the country for miles.  Never had I viewed the horizon from so far.  The snow-clad Pyrenees were literally at my feet.  Trees looked like weeds and roads like white ribbons.  It was a marvellous sight.  At about two thousand feet we struck some wind and \"remous\" (whirlpools).  Each time we struck one we would drop about fifty feet, and the sensation was like being in a descending express elevator.  At the end of the drop we would stop, the biplane would shiver and roll like a ship in a heavy sea, and then it would shoot up until we struck the solid air again.  This was real flying.  After a while my instructor cut off the motor, and we started to come down.  We were going fast enough on the level, but now the wind just roared past my ears.  The ground appeared to be rushing up to meet us. We were pointing down so straight that my whole weight was on my feet, and I was literally standing up.  I thought that the pilot had forgotten to redress, and that we would go head first into the ground, but he finally pulled up, and before I knew it we were rolling along the ground at a speed of about forty miles an hour.  With this preliminary experience I was ready to commence my final studies for a pilot’s brevet.  Some people seem to think that the two months devoted merely to first principles are time lost, but I now realize that this is not so.  I seemed to have much more confidence on account of this intelligent understanding of every detail.  I felt that I knew just what I was to avoid, and just how to do the correct thing in case an emergency arose.  Perhaps I might say here that military aviators have four distinct duties to perform at the front: they must fight, reconnoitre the enemy’s positions, control the fire of their own batteries, or make distant bombarding raids over the enemy’s bases of supplies.  The fighting pilots do nothing but combat work.  Their machines are the very small and fast Nieuports, designed especially for quick manoeuvring.  They are called the \"appareils de chasse,\" on account of their great speed—over one hundred miles an hour.  Their armament consists of a mitrailleuse, which is carried in a fixed position.  In order to aim it, the pilot must point his machine.  The principal task assigned to the Nieuports is to do sentry duty over our own lines, in order to prevent the enemy aeroplanes from crossing over for observation purposes.  Heavier and somewhat slower, and too cumbersome for fighting, are the machines used for reconnoissance duty.  They are large bimotor Caudrons, very stable and capable of carrying two men, an observer and a pilot. In addition they carry a wireless apparatus, powerful photographing instruments, and other equipment essential to their work of observing, recording, and reporting the enemy’s movements and the disposition of his batteries.  If attacked, they can"]]]
