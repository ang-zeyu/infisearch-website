After receiving refreshment at his hospitable board, we commenced a conversation which lasted till a late hour, which appeared satisfactory to the whole family.  The next morning I accompanied the reverend gentleman to his chapel, and at the hour appointed commenced to preach to a crowded congregation on the principles of salvation. I likewise preached in the afternoon and evening, and my hearers seemed to manifest great interest in the things which I laid before them. Nearly the whole congregation shed tears of joy.  After I had concluded the services of the day, Mr. Richards gave out another appointment for me to preach on Monday evening, which I attended to. I likewise, by request of the congregation, preached on Wednesday evening.  A number now began to believe the doctrines I advanced, and on Thursday, six individuals, all members of Mr. Richards' church, came forward for baptism.  Mr. Richards now, seeing the effect which my preaching produced, and fearing lest he should lose all his members and likewise the salary which was allowed him for preaching, told me that he must close the doors of his chapel against me; but at the same time his behavior was kind, and to his praise be it spoken, treated me with the greatest hospitality.  I then began to preach in private houses, which were opened in that neighborhood, and I ceased not to declare to all who came to hear, both by night and by day, the glorious tidings of salvation, and that God had again restored the ordinances as at the first, and counselors as at the beginning.  Notwithstanding Mr. Richards closed the door of his meeting house against me, he frequently came to hear me preach.  His daughter felt very sorrowful on account of her father not allowing me to preach any more in his place of worship, and wept much; but I told her not to fear, for I believed that God would soften his heart and cause him to open his chapel for me to preach in again.  During this time I was principally entertained at his house. The next Sunday I went along with him to his meeting, feeling a desire to hear him preach. After he had finished his discourse, I was surprised to hear him give out another appointment for me to preach in his chapel. I accordingly preached in the afternoon and in the evening, and the word seemed to be with power and the effect was great upon the people. The next day I baptized two more, both members of Mr. Richards' church.  Mr. Richards had preached in that place upwards of thirty years, and his members, as well as the inhabitants of the place and vicinity, were very much attached to him. Yet, when the fullness of the gospel was preached, although in much weakness, the people, notwithstanding their attachment and regard for their venerable pastor, being convinced of their duty, came forward and followed the footsteps of the Savior by being buried in the likeness of His death.  After laboring for some time in this neighborhood, I was warned by the Spirit to return to Preston, and there found that I was anxiously expected by the brethren. They had received letters from Brothers Richards and Russell, which gave an account of their proceedings since they left Preston. Brother Goodson had also returned from Bedfordshire, where he and Brother Richards had labored, and he gave us a relation of their mission and success. He informed us that a minister by the name of Matthews, brother-in-law to Elder Joseph Fielding, received them very kindly and invited them to preach in his church. The invitation was accepted, and they preached several times. The result was that a number, among whom was Mr. Matthews and his lady, believed their testimony and the things which they proclaimed. Mr. Matthews had likewise borne testimony to his congregation of the truth of these things and that they were the same principles as taught by the apostles in ancient days, and beseeched his church to receive the same. Several of his members went forward and obeyed the gospel, and the time was appointed when he was to be baptized. However, in the interval, something had caused him to stumble, and darkness had pervaded his mind, insomuch so that at the time specified he did not make his appearance, but went to a Baptist minister residing in that place whom he prevailed upon to baptize him. From that time he began to preach baptism for the remission of sins, and no longer walked with the Saints. However, a great part of his members left him and obeyed the truth, and in a letter which he wrote to his brother-in-law, the Rev. James Fielding, he stated that his best members had left him.  It would probably be well to say a few words respecting Mr. Matthews and Mr. Fielding, and their congregations, also their situation prior to the time the gospel saluted their ears.  Mr. Matthews, who was a gentleman of considerable learning and talents, had been a minister in the established church of England. Seeing a great many things in that church contrary to truth and righteousness, and moreover, believing that an overturn was at hand, and that the church was destitute of the gifts of the Spirit, and was not expecting the Savior to come to reign upon the earth, as had been spoken by the prophets, he felt led to withdraw from that body.  He consequently gave up his prospects in that connection, and began to preach the things which he verily believed; and was instrumental in raising up quite a church in that place.  Mr. J. Fielding had been a minister in the Methodist church, but for some of the causes mentioned, had withdrawn from that society, and had collected a considerable church in Preston. Those gentlemen, with their congregations, were, I believe, diligently contending for that faith which was once delivered to the Saints at the time we arrived, but afterwards rejected the truth. Yet, notwithstanding they did not obey the gospel, the greater portion of their members received our testimony, obeyed the ordinances we taught, and are now rejoicing in the blessings of the new and everlasting covenant.    CHAPTER IV.  THE PEOPLE EAGER TO HEAR US--WE RENT \"THE COCK PIT\" TO PREACH IN--OBTAIN LICENSES TO PREACH--CONTINUED SUCCESS.  About this time, Brother Snider returned from the north, where he had been laboring in company with Brother Russell. He stated that they had met with considerable opposition while preaching the gospel, but that some had obeyed the truth and that others were investigating.  After spending a few days with us, he and Brother Goodson took their leave of us and started for Liverpool about the first of October, on their way to America, having business of importance which called them home.  Although we were deprived of the labors of these brethren, the work of the Lord continued to roll forth with great power. The news of our arrival in that city, spread both far and wide, and calls from all quarters, to go and preach, were constantly sounding in our ears. We labored both night and day, that we might satisfy the people, who manifested such a desire for the truth as I never saw before.  We had to speak in small houses, to very large congregations, or else, to large assemblies in the open air; consequently, our lungs were very sore and our bodies considerably worn down with fatigue.  Soon after this, we obtained a large and commodious place to preach in, called \"The Cock Pit,\" which had formerly been used by the people to witness cocks fight and kill one another, and where hundreds of spectators had shouted in honor of the barbarous sport which was once the pride of Britains. And now, instead of the huzzas of the wicked and profane, the gospel of Christ and the voice of praise and thanksgiving was heard there. The building had also been used for a temperance hall.  We had to pay seven shillings sterling per week for the use of it, and two shillings per week for the lighting, it being beautifully lit up with gas. It is situated in the center of the town, and about twenty rods from the \"old church,\" probably the oldest in Lancashire. This church has twelve bells which are rung at every service, the noise of which was so great that we were unable to proceed in our services until they had done ringing them.  Our meeting was once disturbed by some ministers belonging to the Methodist church; however we got our place licensed and two gentlemen, who were constables, proffered their services to keep the peace and protect us from any further disturbances, which they continued to do, as long as we stayed in that land.  The effect of the gospel of Jesus Christ now began to be apparent, not only in the hearts of believers, but likewise in the conduct of those who rejected it and many began to threaten us with prosecution for preaching without having a license from the authorities of the nation.  This idea of obtaining a license from the secular authorities was somewhat novel to us, but after consulting our friends, among whom was Mr. Richards' son, (the minister of whom I have made mention) an attorney, practicing in that neighborhood, we found that it was according to the laws of the land.  Brother Hyde and I then made application to the quarter sessions for licenses and, by the assistance of Mr. Richards, obtained them.  Having now obeyed the requisitions of the law, we felt ourselves tolerably safe, knowing that our enemies now could not lawfully make us afraid or harm us.  Although we had many persecutors, who would have rejoiced at our destruction and who felt a determination to overthrow the work of the Lord, there were many who were very friendly, who would have stood by us under all circumstances, and would not have been afraid to hazard their lives in our behalf.  After we had labored for some time in Preston, and had baptized a number into the kingdom of God, Brother Hyde and I went about ten miles into the country to preach, agreeably to an invitation we had received.

Kimball's Journal (#5)"],["body","twice to very numerous congregations, who paid great attention to our word, and who marveled at the things we proclaimed. We soon returned to Preston after which I paid a visit to the church at Walker Fold, that being the name of the place where the Rev. Mr. Richards resided. I found the church prospering, and after laboring a few days, several more were added. From that place I went to Bashe Lees, where I preached, and baptized two persons. I continued my journey thence to Ribchester, situated on the river Ribble, where I preached to a very large congregation, and then returned to Preston.  Having had some very pressing calls to go to some villages south of Preston, I accordingly started to visit those places, in company with Brother F. Moon, who had been baptized a short time previous. On arriving at our destination we gave out an appointment to preach, and, at the time appointed, the people flocked in crowds to hear me. Among the number were five preachers, who listened with great interest to my discourse, and who, with the greater part of the congregation, believed the doctrines I advanced.  The next day I went to a village called Askin, and preached in the evening; and the following day went to Eccleston, where I had the privilege of preaching in a Methodist chapel. The last three times I preached I baptized ten individuals, of whom two were preachers belonging to the Association Methodists.  After spending several days in that neighborhood I returned to Preston, where the church had now become numerous, and with the assistance of Elders Hyde and Fielding, proceeded to organize them. We divided the church into several branches, and appointed proper officers to preside over them.  Thursday evenings were appointed for prayer meetings to be held in different parts, and Sundays for the whole church to assemble in the Cock Pit, where the sacrament was administered, and such instructions given as were thought necessary for their spiritual prosperity and advantage.  While attending to this, the greatest harmony and love prevailed; and if ever any persons received the kingdom of heaven like little children it was those brethren.  After having attended to this duty, I again went into the country, where I spent the principal part of my time, occasionally visiting Preston.  During my labors, I was greatly assisted by the Spirit of the Lord, and my soul was comforted exceedingly. Churches were raised up in different directions, and many who had previously sat in darkness, upon them the true light shined, and before its benign and enlightening rays, the mists of darkness, the clouds of error and superstition fled; while \"those who murmured learned doctrine, and those who erred in spirit came to understanding.\"  I was instrumental in building up churches in Eccleston, Wrightington, Askin, Exton, Daubers Lane, Chorly, Whittle and Laland Moss, after laboring about four weeks, and baptized upwards of one hundred persons, which caused me to rejoice exceedingly in the God and Rock of my salvation, that I had not to labor in vain, or spend my strength for nought. More loving and affectionate Saints I never saw before, and they were patterns of humility.  All the here-mentioned villages are within a very short distance of each other, and adjacent to Preston.  After my return from those places, I took a tour to the north-east of Preston in company with Elder Fielding, where we labored together a short time with considerable success, and raised up churches in Ribchester, Thomly, Soney Gate Lane and at Clitheroe, a very large market town, containing several thousand inhabitants.  At the latter place I baptized a preacher and six members of the Methodist church, immediately after I had preached the first time. We likewise baptized several in the town of Waddington and Downham.  The day after we preached in Downham, we received a very pressing invitation to preach in Chatburn, but having given out an appointment to preach in Clitheroe that evening, I informed those who had invited me that I would not be able to comply with their request. This did not satisfy them, and they continued to solicit me with the greatest importunity, until I was obliged to consent to go with them, after requesting Elder Fielding to attend to the other appointment.  On my arrival at the village I was cordially received by the inhabitants, who turned out in large numbers to hear me preach. I commenced my address to them in my usual manner, and the spirit of the Lord seemed to carry the word to the hearts of the congregation, who listened with great attention, and received the ingrafted word, which was able to make them wise unto salvation.  Being satisfied in my mind, from the witness of the spirit, that numbers were believing, I gave an opportunity to those who wished to obey the gospel to do so, and immediately repaired to the water, although it was late in the evening. Before I was done I baptized twenty-five for the remission of their sins, and was engaged in this pleasing duty until one o'clock, the next morning.  After being absent from Preston about seven days, in which time we had added eighty-three souls to the Church, we returned, praising God for all His mercies, and for visiting our labors with such abundant success.    \"No harvest joy can equal theirs   Who see the fruit of all their cares.\"    CHAPTER V.  FIRST CONFERENCE IN ENGLAND--WORD OF WISDOM FIRST TAUGHT THERE--ENEMIES ACTIVE--URGENT INVITATION FROM A BAPTIST CHURCH--THE EFFECT OF OUR PREACHING.  It being near Christmas, we agreed to hold a general conference in Preston on Christmas day, there being business of importance to the churches to be attended to; and likewise several to be ordained to the ministry.  On Christmas day, the Saints assembled in the Cock Pit, and we then opened the conference, which was the first that was held by the Church of Christ in that country. There were about three hundred Saints present on the occasion, all of whom with the exception of three had been baptized within a very short time. Elders Hyde, Fielding and myself were present.  The brethren were instructed in the principles of the gospel, and their several duties enjoined upon them, as Saints of the Most High. We then proceeded to ordain several of the brethren to the Lesser Priesthood, to take charge of the different branches where they resided. We confirmed fourteen who had previously been baptized, and blessed about one hundred children.  At this conference, the Word of Wisdom was first publicly taught in that country; having previously taught it more by example than precept; and, from my own observation afterwards, I am happy to state that it was almost universally attended to by the brethren.  The Spirit of the Lord was with us during our interview, and truly the hearts of the Elders were rejoiced beyond measure when we contemplated the glorious work which had begun. We had to exclaim, \"It is the Lord's doings, and it is marvelous in our eyes! Blessed be the name of the Lord!\"  I felt greatly humbled before the Lord, who had crowned our labors with such signal success, and had prospered us far beyond my most sanguine expectations.  Immediately after this conference, Elder Hyde and I went to a village called Longton, situated near the sea-shore, where we raised the standard of truth, and published to the listening crowds, the glad tidings of salvation. After delivering two discourses, several came to us and requested baptism. It being very cold weather, insomuch that the streams were all frozen up, we had to repair to the sea-shore to administer that ordinance, and immersed fifteen in the waters of the ocean.  It would probably be too tedious, to enumerate all the particulars which occurred during the time we sojourned in that country; I shall therefore pass over many events which, though pleasing to us at that time, and which showed the kind dealings of our Heavenly Father, would not be sufficiently interesting to others. I shall therefore content myself by giving an outline of the principal circumstances attending our mission, which I have no doubt will be pleasing to the brethren, and to all who love the prosperity of Zion.  From this time, until about five weeks previous to our departure from that land, we were continually engaged in the work of the ministry, proclaiming the everlasting gospel in all the region round about, and baptizing all such as believed the gospel and repented of their sins. And truly, \"the Lord of Hosts was with us, the God of Jacob was our refuge.\" The Holy Ghost the Comforter was given to us and abode with us in a remarkable manner, while the people thronged to hear our addresses, and \"numbers were added to the church daily, such as should be saved.\" We would baptize as many as fifty in Preston in a week, exclusive of those in the country. During one short mission which Brother Hyde and I took into the country, after preaching five discourses on the principles of our holy religion, we had the pleasure of immersing one hundred and thirty in the waters of baptism.  Thus mightily ran the word of God and prospered to the joy and comfort of His servants, and to the salvation of precious and immortal souls; while the world was struck with amazement and surprise at the things which they saw and heard. During this state of things, our enemies were not idle, but heaped abuse upon us with an unsparing hand, and issued torrents of lies after us, which, however, I am thankful to say, did not sweep us away.  Among those most active in publishing falsehoods against us and the truth, were many of the reverend clergy, who were afraid to meet us face to face in honorable debate, although particularly requested so to do, but sought every opportunity to destroy our characters, and propagate their lies concerning us, thus giving testimony that \"they loved darkness rather than light.\"  Although we frequently called upon the ministers of the different denominations, who had taken a"]]]
