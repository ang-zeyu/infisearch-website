At first they had tried living in the barracks, but after a time every one in the officers' quarters rose in revolt at the pranks of those graceless children, so Captain Woolcot took a house some distance up the Parramatta River, and in considerable bitterness of spirit removed his family there.  They liked the change immensely; for there was a big wilderness of a garden, two or three paddocks, numberless sheds for hide-and-seek, and, best of all, the water.  Their father kept three beautiful horses, one at he barracks and a hunter and a good hack at Misrule; so, to make up, the children--not that they cared in the slightest--went about in shabby, out-at-elbow clothes, and much-worn boots.  They were taught--all but Pip, who went to the grammar school--by a very third-class daily governess, who lived in mortal fear of her ignorance being found out by her pupils.  As a matter of fact, they had found her out long ago, as children will, but it suited them very well not to be pushed on and made to work, so they kept the fact religiously to themselves.     CHAPTER II  Fowl for Dinner     \"Oh, don't the days seem lank and long   When all goes right and nothing wrong;   And isn't your life extremely flat   With nothing whatever to grumble at?\"  I hope you are not quite deafened yet, for though I have got through the introductions, tea is not nearly finished, so we must stay in the nursery a little longer: All the time I have been talking Pip has been grumbling at the lack of good things.  The table was not very tempting, certainly; the cloth looked as if it had been flung on, the china was much chipped and battered, the tea was very weak, and there was nothing to eat but great thick slices of bread and butter.  Still, it was the usual tea, and everyone seemed surprised at Pip's outburst.  \"My father and Esther\" (they all called their young stepmother by her Christian name) \"are having roast fowl, three vegetables, and four kinds of pudding,\" he said angrily; \"it isn't fair!\"  \"But we had dinner at one o'clock, Pip, and yours is saved as usual,\" said Meg, pouring out tea with a lavish allowance of hot water and sugar.  \"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!\" returned her brother witheringly.  \"Why shouldn't we have roast fowl and custard and things?\"  \"Yes, why shouldn't we?\" echoed little greedy Bunty; his eyes lighting up.  \"What a lot it would take for all of us!\" said Meg, cheerfully attacking the bread loaf.  \"We're only children--let us be thankful for this nice thick bread and this abundance of melting butter,\" said Judy, in a good little tone.  Pip pushed his chair back from the table.  \"I'm going down to ask for some roast fowl,\" he said, with a look of determination in his eyes.  \"I can't forget the smell of it, and they'd got a lot on the table--I peeped in the door.\"  He took up his plate and proceeded downstairs, returning presently, to the surprise of everyone, with quite a large portion on his plate.  \"He couldn't very well refuse,\" he chuckled.  \"Colonel Bryant is there; but he looked a bit mad--here, Fizz, I'll go you halves.\"  Judy pushed up her plate eagerly at this unusually magnanimous offer, and received a very small division, a fifth part, perhaps, with great gratitude.  \"I just LOVE fowl,\" said Nell longingly; \"I've a great mind to go down and ask for a wing--I believe he'd give it to me.\"  These disrespectful children, as I am afraid you will have noticed, always alluded to their father as \"he.\"  Nell took up another plate, and departed slowly to the lower regions.  She followed into the dining-room at the heels of the housemaid, and stood by the side of her father, her plate well behind her.  \"Well, my little maid, won't you shake hands with me?  What is your name?\" said Colonel Bryant, tapping her cheek playfully.  Nell looked up with shy, lovely eyes.  \"Elinor Woolcot, but they call me Nell,\" she said, holding out her left hand, since her right was occupied with the plate.  \"What a little barbarian you are, Nell!\" laughed her father; but he gave her a quick, annoyed glance.  \"Where is your right hand?\"  She drew it slowly from behind and held out the cracked old plate. \"I thought perhaps you would give me some fowl too,\" she said--\"just a leg or a wing, or bit of breast would do.\"  The Captain's brow darkened.  \"What is the meaning of this?  Pip has just been to me, too.  Have you nothing to eat in the nursery?\"  \"Only bread and butter, very thick,\" sighed Nellie.  Esther suppressed a smile with difficulty.  \"But you had dinner, all of you, at one o'clock.\"  \"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding,\" said Nell mournfully.  Captain Woolcot severed a leg almost savagely and put it on her plate.  \"Now run away; I don't know what has possessed you two to-night.\"  Nellie reached the door, then turned back.  \"Oh, if you would just give me a wing for poor Meg--Judy had some of Pip's, but Meg hasn't any,\" she said, with a beautiful look of distress that quite touched Colonel Bryant.  Her father bit his lip, hacked off a wing in ominous silence, and put it upon her plate.  \"Now run away,--and don't let me have any more of this nonsense, dear.\"  The last word was a terrible effort.  Nell's appearance with the two portions of fowl was hailed with uproarious applause in the nursery; Meg was delighted with her share; cut a piece off for Baby, and the meal went on merrily.  \"Where's Bunty?\", said Nell, pausing suddenly with a very clean drumstick in her fingers, \"because I HOPE he hasn't gone too; someway I don't think Father was very pleased, especially as that man was there.\"  But that small youth had done so, and returned presently crestfallen.  \"He wouldn't give me any--he told me to go away, and the man laughed, and Esther said we were very naughty--I got some feathered potatoes, though, from the table outside the door.\"  He opened his dirty little hands and dropped the uninviting feathered delicacy out upon the cloth.  \"Bunty, you're a pig,\" sighed Meg, looking up from her book. She always read at the table, and this particular story was about some very refined, elegant girls.  \"Pig yourself--all of you've had fowl but me, you greedy things!\" retorted Bunty fiercely, and eating up his potato very fast.  \"No, the General hasn't,\" said Judy and the old mischief light sprang up suddenly into her dark eyes.  \"Now, Judy!\" said Meg warningly; she knew too well what that particular sparkle meant.  \"Oh, I'm not going to hurt you, you dear old thing,\" said Miss Judy, dancing down the room and bestowing a pat on her sister's fair head as she passed.  \"It's only the General, who's after havin' a bit o' fun.\"  She lifted him up out of the high chair, where he had been sitting drumming on the table with a spoon and eating sugar in the intervals.  \"It's real action you're going for to see, General,\" she said, dancing to the door with him.  \"Oh, Judy, what are you going to do?\" said Meg entreatingly.  \"Ju-Ju!\" crowed the General, leaping almost out of Judy's arms, and scenting fun with the instinct of a veteran.  Down the passage they went, the other five behind to watch proceedings.  Judy sat down with him on the last step.  \"Boy want chuck-chuck, pretty chuck-chuck?\" she said insidiously.  \"Chuck-chuck, chuck-a-chuck,\" he gurgled, looking all around for his favourite friends.  \"Dad got lots--all THIS many,\" said Judy, opening her arms very wide to denote the number in her father's possession.  \"Boydie, go get them!\"  \"Chuck-chuck,\" crowed the General delightedly, and struggling to his feet--\"find chuck-chuck.\"  \"In there,\" whispered Judy, giving him a gentle push into the half-open dining-room door; \"ask Dad.\"  Right across the room the baby tottered on fat, unsteady little legs.  \"Are the children ALL possessed to-night, Esther?\" said the Captain, as his youngest son clutched wildly at his leg and tried to climb up it.  He looked down into the little dirty, dimpling face.  \"Well, General, and to what do we owe the honour of your presence?\"  \"Chuck-chuck, chuck-a-chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck,\" said the General, going down promptly upon all fours to seek for the feathered darlings Judy had said were here.  But Esther gathered up the dear, dirty-faced young rascal and bore him struggling out of the room.  At the foot of the stairs she nearly stumbled over the rest of the family.  \"Oh, you scamps, you bad, wicked imps!\" she said, reaching out to box all their ears, and of course failing.  She sat down on the bottom stair to laugh for a second, then she handed the General to Pip.  \"To-morrow,\" she said, standing up and hastily smoothing the rich hair that the General's hands had clutched gleefully--\"to-morrow I shall beat every one of you with the broomstick.\"  They watched the train of her yellow' silk dress disappear into the dining-room again, and returned slowly to the nursery and their interrupted tea.     CHAPTER III  Virtue Not Always Rewarded   It was not to be expected that such an occurrence could be passed entirely over, but then again it is difficult to punish seven children at the same time.  At first Captain Woolcot had requested Esther to ask Miss Marsh, the governess, to give them all ten French verbs to learn; but, as Judy pointed out, the General and Baby and Bunty and Nell had not arrived at the dignity of French verbs yet, so such a punishment would be iniquitous. The sentence therefore had not been quite decided upon as yet, and everyone felt in an uncomfortable state of suspense.  \"Your father says you're a disgraceful tribe,\" said the young stepmother slowly, sitting down on the nursery rocking-chair a day later.  She had on a trailing morning wrapper of white muslin with cherry ribbons, but there was a pin doing duty for a button in one or two places and the lace was hanging off a bit at the sleeve.  \"Meg, dear, you're very untidy, you know, and Judy's absolutely hopeless.\"  Meg was attired in an unbecoming green cashmere, with the elbows out and the plush torn off in several"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],["title","Seven Little Australians (#2)"],["body","ces, while Judy's exceedingly scant and faded pink zephyr had rents in several places, and the colour was hardly to be seen for fruit-stains.  Meg coloured a little.  \"I know, Esther, and I'd like to be nicely-dressed as well as anyone, but it really isn't worth mending these old things.\"  She picked up her book about the elegant girls who were disturbing her serenity and went over to the armchair with it.  \"Well, Judy, you go and sew up those rents, and put some buttons on your frock.\"  Esther spoke with unusual determination.  Judy's eyes snapped and sparkled.  \"'Is that a dagger that I see before me, the handle to my hand? Come, let me grasp it,'\" she said saucily, snatching one of the pins from Esther's dress, fastening her own with it, and dropping a curtsey.  Esther reddened a little now.  \"That's the General, Judy: he always pulls the buttons off my wrappers when I play with him.  But I'm forgetting.  Children, I have bad news for you.\"  There was a breathless silence.  Everyone crowded round her knees.  \"Sentence has been proclaimed,\" said Judy dramatically: \"let us shave our heads and don sackcloth.\"  \"Your father says he cannot allow such conduct to go unpunished, especially as you have all been unusually tiresome lately; therefore: you are all--\"  \"To be taken away and hanged by the neck until we are dead!\"  \"Be quiet, Judy.  I have tried my best to beg you off, but it only makes him more vexed.  He says you are the untidiest, most unruly lot of children in Sydney, and he will punish you each time you do anything, and--\"  \"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"  \"Oh, shut up, Judy!  Can't you let us hear?\"  Pip put his hand over her mouth and held her by the hair while Esther told the news.  \"None of you are to go to the pantomime.  The seats were taken for Thursday night, and now, you very foolish children, you will all have to stay at home.\"  There was a perfect howl of dismay for a minute or two.  They had all been looking forward to this treat for nearly a month, and the disappointment was a really bitter one to them all.  \"Oh, I say, Esther, that's too bad, really!  All the fellows at school have been.\"  Pip's handsome face flushed angrily.  \"And for such a little thing, too!\"  \"Just because you had roast fowl for dinner,\" said Judy, in a half-choked voice.  \"Oh, Esther, why couldn't you have had cow, or horse, or hippopotamus--anything but roast fowl?\"  \"Couldn't you get round him, Esther?\"  Meg looked anxiously at her.  \"Dear Esther, do!\"  \"Oh, you sweet, beautiful Essie, do try!\"  They clung round her eagerly.  Baby flung her arms round her neck and nearly choked her; Nell stroked her cheek; Pip patted her back, and besought her to \"be a good fellow\"; Bunty buried his nose in her back hair and wept a silent tear; Meg clasped her hand in an access of unhappiness; the General gave a series of delighted squeaks; and Judy in her wretchedness smacked him for his pains.  Esther would do her best, beg as she had never done before, coax, beseech, wheedle, threaten; and they let her go at last with that assurance.  \"Only I'd advise you all to be preternaturally good and quiet all day,\" she said, looking back from the doorway.  \"That would have most effect with him, and he is going to be at home all day.\"  GOOD!  It was absolutely painful to witness the virtue of those children for the rest of the day.  It was holiday-time, and Miss Marsh was away, but not once did the sound of quarrelling, or laughing, or crying fly down to the lower regions.  \"'Citizens of Rome, the eyes of the world are upon you!'\" Judy had said solemnly, and all had promised so to conduct themselves that their father's heart could not fail to be melted.  Pip put on his school jacket, brushed his hair, took a pile of school books, and proceeded to the study where his father was writing letters, and where he was allowed to do his home-lessons.  \"Well, what do you want?\" said the Captain, with a frown.  \"No, it's no good coming to the about that pup, sir--I won't have you keep it.\"  \"I came to study, sir,\" said Pip mildly.  \"I feel I'm a bit backward with my mathematics, so I won't waste all the holidays, when I'm costing you so much in school fees.\"  The Captain gave a little gasp and looked hard at Pip; but the boy's face was so unsmiling and earnest that he was disarmed, and actually congratulated himself that his eldest son was at last seeing the error of his ways.  \"There are those sets of problems in that drawer that I did when I was at school,\" he said graciously.  \"If they are of any use to you, you can get them out.\"  \"Thanks awfully--they will be a great help,\" said Pip gratefully.  He examined them with admiration plainly depicted upon his face.  \"How very clearly and correctly you worked, Father,\" he said with a sigh.  \"I wonder if ever I'll get as good as this!  How old were you, Father, when you did them?\"  \"About your age,\" said the Captain, picking up the papers.  He examined them with his head on one side.  He was rather proud of them, seeing he had utterly forgotten now how to work decimal fractions, and could not have done a quadratic equation to save his life.  \"Still, I don't think you need be quite discouraged, Pip.  I was rather beyond the other boys in my class in these subjects, I remember.  We can't all excel in the same thing, and I'm glad to see you are beginning to realize the importance of work.\"  \"Yes, Father.\"  Meg had betaken herself to the drawing-room, and was sitting on the floor before the music canterbury with scissors, thimble, and a roll of narrow blue ribbon on her knee, and all her father's songs, that he so often complained were falling to pieces, spread out before her.  He saw her once as he passed the door, and looked surprised and pleased.  \"Thank you, Margaret: they wanted it badly.  I am glad you can make yourself useful, after all,\" he said.  \"Yes, Father.\"  Meg stitched on industriously.  He went back to his study, where Pip's head was at a studious, absorbed angle, and pyramids of books and sheaves of paper were on the table.  He wrote two more letters, and there came a little knock at the door.  \"Come in,\" he called; and there entered Nell.  She was carrying very carefully a little tray covered with a snow-white doyley, and on it were a glass of milk and a plate of mulberries.  She placed it before him.  \"I thought perhaps you would like a little lunch, Father,\" she said gently; and Pip was seized with a sudden coughing fit.  \"My DEAR child!\" he said.  He looked at it very thoughtfully.  \"The last glass of milk I had, Nellie, was when I was Pip's age, and was Barlow's fag at Rugby.  It made me ill, and I have never touched it since.\"  \"But this won't hurt you.  You will drink this?\"  She gave him one of her most beautiful looks.  \"I would as soon drink the water the maids wash up in, my child.\" He took a mulberry, ate it, and made a wry face.  \"They're not fit to eat.\"  \"After you've eaten about six you don't notice they're sour,\" she said eagerly.  But he pushed them away.  \"I'll take your word for it.\"  Then he looked at her curiously. \"What made you think of bringing me anything, Nellie?  I don't ever remember you doing so before.\"  \"I thought you might be hungry writing here so long,\" she said gently; and Pip choked again badly, and she withdrew.  Outside in the blazing sunshine Judy was mowing the lawn.  They only kept one man, and, as his time was so taken up with the horses and stable work generally, the garden was allowed to fall into neglect.  More than once the Captain had spoken vexedly of the untidy lawns, and said he was ashamed for visitors to come to the house.  So Judy, brimming over with zeal, armed herself with an abnormally large scythe, and set to work on the long, long grass.  \"Good heavens, Helen! you'll cut your legs off!\" called her father, in an agitated tone.  He had stepped out on to the front veranda for a mild cigar after the mulberry just as she brought her scythe round with an admirable sweep and decapitated a whole army of yellow-helmeted dandelions.  She turned and gave him a beautiful smile.  \"Oh, no, Father!--why, I'm quite a dab at mowing.\"  She gave it another alarming but truly scientific sweep.  \"See that--and th-a-at--and tha-a-a-at!\"  \"Th-a-at\" carried off a fragment of her dress, and \"tha-a-a-at\" switched off the top of a rose-bush; but there are details to everything, of course.  \"Accidents WILL happen, even to the best regulated grass-cutters,\" she said composedly, and raising the scythe for a fresh circle.  \"Stop immediately, Helen!  Why ever can't you go and play quietly with your doll, and not do things like this?\" said her father irascibly.  \"An' I was afther doin' it just to pleasure him,\" she said, apparently addressing the dandelions.  \"Well, it won't 'pleasure him' to have to provide you with cork legs and re-stock the garden,\" he said dryly: \"Put it down.\"  \"Sure, an' it's illigence itsilf this side: you wouldn't be afther leaving half undone, like a man with only one cheek shaved.\"  Judy affected an Irish brogue at intervals, for some occult reason of her own.  \"Sure an' if ye'd jist stip down and examine it yirself, it's quite aisy ye'd be in yer moind.\"  The Captain hid a slight smile in his moustache.  The little girl looked so comical, standing there in her short old pink frock, a broken-brimmed hat on her tangle of dark curls, her eyes sparkling, her face flushed, the great scythe in her hands, and the saucy words on her lips.  He came down and examined it: it was done excellently well, like most of the things miss Judy attempted--mischief always included: and her little black-stockinged legs were still in a good state of preservation.  \"Hum!  Well, you can finish it then, as Pat's busy.  How did you learn to mow, young lady of wonderful accomplishments?\" (he looked at her questioningly); \"and what made you set yourself such a task?\"  Judy gave her curls a quick push off her hot forehead.  \"(A) Faix, it was inborn"]]]
