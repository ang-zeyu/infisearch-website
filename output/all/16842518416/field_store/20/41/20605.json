The little British Army—and mind you, as a result of its South African lessons, it is the best trained, the best led, and the finest body of men that we have ever put into the field in all our history—will get the first move on, and it will chuck itself, like a flinty little pebble, plumb in the middle of the German machinery, and put all its gadgets out of gear!  After that, the German, with his entire lack of initiative, will go to pieces, and we’ll eat him up!\"  Eric’s old Scottish nurse was accustomed to say of him that he was \"aye up in the cloods or doon in the midden.\"  There was no mistaking his whereabouts to-day.  I began to feel the thrill too.  \"Are you going back to the First Battalion?\" I asked.  \"No word of it as yet.  My orders are to stay here and perfect mobilisation arrangements.  The moment the word goes out from the jolly old War Office, we shall be swamped with reservists: we may have to start a recruiting station as well. Great work!  Great work!  So long, old son!  Run home and polish your buttons!\"  He leaped into his car, and disappeared in a cloud of dust—a most characteristic embodiment of the spirit that was flaming in the hearts of all the youth of England and Scotland during that hectic, unforgettable, blissfully ignorant week.  I walked slowly back down the Green Walk, prepared to serve my sentence on the croquet lawn.  It was a perfect summer evening.  Not a leaf stirred: not a bird chirruped.  The shadow of my somewhat square and stocky person preceded me, flatteringly elongated and attenuated by the rays of the setting sun.  Deep and abiding peace seemed to brood upon the land.  Yet all the land, I knew, was making ready for battle.  Well, for my part, I was satisfied.  I was a soldier, a widow man, and a childless man.  I had no farewells to make, no last embraces—  From among the trees on my right I was conscious of a flutter of white, and a murmur of voices.  A man and a woman—no, no, in those days one still talked of boys and girls—were seated side by side on a fallen tree-trunk, with their backs to me.  They did not appear to be concerning themselves with war, or strife, or hostilities of any kind. Their present relation, though decorous enough, appeared to be one of most cordial agreement.  I recognised them both, and passed on discreetly, silently acknowledging the prescience of that aged but perspicacious student of humanity, my Lord of Eskerley.  \"They appear to have found one another all right!\" I said to myself.                                   *CHAPTER IV*                                 *A TRYST*                                     *I*   Marjorie lay prone among the bracken in Craigfoot Wood, with her chin resting on her hands, and her insteps drumming restlessly upon the cool earth.  Below her ran the road.  To her left, beyond the wooded ridge which gave its name to Baronrigg, lay Craigfoot, nestling, like most small Lowland townships, in its own private valley.  To her right, out of sight a mile away, ran the branch line of the railway which served that district, and which had furnished material to local humourists for a generation.  By the roadside, on the edge of the wood, stood the two-seater car which was accustomed to carry the overflow of the Clegg family to church on Sundays, and which Marjorie liked to pretend was her own special property.  She was never so happy as when her arms were up to the elbows in gear-box grease.  There was a good deal of the elemental small boy about Miss Marjorie.  It was four o’clock in the afternoon, and the month was once more August.  The war which was to have been over in a few furious weeks had now been in progress for twelve months.  The memory of the nightmare campaign of the first winter in Flanders had crystallised into a national epic.  And now Kitchener’s Army, having characteristically survived that chaotic but inevitable experiment in improvisation, its preliminary training at home during one of the worst and wettest winters ever known in England, had gone abroad.  Here it had graduated, with first class honours in endurance and cheerfulness, during a season of trench warfare on the Western Front; and was now bracing itself, with incorrigible optimism, for that heroic mess afterwards known as the Battle of Loos.  Everywhere the war was consolidating its position.  On land the Boche, in a determined effort to recoup himself for his losses on the Western swings by a profitable exploitation of the Eastern roundabouts, had just captured Warsaw; and Hindenburg and Ludendorff were gloriously smashing their way through Russian armies in which perhaps one man in ten possessed a rifle.  At sea, the battles of the Falkland Islands and the Dogger Bank had confirmed the German High Seas Fleet in a policy of watchful waiting—not to be broken, save for the disconcerting experiment of Jutland, until the final abject excursion of surrender more than three years later.  Submarines and Zeppelins were beginning to function.  Yarmouth and Lowestoft had been bombed, with _éclat_.  The _Lusitania_ had gone down, with eleven hundred souls; and a certain giant in the Far West was beginning to come out of the ether administered by Teutonic anæsthetists.  At home, the country had settled into its stride; and everyone, in camp, tube, train, and tram, argued—Heavens! how they did argue!—by a simple exercise in simple proportion, that if a mere handful of British soldiers could hold back overwhelmingly superior numbers for a whole winter, what wouldn’t we do to Germany when the new British Army found their feet and got busy with the big push which everybody—friend and foe, be it said—knew was coming in September?  (The possibility that the enemy might have been unsportsmanlike enough to raise a few new armies of his own did not appear to have occurred to anybody in particular.) The life of the citizen was still fairly normal.  Taxicabs were plentiful: theatrical business was booming.  One could still buy practically all that the heart desired, provided one had the price.  The days when everybody would have money, but there would be nothing to buy, were yet to come.  Marjorie’s predominant emotion during the first six months of the war had been that of fierce resentment against having been born a girl.  She felt helpless; and whenever Marjorie felt helpless it made her angry. (That was why she was so frequently angry with her father.)  All round her the youth of her country were on fire, both boys and girls.  Yet the boys were able to stream away to fight, while Marjorie, who was quite as brave, quite as vigorous, and infinitely more capable of leadership than many young men, was debarred by the accident of her sex from doing anything at all.  In the year nineteen-fifteen the great conflict was still regarded as a man’s war: the inevitability of mobilised womanhood had not yet been recognised.  The accepted theory was that men must work and women must weep—for the duration.  The countryside was full of soldiers, in all stages of growth.  Marjorie used to encounter whole columns of them, route marching—strange creatures, clothed in apparel which by no stretch of imagination could be described as uniform. But for all their fantastic blends of khaki and tweed, glengarry and billycock, Marjorie’s heart warmed to them.  They were so boisterous, so childlike, so absolutely certain of what was going to happen to the Boche when they got \"oot there.\"  At their head, as often as not, rode Major Bethune.  He and Marjorie had become acquainted under circumstances which will be recorded hereafter, and his punctilious salute never failed to thrill her.  He was an inspiring figure, and conspicuously solitary in his present _entourage_. He alone was left of all the cheery, careless brotherhood who had pursued the unexacting peace-time existence of a regular soldier at the depot of the Royal Covenanters—the prop and mainstay of every covert-shoot and tennis-party in the county.  They were all in France now. Many of them would never come back.  But Eric Bethune remained, to lick recruits into shape—with astonishing speed and efficiency, be it said—and send them out, draft after draft, to stiffen the ever-thinning ranks of the First and Second Battalions.  He hated being kept at home, and said so.  Marjorie sympathised with him deeply, for she knew exactly how he felt.  One day she told him so.  After that, Eric took considerable notice of her.  He had the simple vanity of a spoiled child, and reacted promptly to all those who took especially deferential notice of him.  The pair met here and there—at Buckholm, whither Marjorie was sometimes bidden with her mother to war relief committee meetings; at entertainments organised for the recruits; at crossroads, where Marjorie’s two-seater was frequently hung up by columns of marching men. On these occasions they exchanged greetings—even confidences.  Eric was more than twenty years Marjorie’s senior—a circumstance which, if anything, heightened their attraction for one another.  It gratified Eric hugely to find himself frankly admired by a young girl; while Marjorie, born hero-worshipper that she was, felt pleasantly thrilled at attracting the appreciative attention of a man so distinguished in his record and so much more important than herself.  Also, Eric’s great age—and to twenty, forty-three and infinity are very much the same thing—made him \"safe.\"  Fortunately for Eric’s self-esteem, he did not know this.  They had small chance to become really intimate.  There were few opportunities for social amenity in those days, and such as survived hardly covered Netherby at all.  In that bleak household itself opinion on the war was sharply divided. Albert Clegg came of a stock which had been educated to regard war as a luxury of the upper classes.  He believed that all wars were started by collusion between the \"military oligarchy\" and the armament"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],["title","Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#0)"],["body","NARRATIVE OF A PILGRIMAGE TO AL-MADINAH & MECCAH  BY  CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD F.

Al-Mutanabbi  [p.xv]  PREFACE TO THE MEMORIAL EDITION.  AFTER my beloved husband had passed away from amongst us, after the funeral had taken place, and I had settled in England, I began to think in what way I could render him the most honour. A material Monument to his memory has already been erected by his countrymen in the shape of a handsome contribution to the beautiful Mausoleum-tent in stone and marble to contain his remains; but I also hoped to erect a less material, but more imperishable, Monument to his name, by making this unique hero better known to his countrymen by his Works, which have hitherto not been sufficiently known, not extensively enough published, and issued perhaps at a prohibitive price. Viewing the long list of Works written by him between 1842 and 1890, many of which are still unpublished, I was almost disheartened by the magnitude of the work, until the Publishers, Messrs. Tylston and Edwards, fully appreciating the interest with which the British Public had followed my husband's adventurous career and fearless enterprise, arranged to produce this uniform Memorial Edition at their own expense.  [p.xvi]Mr. Leonard Smithers, a man of great literary talent and of indefatigable energy, who admired and collaborated with my husband in the traduction of Latin Classics for two years before he died, has also kindly volunteered to be my working assistant and to join with me in the editing.  My part is to give up all my copyrights, and to search out such papers, annotations, and latest notes and corrections, as will form the most complete work; also to write all the Prefaces, and to give every assistance in my power as Editress.  The Memorial Edition commences with the present \"Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah,\" which will be followed at intervals by others of my husband's works. Since this \"Memorial Edition\" was arranged, and the Prospectus issued, I have parted with the Copyright of my husband's famous translation of the \"Arabian Nights\" to the Publishers, and they are arranging to bring out that work at an early date, and as nearly as possible uniform in appearance with the Memorial Edition.  The ornamentations on the binding are, a figure of my husband in his Arab costume, his monogram in Arabic, and, on the back of the book, the tent which is his tomb.  Both the publishers and myself have to thank Mr. Smithers for the infinite trouble he has taken in collating the first, second, third and fourth editions of the ‘Pilgrimage' with Sir Richard's own original annotated copies. All the lengthy notes and appendices of the first edition have been retained, and these are supplemented by the notes and appendices in the later editions, as well as by the author's MS. notes. He has adopted Sir Richard's latest and  [p.xvii]most correct orthography of Arabic words, and has passed the sheets through the press. Following my husband's plan in \"The Thousand Nights and a Night,\" he has put the accents on Arabic words only the first time of their appearance, to show how they ought to be; thinking it unnecessary to preserve throughout, what is an eyesore to the reader and a distress to the printer. So it is with Arabic books,-the accents are only put for the early student; afterwards, they are left to the practical knowledge of the reader. All the original coloured illustrations of the first edition, and also the wood engravings of the later issues, are reproduced for the first time in one uniform edition. The map and plans are fac-similies of those in the latest (fourth) edition. In fact, everything has been done to make this book worthy of its author and of the public's appreciation.  For those who may not know the import of \"A Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah,\" in 1853, they will not take it amiss when I say that there are Holy Shrines of the Moslem world in the far-away Desert, where no white man, European, or Christian, could enter (save as a Moslem), or even approach, without certain death. They are more jealously guarded than the \"Holy Grail,\" and this Work narrates how this Pilgrimage was accomplished. My husband had lived as a Dervish in Sind, which greatly helped him; and he studied every separate thing until he was master of it, even apprenticing himself to a blacksmith to learn how to make horse-shoes and to shoe his own horses. It meant living with his life in his hand, amongst the strangest and wildest companions, adopting their unfamiliar manners, living for nine months in the hottest and most unhealthy climate, upon  [p.xviii]repulsive food; it meant complete and absolute isolation from everything that makes life tolerable, from all civilisation, from all his natural habits; the brain at high tension, but the mind never wavering from the role he had adopted; but he liked it, he was happy in it, he felt at home in it, and in this Book he tells you how he did it, and what he saw.  Sir Richard Burton died at the age of 70, on the 20th October, 1890. During the last 48 years of his life, he lived only for the benefit and for the welfare of England and of his countrymen, and of the Human Race at large. Let us reverently raise up this \"Monument,\" aere perennius, to his everlasting memory.  ISABEL BURTON. May 24, 1893.  [p.xix]PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.  AFTER a lapse of twenty-five years, a third edition of my Pilgrimage has been called for by the public, to whom I take this opportunity of returning thanks. Messrs. Mullan have chosen the very best opportunity. My two publications concerning the Khedival Expeditions to Midian (\"The Gold Mines of Midian,\" and \"The Land of Midian Revisited\"), are, as I have stated in the Preface, sequels and continuations of this Pilgrimage from which the adventures forming their subject may be said to date.  The text has been carefully revised, and the \"baggage of notes\" has been materially lightened.[FN#1] From the Appendix I have removed matter which, though useful to the student, is of scant general interest. The quaint and interesting \"Narrative and Voyages of Ludovicus Vertomannus, Gentleman of Rome,\" need no longer be read in extracts, when the whole has been printed by the Hakluyt Society. (The Travels of Ludovico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503 to 1508. Translated from the original Italian edition of 1510, with a Preface by John Winter Jones, Esq., F.S.A., and edited,  [p.xx]with notes and an Introduction, by George Percy Badger, late Government Chaplain in the Presidency of Bombay. London.) On the other hand, I have inserted after the Appendix, with the permission of the author, two highly interesting communications from Dr. Aloys Sprenger, the well-known Orientalist and Arabist, concerning the routes of the Great Caravans. My friend supports his suspicions that an error of direction has been made, and geographers will enjoy the benefit of his conscientious studies, topographical and linguistic.  The truculent attacks made upon pilgrims and Darwayshes call for a few words of notice. Even that learned and amiable philanthropist, the late Dr. John Wilson of Bombay (\"Lands of the Bible,\" vol. ii., p. 302) alludes, in the case of the Spaniard Badia, alias Ali Bey al-Abbasi, to the \"unjustifiable fanciful disguise of a Mohammedan Pilgrim.\" The author of the Ruddy Goose Theory (\"Voice of Israel from Mount Sinai\") and compiler of the \"Historical Geography of Arabia\" has dealt a foul blow to the memory of Burckhardt, the energetic and inoffensive Swiss traveller, whose name has ever been held in the highest repute. And now the \"Government Chaplain\" indites (Introduction, p. xxvii.) the following invidious remarks touching the travels of Ludovico di Varthema-the vir Deo carus, be it remarked, of the learned and laical Julius Caesar Scaliger:  \"This is not the place to discuss the morality of an act involving the deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a matter so sacred as that of Religion. Such a violation of conscience is not justifiable by the end which the renegade (!) may have in view, however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be; and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false, the conclusion is inevitable, that nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith, or a  [p.xxi]conscientious disbelief in them, can fairly relieve the Christian, who conforms to Islamism without a corresponding persuasion of its verity, of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy.\"  The reply to this tirade is simply, \"Judge not; especially when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging.\" Perhaps also the writer may ask himself, Is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility? The second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it. The author of the \"Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia\" (vol. i., pp. 258-59) thus expresses his opinions:-  \"Passing oneself off for a wandering Darweesh, as some European explorers have attempted to do in the East, is for more reasons than one a very bad plan. It is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the proceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds. To feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe, to perform with scrupulous exactitude, as of the highest and holiest import, practices which he inwardly"]]]
