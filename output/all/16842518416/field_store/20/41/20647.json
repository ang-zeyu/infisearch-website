Something tore a strip of bark from the trunk of a tree just above Lightfoot's back.  It was a bullet and it had just missed Lightfoot.  It added to his terror and this in turn added to his speed.  So Lightfoot ran and ran, and behind him the voices of the hounds continued to ring through the Green Forest.     CHAPTER XXI: How Lightfoot Got Rid Of The Hounds   Poor Lightfoot! It seemed to him that there were no such things as justice and fair play.  Had it been just one hunter at a time against whom he had to match his wits it would not have been so bad.  But there were many hunters with terrible guns looking for him, and in dodging one he was likely at any time to meet another.  This in itself seemed terribly unfair and unjust. But now, added to this was the greater unfairness of being trailed by hounds.  Do you wonder that Lightfoot thought of men as utterly heartless? You see, he could not know that those hounds had not been put on his trail, but had left home to hunt for their own pleasure. He could not know that it was against the law to hunt him with dogs. But though none of those hunters looking for him were guilty of having put the hounds on his trail, each one of them was willing and eager to take advantage of the fact that the hounds were on his trail. Already he had been shot at once and he knew that he would be shot at again if he should be driven where a hunter was hidden.  The ground was damp and scent always lies best on damp ground. This made it easy for the hounds to follow him with their wonderful noses. Lightfoot tried every trick he could think of to make those hounds lose the scent.  \"If only I could make them lose it long enough for me to get a little rest, it would help,\" panted Lightfoot, as he paused for just an instant to listen to the baying of the hounds.  But he couldn't.  They allowed him no rest. He was becoming very, very tired.  He could no longer bound lightly over fallen logs or brush, as he had done at first.  His lungs ached as he panted for breath.  He realized that even though he should escape the hunters he would meet an even more terrible death unless he could get rid of those hounds.  There would come a time when he would have to stop. Then those hounds would catch up with him and tear him to pieces.  It was then that he remembered the Big River.  He turned towards it. It was his only chance and he knew it.  Straight through the Green Forest, out across the Green Meadows to the bank of the Big River, Lightfoot ran.  For just a second he paused to look behind. The hounds were almost at his heels. Lightfoot hesitated no longer but plunged into the Big River and began to swim. On the banks the hounds stopped and bayed their disappointment, for they did not dare follow Lightfoot out into the Big River.     CHAPTER XXII: Lightfoot's Long Swim   The Big River was very wide.  It would have been a long swim for Lightfoot had he been fresh and at his best.  Strange as it may seem, Lightfoot is a splendid swimmer, despite his small, delicate feet.  He enjoys swimming.  But now Lightfoot was terribly tired from his long run ahead of the hounds.  For a time he swam rapidly, but those weary muscles grew still more weary, and by the time he reached the middle of the Big River it seemed to him that he was not getting ahead at all. At first he had tried to swim towards a clump of trees he could see on the opposite bank above the point where he had entered the water, but to do this he had to swim against the current and he soon found that he hadn't the strength to do this. Then he turned and headed for a point down the Big River. This made the swimming easier, for the current helped him instead of hindering him.  Even then he could feel his strength leaving him.  Had he escaped those hounds and the terrible hunters only to be drowned in the Big River?  This new fear gave him more strength for a little while. But it did not last long.  He was three fourths of the way across the Big River but still that other shore seemed a long distance away.  Little by little hope died in the heart of Lightfoot the Deer.  He would keep on just as long as he could and then,--well, it was better to drown than to be torn to pieces by dogs.  Just as Lightfoot felt that he could not take another stroke and that the end was at hand, one foot touched something.  Then, all four feet touched.  A second later he had found solid footing and was standing with the water only up to his knees.  He had found a little sand bar out in the Big River.  With a little gasp of returning hope, Lightfoot waded along until the water began to grow deeper again.  He had hoped that he would be able to wade ashore, but he saw now that he would have to swim again.  So for a long time he remained right where he was.  He was so tired that he trembled all over, and he was as frightened as he was tired.  He knew that standing out there in the water he could be seen for a long distance, and that made him nervous and fearful.  Supposing a hunter on the shore he was trying to reach should see him.  Then he would have no chance at all, for the hunter would simply wait for him and shoot him as he came out of the water.  But rest he must, and so he stood for a long time on the little sand bar in the Big River.  And little by little he felt his strength returning.     CHAPTER XXIII: Lightfoot Finds A Friend   As Lightfoot rested, trying to recover his breath, out there on the little sand bar in the Big River, his great, soft, beautiful eyes watched first one bank and then the other.  On the bank he had left, he could see two black-and-white specks moving about, and across the water came the barking of dogs.  Those two specks were the hounds who had driven him into the Big River.  They were barking now, instead of baying.  Presently a brown form joined the black-and-white specks.  It was a hunter drawn there by the barking of the dogs.  He was too far away to be dangerous, but the mere sight of him filled Lightfoot with terror again.  He watched the hunter walk along the bank and disappear in the bushes.  Presently out of the bushes came a boat, and in it was the hunter.  He headed straight towards Lightfoot, and then Lightfoot knew that his brief rest was at an end.  He must once more swim or be shot by the hunter in the boat.  So Lightfoot again struck out for the shore.  His rest had given him new strength, but still he was very, very tired and swimming was hard work.  Slowly, oh so slowly, he drew nearer to the bank.  What new dangers might be waiting there, he did not know.  He had never been on that side of the Big River.  He knew nothing of the country on that side.  But the uncertainty was better than the certainty behind him.  He could hear the sound of the oars as the hunter in the boat did his best to get to him before he should reach the shore.  On Lightfoot struggled. At last he felt bottom beneath his feet.  He staggered up through some bushes along the bank and then for an instant it seemed to him his heart stopped beating.  Right in front of him stood a man.  He had come out into the back yard of the home of that man.  It is doubtful which was the more surprised, Lightfoot or the man.  Right then and there Lightfoot gave up in despair.  He couldn't run.  It was all he could do to walk.  The long chase by the hounds on the other side of the Big River and the long swim across the Big River had taken all his strength.  Not a spark of hope remained to Lightfoot.  He simply stood still and trembled, partly with fear and partly with weariness.  Then a surprising thing happened.  The man spoke softly.  He advanced, not threateningly but slowly, and in a friendly way.  He walked around back of Lightfoot and then straight towards him.  Lightfoot walked on a few steps, and the man followed, still talking softly. Little by little he urged Lightfoot on, driving him towards an open shed in which was a pile of hay. Without understanding just how, Lightfoot knew that he had found a friend.  So he entered the open shed and with a long sigh lay down in the soft hay.     CHAPTER XXIV: The Hunter Is Disappointed   How he knew he was safe, Lightfoot the Deer Couldn't have told you. He just knew it, that was all.  He couldn't understand a word said by the man in whose yard he found himself when he climbed the bank after his long swim across the Big River.  But he didn't have to understand words to know that he had found a friend. So he allowed the man to drive him gently over to an open shed where there was a pile of soft hay and there he lay down, so tired that it seemed to him he couldn't move another step.  It was only a few minutes later that the hunter who had followed Lightfoot across the River reached the bank and scrambled out of his boat.  Lightfoot's friend was waiting just at the top of the bank.  Of course the hunter saw him at once.  \"Hello, Friend!\" cried the hunter.  \"Did you see a Deer pass this way a few minutes ago?  He swam across the river, and if I know anything about it he's too tired to travel far now.  I've been hunting that fellow for several days, and if I have any luck at all I ought to get him this time.\"  \"I'm afraid you won't have any luck at all,\" said Lightfoot's friend.  \"You see, I don't allow any hunting on my land.\"  The hunter looked surprised, and then his surprise gave way to anger.  \"You mean,\" said he, \"that you intend to get that Deer yourself.\"  Lightfoot's friend shook his head.  \"No,\" said he, \"I don't mean anything of the kind.  I mean that that Deer is not to be killed if I can prevent it, and while it is on my land, I think I can. The best thing for you to do, my friend, is to get into your boat and row back where you came from.  Are those your hounds barking over there?\"  \"No,\" replied the hunter promptly.  \"I know the law just as well as you do, and it is against the law to hunt Deer with dogs. I don't even know"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4670"],["title","Lightfoot the Deer (#7)"],["body","owns those two hounds over there.\"  \"That may be true,\" replied Lightfoot's friend.  \"I don't doubt it is true.  But you are willing to take advantage of the fact that the dogs of some one else have broken the law.  You knew that those dogs had driven that Deer into the Big River and you promptly took advantage of the fact to try to reach that Deer before he could get across.  You are not hunting for the pleasure of hunting but just to kill.  You don't know the meaning of justice or fairness.  Now get off my land.  Get back into your boat and off my land as quick as you can.  That Deer is not very far from here and so tired that he cannot move.  Just as long as he will stay here, he will be safe, and I hope he will stay until this miserable hunting season is ended. Now go.\"  Muttering angrily, the hunter got back into his boat and pushed off, but he didn't row back across the river.     CHAPTER XXV: The Hunter Lies In Wait   If ever there was an angry hunter, it was the one who had followed Lightfoot the Deer across the Big River.  When he was ordered to get off the land where Lightfoot had climbed out, he got back into his boat, but he didn't row back to the other side. Instead, he rowed down the river, finally landing on the same side but on land which Lightfoot's friend did not own.  \"When that Deer has become rested he'll become uneasy,\" thought the hunter.  \"He won't stay on that man's land. He'll start for the nearest woods.  I'll go up there and wait for him.  I'll get that Deer if only to spite that fellow back there who drove me off. Had it not been for him, I'd have that Deer right now. He was too tired to have gone far.  He's got the handsomest pair of antlers I've seen for years.  I can sell that head of his for a good price.\"  So the hunter tied his boat to a tree and once more climbed out.  He climbed up the bank and studied the land.  Across a wide meadow he could see a brushy old pasture and back of that some thick woods.  He grinned.  \"That's where that Deer will head for,\" he decided.  \"There isn't any other place for him to go.  All I've got to do is be patient and wait.\"  So the hunter took his terrible gun and tramped across the meadow to the brush-grown pasture.  There he hid among the bushes where he could peep out and watch the land of Lightfoot's friend. He was still angry because he had been prevented from shooting Lightfoot. At the same time he chuckled, because he thought himself very smart.  Lightfoot couldn't possibly reach the shelter of the woods without giving him a shot, and he hadn't the least doubt that Lightfoot would start for the woods just as soon as he felt able to travel.  So he made himself comfortable and prepared to wait the rest of the day, if necessary.  Now Lightfoot's friend who had driven the hunter off had seen him row down the river and he had guessed just what was in that hunter's mind.  \"We'll fool him,\" said he, chuckling to himself, as he walked back towards the shed where poor Lightfoot was resting.  He did not go too near Lightfoot, for he did not want to alarm him. He just kept within sight of Lightfoot, paying no attention to him but going about his work.  You see, this man loved and understood the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, and he knew that there was no surer way of winning Lightfoot's confidence and trust than by appearing to take no notice of him.  Lightfoot, watching him, understood. He knew that this man was a friend and would do him no harm.  Little by little, the wonderful, blessed feeling of safety crept over Lightfoot. No hunter could harm him here.     CHAPTER XXVI: Lightfoot Does The Wise Thing   All the rest of that day the hunter with the terrible gun lay hidden in the bushes of the pasture where he could watch for Lightfoot the Deer to leave the place of safety he had found. It required a lot of patience on the part of the hunter, but the hunter had plenty of patience.  It sometimes seems as if hunters have more patience than any other people.  But this hunter waited in vain.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sank down in the west to his bed behind the Purple Hills.  The Black Shadows crept out and grew blacker.  One by one the stars began to twinkle.  Still the hunter waited, and still there was no sign of Lightfoot.  At last it became so dark that it was useless for the hunter to remain longer.  Disappointed and once more becoming angry, he tramped back to the Big River, climbed into his boat and rowed across to the other side.  Then he tramped home and his thoughts were very bitter.  He knew that he could have shot Lightfoot had it not been for the man who had protected the Deer.  He even began to suspect that this man had himself killed Lightfoot, for he had been sure that as soon as he had become rested Lightfoot would start for the woods, and Lightfoot had done nothing of the kind.  In fact, the hunter had not had so much as another glimpse of Lightfoot.  The reason that the hunter had been so disappointed was that Lightfoot was smart.  He was smart enough to understand that the man who was saving him from the hunter had done it because he was a true friend.  All the afternoon Lightfoot had rested on a bed of soft hay in an open shed and had watched this man going about his work and taking the utmost care to do nothing to frighten Lightfoot.  \"He not only will let no one else harm me, but he himself will not harm me,\" thought Lightfoot.  \"As long as he is near, I am safe. I'll stay right around here until the hunting season is over, then I'll swim back across the Big River to my home in the dear Green Forest.\"  So all afternoon Lightfoot rested and did not so much as put his nose outside that open shed.  That is why the hunter got no glimpse of him.  When it became dark, so dark that he knew there was no longer danger, Lightfoot got up and stepped out under the stars. He was feeling quite himself again. His splendid strength had returned. He bounded lightly across the meadow and up into the brushy pasture where the hunter had been hidden.  There and in the woods back of the pasture he browsed, but at the first hint of the coming of another day, Lightfoot turned back, and when his friend, the farmer, came out early in the morning to milk the cows, there was Lightfoot back in the open shed. The farmer smiled. \"You are as wise as you are handsome, old fellow,\" said he.     CHAPTER XXVII: Sammy Jay Worries   It isn't often Sammy Jay worries about anybody but himself. Truth to tell, he doesn't worry about himself very often.  You see, Sammy is smart, and he knows he is smart.  Under that pointed cap of his are some of the cleverest wits in all the Green Forest. Sammy seldom worries about himself because he feels quite able to take care of himself.  But Sammy Jay was worrying now.  He was worrying about Lightfoot the Deer.  Yes, Sir, Sammy Jay was worrying about Lightfoot the Deer.  For two days he had been unable to find Lightfoot or any trace of Lightfoot.  But he did find plenty of hunters with terrible guns.  It seemed to him that they were everywhere in the Green Forest.  Sammy began to suspect that one of them must have succeeded in killing Lightfoot the Deer.  Sammy knew all of Lightfoot's hiding-places.  He visited every one of them.  Lightfoot wasn't to be found, and no one whom Sammy met had seen Lightfoot for two days.  Sammy felt badly.  You see, he was very fond of Lightfoot. You remember it was Sammy who warned Lightfoot of the coming of the hunter on the morning when the dreadful hunting season began. Ever since the hunting season had opened, Sammy had done his best to make trouble for the hunters.  Whenever he had found one of them he had screamed at the top of his voice to warn every one within hearing just where that hunter was.  Once a hunter had lost his temper and shot at Sammy, but Sammy had suspected that something of the kind might happen, and he had taken care to keep just out of reach.  Sammy had known all about the chasing of Lightfoot by the hounds.  Everybody in the Green Forest had known about it.  You see, everybody had heard the voices of those hounds.  Once, Lightfoot had passed right under the tree in which Sammy was sitting, and a few moments later the two hounds had passed with their noses to the ground as they followed Lightfoot's trail. That was the last Sammy had seen of Lightfoot. He had been able to save Lightfoot from the hunters, but he couldn't save him from the hounds.  The more Sammy thought things over, the more he worried.  \"I am afraid those hounds drove him out where a hunter could get a shot and kill him, or else that they tired him out and killed him themselves,\" thought Sammy.  \"If he were alive, somebody certainly would have seen him and nobody has, since the day those hounds chased him.  I declare, I have quite lost my appetite worrying about him.  If Lightfoot is dead, and I am almost sure he is, the Green Forest will never seem the same.\"     CHAPTER XXVIII: The Hunting Season Ends   The very worst things come to an end at last.  No matter how bad a thing is, it cannot last forever.  So it was with the hunting season for Lightfoot the Deer.  There came a day when the law protected all Deer,--a day when the hunters could no longer go searching for Lightfoot.  Usually there was great rejoicing among the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows when the hunting season ended and they knew that Lightfoot would be in no more danger until the next hunting season.  But this year there was no rejoicing.  You see, no one could find Lightfoot.  The last seen of him was when he was running for his life with two hounds baying on his trail and the Green Forest filled with hunters watching for a chance to shoot him.  Sammy Jay had hunted everywhere through the Green Forest.  Blacky the Crow, whose eyes are quite as sharp as those of Sammy Jay, had joined in the search.  They had found no trace of Lightfoot. Paddy the Beaver said that for three days"]]]
