Billy Mink, who travels up and down the Laughing Brook, had looked for Lightfoot's footprints in the soft earth along the banks and had found only old ones.  Jumper the Hare had visited Lightfoot's favorite eating places at night, but Lightfoot had not been in any of them.  \"I tell you what it is,\" said Sammy Jay to Bobby Coon, \"something has happened to Lightfoot.  Either those hounds caught him and killed him, or he was shot by one of those hunters.  The Green Forest will never be the same without him.  I don't think I shall want to come over here very much.  There isn't one of all the other people who live in the Green Forest who would be missed as Lightfoot will be.\"  Bobby Coon nodded.  \"That's true, Sammy,\" said he.  \"Without Lightfoot, the Green Forest will never be the same.  He never harmed anybody.  Why those hunters should have been so anxious to kill one so beautiful is something I can't understand.  For that matter, I don't understand why they want to kill any of us. If they really needed us for food, it would be a different matter, but they don't.  Have you been up in the Old Pasture and asked Old Man Coyote if he has seen anything of Lightfoot?\"  Sammy nodded.  \"I've been up there twice,\" said he.  \"Old Man Coyote has been lying very low during the days, but nights he has done a lot of traveling.  You know Old Man Coyote has a mighty good nose, but not once since the day those hounds chased Lightfoot has he found so much as a tiny whiff of Lightfoot's scent.  I thought he might have found the place where Lightfoot was killed, but he hasn't, although he has looked for it.  Well, the hunting season for Lightfoot is over, but I am afraid it has ended too late.\"     CHAPTER XXIX: Mr. And Mrs. Quack Are Startled   It was the evening of the day after the closing of the hunting season for Lightfoot the Deer.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept out across the Big River.  Mr. and Mrs. Quack were getting their evening meal among the brown stalks of the wild rice along the edge of the Big River.  They took turns in searching for the rice grains in the mud.  While Mrs. Quack tipped up and seemed to stand on her head as she searched in the mud for rice, Mr. Quack kept watch for possible danger.  Then Mrs. Quack took her turn at keeping watch, while Mr. Quack stood on his head and hunted for rice.  It was wonderfully quiet and peaceful.  There was not even a ripple on the Big River.  It was so quiet that they could hear the barking of a dog at a farmhouse a mile away.  They were far enough out from the bank to have nothing to fear from Reddy Fox or Old Man Coyote.  So they had nothing to fear from any one save Hooty the Owl.  It was for Hooty that they took turns in watching. It was just the hour when Hooty likes best to hunt.  By and by they heard Booty's hunting call.  It was far away in the Green Forest, Then Mr. and Mrs. Quack felt easier, and they talked in low, contented voices.  They felt that for a while at least there was nothing to fear.  Suddenly a little splash out in the Big River caught Mr. Quack's quick ear.  As Mrs. Quack brought her head up out of the water, Mr. Quack warned her to keep quiet.  Noiselessly they swam among the brown stalks until they could see out across the Big River. There was another little splash out there in the middle.  It wasn't the splash made by a fish; it was a splash made by something much bigger than any fish.  Presently they made out a silver line moving towards them from the Black Shadows.  They knew exactly what it meant.  It meant that some one was out there in the Big River moving towards them.  Could it be a boat containing a hunter?  With their necks stretched high, Mr. and Mrs. Quack watched. They were ready to take to their strong wings the instant they discovered danger.  But they did not want to fly until they were sure that it WAS danger approaching.  They were startled, very much startled.  Presently they made out what looked like the branch of a tree moving over the water towards them.  That was queer, very queer.  Mr. Quack said so.  Mrs. Quack said so.  Both were growing more and more suspicious.  They couldn't understand it at all, and it is always best to be suspicious of things you cannot understand.  Mr. and Mrs. Quack half lifted their wings to fly.     CHAPTER XXX: The Mystery Is Solved   It was very mysterious.  Yes, Sir, it was very mysterious. Mr. Quack thought so.  Mrs. Quack thought so.  There, out in the Big River, in the midst of the Black Shadows, was something which looked like the branch of a tree.  But instead of moving down the river, as the branch of a tree would if it were floating, this was coming straight across the river as if it were swimming.  But how could the branch of a tree swim?  That was too much for Mr. Quack.  It was too much for Mrs. Quack.  So they sat perfectly still among the brown stalks of the wild rice along the edge of the Big River, and not for a second did they take their eyes from that strange thing moving towards them.  They were ready to spring into the air and trust to their swift wings the instant they should detect danger.  But they did not want to fly unless they had to.  Besides, they were curious.  They were very curious indeed.  They wanted to find out what that mysterious thing moving through the water towards them was.  So Mr. and Mrs. Quack watched that thing that looked like a swimming branch draw nearer and nearer, and the nearer it drew the more they were puzzled, and the more curious they felt.  If it had been the pond of Paddy the Beaver instead of the Big River, they would have thought it was Paddy swimming with a branch for his winter food pile.  But Paddy the Beaver was way back in his own pond, deep in the Green Forest, and they knew it.  So this thing became more and more of a mystery.  The nearer it came, the more nervous and anxious they grew, and at the same time the greater became their curiosity.  At last Mr. Quack felt that not even to gratify his curiosity would it be safe to wait longer.  He prepared to spring into the air, knowing that Mrs. Quack would follow him.  It was just then that a funny little sound reached him.  It was half snort, half cough, as if some one had sniffed some water up his nose.  There was something familiar about that sound.  Mr. Quack decided to wait a few minutes longer.  \"I'll wait,\" thought Mr. Quack, \"until that thing, whatever it is, comes out of those Black Shadows into the moonlight. Somehow I have a feeling that we are in no danger.\"  So Mr. and Mrs. Quack waited and watched.  In a few minutes the thing that looked like the branch of a tree came out of the Black Shadows into the moonlight, and then the mystery was solved. It was a mystery no longer.  They saw that they had mistaken the antlers of Lightfoot the Deer for the branch of a tree.  Lightfoot was swimming across the Big River on his way back to his home in the Green Forest.  At once Mr. and Mrs. Quack swam out to meet him and to tell him how glad they were that he was alive and safe.     CHAPTER XXXI: A Surprising Discovery   Probably there was no happier Thanksgiving in all the Great World than the Thanksgiving of Lightfoot the Deer, when the dreadful hunting season ended and he was once more back in his beloved Green Forest with nothing to fear.  All his neighbors called on him to tell him how glad they were that he had escaped and how the Green Forest would not have been the same if he had not returned.  So Lightfoot roamed about without fear and was happy.  It seemed to him that he could not be happier.  There was plenty to eat and that blessed feeling of nothing to fear. What more could any one ask?  He began to grow sleek and fat and handsomer than ever.  The days were growing colder and the frosty air made him feel good.  Just at dusk one evening he went down to his favorite drinking place at the Laughing Brook.  As he put down his head to drink he saw something which so surprised him that he quite forgot he was thirsty.  What do you think it was he saw?  It was a footprint in the soft mud.  Yes, Sir, it was a footprint.  For a long time Lightfoot stood staring at that footprint.  In his great, soft eyes was a look of wonder and surprise.  You see, that footprint was exactly like one of his own, only smaller. To Lightfoot it was a very wonderful footprint. He was quite sure that never had he seen such a dainty footprint.  He forgot to drink. Instead, he began to search for other footprints, and presently he found them.  Each was as dainty as that first one.  Who could have made them?  That is what Lightfoot wanted to know and what he meant to find out.  It was clear to him that there was a stranger in the Green Forest, and somehow he didn't resent it in the least.  In fact, he was glad.  He couldn't have told why, but it was true.  Lightfoot put his nose to the footprints and sniffed of them. Even had he not known by looking at those prints that they had been made by a stranger, his nose would have told him this. A great longing to find the maker of those footprints took possession of him.  He lifted his handsome head and listened for some slight sound which might show that the stranger was near. With his delicate nostrils he tested the wandering little Night Breezes for a stray whiff of scent to tell him which way to go. But there was no sound and the wandering little Night Breezes told him nothing.  Lightfoot followed the dainty footprints up the bank. There they disappeared, for the ground was hard.  Lightfoot paused, undecided which way to go.     CHAPTER XXXII: Lightfoot Sees The Stranger   Lightfoot the Deer was unhappy.  It was a strange unhappiness, an unhappiness such as he had never known before.  You see, he had discovered that there was a stranger in the Green Forest, a stranger of his own kind, another Deer.  He knew it by dainty footprints in the mud along"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],["title","The Story of the Pony Express (#0)"],["body","Story of the Pony Express   An account of the most remarkable mail service ever in existence, and its place in history.    By  Glenn D. Bradley   Author of Winning the Southwest    To My Parents     Preface   This little volume has but one purpose--to give an authentic, useful, and readable account of the Pony Express. This wonderful enterprise played an important part in history, and demonstrated what American spirit can accomplish. It showed that the \"heroes of sixty-one\" were not all south of Mason and Dixon's line fighting each other. And, strange to say, little of a formal nature has been written concerning it.  I have sought to bring to light and make accessible to all readers the more important facts of the Pony Express--its inception, organization and development, its importance to history, its historical background, and some of the anecdotes incidental to its operation.  The subject leads one into a wide range of fascinating material, all interesting though much of it is irrelevant. In itself this material is fragmentary and incoherent. It would be quite easy to fill many pages with western adventure having no special bearing upon the central topic. While I have diverged occasionally from the thread of the narrative, my purpose has been merely to give where possible more background to the story, that the account as a whole might be more understandable in its relation to the general facts of history.  Special acknowledgment is due Frank A. Root of Topeka, Kansas, joint author with William E. Connelley of The Overland Stage To California, an excellent compendium of data on many phases of the subject. In preparing this work, various Senate Documents have been of great value. Some interesting material is found in Inman and Cody's Salt Lake Trail.  The files of the Century Magazine, old newspaper files, Bancroft's colossal history of the West and the works of Samuel L. Clemens have also been of value in compiling the present book.  G.D.B.

It was a system by means of which messages were carried swiftly on horseback across the plains and deserts, and over the mountains of the far West. It brought the Atlantic coast and the Pacific slope ten days nearer to each other.  It had a brief existence of only sixteen months and was supplanted by the transcontinental telegraph. Yet it was of the greatest importance in binding the East and West together at a time when overland travel was slow and cumbersome, and when a great national crisis made the rapid communication of news between these sections an imperative necessity.  The Pony Express marked the highest development in overland travel prior to the coming of the Pacific railroad, which it preceded nine years. It, in fact, proved the feasibility of a transcontinental road and demonstrated that such a line could be built and operated continuously the year around--a feat that had always been regarded as impossible.  The operation of the Pony Express was a supreme achievement of physical endurance on the part of man and his ever faithful companion, the horse. The history of this organization should be a lasting monument to the physical sacrifice of man and beast in an effort to accomplish something worth while. Its history should be an enduring tribute to American courage and American organizing genius.  The fall of Fort Sumter in April, 1861, did not produce the Civil War crisis. For many months, the gigantic struggle then imminent, had been painfully discernible to far-seeing men. In 1858, Lincoln had forewarned the country in his \"House Divided\" speech. As early as the beginning of the year 1860 the Union had been plainly in jeopardy. Early in February of that momentous year, Jefferson Davis, on behalf of the South, had introduced his famous resolutions in the Senate of the United States. This document was the ultimatum of the dissatisfied slave-holding commonwealths. It demanded that Congress should protect slavery throughout the domain of the United States. The territories, it declared, were the common property of the states of the Union and hence open to the citizens of all states with all their personal possessions. The Northern states, furthermore, were no longer to interfere with the working of the Fugitive Slave Act. They must repeal their Personal Liberty laws and respect the Dred Scott Decision of the Federal Supreme Court. Neither in their own legislatures nor in Congress should they trespass upon the right of the South to regulate slavery as it best saw fit.  These resolutions, demanding in effect that slavery be thus safeguarded--almost to the extent of introducing it into the free states--really foreshadowed the Democratic platform of 1860 which led to the great split in that party, the victory of the Republicans under Lincoln, the subsequent secession of the more radical southern states, and finally the Civil War, for it was inevitable that the North, when once aroused, would bitterly resent such pro-slavery demands.  And this great crisis was only the bursting into flame of many smaller fires that had long been smoldering. For generations the two sections had been drifting apart. Since the middle of the seventeenth century, Mason and Dixon's line had been a line of real division separating two inherently distinct portions of the country.  By 1860, then, war was inevitable. Naturally, the conflict would at once present intricate military problems, and among them the retention of the Pacific Coast was of the deepest concern to the Union. Situated at a distance of nearly two thousand miles from the Missouri river which was then the nation's western frontier, this intervening space comprised trackless plains, almost impenetrable ranges of snow-capped mountains, and parched alkali deserts. And besides these barriers of nature which lay between the West coast and the settled eastern half of the country, there were many fierce tribes of savages who were usually on the alert to oppose the movements of the white race through their dominions.  California, even then, was the jewel of the Pacific. Having a considerable population, great natural wealth, and unsurpassed climate and fertility, she was jealously desired by both the North and the South.  To the South, the acquisition of California meant enhanced prestige--involving, as it would, the occupation of a large area whose soils and climate might encourage the perpetuation of slavery; it meant a rich possession which would afford her a strategic base for waging war against her northern foe; it meant a romantic field in which opportunity might be given to organize an allied republic of the Pacific, a power which would, perchance, forcibly absorb the entire Southwest and a large section of Northern Mexico. By thus creating counter forces the South would effectively block the Federal Government on the western half of the continent.  The North also desired the prestige that would come from holding California as well as the material strength inherent in the state's valuable resources. Moreover to hold this region would give the North a base of operations to check her opponent in any campaign of aggression in the far West, should the South presume such an attempt. And the possession of California would also offer to the North the very best means of protecting the Western frontier, one of the Union's most vulnerable points of attack.  It was with such vital conditions that the Pony Express was identified; it was in retaining California for the Union, and in helping incidentally to preserve the Union, that the Express became an important factor in American history.  Not to mention the romance, the unsurpassed courage, the unflinching endurance, and the wonderful exploits which the routine operations of the Pony Express involved, its identity with problems of nation-wide and world-wide importance make its story seem worth telling. And with its romantic existence and its place in history the succeeding pages of this book will briefly deal.     Chapter II  Inception and Organization of the Pony Express   Following the discovery of gold in California in January 1848, that region sprang into immediate prominence. From all parts of the country and the remote corners of the earth came the famous Forty-niners. Amid the chaos of a great mining camp the Anglo-Saxon love of law and order soon asserted itself. Civil and religious institutions quickly arose, and, in the summer of 1850, a little more than a year after the big rush had started, California entered the Union as a free state.  The boom went on and the census of 1860 revealed a population of 380,000 in the new commonwealth. And when to these figures were added those of Oregon and Washington Territory, an aggregate of 444,000 citizens of the United States were found to be living on the Pacific Slope. Crossing the Sierras eastward and into the Great Basin, 47,000 more were located in the Territories of Nevada and Utah,--thus making a grand total of nearly a half million people beyond the Rocky Mountains in 1860. And these figures did not include Indians nor Chinese.  Without reference to any military phase of the problem, this detached population obviously demanded and deserved adequate mail and transportation facilities.
