Here he spent a year in Fort Garry, which was then \"the farthest West.\"  After a short time in the Royal Canadian Artillery he went West again, became a Major in the Alberta Field Force during the rebellion of 1885, having raised his own corps of \"Steele's Scouts.\"  He was through all the fighting of that summer, and finally broke up Big Bear's band at Loon Lake, a place in the Great Northern Forest where no white man had ever before set foot.  In 1898, as soon as the Klondyke gold rush began, he was dispatched at once to secure the frontier, erect customs posts, and prevent American miners establishing claims on the wrong side of a vast and ill-defined frontier.  In 1899 he was promoted Lieut.-Colonel, and became the military representative of the Government in the Yukon.  The South African War brought him immediately into the field.  Within the space of five days he recruited \"Strathcona's Horse\" from the Western provinces; within a month he had them ready to move from Ottawa--truly a miraculous performance.  In South Africa he saw a good deal of fighting in Natal and the Lydenberg district east of Pretoria, notably at Belfast.  On August 26th, 1900, he was mentioned in despatches, obtained the Queen's medal with four clasps, and finally took command of a division of the new South African Constabulary.  At this stage he was for six months under the direct orders of Lord Kitchener, with whom he became intimately acquainted.  In 1906, after a period of mixed civil and military administration in South Africa, he returned to the Dominion to take over the command of the Western Canada military district, a post he occupied until December, 1914.  Seven thousand six hundred men went from his command in the West to the First Canadian Contingent, and before he left to take command of the 2nd Division no fewer than 24,000 men in his district had joined the Colours.  [3] The Special Message from the King to the 2nd Canadian Division was published after the inspection:--  \"Officers, Non-commissioned Officers and Men of the 2nd Canadian Division,--Six months ago I inspected the 1st Canadian Division before their departure for the Front.  The heroism they have since shown on the field of battle has won for them undying tame.  You are now leaving to join them, and I am glad to have the opportunity of seeing you to-day, for it has convinced me that the same spirit which animated them inspires you also.  The past weeks at Shorncliffe have been for you a period of severe and rigorous training; and your appearance at this inspection testifies to the thoroughness and devotion to duty with which your work has been performed.  You are going to meet hardships and dangers, but the steadiness and discipline which have marked your bearing on parade to-day will carry you through all difficulties. History will never forget your loyalty and the readiness with which you rallied to the aid of your Mother Country in the hour of danger.  My thoughts will always be with you.  May God bless you and bring you victory!\"  [4] The 6th Brigade was formed by reorganising the 8th Howitzer Brigade from the Reserve Brigade at Shorncliffe.

[Sidenote: _Sept., 1915._]  With the junction between the two divisions the work of the Canadian troops in Flanders enters on a new and broader phase.  The meeting took place in time midway between the tempest which raged on the plains of Ypres in May of 1915 and that scarcely less violent iron-storm which, in the same month of 1916, burst in the fields of St. Eloi.  An interval of calm, or such calm as modern war knows, was permitted for that reunion.  It is well for the soldier that there should be such intervals, for the strain of modern action, were it never relaxed, would destroy the mind and nerve of man as surely as the continuance of its shell fire must destroy the body.  But though modern armies cannot always be locked in desperate conflict, the reader may not find the ensuing chapters altogether dull.  He will be able to trace the steps by which the original 1st Division added unto itself first a second and then a third, and developed into an army corps.  He can watch the multiplication of the Staffs, the promotion of Brigadiers to command divisions, of Colonels to brigades, and of Majors and Captains to regiments; the process of the division of labour as the specialists develop in bombing, mining, or machine-gunning; the foundations of schools of instruction behind the line; the methodical study of the arts of patrolling and raiding.  He can survey, in fact, the full range of those methods by which large bodies of men carrying rifles gradually develop into a self-sufficient army far greater in numbers than the British troops that the Duke of Wellington commanded, not so far away, on the field of Waterloo.  As a stream draws into it confluent after confluent until it attains the dignity of a river, so the original Canadian Expeditionary Force, by the flow of men across the Atlantic, is becoming an army; and it is the history of this process that the next few chapters must relate.  In artillery alone is the development a slow one, and here the 2nd and 3rd Divisions were for long dependent on the assistance of the British gunners.  The scene is laid in a sector to the south of Ypres and to the north of Armenti√®res.  Its more southerly position in the line is marked by the greater number of spinneys, small eminences, and commanding heights, such as that of Kemmel, from which the enemy's lines can be overlooked. But portions of it are a dead level, and it is very far from the well-covered hills of the real southern line.  The main features are still those of Flanders--the slightly rolling flat where the transparent richness of the crops which spring from the sand and the clay seems no deeper than the paint of a fresco on the wall, and the scraggy trees and ragged woods mock one with a delusive memory of forest cool and shade.  As the army grows the winter draws on, and the fine, hot autumn days and brilliant nights with the moon high in the heavens behind the trenches turn to the rains of November and the mists and frosts of Christmas.  The ground grows wet underfoot and the air is clammy and cold.  Such is the winter season of Northern Europe, when most of the campaigners of history allowed their troops to hibernate in warm and comfortable billets.  The 1st Division had spent the later summer on a sector the right of which rests on the northern edge of Ploegsteert.  As the 2nd Division came by degrees into the fighting line the Canadian sector was extended northwards until the left of the Corps finally rested on a spot a little to the south of St. Eloi.  The moves which resulted in the final disposition were not all made in a day, but it would be tedious to do more than note in passing the various shifts the new corps made with the II British Corps to the south of them and the V British Corps to the north.  Roughly speaking, the northern line ending by St. Eloi was taken over by the 2nd Division while the 1st Division remained in the Ploegsteert area to the south.  The dividing point was a little to the north of Wulverghem, facing the German trenches half-way between Messines and Wytschaete.  For the sake of clearness one might call it the sector of Bailleul.  The distinguishing feature of the line is length rather than depth--the precise converse of the subsequent St. Eloi position.  The line from that place to Ploegsteert is not excessive for a corps of three divisions, but it is distinctly so for one with only two.  In fact, on March 1st, when the whole three divisions were assembled, the frontage was occupied by six out of the nine brigades, and this six brigade frontage was throughout the normal one.  But the 3rd Division was not in full existence till the middle of January, 1916, and in the meantime the reliefs could only be effected by such elements of corps troops as happened from time to time to be in readiness.  Thus on October 3rd, when an additional two thousand yards were taken over, and the 2nd Division occupied our final position to the north, the only corps troops available for reliefs were Brigadier-General Seely's force, consisting of three regiments of the Cavalry Brigade and the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifle Brigade.  The 42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada) and the 49th Battalion (Edmonton Regiment) did not arrive till the middle of that month, the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifle Brigade till towards the end of it, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and the Royal Canadian Regiment till November, and the various units which finally formed the 3rd Division were not completed till January.  This necessarily entailed a somewhat extended sojourn in the front line area by the various brigades of the first two divisions.  The task, therefore, of interchanging the different units was one that required careful working out on the part of the Corps Staff."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46115"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume II (#8)"],["body","ordinary divisional front is held by two brigades, with a third at rest well in the rear.  The business of interchanging them becomes as mechanical as that of a bridge-player opening a long and strong suit; every unit knows to within two or three days its time in the front line, support line, reserve line, or rest billets.  As the units of the 3rd Division began to arrive, matters, of course, became simpler, but in the last months of the year the Corps found itself compelled to make heavy calls on the endurance of the various battalions.  [Sidenote: _Sept. 14th, 1915._]  To return to the narrative.  The 2nd Division arrived at Caestre on September 14th.  On the previous day the Canadian Corps had been formed.  Upon his appointment as Corps Commander, General Alderson relinquished the command of the 1st Division to Major-General Currie, who was in turn succeeded in the 2nd Brigade by Brigadier-General Lipsett.  Major-General Turner was already in command of the 2nd Division, and he was succeeded in the command of the 3rd Brigade by Brigadier-General Leckie.  The 16th Battalion was taken over from Brigadier-General Leckie by his brother, Major Leckie.  The changes in the Higher Command were now for the moment complete.  The duty of the 2nd Division was to relieve the 28th British Division in what may be called for convenience the Kemmel section of the line, which stretched north from the ground of the 1st Canadian Division.  As in the case of all inexperienced troops, they were given a \"trial trip,\" and their officers went in with the 84th and 85th British Brigades for a few days to learn the tricks of the trade and the lie of the land.  [Sidenote: _Sept. 23rd, 1915._] The relief was finally accomplished by September 23rd, 1915.  The 4th Brigade, 2nd Division, took the north of the line; the 5th Brigade the south; while the centre was stiffened by the hardened veterans of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division.  The 6th Brigade remained in reserve at Kemmel.  The first experience of the 2nd Division and of the new Canadian Corps was a curious one, as a glance at the dates will suggest.  The last week of September was the time of the great Anglo-French offensive, which to us spells Loos and to our Allies Champagne.  The advantage of the initiative is the uncertainty for the enemy as to where the real blow will fall.  Until he knows, he dare not shift his reserves.  The ingenuity of the Canadian Force was, therefore, exercised to produce without loss of life the appearance of an attack which would pin the Germans opposite to their ground and prevent them from going to the assistance of their sorely-pressed colleagues to the south.  The new corps rose gallantly to the demand for theatrical effect, and a demonstration was arranged along the whole line, but particularly in front of the 1st Division, opposite La Douve farm.  It must have been exciting for everyone to think out methods of simulating a bogus assault to keep the Germans on tenterhooks.  On the night of the 24th the guns opened on the enemy wire and cut great gaps thirty yards wide in it as though to open the way for the assaulting columns.  Dummy trenches were dug close behind the firing line to hold the supports of the supposed assailants.  [Sidenote: _Sept. 25th, 1915._] In the early dawn of the 25th the Germans could see great and dangerous activity in the Canadian trenches, which hummed like a hive of bees about to swarm. At 5.45 a.m. sacks full of wet straw were fired and thrown on the parapets whenever the wind blew towards the enemy.  That same morning real gas was covering in grim earnest the rush of the British over the stricken field of Lens and to the Hohenzollern Redoubt.  To intensify the effect, the platoon commanders shouted orders and blew their whistles, while scaling ladders and the shimmer of bayonets were shown above the edge of the parapet.  Our troops then opened fire, both with rifles and machine-guns.  The Germans, in the face of this provocation and menace, became convinced that an attack was imminent, though reflection might have convinced them that serious assaults are seldom so well advertised.  They put down a heavy barrage behind our firing line to prevent the arrival of supports, and thronged their own second-line trenches.  This was precisely the intention of the Canadian Command, whose gunners shelled the communication and support trenches severely.  About six o'clock in the morning, when it was too late to move troops to Loos, the false smoke thinned, and the enemy could see clearly that no attack was in progress.  The fire died away; but the German bulletin announced the successful repulse of a determined advance.  It is not surprising that the Canadians have achieved a certain unpopularity among their _vis-√†-vis_ in the trenches owing to their predilection for \"slickness.\"  Such incidents, as the men know well, relieve the monotony of trench warfare.  [Sidenote: _Sept. 26th to 30th, 1915._]  From September 26th to 30th, following this episode, certain changes were made in the British line on the right of the Canadian Corps.  The 12th Division was pulled out, to be sent further south, and a new division, the 25th, was brought up to take its place.  During the change the 3rd Brigade took over a part of the British line and acted as instructors to the inexperienced troops of the 75th British Infantry Brigade for the space of a week, when the scholars took over from the tutors.  Their place in the 2nd Division was occupied by the 6th Canadian Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General Ketchen, and until then in reserve at Kemmel.  All three brigades of the 2nd Division were now in the front line, and, as has been mentioned, they were extended two thousand yards to the north to complete the final frontage of the corps.  They possessed in Divisional Reserve Brigadier-General Seely's force, which had been replaced in the firing line by the 2nd Infantry Brigade.  The line of the 1st Division was held by this brigade and by the 1st Brigade, while the 3rd enjoyed a well-earned rest as corps reserve.  These two brigades were, however, holding the frontage of three, and it must be observed once more that the forces behind the entire British line were at this period hardly sufficient to supply adequate reliefs, much less to resist a strong attack.  This state of affairs was merely the result of the general lack of preparation of the British Empire for the duration and scale of the land war.  In the first week of October five brigades were in the front line of a six-brigade frontage, and their total reserve was four battalions of infantry and six regiments of cavalry.  During the month, however, the situation was improved, since the 42nd (Royal Highlanders of Canada), under Lieut.-Col. Cantlie, and the 49th (Edmonton Regiment), under Lieut.-Col. Griesbach, arrived on October 10th, and the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifle Brigade, under the command of Colonel Sissons, on the 26th.  [Sidenote: _Oct. 5th, 1915._]  The beginning of October was not, however, by any means without its incidents, both tragic and glorious.  On the evening of October 5th, while the great struggle round Loos was still raging, the 5th Brigade was subjected to its first severe bombardment.  The perpetual pillars of yellow and green smoke, slashed with black _d√©bris_ spouting to heaven, and the earth-shaking roar of heavy shells, are enough to try the nerve of the most trench-hardened warriors, and this brigade was but a week in the trenches and entirely new to the experience.  In these cases all depends on the example and leading of the officers.  It may be recorded here how that example was set.  Brigadier-General Watson had been moving continually up and down in the front of his brigade, and was passing through the line of the 22nd (French Canadians).  He passed Major Roy of that regiment in the muddy trench and spoke a word to him.  Hardly had he turned the traverse when out of the sky fell one of those huge abominations fired from a trench mortar. There it lay in a trench full of men, ready to explode any second. Like a flash Major Roy took his risk and dashed to save the lives of the rest.  As he stooped to pick up the great greasy cone of steel and hurl it over the parapet he slipped in the mud, and the shell exploded in his arms.  There died a very gallant gentleman, and with him all doubts as to the steadiness of the French Canadian regiment under shell fire.  Throughout the early part of October the enemy exhibited great activity in mining on the front of the Corps.  It was the turn of the New Brunswickers to show their mettle in a first raid into \"No Man's Land.\" The fibre of the race that province breeds has become indurated by generations of contest with the elements, and has taken on something of the unbending hardness of the North.  They were now to test these ingrained qualities against a new antagonist, for immediately on their front the enemy one day blew up a great mine.  [Sidenote: _Oct. 13th, 1915._]  The 26th (New Brunswick), under Lieut.-Col. McAvity, was ordered to make a reconnaissance on October 13th, and the company commanded by Major Brown held the post of honour.  If the mine crater could be occupied with advantage, then it was to be held by the attacking party; if, on the other hand, it was useless to hang on there, the crater was to be abandoned.  Imagine the infantry, bombers and bayonet men in four successive lines, straining on the leash till the artillery had finished pounding and the smoke-bombs which had been prepared to cover the advance from the sight of the German trenches had been let loose. Thrilling is the moment when warriors climb their trenches to the assault.  The New Brunswickers were untried.  But before dawn, at four o'clock, out they came from a saphead dug in advance of their trench, and raced for the crater over forty yards of open ground.  The weight of a threefold decision lay upon them.  Major Brown and Lieutenant"]]]
