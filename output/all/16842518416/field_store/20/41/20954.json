My fingerprints—”  “Yes, I know all that. But even in a WAC uniform you might be a spy. My father told me once that during the World War many spies in France wore Y. M. C. A. uniforms. They were very hard to catch. Believe me, the Mata Haris of this war will be wearing WAC uniforms, too. We have to be careful, very, very careful.” Norma settled back in her place to study the Italian girl’s face. It was indeed an interesting moving picture of lights and shadows. But from it Norma learned little.  Twice Rosa seemed on the point of replying, but in the end no words were spoken.  By this time their group, though still together, had moved to newer and more comfortable quarters in Boom Town. That night Norma lay staring at the darkness for a long time before she fell asleep.  She was thinking of Rosa and Lena. Rosa’s actions on that day had started her thinking things all over again and her thoughts were long, long thoughts.  Once again she caught the gleam of light from Rosa’s cot and saw Lena sit up in her place at night as she whispered three mysterious words.  The picture of Lena and the Spanish hairdresser standing in the moonlight again fascinated her, and once more she felt that terrifying grip on her arm as a man’s voice said, “Oh! You are one of them!”  A chapter or two had been added to Lena’s story. Betty was responsible for this. One night she had come in rather late, but had remained up long enough to whisper to Norma:  “Who do you think I saw tonight down by the big gate? Lena and the Spanish hairdresser!”  “Is that so strange?” Norma had tried to seem indifferent.  “But there was a man with them.” Betty’s whisper rose. “He had a small mustache that turned up, and sort of staring eyes.”  “Did he?” Norma’s voice betrayed her excitement.  “Yes; and he said to Lena, ‘You must!’ Only his ‘you’ sounded like ‘Du’.”  “And Lena has her hair done every other day by the Spanish hairdresser. That costs money. Do you think she always pays?”  So Betty too had a spy complex! Well, let her have it. She wasn’t going to be drawn into it. For all that, some things did seem very strange.  At that Norma turned over and fell asleep.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER IX                             SOMETHING SPECIAL   The period of their basic training at old Fort Des Moines was drawing to a close. Three more days and they would be scattered far and wide. Some, it is true, would remain for further training in the Motor Transport School, and Cooks’ and Bakers’ School. Some would take up officers’ training, but out of the thousand who had been in training for nearly four weeks, the greater number would be scattered to the four winds.  “Just think,” Betty sighed as she and Norma stepped out into a glorious springlike morning. “To leave this lovely place for some Army camp!”  “But that’s why we came here!” Norma protested. “I’m eager to start doing some real work.”  “Yes, and you’re just the one who is most likely to be kept here to enter officers’ training.” There was admiration in Betty’s voice, and a suggestion of envy. “Lucky girl, to have such a grand Dad.”  Then Norma made a strange remark. “I’m not sure that I want to be an officer—at least, not yet.”  “Don’t be silly!” Betty exploded. “Who wouldn’t like to be an officer? When you arrive at your Army camp you’re right up there with the rest of the officers.”  “Bill’s a buck private, and he’s good enough for me. Besides—Oh! Come on. Let’s get our morning coffee. This is the day of the big parade.”  Yes, this was the day. And such a glorious day! For weeks it had been too cold for a parade. Snow had lain on the parade ground. But now the snow was gone. The ground was frozen, but the sun was bright.  “Six thousand women!” Norma thought as a thrill ran up her spine.  Then suddenly her heart skipped a beat. She was to lead her own company. She was the only basic on whom such an honor had been conferred. She would do her best. Would it be good enough? Then there was that other—that very special thing. She shuddered afresh. And that morning for the first time she dropped her big handleless cup with a bang and a splash on the table.  “Nerves,” suggested Betty.  “A bad omen.” Norma frowned.  “No, a good one,” Betty countered. “Shows you’re sweating them out right now. You’ll be cool as a cucumber when the time comes.”  At one-thirty that afternoon they assembled on the parade grounds. Slowly they formed into companies and took their places in line.  Since this was to be a gala occasion, a military band from an Army post had been imported.  Each company had its flag and its leader. Norma thrilled to her finger tips as she stepped out before her “Hup! Two! Three!” Company.  “If only Dad were here!” she thought. “Why? Oh, why didn’t I ask him to come!”  By the time they were all in their places, the reviewing stand was all aglitter with officers’ insignia and decorations.  A hush fell over the ancient parade ground.  As the band struck up _The Star-Spangled Banner_ they stood at rigid attention. When this was over, Norma glanced hastily over her company. It was perfect. Never, she was sure, had there been such a group of girls.  Suddenly the band struck up Sousa’s stirring march, _The Stars and Stripes Forever_, and the parade began.  To Norma it was all a glorious dream. The flags, the music, the bright sunshine, great officers—some young and dashing, some subdued and grave, standing in review.  “But this is only the beginning,” she told herself. “There is more—much more.”  This was true, for once as she drilled her own company at dusk on the ancient grounds, having chosen a dark corner, they had put on something very special. It had been great fun, and gave them a thrill as well.  They had, however, made one mistake—the red brick officer’s home facing that corner of the parade ground was occupied by the commanding officer.  Hearing the rattle of drums, she had slipped on her fur coat and had stepped out on the veranda.  “Thrilled and charmed,” as she expressed it, by their performance, she had come down off the porch to congratulate their officer.  When she found a private at their head, she was amazed, for Norma was putting her company through an intricate drill.  “My dear, it is marvelous!” she enthused, when it was over. “And this little—ah—specialty of yours is charming. Let us keep it a secret, shall we? Until the day of the parade?”  “You mean—” Norma stared.  “Your company shall do this as something extra after the parade is over.”  Norma gulped as she recalled the stirring words.  Without a word she saluted the commanding officer.                    *       *       *       *       *  And that was why a chill sometimes ran up her spine, as the grand little army of WACs swept down the field. That certain “something extra” was yet to come.  The parade, with its marches and counter marches, in close formation and open formation, following the band down the long field and back again, was an inspiring sight. There were those there that day who realized as never before what war could do to a nation and her people.  Since it had been announced by megaphone that an extra feature would follow the grand parade, the WACs, once their formation was broken, joined the onlookers at the side, all but Norma and her company. These hastened to one of the barracks.  Marching in close formation they were soon back on the field. However, three of their members had undergone a speedy transformation. Or were they members of the company at all? The spectators were unable to tell.  Leading the trio was what appeared to be a tall, gray haired man. In his hand he carried a drum. Behind him marched a mannish figure carrying a fife, and after him came a boy, also with a drum. Hatless, the man with the fife wearing a bandage on his head; and the other two lined up behind their leader, Norma, and behind them marched the khaki-clad company.  Suddenly, at a signal from Norma, the trio snapped to attention. Instantly the roll of drums and the shrill whistle of a fife greeted the listeners’ ears.  Then, electrified, the audience knew. The three figures represented a picture they had known from childhood, _The Spirit of Seventy-six_.  Led by these three, the khaki host marched with perfect rhythm halfway down the field and back again.  An awed silence followed. Then rose such a cheer as the ancient barracks had seldom echoed back, even in the old Indian days.  Frightened—all but overcome by her sudden triumph, Norma tried to hide among her now broken ranks, but all in vain.  She was searched out and led to the grandstand. The first person she met was a distinguished-looking, gray-haired man with one empty sleeve.  “Dad!” she cried.  Soon she was being greeted by high-ranking officers and other honored guests.  “I shall recommend you for officers’ training,” the commanding officer whispered in her ear.  “Oh! But I’m not sure that I want to be an officer!” The cry escaped unbidden from Norma’s lips.  “We shall see,” was the reply.  Lieutenant Warren, her beloved Lieutenant, who was standing near, said:  “I would like to have you and your father at my house for dinner tonight. You know my house?”  Norma nodded.  “Will you come?”  Norma looked into her father’s eyes. Then she said, “Yes, thank you. That will be fine.”  As she stepped from the platform, Norma felt that she had lived a whole week in one short hour. But her day was not half done.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER X                                 I’M AFRAID   Oddly enough, when Norma had conceived the idea of depicting _The Spirit of Seventy-six_, and had gone about the task of selecting her fife player and drummers, she had discovered that in all the company there were but two drummers, Rosa and Lena.

Dorothy's Magic Belt     Author's Note   My friends the children are responsible for this new \"Oz Book,\" as they were for the last one, which was called The Land of Oz.  Their sweet little letters plead to know \"more about Dorothy\"; and they ask: \"What became of the Cowardly Lion?\" and \"What did Ozma do afterward?\"--meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of Oz.  And some of them suggest plots to me, saying: \"Please have Dorothy go to the Land of Oz again\"; or, \"Why don't you make Ozma and Dorothy meet, and have a good time together?\"  Indeed, could I do all that my little friends ask, I would be obliged to write dozens of books to satisfy their demands.  And I wish I could, for I enjoy writing these stories just as much as the children say they enjoy reading them.  Well, here is \"more about Dorothy,\" and about our old friends the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and Ozma, and all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal about some new folks that are queer and unusual.  One little friend, who read this story before it was printed, said to me: \"Billina is REAL OZZY, Mr. Baum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger.\"  If this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks find this new story \"real Ozzy,\" I shall be very glad indeed that I wrote it.  But perhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome letters from my readers, telling me just how they like \"Ozma of Oz.\"  I hope so, anyway.   L. FRANK BAUM.  MACATAWA, 1907.     1.  The Girl in the Chicken Coop   The wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean, sending ripples across its surface.  Then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until they became waves, and shoved the waves around until they became billows.  The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher even than the tops of houses.  Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall trees, and seemed like mountains; and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys.  All this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean, which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever, resulted in a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage.  At the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the waters.  When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise--first one way and then the other--and was jostled around so roughly that even the sailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.  And the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn't get through them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the terrors of the storm.  The Captain of the ship was not afraid, because he had seen storms before, and had sailed his ship through them in safety; but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck, so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the storm was over, and to keep brave hearts and not be scared, and all would be well with them.  Now, among these passengers was a little Kansas girl named Dorothy Gale, who was going with her Uncle Henry to Australia, to visit some relatives they had never before seen.  Uncle Henry, you must know, was not very well, because he had been working so hard on his Kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous.  So he left Aunt Em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the farm, while he traveled far away to Australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest.  Dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey, and Uncle Henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up; so he decided to take her along.  The little girl was quite an experienced traveller, for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the marvelous Land of Oz, and she had met with a good many adventures in that strange country before she managed to get back to Kansas again. So she wasn't easily frightened, whatever happened, and when the wind began to howl and whistle, and the waves began to tumble and toss, our little girl didn't mind the uproar the least bit.  \"Of course we'll have to stay in the cabin,\" she said to Uncle Henry and the other passengers, \"and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is over.  For the Captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard.\"  No one wanted to risk such an accident as that, you may be sure; so all the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin, listening to the shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and trying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped sidewise.  Dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to find that Uncle Henry was missing.  She couldn't imagine where he had gone, and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him, and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck.  In that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again.  The fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little sleeping-berth, but Dorothy did not know that.  She only remembered that Aunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle, so at once she decided to go on deck and find him, in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever, and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner.  Indeed, the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck, and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress.  Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm, and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her.  This might be her uncle, so she called as loudly as she could:  \"Uncle Henry!  Uncle Henry!\"  But the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own voice, and the man certainly failed to hear her, for he did not move.  Dorothy decided she must go to him; so she made a dash forward, during a lull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed to the deck with ropes.  She reached this place in safety, but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind, as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power, suddenly redoubled its fury.  With a scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the air, with Dorothy still clinging to the slats.  Around and over it whirled, this way and that, and a few moments later the chicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the big waves caught it and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then down-hill into a deep valley, as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused.  Dorothy had a good ducking, you may be sure, but she didn't lose her presence of mind even for a second.  She kept tight hold of the stout slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop, and the poor chickens were fluttering away in every direction, being blown by the wind until they looked like feather dusters without handles.  The bottom of the coop was made of thick boards, so Dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of raft, with sides of slats, which readily bore up her weight. After coughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again, she managed to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of the coop, which supported her easily enough.  \"Why, I've got a ship of my own!\" she thought, more amused than frightened at her sudden change of condition; and then, as the coop climbed up to the top of a big wave, she looked eagerly around for the ship from which she had been blown.  It was far, far away, by this time.  Perhaps no one on board had yet missed her, or knew of her strange adventure.  Down into a valley between the waves the coop swept her, and when she climbed another crest the ship looked like a toy boat, it was such a long way off. Soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom, and then Dorothy gave a sigh of regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began to wonder what was going to happen to her next.  Just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean, with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had a plank bottom and slatted sides, through which the water constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin!  And there was nothing to eat when she became hungry--as she was sure to do before long--and no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on.  \"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed, with a laugh.  \"You're in a pretty fix, Dorothy Gale, I can tell"]]]
