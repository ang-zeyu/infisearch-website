From the way the hunter moved, Sammy decided that he wasn't thinking of Mr. and Mrs. Grouse.  \"It's Lightfoot the Deer, sure as I live,\" muttered Sammy.  \"He ought to be warned. He certainly ought to be warned.  I know right where he is. I believe I'll warn him myself.\"  Sammy found Lightfoot right where he had expected to.  \"He's coming!\"  cried Sammy. \"A hunter with a terrible gun is coming!\"     CHAPTER VI: A Game Of Hide And Seek   There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once played with Buster Bear.  It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest.  In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster.  As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe.  Then, too, Danny is a very small person.  He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves.  Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort.  His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek.  It certainly does.  But Lightfoot the Deer is big.  He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest.  Being so big, it is not easy to hide.  Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill.  Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him.  He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them.  He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life.  So, standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched.  Presently over in the distance he heard Sammy Jay screaming, \"Thief, thief, thief!\"  A little sigh of relief escaped Lightfoot.  He knew that that screaming of Sammy Jay's was a warning to tell him where the hunter was.  Knowing just where the hunter was made it easier for Lightfoot to know what to do.  A Merry Little Breeze came stealing through the Green Forest. It came from behind Lightfoot and danced on towards the hunter with the terrible gun.  Instantly Lightfoot began to steal softly away through the Green Forest.  He took the greatest care to make no sound.  He went in a half-circle, stopping every few steps to listen and test the air with his wonderful nose.  Can you guess what Lightfoot was trying to do?  He was trying to get behind the hunter so that the Merry Little Breezes would bring to him the dreaded man-scent.  So long as Lightfoot could get that scent, he would know where the hunter was, though he could neither see nor hear him.  If he had remained where Sammy Jay had found him, the hunter might have come within shooting distance before Lightfoot could have located him.  So the hunter with the terrible gun walked noiselessly through the Green Forest, stepping with the greatest care to avoid snapping a stick underfoot, searching with keen eye every thicket and likely hiding-place for a glimpse of Lightfoot, and studying the ground for traces to show that Lightfoot had been there.     CHAPTER VII: The Merry Little Breezes Help Lightfoot   Could you have seen the hunter with the terrible gun and Lightfoot the Deer that morning on which the hunting season opened you might have thought that Lightfoot was hunting the hunter instead of the hunter hunting Lightfoot.  You see, Lightfoot was behind the hunter instead of in front of him. He was following the hunter, so as to keep track of him. As long as he knew just where the hunter was, he felt reasonably safe.  The Merry Little Breezes are Lightfoot's best friends.  They always bring to him all the different scents they find as they wander through the Green Forest.  And Lightfoot's delicate nose is so wonderful that he can take these scents, even though they be very faint, and tell just who or what has made them.  So, though he makes the best possible use of his big ears and his beautiful eyes, he trusts more to his nose to warn him of danger. For this reason, during the hunting season when he moves about, he moves in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes may be blowing.  He knows that they will bring to him warning of any danger which may lie in that direction.  Now the hunter with the terrible gun who was looking for Lightfoot knew all this, for he was wise in the ways of Lightfoot and of the other little people of the Green Forest.  When he had entered the Green Forest that morning he had first of all made sure of the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were coming.  Then he had begun to hunt in that direction, knowing that thus his scent would be carried behind him.  It is more than likely that he would have reached the hiding-place of Lightfoot the Deer before the latter would have known that he was in the Green Forest, had it not been for Sammy Jay's warning.  When he reached the tangle of fallen trees behind which Lightfoot had been hiding, he worked around it slowly and with the greatest care, holding his terrible gun ready to use instantly should Lightfoot leap out.  Presently he found Lightfoot's footprints in the soft ground and studying them he knew that Lightfoot had known of his coming.  \"It was that confounded Jay,\" muttered the hunter.  \"Lightfoot heard him and knew what it meant.  I know what he has done; he has circled round so as to get behind me and get my scent.  It is a clever trick, a very clever trick, but two can play at that game.  I'll just try that little trick myself.\"  So the hunter in his turn made a wide circle back, and presently there was none of the dreaded man-smell among the scents which the Merry Little Breezes brought to Lightfoot.  Lightfoot had lost track of the hunter.     CHAPTER VIII: Wit Against Wit   It was a dreadful game the hunter with the terrible gun and Lightfoot the Deer were playing in the Green Forest.  It was a matching of wit against wit, the hunter seeking to take Lightfoot's life, and Lightfoot seeking to save it. The experience of other years had taught Lightfoot much of the ways of hunters and not one of the things he had learned about them was forgotten.  But the hunter in his turn knew much of the ways of Deer.  So it was that each was trying his best to outguess the other.  When the hunter found the hiding-place Lightfoot had left at the warning of Sammy Jay he followed Lightfoot's tracks for a short distance.  It was slow work, and only one whose eyes had been trained to notice little things could have done it.  You see, there was no snow, and only now and then, when he had stepped on a bit of soft ground, had Lightfoot left a footprint.  But there were other signs which the hunter knew how to read,--a freshly upturned leaf here, and here, a bit of moss lightly crushed. These things told the hunter which way Lightfoot had gone.  Slowly, patiently, watchfully, the hunter followed.  After a while he stopped with a satisfied grin.  \"I thought as much,\" he muttered.  \"He heard that pesky Jay and circled around so as to get my scent.  I'll just cut across to my old trail and unless I am greatly mistaken, I'll find his tracks there.\"  So, swiftly but silently, the hunter cut across to his old trail, and in a few moments he found just what he expected,--one of Lightfoot's footprints.  Once more he grinned.  \"Well, old fellow, I've outguessed you this time,\" said he to himself.  \"I am behind you and the wind is from you to me, so that you cannot get my scent.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you're back right where you started from, behind that old windfall.\" He at once began to move forward silently and cautiously, with eyes and ears alert and his terrible gun ready for instant use.  Now when Lightfoot, following behind the hunter, had lost the scent of the latter, he guessed right away that the latter had found his tracks and had started to follow them.  Lightfoot stood still and listened with all his might for some little sound to tell him where the hunter was.  But there was no sound and after a little Lightfoot began to move on.  He didn't dare remain still, lest the hunter should creep up within shooting distance.  There was only one direction in which it was safe for Lightfoot to move, and that was the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were blowing. So long as they brought him none of the dreaded man-smell, he knew that he was safe.  The hunter might be behind him--probably he was--but ahead of him, so long as the Merry Little Breezes were blowing in his face and brought no man-smell, was safety.     CHAPTER IX: Lightfoot Becomes Uncertain   Lightfoot the Deer traveled on through the Green Forest, straight ahead in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were blowing.  Every few steps he would raise his delicate nose and test all the scents that the Merry Little Breezes were bringing. So long as he kept the Merry Little Breezes blowing in his face, he could be sure whether or not there was danger ahead of him.  Lightfoot uses his nose very much as you and I use our eyes.  It tells him the things he wants to know.  He knew that Reddy Fox had been along ahead of him, although he didn't get so much as a glimpse of Reddy's red coat.  Once he caught just the faintest of scents which caused him to stop abruptly and test the air more carefully than ever.  It was the scent of Buster Bear.  But it was so very faint that Lightfoot knew Buster was not near, so he went ahead again, but even more carefully than before.  After a little he couldn't smell Buster at all, so he knew then that Buster had merely passed that way when he was going to some other part of the Green Forest.  Lightfoot knew that he had nothing to fear in that direction so long as the Merry Little Breezes brought him none of the dreaded man-scent, and he knew that he could trust the Merry Little Breezes to bring him that scent if there should be a man anywhere "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4670"],["title","Lightfoot the Deer (#3)"],["body","front of him.  You know the Merry Little Breezes are Lightfoot's best friends.  But Lightfoot didn't want to keep going in that direction all day.  It would take him far away from that part of the Green Forest with which he was familiar and which he called home.  It might in time take him out of the Green Forest and that wouldn't do at all.  So after a while Lightfoot became uncertain.  He didn't know just what to do.  You see, he couldn't tell whether or not that hunter with the terrible gun was still following him.  Every once in a while he would stop in a thicket of young trees or behind a tangle of fallen trees uprooted by the wind.  There he would stand, facing the direction from which he had come, and watch and listen for some sign that the hunter was still following.  But after a few minutes of this he would grow uneasy and then bound away in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were blowing, so as to be sure of not running into danger.  \"If only I could know if that hunter is still following, I would know better what to do,\" thought Lightfoot.  \"I've got to find out.\"     CHAPTER X: Lightfoot's Clever Trick   Lightfoot the Deer is smart.  Yes, Sir, Lightfoot the Deer is smart.  He has to be, especially in the hunting season, to save his life.  If he were not smart he would have been killed long ago.  He never makes the foolish mistake of thinking that other people are not smart.  He knew that the hunter who had started out to follow him early that morning was not one to be easily discouraged or to be fooled by simple tricks.  He had a very great respect for the smartness of that hunter.  He knew that he couldn't afford to be careless for one little minute.  The certainty of danger is sometimes easier to bear than the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there really is any danger.  Lightfoot felt that if he could know just where the hunter was, he himself would know better what to do.  The hunter might have become discouraged and given up following him. In that case he could rest and stop worrying.  It would be better to know that he was being followed than not to know.  But how was he to find out?  Lightfoot kept turning this over and over in his mind as he traveled through the Green Forest.  Then an idea came to him.  \"I know what I'll do.  I know just what I'll do,\" said Lightfoot to himself.  \"I'll find out whether or not that hunter is still following me and I'll get a little rest.  Goodness knows, I need a rest.\"  Lightfoot bounded away swiftly and ran for some distance, then he turned and quickly, but very, very quietly, returned in the direction from which he had just come but a little to one side of his old trail.  After a while he saw what he was looking for, a pile of branches which woodchoppers had left when they had trimmed the trees they had cut down.  This was near the top of a little hill.  Lightfoot went up the hill and stopped behind the pile of brush.  For a few moments he stood there perfectly still, looking and listening.  Then, with a little sigh of relief, he lay down, where, without being in any danger of being seen himself, he could watch his old trail through the hollow at the bottom of the hill.  If the hunter were still following him, he would pass through that hollow in plain sight.  For a long tune Lightfoot rested comfortably behind the pile of brush.  There was not a suspicious movement or a suspicious sound to show that danger was abroad in the Green Forest.  He saw Mr. and Mrs. Grouse fly down across the hollow and disappear among the trees on the other side.  He saw Unc' Billy Possum looking over a hollow tree and guessed that Unc' Billy was getting ready to go into winter quarters.  He saw Jumper the Hare squat down under a low-hanging branch of a hemlock-tree and prepare to take a nap.  He heard Drummer the Woodpecker at work drilling after worms in a tree not far away.  Little by little Lightfoot grew easy in his mind.  It must be that that hunter had become discouraged and was no longer following him.     CHAPTER XI: The Hunted Watches The Hunter   It was so quiet and peaceful and altogether lovely there in the Green Forest, where Lightfoot the Deer lay resting behind a pile of brush near the top of a little hill, that it didn't seem possible such a thing as sudden death could be anywhere near. It didn't seem possible that there could be any need for watchfulness.  But Lightfoot long ago had learned that often danger is nearest when it seems least to be expected.  So, though he would have liked very much to have taken a nap, Lightfoot was too wise to do anything so foolish.  He kept his beautiful, great, soft eyes fixed in the direction from which the hunter with the terrible gun would come if he were still following that trail.  He kept his great ears gently moving to catch every little sound.  Lightfoot had about decided that the hunter had given up hunting for that day, but he didn't let this keep him from being any the less watchful.  It was better to be overwatchful than the least bit careless.  By and by, Lightfoot's keen ears caught the sound of the snapping of a little stick in the distance.  It was so faint a sound that you or I would have missed it altogether. But Lightfoot heard it and instantly he was doubly alert, watching in the direction from which that faint sound had come. After what seemed a long, long time he saw something moving, and a moment later a man came into view.  It was the hunter and across one arm he carried the terrible gun.  Lightfoot knew now that this hunter had patience and perseverance and had not yet given up hope of getting near enough to shoot Lightfoot.  He moved forward slowly, setting each foot down with the greatest care, so as not to snap a stick or rustle the leaves.  He was watching sharply ahead, ready to shoot should he catch a glimpse of Lightfoot within range.  Right along through the hollow at the foot of the little hill below Lightfoot the hunter passed.  He was no longer studying the ground for Lightfoot's tracks, because the ground was so hard and dry down there that Lightfoot had left no tracks.  He was simply hunting in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were blowing because he knew that Lightfoot had gone in that direction, and he also knew that if Lightfoot were still ahead of him, his scent could not be carried to Lightfoot.  He was doing what is called \"hunting up-wind.\"  Lightfoot kept perfectly still and watched the hunter disappear among the trees.  Then he silently got to his feet, shook himself lightly, and noiselessly stole away over the hilltop towards another part of the Green Forest.  He felt sure that that hunter would not find him again that day.     CHAPTER XII: Lightfoot Visits Paddy The Beaver   Deep in the Green Forest is the pond where lives Paddy the Beaver.  It is Paddy's own pond, for he made it himself.  He made it by building a dam across the Laughing Brook.  When Lightfoot bounded away through the Green Forest, after watching the hunter pass through the hollow below him, he remembered Paddy's pond. \"That's where I'll go,\" thought Lightfoot.  \"It is such a lonesome part of the Green Forest that I do not believe that hunter will come there.  I'll just run over and make Paddy a friendly call.\"  So Lightfoot bounded along deeper and deeper into the Green Forest.  Presently through the trees he caught the gleam of water. It was Paddy's pond.  Lightfoot approached it cautiously. He felt sure he was rid of the hunter who had followed him so far that day, but he knew that there might be other hunters in the Green Forest.  He knew that he couldn't afford to be careless for even one little minute.  Lightfoot had lived long enough to know that most of the sad things and dreadful things that happen in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows are due to carelessness. No one who is hunted, be he big or little, can afford ever to be careless.  Now Lightfoot had known of hunters hiding near water, hoping to shoot him when he came to drink.  That always seemed to Lightfoot a dreadful thing, an unfair thing.  But hunters had done it before and they might do it again.  So Lightfoot was careful to approach Paddy's pond upwind.  That is, he approached the side of the pond from which the Merry Little Breezes were blowing toward him, and all the time he kept his nose working.  He knew that if any hunters were hidden there, the Merry Little Breezes would bring him their scent and thus warn him.  He had almost reached the edge of Paddy's pond when from the farther shore there came a sudden crash.  It startled Lightfoot terribly for just an instant.  Then he guessed what it meant. That crash was the falling of a tree. There wasn't enough wind to blow over even the most shaky dead tree.  There had been no sound of axes, so he knew it could not have been chopped down by men. It must be that Paddy the Beaver had cut it, and if Paddy had been working in daylight, it was certain that no one had been around that pond for a long time.  So Lightfoot hurried forward eagerly, cautiously. When he reached the bank he looked across towards where the sound of that falling tree had come from; a branch of a tree was moving along in the water and half hidden by it was a brown head. It was Paddy the Beaver taking the branch to his food pile.     CHAPTER XIII: Lightfoot And Paddy Become Partners   The instant Lightfoot saw Paddy the Beaver he knew that for the time being, at least, there was no danger.  He knew that Paddy is one of the shyest of all the little people of the Green Forest and that when he is found working in the daytime it means that he has been undisturbed for a long time; otherwise he would work only at night.  Paddy saw Lightfoot almost as soon as he stepped out on the bank.  He kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplar-tree until he reached his food pile, which, you know, is in the water.  There he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches"]]]
