Still farther on the broad wheel-tracks sheered off the road, where the hurried drivers had missed the way in the dark. This was open, undulating ground, rock-strewn and overgrown with brush. A ledge of rock, a few scraggy trees, and more black, charred remains of wagons marked the final scene of the massacre.    Neale was the first man who dismounted, and Larry King was the second. They had outstripped the more cautious troopers.  “My Gawd!” breathed Larry.  Neale gripped his rifle with fierce hands and strode forward between two of the burned wagons. Naked, mutilated bodies, bloody and ghastly, lay in horrible positions. All had been scalped.  Slingerland rode up with the troops, and all dismounted, cursing and muttering.  Colonel Dillon ordered a search for anything to identify the dead. There was nothing. All had been burned or taken away. Of the camp implements, mostly destroyed, there were two shovels left, one with a burnt handle. These were used by the troopers to dig graves.  Neale had at first been sickened by the ghastly spectacle. He walked aside a little way and sat down upon a rock. His face was wet with clammy sweat. A gnawing rage seemed to affect him in the pit of the stomach. This was his first experience with the fiendish work of the savages. A whirl of thoughts filled his mind.  Suddenly he fancied he heard a low moan. He started violently. “Well, I’m hearing things,” he muttered, soberly.  It made him so nervous that he got up and walked back to where the troopers were digging. He saw the body of a woman being lowered into a grave and the sight reminded him of what Slingerland had said. He saw the scout searching around and he went over to him.  “Have you found the girl?” he asked.  “Not yet. I reckon the devils made off with her. They’d take her, if she happened to be alive.”  “God! I hope she’s dead.”  “Wal, son, so does Al Slingerland.”  More searching failed to find the body of the girl. She was given up as lost.  “I’ll find out if she was took captive,” said Slingerland. “This Sioux band has been friendly with me.”  “Man, they’re on the war-path,” rejoined Dillon.  “Wal, I’ve traded with them same Sioux when they was on the war-path.... This massacre sure is awful, an’ the Sioux will hev to be extarminated. But they hev their wrongs. An’ Injuns is Injuns.”  Slabs of rock were laid upon the graves. Then the troopers rode away.  Neale and Slingerland and Larry King were the last to mount. And it was at this moment that Neale either remembered the strange, low moan or heard it again. He reined in his horse.  “I’m going back,” he called.  “What fer?” Slingerland rejoined.  Larry King wheeled his mount and trotted back to Neale.  “Red, I’m not satisfied,” said Neale, and told his friend what he thought he had heard.  “Boy, you’re oot of yur haid!” expostulated Red.  “Maybe I am. But I’m going back. Are you coming?”  “Shore,” replied Red, with his easy good nature.  Slingerland sat his horse and watched while he waited. The dust-cloud that marked the troops drew farther away.  Neale dismounted, threw his bridle, and looked searchingly around. But Larry, always more comfortable on horseback than on land, kept his saddle. Suddenly Neale felt inexplicably drawn in a certain direction--toward a rocky ledge. Still he heard nothing except the wind in the few scraggy trees. All the ground in and around the scene of the massacre had been gone over; there was no need to examine it again. Neale had nothing tangible upon which to base his strange feeling. Yet absurd or not, he refused to admit it was fancy or emotion. Some voice had called him. He swore it. If he did not make sure he would always be haunted. So with clear, deliberate eyes he surveyed the scene. Then he strode for the ledge of rock.  Tufts of sage grew close at its base. He advanced among them. The surface of the rock was uneven--and low down a crack showed. At that instant a slow, sobbing, gasping intake of breath electrified Neale.  “Red--come here!” he yelled, in a voice that made the cowboy jump.  Neale dropped to his knees and parted the tufts of sage. Lower down the crack opened up. On the ground, just inside that crack he saw the gleam of a mass of chestnut hair. His first flashing thought was that here was a scalp the red devils did not get.  Then Red King was kneeling beside him--bending forward. “It’s a girl!”  he ejaculated.  “Yes--the one Slingerland told me about--the girl with big eyes,”  replied Neale. He put a hand softly on her head. It was warm. Her hair felt silky, and the touch sent a quiver over him. Probably she was dying.  Slingerland came riding up. “Wal, boys, what hev you found?” he asked, curiously.  “That girl,” replied Neale.  The reply brought Slingerland sliding out of his saddle.  Neale hesitated a moment, then reaching into the aperture, he got his hands under the girl’s arms and carefully drew her out upon the grass. She lay face down, her hair a tumbled mass, her body inert. Neale’s quick eye searched for bloodstains, but found none.  “I remember thet hair,” said Slingerland. “Turn her over.”  “I reckon we’ll see then where she’s hurt,” muttered Red King.  Evidently Neale thought the same, for he was plainly afraid to place her on her back.  “Slingerland, she’s not such a little girl,” he said, irrelevantly. Then he slipped his hands under her arms again. Suddenly he felt something wet and warm and sticky. He pulled a hand out. It was blood-stained.  “Aw!” exclaimed Red.  “Son, what’d you expect?” demanded Slingerland. “She got shot or cut, an’ in her fright she crawled in thar. Come, over with her. Let’s see. She might live.”  This practical suggestion acted quickly upon Neale. He turned the girl over so that her head lay upon his knees. The face thus exposed was deathly pale, set like stone in horror. The front of her dress was a bloody mass, and her hands were red.  “Stabbed in the breast!” exclaimed King.  “No,” replied Slingerland. “If she’d been stabbed she’d been scalped, too. Mebbe thet blood comes from an arrow an’ she might hev pulled it out.”  Neale bent over her with swift scrutiny. “No cut or hole in her dress!”  “Boys, thar ain’t no marks on her--only thet blood,” added Slingerland, hopefully.  Neale tore open the front of her blouse and slipped his hand in upon her breast. It felt round, soft, warm under his touch, but quiet. He shook his head.  “Those moans I heard must have been her last dying breaths,” he said.  “Mebbe. But she shore doesn’t look daid to me,” replied King. “I’ve seen daid people. Put your hand on her heart.”  Neale had been feeling for heart pulsations on her right side. He shifted his hand. Instantly through the soft swell of her breast throbbed a beat-beat-beat. The beatings were regular and not at all faint.  “Good Lord, what a fool I am!” he cried. “She’s alive! Her heart’s going! There’s not a wound on her!”  “Wal, we can’t see any, thet’s sure,” replied Slingerland.  “She might hev a fatal hurt, all the same,” suggested King.  “No!” exclaimed Neale. “That blood’s from some one else--most likely her murdered mother.... Red, run for some water. Fetch it in your hat. Slingerland, ride after the troops.”  Slingerland rose and mounted his horse. “Wal, I’ve an idee. Let’s take the girl to my cabin. Thet’s not fur from hyar. It’s a long ride to the camp. An’ if she needs the troop doctor we can fetch him to my place.”  “But the Sioux?”  “Wal, she’d be safer with me. The Injuns an’ me are friends.”  “All right. Good. But you ride after the troops, anyhow, and tell Dillon about the girl--that we’re going to your cabin.” Slingerland galloped away after the dust cloud down the trail.  Neale gazed strangely down at the face of the girl he had rescued. Her lips barely parted to make again the low moan. So that was what had called to him. No--not all! There was something more than this feeble cry that had brought him back to search; there had been some strong and nameless and inexplicable impulse. Neale believed in his impulses--in those strange ones which came to him at intervals. So far in his life girls had been rather negative influences. But this girl, or the fact that he had saved her, or both impressions together, struck deep into him; life would never again be quite the same to Warren Neale.  Red King came striding back with a sombrero full of water.  “Take your scarf and wash that blood off her hands before she comes to and sees it,” said Neale.  The cowboy was awkward at the task, but infinitely gentle. “Poor kid! I’ll bet she’s alone in the world now.”  Neale wet his scarf and bathed the girl’s face. “If she’s only fainted she ought to be reviving now. But I’m afraid--”  Then suddenly her eyes opened. They were large, violet-hued, covered with a kind of veil or film, as though sleep had not wholly gone; and they were unseeingly, staringly set with horror. Her breast heaved with a sharply drawn breath; her hands groped and felt for something to hold; her body trembled. Suddenly she sat up. She was not weak. Her motions were violent. The dazed, horror-stricken eyes roved around, but did not fasten upon anything.  “Aw! Gone crazy!” muttered King, pityingly.  It did seem so. She put her hands to her ears as if to shut out a horrible sound. And she screamed. Neale grasped her shoulders, turned her round, and forced her into such a position that her gaze must meet his.  “You’re safe!” he cried sharply. “The Indians have gone! I’m a white man!”  It seemed as though his piercing voice stirred her reason. She stared at him. Her face changed. Her lips parted and her hand, shaking like a leaf, covered them, clutched at them. The other hand waved before her as if to brush aside some haunting terror.  Neale held that gaze with all his power--dominant, masterful, masculine. He repeated what he had said.  Then it became a wonderful and terrible sight to watch her, to divine in some little way the dark and awful state of her mind. The lines, the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4684"],["title","The U. P. Trail (#7)"],["body","tenseness, the shade, the age faded out of her face; the deep-set frown smoothed itself out of her brow and it became young. Neale saw those staring eyes fix upon his; he realized a dull, opaque blackness of horror, hideous veils let down over the windows of a soul, images of hell limned forever on a mind. Then that film, that unseeing cold thing, like the shade of sleep or of death, passed from her eyes. Now they suddenly were alive, great dark-violet gulfs, full of shadows, dilating, changing into exquisite and beautiful lights.  “I’m a white man!” he said, tensely. “You’re saved! The Indians are gone!”  She understood him. She realized the meaning of his words. Then, with a low, agonized, and broken cry she shut her eyes tight and reached blindly out with both hands; she screamed aloud. Shock claimed her again. Horror and fear convulsed her, and it must have been fear that was uppermost. She clutched Neale with fingers of steel, in a grip he could not have loosened without breaking her bones.  “Red, you saw--she was right in her mind for a moment--you saw?” burst out Neale.  “Shore I saw. She’s only scared now,” replied King. “It must hev been hell fer her.”  At this juncture Slingerland came riding up to them. “Did she come around?” he inquired, curiously gazing at the girl as she clung to Neale.  “Yes, for a moment,” replied Neale.  “Wal, thet’s good.... I caught up with Dillon. Told him. He was mighty glad we found her. Cussed his troopers some. Said he’d explain your absence, an’ we could send over fer anythin’.”  “Let’s go, then,” said Neale. He tried to loosen the girl’s hold on him, but had to give it up. Taking her in his arms, he rose and went toward his horse. King had to help him mount with his burden. Neale did not imagine he would ever forget that spot, but he took another long look to fix the scene indelibly on his memory. The charred wagons, the graves, the rocks over which the naked, gashed bodies had been flung, the three scraggy trees close together, and the ledge with the dark aperture at the base--he gazed at them all, and then turned his horse to follow Slingerland.     6  Some ten miles from the scene of the massacre and perhaps fifteen from the line surveyed by the engineers, Slingerland lived in a wild valley in the heart of the Wyoming hills.  The ride there was laborsome and it took time, but Neale scarcely noted either fact. He paid enough attention to the trail to fix landmarks and turnings in his mind, so that he would remember how to find the way there again. He was, however, mostly intent upon the girl he was carrying.  Twice that he knew of her eyes opened during the ride. But it was to see nothing and only to grip him tighter, if that were possible. Neale began to imagine that he had been too hopeful. Her body was a dead weight and cold. Those two glimpses he had of her opened eyes hurt him. What should he do when she did come to herself? She would be frantic with horror and grief and he would be helpless. In a case like hers it might have been better if she had been killed.  The last mile to Slingerland’s lay through a beautiful green valley with steep sides almost like a cañon--trees everywhere, and a swift, clear brook running over a bed of smooth rock. The trail led along this brook up to where the valley boxed and the water boiled out of a great spring in a green glade overhung by bushy banks and gray rocks above. A rude cabin with a red-stone chimney and clay-chinked cracks between the logs, stuffed to bursting with furs and pelts and horns and traps, marked the home of the trapper.  “Wal, we’re hyar,” sung out Slingerland, and in the cheery tones there was something which told that the place was indeed home to him.  “Shore is a likely-lookin’ camp,” drawled Red, throwing his bridle. “Been heah a long time, thet cabin.”  “Me an’ my pard was the first white men in these hyar hills,” replied Slingerland. “He’s gone now.” Then he turned to Neale. “Son, you must be tired. Thet was a ways to carry a girl nigh onto dead.... Look how white! Hand her down to me.”  The girl’s hands slipped nervelessly and limply from their hold upon Neale. Slingerland laid her on the grass in a shady spot. The three men gazed down upon her, all sober, earnest, doubtful.  “I reckon we can’t do nothin’ but wait,” said the trapper.  Red King shook his head as if the problem were beyond him.  Neale did not voice his thought, yet he wanted to be the first person her eyes should rest upon when she did return to consciousness.  “Wal, I’ll set to work an’ clean out a place fer her,” said Slingerland.  “We’ll help,” rejoined Neale. “Red, you have a look at the horses.”  “I’ll slip the saddles an’ bridles,” replied King, “an’ let ‘em go. Hosses couldn’t be chased out of heah.”  Slingerland’s cabin consisted really of two adjoining cabins with a door between, one part being larger and of later construction. Evidently he used the older building as a storeroom for his pelts. When all these had been removed the room was seen to be small, with two windows, a table, and a few other crude articles of home-made furniture. The men cleaned this room and laid down a carpet of deer hides, fur side up. A bed was made of a huge roll of buffalo skins, flattened and shaped, and covered with Indian blankets. When all this had been accomplished the trapper removed his fur cap, scratched his grizzled head, and appealed to Neale and King.  “I reckon you can fetch over some comfortable-like necessaries--fixin’s fer a girl,” he suggested.  Red King laughed in his cool, easy, droll way. “Shore, we’ll rustle fer a lookin’-glass, an’ hair-brush, an’ such as girls hev to hev. Our camp is full of them things.”  But Neale did not see any humor in Slingerland’s perplexity or in the cowboy’s facetiousness. It was the girl’s serious condition that worried him, not her future comfort.  “Run out thar!” called Slingerland, sharply.  Neale, who was the nearest to the door, bolted outside, to see the girl sitting up, her hair disheveled, her manner wild in the extreme. At sight of him she gave a start, sudden and violent, and uttered a sharp cry. When Neale reached her it was to find her shaking all over. Terrible fear had never been more vividly shown, yet Neale believed she saw in him a white man, a friend. But the fear in her was still stronger than reason.  “Who are you?” she asked.  “My name’s Neale--Warren Neale,” he replied, sitting down beside her. He took one of the shaking hands in his. He was glad that she talked rationally.  “Where am I?”  “This is the home of a trapper. I brought you here. It was the best--in fact, the only place.”  “You saved me--from--from those devils?” she queried, hoarsely, and again the cold and horrible shade veiled her eyes.  “Yes--yes--but don’t think of them--they’re gone,” replied Neale, hastily. The look of her distressed and frightened him. He did not know what to say.  The girl fell back with a poignant cry and covered her eyes as if to shut out a hateful and appalling sight. “My--mother!” she moaned, and shuddered with agony. “They--murdered--her!... Oh! the terrible yells!... I saw--killed--every man--Mrs. Jones! My mother--she fell--she never spoke! Her blood was on me!... I crawled away--I hid!... The Indians--they tore--hacked--scalped--burned!... I couldn’t die!--I saw!... Oh!--Oh!--Oh!” Then she fell to moaning in inarticulate fashion.  Slingerland and King came out and looked down at the girl.  “Wal, the life’s strong in her,” said the trapper. “I reckon I know when life is strong in any critter. She’ll git over thet. All we can do now is to watch her an’ keep her from doin’ herself harm. Take her in an’ lay her down.”  For two days and nights Neale watched over her, except for the hours she slept, when he divided his vigil with King. She had periods of consciousness, in which she knew Neale, but most of the time she raved or tossed or moaned or lay like one dead. On the third day, however. Neale felt encouraged. She awoke weak and somber, but quiet and rational. Neale talked earnestly to her, in as sensible a way as he knew how, speaking briefly of the tragic fate that had been hers, bidding her force it out of her mind by taking interest in her new surroundings. She listened to him, but did not seem impressed. It was a difficult matter to get her to eat. She did not want to move. At length Neale told her that he must go back to the camp of the engineers, where he had work to do; he promised that he would return to see her soon and often. She did not speak or raise her eyes when he left her.  Outside, when Red brought up the horses, Slingerland said to Neale: “See hyar, son, I reckon you needn’t worry. She’ll come around all right.”  “Shore she will,” corroborated the cowboy. “Time’ll cure her. I’m from Texas, whar sudden death is plentiful in all families.”  Neale shook his head. “I’m not so sure,” he said. “That girl’s more sensitively and delicately organized than you fellows see. I doubt if she’ll ever recover from the shock. It’ll take a mighty great influence.... But let’s hope for the best. Now, Slingerland, take care of her as best you can. Shut her in when you leave camp. I’ll ride over as often as possible. If she gets so she will talk, then we can find out if she has any relatives, and if so I’ll take her to them. If not I’ll do whatever else I can for her.”  “Wal, son, I like the way you’re makin’ yourself responsible fer thet kid,” replied the trapper. “I never had no wife nor daughter. But I’m thinkin’--wouldn’t it jest be hell to be a girl--tender an’ young an’ like Neale said--an’ sudden hev all you loved butchered before your eyes?”  “It shore would,” said Red, feelingly. “An’ thet’s what she sees all the time.”  “Slingerland, do we run any chance of meeting Indians?” queried Neale.  “I reckon not. Them Sioux will git fur away from hyar after thet massacre. But you want to keep sharp eyes out, an’ if you do meet any, jest ride an’ shoot your way through. You’ve the"]]]
