Next come the Farman artillery machines. They are like the reconnoissance machines, too cumbersome for fighting, but are best equipped for the purpose of \"réglage\"—controlling the fire of batteries. While the small Nieuports have a carrying capacity of only two hundred and twenty pounds, these unwieldy creatures are able to take on over five hundred pounds, which includes the weight of the two men, their clothes, cameras, the wireless, and the gun and its ammunition.  In this branch of aviation the weight of the pilot does not matter so very much, whereas in the case of the little Nieuports, if the aviator exceeds the prescribed weight, he has to choose between not piloting the machine or starting on his flight with a supply of gasolene reduced by the amount of his excess weight.  Finally, there are the heavy-armored bombardment machines, with a carrying capacity of over one thousand pounds. They are the slowest machines of all, and their work is both tiring and tiresome, as their flights are made mostly by night. They are armed with mitrailleuses or small, non-recoil cannon, but on account of their low speed their daylight flights are attended by \"escadrilles de chasse.\"  They are also detailed for guarding cities.  In the early months of the war each aviator was usually assigned to any one of these types of machines at hazard. At the school which he attended the instruction he received was specialized for the work which that particular machine could perform.  Since then, however, it has been found more advisable to train all beginners on one of the heavier machines.  The reason is this: Fighting, although the safest work, requires the most experienced pilot.  It is the most important work of all—or rather it calls for greater attributes of skill, courage, and knowledge.  The famous aviators of whom we read in the daily communiqués, like Navarre, Nungesser, Vialet, and Guynemer, all gained their reputation with the small, fighting Nieuports.  A pilot is consequently promoted from a reconnoissance machine to an \"appareil de chasse\" after he has had two or three months’ experience at the front and his captain has indorsed his application.  There are exceptions to this rule.  The most notable is the American Escadrille, which consists entirely of fighting machines.  The volunteers from the United States who applied for this duty were considered such naturally good aviators that they were accorded the exceptional honor of being assigned immediately to the fighting Nieuports.  When I first reported at the aviation headquarters they offered to let me go directly to the combat school because I was an American.  I refused.  \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do,\" I thought, and so expressed my preference for a French escadrille.  I knew that by doing so I would put in a longer apprenticeship, but that in the end it would make a much better fighting pilot of me.  Having chosen this course, I was ordered to report to the school at Chartres.                             *THE SCHOOL AT CHARTRES*   Most Americans know Chartres only for its beautiful Gothic cathedral, which, since its construction in the eleventh century, has been regarded as one of the finest edifices of France.  Those of us who, since the war began, have had occasion to visit Chartres, have found there other interests besides the little, straggling streets, the historic old houses, and the beautiful monuments and memorials to men, like Pasteur and Marceau, who brought fame to their native city in peace as well as in war.  Not far from the centre of the town lie the vast aviation-fields—close by the little village of Bretigny, where the treaty of peace which concluded the One Hundred Years’ War was signed over five centuries ago.  Little did the soldiers who met on that historic battle-field dream that to-day their descendants would be training for an even greater conflict, in which the combatants not only clinch below ground but also fight aerial battles high above the clouds.  As Chartres was a great cavalry headquarters of the French army before the war, to-day many of the horses shipped over from the western plains of North America are sent there the moment they are unloaded from the steamers at Bordeaux.  Many a morning from my window I have seen the square below filled with a moving mass of animals on their way to the near-by remount depots.  Twice I saw whole regiments of cavalry leaving for the front.  So steadily and so quietly did those mounts move in ranks that it seemed as if they had acquired some of their riders’ dogged determination and sense of responsibility.  The aviation school at Chartres is as large as the one I had recently left, and its organization is the same.  In fact, it is only one of a dozen equally large and important schools located in various parts of France—all of which is bound to make a great impression upon Americans when they appreciate the insufficiency of aviation schools in our own country.  At Chartres there are three fields.  Two of these are reserved for the use of the double-control machines, while the third, the \"Grande Piste,\" serves as a practice-field for the élèves who are about to come up for their pilots’ examinations.  As soon as I had reported my arrival to the officer in charge, and had complied with the usual formalities, I was assigned to an \"équipe,\" which in English means a \"team.\"  There were twelve of these \"équipes\" under instruction at all times, comprising a dozen pupils apiece, and each having its own double-control machine and an instructor.  Half of the number are always making use of one of the two smaller fields, while the remaining six use the other.  The instruction in this way progresses rapidly.  The \"moniteur\" first takes each pupil for a few rides to see how the latter takes to the air. The élève must follow every move of his pilot, until he appears perfectly at home in the machine, and then he is allowed to hold the controls alone. Each flight lasts only about five minutes, the French theory being that an aviator must take his instruction in small doses. In the interim, as in the preliminary courses, he remains on the field, observing and studying the mistakes of his comrades. If the progress of the instruction is too rapid, the pupil has not the time to grasp each step that has been passed and cannot, therefore, become an expert pilot.  The double control works in this way: The controls and the pedals of the pupil are a duplicate set of those of the \"moniteur,\" or instructor, and have the same connections with the engine and steering apparatus. Either set will steer the machine.  The pupil takes hold of the controls and places his feet on the pedals. Every motion of the instructor is reproduced in the pupil’s control and pedals—their hands and feet move together.  In this way the pupil develops a reflex action and instinct for doing the right thing. Each day, weather permitting, at least half a dozen flights are made by a pupil. Gradually the \"moniteur\" allows him to control the machine.  Suddenly he finds himself running the biplane alone, with his instructor riding as a passenger behind him and merely giving him a word of advice or caution from time to time.  Landing is the most difficult part of aviation to master.  A great many of the accidents occur because the aviator has made a poor contact with the ground.  In fact, in the early days of aviation most of the accidents occurred near the ground, and this led people to speculate on the peculiar action of the lower air currents.  These, in reality, had little to do with it.  The cause lay in the inability of the pilots to know how to make proper contacts and to appreciate the fact which we now know to be a fundamental principle, that the engine should be shut off before a machine catches the air and volplanes down against the wind. There are exceptions to this rule, but not for a beginner.  Sometimes it is necessary for the pilot to descend against a strong wind.  In order to maintain the required speed the motor must be left partially turned on.  Generally it is most important to turn off the motor, because if the landing is made with the wind, even in the gentlest breeze, the aeroplane, on account of the speed of the tail wind, is likely to turn a somersault and be completely smashed up.  Even then another manoeuvre has to be mastered.  Just before alighting the pilot must make a quick upward turn, so that at the moment of contact the machine may be travelling parallel with the ground.  Formerly the importance of this little upward turn of the rudder was not fully appreciated by aviators, and many a machine was wrecked by a sudden hard compact with the earth.  When the \"moniteur\" sees that his pupil has acquired the knack of making a landing he passes on to the all-important manoeuvre of volplaning, and the dreaded \"perte de vitesse\" is tackled.  Lastly, but not least, comes the \"virage\"—turn, or bank, as we say in English.  These rudimentary principles are all that are required of the élève before he may go up alone, or be \"lâché.\"  During this phase of my instruction it was repeatedly impressed upon me that, if anything ever happened to me when I was in the air and I did not immediately realize what to do, I was to let go of the controls, turn off the motor, and let the machine take charge of itself.  The modern aeroplane is naturally so stable that, if not interfered with, it will always attempt to right itself before the dreaded \"vrille\" occurs, and fall \"en feuille morte.\"  Like a leaf dropping in an autumn breeze is what this means, and no other words explain the meaning better.  A curious instance of this happened one day as I was watching the flights and waiting for my turn.  I was particularly interested in a machine that had just risen from the \"Grande Piste.\"  It was acting "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46299"],["title","With the French Flying Corps (#4)"],["body","peculiarly.  Suddenly its motor was heard to stop.  Instead of diving it commenced to wabble, indicating a \"perte de vitesse.\"  It slipped off on the wing and then dove. I watched it intently, expecting it to turn into the dreaded spiral.  Instead it began to climb.  Then it went off on the wing, righted itself, again slipped off on the wing, volplaned, and went off once more.  This extraordinary performance was repeated several times, while each time the machine approached nearer and nearer to the ground.  I thought that the pilot would surely be killed.  Luck was with him, however, for his slip ceased just as he made contact with the ground, and he settled in a neighboring field.  It was a very bumpy landing, but the aeroplane was undamaged.  The officers rushed to the spot to find out what was the matter.  They found the pilot unconscious but otherwise unhurt. Later, in the hospital, he explained that the altitude had affected his heart and that he had fainted.  As he felt himself going he remembered his instructions and relinquished the controls, at the same moment stopping his motor. His presence of mind and his luck had saved his life—his luck, I say, for had the machine not righted itself at the moment of touching the ground it would have been inevitably wrecked.  This was a practical demonstration of the expediency of the French method of instruction, and before long it was to serve me also in good stead.  One day, after I had flown for several hours in the double-control machine, my \"moniteur\" told me that he thought me qualified to be \"lâché,\" and that I was to go up alone the following morning.  I felt very proud and confided my feelings to one of my friends who had been qualified a few hours earlier.  While we were talking he was called upon to make his first independent flight.  We watched him leave the ground, rise, and then make his turns. He was doing remarkably well for a beginner, but when he came down for his landing he did not redress his machine in time and it crushed him to the ground, with fatal result. This completely unnerved me.  I lost all desire to fly the following day, and prayed earnestly for rain. The next morning, however, was beautifully clear.  The captain was there to watch my flight.  I was loath to go up, but I had no alternative.  The mechanics rolled out a single-control biplane for my use and I climbed in.  The motor was started.  With its crackling noise my nerve almost deserted me again.  I should have felt less frightened, probably, had no one been looking on, but my \"moniteur,\" my captain, and all my comrades stood there, interested to see how I would handle myself.  I had to see the thing through, so I opened the throttle.  The machine began to roll along the ground, then to bounce, and then, in response to a pull on the control, to fly.  I was flying alone.  The thought filled me with alarm.  I rose to less than two hundred feet, but it seemed prodigious.  Then I made a turn.  When I found that I was flying smoothly and easily I felt a little more confident.  As I turned back toward the field I could see my masters and comrades below looking up at me. Another machine was about to leave the field.  It seemed no larger than a huge insect as it glided across the ground.  I made up my mind that I was going to make good.  If others could do it, I could. I volplaned down, and made my landing safely but somewhat bumpily.  The captain told me that I would do, but he would like me to make another turn.  I went up again.  This time I made a faultless landing.  I had passed my test satisfactorily. I felt happy and confident.  I was now qualified to \"conduct\" an aeroplane alone, and in a few weeks I would be allowed to try for a brevet as military pilot.  There were several other pilots whose turns to pass to the \"Grande Piste\" came before mine.  I had, therefore, to wait for several days, which I used to advantage in taking up the old \"double-control\" machine alone.  In this way I was able to make several ascensions and landings every morning and every night.  This was to be of the greatest service to me later, for during these practice flights I acquired perfect confidence in myself.  At other times, both before and after working hours, my \"moniteur\" would take me up with him as a passenger for a newly discovered sport. We would rush along the ground, barely two feet above it, and put up partridges, which abounded in the greatest numbers. Our speed would enable us to overtake and hit them with the wires of the machine and kill them.  Running along the ground in this way is always attended with danger, but it was real sport.  One morning in twenty minutes we killed six partridges in this novel manner.  Finally my turn came.  I graduated from the beginners’ class at \"La Mare de Grenouille\" to the company of the more finished pilots of the \"Grande Piste.\"  The beginners’ field is called the \"frog’s meadow,\" because the landings are so hoppy.  On the \"Grande Piste\" we had newer and faster machines, and we could fly alone and go practically anywhere we wished. Six pilots were assigned to one aeroplane.  We had to divide up the time equally between each pilot, so as to give every one an opportunity of making at least two flights both morning and afternoon.  A maximum height was imposed upon each \"équipe,\" and this was gradually increased from five hundred feet to a thousand, and then to one thousand five hundred, as we became more and more adept.  Most of our time was given to making landings and to accustoming ourselves to volplaning.  The motor had to be reduced at a predetermined distance from the field, and the rest of the descent made by volplaning to a given spot.  Spirals were also made during each flight.  We would select our landing-places and prepare ourselves for the \"atterrissage\" by reducing our motor, making due allowance for the drive of the wind. At about two hundred feet from the ground we would suddenly turn on the motor again, tilt up the tail, and resume our flights.  This was excellent practice and gave us more and more confidence in our own ability to come down wherever we wished.  The average layman cannot understand why aviators spend so much time turning in spirals as they approach the ground.  It is because they are manoeuvring for position to hold their headway and land against the wind, as does a sailing ship when beating up a harbor against wind and tide.  Every day I took my machine up higher and higher until I had gradually increased my altitude to two thousand feet.  Here, one day, I had a narrow escape.  I had received orders to make a flight during a snow-storm.  I rose to the prescribed height and then prepared to make my descent.  A whirling squall caught me in the act of making a spiral. I felt the tail of my machine go down and the nose point up.  I had a classical \"perte de vitesse.\"  I looked out and saw that I was less than eight hundred feet above the ground, and approaching it at an alarming rate of speed.  I had already shut off the motor for the spiral, and turning it on, I knew, would not help me in the least. Suddenly I remembered the pilot who fainted.  I let go of everything, and with a sickening feeling I looked down at the up-rushing ground.  At that instant I felt the machine give a lurch and right itself.  I grabbed the controls, turned on the motor and resumed my line of flight only two hundred feet in the air.  All this happened in a few seconds, but my helplessness seemed to have lasted for hours. I had had a very close call—not as close as the man who fainted, but sufficiently so for me.  [Illustration: \"I had received orders to make a flight during a snow-storm.\" The author, together with his first mechanic, at the \"mitrailleuse.\" The second mechanic is standing on the wing.]  Since that day I have seen several other pilots experience a loss of speed under similar circumstances.  Thanks to the thorough instruction which we had received previous to our being allowed to fly alone, their lives, as well as my own, were saved. Later we learned how the very dangers which we had experienced as new aviators often become the safety of expert pilots.                            *PASSING THE FINAL TESTS*   My équipe was now making flights at three thousand feet and was remaining up for an hour at a time.  We had all flown alone for thirty hours and were ready for our \"épreuves.\"  The weather was cloudy, however, and as our first examination was to be a height test, we had to wait until it cleared.  It would have been extremely difficult—in fact, almost impossible—for us to go up under existing conditions.  The first two tests which we were required to pass involved ascensions of six thousand feet; then an hour at ten thousand. If we passed these satisfactorily we would next be required to take a triangular voyage of one hundred and fifty miles, making a landing at each corner of the triangle. Lastly, there was the ordeal of going up to an altitude of one thousand five hundred feet, where the motor had to be cut off and the descent made by spirals to a previously determined spot.  The day on which we were required to begin our altitude flights the captain assigned three machines to our équipe—that is, one aero-biplane for each pair. My chum, a sous-lieutenant, and I were assigned to the same machine.  We matched to see which one of us should use it first. He won and I helped him prepare for the test.  I fastened on his recording barometer, which indicates the altitude reached by a machine, and he climbed in.  Waving us a cheery \"Au revoir,\" he started off.  His machine climbed fast.  To us he seemed to be going too steeply.  We felt like shouting to him to be careful, but we knew it was useless. Suddenly his machine slipped off on the wing.  For some unknown reason he failed to shut off his motor.  His biplane engaged in the fatal spiral.  There was a loud report, like a cannon-shot, and the machine collapsed.  The strain had"]]]
