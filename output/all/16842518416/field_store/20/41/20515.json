But this army of Russian peasants did not altogether believe the atrocity stories, did not in the least believe that England was there for the good of Russia or for the general good of mankind, and did not want to fight.                                      *XII*                            *MAKING BOLSHEVIKI*   In May General Miller, the Russian commander at Archangel, issued a proclamation calling upon all people of Bolshevist sympathies to leave Archangel within a prescribed time, offering them transport to the Bolshevik lines and two days’ rations, and threatening severe penalties to all who failed to go.  This was startling. All the Bolsheviki had left when we came in. None had been permitted to come in since the campaign began.  Where, then, did these come from who were reported officially as being in Archangel in \"large numbers\"?  The obvious answer is the correct one.  They had developed Bolshevist sympathies in Archangel.  Some of them took their two days’ rations and crossed the line, the military command ordered quite a number of them shot, but others kept springing from the ground until the British command had ample ground for its theory that if you scratch a Russian you find a Bolshevik.  How are these numerous Bolsheviki to be accounted for?  They were made in Archangel. They were made by the British militarists, the Russian monarchists and the Bolshevik propagandists.  The making of Bolsheviki in Archangel had not proceeded according to the pet American theory of Bolshevist-making.  They had not been made by hunger.  Archangel had been fed.  Not by charity, but by work.  Plenty of work, fair pay, and ample supplies.  The first great step in the process of making Bolsheviki was the conscription of men for the army.  This was not done until ample opportunity had been given everybody to enlist voluntarily, but not everybody volunteered.  The Russian point of view and ours were quite different in this matter.  We had undertaken to fight the Bolsheviki for him and he was glad to have us do it.  Our men and officers, on the other hand, declared it was preposterous to suppose they were going to do this fighting while the \"lazy Russians stayed at home.\"  So conscription went into force.  At first a small class of young men, then a larger class, and finally practically every able-bodied man from seventeen to fifty.  Here was another story. Here was war, real war, again.  The new thing called Military Intervention or Allied Assistance or anything else had proved to be the old thing that Russia knew so well.  And the peasant of North Russia did not want it.  As early as January some of these conscripted companies at Shenkursk went over bodily to the Bolsheviki.  The suppression of all expressions of interest in Russia’s \"new-found freedom\" was a stupid blunder.  There were no public meetings, no open discussion of political questions, no real freedom of the press.  The Russian soldiers were even afraid to sing the \"Marseillaise,\" and confined themselves to the innocuous if beautiful folksongs, leaving all of the many excellent freedom songs of the revolution to the exclusive use of the Bolsheviki.  The British never discovered that the Russian loves these freedom songs, because they took counsel solely of the reactionary monarchist element they had placed in power.  I have known a single strain of one of these freedom songs to throw a roomful of people into panic with fear that it meant a fresh revolt. And I have seen a crowd of Russian soldiers respond with keen pleasure when their officer, a friend of mine with whom I had talked the matter over, told them to go ahead and sing the so-called Bolshevist songs.  This was toward the end of the chapter of Military Intervention.  The suspension of all kinds of democratic and political experiment and experience by the Military Intervention was a matter of grave consequence.  After a year of Military Intervention a member of a Zemstvo Upravda said to me, \"We have made no progress in government. We have lost ground.  It could not have been worse under the Bolsheviki.\" The people under Military Intervention felt that they were robbed of the freedom they had waited for so long and enjoyed such a little time.  The belief that the Bolsheviki would have robbed them equally or worse comforted them for a time, but this comfort wore away as time stretched on and Military Intervention made constantly increasing demands upon them.  Conscription for the army was accompanied by labor conscription.  This was followed by more labor conscription.  This labor was employed largely in building something to be blown up, loading cargoes to be reloaded, hauling supplies backward to be hauled forward again and other ostensibly wasteful operations which accompany all military operations, more or less, in this case more.  This conscripted and wasted labor was taken away from farm work at times when it could not be spared without the loss of a season’s crop.  But it had to be done and military necessities do not take farm seasons into account.  The Military Intervention had been here all winter and had consumed every bit of the country’s surplus.  This year there must be a big crop or starvation. It has been a good crop but a small one because of labor conscription. And those \"ignorant\" peasants can tell you what that means to them however many useless paper roubles the Military Intervention may leave behind it.  The execution of suspects made Bolsheviki right and left.  The inquisitorial processes of the Russian puppets of the Military Intervention were necessarily so much like those of the old régimé that they went far to dispel all illusions about the Military Intervention that might have remained in the peasant mind.  When night after night the firing squad took out its batches of victims it mattered not that no civilians were permitted on the streets. There were thousands of listening ears to hear the rat-tat-tat of the machine guns, and no morning paper could have given all the gruesome details more complete circulation than they received in the regular process of universal news gossip by which Archangel keeps itself in up-to-the-minute touch with all local affairs.  The details were well known.  Some one had seen it all.  Some one also thought he knew who were to be included in the new batch tonight.  These little gossip groups discussed freely the merits of the shooting and the charges.  The Military Intervention tried to prevent this but it couldn’t.  Every victim had friends.  These friends and their friends rapidly were made enemies of the Military Intervention.  And this enmity naturally spelled Bolshevism, as far as the Military Intervention was concerned.  I witnessed the anguish of one woman whose husband and father were both in prison as suspects.  They had both won honor in the war against Germany.  The husband had been wounded.  The charges of Bolshevist sympathy on which they were arrested were based on slight evidence.  She could not visit them. Only through the underground methods of the native Russians could she learn anything about them.  She, too, listened every night for the rat-tat-tat until she could bear it no longer.  So she was arrested a few days before I left Archangel for having said something for which the Military Intervention could not stand. Another Bolshevik.  If the Russian soldiers whom we organized, equipped, and paid to fight the Bolsheviki went over as they did in whole companies to the Bolsheviki it was not because of any lure or reward that our enemies held out to them.  It was because we in our stupidity thought of them as \"swine\" and employed such methods of administration and control in our Military Intervention as they had been only too familiar with in the old days of Tsarism.  We failed to win their hearts or their confidence.  We destroyed all their illusions about us.  And they turned \"Bolshevik.\"  Of course English and American soldiers did not turn Bolshevik, but it was startling sometimes to hear their exclamations of sympathy with the Bolsheviki and their protests against the whole fact and practice of the Military Intervention.  This was not unusual among the Americans and Canadians of the winter army and was so common among the new army that I felt at one time they were more likely to make trouble for the Military Intervention than the Russians were.  A gentleman who was very much in sympathy with the Military Intervention was lecturing to an audience of these men one night in Archangel on \"Why are we here?\"  His lecture had been O.K.’d carefully by the Intelligence Department and was considered safe, in fact, most excellent.  After the lecture the men were given an opportunity to ask questions, and some of the questions they asked were, \"Is England going to take the port of Murmansk?\" \"Did a British syndicate get control of the lumber industry of Archangel?\" \"Who cashed in on the new rouble deal?\" \"Are we trying to set up a monarchy here in Russia?\"  This from British Tommies was too much.  The Intelligence Department sent around word the next morning that this lecture had better not be given any more.  What the troops needed was entertainment and amusement.                                      *XIII*                          *THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN*   The relations between the English and the Russians were not on the whole pleasant or friendly.  The English themselves do not know this.  So long as they were not shooting each other there was nothing missing in the estimation of the average English soldier in his relations with the Russians.  Feeling at heart the pressure of the white man’s burden he had great scorn for the white Russians who now had added to its weight.  I have heard English officers curse Russian soldiers so violently that I knew they were giving themselves boldness under cover of their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46191"],["title","Fighting Without a War: An Account of Military Intervention in North Russia (#7)"],["body","tongue, and I knew too that the soldiers were refraining from protest under the pretense of not understanding.  I once heard an English captain call three Russian captains \"filthy swine\" in their hearing and one of the Russians afterward told me in perfectly good English that he had frequently been so abused by Englishmen who thought he did not understand their words.  This word \"swine,\" in fact, was the favorite appellation of the English for the Russians.  Since it is necessary in this writing to generalize about the Englishmen and British officers somewhat I must say here that there were among them some splendid men.  I had the privilege of knowing a few who are among the finest men to be met anywhere—tactful, human, sympathetic, and strong.  But these were too small a minority.  The expedition called for military skill and it called for leadership, sympathy, social skill. There was a sad failure to realize that an expedition of this sort is bound to run into social and political problems that are quite as important, perhaps more so, than mere military practice.  The management of this campaign has ignored all social and political considerations that might have contributed to its success or failure and has blundered stupidly whenever these matters have forced themselves to the front.  And the military blunders have been so obvious that they have been openly acknowledged in part and are on record presumably in the war office today.  The failure of the North Russian Expedition was the failure of the British to make friends of the Russian people.  There was no purpose of conquest here.  The purpose of his government was to be helpful to the Russian people. But the British soldier does not think in these terms. He had been a pupil in the school of imperialism too long to become a conscious knight-errant of the League of Nations so suddenly.  He took his imperialism to Russia with him, and Russia would not stand for it. He failed in Russia and the causes of his failure were:  1. The Russian distrust and dislike of the British.  2.  The British inability to understand the Russian mind.    3. The British lack of respect for the Russian character.  4.  The British tactlessness in dealing with the Russians.    5. The stupid propaganda conducted by the British.   6. The British war-weariness.  Probably the last of these reasons is the one that will seem most important to those who have been hearing the noise made by English politicians, but I believe it to be the least.  It did not prevent the sending out of that fine new army with its marvelous supplies of stores and equipment.  It did not spoil those precious plans for getting to Petrograd before winter. For it was neither British Labor nor the Bolsheviki that drove the British army from North Russia.  It was the peasant population of North Russia that did this.  In April, May, and June I was told dozens of times by Russians that if the Americans left Russia, the English would be compelled to go. They did not believe the British would withdraw voluntarily.  They expected to have to fight to drive them out.  Some of them said they would ask the Bolsheviki to help them. Constantly new causes of irritation arose between the military and the peasants and violent expressions of military disgust with \"swine\" were increasingly heard.  When things went wrong all blame was laid on the Russians. And it was laid on them in such a way as to increase the malady.  Each day bitterness, distrust, and resentment increased on both sides.  In August a British colonel said to me that he feared nothing from our enemies the Bolsheviki but everything from our friends the Russians, and he doubted if they would let us get out without another great tragedy of treachery.  In August also a Russian officer told a friend of mine that the quicker the English got away the surer they were of getting away safely.  No Russian believed in the disinterestedness of England’s motives.  All kinds of stories were invented and believed as to the concessions and ports she was to receive, as to the debt Russia would owe her after the war, and as to King George’s interest in the restoration of the Czar to his throne.  Bolshevik propaganda was not idle and was all too easily believed.  The Russians knew, too, that the English liked the monarchists, took them into their confidence, had them to dinner, danced with them, and they came to believe that with England in North Russia the revolution was lost.  It was a common thing to hear an English officer say that every Russian was a Bolo.  And this appellation was intended to be most opprobrious. A discussion of this charge involves an understanding of Bolos as well as of other Russians, and the statement emanates from an utter lack of such understanding.  I must say that the great number of Russians that I have come to know somewhat are not at all open to the charge of being like the British idea of Bolos.  They are, on the contrary, loyal, generous, honest, and reliable; neither crazy radicals nor indolent dreamers, but a plodding, persistent, patient people who also can dream dreams and turn over new pages.  On our way back to Archangel in the very last days of August we welcomed almost any suggestion that seemed to afford a pleasant justification for our retreat, and we talked much about the failure of Kolchak to meet us at Kotlas or Viatka and the unwisdom of risking another winter with Archangel for a base and such impossible lines of communication as we maintained last winter.  In truth we were quite willing to realize that what we had undertaken to do there was from a military point of view stupid and utterly impractical.  We did not believe anybody would ever again attempt to invade Russia from the north.  But the political stupidity of our mission and our methods was never suspected, and English officers continued to talk about \"swine.\"                                      *XIV*                                *ATROCITIES*   The men of this expedition were told many stories of Bolshevik atrocities.  No care or effort was spared in printing these stories in both English and Russian and getting them into the hands of the soldiers.  It was important to inspire fear and hatred of the Bolsheviki in the hearts of our men, more important than the verification of the stories.  After the evacuation of Shenkursk we were told, with complete details, of the murder of the nuns and the Abbess, and of the members of several families who were well known to us, also of the forced marriage to favored Bolsheviki of some of the young ladies who in the happy days had danced with our officers.  We were told of rape and of tortures, all in convincing circumstantial setting.  This \"information\" we were told had been obtained most cleverly by us through spies and prisoners—and it did its work.  In July, however, we learned the truth—at least I did. Three Russians whom I had known all winter and in whom I have the utmost confidence, went to Shenkursk, stayed there incognito a week, and came back.  They told me that they had seen the nuns, and talked with the people who were supposed to have been murdered, that the Abbess was alive, that the girls were unmarried, and that there had been no forced marriages whatever.  The one atrocity and the only one committed by the Bolsheviki in Shenkursk was the shooting of one priest.  One priest was shot in the street by soldiers without official sanction.  The only other Bolshevik atrocity about which I had any authentic information throughout the entire expedition was the mutilation of the bodies of some of our men who had been killed in the early days of Ustpadenga.  I was unable to find any one who had any proof, however, that they had ever killed our men whom they had once taken prisoner.  Perhaps they did it, but even so we were there not to imitate their worst practices but to wipe them off the face of the earth because of those practices.  A friend of mine was walking unarmed on a lonely road near the front one day when a Bolshevik soldier came out of the woods and made a friendly approach.  He asked my friend if it was safe to go in and give himself up as a prisoner and was assured that it was.  They went in together, the guard at the barricade took charge of the prisoner, taking him to headquarters.  Ten days later my friend learned that this prisoner had been shot, and the only reason given was that he had refused to give certain desired information as to the enemy.  I have heard an officer tell his men repeatedly to take no prisoners, to kill them even if they came in unarmed, and I have been told by the men themselves of many cases when this was done.  I saw a disarmed Bolshevik prisoner, who was making no attempt to escape and no trouble of any kind, and who was alone in charge of three armed soldiers, shot down in cold blood.  The official whitewash on this case was that he was trying to escape.  I have heard of many other cases of the shooting of Bolshevik prisoners. At one time this had become so common that the Officer Commanding troops issued and had posted up an order forbidding it and calling attention to the fact that there were many Bolshevik soldiers who wanted to come over and give themselves up but feared to do so because they had heard about our shooting prisoners, and warning our men that the Bolsheviki might retaliate by shooting our men whom they held as prisoners.  I have seen at various times many prisoners brought in, but I have never yet seen one that was not robbed. The plunder belonged to the captor or the robber.  We got as high as three thousand roubles off of some of them.  Their boots and belt buckles were especially prized trophies.  I have known cases where the captor was generous and left the prisoner some small thing, but it was only to have some other soldier take it away from him later.  We used gas shells on the Bolsheviki, but that I understand is no longer an atrocity.  We fixed all the"]]]
