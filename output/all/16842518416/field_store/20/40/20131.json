And yet I cry in anguish, as I hear       The long drawn pageant of your passage roll       Magnificently forth into the night.    To yon fair land ye come from, to yon sphere    Of strength and love where now ye shape your flight,       O even wings of music, bear my soul!     Ye have the power, if but ye had the will,       Strong-smitten steady chords in sequence grand,       To bear me forth into that tranquil land    Where good is no more ravelled up with ill;    Where she and I, remote upon some hill       Or by some quiet river’s windless strand,       May live, and love, and wander hand in hand,    And follow nature simply, and be still.     From this grim world, where, sadly, prisoned, we       Sit bound with others’ heart-strings as with chains,       And, if one moves, all suffer,—to that Goal,    If such a land, if such a sphere, there be,       Thither, from life and all life’s joys and pains,       O even wings of music, bear my soul!     FEAR NOT, DEAR FRIEND, BUT FREELY LIVE YOUR DAYS      FEAR not, dear friend, but freely live your days       Though lesser lives should suffer.  Such am I,       A lesser life, that what is his of sky    Gladly would give for you, and what of praise.    Step, without trouble, down the sunlit ways.       We that have touched your raiment, are made whole       From all the selfish cankers of man’s soul,    And we would see you happy, dear, or die.    Therefore be brave, and therefore, dear, be free;    Try all things resolutely, till the best,    Out of all lesser betters, you shall find;    And we, who have learned greatness from you, we,       Your lovers, with a still, contented mind,       See you well anchored in some port of rest.     LET LOVE GO, IF GO SHE WILL      LET love go, if go she will.       Seek not, O fool, her wanton flight to stay.       Of all she gives and takes away    The best remains behind her still.     The best remains behind; in vain    Joy she may give and take again,    Joy she may take and leave us pain,       If yet she leave behind       The constant mind    To meet all fortunes nobly, to endure    All things with a good heart, and still be pure,    Still to be foremost in the foremost cause,    And still be worthy of the love that was.    Love coming is omnipotent indeed,    But not Love going.  Let her go.  The seed    Springs in the favouring Summer air, and grows,    And waxes strong; and when the Summer goes,       Remains, a perfect tree.     Joy she may give and take again,    Joy she may take and leave us pain.       O Love, and what care we?    For one thing thou hast given, O Love, one thing       Is ours that nothing can remove;    And as the King discrowned is still a King,       The unhappy lover still preserves his love.     I DO NOT FEAR TO OWN ME KIN      I DO not fear to own me kin    To the glad clods in which spring flowers begin;    Or to my brothers, the great trees,    That speak with pleasant voices in the breeze,    Loud talkers with the winds that pass;    Or to my sister, the deep grass.     Of such I am, of such my body is,    That thrills to reach its lips to kiss.    That gives and takes with wind and sun and rain    And feels keen pleasure to the point of pain.     Of such are these,    The brotherhood of stalwart trees,    The humble family of flowers,    That make a light of shadowy bowers    Or star the edges of the bent:    They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent;    They joy to shed themselves abroad;    And tree and flower and grass and sod    Thrill and leap and live and sing    With silent voices in the Spring.     Hence I not fear to yield my breath,    Since all is still unchanged by death;    Since in some pleasant valley I may be,    Clod beside clod, or tree by tree,    Long ages hence, with her I love this hour;    And feel a lively joy to share    With her the sun and rain and air,    To taste her quiet neighbourhood    As the dumb things of field and wood,    The clod, the tree, and starry flower,    Alone of all things have the power.     I AM LIKE ONE THAT FOR LONG DAYS HAD SATE      I AM like one that for long days had sate,       With seaward eyes set keen against the gale,       On some lone foreland, watching sail by sail,    The portbound ships for one ship that was late;    And sail by sail, his heart burned up with joy,       And cruelly was quenched, until at last       One ship, the looked-for pennant at its mast,    Bore gaily, and dropt safely past the buoy;    And lo! the loved one was not there—was dead.    Then would he watch no more; no more the sea       With myriad vessels, sail by sail, perplex    His eyes and mock his longing.  Weary head,    Take now thy rest; eyes, close; for no more me       Shall hopes untried elate, or ruined vex.     For thus on love I waited; thus for love       Strained all my senses eagerly and long;       Thus for her coming ever trimmed my song;    Till in the far skies coloured as a dove,    A bird gold-coloured flickered far and fled       Over the pathless waterwaste for me;       And with spread hands I watched the bright bird flee    And waited, till before me she dropped dead.       O golden bird in these dove-coloured skies       How long I sought, how long with wearied eyes    I sought, O bird, the promise of thy flight!       And now the morn has dawned, the morn has died,    The day has come and gone; and once more night       About my lone life settles, wild and wide.     VOLUNTARY      HERE in the quiet eve    My thankful eyes receive          The quiet light.    I see the trees stand fair    Against the faded air,    And star by star prepare          The perfect night.     And in my bosom, lo!    Content and quiet grow          Toward perfect peace.    And now when day is done,    Brief day of wind and sun,    The pure stars, one by one,          Their troop increase.     Keen pleasure and keen grief    Give place to great relief:          Farewell my tears!    Still sounds toward me float;    I hear the bird’s small note,    Sheep from the far sheepcote,          And lowing steers.     For lo! the war is done,    Lo, now the battle won,          The trumpets still.    The shepherd’s slender strain,    The country sounds again    Awake in wood and plain,          On haugh and hill.     Loud wars and loud loves cease.    I welcome my release;          And hail once more    Free foot and way world-wide.    And oft at eventide    Light love to talk beside          The hostel door.     ON NOW, ALTHOUGH THE YEAR BE DONE      ON now, although the year be done,       Now, although the love be dead,          Dead and gone;    Hear me, O loved and cherished one,       Give me still the hand that led,          Led me on.     IN THE GREEN AND GALLANT SPRING      IN the green and gallant Spring,    Love and the lyre I thought to sing,    And kisses sweet to give and take    By the flowery hawthorn brake.     Now is russet Autumn here,    Death and the grave and winter drear,    And I must ponder here aloof    While the rain is on the roof.     DEATH, TO THE DEAD FOR EVERMORE      DEATH, to the dead for evermore    A King, a God, the last, the best of friends—    Whene’er this mortal journey ends    Death, like a host, comes smiling to the door;    Smiling, he greets us, on that tranquil shore    Where neither piping bird nor peeping dawn    Disturbs the eternal sleep,    But in the stillness far withdrawn    Our dreamless rest for evermore we keep.     For as from open windows forth we peep    Upon the night-time star beset    And with dews for ever wet;    So from this garish life the spirit peers;    And lo! as a sleeping city death outspread,    Where breathe the sleepers evenly; and lo!    After the loud wars, triumphs, trumpets, tears    And clamour of man’s passion, Death appears,    And we must rise and go.     Soon are eyes tired with sunshine; soon the ears    Weary of utterance, seeing all is said;    Soon, racked by hopes and fears,    The all-pondering, all-contriving head,    Weary with all things, wearies of the years;    And our sad spirits turn toward the dead;    And the tired child, the body, longs for bed.     TO CHARLES BAXTER   _On the death of their common friend_, _Mr. John Adam_, _Clerk of court_.     OUR Johnie’s deid.  The mair’s the pity!    He’s deid, an’ deid o’ Aqua-vitæ.    O Embro’, you’re a shrunken city,          Noo Johnie’s deid!    Tak hands, an’ sing a burial ditty          Ower Johnie’s heid.

To be aye tosh was Johnie’s whim,    There’s nane was better teut than him,    Though whiles his gravit-knot wad clim’          Ahint his ear,    An’ whiles he’d buttons oot or in          The less ae mair.     His hair a’ lang about his bree,    His tap-lip lang by inches three—    A slockened sort ‘mon,’ to pree          A’ sensuality—    A droutly glint was in his e’e          An’ personality.     An’ day an’ nicht, frae daw to daw,    Dink an’ perjink an’ doucely braw,    Wi’ a kind o’ Gospel ower a’,          May or October,    Like Peden, followin’ the Law          An’ no that sober.     Whusky an’ he were pack thegether.    Whate’er the hour, whate’er the weather,    John kept himsel’ wi’ mistened leather          An’ kindled spunk.    Wi’ him, there was nae askin’ whether—          John was aye drunk.     The auncient heroes gash an’ bauld    In the uncanny days of auld,    The task ance fo(u)nd to which th’were called,          Stack stenchly to it.    His life sic noble lives recalled,          Little’s he knew it.     Single an’ straucht, he went his way.    He kept the faith an’ played the play.    Whusky an’ he were man an’ may          Whate’er betided.    Bonny in life—in death—this twae          Were no’ divided.

I WHO ALL THE WINTER THROUGH            I WHO all the winter through          Cherished other loves than you,    And kept hands with hoary policy in marriage-bed and pew;          Now I know the false and true,          For the earnest sun looks through,    And my old love comes to meet me in the dawning and the dew.           Now the hedged meads renew          Rustic odour, smiling hue,    And the clean air shines and tinkles as the world goes wheeling    through;          And my heart springs up anew,          Bright and confident and true,    And my old love comes to meet me in the dawning and the dew.     LOVE, WHAT IS LOVE?      LOVE—what is love?  A great and aching heart;    Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.    Life—what is life?  Upon a moorland bare    To see love coming and see love depart.     SOON OUR FRIENDS PERISH            SOON our friends perish,          Soon all we cherish    Fades as days darken—goes as flowers go.          Soon in December          Over an ember,    Lonely we hearken, as loud winds blow.     AS ONE WHO HAVING WANDERED ALL NIGHT LONG      AS one who having wandered all night long       In a perplexed forest, comes at length    In the first hours, about the matin song,       And when the sun uprises in his strength,    To the fringed margin of the wood, and sees,       Gazing afar before him, many a mile    Of falling country, many fields and trees,       And cities and bright streams and far-off Ocean’s smile:     I, O Melampus, halting, stand at gaze:       I, liberated, look abroad on life,    Love, and distress, and dusty travelling ways,       The steersman’s helm, the surgeon’s helpful knife,    On the lone ploughman’s earth-upturning share,       The revelry of cities and the sound    Of seas, and mountain-tops aloof in air,       And of the circling earth the unsupported round:     I, looking, wonder: I, intent, adore;       And, O Melampus, reaching forth my hands    In adoration, cry aloud and soar       In spirit, high above the supine lands    And the low caves of mortal things, and flee       To the last fields of the universe untrod,    Where is no man, nor any earth, nor sea,       And the contented soul is all alone with God.     STRANGE ARE THE WAYS OF MEN      STRANGE are the ways of men,       And strange the ways of God!    We tread the mazy paths       That all our fathers trod.     We tread them undismayed,       And undismayed behold    The portents of the sky,       The things that were of old.     The fiery stars pursue       Their course in heav’n on high;    And round the ‘leaguered town,       Crest-tossing heroes cry.     Crest-tossing heroes cry;       And martial fifes declare    How small, to mortal minds,       Is merely mortal care.     And to the clang of steel       And cry of piercing flute    Upon the azure peaks       A God shall plant his foot:     A God in arms shall stand,       And seeing wide and far    The green and golden earth,       The killing tide of war,     He, with uplifted arm,       Shall to the skies proclaim    The gleeful fate of man,       The noble road to fame!     THE WIND BLEW SHRILL AND SMART            THE wind blew shrill and smart,          And the wind awoke my heart    Again to go a-sailing o’er the sea,          To hear the cordage moan          And the straining timbers groan,    And to see the flying pennon lie a-lee.           O sailor of the fleet,          It is time to stir the feet!    It’s time to man the dingy and to row!          It’s lay your hand in mine          And it’s empty down the wine,    And it’s drain a health to death before we go!           To death, my lads, we sail;          And it’s death that blows the gale    And death that holds the tiller as we ride.          For he’s the king of all          In the tempest and the squall,    And the ruler of the Ocean wild and wide!     MAN SAILS THE DEEP AWHILE      MAN sails the deep awhile;          Loud runs the roaring tide;          The seas are wild and wide;    O’er many a salt, o’er many a desert mile,          The unchained breakers ride,          The quivering stars beguile.     Hope bears the sole command;          Hope, with unshaken eyes,          Sees flaw and storm arise;    Hope, the good steersman, with unwearying hand,          Steers, under changing skies,          Unchanged toward the land.     O wind that bravely blows!          O hope that sails with all          Where stars and voices call!    O ship undaunted that forever goes          Where God, her admiral,          His battle signal shows!     What though the seas and wind          Far on the deep should whelm          Colours and sails and helm?    There, too, you touch that port that you designed—          There, in the mid-seas’ realm,          Shall you that haven find.     Well hast thou sailed: now die,          To die is not to sleep.          Still your true course you keep,    O sailor soul, still sailing for the sky;          And fifty fathom deep          Your colours still shall fly.     THE COCK’S CLEAR VOICE INTO THE CLEARER AIR      THE cock’s clear voice into the clearer air       Where westward far I roam,    Mounts with a thrill of hope,       Falls with a sigh of home.     A rural sentry, he from farm and field       The coming morn descries,    And, mankind’s bugler, wakes       The camp of enterprise.     He sings the morn upon the westward hills       Strange and remote and wild;    He sings it in the land       Where once I was a child.     He brings to me dear voices of the past,       The old land and the years:    My father calls for me,       My weeping spirit hears.     Fife, fife, into the golden air, O bird,       And sing the morning in;    For the old days are past       And new days begin.     NOW WHEN THE NUMBER OF MY YEARS      NOW when the number of my years       Is all fulfilled, and I       From sedentary life       Shall rouse me up to die,          Bury me low and let me lie          Under the wide and starry sky.          Joying to live, I joyed to die,          Bury me low and let me lie.     Clear was my soul, my deeds were free,       Honour was called my name,       I fell not back from fear       Nor followed after fame.          Bury me low and let me lie          Under the wide and starry sky.          Joying to live, I joyed to die,          Bury me low and let me lie.     Bury me low in valleys green       And where the milder breeze       Blows fresh along the stream,       Sings roundly in the trees—          Bury me low and let me lie          Under the wide and starry sky.          Joying to live, I joyed to die,          Bury me low and let me lie.     WHAT MAN MAY LEARN, WHAT MAN MAY DO      WHAT man may learn, what man may do,    Of right or wrong of false or true,    While, skipper-like, his course he steers    Through nine and twenty mingled years,    Half misconceived and half forgot,    So much I know and practise not.     Old are the words of wisdom, old    The counsels of the wise and bold:    To close the ears, to check the tongue,    To keep the pining spirit young;    To act the right, to say the true,    And to be kind whate’er you do.     Thus we across the modern stage    Follow the wise of every age;    And, as oaks grow and rivers run    Unchanged in the unchanging sun,    So the eternal march of man    Goes forth on an eternal plan.     SMALL IS THE TRUST WHEN LOVE IS GREEN      SMALL is the trust when love is green       In sap of early years;    A little thing steps in between       And kisses turn to tears.     Awhile—and see how love be grown       In loveliness and power!    Awhile, it loves the sweets alone,       But next it loves the sour.     A little love is none at all       That wanders or that fears;    A hearty love dwells still at call       To kisses or to tears.     Such then be mine, my love to give,       And such be yours to take:—    A faith to hold, a life to live,       For lovingkindness’ sake:     Should you be sad, should you be gay,       Or should you prove unkind,    A love to hold the growing way       And keep the helping mind:—     A love to turn the laugh on care       When wrinkled care appears,    And, with an equal will, to share       Your losses and your tears.     KNOW YOU THE RIVER NEAR TO GREZ      KNOW you the river near to Grez,       A river deep and clear?    Among the lilies all the way,    That ancient river runs to-day       From snowy weir to weir.     Old as the Rhine of great renown,       She hurries clear and fast,    She runs amain by field and town    From south to north, from up to down,       To present on from past.     The love I hold was borne by her;       And now, though far away,    My lonely spirit hears the stir    Of water round the starling spur       Beside the bridge at Grez.     So may that love forever hold       In life an equal pace;    So may that love grow never old,    But, clear and pure and fountain-cold,       Go on from grace to "]]]
