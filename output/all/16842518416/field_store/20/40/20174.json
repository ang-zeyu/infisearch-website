WILFRID COMES FORWARD XXIII.    FIRST HOURS OF THE FLIGHT XXIV.     ADVENTURES OF VITTORIA AND ANGELO XXV.      ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS    CHAPTER XX  THE OPERA OF CAMILLA  She was dressed like a noble damsel from the hands of Titian.  An Italian audience cannot but be critical in their first glance at a prima donna, for they are asked to do homage to a queen who is to be taken on her merits: all that they have heard and have been taught to expect of her is compared swiftly with the observation of her appearance and her manner. She is crucially examined to discover defects.  There is no boisterous loyalty at the outset.  And as it was now evident that Vittoria had chosen to impersonate a significant character, her indications of method were jealously watched for a sign of inequality, either in her, motion, or the force of her eyes.  So silent a reception might have seemed cruel in any other case; though in all cases the candidate for laurels must, in common with the criminal, go through the ordeal of justification.  Men do not heartily bow their heads until they have subjected the aspirant to some personal contest, and find themselves overmatched.  The senses, ready to become so slavish in adulation and delight, are at the beginning more exacting than the judgement, more imperious than the will.  A figure in amber and pale blue silk was seen, such as the great Venetian might have sketched from his windows on a day when the Doge went forth to wed the Adriatic a superb Italian head, with dark banded hair-braid, and dark strong eyes under unabashed soft eyelids!  She moved as, after long gazing at a painting of a fair woman, we may have the vision of her moving from the frame.  It was an animated picture of ideal Italia. The sea of heads right up to the highest walls fronted her glistening, and she was mute as moonrise.  A virgin who loosens a dove from her bosom does it with no greater effort than Vittoria gave out her voice.  The white bird flutters rapidly; it circles and takes its flight.  The voice seemed to be as little the singer's own.  The theme was as follows:--Camilla has dreamed overnight that her lost mother came to her bedside to bless her nuptials.  Her mother was folded in a black shroud, looking formless as death, like very death, save that death sheds no tears.  She wept, without change of voice, or mortal shuddering, like one whose nature weeps: 'And with the forth-flowing of her tears the knowledge of her features was revealed to me.'  Behold the Adige, the Mincio, Tiber, and the Po!--such great rivers were the tears pouring from her eyes.  She threw apart the shroud: her breasts and her limbs were smooth and firm as those of an immortal Goddess: but breasts and limbs showed the cruel handwriting of base men upon the body of a martyred saint.  The blood from those deep gashes sprang out at intervals, mingling with her tears.  She said:  'My child!  were I a Goddess, my wounds would heal.  Were I a Saint, I should be in Paradise.  I am no Goddess, and no Saint: yet I cannot die. My wounds flow and my tears.  My tears flow because of no fleshly anguish: I pardon my enemies.  My blood flows from my body, my tears from my soul.  They flow to wash out my shame.  I have to expiate my soul's shame by my body's shame.  Oh! how shall I tell you what it is to walk among my children unknown of them, though each day I bear the sun abroad like my beating heart; each night the moon, like a heart with no blood in it.  Sun and moon they see, but not me!  They know not their mother.  I cry to God.  The answer of our God is this:--\"Give to thy children one by one to drink of thy mingled tears and blood:--then, if there is virtue in them, they shall revive, thou shaft revive.  If virtue is not in them, they and thou shall continue prostrate, and the ox shall walk over you.\" From heaven's high altar, O Camilla, my child, this silver sacramental cup was reached to me.  Gather my tears in it, fill it with my blood, and drink.'  The song had been massive in monotones, almost Gregorian in its severity up to this point.  'I took the cup.  I looked my mother in the face.  I filled the cup from the flowing of her tears, the flowing of her blood; and I drank!'  Vittoria sent this last phrase ringing out forcefully.  From the inveterate contralto of the interview, she rose to pure soprano in describing her own action.  'And I drank,' was given on a descent of the voice: the last note was in the minor key--it held the ear as if more must follow: like a wail after a triumph of resolve.  It was a masterpiece of audacious dramatic musical genius addressed with sagacious cunning and courage to the sympathizing audience present.  The supposed incompleteness kept them listening; the intentness sent that last falling (as it were, broken) note travelling awakeningly through their minds. It is the effect of the minor key to stir the hearts of men with this particular suggestiveness.  The house rose, Italians--and Germans together.  Genius, music, and enthusiasm break the line of nationalities. A rain of nosegays fell about Vittoria; evvivas, bravas, shouts--all the outcries of delirious men surrounded her.  Men and women, even among the hardened chorus, shook together and sobbed.  'Agostino!' and 'Rocco!' were called; 'Vittoria!' 'Vittoria!' above all, with increasing thunder, like a storm rushing down a valley, striking in broad volume from rock to rock, humming remote, and bursting up again in the face of the vale.  Her name was sung over and over--'Vittoria!  Vittoria!' as if the mouths were enamoured of it.  'Evviva la Vittoria a d' Italia!' was sung out from the body of the house.  An echo replied--  '\"Italia a il premio della VITTORIA!\"' a well-known saying gloriously adapted, gloriously rescued from disgrace.  But the object and source of the tremendous frenzy stood like one frozen by the revelation of the magic the secret of which she has studiously mastered.  A nosegay, the last of the tributary shower, discharged from a distance, fell at her feet.  She gave it unconsciously preference over the rest, and picked it up.  A little paper was fixed in the centre.  She opened it with a mechanical hand, thinking there might be patriotic orders enclosed for her.  It was a cheque for one thousand guineas, drawn upon an English banker by the hand of Antonio-Pericles Agriolopoulos; freshly drawn; the ink was only half dried, showing signs of the dictates of a furious impulse.  This dash of solid prose, and its convincing proof that her Art had been successful, restored Vittoria's composure, though not her early statuesque simplicity.  Rocco gave an inquiring look to see if she would repeat the song.  She shook her head resolutely.  Her opening of the paper in the bouquet had quieted the general ebullition, and the expression of her wish being seen, the chorus was permitted to usurp her place.  Agostino paced up and down the lobby, fearful that he had been guilty of leading her to anticlimax.  He met Antonio-Pericles, and told him so; adding (for now the mask had been seen through, and was useless any further) that he had not had the heart to put back that vision of Camilla's mother to a later scene, lest an interruption should come which would altogether preclude its being heard.  Pericles affected disdain of any success which Vittoria had yet achieved.  'Wait for Act the Third,' he said; but his irritable anxiousness to hold intercourse with every one, patriot or critic, German, English, or Italian, betrayed what agitation of exultation coursed in his veins.  'Aha!' was his commencement of a greeting; 'was Antonio-Pericles wrong when he told you that he had a prima donna for you to amaze all Christendom, and whose notes were safe and firm as the footing of the angels up and down Jacob's ladder, my friends?  Aha!'  'Do you see that your uncle is signalling to you?' Countess Lena said to Wilfrid.  He answered like a man in a mist, and looked neither at her nor at the General, who, in default of his obedience to gestures, came good- humouredly to the box, bringing Captain Weisspriess with him.  'We 're assisting at a pretty show,' he said.  'I am in love with her voice,' said Countess Anna.  'Ay; if it were only a matter of voices, countess.'  'I think that these good people require a trouncing,' said Captain Weisspriess.  'Lieutenant Pierson is not of your opinion,' Countess Anna remarked. Hearing his own name, Wilfrid turned to them with a weariness well acted, but insufficiently to a jealous observation, for his eyes were quick under the carelessly-dropped eyelids, and ranged keenly over the stage while they were affecting to assist his fluent tongue.  Countess Lena levelled her opera-glass at Carlo Ammiani, and then placed the glass in her sister's hand.  Wilfrid drank deep of bitterness.  'That is Vittoria's lover,' he thought; 'the lover of the Emilia who once loved me!'  General Pierson may have noticed this by-play: he said to his nephew in the brief military tone: 'Go out; see that the whole regiment is handy about the house; station a dozen men, with a serjeant, at each of the backdoors, and remain below.  I very much mistake, or we shall have to make a capture of this little woman to-night.'  'How on earth,' he resumed, while Wilfrid rose savagely and went out with his stiffest bow, 'this opera was permitted to appear, I can't guess!  A child could see through it.  The stupidity of our civil authorities passes my understanding--it's a miracle!  We have stringent orders not to take any initiative, or I would stop the Fraulein Camilla from uttering another note.'  'If you did that, I should be angry with you, General,' said Countess Anna.  'And I also think the Government cannot do wrong,' Countess Lena joined in.  The General contented himself by saying: 'Well, we shall see.'  Countess Lena talked to Captain Weisspriess in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4438"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 4 (#1)"],["body","undertone, referring to what she called his dispute with Carlo Ammiani.  The captain was extremely playful in rejoinders.  'You iron man!' she exclaimed.  'Man of steel would be the better phrase,' her sister whispered.  'It will be an assassination, if it happens.'  'No officer can bear with an open insult, Lena.'  'I shall not sit and see harm done to my old playmate, Anna.'  'Beware of betraying yourself for one who detests you.'  A grand duo between Montini and Vittoria silenced all converse.  Camilla tells Camillo of her dream.  He pledges his oath to discover her mother, if alive; if dead, to avenge her.  Camilla says she believes her mother is in the dungeons of Count Orso's castle.  The duo tasked Vittoria's execution of florid passages; it gave evidence of her sound artistic powers.  'I was a fool,' thought Antonio-Pericles; 'I flung my bouquet with the herd.  I was a fool!  I lost my head!'  He tapped angrily at the little ink-flask in his coat-pocket.  The first act, after scenes between false Camillo and Michiella, ends with the marriage of Camillo and Camilla;--a quatuor composed of Montini, Vittoria, Irma, and Lebruno.  Michiella is in despair; Count Orso is profoundly sonorous with paternity and devotion to the law.  He has restored to Camilla a portion of her mother's sequestrated estates. A portion of the remainder will be handed over to her when he has had experience of her husband's good behaviour.  The rest he considers legally his own by right of (Treaties), and by right of possession and documents his sword.  Yonder castle he must keep.  It is the key of all his other territories.  Without it, his position will be insecure. (Allusion to the Austrian argument that the plains of Lombardy are the strategic defensive lines of the Alps.)  Agostino, pursued by his terror of anticlimax, ran from the sight of Vittoria when she was called, after the fall of the curtain.  He made his way to Rocco Ricci (who had given his bow to the public from his perch), and found the maestro drinking Asti to counteract his natural excitement. Rocco told Agostino, that up to the last moment, neither he nor any soul behind the scenes knew Vittoria would be able to appear, except that she had sent a note to him with a pledge to be in readiness for the call. Irma had come flying in late, enraged, and in disorder, praying to take Camilla's part; but Montini refused to act with the seconda donna as prima donna.  They had commenced the opera in uncertainty whether it could go on beyond the situation where Camilla presents herself.  'I was prepared to throw up my baton,' said Rocco, 'and publicly to charge the Government with the rape of our prima donna.  Irma I was ready to replace.  I could have filled that gap.' He spoke of Vittoria's triumph. Agostino's face darkened.  'Ha!' said he, 'provided we don't fall flat, like your Asti with the cork out.  I should have preferred an enthusiasm a trifle more progressive.  The notion of travelling backwards is upon me forcibly, after that tempest of acclamation.'  'Or do you think that you have put your best poetry in the first Act?' Rocco suggested with malice.  'Not a bit of it!' Agostino repudiated the idea very angrily, and puffed and puffed.  Yet he said, 'I should not be lamenting if the opera were stopped at once.'  'No!' cried Rocco; 'let us have our one night.  I bargain for that. Medole has played us false, but we go on.  We are victims already, my Agostino.'  'But I do stipulate,' said Agostino, 'that my jewel is not to melt herself in the cup to-night.  I must see her.  As it is, she is inevitably down in the list for a week's or a month's incarceration.'  Antonio-Pericles had this, in his case, singular piece of delicacy, that he refrained from the attempt to see Vittoria immediately after he had flung his magnificent bouquet of treasure at her feet.  In his intoxication with the success which he had foreseen and cradled to its apogee, he was now reckless of any consequences.  He felt ready to take patriotic Italy in his arms, provided that it would succeed as Vittoria had done, and on the spot.  Her singing of the severe phrases of the opening chant, or hymn, had turned the man, and for a time had put a new heart in him.  The consolation was his also, that he had rewarded it the most splendidly--as it were, in golden italics of praise; so that her forgiveness of his disinterested endeavour to transplant her was certain, and perhaps her future implicit obedience or allegiance bought.  Meeting General Pierson, the latter rallied him.  'Why, my fine Pericles, your scheme to get this girl out of the way was capitally concerted.  My only fear is that on another occasion the Government will take another view of it and you.'  Pericles shrugged.  'The Gods, my dear General, decree.  I did my best to lay a case before them; that is all.'  'Ah, well!  I am of opinion you will not lay many other cases before the Gods who rule in Milan.'  'I have helped them to a good opera.'  'Are you aware that this opera consists entirely of political allusions?'  General Pierson spoke offensively, as the urbane Austrian military permitted themselves to do upon occasion when addressing the conquered or civilians.  'To me,' returned Pericles, 'an opera--it is music.  I know no more.'  'You are responsible for it,' said the General, harshly.  'It was taken upon trust from you.'  'Brutal Austrians!' Pericles murmured.  'And you do not think much of her voice, General?'  'Pretty fair, sir.'  'What wonder she does not care to open her throat to these swine!' thought the changed Greek.  Vittoria's door was shut to Agostino.  No voice within gave answer.  He tried the lock of the door, and departed.  She sat in a stupor.  It was harder for her to make a second appearance than it was to make the first, when the shameful suspicion cruelly attached to her had helped to balance her steps with rebellious pride; and more, the great collected wave of her ambitious years of girlhood had cast her forward to the spot, as in a last effort for consummation.  Now that she had won the public voice (love, her heart called it) her eyes looked inward; she meditated upon what she had to do, and coughed nervously.  She frightened herself with her coughing, and shivered at the prospect of again going forward in the great nakedness of stagelights and thirsting eyes.  And, moreover, she was not strengthened by the character of the music and the poetry of the second Act:--a knowledge of its somewhat inferior quality may possibly have been at the root of Agostino's dread of an anticlimax.  The seconda donna had the chief part in it--notably an aria (Rocco had given it to her in compassion) that suited Irma's pure shrieks and the tragic skeleton she could be.  Vittoria knew how low she was sinking when she found her soul in the shallows of a sort of jealousy of Irma.  For a little space she lost all intimacy with herself; she looked at her face in the glass and swallowed water, thinking that she had strained a dream and confused her brain with it.  The silence of her solitary room coming upon the blaze of light the colour and clamour of the house, and the strange remembrance of the recent impersonation of an ideal character, smote her with the sense of her having fallen from a mighty eminence, and that she lay in the dust.  All those incense-breathing flowers heaped on her table seemed poisonous, and reproached her as a delusion.  She sat crouching alone till her tirewomen called; horrible talkative things! her own familiar maid Giacinta being the worst to bear with.  Now, Michiella, by making love to Leonardo, Camillo's associate, discovers that Camillo is conspiring against her father.  She utters to Leonardo very pleasant promises indeed, if he will betray his friend. Leonardo, a wavering baritono, complains that love should ask for any return save in the coin of the empire of love.  He is seduced, and invokes a malediction upon his head should he accomplish what he has sworn to perform.  Camilla reposes perfect confidence in this wretch, and brings her more doubtful husband to be of her mind.  Camillo and Camilla agree to wear the mask of a dissipated couple. They throw their mansion open; dicing, betting, intriguing, revellings, maskings, commence.  Michiella is courted ardently by Camillo; Camilla trifles with Leonardo and with Count Orso alternately.  Jealous again of Camilla, Michiella warns and threatens Leonardo; but she becomes Camillo's dupe, partly from returning love, partly from desire for vengeance on her rival.  Camilla persuades Orso to discard Michiella. The infatuated count waxes as the personification of portentous burlesque; he is having everything his own way.  The acting throughout-- owing to the real gravity of the vast basso Lebruno's burlesque, and Vittoria's archness--was that of high comedy with a lurid background. Vittoria showed an enchanting spirit of humour.  She sang one bewitching barcarole that set the house in rocking motion.  There was such melancholy in her heart that she cast herself into all the flippancy with abandonment.  The Act was weak in too distinctly revealing the finger of the poetic political squib at a point here and there.  The temptation to do it of an Agostino, who had no other outlet, had been irresistible, and he sat moaning over his artistic depravity, now that it stared him in the face.  Applause scarcely consoled him, and it was with humiliation of mind that he acknowledged his debt to the music and the singers, and how little they owed to him.  Now Camillo is pleased to receive the ardent passion of his wife, and the masking suits his taste, but it is the vice of his character that he cannot act to any degree subordinately in concert; he insists upon positive headship!--(allusion to an Italian weakness for sovereignties; it passed unobserved, and chuckled bitterly over his excess of subtlety). Camillo cannot leave the scheming to her.  He pursues Michiella "]]]
