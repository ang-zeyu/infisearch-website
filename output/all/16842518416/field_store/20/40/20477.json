Thirdly, even if it were possible to distinguish the wicked from the good unfailingly, even then it would be impossible to kill or injure or shut up in prison these wicked men, because there would be no one in a Christian society to carry out such punishment, since every Christian, as a Christian, has been commanded to use no force against the wicked.  The third kind of answer, still more subtle than the preceding, consists in asserting that though the command of non-resistance to evil by force is binding on the Christian when the evil is directed against himself personally, it ceases to be binding when the evil is directed against his neighbors, and that then the Christian is not only not bound to fulfill the commandment, but is even bound to act in opposition to it in defense of his neighbors, and to use force against transgressors by force.  This assertion is an absolute assumption, and one cannot find in all Christ's teaching any confirmation of such an argument.  Such an argument is not only a limitation, but a direct contradiction and negation of the commandment.  If every man has the right to have recourse to force in face of a danger threatening an other, the question of the use of force is reduced to a question of the definition of danger for another.  If my private judgment is to decide the question of what is danger for another, there is no occasion for the use of force which could not be justified on the ground of danger threatening some other man.  They killed and burnt witches, they killed aristocrats and girondists, they killed their enemies because those who were in authority regarded them as dangerous for the people.  If this important limitation, which fundamentally undermines the whole value of the commandment, had entered into Christ's meaning, there must have been mention of it somewhere.  This restriction is made nowhere in our Saviour's life or preaching.  On the contrary, warning is given precisely against this treacherous and scandalous restriction which nullifies the commandment.  The error and impossibility of such a limitation is shown in the Gospel with special clearness in the account of the judgment of Caiaphas, who makes precisely this distinction.  He acknowledged that it was wrong to punish the innocent Jesus, but he saw in him a source of danger not for himself, but for the whole people, and therefore he said: It is better for one man to die, that the whole people perish not.  And the erroneousness of such a limitation is still more clearly expressed in the words spoken to Peter when he tried to resist by force evil directed against Jesus (Matt. xxvi. 52). Peter was not defending himself, but his beloved and heavenly Master.  And Christ at once reproved him for this, saying, that he who takes up the sword shall perish by the sword.  Besides, apologies for violence used against one's neighbor in defense of another neighbor from greater violence are always untrustworthy, because when force is used against one who has not yet carried out his evil intent, I can never know which would be greater--the evil of my act of violence or of the act I want to prevent. We kill the criminal that society may be rid of him, and we never know whether the criminal of to-day would not have been a changed man tomorrow, and whether our punishment of him is not useless cruelty. We shut up the dangerous--as we think--member of society, but the next day this man might cease to be dangerous and his imprisonment might be for nothing. I see that a man I know to be a ruffian is pursuing a young girl. I have a gun in my hand--I kill the ruffian and save the girl. But the death or the wounding of the ruffian has positively taken place, while what would have happened if this had not been I cannot know. And what an immense mass of evil must result, and indeed does result, from allowing men to assume the right of anticipating what may happen. Ninety-nine per cent of the evil of the world is founded on this reasoning--from the Inquisition to dynamite bombs, and the executions or punishments of tens of thousands of political criminals.  A fourth, still more refined, reply to the question, What ought to be the Christian's attitude to Christ's command of non-resistance to evil by force? consists in declaring that they do not deny the command of non-resisting evil, but recognize it; but they only do not ascribe to this command the special exclusive value attached to it by sectarians.  To regard this command as the indispensable condition of Christian life, as Garrison, Ballou, Dymond, the Quakers, the Mennonites and the Shakers do now, and as the Moravian brothers, the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the Bogomilites, and the Paulicians did in the past, is a one-sided heresy.  This command has neither more nor less value than all the other commands, and the man who through weakness transgresses any command whatever, the command of non-resistance included, does not cease to be a Christian if he hold the true faith.  This is a very skillful device, and many people who wish to be deceived are easily deceived by it.  The device consists in reducing a direct conscious denial of a command to a casual breach of it.  But one need only compare the attitude of the teachers of the Church to this and to other commands which they really do recognize, to be convinced that their attitude to this is completely different from their attitude to other duties.  The command against fornication they do really recognize, and consequently they do not admit that in any case fornication can cease to be wrong.  The Church preachers never point out cases in which the command against fornication can be broken, and always teach that we must avoid seductions which lead to temptation to fornication.  But not so with the command of non-resistance.  All church preachers recognize cases in which that command can be broken, and teach the people accordingly.  And they not only do not teach teat we should avoid temptations to break it, chief of which is the military oath, but they themselves administer it. The preachers of the Church never in any other case advocate the breaking of any other commandment.  But in connection with the commandment of non-resistance they openly teach that we must not understand it too literally, but that there are conditions and circumstances in which we must do the direct opposite, that is, go to law, fight, punish.  So that occasions for fulfilling the commandment of non-resistance to evil by force are taught for the most part as occasions for not fulfilling it.  The fulfillment of this command, they say, is very difficult and pertains only to perfection.  And how can it not be difficult, when the breach of it is not only not forbidden, but law courts, prisons, cannons, guns, armies, and wars are under the immediate sanction of the Church?  It cannot be true, then, that this command is recognized by the preachers of the Church as on a level with other commands.  The preachers of the Church clearly, do not recognize it; only not daring to acknowledge this, they try to conceal their not recognizing it.  So much for the fourth reply.  The fifth kind of answer, which is the subtlest, the most often used, and the most effective, consists in avoiding answering, in making believe that this question is one which has long ago been decided perfectly clearly and satisfactorily, and that it is not worth while to talk about it.  This method of reply is employed by all the more or less cultivated religious writers, that is to say, those who feel the laws of Christ binding for themselves.  Knowing that the contradiction existing between the teaching of Christ which we profess with our lips and the whole order of our lives cannot be removed by words, and that touching upon it can only make it more obvious, they, with more or less ingenuity, evade it, pretending that the question of reconciling Christianity with the use of force has been decided already, or does not exist at all.      [Footnote: I only know one work which differs somewhat from     this general definition, and that is not a criticism in the     precise meaning of the word, but an article treating of the     same subject and having my book in view.  I mean the pamphlet     of Mr. Troizky (published at Kazan), \"A Sermon for the     People.\"  The author obviously accepts Christ's teaching in     its true meaning.  He says that the prohibition of resistance     to evil by force means exactly what it does mean; and the same     with the prohibition of swearing.  He does not, as others do,     deny the meaning of Christ's teaching, but unfortunately he     does not draw from this admission the inevitable deductions     which present themselves spontaneously in our life when we     understand Christ's teaching in that way.  If we must not     oppose evil by force, nor swear, everyone naturally asks,     \"How, then, about military service? and the oath of     obedience?\"  To this question the author gives no reply; but     it must be answered.  And if he cannot answer, then he would     do better no to speak on the subject at all, as such silence     leads to error.]  The majority of religious critics of my book use this fifth method of replying to it. I could quote dozens of such critics, in all of whom, without exception, we find the same thing repeated: everything is discussed except what constitutes the principal subject of the book.  As a characteristic example of such criticisms, I will quote the article of a well-known and ingenious English writer and preacher--Farrar--who, like many learned theologians, is a great master of the art of circuitously evading a question.  The article was published in an American journal, the FORUM, in October, 1888.  After conscientiously explaining in brief the contents of my book, Farrar says:     \"Tolstoy came to the conclusion that a coarse deceit had been    palmed upon the world when these words 'Resist"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],["title","\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#8)"],["body"," not evil,' were    held by civil society to be compatible with war, courts of    justice, capital punishment, divorce, oaths, national    prejudice, and, indeed, with most of the institutions of civil    and social life.  He now believes that the kingdom of God would    come if all men kept these five commandments of Christ, viz.:    1. Live in peace with all men.  2. Be pure.  3. Take no oaths.    4. Resist not evil.  5. Renounce national distinctions.     \"Tolstoy,\" he says, \"rejects the inspiration of the Old    Testament; hence he rejects the chief doctrines of the Church--that    of the Atonement by blood, the Trinity, the descent of the    Holy Ghost on the Apostles, and his transmission through the    priesthood.\"  And he recognizes only the words and commands of    Christ.  \"But is this interpretation of Christ a true one?\" he    says.  \"Are all men bound to act as Tolstoy teaches--i. e., to    carry out these five commandments of Christ?\"  You expect, then, that in answer to this essential question, which is the only one that could induce a man to write an article about the book, he will say either that this interpretation of Christ's teaching is true and we ought to follow it, or he will say that such an interpretation is untrue, will show why, and will give some other correct interpretation of those words which I interpret incorrectly.  But nothing of this kind is done.  Farrar only expresses his \"belief\" that,     \"although actuated by the noblest sincerity, Count Tolstoy has    been misled by partial and one-sided interpretations of the    meaning of the Gospel and the mind and will of Christ.\"  What    this error consists in is not made clear; it is only said:    \"To enter into the proof of this is impossible in this article,    for I have already exceeded the space at my command.\"  And he concludes in a tranquil spirit:     \"Meanwhile, the reader who feels troubled lest it should be his    duty also to forsake all the conditions of his life and to take    up the position and work of a common laborer, may rest for the    present on the principle, SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS TERRARUM.  With    few and rare exceptions,\" he continues, \"the whole of    Christendom, from the days of the Apostles down to our own, has    come to the firm conclusion that it was the object of Christ to    lay down great eternal principles, but not to disturb the bases    and revolutionize the institutions of all human society, which    themselves rest on divine sanctions as well as on inevitable    conditions.  Were it my object to prove how untenable is the    doctrine of communism, based by Count Tolstoy upon the divine    paradoxes [sic], which can be interpreted only on historical    principles in accordance with the whole method of the teaching    of Jesus, it would require an ampler canvas than I have here at    my disposal.\"  What a pity he has not an \"ampler canvas at his disposal\"! And what a strange thing it is that for all these last fifteen centuries no one has had a \"canvas ample enough\" to prove that Christ, whom we profess to believe in, says something utterly unlike what he does say! Still, they could prove it if they wanted to. But it is not worth while to prove what everyone knows; it is enough to say \"SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS TERRARUM.\"  And of this kind, without exception, are all the criticisms of educated believers, who must, as such, understand the danger of their position. The sole escape from it for them lies in their hope that they may be able, by using the authority of the Church, of antiquity, and of their sacred office, to overawe the reader and draw him away from the idea of reading the Gospel for himself and thinking out the question in his own mind for himself. And in this they are successful; for, indeed, how could the notion occur to any one that all that has been repeated from century to century with such earnestness and solemnity by all those archdeacons, bishops, archbishops, holy synods, and popes, is all of it a base lie and a calumny foisted upon Christ by them for the sake of keeping safe the money they must have to live luxuriously on the necks of other men? And it is a lie and a calumny so transparent that the only way of keeping it up consists in overawing people by their earnestness, their conscientiousness. It is just what has taken place of late years at recruiting sessions; at a table before the zertzal--the symbol of the Tzars authority--in the seat of honor under the life-size portrait of the Tzar, sit dignified old officials, wearing decorations, conversing freely and easily, writing notes, summoning men before them, and giving orders. Here, wearing a cross on his breast, near them, is prosperous-looking old Priest in a silken cassock, with long gray hair flowing on to his cope; before a lectern who wears the golden cross and has a Gospel bound in gold.  They summon Iran Petroff.  A young man comes in, wretchedly, shabbily dressed, and in terror, the muscles of his face working, his eyes bright and restless; and in a broken voice, hardly above a whisper, he says: \"I--by Christ's law--as a Christian--I cannot.\"  \"What is he muttering?\" asks the president, frowning impatiently and raising his eyes from his book to listen. \"Speak louder,\" the colonel with shining epaulets shouts to him. \"I--I as a Christian--\"  And at last it appears that the young man refuses to serve in the army because he is a Christian.  \"Don't talk nonsense.  Stand to be measured.  Doctor, may I trouble you to measure him.  He is all right?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Reverend father, administer the oath to him.\"  No one is the least disturbed by what the poor scared young man is muttering. They do not even pay attention to it.  \"They all mutter something, but we've no time to listen to it, we have to enroll so many.\"  The recruit tries to say something still.  \"It's opposed to the law of Christ.\"  \"Go along, go along; we know without your help what is opposed to the law and what's not; and you soothe his mind, reverend father, soothe him.  Next: Vassily Nikitin.\"  And they lead the trembling youth away. And it does not strike anyone --the guards, or Vassily Nikitin, whom they are bringing in, or any of the spectators of this scene--that these inarticulate words of the young man, at once suppressed by the authorities, contain the truth, and that the loud, solemnly uttered sentences of the calm, self-confident official and the priest are a lie and a deception.  Such is the impression produced not only by Farrar's article, but by all those solemn sermons, articles, and books which make their appearance from all sides directly there is anywhere a glimpse of truth exposing a predominant falsehood.  At once begins the series of long, clever, ingenious, and solemn speeches and writings, which deal with questions nearly related to the subject, but skillfully avoid touching the subject itself.  That is the essence of the fifth and most effective means of getting out of the contradictions in which Church Christianity has placed itself, by professing its faith in Christ's teaching in words, while it denies it in its life, and teaches people to do the same.  Those who justify themselves by the first method, directly, crudely asserting that Christ sanctioned violence, wars, and murder, repudiate Christ's doctrine directly; those who find their defense in the second, the third, or the fourth method are confused and can easily be convicted of error; but this last class, who do not argue, who do not condescend to argue about it, but take shelter behind their own grandeur, and make a show of all this having been decided by them or at least by someone long ago, and no longer offering a possibility of doubt to anyone--they seem safe from attack, and will be beyond attack till men come to realize that they are under the narcotic influence exerted on them by governments and churches, and are no longer affected by it.  Such was the attitude of the spiritual critics--i. e., those professing faith in Christ--to my book.  And their attitude could not have been different.  They are bound to take up this attitude by the contradictory position in which they find themselves between belief in the divinity of their Master and disbelief in his clearest utterances, and they want to escape from this contradiction.  So that one cannot expect from them free discussion of the very essence of the question--that is, of the change in men's life which must result from applying Christ's teaching to the existing order of the world.  Such free discussion I only expected from worldly, freethinking critics who are not bound to Christ's teaching in any way, and can therefore take an independent view of it.  I had anticipated that freethinking writers would look at Christ, not merely, like the Churchmen, as the founder of a religion of personal salvation, but, to express it in their language, as a reformer who laid down new principles of life and destroyed the old, and whose reforms are not yet complete, but are still in progress even now.  Such a view of Christ and his teaching follows from my book. But to my astonishment, out of the great number of critics of my book there was not one, either Russian or foreign, who treated the subject from the side from which it was approached in the book--that is, who criticised Christ's doctrines as philosophical, moral, and social principles, to use their scientific expressions. This was not done in a single criticism. The freethinking Russian critics taking my book as though its whole contents could be reduced to non-resistance to evil, and understanding the doctrine of non-resistance to evil itself (no doubt for greater convenience in refuting it) as though it would prohibit every kind of conflict with evil, fell vehemently upon this doctrine, and for some years past have been very successfully proving that Christ's teaching is mistaken in so far as it forbids resistance to evil. Their refutations of this hypothetical doctrine of"]]]
