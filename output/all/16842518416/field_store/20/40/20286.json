Then, overcome by her breach of the conventions, she ran out of the room and into the arms of her governess.  Frau Krupp would not have had the heart to scold Barbara even if she had not run away.  \"—— him!\"—her own sentiments.  With such reflections she leaned back in her great arm-chair, undecided whether she should follow Bertha to the council room or not.  Her motherly dignity said \"No,\" while anxiety for her child urged her to go to her.  \"To think of him playing the bully in my own house,\" she deliberated; \"the coward, setting a child against her mother!  But I know what it’s done for.  He wants her like wax in his hand—the hand getting ready to choke the world into submission.\"  The butler entered with soft step.  \"Fraulein begs to say that she will leave for Cologne at 10.30 sharp, and she desires your ladyship to get ready.\"  \"Thank you, my maid shall lay out the new black silk costume.  Did you order the horses?\"  \"Fraulein’s secretary is attending to everything,\" said the butler in a hurt voice.  \"I don’t know by what authority he assumes my duties,\" he added.  \"He shall not do so again, Christian,\" promised the Baroness.   Three hours later Frau Krupp and Bertha were going the rounds of Cologne’s most exclusive shops.  The Hochstrasse is too narrow to permit the use of a carriage; the ladies were followed, then, by a train of commissionaires laden with boxes, for Bertha was buying everything in the line of frocks, costumes and millinery that was pretty and expensive.  Consult her mother?  Not a bit of it.  The Court Marshal’s instructions were silk, velvet, laces; nothing else mattered.  The shopkeepers, of course, knew Frau Krupp; they had known Bertha familiarly ever since she was in short frocks.  The girl of seventeen had blossomed into the richest heiress of the world, yet it would have been almost indecent not to consider the elder woman first.  So the best chair was pushed forward for the Baroness, and man-milliners and _mannequins_ fell over each other trying to win her applause for the goods offered.  The widow of the Ironmaster smiled and talked vaguely about their merits, but announced that Bertha was to do her own choosing.  Bertha went about her task like an inexperienced country lass suddenly fallen into a pot of money.  The girl seemed to be working under a sense of assertiveness, tempered by responsibility to a higher power.  That higher power regarded her mother of no consequence.  Though of a naturally dutiful and kindly nature, Bertha assumed an air of independence unbecoming to so young a woman.  Indeed her want of respect was of a piece with her \"Uncle Majesty’s\" behaviour in a little Italian town, when his father lay dying there. The War Lord, then a junior Prince, had crossed the Alps as the representative of his grandsire, head of the State, and instantly presumed to lord over his mother, who was the Princess Royal of an Empire, compared with which his own patrimony is a petty _Seigneurie_.  He arrived on a Saturday night, and at once ordered divine service for seven o’clock next morning, an hour suiting his restlessness and most unsuited to his parent, worn out with night vigils and anxieties.  However, to humour him, and also to gain more time to spend with her ailing husband, the Imperial Mother acquiesced in the arrangement; but imagine her surprise when in the morning she learned at the last moment that, at her son’s behest, the House Marshal had not provided carriages as usual, and that she was expected to walk three-quarters of a mile to the chapel.  Meanwhile the official procession of church-goers had started.  At the head a platoon of cuirassiers, followed by the Prince’s Marshal and staff.  Next, his adjutants and a deputation of officers from his regiment; his personal servants in gala livery; finally, himself, walking alone, the observed of all observers.  The father’s own household was commanded to fall behind.  So were his mother and sisters; the Prince was not at all interested in them.  His Royal Mother might lean on the arm of a footman for all he cared.  Here we have an exaggeration of the most repulsive traits of egotism, self-indulgence, callousness, coarseness, cruelty and deceitfulness, for, as intimated, Wilhelm had been careful to keep his parent in ignorance of the affront to be put upon her.  Small wonder that a person so constituted, having vested himself with full charge of a girl’s soul and mind as she approached mental and physical puberty, upset her filial equilibrium, while her actions reflected the impress of his own arrogance.                                   *CHAPTER VI*                     *FRAULEIN KRUPP INVITED TO COURT*       The Virtue of a Defect—Bertha’s Reception—A Disappointment   There is a streak of malignity in the best of women.  Maybe the younger girl has nothing but praise for another a few years her senior, but she will add that naturally \"age\" inspires respect. Helen has the most beauteous eyes, the daintiest figure, the most transparent complexion, the softest colour, the most exquisite feet, the sweetest smile and the most delightful air of superiority, and when her friend tenders her a box at the Play she will invite some girl conspicuously deficient in most of these excellences—human nature, or just plain, ordinary devilry. So Bertha’s mother took a sort of grim satisfaction in the poor taste Bertha displayed in selecting her Court gowns.  \"He taught her to ignore her mother even in matters of dress; serves him right if her appearance jars on his sense of beauty,\" she said to herself more than once when superintending the packing of Bertha’s many trunks.  The Baroness had never visited the Berlin Court, and her conception of its splendours resided in her own imagination.  As a matter of fact, the Berlin Court is the home of bad taste; plenty of fine shoulders, but draped with ugly and inappropriate material. Some few _petite_ feet against an overwhelming majority too large and clumsily shod.  Some fine arms and hands, since such are subjects of the War-Lord’s appreciation, but faces broad, plain and uninteresting.  The taste of a man who allows his wife to keep a bow-legged attendant is necessarily deplorable; a king permitting that sort of thing, despite prevailing fashions, is inexcusable.  An anecdote in point.  When, in the ’nineties, the Medical Congress sat in Berlin, the learned gentlemen were commanded to a reception at the Palace, and in their honour the whole contingent of Court beauties was put on exhibition.  \"Did you ever see an uglier lot of women?\" asked a Russian professor afterwards, addressing a table full of colleagues.  All shook their heads sadly, depressed by the remembrance of what they had witnessed.  Into this _milieu_ of hallowed ugliness and organised _ennui_ dropped the Krupp heiress like a pink-cheeked apple among a lot of windfalls.  As we know, she was not pretty from the stand-point of the English-speaking races.  Her complexion was good, but it lacked the Scottish maid’s transparency; her hair was fair to look upon, but there are a thousand English girls travelling on the Underground daily whose glossy tresses are to be preferred; her figure was a little too full, like that of Jerome Napoleon’s Queen, Catherine of Würtemberg, whose finely chiselled bosoms scandalised the Tuileries when she was scarcely sixteen.  She had the heavy gait of the German woman, and the vocabulary of them all: \"_Oh Himmel_,\" \"_Ach Gott_,\" \"_Verdammt_,\" and so forth, a dreadful inheritance, which even the \"Semiramis of the North\" could not shake off after fifty and more years’ residence in Imperial Russia.   Her Majesty’s maid of honour, Countess von Bassewitz, went to the station with Count Keller, a minor gold stick, to receive and welcome Bertha. Bassewitz was young and pretty—\"the only happy isle in an ocean of inelegancy,\" as Duke Gonthier of Schleswig used to say.  Her sole perceptible defect was indifferent hands, but, strange to say, this very blemish got her the position at Court.  The War Lord had declared that he wouldn’t have more of the \"hideous baggage\" (meaning Her Majesty’s ladies) that \"made his house a nightmare,\" and that the next Dame du Palais to be appointed was to be good-looking, or must wear a bell, so that he could keep out of her way. His Queen, who regards all women through the jaundiced lorgnette of jealousy, was in despair.  In her mind’s eye she saw the Schloss peopled with Pompadours, Du Barrys and Dianes de Poitiers.  The War Lord had instructed the Court Marshal to demand photographs of applicants for the vacant post, and Countess von Bassewitz’s he considered the most promising.  \"Wire her to report to-morrow morning at eight,\" he ordered.  She arrived while the War Lord was busy lecturing his Council of Ministers on international law, and Her Majesty saw the candidate first.  She couldn’t help admitting to herself that Ina was comely in the extreme, and that it would require a vast deal of intrigue to induce her husband not to appoint the young girl forthwith.  Then a happy thought struck her.  \"You may remove your gloves,\" she said condescendingly.  Countess Ina blushed and grew pale in turn; conscious of her weak point, she was afraid it would work her undoing.  But, instead, Her Majesty smiled benignly upon those unlovely hands.  \"His Majesty!\" announced the valet de chambre.  \"Be gloved, my child; hurry.\"  The War Lord didn’t know what to make of it when \"Dona\" approved of his selection.  \"She is mysteriously confiding,\" he said to his crony, Maxchen (the Prince of Fürstenberg).  But he changed his mind when, a week or two later, he had induced Ina to take off her gloves in his presence.  The War Lord had instructed Bassewitz and Keller to treat Bertha \"like a raw egg,\" saying: \"Her income is bigger per minute "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44979"],["title","The Secret Memoirs of Bertha Krupp (#8)"],["body","that of all you Prussian Junkers per annum\"—a gratuitous slap, the more ungenerous since the old Kings of Prussia gobbled up a goodly part of their landed possessions, as Bismarck once pointed out to Frederick William IV.  Berlin pomp and circumstance!  Three flags, paper flowers on lanterns, a much-worn red carpet leading from the spot where Bertha’s saloon carriage was to draw up to the royal reception room in the station.  As Bertha, though Grand-Lady-Armouress-of-the-World, has no place in the Army List, she must be content with walking through lines of royal footmen in black and silver, on which account the War Lord sincerely pitied the girl.  \"Twenty marks for a precedent to endow her with a uniform,\" but even the obsequious Eulenburg failed to discover an excuse.  Inside the Royal waiting-room: red-plush furniture, with covers removed, in garish glory; a bouquet of flowers from the Potsdam hothouses; a silver teapot steaming; on a silver platter four bits of pastry, one for each person and one over to show that we are not at all niggardly—oh, dear, no!  The stationmaster enters in some kind of uniform, a cocked and plumed hat above a red face, toy sword on thigh.  \"The train is about to draw into the station, Herr Graf, and may it please Her Ladyship.\"  Countess von Bassewitz starts for the door. \"One moment, pray,\" admonishes gold stick, \"the noblesse doesn’t run its feet off to greet a commoner even if she is laden with money.\"  Courtiers suit their vocabulary to their lord and master.  Countess Bassewitz is young and hearty. Never before had she reflected on the sad fact that Bertha lacked birth, but now that a gold stick had mentioned it, a mere maid of honour must needs bow to superior judgment.  So the richest girl in the world was left standing in the doorway of her saloon carriage for a good half-minute before their Majesties’ titled servants deigned to approach.  \"Will take some of the purse-pride out of her,\" observed Count Keller.  Then, hat in hand and held aloft, three bows, well measured, not too low, for high-born personages’ privileges must not be encroached upon.  \"Aham, Aham\" (several courtly grunts, supposed to be exquisitely _recherché_), \"Fraulein Krupp, I have the honour—Count Keller—Countess von Bassewitz, dame to Her Majesty.  Had a pleasant journey I hope,\" delivered in nasal accents.  In Germany, you must know, it is considered most aristocratic to trumpet one’s speech through the nose after the fashion of bad French tenors chanting arias.  Countess von Bassewitz, amiable and enthusiastic, spouted genuine civilities.  \"Fraulein looks charming!\" \"What a pretty frock!\" \"I will show you all around the shops,\" and more compliments and promises of that kind.  Childlike, Bertha had expected a coach-and-four. Another disappointment! The carriage at the royal entrance was of the most ordinary kind—a landau and pair of blacks, such as are driven about Berlin by the dozen.  \"If you please,\" said Count Keller, bowing her into the coach.  She planted herself boldly in the right-hand corner, facing the horses. Bassewitz looked horror-stricken at the heiress’s cool assumption of the gold stick’s place, and to smooth him over attempted to take the rear seat; but Bertha pulled her to her side.  \"Don’t leave me,\" she whispered, with a look upon the ruffled face of the Count, who marvelled that there was no earthquake or rain of meteors because he was obliged to ride backwards, with a \"mechanic’s daughter\" in the seat of honour.                                  *CHAPTER VII*                    *IN THE CROWN PRINCE’S PRIVATE ROOM*       A Talk with the Crown Prince—Matrimonial Affairs—Bertha     Discussed—The Empress and Her Sons   The War Lord had not taken any notice of Frederick the Great’s injunction against \"useless beggar princes.\"  At the time of Bertha’s visit six of them, ranging from twenty-one to thirteen years of age, were roaming the palace, and there was a little girl of eleven besides. Only the eldest boy was provided for, by the Crown Prince’s Endowment Fund; the rest were booked to live by the grace of their father’s munificence and such moneys as could be squeezed out of the public in the shape of military and administrative perquisites, unless they contracted advantageous marriages; for while the Prussian allows himself to be heavily taxed for the Civil List, that jolly institution, grants for His Majesty’s sisters, cousins and aunts has no place in his catalogue of loyalty.  Talking one day to his heir, the War Lord broached the subject of a money-marriage.  \"But mother didn’t have any money,\" the _bête noire_, Crown Prince William, had the temerity to interpose.  \"No cash, it’s true; but our marriage quasi-legitimatised our acquisition of Schleswig-Holstein, and those provinces are worth something.\"  \"Perhaps I had better marry Alexandra or Olga Cumberland,\" suggested young William, \"so that the possession of Hanover can no longer be disputed.  These girls have coin besides.\"  \"Don’t speak of them—there are reasons.\"  \"Or a Hesse girl of the Electoral Branch.\"  \"And turn Catholic like Princess Anna,\" cried the War Lord furiously. \"Shut up about that Danish baggage.  I myself will get you a wife. Trust father to find you the _comme il faut_ wife—_comme il faut_ in every respect: politics, family, religion and personal attractiveness, for we want no ugly women in our family.\"  The Crown Prince opened his mouth for a pert reply, but William forestalled him by an imperious gesture.  \"I am preparing a message for the Ministerial Council.\"  In the evening William invited his younger brothers—Eitel, Albert, Augustus and Oscar—to his rooms, providing a bottle of beer and two cigarettes per head.  Having attained his majority and consequently succeeded to the Dukedom of Oels, the Brunswick inheritance, he might have offered the boys a real treat, champagne and tobacco _ad lib._, but such would have been against Prussian tradition, which stands for parsimony at home and display where it spells cheap glory.  \"Joachim wanted to be of the party,\" said Augustus.  \"And tell Mamma all—not if I know myself. It’s time the kid was in bed anyhow,\" said the Crown Prince with fine scorn, for Joachim was only thirteen years old at the time.  \"He will tell all the same,\" suggested Albert.  \"And will get a thrashing for his pains. Besides, I shall withdraw my allowance of three marks per week.  Tell him so; that will settle the mamma-child.\"  \"He shall have it straight from the shoulder; you can rely on that, Duke of Oels,\" said Eitel.  \"Oels,\" repeated Eitel, \"why didn’t you inherit Sibyllenort too?  The idea, giving Sibyllenort to those sanctimonious Saxons.\"  \"Rotten, to be sure.  But old William was eccentric, you know, like his brother, the Diamond Duke,\" said the Crown Prince.  \"The Diamond Duke; wasn’t he the chap who made some Swiss town erect him a monument, omitting the proviso that it must not tumble down?\" asked Albert, who sets up as a scholar.  \"Precisely so, and the monument is dust.\"  Prince William shook with laughter.  \"But that’s not the question before the house.\"  Willy assumed the oratorical pose favoured by Herr Liebknecht, the Socialist.  \"Boys,\" he continued, actually using the German equivalent for the familiar term, \"what do you think?  Father presumed to find me a wife—me!\"  He repeated the personal pronoun three or four times with increasing emphasis, while beating the board with his clenched fist—a very good imitation of the War Lord himself.  \"I am not beholden to him financially like you, not at all,\" cried the Crown Prince.  \"He can keep his miserable fifteen thousand thalers per annum.  \"No,\" he added quickly, after reflection; \"it will be the greater punishment to take his money.\"  The Crown Prince continued: \"And if father dares propose wife-finding for _me_, what will he do to you, boys?  If he has his way, you won’t marry the girl of your choice, but some political or military possibility.  There is only one way to prevent it,\" insisted the Crown Prince.  \"We must all stand together, declaring our firm determination to do our own wooing without interference from father.  He will plead politics, interests of the Fatherland.  But for my part, I won’t have father impose a wife on me, even if the alliance gained us half of Africa or Persia.\"  \"And I won’t marry a Schleswig,\" said Eitel.  \"Nor I a Lippe, no matter how much Aunt Vicky cracks up Adolph’s family.\"  \"Now then, all together,\" declaimed the Crown Prince.  \"We, Princes Wilhelm, Eitel, Albert, Augustus and Oscar of Prussia, solemnly swear not to have wives imposed upon us for reasons of State or politics, father’s threats, entreaties and personal interests notwithstanding.\"  The boys repeated the impromptu troth word for word.  \"Shake on that,\" said Wilhelm, holding out his hand.  And the agreement was so ratified. Then another round of beer on the Duke of Oels.  As the Princes were draining their _Seidels_—conspicuous for the emblem of the Borussia Students’ Club of Bonn University on the cover—a low whistle was heard outside.  \"The mater,\" whispered Oscar.  \"Push the _Seidels_ into the centre,\" commanded the Crown Prince, helping vigorously. He pushed a concealed button and the centre of the table with its contents disappeared through an opening in the floor, while another set with glasses of lemonade and cakes shot into its place, the floor likewise filling up again.  The Princes were petrified with amazement. \"Duplicate of the Barbarina _table de confiance_,\" explained the big brother; \"had it secretly copied and installed without my Grand Master being the wiser.\"  This sort of table was invented by Frederick the Great for _tête-à-tête_ confidences with Barbarina, the famous Italian beauty.  The sight of the lemonade made the Empress radiant.  \"And I had been told that you were up to all sorts of tricks,\" she said apologetically. And to the Crown Prince: \"I am so glad you are setting your younger"]]]
