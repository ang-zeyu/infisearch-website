It brings vividly back to life the experience of WWII tank warfare as it was fought and endured by soldiers in the tank corps. The novel is also a story of love in French Ermenonville, where Rousseau lived during the last period in his life and was buried.  The title _Forward, Children!_ comes from the opening line of _La Marseillaise_, the French national anthem (_Allons, enfants de la patrie_). _Forward, Children!_ is a novel that was long in the making. Paul Alexander Bartlett completed the first manuscript of _Forward, Children!_ in the years before the outbreak of the second world war. He had been deeply affected by the first world war, by the horrors and suffering it caused. Wishing to bring to readers a convincing and powerful first-hand experience of that war, he portrayed in the first version of _Forward, Children!_ the hardship and terror of tank warfare as it had been conducted by the American Expeditionary Forces Tank Corps during World War I.  Renowned English novelist, poet, and critic Ford Madox Ford thought highly of _Forward, Children!_, and shortly before his death devoted a large part of an essay published in the _Saturday Review of Literature_ to praise for the novel, urging its publication.      \"_Forward, Children!_ ... is the projection of the life of a     fighting soldier in the A. E. Tank Corps in France. It is so to     the life that for some days after reading it, the writer’s     nights were rendered heavy by the return of the lugubrious     dreams that for years after the signing of the Treaty of     Versailles attended on his slumbers. When you read _Forward,     Children!_ you _are_ in a tank crawling amidst unspeakable din     and unthinkable pressure up the sides of houses, and down the     banks of dried-up canals, crashing through the walls of     factories.... [I]f not on artistic grounds then at least for the     public weal this book should be published and widely     circulated.\"  Ford Madox Ford died two weeks after this essay was published in 1939. In the subsequent years, with the attention of the world now fixed on WWII, Bartlett decided to rewrite _Forward, Children!_ to portray tank warfare in the ongoing world war. He had already become knowledgeable about tank warfare in the first world war and he now researched the conditions and accounts of tank fighting in the second. As a result, _Forward, Children!_ builds on the author’s attempt to stand in the combat boots of the tank soldiers of both world wars and conveys to the reader an account of their experience with unforgettable realism.  _Forward, Children!_ was ironically never published during the author’s life, despite the strongest commendations the work received not only from Ford Madox Ford, but also from John Dos Passos, who remarked: \"Praise from Ford Madox Ford is praise indeed. The descriptions of tank warfare are vivid and as far as I know unique. This is a very, very good novel.\"  Russell Kirk added his admiration for the novel: \"Permit me to commend _Forward, Children!_ The novel attains a pathos rare in war novels. The scenes of battle are drawn with power. Bartlett is an accomplished writer.\" Pearl Buck, Nobel Laureate in Literature, wrote: \"He [Bartlett] is an excellent writer. _Forward, Children!_ is an excellent piece of work, with fine characterizations.\"  Upton Sinclair wrote: \"I found _Forward, Children!_ extremely interesting and convincing. I think it is one of the best descriptions of fighting I have ever read. In fact, I can’t remember any account of tank fighting in such detail and [which is so] convincing.\" James Purdy remarked: \"_Forward, Children!_ ranks with the best books--its anti-war message is inescapable. It is an important book and [Bartlett is] an important writer.\"  _Forward, Children!_ eventually came to interest a small press in war-scarred Korea; in 1998, the press published the book in a limited edition that has reached few readers. To remedy this, the author’s literary executor has decided to re-publish the book in open access form as an eBook to be made freely available to readers through Project Gutenberg.  Whatever the obstacles have been that so often stand in the way of authors, and that plague the world of publishing, after many, many decades it is time for _Forward, Children!_ to reach its readers.                                *ABOUT THE AUTHOR*   Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909-1990) was both a writer and an artist, born in Moberly, Missouri, and educated at Oberlin College, the University of Arizona, the Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City, and the Instituto de Bellas Artes in Guadalajara. His work can be divided into three categories: He is the author of many novels, short stories, and poems; second, as a fine artist, his drawings, illustrations, and paintings have been exhibited in more than 40 one-man shows in leading galleries, including the Los Angeles County Museum, the Atlanta Art Museum, the Bancroft Library, the Richmond Art Institute, the Brooks Museum, the Instituto-Mexicano-Norteamericano in Mexico City, and many other galleries; and, third, he devoted much of his life to the most comprehensive study of the haciendas of Mexico that has been undertaken.  Three hundred and fifty of his pen-and-ink illustrations of the haciendas and more than one thousand hacienda photographs make up the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection held by the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection of the University of Texas, and form part of a second diversified collection held by the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming, which also includes an extensive archive of Bartlett’s literary work, fine art, and letters. A third archive consisting primarily of Bartlett’s literary work is held by the Department of Special Collections at UCLA. Bartlett’s book about the history and life on the haciendas, including a selection of his illustrations"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44717"],["title","Forward, Children!

Paul Alexander Bartlett’s fiction has been commended by many authors, among them Pearl Buck, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James Michener, Upton Sinclair, Evelyn Eaton, and many others. He was the recipient of numerous grants, awards, and fellowships, from such organizations as the Leopold Schepp Foundation, the Edward MacDowell Association, the New School for Social Research, the Huntington Hartford Foundation, the Montalvo Foundation, Yaddo, and the Carnegie Foundation. His novel _When the Owl Cries_ received national acclaim; his fine art has been exhibited throughout the United States and in Mexico; his poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals and anthologies and has been published in individual volumes of his collected poetry. Bartlett was very prolific and left to the archives of his work many as yet unpublished manuscripts, including poetry, short stories, and novels, as well as more than a thousand paintings and illustrations.  His wife, Elizabeth Bartlett, a widely published and internationally recognized poet, is the author of seventeen published books of poetry, more than one thousand individually published poems, numerous short stories and essays in leading literary quarterlies and anthologies, and, as the founder of Literary Olympics, Inc., served as the editor of a series of multi-language volumes of international poetry to honor the work of outstanding contemporary poets.  The author of this Introduction (Paul and Elizabeth Bartlett’s only child)]  apparently inherited their writer’s gene and has published books and articles in the fields of philosophy and psychology.               *      *      *      *      *      *      *      *                              *Forward, Children!*                                  *PORTRAIT*   Orville Dennison was five feet eleven inches tall and weighed a hundred and fifty pounds.  He had the body of an athlete, the body of a crewman and a tennis player.  His eyes were brown with flecks of grey in them.  He had brown hair and combed it straight back and when it was long it bulged out on the sides and had waves that crossed from ear to ear, waves that were sun bleached on the top.  His nose was aquiline, his mouth was thin-lipped and rather small.  He had large ears.  His eyebrows were bushy and his lashes were long and thick.  His forehead was broad but was not unusual except that it was very smooth while the skin of his face, which was rather florid, had enlarged pores here and there.  His hands were wide across the back and his fingers were strong; his shoulders and arms were muscular.  He walked quickly with a natural swing.  He had a ready smile and even teeth.  His voice was pleasant.  He was twenty-four.  One was struck by the sadness in his face, the careworn lines about his mouth and eyes.                                       *1*   Landel shook Dennison’s shoulder.  \"Whatcha want?\" Dennison mumbled, raising himself on one elbow and unconsciously pushing aside his blanket.  \"The supply trucks have come,\" Landel yelled.  \"Who’s come?\"  \"The trucks and tanks are here.  Three trucks have brought supplies. We’ve got food.  Are you awake?  Hey, do you hear me?\"  \"What did you say?  Sure, sure, I’m awake,\" Dennison replied hazily.  He squinted and ducked as Landel shot the beam of his flashlight directly into his face.  Landel knelt down beside Dennison and fumbled about the floor of the abandoned plank and sandbag irrigation shack for his tank helmet.  His tall body almost filled the place.  His bald head looked repulsively bald to Dennison--something surgical.  \"I let ya sleep a little longer than the other guys,\" Landel yelled. \"Yeah, you needed sleep.\"  He shifted his flashlight around the crude shack, over the mounds of blankets where their crewmates had been sleeping.  \"Our kitchen’s here!  The trucks are here ... three of them,\" he repeated.  \"We’ve got something hot to eat,\" he hollered.  \"Are you awake?\"  He pushed Dennison--shoved him against the floor. \"Come on, get out of here!\"  \"What time is it?\" Dennison asked.  \"Nearly fifteen ... we’ve got to get moving,\" Landel crabbed. He found his helmet underneath a sandy, greasy blanket and stuck it on.  \"Raub’s got here with his kitchen ... so, let’s go ... okay? Now?\"  He was talking to himself, spitting out words, annoyed by the day’s problems, war’s problems.  He rose from his knees and, stooping low to keep from cracking himself against the roof, edged, crab-fashion, toward the door.  \"I’m leavin’ ... I’m goin’,\" he cried.  \"I’ll be along in a minute,\" Dennison said, yawning and propping himself against the wall, legs and shoulders feeling stiff.  Landel reappeared.  \"Go on ... I’m awake!\" he shouted.  \"See you at the chuck wagon.\"  \"We’ve got to eat quick ... we’ve a hell of a lot to do,\" Landel screamed, his head in the doorway.  He zoomed his flashlight into Dennison’s eyes, like a warning, and walked off.  Angry, Dennison rubbed his hands over his bearded face, slumped down onto the floor again.  Through the doorway he caught glimpses of the flashlights and lanterns of men headed for the kitchen: legs and lights passed with metronome jerkiness across the sand: dust came up from beneath boots.  Shellfire rumbled in the distance, a sound that had in it all the vacuity of the African desert.  A jab of wind dribbled sand through the doorway and shook sand from the make-shift roof of the shelter where only yesterday gunners had been trapped emplacing a gun.  Dennison smelled the stench of gasoline and grease from the tanks and a tank dump nearby; he could smell the gas and grease on his clothes; it seemed to swirl around him.  The incoming air was chilly.  Shivering, he hauled a blanket around him and with his shoulders against a sandbag, lit a cigarette.  As his lighter flared he noticed his squashed, grease-pocked helmet; sleepily, he reached for it and placed it across his lap, pressing it down, making it a part of him.  One hand holding his pack of cigarettes, the other bringing a cigarette to his mouth, he tried to think.  It seemed to him that he had dreamed during the night.  The tip of the cigarette glowed encouragingly.  Yes, he had dreamed about the library tower, the chimes, the sounds travelling down the hill slopes, down toward Lake Cayuga, the tower and the sounds blurring.  Kids were sitting in the library, at long tables, faces, faces.  There seemed to be an elm tree at the far end of the reading room, snow, lake ...  He tried to remember the sound of those chimes.  Huddled against sandbags, he drowsed and as he drowsed he saw a campfire in the woods somewhere, students standing around the fire, some of them singing.  A guy was playing his harmonica, muting his music by cupping both hands over the instrument ...  Dennison’s arms and hands had fallen asleep.  Yesterday the pace across the desert had been formidable, the heat increasing, a shortage of water, the water warm and sickening, nothing at all to eat at noon ...  He shook his hands and arms to bring back the circulation, groaning, cold, the exhaust of a tank stinking and coughing nearby. The sound brought with it the sensation of violent pitching, the distress of gasoline and oil fumes, the threat of shellfire at close range.  Shoving his sweater inside his trouser, adjusting his belt, he knelt and fished about: his helmet had rolled heedlessly and bumped against the wall: recovering it, he strapped it on, tilting it over his forehead, aware of its grime.  Slipping on his leather jacket, yanking the zipper, he wormed about the blankets for his mess kit and stepped out into the open, feeling sand drop off his clothes.  Outdoors, his cigarette tasted better and he inhaled deeply to help wake up.  The chilly air nipped his face and hands, as he stood motionless urinating.  Behind the shack rose a tangle of rusty machinery from an irrigation pump, the machinery snarled over a cannon-sized conduit, the pipe’s mouth toward the sky.  The stars seemed closer because of the junked pipes and gears: the sky, utterly cloudless, was defiant: in a few hours its sun would be hammering, leading on and on, sand gobbling sand, dunes blurring into hills: heat and flies would move it together, thirst would be everywhere.  A G.I. scuffed by, coughing and spitting.  \"Raub’s here,\" he called, noticing Dennison and his cigarette. \"We’re ready to eat!\"  He coughed again.  Dennison wet his lips with his tongue and swallowed.  \"I’m right behind you,\" he said.  \"Wait a second ... I’ve got my flashlight.  Here, Millard!\"  He pulled his flash from his jacket pocket and walked behind his crewmate--the sand deep, their boots scuffing, the flashlight wobbling as if asleep.  \"Gonna get hot today,\" Millard hollered.  \"Can’t hear you,\" Dennison hollered.  \"Any news on the radio?\"  \"What was it you said?\"  Raub had his kitchen under lopsided leafless trees and a scabby fire of branches burned close to it, kitchen and blaze hidden behind a dune, an enormous crested thing with skeletal brush and camel grass growing on its side.  Gaunt, set off by stars, it threatened the kitchen and men, hung, swollen, a thing of unbelievable weight.  Yellow light crept up the slope and bounced off the scarred steel of the field kitchen.  Steam gushed from pots at the rear of the stove; the air smelled of coffee and hash.  His flashlight in his pocket, Dennison worked his way through sixty or eighty men, brushing sand out of a mess kit with a dirty handkerchief and the palm of his hand.  It seemed to him that he had done this many times.  \"Hi,\" he greeted one of the Corps.  \"Hi, Dennison ... Hi.  Goddamn desert, cold.  Freeze off your ass.\"  The man drained his coffee and then blew into the bottom of his cup. \"Coffee’s good,\" he said.  \"Give me a cup of coffee,\" Dennison said to Raub, at the kitchen: Raub had his coffee pot raised for "]]]
