Another is dressed in a sporting suit, adorned with a plush hat and binoculars. Pale blue tunics, with shining belts of fawn color or patent leather, follow and steer the civilians.  With an arm where a brassard glitters in gold-edged silk and golden ornament, a captain indicates the firing-step in front of an old emplacement and invites the visitors to get up and try it. The gentleman in the touring suit clambers up with the aid of his umbrella.  Says Barque, \"You've seen the station-master at the Gare du Nord, all in his Sunday best, and opening the door of a first-class compartment for a rich sportsman on the first day of the shooting? With his 'Montez, monsieur le Propritaire!'--you know, when the toffs are all togged up in brand-new outfits and leathers and ironmongery, and showing off with all their paraphernalia for killing poor little animals!\"  Three or four poilus who were quite without their accouterments have disappeared underground. The others sit as though paralyzed. Even the pipes go out, and nothing is heard but the babble of talk exchanged by the officers and their guests.  \"Trench tourists,\" says Barque in an undertone, and then louder--\"This way, mesdames et messieurs\"--in the manner of the moment.  \"Chuck it!\" whispers Farfadet, fearing that Barque's malicious tongue will draw the attention of the potent personages.  Some heads in the group are now turned our way. One gentleman who detaches himself and comes up wears a soft hat and a loose tie. He has a white billy-goat beard, and might be an artiste. Another follows him, wearing a black overcoat, a black bowler hat, a black beard, a white tie and an eyeglass.  \"Ah, ah! There are some poilus,\" says the first gentleman. \"These are real poilus, indeed.\"  He comes up to our party a little timidly, as though in the Zoological Gardens, and offers his hand to the one who is nearest to him--not without awkwardness, as one offers a piece of bread to the elephant.  \"He, he! They are drinking coffee,\" he remarks.  \"They call it 'the juice,'\" corrects the magpie-man.  \"Is it good, my friends?\" The soldier, abashed in his turn by this alien and unusual visitation, grunts, giggles, and reddens, and the gentleman says, \"He, he!\" Then, with a slight motion of the head, he withdraws backwards.  The assemblage, with its neutral shades of civilian cloth and its sprinkling of bright military hues--like geraniums and hortensias in the dark soil of a flowerbed--oscillates, then passes, and moves off the opposite way it came. One of the officers was heard to say, \"We have yet much to see, messieurs les journalistes.\"  When the radiant spectacle has faded away, we look at each other. Those who had fled into the funk-holes now gradually and head first disinter themselves. The group recovers itself and shrugs its shoulders.  \"They're journalists,\" says Tirette.  \"Journalists?\"  \"Why, yes, the individuals that lay the newspapers. You don't seem to catch on, fathead. Newspapers must have chaps to write 'em.\"  \"Then it's those that stuff up our craniums?\" says Marthereau.  Barque assumes a shrill treble, and pretending that he has a newspaper in front of his nose, recites--\"'The Crown Prince is mad, after having been killed at the beginning of the campaign, and meanwhile he has all the diseases you can name. William will die this evening, and again to-morrow. The Germans have no more munitions and are chewing wood. They cannot hold out, according to the most authoritative calculations, beyond the end of the week. We can have them when we like, with their rifles slung. If one can wait a few days longer, there will be no desire to forsake the life of the trenches. One is so comfortable there, with water and gas laid on, and shower-baths at every step. The only drawback is that it is rather too hot in winter. As for the Austrians, they gave in a long time since and are only pretending.' For fifteen months now it's been like that, and you can hear the editor saying to his scribes, 'Now, boys, get into it! Find some way of brushing that up again for me in five secs, and make it spin out all over those four damned white sheets that we've got to mucky.'\"  \"Ah, yes!\" says Fouillade.  \"Look here, corporal; you're making fun of it--isn't it true what I said?\"  \"There's a little truth in it, but you're too slashing on the poor boys, and you'd be the first to make a song about it if you had to go without papers. Oui, when the paper-man's going by, why do you all shout, 'Here, here'?\"  \"And what good can you get out of them all?\" cries Papa Blaire. \"Read 'em by the tubful if you like, but do the same as me--don't believe 'em!\"  \"Oui, oui, that's enough about them. Turn the page over, donkey-nose.\"  The conversation is breaking up; interest in it follows suit and is scattered. Four poilus join in a game of manille, that will last until night blacks out the cards. Volpatte is trying to catch a leaf of cigarette paper that has escaped his fingers and goes hopping and dodging in the wind along the wall of the trench like a fragile butterfly.  Cocon and Tirette are recalling their memories of barrack-life. The impressions left upon their minds by those years of military training are ineffaceable. Into that fund of abundant souvenirs, of abiding color and instant service, they have been wont to dip for their subjects of conversation for ten, fifteen, or twenty years. So that they still frequent it, even after a year and a half of actual war in all its forms.  I can hear some of the talk and guess the rest of it. For it is everlastingly the same sort of tale that they get out of their military past;--the narrator once shut up a bad-tempered N.C.O. with words of extreme appropriateness and daring. He wasn't afraid, he spoke out loud and strong! Some scraps of it reach my ears--  \"Alors, d'you think I flinched when Nenoeil said that to me? Not a bit, my boy. All the pals kept their jaws shut but me; I spoke up, 'Mon adjudant,' I says, 'it's possible, but--'\" A sentence follows that I cannot secure--\"Oh, tu sais, just like that, I said it. He didn't get shirty; 'Good, that's good,' he says as he hops it, and afterwards he was as good as all that, with me.\"  \"Just like me, with Dodore, 'jutant of the 13th, when I was on leave--a mongrel. Now he's at the Pantheon, as caretaker. He'd got it in for me, so--\"  So each unpacks his own little load of historical anecdote. They are all alike, and not one of them but says, \"As for me, I am not like the others.\"        *      *      *      *      *  The post-orderly! He is a tall and broad man with fat calves; comfortable looking, and as neat and tidy as a policeman. He is in a bad temper. There are new orders, and now he has to go every day as far as Battalion Headquarters. He abuses the order as if it had been directed exclusively against himself; and he continues to complain even while he calls up the corporals for the post and maintains his customary chat en passant with this man and that. And in spite of his spleen he does not keep to himself all the information with which he comes provided. While removing the string from the letter-packets he dispenses his verbal news, and announces first, that according to rumor, there is a very explicit ban on the wearing of hoods.  \"Hear that?\" says Tirette to Tirloir. \"Got to chuck your fine hood away!\"  \"Not likely! I'm not on. That's nothing to do with me,\" replies the hooded one, whose pride no less than his comfort is at stake.  \"Order of the General Commanding the Army.\"  \"Then let the General give an order that it's not to rain any more. I want to know nothing about it.\"  The majority of Orders, even when less peculiar than this one, are always received in this way--and then carried out.  \"There's a reported order as well,\" says the man of letters, \"that beards have got to be trimmed and hair got to be clipped close.\"  \"Talk on, my lad,\" says Barque, on whose head the threatened order directly falls; \"you didn't see me! You can draw the curtains!\"  \"I'm telling you. Do it or don't do it--doesn't matter a damn to me.\"  Besides what is real and written, there is bigger news, but still more dubious and imaginative--the division is going to be relieved, and sent either to rest--real rest, for six weeks--or to Morocco, or perhaps to Egypt.  Divers exclamations. They listen, and let themselves be tempted by the fascination of the new, the wonderful.  But some one questions the post-orderly: \"Who told you that?\"  \"The adjutant commanding the Territorial detachment that fatigues for the H.Q. of the A.C.\"  \"For the what?\"  \"For Headquarters of the Army Corps, and he's not the only one that says it. There's--you know him--I've forgotten his name--he's like Galle, but he isn't Galle--there's some one in his family who is Some One. Anyway, he knows all about it.\"  \"Then what?\" With hungry eyes they form a circle around the story-teller.  \"Egypt, you say, we shall go to? Don't know it. I know there were Pharaohs there at the time when I was a kid and went to school, but since--\"  \"To Egypt!\" The idea finds unconscious anchorage in their minds.  \"Ah, non,\" says Blaire, \"for I get sea-sick. Still, it doesn't last, sea-sickness. Oui, but what would my good lady say?\"  \"What about it? She'll get used to it. You see niggers, and streets full of big birds, like we see sparrows here.\"  \"But haven't we to go to Alsace?\"  \"Yes,\" says the post-orderly, \"there are some who think so at the Pay-office.\"  \"That'd do me well enough.\"  But common sense and acquired experience regain the upper hand and put the visions to flight. We have been told so often that we were going a long way off, so often have we believed it, so often been undeceived! So, as if at a moment arranged, we wake up.  \"It's all my eye--they've done it on us too often. Wait before believing--and don't count a crumb's worth on it.\"  We reoccupy our corner. Here and there a man bears in his hand "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4380"],["title","Under Fire: The Story of a Squad (#7)"],["body","light momentous burden of a letter.  \"Ah,\" says Tirloir, \"I must be writing. Can't go eight days without writing.\"  \"Me too,\" says Eudore, \"I must write to my p'tit' femme.\"  \"Is she all right, Mariette?\"  \"Oui, oui, don't fret about Mariette.\"  A few have already settled themselves for correspondence. Barque is standing up. He stoops over a sheet of paper flattened on a note-book upon a jutting crag in the trench wall. Apparently in the grip of an inspiration, he writes on and on, with his eyes in bondage and the concentrated expression of a horseman at full gallop.  When once Lamuse--who lacks imagination--has sat down, placed his little writing-block on the padded summit of his knees, and moistened his copying-ink pencil, he passes the time in reading again the last letters received, in wondering what he can say that he has not already said, and in fostering a grim determination to say something else.  A sentimental gentleness seems to have overspread little Eudore, who is curled up in a sort of niche in the ground. He is lost in meditation, pencil in hand, eyes on paper. Dreaming, he looks and stares and sees. It is another sky that lends him light, another to which his vision reaches. He has gone home.  In this time of letter-writing, the men reveal the most and the best that they ever were. Several others surrender to the past, and its first expression is to talk once more of fleshly comforts.  Through their outer crust of coarseness and concealment, other hearts venture upon murmured memories, and the rekindling of bygone brightness: the summer morning, when the green freshness of the garden steals in upon the purity of the country bedroom; or when the wind in the wheat of the level lands sets it slowly stirring or deeply waving, and shakes the square of oats hard by into quick little feminine tremors; or the winter evening, with women and their gentleness around the shaded luster of the lamp.  But Papa Blaire resumes work upon the ring he has begun. He has threaded the still formless disc of aluminium over a bit of rounded wood, and rubs it with the file. As he applies himself to the job, two wrinkles of mighty meditation deepen upon his forehead. Anon he stops, straightens himself, and looks tenderly at the trifle, as though she also were looking at it.  \"You know,\" he said to me once, speaking of another ring, \"it's not a question of doing it well or not well. The point is that I've done it for my wife, d'you see? When I had nothing to do but scratch myself, I used to have a look at this photo\"--he showed me a photograph of a big, chubby-faced woman--\"and then it was quite easy to set about this damned ring. You might say that we've made it together, see? The proof of that is that it was company for me, and that I said Adieu to it when I sent it off to Mother Blaire.\"  He is making another just now, and this one will have copper in it, too. He works eagerly. His heart would fain express itself to the best advantage in this the sort of penmanship upon which he is so tenaciously bent.  As they stoop reverently, in their naked earth-holes, over the slender rudimentary trinkets--so tiny that the great hide-bound hands hold them with difficulty or let them fall--these men seem still more wild, more primitive, and more human, than at all other times.  You are set thinking of the first inventor, the father of all craftsmen, who sought to invest enduring materials with the shapes of what he saw and the spirit of what he felt.        *      *      *      *      *  \"People coming along,\" announces Biquet the mobile, who acts as hall-porter to our section of the trench--\"buckets of 'em.\" Immediately an adjutant appears, with straps round his belly and his chin, and brandishing his sword-scabbard.  \"Out of the way, you! Out of the way, I tell you! You loafers there, out of it! Let me see you quit, hey!\" We make way indolently. Those at the sides push back into the earth by slow degrees.  It is a company of Territorials, deputed to our sector for the fortification of the second line and the upkeep of its communication trenches. They come into view--miserable bundles of implements, and dragging their feet.  We watch them, one by one, as they come up, pass, and disappear. They are stunted and elderly, with dusty faces, or big and broken-winded, tightly enfolded in greatcoats stained and over-worn, that yawn at the toothless gaps where the buttons are missing.  Tirette and Barque, the twin wags, leaning close together against the wall, stare at them, at first in silence. Then they begin to smile.  \"March past of the Broom Brigade,\" says Tirette.  \"We'll have a bit of fun for three minutes,\" announces Barque.  Some of the old toilers are comical. This one whom the file brings up has bottle-shaped shoulders. Although extremely narrow-chested and spindle-shanked, he is big-bellied. He is too much for Barque. \"Hullo, Sir Canteen!\" he says.  When a more outrageously patched-up greatcoat appears than all the others can show, Tirette questions the veteran recruit. \"Hey, Father Samples! Hey, you there!\" he insists.  The other turns and looks at him, open-mouthed.  \"Say there, papa, if you will be so kind as to give me the address of your tailor in London!\"  A chuckle comes from the antiquated and wrinkle-scrawled face, and then the poilu, checked for an instant by Barque's command, is jostled by the following flood and swept away.  When some less striking figures have gone past, a new victim is provided for the jokers. On his red and wrinkled neck luxuriates some dirty sheep's-wool. With knees bent, his body forward, his back bowed, this Territorial's carriage is the worst.  \"Tiens!\" bawls Tirette, with pointed finger, \"the famous concertina-man! It would cost you something to see him at the fair--here, he's free gratis!\"  The victim stammers responsive insults amid the scattered laughter that arises.  No more than that laughter is required to excite the two comrades. It is the ambition to have their jests voted funny by their easy audience that stimulates them to mock the peculiarities of their old comrades-in-arms, of those who toil night and day on the brink of the great war to make ready and make good the fields of battle.  And even the other watchers join in. Miserable themselves, they scoff at the still more miserable.  \"Look at that one! And that, look!\"  \"Non, but take me a snapshot of that little rump-end! Hey, earth-worm!\"  \"And that one that has no ending! Talk about a sky-scratcher! Tiens, la, he takes the biscuit. Yes, you take it, old chap!\"  This man goes with little steps, and holds his pickax up in front like a candle; his face is withered, and his body borne down by the blows of lumbago.  \"Like a penny, gran'pa?\" Barque asks him, as he passes within reach of a tap on the shoulder.  The broken-down poilu replies with a great oath of annoyance, and provokes the harsh rejoinder of Barque: \"Come now, you might be polite, filthy-face, old muck-mill!\"  Turning right round in fury, the old one defies his tormentor.  \"Hullo!\" cries Barque, laughing, \"He's showing fight; the ruin! He's warlike, look you, and he might be mischievous if only he were sixty years younger!\"  \"And if he wasn't alone,\" wantonly adds Pepin, whose eye is in quest of other targets among the flow of new arrivals.  The hollow chest of the last straggler appears, and then his distorted back disappears.  The march past of the worn-out and trench-foul veterans comes to an end among the ironical and almost malevolent faces of these sinister troglodytes, whom their caverns of mud but half reveal.  Meanwhile, the hours slip away, and evening begins to veil the sky and darken the things of earth. It comes to blend itself at once with the blind fate and the ignorant dark minds of the multitude there enshrouded.  Through the twilight comes the rolling hum of tramping men, and another throng rubs its way through.  \"Africans!\"  They march past with faces red-brown, yellow or chestnut, their beards scanty and fine or thick and frizzled, their greatcoats yellowish-green, and their muddy helmets sporting the crescent in place of our grenade. Their eyes are like balls of ivory or onyx, that shine from faces like new pennies, flattened or angular. Now and again comes swaying along above the line the coal-black mask of a Senegalese sharpshooter. Behind the company goes a red flag with a green hand in the center.  We watch them in silence. These are asked no questions. They command respect, and even a little fear.  All the same, these Africans seem jolly and in high spirits. They are going, of course, to the first line. That is their place, and their passing is the sign of an imminent attack. They are made for the offensive.  \"Those and the 75 gun we can take our hats off to. They're everywhere sent ahead at big moments, the Moroccan Division.\"  \"They can't quite fit in with us. They go too fast--and there's no way of stopping them.\"  Some of these diabolical images in yellow wood or bronze or ebony are serious of mien, uneasy, and taciturn. Their faces have the disquieting and secret look of the snare suddenly discovered. The others laugh with a laugh that jangles like fantastic foreign instruments of music, a laugh that bares the teeth.  We talk over the characteristics of these Africans; their ferocity in attack, their devouring passion to be in with the bayonet, their predilection for \"no quarter.\" We recall those tales that they themselves willingly tell, all in much the same words and with the same gestures. They raise their arms over their heads--\"Kam'rad, Kam'rad!\" \"Non, pas Kam'rad!\" And in pantomime they drive a bayonet forward, at belly-height, drawing it back then with the help of a foot.  One of the sharpshooters overhears our talk as he passes. He looks upon us, laughs abundantly in his helmeted turban, and repeats our words with significant shakes of his head: \"Pas Kam'rad, non pas Kam'rad, never! Cut head off!\"  \"No doubt they're a"]]]
