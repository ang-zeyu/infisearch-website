But even if, by dint of good fortune or special good management, a vessel managed to pass the Mole batteries and the booms, she would still have to run the gantlet of the naval vessels in the anchorage and the batteries on shore before reaching the canal.  [Illustration: THE NORTHEASTERN END OF THE MOLE   a. The shadows of the parapet wall and of the lighthouse      at its extremity   b. The Mole batteries   c.

The boom of entanglement nets]  The German torpedo craft, which were available for local duty, used to berth alongside the inner side of the Mole, close to the westward of the barge boom.  By virtue of their guns, torpedoes, and searchlights, and the fact that they probably kept up steam in readiness for instant action, these craft provided a valuable addition to the Mole and canal defences.  The foregoing description of the local defences at Zeebrugge has probably been sufficiently detailed to lead to the conclusion that the Germans were fully alive to the possibility of attacks on the Mole or canal.  Whether or not they considered that such attacks would only form part of some more ambitious operation, such as a military landing on the coast, our enemies had left practically no stone unturned to repel them.  The defence measures must have {34} appeared, especially to those on the spot, to be more than sufficient.  It is well known that, although the possession of detailed local knowledge will usually be of great value towards the formation of plans of attack, there are occasions when local knowledge is apt to make local difficulties loom extremely large.  For instance, in this particular case, the navigational difficulties caused by the strong tidal stream, the difficulty of recognising objects on the low-lying shore during darkness, the uninviting appearance of the outer Mole wall as an obstacle to be surmounted, and many other matters would probably have induced the belief, in those who were actually acquainted with these difficulties, that such attacks would have no chance of success. There is, therefore, reason to believe that, although they realised an attack might be attempted, the Germans were perfectly satisfied that the defences could neither be improved nor penetrated.  The reader will probably have arrived at the conclusion that the Germans were devilish in their thoroughness.  Yet there was still one joint left in their armour--and we penetrated it.  But I must not anticipate.     {35}  CHAPTER III  THE OUTLYING OBSTACLES.  CONSIDERATIONS OF SALVAGE.  Thus far I have only dealt with the local defences of Zeebrugge.  But there were many other obstacles in our way--such as the coast batteries, mines, surface patrol vessels, submarines, aircraft, and the vagaries of the weather in addition to the navigational difficulties mentioned in the first chapter.  The coast-line of Flanders bristled with guns.  The section of the coast from three miles west of Ostende to six miles east of Zeebrugge, approximately twenty-one miles in length, was defended by two hundred and twenty-five guns; one hundred and thirty-six of these were of the heavy type, i.e., six-inch and above, up to fifteen-inch guns.  At one period of the war, soon after the Germans first obtained possession of that locality, the coast defences had been few and far between.  In those days our ships used to bombard from such short ranges as ten thousand yards.  In course of time heavier guns were set up on shore so that our vessels were forced to keep at a more respectful distance.  The first bombardments from ten thousand yards had been answered by the establishment of German guns having a range of fifteen thousand yards.  When better weapons became available for bombardment from twenty thousand yards the Germans replied with guns {36} firing up to twenty-five thousand yards.  And thus the duel continued.  Finally, the ranges increased to upwards of forty thousand yards (twenty-three land miles).  Monitors were specially constructed for this purpose and their marksmanship was wonderfully accurate.  This accuracy is borne out by the fact that scarcely any damage was caused to the residential quarter, although Ostende was bombarded again and again; yet works of military importance, such as docks and railway stations, closely adjoining the residential quarter, were hit time after time.  In a straightforward gunnery duel between a ship and a fort, within the effective range of each, the former stands no chance.  In these days, however, such duels savour little of the old-time broadside fighting between ships.  Even the largest and most modern coast guns are of comparatively small avail for defensive purposes unless the attacking ships are visible, or unless the firing can be controlled satisfactorily by such indirect means as the use of aircraft for observational purposes.  At night the attackers must be illuminated by star-shell, flares, or searchlights. Under the ordinary fog conditions--i.e., when the whole locality is obscured by fog--aircraft cannot observe the results of firing nor can the attacking forces be illuminated.  Under exceptional fog conditions--i.e., when a fog (natural or artificial) lies between the shore guns and the attacking vessels, the latter being in clear weather--good co-operation between the batteries and aircraft in daylight enables the fire to be directed so accurately as to ensure destruction to vessels which remain in the danger zone.  [Illustration: A portion of Chart 1406, showing the Dover Strait, the waters between Dover and Zeebrugge, the shoals, the extent of the German minefields, the section of fortified coast (shaded), and the danger zone of the German batteries.]  {37}  The only alternative to directed firing is that of barrage firing, such as is used so greatly in modern land warfare.  The defence guns can establish a shell barrage, for a limited period, across any zone which the attacking ship is attempting to penetrate _en route_ to her objective.  The vessel which steams into an efficient heavy gun barrage from modern guns is unlikely to survive.  [Sidenote: German Coast Defences]  I afterwards visited one of the large German batteries near Ostende, called the Jakobynessen battery, which mounted fifteen-inch guns and fired projectiles weighing nearly one ton each--seventeen hundredweight to be precise.  They were mounted in specially constructed gun-pits amongst the sand-hills close behind the shore, and were so well hidden that they could not be seen from a distance of little more than a single gun's length.  The projectiles stood over six feet high and were murderous-looking instruments of warfare.  These particular guns, and there were others of a like nature, could probably have ranged up to sixty thousand yards (over thirty-four land miles).  The whole area off this section of the coast, up to about twenty miles to seaward, was included in the danger zone of the coast batteries.  No vessel could maintain her position in that area, under ordinary conditions of visibility, for more than a few minutes at the outside limit.  The reader may consider, however, that a ship desiring to attack the coast would merely have to approach in foggy weather or under cover of darkness.  In foggy weather she would be unable to locate her objective--so that can be ruled out.  At night she might conceivably arrive within a few thousand yards without being seen or heard.  {38} But immediately she was located by the defences the latter would fire their star-shell and switch on their searchlights.  The whole area would thus be illuminated like daylight.  The vessel discovered under such conditions would probably be blown to pieces within five minutes.  Thus it is manifest that ships cannot approach a hostile coast, in the face of modern defences, under the ordinary conditions of daylight or darkness, or in fog.  We will now consider the mine problem.  The German mine-fields extended to a distance of several miles from the coast.  We had reason to know of their presence; from time to time, as reported in the press, our vessels had been blown up.  Mine-fields off one's own coast provide a certain measure of defence. But they are also an embarrassment in that one's own vessels cannot pass through them, when approaching or leaving harbour, unless safe channels are kept clear for the purpose.  This applied to the mine-fields under review.  [Sidenote: The German Mine-fields]  The reader may possibly have jumped to the conclusion that all we had to do was to navigate calmly through the German safe channels.  It certainly sounds plausible.  As a matter of fact, such an idea borders on the ridiculous.  Let us think this matter out carefully.  Our forces could not pass through such channels unless they possessed information as to the positions of those channels.  But if such information were received, the chances would be long odds on the information having been \"made in Germany.\"  Far from such information being correct, therefore, the positions mentioned would probably be those of the most dangerous mine-fields.  Nevertheless, suppose {39} we received information which, from the nature of its source and data, we had every reason to credit; and suppose we acted on such information.  Well, on the voyage across the sea, or even before we actually start, the enemy discover that we intend to attack.  What will they do?  Their argument would be as follows: \"The British are coming over to attack us; they may have discovered the positions of our safe channels; we dare not take any chances so we will mine our own safe channels immediately.\" Mine-layers, kept ready for instant use, would be sent to sea at once. In a very short space of time,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45718"],["title","The Blocking of Zeebrugge (#8)"],["body"," an hour would be more than sufficient, the previous safe channels would have been converted into areas of the greatest danger.  There are alternative methods which the attackers may adopt.  Firstly, they may advance to the attack preceded by a force of mine-sweepers. Now mine-sweeping is a very slow process if it is to be carried out thoroughly.  It is inconceivable that a large force of these vessels could steam about, mine-sweeping, near the enemy's coast for a considerable period without being discovered.  Their discovery would give the whole show away; the enemy would know that we were approaching; the whole element of surprise would be lost.  The other method open to the attackers is that of proceeding to their objective without mine-sweepers, after having carefully weighed the probabilities of danger existing on the various alternative routes, and, on arriving at the danger area, passing through it and _chancing the result_.  And that is what we did--we chanced it!  But I am anticipating once more.  {40}  Outside the German mine-fields, and in any inshore areas which were unmined, German patrol craft would probably be stationed.  Patrol craft, in comparatively narrow waters, are effective for discovering the approach of surface vessels in clear weather by day or night.  The _minimum_ harm that they could do to the attacking force would be that of reporting the latter's approach.  A single alarm rocket might be sufficient.  It is, therefore, almost inconceivable that the patrol vessels could be passed without the alarm being given.  Any gun-firing would, of course, act as an alarm; ramming, a much more silent method, would be the best course open to the attacking craft if they encountered the patrols.  There were two other forms of patrol, however, which could provide even more serious obstacles.  Submarines, stationed on the route between the attacker's base and the objective, could patrol at periscope depth.  The passing of the squadrons, viewed through the periscope of the unseen submarine would be reported by wireless telegraphy immediately the submarine could come to the surface.  Thus, long before the attack commenced, the defenders would be perfectly well aware of the attacker's approach, whereas the latter would imagine that their mission was unsuspected.  This use of a submarine, as a lookout, would be of infinitely greater importance, in such an event as this, than her use as a torpedo vessel.  Aircraft patrolling off the coast--say at a height of five thousand feet--would be able to see as far as the southeast coast of England, provided the atmosphere were clear.  Under average conditions of {41} visibility there would be no difficulty in discovering a naval force several miles distant.  Such discovery would be immediately reported to the defences with the same result as that just described in the case of the submarine.  The Germans had a strong force of seaplanes based on the Flanders coast.  These machines were generally patrolling the vicinity--_provided the Allied aircraft were not about_.  [Sidenote: Summary of Obstacles]  We have now arrived at the stage where we can make a summary of the main obstacles in the way of a blocking enterprise at Zeebrugge.  There were (_a_) the aerial patrol; (_b_) outlying submarines; (_c_) surface patrol vessels; (_d_) mines; (_e_) uncharted shoals; (_f_) lack of navigational aids; (_g_) coast defence batteries and illuminating apparatus; (_h_) the guns on the Mole; (_i_) the obstruction booms; (_j_) the harbour defence craft; (_k_) the shore batteries defending the canal; (_l_) the difficulties of seamanship in a tideway; and lastly (_m_) the vagaries of the weather.  In connection with a blocking enterprise at Ostende the same obstacles applied with the exception of those resulting from the presence of the Mole.  The list is undoubtedly formidable _though not yet complete_.  The operation, on the face of it, did not seem to be altogether simple.  In writing this book I may be taken to task for concentrating on the operation at Zeebrugge and leaving the Ostende stories untold.  The latter operations, there were two, would necessitate a volume to themselves.  And--this is the all-important point--I am not competent to render a first-hand account of them because I was not in the position of an eye-witness.  Let us hope that the story {42} will be written some day, so that the splendid work of poor Godsal,[1] who afterwards lost his life at Ostende in my old ship, and of his gallant troop may be properly recorded.  [1] Commander A. E. Godsal.  Owing to the fact that we were uncertain as to the extent to which Ostende could be utilised as an exit from Bruges, we naturally decided to assume its efficiency; i.e., to assume that blocking the craft in at Bruges would necessitate blocking both Zeebrugge and Ostende.  The harbour entrance at Ostende was somewhat similar to the canal entrance at Zeebrugge.  There were two piers flanking the entrance channel, the whole area being commanded by shore batteries.  The only other comparison between the places which calls for mention here is as follows.  Whereas the Mole at Zeebrugge provided additional obstacles against entry, it also acted as a landmark from which the canal entrance could be found.  At Ostende the defence obstacles would be less complicated, but the harbour entrance would be more difficult to locate.  Now, the decision to block both exits naturally led to the conclusion that they should be blocked simultaneously if practicable.  Otherwise the operation at one place would serve as a warning to the other.  For instance, it would have been rather absurd for us to block Zeebrugge one night with a view to coming along on the following night to block Ostende.  The absurdity would have been only slightly less in degree if we blocked one exit at--say--midnight with the idea of blocking the other at 2 A.M.  For the defence batteries at the two places would naturally be in {43} telephonic communication, and even half an hour's notice at the second exit would be sufficient to prepare a very warm reception for us.  Simultaneous blocking was our aim; thus the whole operation was directed to that end, a fact which influenced the events to be related.  It has been suggested that \"blocking the exit\" was not the best method of preventing the egress of German vessels from the Zeebrugge canal. An alternative method, that of destroying the lock-gate by gun-fire, was referred to.  The idea sounds plausible enough at first.  As a matter of fact, many attempts had been made, by means of long-range bombardments, to achieve that end.  They had all failed.  The lock-gate appeared to have a charmed life.  Huge shell had burst in its vicinity and yet it still remained intact.  The suggestion was then put forward that the lock-gate should be bombarded _from close range_ under cover of smoke or gas.  This suggestion was accompanied by the opinion that an attempt at blocking the channel would be futile.  I am much puzzled at this idea of close bombardment.  For it was as obvious, as it was known to be a fact, that the Germans would withdraw the gate into its armoured recess immediately a bombardment was suspected.  This would have been the work of a few moments; the outer lock-gate would have been rendered absolutely immune from destruction.  The argument that there were two lock-gates, outer and inner, and that the Germans could not withdraw both, owing to the fear of the canal running dry, also sounds plausible until it is closely examined. Firstly, however, it is clear that the canal would only run dry if both lock-gates were opened _at low tide_; secondly, an {44} inshore operation at low tide would preclude the use of any craft other than those of shallow draught; thirdly, owing to the presence of the outer wall of the Mole, whose height would be over forty feet at low tide, the bombarding vessels could only obtain a direct line of fire at the lock from a position inside the Mole where the extensive shoals would allow very little room for manoeuvring, to say nothing of the defences on the Mole itself; fourthly, the canal, even if emptied, would refill from the rising tide within a few hours, and there was no certainty that the temporary evacuation of the water would cause serious damage; and lastly, one may assume, if there was really any substance in the idea, that the Vice-Admiral whose many long-range bombardments had failed to achieve their purpose would have long since attempted a short-range attack.  So, the decision to block the entrance at Zeebrugge having been reached, the best position for blocking had to be considered.  It has already been shown that the narrowest portion of the channel to seaward of the lock was situated near the shore ends of the wooden piers. Another position even narrower in size was that of the lock-gateway itself.  But the mere width of the position chosen was by no means the only consideration.  The actual sinking of the blockships in position did not provide the final argument; a point of great importance concerned the practicability of removing them out of the channel; it is of little use to block a channel in such a manner that it can easily be unblocked. This matter concerns the art of salvage.  Salvage is a highly technical subject, but a few {45} remarks at this stage are necessary if the reader is to appreciate the extent to which considerations of salvage affected the problem under discussion.  Salvage operations must vary according to the circumstances of each particular case.  The size of the vessel, the damage which she has sustained, the manner in which she is resting on the bottom of the sea, the nature of the ground, the tides, the depth of water, the degree of exposure to rough seas, the proximity of shelter for salvage craft, and the distance from the land are all factors of importance, but they by no means exhaust the list.  One of our main purposes in considering salvage"]]]
