His advice was not necessary, for no other letter was sent to me.  I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back to Jefferson Barracks, and I understood the reason without explanation from any one.  My leave of absence required me to report for duty, at Jefferson Barracks, at the end of twenty days.  I knew my regiment had gone up the Red River, but I was not disposed to break the letter of my leave; besides, if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct, I could not have reached there until after the expiration of my leave.  Accordingly, at the end of the twenty days, I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell, commanding at Jefferson Barracks, handing him at the same time my leave of absence.  After noticing the phraseology of the order--leaves of absence were generally worded, \"at the end of which time he will report for duty with his proper command\"--he said he would give me an order to join my regiment in Louisiana.  I then asked for a few days' leave before starting, which he readily granted.  This was the same Ewell who acquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during the rebellion.  He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the old army, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars --both in my estimation unholy.  I immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking no baggage with me, of course.  There is an insignificant creek--the Gravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going, and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth.  There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.  On this occasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I found the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.  I looked at it a moment to consider what to do.  One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.  I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in by the other side.  So I struck into the stream, and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the current.  I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it, wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.  I went on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my --future--brother-in-law.  We were not of the same size, but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own.  Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the most awkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the 4th infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks.  The young lady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had never looked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable to her, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account for when the regiment left.  Before separating it was definitely understood that at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let the removal of a regiment trouble us.  This was in May, 1844.  It was the 22d of August, 1848, before the fulfilment of this agreement.  My duties kept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation during the pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the war with Mexico, provoked by the action of the army, if not by the annexation itself. During that time there was a constant correspondence between Miss Dent and myself, but we only met once in the period of four years and three months.  In May, 1845, I procured a leave for twenty days, visited St. Louis, and obtained the consent of the parents for the union, which had not been asked for before.  As already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long, but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.  Accordingly, soon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks, I wrote a letter to Professor Church--Professor of Mathematics at West Point--requesting him to ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to be made. Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army, supposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particular branch of study they are assigned to teach.  The answer from Professor Church was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have been detailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on. Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued in garrison, with regularity, if not persistency.  I reviewed my West Point course of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks, and read many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.  To help my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time to time, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it.  When the regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effects were packed up by Lieutenant Haslett, of the 4th infantry, and taken along.  I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another, except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.  Often since a fear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall into the hands of some malicious person who would publish it.  I know its appearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthful horse-trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes.  The 3d infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at Fort Jessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine.  Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await further instructions.  Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pine woods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about three miles from each, and on high ground back from the river.  The place was given the name of Camp Salubrity, and proved entitled to it. The camp was on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, in front and rear.  The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water, and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in that region in great multitudes and of great voracity.  In the valley they swarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.  The regiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred, and that was caused by an accident.  There was no intimation given that the removal of the 3d and 4th regiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasioned in any way by the prospective annexation of Texas, but it was generally understood that such was the case. Ostensibly we were intended to prevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a menace to Mexico in case she appeared to contemplate war.  Generally the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; but not so all of them.  For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.  It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.  Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic of Mexico.  It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grande on the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to the territory of the United States and New Mexico--another Mexican state at that time--on the north and west.  An empire in territory, it had but a very sparse population, until settled by Americans who had received authority from Mexico to colonize. These colonists paid very little attention to the supreme government, and introduced slavery into the state almost from the start, though the constitution of Mexico did not, nor does it now, sanction that institution.  Soon they set up an independent government of their own, and war existed, between Texas and Mexico, in name from that time until 1836, when active hostilities very nearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican President. Before long, however, the same people--who with permission of Mexico had colonized Texas, and afterwards set up slavery there, and then seceded as soon as they felt strong enough to do so--offered themselves and the State to the United States, and in 1845 their offer was accepted.  The occupation, separation and annexation were, from the inception of the movement to its final consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territory out of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.  Even if the annexation itself could be justified, the manner in which the subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot.  The fact is, annexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay any claim to, as part of the new acquisition. Texas, as an independent State, never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico had never recognized the independence of Texas, and maintained that, even if independent, the State had no claim south of the Nueces.  I am aware that a treaty, made by the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress, ceded all the territory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande--, but he was a prisoner of war when the treaty was made, and his life was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4546"],["title","Memoirs of the Union's Three Great Civil War Generals (#6)"],["body"," jeopardy.  He knew, too, that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans, if they should ever capture him.  The Texans, if they had taken his life, would have only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few years before, when he executed the entire garrison of the Alamo and the villagers of Goliad.  In taking military possession of Texas after annexation, the army of occupation, under General Taylor, was directed to occupy the disputed territory.  The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiate for a settlement of the boundary question, but went beyond, apparently in order to force Mexico to initiate war.  It is to the credit of the American nation, however, that after conquering Mexico, and while practically holding the country in our possession, so that we could have retained the whole of it, or made any terms we chose, we paid a round sum for the additional territory taken; more than it was worth, or was likely to be, to Mexico.  To us it was an empire and of incalculable value; but it might have been obtained by other means.  The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.  Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.  The 4th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May, 1844, with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders.  At first, officers and men occupied ordinary tents.  As the summer heat increased these were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun.  The summer was whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visiting those stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away, visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore.  There was much pleasant intercourse between the inhabitants and the officers of the army.  I retain very agreeable recollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintances made there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers living who were there at the time.  I can call to mind only two officers of the 4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with the regiment, who are now alive.  With a war in prospect, and belonging to a regiment that had an unusual number of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, my hopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished.  At the time of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary's and adjutant--general's departments were appointed from the line of the army, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their regimental and staff commissions were for the same grades.  Generally lieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff corps.  If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived at a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they would retain.  In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers were on duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from the regiment.  Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special course of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, and not very much for that, until the war was over.  I kept a horse and rode, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirely recovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and from all indications of consumption.  I have often thought that my life was saved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by an administrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.  As summer wore away, and cool days and colder nights came upon us, the tents. We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters; and \"further orders\" not reaching us, we began to look about to remedy the hardship.  Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts, and in a very short time all were comfortably housed--privates as well as officers.  The outlay by the government in accomplishing this was nothing, or nearly nothing.  The winter was spent more agreeably than the summer had been.  There were occasional parties given by the planters along the \"coast\"--as the bottom lands on the Red River were called.  The climate was delightful.  Near the close of the short session of Congress of 1844-5, the bill for the annexation of Texas to the United States was passed.  It reached President Tyler on the 1st of March, 1845, and promptly received his approval.  When the news reached us we began to look again for \"further orders.\"  They did not arrive promptly, and on the 1st of May following I asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days, for the purpose of visiting--St. Louis.  The object of this visit has been before stated.  Early in July the long expected orders were received, but they only took the regiment to New Orleans Barracks.  We reached there before the middle of the month, and again waited weeks for still further orders. The yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remained there, and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuous well-observed Sunday.  I recollect but one occasion when this observance seemed to be broken by the inhabitants.  One morning about daylight I happened to be awake, and, hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off, I looked out to ascertain where the sound came from.  I observed a couple of clusters of men near by, and learned afterwards that \"it was nothing; only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinion with rifles, at twenty paces.\"  I do not remember if either was killed, or even hurt, but no doubt the question of difference was settled satisfactorily, and \"honorably,\" in the estimation of the parties engaged.  I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight a duel.  If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing to kill him, I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons with which it should be done, and of the time, place and distance separating us, when I executed him.  If I should do another such a wrong as to justify him in killing me, I would make any reasonable atonement within my power, if convinced of the wrong done.  I place my opposition to duelling on higher grounds than here stated.  No doubt a majority of the duels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of those engaged to decline.  At Camp Salubrity, and when we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4th infantry was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who had not commanded on drill for a number of years.  He was not a man to discover infirmity in the presence of danger.  It now appeared that war was imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics. Accordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took command of the regiment at a battalion drill.  Only two or three evolutions had been gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go to his own quarters, dropped dead.  He had not been complaining of ill health, but no doubt died of heart disease.  He was a most estimable man, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.    CHAPTER IV.  CORPUS CHRISTI--MEXICAN SMUGGLING--SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO--SUPPLYING TRANSPORTATION.  Early in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi, now in Texas.  Ocean steamers were not then common, and the passage was made in sailing vessels.  At that time there was not more than three feet of water in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay; the debarkation, therefore, had to take place by small steamers, and at an island in the channel called Shell Island, the ships anchoring some miles out from shore. This made the work slow, and as the army was only supplied with one or two steamers, it took a number of days to effect the landing of a single regiment with its stores, camp and garrison equipage, etc.  There happened to be pleasant weather while this was going on, but the land-swell was so great that when the ship and steamer were on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerable distance apart.  The men and baggage were let down to a point higher than the lower deck of the steamer, and when ship and steamer got into the trough between the waves, and were close together, the load would be drawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck.  After I had gone ashore, and had been on guard several days at Shell Island, quite six miles from the ship, I had occasion for some reason or other to return on board.  While on the Suviah--I think that was the name of our vessel--I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of the ship, and much and excited sailor language, such as \"damn your eyes,\" etc.  In a moment or two the captain, who was an excitable little man, dying with consumption, and not weighing much over a hundred pounds, came running out, carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as he was, and crying, that his men had mutinied.  It was necessary to sustain the captain without question, and in a few minutes all the sailors charged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish that I had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutiny submitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubted if they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.  By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learned enough of the working of the double and single pulley, by which passengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer below, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Without saying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, and taking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put one foot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did so some one called out \"hold on.\"  It was too late.  I tried to \"hold on\" with all my might, but my heels "]]]
