Instantly, he spotted a Nazi gun, mounted on a dune-rise, a silhouette of men and gun, the flare exploding behind the gunners. He shouted at Landel but a shell blew up beside the Sherman and hurled it half around. Dennison toppled from his seat--the air knocked out of his lungs.  He thought: We’re hit ... we’ll catch on fire!  Back at his controls, he cut the racing motor and wobbled out of the line of fire, Landel babbling incoherently over the intercom.  Another shell.  \"Port side ... port!\" Landel yelled.  The treads caught, slipped, jerked, the M4 flopping from side to side; the rumble of the treads, rolling unevenly, drowned the shellfire. Their grinding was like the beating of pneumatic hammers on metal sheets.  It seemed to the crew that the interior darkness became part of the noise, whirled around with it, cyclotronic, snagging thought and muscle.  Dennison’s signaller appeared and led the tank to a strip of packed sand behind a lofty dune; he leaned forward to relieve a cramp in his side and wet his lips with his tongue, craving a drink. A shell boomed.  The signaller said _stop_.  They’re waiting for dawn, Dennison thought.  I’ve got to rest a little ... got to have some water.  Unable to speak, he tapped Landel’s shoulder and indicated his mouth: lights in the cab flickered on Landel’s face, his twisting lips.  \"Okay,\" Dennison heard on the phone.  As he drank and sensed the cool decency of water, he was afraid, afraid he would never have another drink, never get out, never have a chance to walk through fields or woods, stoop to cup water from a stream ...  The darkness, the waiting, the crash of shells, the steel: it was both pain and the unknown.  His hand shook as he gave the canteen to Landel.... Strange, dark inside but growing light outside.  He had wandered through a low ceilinged cave as a boy, on the heels of a guy who carried a dim lantern ... this was another cave, a cave that moved.  He shivered from the heat and his dripping sweat. Sweat trickled along his arms, down the inside of his forearms and into his palms.  With his port visor open he watched the dawn: it would soon free him from the signaller’s microscopic dot.  He wet his lips with his tongue and eased against his seat.  Someone was jabbering on the phone; the radio was wheezing instructions; Landel was yelling ...  The quiet was uncanny, no motor running, no shellfire: Dennison knew that he dozed: he glanced at his wristwatch nervously; he glanced through his slit across the desert, across slab after slab of unfamiliar ground where yellow light exposed columns of dust: tanks or trucks were there, rolling north: dust, sand, heat, rolling heat, rolling sand and dust.  Zinc was talking to Chuck on the phone.  \"There’s our signal!\" Landel yelled.  \"Let’s go,\" Chuck called.  A shell dumped a spout of sand that became a ragged blur, it was grey inside the tank now; the faces of the crew were grey; grey clouds hung in the morning light.  Zinc was thinking of Ohio, dawdling on a quiet elm street; Millard was shoving at the gum around a painful tooth: the thing had to be extracted.  Fred Landel had his palms palmed over his eyes, his brain shut out; Chuck had thrown his shirt around his shoulders, knotted the sleeves around his neck.  Dennison jockeyed the engine, thinking:  If I could go to Bizerte and lie in bed and sleep ... could write a letter ... I should ...  He felt the treads digging in; they tossed sand to the rear; the bus rolled through a wadi, climbed into the sun that was burning ahead. Something in the rocking motion, the rise and fall, made him feel that he was driving over the bodies of wounded men.  He seemed to see across treeless fields, across horizons, across Africa, across Europe, across Asia--into a snowland: there was time to ride through forests, time to ski ...  Shell flames seared his thoughts.  He wanted to swing back, put the Sherman into reverse, turn, rush toward the rear--retreat.  He wanted to open a steel door, jump out, run, blunder away from the din, away from the stench of gas and oil.  Landel scribbled something on his knee pad and handed it to Dennison. As Landel yelled on the radio transmitter, Dennison bent over the scrawl and forced his brain to come together and make sense:  _Entering Anadi--Armed Corps_.  What was Anadi?  Dennison had to jerk his machine away from an abutment of rocks; then it was smooth going: he shot the bus into faster gear: they were rolling at forty: they got to fifty, the heat mounting, billowing.  They were in formation with other tanks in their Corps.  Visibility: a hundred miles.  Blank sand.  Rolling.  He heard somebody open fire with a machine gun: it was Zinc: then their 75 pounder whammed into action.  Landel signalled _slow_.  Dennison observed a tank to starboard, tank inside a cloud of dust and sand; the tank began zigzagging; the machine on the port side was driving straight ahead.  He opened his visors to better vision.  For seconds he watched his compass dial.  North-north east ...  Chickens flapped wildly along a street.  Anadi, appearing out of sand, was a cluster of mud huts, brick huts, doors sagging on leather hinges, scraped white walls, white roosters, bashed dome, a toppling minaret, more Libyan dust. From a brick compound, pierced by a jagged hole, a cannon fired at the Sherman, spreading smoke and yeasty light into the street.  A radio tower, designed like a potato masher, appeared through smoke and dust.  A shell made the Sherman swivel.  Lights failed inside.  Dennison rolled forward slowly.  The lights went on. Dennison had a moment to catch a glimpse of tiled roofs, barred windows, a bleached garden with broken benches, a dead woman. A pair of dogs dove through an open doorway.  The door shut.  Where was the cannon, firing out of the compound? Dennison coaxed his bus over cobbles, over a low barricade, close to a white wall; there a poster displayed a veiled woman, smiling. God, he thought, are there really women here?  Maybe I can get a drink ... rest ... maybe ... maybe eat ...  Smoke choked the street, brown smoke, acrid: it filled the space from house to house, street side to street side: it seemed to be working its way between the cobbles.  Dennison’s eyes slid over his indicators, oil gauge, gas gauge, temperature, compass, ammeter, water gauge.  He tried to remember how many of their tanks were supposed to converge on Anadi but a shell crashed on the thought: he held his mouth open, expecting another detonation.  The treads scrambled over bricks, smashed a door, travelled on paving, zigzagged, knocked down fence posts.  The ventilation fan seemed to have stopped.  Dust increased.  It was steel, desert, shells, more steel.  Can’t see through the goddamn dust ... why doesn’t it clear up? Christ, how my shoulders ache!  What have they got in this rotten little town that we need so badly?  Twenty tanks, thirty tanks in this town ...  Now, now I can see.  Okay, we push ahead ... okay go ...  A streetcar lay on its side--broken glass everywhere.  Every house window was shuttered.  Doors had been boarded over, were padlocked or x’d with planking as if the war could be shut out. White flags fluttered on roof tops--dirty white rags.  Sandbags, with Egyptian lettering on them, leaned against an iron fence that leaned against a damaged truck. Nazi dead lay on paths in a circular rose bed, flowers tangled around their arms and legs, around rifles and helmets.  Flowers.  Bushes.  A lifeless dog lay in front of the Sherman and reminded Dennison of a dog he had owned in E, a brown dog: here Tubby, here Tubby.  Dog eager to lick your hands and grin.  Cocker.  Here Tubby.  The treads of the tank spun over gravel: Zinc’s machine gun destroyed an emplacement on a roof: Millard’s gun mowed down three men, rushing along an alley.  Landel signalled and they rumbled along another alley and the cannon blew apart the front of a store where Nazi gunners were firing.  Above a dome, perhaps a mosque, a shell burst, hurling bricks and stucco over doors, the Sherman and along a street.  Dennison jazzed the bus down a wide street and townspeople fled ... ten or twelve on one side, bunched together, men and women, their clothing white and blue; their turbans white.  Landel swung his machine gun to kill them: several dropped, a youngster, a boy, stumbled into the gutter, and lay there.  Spitting on the tank wall, Landel cursed them:  You goddamn sons of bitches ... why the hell are you out in the street ... don’t you know no better?  Even with all the ports open the air inside the cab writhed.  Gun powder stung their eyes and throats.  The crewmen’s faces were haunted.  They stared out of ports and slits, leered, grimaced, mad, incredulous, exhausted, hungry, thirsty, deaf.  Dennison saw the sun directly ahead as the prow wrenched upward ...  Somewhere, sometime, he must do something about the sky, study it, understand its composition, figure out how it originated, whether it altered at night, how it was influenced by storms, changes in temperature.  Only a week ago Al had died on one of the morning attacks: Landel had bellowed through the intercom: he had seen Al crash onto the floor: they had wanted to lug him outside, into the air, but he had died in Dennison’s arms, his head saturated with blood, a bullet in his brain.  Yeah, Al had liked the sky.  They had talked about it.  He liked the sun.  Al had wanted to buy a farm, have some horses and a cow. Horses not cars.  He had talked about horses at camp: they had been buddies at Camp Manley.  Yeah, they had put in days together, fishing at a nearby pond, hiking through Texas fields ... bluebonnets....  Dennison observed other tanks: M3’s and M4’s, on a side street, the machines parked one behind the other, the crews still inside.  A signal Corps flag appeared in the doorway of a two story building.  A Corps flag wagged on a roof.  Dennison drove his bus into a treeless square, and stopped, settled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44717"],["title","Forward, Children! (#5)"],["body","into his seat, and asked Landel for the canteen.  As he drank, he read Landel’s scrawl:  _Stay!_  In another section of Anadi, shells were gutting, lofting smoke, sand and dust.  The canteen water sent a chill through Dennison; a fleck of London hovered behind his eyes, streets with trees, fog, people waiting for a double-decker, kids leaning over a bridge rail, Big Ben, the grey Thames flowing ... he thought of Al again: Al had been twenty-three, a graduate of Western Reserve: the bullet had torn his ...  Landel checked the gas gauge.  Okay, gasoline.  Suddenly, they were off, a tank almost in front of Dennison, a tank toward the rear.  At the first intersection, they separated, to mop up. A barricade had been erected on a street between low, white walls; there were trees to one side, delicate plumes of tamarisk, tamarisk in a row--trying to beat the desert and its heat.  Again every window was shuttered, even second floor windows.  Grey shutters.  Mauled shutters.  Paintless.  Nobody was defending the barricade.  The treads moaned over sandbags and piles of masonry.  As Dennison topped the barricade a Nazi tank opened fire, firing head-on, a squad of infantrymen armed with Brens squeezed together behind it.  The tank’s swastika burned in Dennison’s brain: he spun his bus to the left, increased speed, shot ahead, cut to the right; he yelled through the intercom to Chuck, ordering him to open fire. Chuck’s 75-pounder boomed.  Dennison tried to signal Landel but grew confused.  Why was the Nazi tank motionless?  Was it some sort of trick?  Again he swung his tank to one side and then spurted forward as fast as she would roll.  If the commander of the German bus was stalling, what the hell was he figuring?  Chuck steadied his gun--his body a part of it: steady boy, steady. Look, the Nazi turret is revolving.  Wait, Chuck heard Landel’s command to let go.  As Dennison pivoted the Sherman, he pulled the trigger.  The 75 pounder hit the Nazi prow and threw the tank to one side. Millard fed another shell to Chuck.  The Nazi dropped a shell behind the Sherman: it exploded so close its force threw Landel to the floor. Smoke drenched the ports.  Chuck’s gunfire tore open the Panther’s armor plate and ripped off a tread and port gun--gapping the machine.  The infantrymen, with their Brens, froze: they still expected help from their smashed tank: they signalled each other and began to fan out as Dennison stared, his bus motionless.  The sun was beating down: the smoke was clearing: dust was rolling up from somewhere: pigeons flew low: like a Hollywood prop the antenna mast on the Panther bent, and then collapsed onto the cobbles.  Landel was first to come to:  He whirled his machine gun on the half petrified infantrymen: he was too fast and depressed the barrel and bullets clattered across cobbles and rubble.  Some of the soldiers crouched behind the tank. Others ran.  A man fell.  Then no soldiers: they had melted away.  Dennison tried to follow them and then returned to the square where other M4’s were parked, near a small stone fountain and several olive trees.  Now, he thought ... I can rest ... get outside ... some water ... wet my face ... walk ... eat ...  Egging himself outside, he stumbled to the fountain where GI’s were standing, and splashed water on his face; removing his helmet, he splashed his head, staring into the shallow white tiled pool.  A single fish was swimming: or was it a trick of the mind? Alive?  Or coloration? And that bubble: were there still bubbles in the world?  He splashed his face again, the tank forgotten.  Water, air, trees, a grey-grey something, a gnarled something!  A lizard scuttled up a branch, stopped, flicked its tail, puffed its body, and stared inquisitively.  A cat slunk out of a bombed house and crossed the square and brushed against a GI, meowing, wobbling.  \"I’ll be damned ... a mangy cat,\" croaked Zinc, his hands in the fountain: he flopped water over his face and soaked his shirt.  Dennison heard Zinc’s words faintly: it would be hours before the tank deafness wore off.  More crewmen milled around, jostling, swearing.  A fat guy pounded Landel on his back as though he had won the war: he had seen Landel’s bus knock out the Nazi machine.  Landel pointed overhead.  Planes roared by; low on the horizon, a dozen Fortresses crawled through a dusty sky.  Dennison picked up the cat and stroked it.  As the line of men washed and drank, a boy scuttled from one of the houses, carrying a clay bottle of water: he offered it to the men nervously, speaking French, talking jerkily, as if something had injured his tongue.  He could not get it into his head that the crewmen were temporarily deaf; his mother had told him they might not understand his French; he thought that was the trouble.  Dennison drank from his bottle--cool, cool.  He explained that the Corpsmen were deaf; then, as Dennison handed back the bottle, the boy began to shout and point: he indicated the roof of one of the buildings across the square.  \"Look, Monsieur ... look, on the roof ... the roof of the mayor’s house! See!  There’s machine gun ... it’s pointed this way!  Maybe somebody can ... see, the gun is moving ... they’re getting ready.\"  Dennison had difficulty understanding the boy’s jargon; when he got it straight he yelled at the nearest crewmen.  The warning spread.  Someone at the fountain, a skinny guy in oily jeans, raced across the square and lobbed a grenade.  It fell short.  At once the gunmen fired.  A bullet chipped Dennison’s arm, and the waterboy dropped, Millard fell, slumping heavily against the basin of the fountain; the cat scampered for shelter, leaves fell from the olive trees.  Seconds later, another grenade wiped out the roof gun and gunners ... planes roared overhead ... Millard was dead; the water-boy lay motionless ... Zinc began bandaging Dennison’s arm.  Two minutes, or was it three?  Or five?  \"It’s nothing,\" Dennison objected.  \"I’m okay.  We’d better see about the kid.\"  \"I know it’s not bad ... a nick.  Hold still!\" Zinc yelled.  They were crouched alongside the fountain, Zinc’s first aid kit on the rim.  Millard faced the olive trees and the many ripped off leaves around him.  Dennison thought that his face had become years older: oil had spattered his chin.  His lowered lip sagged, exposing his missing teeth.  Landel was bending over him, checking for his ID, his dog tag. Landel’s greasy bald head filled Dennison with great bitterness: it said:  Here we are, who cares!  In Africa, who cares!  Who will bury us?  The waterboy was moving.  \"Hold still,\" Zinc commanded.  \"Now there are only four of us to crew our tank,\" Dennison yelled.  \"So what!\" Zinc yelled.  \"Four of us,\" Dennison repeated.  \"We can manage, Chuck is good.\"  Dennison wondered what Millard’s wife was like: had she loved the guy or was the beneficiary sum worth far more?  His hands trembled: death was such a crappy business.  In Ohio death wasn’t like this!  In Ohio, there were preachers, graves with names and dates on them.  When Zinc had taped his arm they carried the waterboy, carried him into a house across the square, banging on a door, shoving him inside when two women opened.  A bullet had smashed his leg.  The kid moaned and flopped his arms.  He was bleeding badly.  Dennison liked his bright face, his gaunt, nomadic build.  He respected his courage: that business with the water bottle, the spotting of the roof gunners.  Kneeling and sitting on the tiled floor of someone’s living room he and Zinc did their best to bandage the boy’s leg. Dennison tried to talk to him but he couldn’t come to. People crowded around, yapping, yapping: he saw their mouths going.  Speaking French he yelled at a woman:  \"Try to locate a Red Cross man!\"  The veiled figure hovered over the boy, her blue boubous was flecked with something white.  \"Médecin,\" she mumbled.  Dennison and Zinc risked a third of their stock of bandages: they rebound the break, padding it.  \"Good boy, good boy,\" Dennison said to himself. \"Nice kid, nice kid!\" Zinc said.  According to Landel, the Anadi mess was a mere delaying action, a hinge in the Nazi retreat.  Millard was left, to be trucked to a base.  The tanks gulped water.  A supply tank furnished gas and oil.  Landel, Zinc and Chuck and Dennison worked steadily, with a few minutes for food.  Where’s the thermos?  Where’s the coffee?  Cigarettes?  God, thought Dennison, where now?  A radio screamed: _Advance to Beramet_.  A merchant, with a yellow and blue turban on his head, was opening a double door, a pack of dates lay on his table, a girl was prostrate on a cot, two camels appeared, a pigeon flew.  There was no opportunity to remember the olive trees: Dennison shut his eyes: he belched and swayed in his seat: the hatch banged shut, was bolted shut: he shifted his controls ... Remember?  His arm stung where the bullet had nicked him; he minded the heat; already the roaring of the tank had lost some of its noise: he was growing deafer.  Over the intercom--far away--he heard Landel:  \"There’s a concrete pillbox ahead!\"  Why the hell should we knock it out!  Whose pillbox was it? Why was it there?  Where was the damn artillery?  Asleep!  Must be some other M4’s around!  Or an M18!  Maybe the rest of the Corps was lost on the desert--in some hellish place.  Thoroughly angry, swiping sweat from his face, he decelerated to 5 mph.  Let some other bastard wipe out the pillbox!  Landel indicated starboard and they swung close to a brick wall, snailed along it, rounded a corner, and there, near a chapel, was the pillbox, white, dirty, plastered with faded movie posters. Before Dennison could shift gears the crew in the box let go and a shell blew bricks out of the wall and shrapnel crashed against their armor plate.  Landel signalled.  Dennison bent forward in his seat and wet his lips with his tongue, and felt the blood flow from his head: he thought: going to conk out.  Must have canteen, soak my"]]]
