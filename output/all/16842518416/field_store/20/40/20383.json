Her fingers touched the cold gun--grasped with thrill on thrill--slipped farther down, strong and sure to raise the hammer. Then with a leaping, strung intensity that matched his own she drew the gun. She raised it while her eyes were shut. She lay passive under his kisses--the devouring kisses of one whose manhood had been denied the sweetness, the glory, the fire, the life of woman's lips. It was a moment in which she met his primitive fury of possession with a woman's primitive fury of profanation. She pressed the gun against his side and pulled the trigger.  A thundering, muffled, hollow boom! The odor of burned powder stung her nostrils. Kells's hold on her tightened convulsively, loosened with strange, lessening power. She swayed back free of him, still with tight-shut eyes. A horrible cry escaped him--a cry of mortal agony. It wrenched her. And she looked to see him staggering amazed, stricken, at bay, like a wolf caught in cruel steel jaws. His hands came away from both sides, dripping with blood. They shook till the crimson drops spattered on the wall, on the boughs. Then he seemed to realize and he clutched at her with these bloody hands.  “God Almighty!” he panted. “You shot me!... You--you girl!... You she-cat... You knew--all the time... You she-cat!... Give me--that gun!”  “Kells, get back! I'll kill you!” she cried. The big gun, outstretched between them, began to waver.  Kells did not see the gun. In his madness he tried to move, to reach her, but he could not; he was sinking. His legs sagged under him, let him down to his knees, and but for the wall he would have fallen. Then a change transformed him. The black, turgid, convulsed face grew white and ghastly, with beads of clammy sweat and lines of torture. His strange eyes showed swiftly passing thought--wonder, fear, scorn--even admiration.  “Joan, you've done--for me!” he gasped. “You've broken my back!... It'll kill me! Oh the pain--the pain! And I can't stand pain! You--you girl! You innocent seventeen-year-old girl! You that couldn't hurt any creature! You so tender--so gentle!... Bah! you fooled me. The cunning of a woman! I ought--to know. A good woman's--more terrible than a--bad woman.... But I deserved this. Once I used--to be.... Only, the torture!... Why didn't you--kill me outright?... Joan--Randle--watch me--die! Since I had--to die--by rope or bullet--I'm glad you--you--did for me.... Man or beast--I believe--I loved you!”  Joan dropped the gun and sank beside him, helpless, horror-stricken, wringing her hands. She wanted to tell him she was sorry, that he drove her to it, that he must let her pray for him. But she could not speak. Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth and she seemed strangling.  Another change, slower and more subtle, passed over Kells. He did not see Joan. He forgot her. The white shaded out of his face, leaving a gray like that of his somber eyes. Spirit, sense, life, were fading from him. The quivering of a racked body ceased. And all that seemed left was a lonely soul groping on the verge of the dim borderland between life and death. Presently his shoulders slipped along the wall and he fell, to lie limp and motionless before Joan. Then she fainted.     6  When Joan returned to consciousness she was lying half outside the opening of the cabin and above her was a drift of blue gun-smoke, slowly floating upward. Almost as swiftly as perception of that smoke came a shuddering memory. She lay still, listening. She did not hear a sound except the tinkle and babble and gentle rush of the brook. Kells was dead, then. And overmastering the horror of her act was a relief, a freedom, a lifting of her soul out of the dark dread, a something that whispered justification of the fatal deed.  She got up and, avoiding to look within the cabin, walked away. The sun was almost at the zenith. Where had the morning hours gone?  “I must get away,” she said, suddenly. The thought quickened her. Down the canon the horses were grazing. She hurried along the trail, trying to decide whether to follow this dim old trail or endeavor to get out the way she had been brought in. She decided upon the latter. If she traveled slowly, and watched for familiar landmarks, things she had seen once, and hunted carefully for the tracks, she believed she might be successful. She had the courage to try. Then she caught her pony and led him back to camp.  “What shall I take?” she pondered. She decided upon very little--a blanket, a sack of bread and meat, and a canteen of water. She might need a weapon, also. There was only one, the gun with which she had killed Kells. It seemed utterly impossible to touch that hateful thing. But now that she had liberated herself, and at such cost, she must not yield to sentiment. Resolutely she started for the cabin, but when she reached it her steps were dragging. The long, dull-blue gun lay where she had dropped it. And out of the tail of averted eyes she saw a huddled shape along the wall. It was a sickening moment when she reached a shaking hand for the gun. And at that instant a low moan transfixed her.  She seemed frozen rigid. Was the place already haunted? Her heart swelled in her throat and a dimness came before her eyes. But another moan brought a swift realization--Kells was alive. And the cold, clamping sickness, the strangle in her throat, all the feelings of terror, changed and were lost in a flood of instinctive joy. He was not dead. She had not killed him. She did not have blood on her hands. She was not a murderer.  She whirled to look at him. There he lay, ghastly as a corpse. And all her woman's gladness fled. But there was compassion left to her, and, forgetting all else, she knelt beside him. He was as cold as stone. She felt no stir, no beat of pulse in temple or wrist. Then she placed her ear against his breast. His heart beat weakly.  “He's alive,” she whispered. “But--he's dying.... What shall I do?”  Many thoughts flashed across her mind. She could not help him now; he would be dead soon; she did not need to wait there beside him; there was a risk of some of his comrades riding into that rendezvous. Suppose his back was not broken after all! Suppose she stopped the flow of blood, tended him, nursed him, saved his life? For if there were one chance of his living, which she doubted, it must be through her. Would he not be the same savage the hour he was well and strong again? What difference could she make in such a nature? The man was evil. He could not conquer evil. She had been witness to that. He had driven Roberts to draw and had killed him. No doubt he had deliberately and coldly murdered the two ruffians, Bill and Halloway, just so he could be free of their glances at her and be alone with her. He deserved to die there like a dog.  What Joan Randle did was surely a woman's choice. Carefully she rolled Kells over. The back of his vest and shirt was wet with blood. She got up to find a knife, towel, and water. As she returned to the cabin he moaned again.  Joan had dressed many a wound. She was not afraid of blood. The difference was that she had shed it. She felt sick, but her hands were firm as she cut open the vest and shirt, rolled them aside, and bathed his back. The big bullet had made a gaping wound, having apparently gone through the small of his back. The blood still flowed. She could not tell whether or not Kell's spine was broken, but she believed that the bullet had gone between bone and muscle, or had glanced. There was a blue welt just over his spine, in line with the course of the wound. She tore her scarf into strips and used it for compresses and bandages. Then she laid him back upon a saddle-blanket. She had done all that was possible for the present, and it gave her a strange sense of comfort. She even prayed for his life, and, if that must go, for his soul. Then she got up. He was unconscious, white, death-like. It seemed that his torture, his near approach to death, had robbed his face of ferocity, of ruthlessness, and of that strange amiable expression. But then, his eyes, those furnace-windows, were closed.  Joan waited for the end to come. The afternoon passed and she did not leave the cabin. It was possible that he might come to and want water. She had once administered to a miner who had been fatally crushed in an avalanche; and never could forget his husky call for water and the gratitude in his eyes.  Sunset, twilight, and night fell upon the canon. And she began to feel solitude as something tangible. Bringing saddle and blankets into the cabin, she made a bed just inside, and, facing the opening and the stars, she lay down to rest, if not to sleep. The darkness did not keep her from seeing the prostrate figure of Kells. He lay there as silent as if he were already dead. She was exhausted, weary for sleep, and unstrung. In the night her courage fled and she was frightened at shadows. The murmuring of insects seemed augmented into a roar; the mourn of wolf and scream of cougar made her start; the rising wind moaned like a lost spirit. Dark fancies beset her. Troop on troop of specters moved out of the black night, assembling there, waiting for Kells to join them. She thought she was riding homeward over the back trail, sure of her way, remembering every rod of that rough travel, until she got out of the mountains, only to be turned back by dead men. Then fancy and dream, and all the haunted gloom of canon and cabin, seemed slowly to merge into one immense blackness.  The sun, rimming the east wall, shining into Joan's face, awakened her. She had slept hours. She felt rested, stronger. Like the night, something dark had passed away from her. It did not seem strange to her that she should feel that Kells still lived. She knew it. And examination proved her right. In him there had been no change except that he had ceased to bleed. There was just a flickering of life in him, manifest"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45531"],["title","Narrative of the Life and Travels of Serjeant B—— (#0)"],["body","(http://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made available by Internet Archive (https://archive.org)    Note: Images of the original pages are available through       Internet Archive.

NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF SERJEANT B----.  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.  \"Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\"  \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.\"        Edinburgh:  Printed for David Brown, 16, South St. Andrew's Street; Chalmers and Collins, Glasgow; Knight & Lacey, 24, Paternoster-Row, London.  1823.  Printed by Balfour and Clarke, Edinburgh, 1823.     ADVERTISEMENT.   In justice to the unpretending Author of this volume, it is necessary to notice that the idea of publishing it in no respect originated with himself. The circumstances which led to its appearance may be very briefly stated.  On the Serjeant's arrival in this country from India, he found himself surrounded by an extensive circle of relations, to which the excellence of his own character soon added many personal friends. As might be expected, the occurrences of his past life and travels, frequently formed the topics of conversation at their occasional meetings; and as he had from an early period, for his own amusement and edification, been in the habit of keeping an exact journal of all \"the providences that befel him,\" he frequently had recourse to it for the purpose of aiding his recollection, and exhibiting more vividly the state of his feelings at various periods, and under the various incidents of his life. Many passages of the Journal excited a very pleasing and deep interest in those to whom they were communicated, and the desire of perusing it gradually extended itself to persons in a higher condition of life. A clergyman particularly, under whose pastoral care he was for some time placed, was so much struck with the interesting, as well as the instructive character of these \"simple annals,\" that he urged the Author, in a very kind but pressing manner, to collect the more material passages in the original Journal into something like a continued narrative; and to transcribe them in a connected and legible form, for the private enjoyment of his particular friends. Our Author, to whom nothing is more agreeable than to have his mind or hands usefully occupied, undertook the task, and executed it with a degree of neatness, which would have done great credit to a more practised scribe. The manuscript volume was, of course, in very great request in his own neighbourhood, and was perused by none without peculiar pleasure; but, for several years, no idea of printing it presented itself to his own mind, though it was frequently suggested by those who had been permitted to read it. It lately fell into the hands of the writer of this notice, whose feelings in perusing it certainly were those of extreme delight; and finding that one or two friends, in whose judgment he placed the highest confidence, coincided with him in opinion, he strongly recommended to the Author that it should be published. His reluctance to this public appearance, was only overcome through the influence of a suggestion rising up in his own mind, that the work might not only perhaps afford pleasure and instruction, but that, should any profits arise from the sale, he would be enabled thereby to gratify his feelings, by devoting them to the support of Bible and Missionary Societies, or other pious purposes.  The task of the Editor, while the sheets were passing through the press, has been of a very limited kind, being chiefly confined to the correction of a few _glaring_ errors in grammar or style, which the writer's very imperfect education necessarily occasioned. Though the most perfect liberty was conceded to him, the Editor felt no disposition to make any changes affecting that extreme naïveté and simplicity of style which appeared to form at least one peculiar and novel charm in the original narrative.  The Editor abstains from any attempt to characterize the volume, as he feels that, from peculiar circumstances, he has become too much enamoured of the Author and his performance, to possess the requisite coolness for doing the work strict justice. He now sends it into the world, humbly trusting that the same kind Providence that watched over the Author, amid manifold perils, temptations, and afflictions, will furnish him with fresh motives of gratitude, by rendering these his humble labours useful for promoting the glory of God, as well as profitable and acceptable to his \"dear readers\"--objects more precious, the Editor firmly believes, to _his_ soul, \"than thousands of gold and silver.\"  EDINBURGH,  _April 17, 1823_.
