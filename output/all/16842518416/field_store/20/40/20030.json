Finding the machine disposed to work accurately, Rob left the buccaneers to swim to the ship in the best way they could, while he dropped down to the deck again and recovered from the cabin his box of tablets and the electric tube.  The fellows were just scrambling on board when he again escaped, shooting into the air with considerable speed.  Indeed, the instrument now worked better than at any time since he had reached the cannibal island, and the boy was greatly delighted.  The wind at first sent him spinning away to the south, but he continued to rise until he was above the air currents, and the storm raged far beneath him.  Then he set the indicator to the northwest and breathlessly waited to see if it would obey.  Hurrah! away he sped at a fair rate of speed, while all his anxiety changed to a feeling of sweet contentment.  His success had greatly surprised him, but he concluded that the jar caused by dropping the instrument had relieved the pressure upon the works, and so helped rather than harmed the free action of the electric currents.  While he moved through the air with an easy, gliding motion he watched with much interest the storm raging below.  Above his head the sun was peacefully shining and the contrast was strange and impressive.  After an hour or so the storm abated, or else he passed away from it, for the deep blue of the ocean again greeted his eyes.  He dropped downward until he was about a hundred feet above the water, when he continued his northwesterly course.  But now he regretted having interfered for a moment with the action of the machine, for his progress, instead of being swift as a bird's flight, became slow and jerky, nor was he sure that the damaged machine might not break down altogether at any moment.  Yet so far his progress was in the right direction, and he resolved to experiment no further with the instrument, but to let it go as it would, so long as it supported him above the water.  However irregular the motion might be, it was sure, if continued, to bring him to land in time, and that was all he cared about just then.  When night fell his slumber was broken and uneasy, for he wakened more than once with a start of fear that the machine had broken and he was falling into the sea.  Sometimes he was carried along at a swift pace, and again the machine scarcely worked at all; so his anxiety was excusable.  The following day was one of continued uneasiness for the boy, who began to be harrassed by doubts as to whether, after all, he was moving in the right direction.  The machine had failed at one time in this respect and it might again.  He had lost all confidence in its accuracy.  In spite of these perplexities Rob passed the second night of his uneven flight in profound slumber, being exhausted by the strain and excitement he had undergone.  When he awoke at daybreak, he saw, to his profound delight, that he was approaching land.  The rising sun found him passing over a big city, which he knew to be Boston.  He did not stop.  The machine was so little to be depended upon that he dared make no halt.  But he was obliged to alter the direction from northwest to west, and the result of this slight change was so great a reduction in speed that it was mid-day before he saw beneath him the familiar village in which he lived.  Carefully marking the location of his father's house, he came to a stop directly over it, and a few moments later he managed to land upon the exact spot in the back yard whence he had taken his first successful flight.     7.  The Demon Becomes Angry   When Rob had been hugged and kissed by his mother and sisters, and even Mr. Joslyn had embraced him warmly, he gave them a brief account of his adventures.  The story was received with many doubtful looks and much grave shaking of heads, as was quite natural under the circumstances.  \"I hope, my dear son,\" said the father, \"that you have now passed through enough dangers to last you a lifetime, so that hereafter you will be contented to remain at home.\"  \"Oh, Robert!\" cried his mother, with tears in her loving eyes, \"you don't know how we've all worried about you for the past week!\"  \"A week?\" asked Rob, with surprise.  \"Yes; it's a week to-morrow morning since you flew into the air and disappeared.\"  \"Then,\" said the boy, thoughtfully, \"I've reached home just in time.\"  \"In time for what?\" she asked.  But he did not answer that question.  He was thinking of the Demon, and that on the afternoon of this very day he might expect the wise and splendid genius to visit him a second time.  At luncheon, although he did not feel hungry, he joined the family at the table and pleased his mother by eating as heartily as of old.  He was surprised to find how good the food tasted, and to realize what a pleasure it is to gratify one's sense of taste.  The tablets were all right for a journey, he thought, but if he always ate them he would be sure to miss a great deal of enjoyment, since there was no taste to them at all.  At four o'clock he went to his workshop and unlocked the door. Everything was exactly as he had left it, and he looked at his simple electrical devices with some amusement.  They seemed tame beside the wonders now in his possession; yet he recollected that his numerous wires had enabled him to strike the Master Key, and therefore should not be despised.  Before long he noticed a quickening in the air, as if it were suddenly surcharged with electric fluid, and the next instant, in a dazzling flash of light, appeared the Demon.  \"I am here!\" he announced.  \"So am I,\" answered Rob.  \"But at one time I really thought I should never see you again.  I've been--\"  \"Spare me your history,\" said the Demon, coldly.  \"I am aware of your adventures.\"  \"Oh, you are!\" said Rob, amazed.  \"Then you know--\"  \"I know all about your foolish experiences,\" interrupted the Demon, \"for I have been with you constantly, although I remained invisible.\"  \"Then you know what a jolly time I've had,\" returned the boy.  \"But why do you call them foolish experiences?\"  \"Because they were, abominably foolish!\" retorted the Demon, bitterly. \"I entrusted to you gifts of rare scientific interest--electrical devices of such utility that their general adoption by mankind would create a new era in earth life.  I hoped your use of these devices would convey such hints to electrical engineers that they would quickly comprehend their mechanism and be able to reproduce them in sufficient quantities to supply the world.  And how do you treat these marvelous gifts?  Why, you carry them to a cannibal island, where even your crude civilization has not yet penetrated!\"  \"I wanted to astonish the natives,\" said Rob, grinning.  The Demon uttered an exclamation of anger, and stamped his foot so fiercely that thousands of electric sparks filled the air, to disappear quickly with a hissing, crinkling sound.  \"You might have astonished those ignorant natives as easily by showing them an ordinary electric light,\" he cried, mockingly.  \"The power of your gifts would have startled the most advanced electricians of the world.  Why did you waste them upon barbarians?\"  \"Really,\" faltered Rob, who was frightened and awed by the Demon's vehement anger, \"I never intended to visit a cannibal island.  I meant to go to Cuba.\"  \"Cuba!  Is that a center of advanced scientific thought?  Why did you not take your marvels to New York or Chicago; or, if you wished to cross the ocean, to Paris or Vienna?\"  \"I never thought of those places,\" acknowledged Rob, meekly.  \"Then you were foolish, as I said,\" declared the Demon, in a calmer tone.  \"Can you not realize that it is better to be considered great by the intelligent thinkers of the earth, than to be taken for a god by stupid cannibals?\"  \"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Rob.  \"I wish now that I had gone to Europe. But you're not the only one who has a kick coming,\" he continued. \"Your flimsy traveling machine was nearly the death of me.\"  \"Ah, it is true,\" acknowledged the Demon, frankly.  \"The case was made of too light material.  When the rim was bent it pressed against the works and impeded the proper action of the currents.  Had you gone to a civilized country such an accident could not have happened; but to avoid possible trouble in the future I have prepared a new instrument, having a stronger case, which I will exchange for the one you now have.\"  \"That's very kind of you,\" said Rob, eagerly handing his battered machine to the Demon and receiving the new one in return.  \"Are you sure this will work?\"  \"It is impossible for you to injure it,\" answered the other.  \"And how about the next three gifts?\" inquired the boy, anxiously.  \"Before I grant them,\" replied the Demon, \"you must give me a promise to keep away from uncivilized places and to exhibit your acquirements only among people of intelligence.\"  \"All right,\" agreed the boy; \"I'm not anxious to visit that island again, or any other uncivilized country.\"  \"Then I will add to your possessions three gifts, each more precious and important than the three you have already received.\"  At this announcement Rob began to quiver with excitement, and sat staring eagerly at the Demon, while the latter increased in stature and sparkled and glowed more brilliantly than ever.     8.  Rob Acquires New Powers   \"I have seen the folly of sending you into the world with an offensive instrument, yet with no method of defense,\" resumed the Demon, presently.  \"You have knocked over a good many people with that tube during the past week.\"  \"I know,\" said Rob; \"but I couldn't help it.  It was the only way I had to protect myself.\"  \"Therefore my next gift shall be this Garment of Protection.  You must wear it underneath"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],["title","The Master Key (#7)"],["body"," clothing.  It has power to accumulate and exercise electrical repellent force.  Perhaps you do not know what that means, so I will explain more fully.  When any missile, such as a bullet, sword or lance, approaches your person, its rush through the air will arouse the repellent force of which I speak, and this force, being more powerful than the projective force, will arrest the flight of the missile and throw it back again.  Therefore nothing can touch your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness, and you will be safe from all ordinary weapons.  When wearing this Garment you will find it unnecessary to use the electric tube except on rare occasions.  Never allow revenge or animosity to influence your conduct. Men may threaten, but they can not injure you, so you must remember that they do not possess your mighty advantages, and that, because of your strength, you should bear with them patiently.\"  Rob examined the garment with much curiosity.  It glittered like silver, yet was soft and pliable as lamb's wool.  Evidently the Demon had prepared it especially for his use, for it was just Rob's size.  \"Now,\" continued the Demon, more gravely, \"we approach the subject of an electrical device so truly marvelous that even I am awed when I contemplate the accuracy and perfection of the natural laws which guide it and permit it to exercise its functions.  Mankind has as yet conceived nothing like it, for it requires full knowledge of electrical power to understand even its possibilities.\"  The Being paused, and drew from an inner pocket something resembling a flat metal box.  In size it was about four inches by six, and nearly an inch in thickness.  \"What is it?\" asked Rob, wonderingly.  \"It is an automatic Record of Events,\" answered the Demon.  \"I don't understand,\" said Rob, with hesitation.  \"I will explain to you its use,\" returned the Demon, \"although the electrical forces which operate it and the vibratory currents which are the true records must remain unknown to you until your brain has mastered the higher knowledge of electricity.  At present the practical side of this invention will be more interesting to you than a review of its scientific construction.  \"Suppose you wish to know the principal events that are occurring in Germany at the present moment.  You first turn this little wheel at the side until the word 'Germany' appears in the slot at the small end. Then open the top cover, which is hinged, and those passing events in which you are interested will appear before your eyes.\"  The Demon, as he spoke, opened the cover, and, looking within, the boy saw, as in a mirror, a moving picture before him.  A regiment of soldiers was marching through the streets of Berlin, and at its head rode a body of horsemen, in the midst of which was the Emperor himself. The people who thronged the sidewalks cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs with enthusiasm, while a band of musicians played a German air, which Rob could distinctly hear.  While he gazed, spell-bound, the scene changed, and he looked upon a great warship entering a harbor with flying pennants.  The rails were lined with officers and men straining their eyes for the first sight of their beloved \"VATERLAND\" after a long foreign cruise, and a ringing cheer, as from a thousand throats, came faintly to Rob's ear.  Again the scene changed, and within a dingy, underground room, hemmed in by walls of stone, and dimly lighted by a flickering lamp, a body of wild-eyed, desperate men were plighting an oath to murder the Emperor and overthrow his government.  \"Anarchists?\" asked Rob, trembling with excitement.  \"Anarchists!\" answered the Demon, with a faint sneer, and he shut the cover of the Record with a sudden snap.  \"It's wonderful!\" cried the boy, with a sigh that was followed by a slight shiver.  \"The Record is, indeed, proof within itself of the marvelous possibilities of electricity.  Men are now obliged to depend upon newspapers for information; but these can only relate events long after they have occurred.  And newspaper statements are often unreliable and sometimes wholly false, while many events of real importance are never printed in their columns.  You may guess what an improvement is this automatic Record of Events, which is as reliable as Truth itself. Nothing can be altered or falsified, for the vibratory currents convey the actual events to your vision, even as they happen.\"  \"But suppose,\" said Rob, \"that something important should happen while I'm asleep, or not looking at the box?\"  \"I have called this a Record,\" replied the Demon, \"and such it really is, although I have shown you only such events as are in process of being recorded.  By pressing this spring you may open the opposite cover of the box, where all events of importance that have occurred throughout the world during the previous twenty-four hours will appear before you in succession.  You may thus study them at your leisure. The various scenes constitute a register of the world's history, and may be recalled to view as often as you desire.\"  \"It's--it's like knowing everything,\" murmured Rob, deeply impressed for perhaps the first time in his life.  \"It IS knowing everything,\" returning the Demon; \"and this mighty gift I have decided to entrust to your care.  Be very careful as to whom you permit to gaze upon these pictures of passing events, for knowledge may often cause great misery to the human race.\"  \"I'll be careful,\" promised the boy, as he took the box reverently within his own hands.  \"The third and last gift of the present series,\" resumed the Demon, \"is one no less curious than the Record of Events, although it has an entirely different value.  It is a Character Marker.\"  \"What's that?\" inquired Rob.  \"I will explain.  Perhaps you know that your fellow-creatures are more or less hypocritical.  That is, they try to appear good when they are not, and wise when in reality they are foolish.  They tell you they are friendly when they positively hate you, and try to make you believe they are kind when their natures are cruel.  This hypocrisy seems to be a human failing.  One of your writers has said, with truth, that among civilized people things are seldom what they seem.\"  \"I've heard that,\" remarked Rob.  \"On the other hand,\" continued the Demon, \"some people with fierce countenances are kindly by nature, and many who appear to be evil are in reality honorable and trustworthy.  Therefore, that you may judge all your fellow-creatures truly, and know upon whom to depend, I give you the Character Marker.  It consists of this pair of spectacles. While you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead with a letter indicating his or her character.  The good will bear the letter 'G,' the evil the letter 'E.'  The wise will be marked with a 'W' and the foolish with an 'F.'  The kind will show a 'K' upon their foreheads and the cruel a letter 'C.'  Thus you may determine by a single look the true natures of all those you encounter.\"  \"And are these, also, electrical in their construction?\" asked the boy, as he took the spectacles.  \"Certainly.  Goodness, wisdom and kindness are natural forces, creating character.  For this reason men are not always to blame for bad character, as they acquire it unconsciously.  All character sends out certain electrical vibrations, which these spectacles concentrate in their lenses and exhibit to the gaze of their wearer, as I have explained.\"  \"It's a fine idea,\" said the boy; \"who discovered it?\"  \"It is a fact that has always existed, but is now utilized for the first time.\"  \"Oh!\" said Rob.  \"With these gifts, and the ones you acquired a week ago, you are now equipped to astound the world and awaken mankind to a realization of the wonders that may be accomplished by natural forces.  See that you employ these powers wisely, in the interests of science, and do not forget your promise to exhibit your electrical marvels only to those who are most capable of comprehending them.\"  \"I'll remember,\" said Rob.  \"Then adieu until a week from to-day, when I will meet you here at this hour and bestow upon you the last three gifts which you are entitled to receive.  Good-by!\"  \"Good-by!\" repeated Rob, and in a gorgeous flash of color the Demon disappeared, leaving the boy alone in the room with his new and wonderful possessions.     9.  The Second Journey   By this time you will have gained a fair idea of Rob's character.  He is, in truth, a typical American boy, possessing an average intelligence not yet regulated by the balance-wheel of experience.  The mysteries of electricity were so attractive to his eager nature that he had devoted considerable time and some study to electrical experiment; but his study was the superficial kind that seeks to master only such details as may be required at the moment.  Moreover, he was full of boyish recklessness and irresponsibility and therefore difficult to impress with the dignity of science and the gravity of human existence. Life, to him, was a great theater wherein he saw himself the most interesting if not the most important actor, and so enjoyed the play with unbounded enthusiasm.  Aside from the extraordinary accident which had forced the Electrical Demon into this life, Rob may be considered one of those youngsters who might possibly develop into a brilliant manhood or enter upon an ordinary, humdrum existence, as Fate should determine.  Just at present he had no thought beyond the passing hour, nor would he bother himself by attempting to look ahead or plan for the future.  Yet the importance of his electrical possessions and the stern injunction of the Demon to use them wisely had rendered the boy more thoughtful than at any previous time during his brief life, and he became so preoccupied at the dinner table that his father and mother cast many anxious looks in his direction.  Of course Rob was anxious to test his newly-acquired powers, and decided to lose no time "]]]
