Three days later, Vittoria received an order from the Government to quit the city within a prescribed number of hours, and her brain was racked to discover why Laura appeared so little indignant at the barbarous act of despotism.  Laura undertook to break the bad news to Merthyr.  The parting was as quiet and cheerful as, in the opposite degree, Vittoria had thought it would be melancholy and regretful.  \"What a Government!\" Merthyr said, and told her to let him hear of any changes.  \"All changes that please my friends please me.\"  Vittoria kissed his forehead with one grateful murmur of farewell to the bravest heart she had ever known.  The going to her happiness seemed more like going to something fatal until she reached the Lago Maggiore.  There she saw September beauty, and felt as if the splendour encircling her were her bridal decoration.  But no bridegroom stood to greet her on the terrace-steps between the potted orange and citron-trees.  Countess Ammiani extended kind hands to her at arms' length.  \"You have come,\" she said.  \"I hope that it is not too late.\"  Vittoria was a week without sight of her lover: nor did Countess Ammiani attempt to explain her words, or speak of other than common daily things. In body and soul Vittoria had taken a chill.  The silent blame resting on her in this house called up her pride, so that she would not ask any questions; and when Carlo came, she wanted warmth to melt her.  Their meeting was that of two passionless creatures.  Carlo kissed her loyally, and courteously inquired after her health and the health of friends in Milan, and then he rallied his mother.  Agostino had arrived with him, and the old man, being in one of his soft moods, unvexed by his conceits, Vittoria had some comfort from him of a dull kind.  She heard Carlo telling his mother that he must go in the morning.  Agostino replied to her quick look at him, \"I stay;\" and it seemed like a little saved from the wreck, for she knew that she could speak to Agostino as she could not to the countess.  When his mother prepared to retire, Carlo walked over to his bride, and repeated rapidly and brightly his inquiries after friends in Milan.  She, with a pure response to his natural-unnatural manner, spoke of Merthyr Powys chiefly: to which he said several times, \"Dear fellow!\"  and added, \"I shall always love Englishmen for his sake.\"  This gave her one throb.  \"I could not leave him, Carlo.\"  \"Certainly not, certainly not,\" said Carlo.  \"I should have been happy to wait on him myself.  I was busy; I am still.  I dare say you have guessed that I have a new journal in my head: the Pallanza Iris is to be the name of it;--to be printed in three colours, to advocate three principles, in three styles.  The Legitimists, the Moderates, and the Republicans are to proclaim themselves in its columns in prose, poetry, and hotch-potch. Once an editor, always an editor.  The authorities suspect that something of the sort is about to be planted, so I can only make occasional visits here:--therefore, as you will believe,\"--Carlo let his voice fall--\"I have good reason to hate them still.  They may cease to persecute me soon.\"  He insisted upon lighting his mother to her room.  Vittoria and Agostino sat talking of the Chief and the minor events of the war--of Luciano, Marco, Giulio, and Ugo Corte--till the conviction fastened on them that Carlo would not return, when Agostino stood up and said, yawning wearily, \"I'll talk further to you, my child, tomorrow.\"  She begged that it might be now.  \"No; to-morrow,\" said he.  \"Now, now!\" she reiterated, and brought down a reproof from his fore- finger.  \"The poetic definition of 'now' is that it is a small boat, my daughter, in which the female heart is constantly pushing out to sea and sinking. 'To-morrow' is an island in the deeps, where grain grows.  When I land you there, I will talk to you.\"  She knew that he went to join Carlo after he had quitted her.  Agostino was true to his promise next day.  He brought her nearer to what she had to face, though he did not help her vision much.  Carlo had gone before sunrise.  They sat on the terrace above the lake, screened from the sunlight by thick myrtle bushes.  Agostino smoked his loosely-rolled cigarettes, and Vittoria sipped chocolate and looked upward to the summit of Motterone, with many thoughts and images in her mind.  He commenced by giving her a love-message from Carlo.  \"Hold fast to it that he means it: conduct is never a straight index where the heart's involved,\" said the chuckling old man; \"or it is not in times like ours. You have been in the wrong, and your having a good excuse will not help you before the deciding fates.  Woman that you are! did you not think that because we were beaten we were going to rest for a very long while, and that your Carlo of yesterday was going to be your Carlo of to-day?\"  Vittoria tacitly confessed to it.  \"Ay,\" he pursued, \"when you wrote to him in the Val d'Intelvi, you supposed you had only to say, 'I am ready,' which was then the case.  You made your summer and left the fruits to hang, and now you are astounded that seasons pass and fruits drop.  You should have come to this place, if but for a pair of days, and so have fixed one matter in the chapter. This is how the chapter has run on.  I see I talk to a stunned head; you are thinking that Carlo's love for you can't have changed: and it has not, but occasion has gone and times have changed.  Now listen.  The countess desired the marriage.  Carlo could not go to you in Milan with the sword in his hand.  Therefore you had to come to him.  He waited for you, perhaps for his own preposterous lover's sake as much as to make his mother's heart easy.  If she loses him she loses everything, unless he leaves a wife to her care and the hope that her House will not be extinct, which is possibly not much more the weakness of old aristocracy than of human nature.  \"Meantime, his brothers in arms had broken up and entered Piedmont, and he remained waiting for you still.  You are thinking that he had not waited a month.  But if four months finished Lombardy, less than one month is quite sufficient to do the same for us little beings.  He met the Countess d'Isorella here.  You have to thank her for seeing him at all, so don't wrinkle your forehead yet.  Luciano Romara is drilling his men in Piedmont; Angelo Guidascarpi has gone there.  Carlo was considering it his duty to join Luciano, when he met this lady, and she has apparently succeeded in altering his plans.  Luciano and his band will go to Rome.  Carlo fancies that another blow will be struck for Lombardy.  This lady should know; the point is, whether she can be trusted.  She persists in declaring that Carlo's duty is to remain, and-- I cannot tell how, for I am as a child among women--she has persuaded him of her sincerity.  Favour me now with your clearest understanding, and deliver it from feminine sensations of any description for just two minutes.\"  Agostino threw away the end of a cigarette and looked for firmness in Vittoria's eyes.  \"This Countess d'Isorella is opposed to Carlo's marriage at present.  She says that she is betraying the king's secrets, and has no reliance on a woman.  As a woman you will pardon her, for it is the language of your sex.  You are also denounced by Barto Rizzo, a madman--he went mad as fire, and had to be chained at Varese.  In some way or other Countess d'Isorella got possession of him; she has managed to subdue him.  A sword-cut he received once in Verona has undoubtedly affected his brain, or caused it to be affected under strong excitement.  He is at her villa, and she says--perhaps with some truth--that Carlo would in several ways lose his influence by his immediate marriage with you.  The reason must have weight; otherwise he would fulfil his mother's principal request, and be at the bidding of his own desire.  There; I hope I have spoken plainly.\"  Agostino puffed a sigh of relief at the conclusion of his task.  Vittoria had been too strenuously engaged in defending the steadiness of her own eyes to notice the shadow of an assumption of frankness in his.  She said that she understood.  She got away to her room like an insect carrying a load thrice its own size.  All that she could really gather from Agostino's words was, that she felt herself rocking in a tower, and that Violetta d'Isorella was beautiful.  She had striven hard to listen to him with her wits alone, and her sensations subsequently revenged themselves in this fashion.  The tower rocked and struck a bell that she discovered to be her betraying voice uttering cries of pain.  She was for hours incapable of meeting Agostino again.  His delicate intuition took the harshness off the meeting.  He led her even to examine her state of mind, and to discern the fancies from the feelings by which she was agitated.  He said shrewdly and bluntly, \"You can master pain, but not doubt.  If you show a sign of unhappiness, remember that I shall know you doubt both what I have told you, and Carlo as well.\"  Vittoria fenced: \"But is there such a thing as happiness?\"  \"I should imagine so,\" said Agostino, touching her cheek, \"and slipperiness likewise.  There's patience at any rate; only you must dig for it.  You arrive at nothing, but the eternal digging constitutes the object gained.  I recollect when I was a raw lad, full of ambition, in love, and without a franc in my pockets, one night in Paris, I found myself looking up at a street lamp; there was a moth in it.  He couldn't get out, so he had very little to trouble his conscience.  I think he was near happiness: he ought to have been happy.  My luck was not so good, or you wouldn't see me still alive, my dear.\"  Vittoria sighed for a plainer speaker.     CHAPTER XXXVII  ON LAGO MAGGIORE  Carlo's hours were passed chiefly across the lake, in the Piedmontese valleys.  When at Pallanza he was restless,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4441"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 7 (#8)"],["body","he shunned the two or three minutes of privacy with his betrothed which the rigorous Italian laws besetting courtship might have allowed him to take.  He had perpetually the look of a man starting from wine.  It was evident that he and Countess d'Isorella continued to hold close communication, for she came regularly to the villa to meet him.  On these occasions Countess Ammiani accorded her one ceremonious interview, and straightway locked herself in her room.  Violetta's grace of ease and vivacity soared too high to be subject to any hostile judgement of her character.  She seemed to rely entirely on the force of her beauty, and to care little for those who did not acknowledge it.  She accepted public compliments quite royally, nor was Agostino backward in offering them.  \"And you have a voice, you know,\" he sometimes said aside to Vittoria; but she had forgotten how easily she could swallow great praise of her voice; she had almost forgotten her voice.  Her delight was to hang her head above inverted mountains in the lake, and dream that she was just something better than the poorest of human creatures.  She could not avoid putting her mind in competition with this brilliant woman's, and feeling eclipsed; and her weakness became pitiable.  But Countess d'Isorella mentioned once that Pericles was at the Villa Ricciardi, projecting magnificent operatic entertainments.  The reviving of a passion to sing possessed Vittoria like a thirst for freedom, and instantly confused all the reflected images within her, as the fury of a sudden wind from the high Alps scourges the glassy surface of the lake.  She begged Countess Ammiani's permission that she might propose to Pericles to sing in his private operatic company, in any part, at the shortest notice.  \"You wish to leave me?\" said the countess, and resolutely conceived it.  Speaking to her son on this subject, she thought it necessary to make some excuse for a singer's instinct, who really did not live save on the stage.  It amused Carlo; he knew when his mother was really angry with persons she tried to shield from the anger of others; and her not seeing the wrong on his side in his behaviour to his betrothed was laughable. Nevertheless she had divined the case more correctly than he: the lover was hurt.  After what he had endured, he supposed, with all his forgiveness, that he had an illimitable claim upon his bride's patience. He told his another to speak to her openly.  \"Why not you, my Carlo?\" said the countess.  \"Because, mother, if I speak to her, I shall end by throwing out my arms and calling for the priest.\"  \"I would clap hands to that.\"  \"We will see; it may be soon or late, but it can't be now.\"  \"How much am I to tell her, Carlo?\"  \"Enough to keep her from fretting.\"  The countess then asked herself how much she knew.  Her habit of receiving her son's word and will as supreme kept her ignorant of anything beyond the outline of his plans; and being told to speak openly of them to another, she discovered that her acquiescing imagination supplied the chief part of her knowledge.  She was ashamed also to have it thought, even by Carlo, that she had not gathered every detail of his occupation, so that she could not argue against him, and had to submit to see her dearest wishes lightly swept aside.  \"I beg you to tell me what you think of Countess d'Isorella; not the afterthought,\" she said to Vittoria.  \"She is beautiful, dear Countess Ammiani.\"  \"Call me mother now and then.  Yes; she is beautiful.  She has a bad name.\"  \"Envy must have given it, I think.\"  \"Of course she provokes envy.  But I say that her name is bad, as envy could not make it.  She is a woman who goes on missions, and carries a husband into society like a passport.  You have only thought of her beauty?\"  \"I can see nothing else,\" said Vittoria, whose torture at the sight of the beauty was appeased by her disingenuous pleading on its behalf.  \"In my time Beauty was a sinner,\" the countess resumed.  \"My confessor has filled my ears with warnings that it is a net to the soul, a weapon for devils.  May the saints of Paradise make bare the beauty of this woman.  She has persuaded Carlo that she is serving the country.  You have let him lie here alone in a fruitless bed, silly girl.  He stayed for you while his comrades called him to Vercelli, where they are assembled.  The man whom he salutes as his Chief gave him word to go there.  They are bound for Rome.  Ah me!  Rome is a great name, but Lombardy is Carlo's natal home, and Lombardy bleeds.  You were absent-- how long you were absent!  If you could know the heaviness of those days of his waiting for you.  And it was I who kept him here!  I must have omitted a prayer, for he would have been at Vercelli now with Luciano and Emilio, and you might have gone to him; but he met this woman, who has convinced him that Piedmont will make a Winter march, and that his marriage must be delayed.\"  The countess raised her face and drooped her hands from the wrists, exclaiming, \"If I have lately omitted one prayer, enlighten me, blessed heaven!  I am blind; I cannot see for my son; I am quite blind.  I do not love the woman; therefore I doubt myself.  You, my daughter, tell me your thought of her, tell me what you think.  Young eyes observe; young heads are sometimes shrewd in guessing.\"  Vittoria said, after a pause, \"I will believe her to be true, if she supports the king.\"  It was hardly truthful speaking on her part.  \"How can Carlo have been persuaded!\"  the countess sighed.  \"By me?\"  Victoria asked herself, and for a moment she was exulting.  She spoke from that emotion when it had ceased to animate her.  \"Carlo was angry with the king.  He echoed Agostino, but Agostino does not sting as he did, and Carlo cannot avoid seeing what the king has sacrificed.  Perhaps the Countess d'Isorella has shown him promises of fresh aid in the king's handwriting.  Suffering has made Carlo Alberto one with the Republicans, if he had other ambitions once.  And Carlo dedicates his blood to Lombardy: he does rightly.  Dear countess--my mother!  I have made him wait for me; I will be patient in waiting for him.  I know that Countess d'Isorella is intimate with the king.  There is a man named Barto Rizzo, who thinks me a guilty traitress, and she is making use of this man.  That must be her reason for prohibiting the marriage.  She cannot be false if she is capable of uniting extreme revolutionary agents and the king in one plot, I think; I do not know.\" Vittoria concluded her perfect expression of confidence with this atoning doubtfulness.  Countess Ammiani obtained her consent that she would not quit her side.  After Violetta had gone, Carlo, though he shunned secret interviews, addressed his betrothed as one who was not strange to his occupation and the trial his heart was undergoing.  She could not doubt that she was beloved, in spite of the colourlessness and tonelessness of a love that appealed to her intellect.  He showed her a letter he had received from Laura, laughing at its abuse of Countess d'Isorella, and the sarcasms levelled at himself.  In this letter Laura said that she was engaged in something besides nursing.  Carlo pointed his finger to the sentence, and remarked, \"I must have your promise--a word from you is enough--that you will not meddle with any intrigue.\"  Vittoria gave the promise, half trusting it to bring the lost bloom of their love to him; but he received it as a plain matter of necessity. Certain of his love, she wondered painfully that it should continue so barren of music.  \"Why am I to pledge myself that I will be useless?\" she asked.  \"You mean, my Carlo, that I am to sit still, and watch, and wait.\"  He answered, \"I will tell you this much: I can be struck vitally through you.  In the game I am playing, I am able to defend myself.  If you enter it, distraction begins.  Stay with my mother.\"  \"Am I to know nothing?\"  \"Everything--in good time.\"  \"I might--might I not help you, my Carlo?\"  \"Yes; and nobly too.  And I show you the way.\"  Agostino and Carlo made an expedition to Turin.  Before he went, Carlo took her in his arms.  \"Is it coming?\"  she said, shutting her eyelids like a child expecting the report of firearms.  He pressed his lips to the closed eyes.  \"Not yet; but are you growing timid?\"  His voice seemed to reprove her.  She could have told him that keeping her in the dark among unknown terrors ruined her courage; but the minutes were too precious, his touch too sweet.  In eyes and hands he had become her lover again.  The blissful minutes rolled away like waves that keep the sunshine out at sea.  Her solitude in the villa was beguiled by the arrival of the score of an operatic scena, entitled \"HAGAR,\" by Rocco Ricci, which she fancied that either Carlo or her dear old master had sent, and she devoured it.  She thought it written expressly for her.  With HAGAR she communed during the long hours, and sang herself on to the verge of an imagined desert beyond the mountain-shadowed lake and the last view of her beloved Motterone. Hagar's face of tears in the Brerawas known to her; and Hagar in her 'Addio' gave the living voice to that dumb one.  Vittoria revelled in the delicious vocal misery.  She expanded with the sorrow of poor Hagar, whose tears refreshed her, and parted her from her recent narrowing self- consciousness.  The great green mountain fronted her like a living presence.  Motterone supplied the place of the robust and venerable patriarch, whom she reproached, and worshipped, but with a fathomless burdensome sense of cruel injustice, deeper than the tears or the voice which spoke of it: a feeling of subjected love that was like a mother's giving suck to a detested child.  Countess Ammiani saw the abrupt alteration of her step and look with a dim surprise.  \"What do you conceal from me?\"  she asked, and supplied the answer by charitably attributing it to news that the signora Piaveni was coming.  When Laura "]]]
