The Piazza d'Armi was the field of Mars of Milan, and an Austrian review of arms there used to be a tropical pageant.  The place was too narrow for broad manoeuvres, or for much more than to furnish an inspection of all arms to the General, and a display (with its meaning) to the populace.  An unusually large concourse of spectators lined the square, like a black border to a vast bed of flowers, nodding now this way, now that.  Carlo and Luciano passed among the groups, presenting the perfectly smooth faces of young men of fashion, according to the universal aristocratic pattern handed down to querulous mortals from Olympus--the secret of which is to show a triumphant inaction of the heart and the brain, that are rendered positively subservient to elegance of limb.  They knew the chances were in favour of their being arrested at any instant.  None of the higher members of the Milanese aristocracy were visible; the people looked sullen.  Carlo was attracted by the tall figure of the Signor Antonio-Pericles, whom he beheld in converse with the commandant of the citadel, out in the square, among chatting and laughing General officers.  At Carlo's elbow there came a burst of English tongues; he heard Vittoria's English name spoken with animation. 'Admire those faces,' he said to Luciano, but the latter was interchanging quiet recognitions among various heads of the crowd; a language of the eyelids and the eyebrows.  When he did look round he admired the fair island faces with an Italian's ardour: 'Their women are splendid!' and he no longer pushed upon Carlo's arm to make way ahead. In the English group were two sunny-haired girls and a blue-eyed lady with the famous English curls, full, and rounding richly.  This lady talked of her brother, and pointed him out as he rode down the line in the Marshal's staff.  The young officer indicated presently broke away and galloped up to her, bending over his horse's neck to join the conversation.  Emilia Belloni's name was mentioned.  He stared, and appeared to insist upon a contrary statement.  Carlo scrutinized his features.  While doing so he was accosted, and beheld his former adversary of the Motter--one, with whom he had yesterday shaken hands in the Piazza of La Scala.  The ceremony was cordially renewed.  Luciano unlinked his arm from Carlo and left him.  'It appears that you are mistaken with reference to Mademoiselle Belloni,' said Captain Gambier.  'We hear on positive authority that she will not appear at La Scala to-night.  It's a disappointment; though, from what you did me the honour to hint to me, I cannot allow myself to regret it.'  Carlo had a passionate inward prompting to trust this Englishman with the secret.  It was a weakness that he checked.  When one really takes to foreigners, there is a peculiar impulse (I speak of the people who are accessible to impulse) to make brothers of them.  He bowed, and said, 'She does not appear?'  'She has in fact quitted Milan.  Not willingly.  I would have stopped the business if I had known anything of it; but she is better out of the way, and will be carefully looked after, where she is.  By this time she is in the Tyrol.'  'And where?' asked Carlo, with friendly interest.  'At a schloss near Meran.  Or she will be there in a very few hours. I feared--I may inform you that we were very good friends in England-- I feared that when she once came to Italy she would get into political scrapes.  I dare say you agree with me that women have nothing to do with politics.  Observe: you see the lady who is speaking to the Austrian officer?--he is her brother.  Like Mademoiselle Belloni he has adopted a fresh name; it's the name of his uncle, a General Pierson in the Austrian service.  I knew him in England: he has been in our service. Mademoiselle Belloni lived with his sisters for some years two or three. As you may suppose, they are all anxious to see her.  Shall I introduce. you?  They will be glad to know one of her Italian friends.'  Carlo hesitated; he longed to hear those ladies talk of Vittoria.  'Do they speak French?'  'Oh, dear, yes.  That is, as we luckless English people speak it. Perhaps you will more easily pardon their seminary Italian.  See there,' Captain Gambier pointed at some trotting squadrons; 'these Austrians have certainly a matchless cavalry.  The artillery seems good.  The infantry are fine men--very fine men.  They have a \"woodeny\" movement; but that's in the nature of the case: tremendous discipline alone gives homogeneity to all those nationalities.  Somehow they get beaten.  I doubt whether anything will beat their cavalry.'  'They are useless in street-fighting,' said Carlo.  'Oh, street-fighting!' Captain Gambier vented a soldier's disgust at the notion.  'They're not in Paris.  Will you step forward?'  Just then the tall Greek approached the party of English.  The introduction was delayed.  He was addressed by the fair lady, in the island tongue, as 'Mr. Pericles.' She thanked him for his extreme condescension in deigning to notice them.  But whatever his condescension had been, it did not extend to an admitted acquaintance with the poor speech of the land of fogs.  An exhibition of aching deafness was presented to her so resolutely, that at last she faltered, 'What!  have you forgotten English, Mr. Pericles?  You spoke it the other day.'  'It is ze language of necessity--of commerce,' he replied.  'But, surely, Mr. Pericles, you dare not presume to tell me you choose to be ignorant of it whenever you please?'  'I do not take grits into ze teeth, madame; no more.' 'But you speak it perfectly.'  'Perfect it may be, for ze transactions of commerce.  I wish to keep my teez.'  'Alas!' said the lady, compelled, 'I must endeavour to swim in French.'  'At your service, madame,' quoth the Greek, with an immediate doubling of the length of his body.  Carlo heard little more than he knew; but the confirmation of what we know will sometimes instigate us like fresh intelligence, and the lover's heart was quick to apprehend far more than he knew in one direction.  He divined instantaneously that the English-Austrian spoken of by Barto Rizzo was the officer sitting on horseback within half-a-dozen yards of him.  The certainty of the thought cramped his muscles.  For the rest, it became clear to him that the attempt of the millionaire connoisseur to carry off Vittoria had received the tacit sanction of the Austrian authorities; for reasons quite explicable, Mr. Pericles, as the English lady called him, distinctly hinted it, while affirming with vehement self-laudation that his scheme had succeeded for the vindication of Art.  'The opera you will hear zis night,' he said, 'will be hissed.  You will hear a chorus of screech-owls to each song of that poor Irma, whom the Italian people call \"crabapple.\"  Well; she pleases German ears, and if they can support her, it is well.  But la Vittoria--your Belloni--you will not hear; and why?  She has been false to her Art, false!  She has become a little devil in politics.  It is a Guy Fawkes femelle!  She has been guilty of the immense crime of ingratitude.  She is dismissed to study, to penitence, and to the society of her old friends, if they will visit her.'  'Of course we will,' said the English lady; 'either before or after our visit to Venice--delicious Venice!'  'Which you have not seen--hein?' Mr. Pericles snarled; 'and have not smelt.  There is no music in Venice!  But you have nothing but street tinkle-tinkle!  A place to live in! mon Dieu!'  The lady smiled.  'My husband insists upon trying the baths of Bormio, and then we are to go over a pass for him to try the grape-cure at Meran. If I can get him to promise me one whole year in Italy, our visit to Venice may be deferred.  Our doctor, monsieur, indicates our route.  If my brother can get leave of absence, we shall go to Bormio and to Meran with him.  He is naturally astonished that Emilia refused to see him; and she refused to see us too!  She wrote a letter, dated from the Conservatorio to him, he had it in his saddlebag, and was robbed of it and other precious documents, when the wretched, odious people set upon him in Verona-poor boy!  She said in the letter that she would see him in a few days after the fifteenth, which is to-day!  'Ah!  a few days after the fifteenth, which is to-day,' Mr. Pericles repeated.  'I saw you but the day before yesterday, madame, or I could have brought you together.  She is now away-off--out of sight--the perfule!  Ah false that she is; speak not of her.  You remember her in England.  There it was trouble, trouble; but here, we are a pot on a fire with her; speak not of her. She has used me ill, madame.  I am sick.'  His violent gesticulation drooped.  In a temporary abandonment to chagrin, he wiped the moisture from his forehead, unwilling or heedless of the mild ironical mouthing of the ladies, and looked about; for Carlo had made a movement to retire,--he had heard enough for discomfort.  'Ah! my dear Ammiani, the youngest editor in Europe! how goes it with you?' the Greek called out with revived affability.  Captain Gambier perceived that it was time to present his Italian acquaintance to the ladies by name, as a friend of Mademoiselle Belloni.  'My most dear Ammiani,' Antonio-Pericles resumed; he barely attempted to conceal his acrid delight in casting a mysterious shadow of coming vexation over the youth; 'I am afraid you will not like the opera Camilla, or perhaps it is the Camilla you will not like.  But, shoulder arms, march!' (a foot regiment in motion suggested the form of the recommendation) 'what is not for to-day may be for to-morrow.  Let us wait.  I think, my Ammiani, you are to have a lemon and not an orange. Never mind.  Let us wait.'  Carlo got his forehead into a show of smoothness, and said, 'Suppose, my dear Signor Antonio,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4437"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 3 (#8)"],["body","prophet of dark things were to say to himself, \"Let us wait?\"'  'Hein-it is deep.' Antonio-Pericles affected to sound the sentence, eye upon earth, as a sparrow spies worm or crumb.  'Permit me,' he added rapidly; an idea had struck him from his malicious reserve stores,-- 'Here is Lieutenant Pierson, of the staff of the Field-Marshal of Austria, unattached, an old friend of Mademoiselle Emilia Belloni,-- permit me,--here is Count Ammiani, of the Lombardia Milanese journal, a new friend of the Signorina Vittoria Campa-Mademoiselle Belloni the Signorina Campa--it is the same person, messieurs; permit me to introduce you.'  Antonio-Pericles waved his arm between the two young men.  Their plain perplexity caused him to dash his fingers down each side of his moustachios in tugs of enjoyment.  For Lieutenant Pierson, who displayed a certain readiness to bow, had caught a sight of the repellent stare on Ammiani's face; a still and flat look, not aggressive, yet anything but inviting; like a shield.  Nevertheless, the lieutenant's head produced a stiff nod.  Carlo's did not respond; but he lifted his hat and bowed humbly in retirement to the ladies.  Captain Gambier stepped aside with him.  'Inform Lieutenant Pierson, I beg you,' said Ammiani, 'that I am at his orders, if he should consider that I have insulted him.'  'By all means,' said Gambier; 'only, you know, it's impossible for me to guess what is the matter; and I don't think he knows.'  Luciano happened to be coming near.  Carlo went up to him, and stood talking for half a minute.  He then returned to Captain Gambier, and said, 'I put myself in the hands of a man of honour.  You are aware that Italian gentlemen are not on terms with Austrian officers.  If I am seen exchanging salutes with any one of them, I offend my countrymen; and they have enough to bear already.'  Perceiving that there was more in the background, Gambier simply bowed. He had heard of Italian gentlemen incurring the suspicion of their fellows by merely being seen in proximity to an Austrian officer.  As they were parting, Carlo said to him, with a very direct meaning in his eyes, 'Go to the opera tonight.'  'Yes, I suppose so,' the Englishman answered, and digested the look and the recommendation subsequently.  Lieutenant Pierson had ridden off.  The war-machine was in motion from end to end: the field of flowers was a streaming flood; regiment by regiment, the crash of bands went by.  Outwardly the Italians conducted themselves with the air of ordinary heedless citizens, in whose bosoms the music set no hell-broth boiling.  Patrician and plebeian, they were chiefly boys; though here and there a middle-aged workman cast a look of intelligence upon Carlo and Luciano, when these two passed along the crowd.  A gloom of hoarded hatred was visible in the mass of faces, ready to spring fierily.  Arms were in the city.  With hatred to prompt the blow, with arms to strike, so much dishonour to avenge, we need not wonder that these youths beheld the bit of liberty in prospect magnified by their mighty obfuscating ardour, like a lantern in a fog.  Reason did not act.  They were in such a state when just to say 'Italia!  Italia!' gave them nerve to match an athlete.  So, the parading of Austria, the towering athlete, failed of its complete lesson of intimidation, and only ruffled the surface of insurgent hearts.  It seemed, and it was, an insult to the trodden people, who read it as a lesson for cravens: their instinct commonly hits the bell.  They felt that a secure supremacy would not have paraded itself: so they divined indistinctly that there was weakness somewhere in the councils of the enemy.  When the show had vanished, their spirits hung pausing, like the hollow air emptied of big sound, and reacted.  Austria had gained little more by her display than the conscientious satisfaction of the pedagogue who lifts the rod to advise intending juvenile culprits how richly it can be merited and how poor will be their future grounds of complaint.  But before Austria herself had been taught a lesson she conceived that she had but one man and his feeble instruments, and occasional frenzies, opposed to her, him whom we saw on the Motterone, which was ceasing to be true; though it was true that the whole popular movement flowed from that one man.  She observed travelling sparks in the embers of Italy, and crushed them under her heel, without reflecting that a vital heat must be gathering where the spots of fire run with such a swiftness.  It was her belief that if she could seize that one man, whom many of the younger nobles and all the people acknowledged as their Chief--for he stood then without a rival in his task--she would have the neck of conspiracy in her angry grasp.  Had she caught him, the conspiracy for Italian freedom would not have crowed for many long seasons; the torch would have been ready, but not the magazine.  He prepared it; it was he who preached to the Italians that opportunity is a mocking devil when we look for it to be revealed; or, in other words, wait for chance; as it is God's angel when it is created within us, the ripe fruit of virtue and devotion.  He cried out to Italians to wait for no inspiration but their own; that they should never subdue their minds to follow any alien example; nor let a foreign city of fire be their beacon.  Watching over his Italy; her wrist in his meditative clasp year by year; he stood like a mystic leech by the couch of a fair and hopeless frame, pledged to revive it by the inspired assurance, shared by none, that life had not forsaken it.  A body given over to death and vultures-he stood by it in the desert.  Is it a marvel to you that when the carrion-wings swooped low, and the claws fixed, and the beak plucked and savoured its morsel, he raised his arm, and urged the half-resuscitated frame to some vindicating show of existence? Arise! he said, even in what appeared most fatal hours of darkness. The slack limbs moved; the body rose and fell.  The cost of the effort was the breaking out of innumerable wounds, old and new; the gain was the display of the miracle that Italy lived.  She tasted her own blood, and herself knew that she lived.  Then she felt her chains.  The time was coming for her to prove, by the virtues within her, that she was worthy to live, when others of her sons, subtle and adept, intricate as serpents, bold, unquestioning as well- bestridden steeds, should grapple and play deep for her in the game of worldly strife.  Now--at this hour of which I speak--when Austrians marched like a merry flame down Milan streets, and Italians stood like the burnt-out cinders of the fire-grate, Italy's faint wrist was still in the clutch of her grave leech, who counted the beating of her pulse between long pauses, that would have made another think life to be heaving its last, not beginning.  The Piazza d'Armi was empty of its glittering show.     CHAPTER XVIII  THE NIGHT OF THE FIFTEENTH  We quit the Piazza d'Armi.  Rumour had its home in Milan.  On their way to the caffe La Scala, Luciano and Carlo (who held together, determined to be taken together if the arrest should come) heard it said that the Chief was in Milan.  A man passed by and uttered it, going.  They stopped a second man, who was known to them, and he confirmed the rumour.  Glad as sunlight once more, they hurried to Count Medole forgivingly.  The count's servant assured them that his master had left the city for Monza. 'Is Medole a coward?' cried Luciano, almost in the servant's hearing. The fleeing of so important a man looked vile, now that they were sharpened by new eagerness.  Forthwith they were off to Agostino, believing that he would know the truth.  They found him in bed.  'Well, and what?' said Agostino, replying to their laughter.  'I am old; too old to stride across a day and night, like you giants of youth.  I take my rest when I can, for I must have it.'  'But, you know, O conscript father,' said Carlo, willing to fall a little into his mood, 'you know that nothing will be done to-night.'  'Do I know so much?' Agostino murmured at full length.  'Do you know that the Chief is in the city?' said Luciano.  'A man who is lying in bed knows this,' returned Agostino, 'that he knows less than those who are up, though what he does know he perhaps digests better.  'Tis you who are the fountains, my boys, while I am the pool into which you play.  Say on.'  They spoke of the rumour.  He smiled at it.  They saw at once that the rumour was false, for the Chief trusted Agostino.  'Proceed to Barto, the mole,' he said, 'Barto the miner; he is the father of daylight in the city: of the daylight of knowledge, you understand, for which men must dig deep.  Proceed to him;--if you can find him.'  But Carlo brought flame into Agostino's eyes.  'The accursed beast! he has pinned the black butterfly to the signorina's dress.'  Agostino rose on his elbow.  He gazed at them.  'We are followers of a blind mole,' he uttered with an inner voices while still gazing wrathfully, and then burst out in grief, '\"Patria o mea creatrix, patria o mea genetrix!\"'  'The signorina takes none of his warnings, nor do we.  She escaped a plot last night, and to-night she sings.'  'She must not,' said Agostino imperiously.  'She does.'  'I must stop that.'  Agostino jumped out of bed.  The young men beset him with entreaties to leave the option to her.  'Fools!' he cried, plunging a rageing leg into his garments.  'Here, Iris!  Mercury! fly to Jupiter and say we are all old men and boys in Italy, and are ready to accept a few middleaged mortals as Gods, if they will come and help us.  Young fools!  Do you know that when you conspire you are in harness, and yoke-fellows, every one?'  'Yoked to that Barto Rizzo!'  'Yes; and the worse horse of the two.  Listen, you pair of Nuremberg puppet-heads!  If the Chief were here, I would lie still in my bed. Medole has stopped the outbreak.  Right or wrong, he moves a "]]]
