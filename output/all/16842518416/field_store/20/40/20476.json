And let those whose lot it is to act thus, remember that the fulfillment of a great duty rests with them. The destiny of humanity in the world depends, so far as it depends on men at all, on their fidelity to their religion.  Let them confess their conviction, and stand up for it, and not in words alone, but in sufferings too, if need be.  If you believe that Christ forbade murder, pay no heed to the arguments nor to the commands of those who call on you to bear a hand in it.  By such a steadfast refusal to make use of force, you call down on yourselves the blessing promised to those \"who hear these sayings and do them,\" and the time will come when the world will recognize you as having aided in the reformation of mankind.  Musser's book is called \"Non-resistance Asserted,\" or \"Kingdom of Christ and Kingdoms of this World Separated.\"  This book is devoted to the same question, and was written when the American Government was exacting military service from its citizens at the time of the Civil War.  And it has, too, a value for all time, dealing with the question how, in such circumstances, people should and can refuse to enter military service. Here is the tenor of the author's introductory remarks:     \"It is well known that there are many persons in the United    States who refuse to fight on grounds of conscience.  They are    called the 'defenseless,' or 'non-resistant' Christians.  These    Christians refuse to defend their country, to bear arms, or at    the call of government to make war on its enemies.  Till lately    this religious scruple seemed a valid excuse to the government,    and those who urged it were let off service.  But at the    beginning of our Civil War public opinion was agitated on this    subject.  It was natural that persons who considered it their    duty to bear all the hardships and dangers of war in defense of    their country should feel resentment against those persons who    had for long shared with them the advantages of the protection    of government, and who now in time of need and danger would not    share in bearing the labors and dangers of its defense.  It was    even natural that they should declare the attitude of such men    monstrous, irrational, and suspicious.\"  A host of orators and writers, our author tells us, arose to oppose this attitude, and tried to prove the sinfulness of non-resistance, both from Scripture and on common-sense grounds. And this was perfectly natural, and in many cases the authors were right--right, that is, in regard to persons who did not renounce the benefits they received from the government and tried to avoid the hardships of military service, but not right in regard to the principle of non-resistance itself. Above all, our author proves the binding nature of the rule of non-resistance for a Christian, pointing out that this command is perfectly clear, and is enjoined upon every Christian by Christ without possibility of misinterpretation. \"Bethink yourselves whether it is righteous to obey man more than God,\" said Peter and John. And this is precisely what ought to be the attitude to every man who wishes to be Christian to the claim on him for military service, when Christ has said, \"Resist not evil by force.\" As for the question of the principle itself, the author regards that as decided. As to the second question, whether people have the right to refuse to serve in the army who have not refused the benefits conferred by a government resting on force, the author considers it in detail, and arrives at the conclusion that a Christian following the law of Christ, since he does not go to war, ought not either to take advantage of any institutions of government, courts of law, or elections, and that in his private concerns he must not have recourse to the authorities, the police, or the law. Further on in the book he treats of the relation of the Old Testament to the New, the value of government for those who are Christians, and makes some observations on the doctrine of non-resistance and the attacks made on it. The author concludes his book by saying: \"Christians do not need government, and therefore they cannot either obey it in what is contrary to Christ's teaching nor, still less, take part in it.\" Christ took his disciples out of the world, he says. They do not expect worldly blessings and worldly happiness, but they expect eternal life. The Spirit in whom they live makes them contented and happy in every position. If the world tolerates them, they are always happy. If the world will not leave them in peace, they will go elsewhere, since they are pilgrims on the earth and they have no fixed place of habitation. They believe that \"the dead may bury their dead.\" One thing only is needful for them, \"to follow their Master.\"  Even putting aside the question as to the principle laid down in these two books as to the Christian's duty in his attitude to war, one cannot help perceiving the practical importance and the urgent need of deciding the question.  There are people, hundreds of thousands of Quakers, Mennonites, all our Douhobortsi, Molokani, and others who do not belong to any definite sect, who consider that the use of force--and, consequently, military service--is inconsistent with Christianity. Consequently there are every year among us in Russia some men called upon for military service who refuse to serve on the ground of their religious convictions.  Does the government let them off then?  No.  Does it compel them to go, and in case of disobedience punish them?  No. This was how the government treated them in 1818.  Here is an extract from the diary of Nicholas Myravyov of Kars, which was not passed by the censor, and is not known in Russia:     \"Tiflis, October 2, 1818.     \"In the morning the commandant told me that five peasants    belonging to a landowner in the Tamboff government had lately    been sent to Georgia.  These men had been sent for soldiers,    but they would not serve; they had been several times flogged    and made to run the gauntlet, but they would submit readily to    the cruelest tortures, and even to death, rather than serve.    'Let us go,' they said, 'and leave us alone; we will not hurt    anyone; all men are equal, and the Tzar is a man like us; why    should we pay him tribute; why should I expose my life to    danger to kill in battle some man who has done me no harm?  You    can cut us to pieces and we will not be soldiers.  He who has    compassion on us will give us charity, but as for the    government rations, we have not had them and we do not want to    have them.'  These were the words of those peasants, who declare    that there are numbers like them Russia.  They brought them    four times before the Committee of Ministers, and at last    decided to lay the matter before the Tzar who gave orders that    they should be taken to Georgia for correction, and commanded    the commander-in-chief to send him a report every month of    their gradual success in bringing these peasants to a better    mind.\"  How the correction ended is not known, as the whole episode indeed was unknown, having been kept in profound secrecy.  This was how the government behaved seventy-five years ago--this is how it has behaved in a great cumber of cases, studiously concealed from the people.  And this is how the government behaves now, except in the case of the German Mennonites, living in the province of Kherson, whose plea against military service is considered well grounded.  They are made to work off their term of service in labor in the forests.  But in the recent cases of refusal on the part of Mennonites to serve in the army on religious grounds, the government authorities have acted in the following manner:  To begin with, they have recourse to every means of coercion used in our times to \"correct\" the culprit and bring him to \"a better mind,\" and these measures are carried out with the greatest secrecy.  I know that in the case of one man who declined to serve in 1884 in Moscow, the official correspondence on the subject had two months after his refusal accumulated into a big folio, and was kept absolutely secret among the Ministry.  They usually begin by sending the culprit to the priests, and the latter, to their shame be it said, always exhort him to obedience. But since the exhortation in Christ's name to forswear Christ is for the most part unsuccessful, after he has received the admonitions of the spiritual authorities, they send him to the gendarmes, and the latter, finding, as a rule, no political cause for offense in him, dispatch him back again, and then he is sent to the learned men, to the doctors, and to the madhouse.  During all these vicissitudes he is deprived of liberty and has to endure every kind of humiliation and suffering as a convicted criminal. (All this has been repeated in four cases.)  The doctors let him out of the madhouse, and then every kind of secret shift is employed to prevent him from going free--whereby others would be encouraged to refuse to serve as he has done--and at the same time to avoid leaving him among the soldiers, for fear they too should learn from him that military service is not at all their duty by the law of God, as they are assured, but quite contrary to it.  The most convenient thing for the government would be to kill the non-resistant by flogging him to death or some other means, as was done in former days.  But to put a man openly to death because he believes in the creed we all confess is impossible.  To let a man alone who has refused obedience is also impossible.  And so the government tries either to compel the man by ill-treatment to renounce Christ, or in some way or other to get rid of him unobserved, without openly putting him to death, and to hide somehow both the action and the man himself from other people. And so all kinds of shifts and wiles and cruelties are set on foot against him.  They either send him to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],["title","\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#6)"],["body","or provoke him to insubordination, and then try him for breach of discipline and shut him up in the prison of the disciplinary battalion, where they can ill treat him freely unseen by anyone, or they declare him mad, and lock him up in a lunatic asylum.  They sent one man in this way to Tashkend--that is, they pretended to transfer to the Tashkend army; another to Omsk; a third him they convicted of insubordination and shut up in prison; a fourth they sent to a lunatic asylum.  Everywhere the same story is repeated.  Not only the government, but the great majority of liberal, advanced people, as they are called, studiously turn away from everything that has been said, written, or done, or is being done by men to prove the incompatibility of force in its most awful, gross, and glaring form--in the form, that is, of an army of soldiers prepared to murder anyone, whoever it may be--with the teachings of Christianity, or even of the humanity which society professes as its creed.  So that the information I have gained of the attitude of the higher ruling classes, not only in Russia but in Europe and America, toward the elucidation of this question has convinced me that there exists in these ruling classes a consciously hostile attitude to true Christianity, which is shown pre-eminently in their reticence in regard to all manifestations of it.     CHAPTER II.  CRITICISMS OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE ON THE PART OF BELIEVERS AND OF UNBELIEVERS.  Fate of the Book \"What I Believe\"--Evasive Character of Religious Criticisms of Principles of my Book--1st Reply: Use of Force not Opposed to Christianity--2d Reply: Use of Force Necessary to Restrain Evil Doers--3d Reply: Duty of Using Force in Defense of One's Neighbor--4th Reply: The Breach of the Command of Non-resistance to be Regarded Simply as a Weakness--5th Reply: Reply Evaded by Making Believe that the Question has long been Decided--To Devise such Subterfuges and to take Refuge Behind the Authority of the Church, of Antiquity, and of Religion is all that Ecclesiastical Critics can do to get out of the Contradiction between Use of Force and Christianity in Theory and in Practice--General Attitude of the Ecclesiastical World and of the Authorities to Profession of True Christianity--General Character of Russian Freethinking Critics--Foreign Freethinking Critics--Mistaken Arguments of these Critics the Result of Misunderstanding the True Meaning of Christ's Teaching.   The impression I gained of a desire to conceal, to hush up, what I had tried to express in my book, led me to judge the book itself afresh.  On its appearance it had, as I had anticipated, been forbidden, and ought therefore by law to have been burnt.  But, at the same time, it was discussed among officials, and circulated in a great number of manuscript and lithograph copies, and in translations printed abroad.  And very quickly after the book, criticisms, both religious and secular in character, made their appearance, and these the government tolerated, and even encouraged.  So that the refutation of a book which no one was supposed to know anything about was even chosen as the subject for theological dissertations in the academies.  The criticisms of my book, Russian and foreign alike, fall under two general divisions--the religious criticisms of men who regard themselves as believers, and secular criticisms, that is, those of freethinkers.  I will begin with the first class.  In my book I made it an accusation against the teachers of the Church that their teaching is opposed to Christ's commands clearly and definitely expressed in the Sermon on the Mount, and opposed in especial to his command in regard to resistance to evil, and that in this way they deprive Christ's teaching of all value.  The Church authorities accept the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount on non-resistance to evil by force as divine revelation; and therefore one would have thought that if they felt called upon to write about my book at all, they would have found it inevitable before everything else to reply to the principal point of my charge against them, and to say plainly, do they or do they not admit the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount and the commandment of non-resistance to evil as binding on a Christian.  And they were bound to answer this question, not after the usual fashion (i. e., \"that although on the one side one cannot absolutely deny, yet on the other side one cannot main fully assent, all the more seeing that,\" etc., etc.).  No; they should have answered the question as plainly as it was put in my book--Did Christ really demand from his disciples that they should carry out what he taught them in the Sermon on the Mount?  And can a Christian, then, or can he not, always remaining a Christian, go to law or make any use of the law, or seek his own protection in the law?  And can the Christian, or can he not, remaining a Christian, take part in the administration of government, using compulsion against his neighbors?  And--the most important question hanging over the heads of all of us in these days of universal military service--can the Christian, or can he not, remaining a Christian, against Christ's direct prohibition, promise obedience in future actions directly opposed to his teaching?  And can he, by taking his share of service in the army, prepare himself to murder men, and even actually murder them?  These questions were put plainly and directly, and seemed to require a plain and direct answer; but in all the criticisms of my book there was no such plain and direct answer.  No; my book received precisely the same treatment as all the attacks upon the teachers of the Church for their defection from the Law of Christ of which history from the days of Constantine is full.  A very great deal was said in connection with my book of my having incorrectly interpreted this and other passages of the Gospel, of my being in error in not recognizing the Trinity, the redemption, and the immortality of the soul.  A very great deal was said, but not a word about the one thing which for every Christian is the most essential question in life--how to reconcile the duty of forgiveness, meekness, patience, and love for all, neighbors and enemies alike, which is so clearly expressed in the words of our teacher, and in the heart of each of us--how to reconcile this duty with the obligation of using force in war upon men of our own or a foreign people.  All that are worth calling answers to this question can be brought under the following five heads.  I have tried to bring together in this connection all I could, not only from the criticisms on my book, but from what has been written in past times on this theme.  The first and crudest form of reply consists in the bold assertion that the use of force is not opposed by the teaching of Christ; that it is permitted, and even enjoined, on the Christian by the Old and New Testaments.  Assertions of this kind proceed, for the most part, from men who have attained the highest ranks in the governing or ecclesiastical hierarchy, and who are consequently perfectly assured that no one will dare to contradict their assertion, and that if anyone does contradict it they will hear nothing of the contradiction.  These men have, for the most part, through the intoxication of power, so lost the right idea of what that Christianity is in the name of which they hold their position that what is Christian in Christianity presents itself to them as heresy, while everything in the Old and New Testaments which can be distorted into an antichristian and heathen meaning they regard as the foundation of Christianity.  In support of their assertion that Christianity is not opposed to the use of force, these men usually, with the greatest audacity, bring together all the most obscure passages from the Old and New Testaments, interpreting them in the most unchristian way--the punishment of Ananias and Sapphira, of Simon the Sorcerer, etc.  They quote all those sayings of Christ's which can possibly be interpreted as justification of cruelty: the expulsion from the Temple; \"It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for this city,\" etc., etc.  According to these people's notions, a Christian government is not in the least bound to be guided by the spirit of peace, forgiveness of injuries, and love for enemies.  To refute such an assertion is useless, because the very people who make this assertion refute themselves, or, rather, renounce Christ, inventing a Christianity and a Christ of their own in the place of him in whose name the Church itself exists, as well as their office in it.  If all men were to learn that the Church professes to believe in a Christ of punishment and warfare, not of forgiveness, no one would believe in the Church and it could not prove to anyone what it is trying to prove.  The second, somewhat less gross, form of argument consists in declaring that, though Christ did indeed preach that we should turn the left cheek, and give the cloak also, and this is the highest moral duty, yet that there are wicked men in the world, and if these wicked men mere not restrained by force, the whole world and all good men would come to ruin through them.  This argument I found for the first time in John Chrysostom, and I show how he is mistaken in my book \"What I believe.\"  This argument is ill grounded, because if we allow ourselves to regard any men as intrinsically wicked men, then in the first place we annul, by so doing, the whole idea of the Christian teaching, according to which we are all equals and brothers, as sons of one father in heaven.  Secondly, it is ill founded, because even if to use force against wicked men had been permitted by God, since it is impossible to find a perfect and unfailing distinction by which one could positively know the wicked from the good, so it would come to all individual men and societies of men mutually regarding each"]]]
