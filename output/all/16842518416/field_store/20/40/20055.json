Grant, Complete (#2)"],["body","my father carried on the manufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned and tilled considerable land.  I detested the trade, preferring almost any other labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment in which horses were used.  We had, among other lands, fifty acres of forest within a mile of the village.  In the fall of the year choppers were employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month.  When I was seven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in the house and shops.  I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at that time, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one at the house unload.  When about eleven years old, I was strong enough to hold a plough.  From that age until seventeen I did all the work done with horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn and potatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood, besides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood for stoves, etc., while still attending school.  For this I was compensated by the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by my parents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting my grandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on the ice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground.  While still quite young I had visited Cincinnati, forty-five miles away, several times, alone; also Maysville, Kentucky, often, and once Louisville.  The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of that day.  I had also gone once with a two-horse carriage to Chilicothe, about seventy miles, with a neighbor's family, who were removing to Toledo, Ohio, and returned alone; and had gone once, in like manner, to Flat Rock, Kentucky, about seventy miles away.  On this latter occasion I was fifteen years of age.  While at Flat Rock, at the house of a Mr. Payne, whom I was visiting with his brother, a neighbor of ours in Georgetown, I saw a very fine saddle horse, which I rather coveted, and proposed to Mr. Payne, the owner, to trade him for one of the two I was driving.  Payne hesitated to trade with a boy, but asking his brother about it, the latter told him that it would be all right, that I was allowed to do as I pleased with the horses.  I was seventy miles from home, with a carriage to take back, and Mr. Payne said he did not know that his horse had ever had a collar on.  I asked to have him hitched to a farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work.  It was soon evident that the horse had never worn harness before; but he showed no viciousness, and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him.  A trade was at once struck, I receiving ten dollars difference.  The next day Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return.  We got along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dog that frightened the horses and made them run.  The new animal kicked at every jump he made.  I got the horses stopped, however, before any damage was done, and without running into anything.  After giving them a little rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.  That instant the new horse kicked, and started to run once more.  The road we were on, struck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the second runaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feet deep on the opposite side of the pike.  I got the horses stopped on the very brink of the precipice.  My new horse was terribly frightened and trembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as my companion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, and took passage on a freight wagon for Maysville.  Every time I attempted to start, my new horse would commence to kick.  I was in quite a dilemma for a time.  Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle who lived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point. Finally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universal use then--and with this blindfolded my horse.  In this way I reached Maysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of my friend.  Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day we proceeded on our journey.  About half my school-days in Georgetown were spent at the school of John D. White, a North Carolinian, and the father of Chilton White who represented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion. Mr. White was always a Democrat in politics, and Chilton followed his father.  He had two older brothers--all three being school-mates of mine at their father's school--who did not go the same way.  The second brother died before the rebellion began; he was a Whig, and afterwards a Republican.  His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldier during the rebellion.  Chilton is reported as having told of an earlier horse-trade of mine.  As he told the story, there was a Mr. Ralston living within a few miles of the village, who owned a colt which I very much wanted.  My father had offered twenty dollars for it, but Ralston wanted twenty-five.  I was so anxious to have the colt, that after the owner left, I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded. My father yielded, but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth, and told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offer twenty-two and a half, and if that would not get him, to give the twenty-five.  I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.  When I got to Mr. Ralston's house, I said to him:  \"Papa says I may offer you twenty dollars for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offer twenty-two and a half, and if you won't take that, to give you twenty-five.\"  It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the price finally agreed upon.  This story is nearly true.  I certainly showed very plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him.  I could not have been over eight years old at the time.  This transaction caused me great heart-burning. The story got out among the boys of the village, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it.  Boys enjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that day did, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from the peculiarity.  I kept the horse until he was four years old, when he went blind, and I sold him for twenty dollars.  When I went to Maysville to school, in 1836, at the age of fourteen, I recognized my colt as one of the blind horses working on the tread-wheel of the ferry-boat.  I have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of the whole.  I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, as grown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at the same time.  I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, and probably more than most of them.  I have no recollection of ever having been punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod.  But at school the case was different.  The rod was freely used there, and I was not exempt from its influence.  I can see John D. White--the school teacher --now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.  It was not always the same one, either.  Switches were brought in bundles, from a beech wood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they were intended.  Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day.  I never had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attending the school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.  Mr. White was a kindhearted man, and was much respected by the community in which he lived.  He only followed the universal custom of the period, and that under which he had received his own education.    CHAPTER II.  WEST POINT--GRADUATION.  In the winter of 1838-9 I was attending school at Ripley, only ten miles distant from Georgetown, but spent the Christmas holidays at home. During this vacation my father received a letter from the Honorable Thomas Morris, then United States Senator from Ohio.  When he read it he said to me, \"Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive the appointment.\"  \"What appointment?\"  I inquired.  \"To West Point; I have applied for it.\"  \"But I won't go,\" I said.  He said he thought I would, AND I THOUGHT SO TOO, IF HE DID.  I really had no objection to going to West Point, except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirements necessary to get through.  I did not believe I possessed them, and could not bear the idea of failing.  There had been four boys from our village, or its immediate neighborhood, who had been graduated from West Point, and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown, except in the case of the one whose place I was to take.  He was the son of Dr. Bailey, our nearest and most intimate neighbor.  Young Bailey had been appointed in 1837.  Finding before the January examination following, that he could not pass, he resigned and went to a private school, and remained there until the following year, when he was reappointed. Before the next examination he was dismissed.  Dr. Bailey was a proud and sensitive man, and felt the failure of his son so keenly that he forbade his return home.  There were no telegraphs in those days to disseminate news rapidly, no railroads west of the Alleghanies, and but few east; and above all, there were no reporters prying into other people's private affairs.  Consequently it did not become generally known that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until I was appointed.  I presume Mrs. Bailey confided to my mother the fact that Bartlett had been dismissed, and that the doctor had forbidden his son's return home.  The Honorable Thomas L. Hamer, one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced, was our member of Congress at the time, and had the right of nomination. He and my father had been members of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#3)"],["body","debating society (where they were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personal friends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politics they differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was a Whig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over some act of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, I think--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I know both of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been glad at any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make the advance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamer for the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United States Senator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed to fill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, as there was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healed the breach between the two, never after reopened.  Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to West Point--that \"he thought I would go\"--there was another very strong inducement.  I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already the best travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, John Walker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated back as soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texas he acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one would form going there now.  I had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve, in Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky, besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole country within fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me the opportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent, Philadelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places were visited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad collision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have received a temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, to enter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face the music.  Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, and has been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There was probably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity could have been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis for President of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any other representative of his party; unless it was immediately after some of John Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a few hours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever they could find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered meals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a far pleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a like service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Union element in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the churches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was preached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the government, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible. There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements for membership in these churches.  Yet this far-off western village, with a population, including old and young, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for the organization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearing arms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel, West Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers of Volunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, all had citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, except possibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from his graduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from other localities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe, Loudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents of Georgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive at the close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had preceded me at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his first engagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point from that village since my time has been graduated.  I took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about the middle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regular trips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length of time, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two or three days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one, drawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  On this occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three days Pittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal to Harrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave a better opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania, and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At that time the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with the comfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be more pleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphia there was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on which I had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over which canal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road from Harrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached. We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, and made the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an hour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days in Philadelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre, visited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), and got reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long. My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to see the city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st of May, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission, without difficulty, very much to my surprise.  A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea of staying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did not expect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic studies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of August came--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt as though I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid to graduation, I would have to remain always.  I did not take hold of my studies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the second time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my room doing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy from which cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted more time to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much of the time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of a trashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's, Marryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many others that I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so that when January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing in that branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the first year's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had been turned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I never succeeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any one study, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery, infantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.  Early in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a bill was discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this an honorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with much interest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I was selfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later, although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to have seen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure a detail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the Academy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some respectable college; but circumstances always did shape my course different from my plans.  At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extending from the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This I enjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out his business in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which my day-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be able to retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve miles away, in the adjoining county of Clermont, and had bought a young horse that had never been in harness, for my special use under the saddle during my furlough.  Most of my time was spent among my old school-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.  Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets is divided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises. These companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent and commandant selecting the officers for their military bearing and qualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelve lieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeants from"]]]
