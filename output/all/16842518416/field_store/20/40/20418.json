Love must be free to give, defer,   Himself alone his almoner.    \"As free I freely poured my all,   Enslaved I spurn, renounce my thrall,   Its wages and its bitter bread.\"   Thus whispered Love the day he fled!     OVERSHADOWED.  \"Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter, passing by, might overshadow some of them.\"     Mid the thronged bustle of the city street,     In the hot hush of noon,   I wait, with folded hands and nerveless feet.     Surely He will come soon.   Surely the Healer will not pass me by,   But listen to my cry.    Long are the hours in which I lie and wait,     Heavy the load I bear;   But He will come ere evening. Soon or late     I shall behold Him there;   Shall hear His dear voice, all the clangor through;   \"What wilt thou that I do?\"    \"If Thou but wilt, Lord, Thou canst make me clean.\"     Thus shall I answer swift.   And He will touch me, as He walks serene;     And I shall rise and lift   This couch, so long my prison-house of pain,   And be made whole again.    He lingers yet. But lo! a hush, a hum.     The multitudes press on   After some leader. Surely He is come!     He nears me; He is gone!   Only His shadow reached me, as He went;   Yet here I rest content.    In that dear shadow, like some healing spell,     A heavenly patience lay;   Its balm of peace enwrapped me as it fell;     My pains all fled away,--   The weariness, the deep unrest of soul;   I am indeed \"made whole.\"    It is enough, Lord, though Thy face divine     Was turned to other men.   Although no touch, no questioning voice was mine,     Thou wilt come once again;   And, if Thy shadow brings such bliss to me,   What must Thy presence be?     TIME TO GO.        They know the time to go!   The fairy clocks strike their inaudible hour   In field and woodland, and each punctual flower   Bows at the signal an obedient head       And hastes to bed.        The pale Anemone   Glides on her way with scarcely a good-night;   The Violets tie their purple nightcaps tight;   Hand clasped in hand, the dancing Columbines,       In blithesome lines,        Drop their last courtesies,   Flit from the scene, and couch them for their rest;   The Meadow Lily folds her scarlet vest   And hides it 'neath the Grasses' lengthening green;       Fair and serene,        Her sister Lily floats   On the blue pond, and raises golden eyes   To court the golden splendor of the skies,--   The sudden signal comes, and down she goes       To find repose,        In the cool depths below,   A little later, and the Asters blue   Depart in crowds, a brave and cheery crew;   While Golden-rod, still wide awake and gay,       Turns him away,        Furls his bright parasol,   And, like a little hero, meets his fate.   The Gentians, very proud to sit up late,   Next follow. Every Fern is tucked and set       'Neath coverlet,        Downy and soft and warm.   No little seedling voice is heard to grieve   Or make complaints the folding woods beneath;   No lingerer dares to stay, for well they know       The time to go.        Teach us your patience, brave,   Dear flowers, till we shall dare to part like you,   Willing God's will, sure that his clock strikes true,   That his sweet day augurs a sweeter morrow,       With smiles, not sorrow.     GULF-STREAM.    Lonely and cold and fierce I keep my way,     Scourge of the lands, companioned by the storm,   Tossing to heaven my frontlet, wild and gray,     Mateless, yet conscious ever of a warm   And brooding presence close to mine all day.    What is this alien thing, so near, so far,     Close to my life always, but blending never?   Hemmed in by walls whose crystal gates unbar     Not at the instance of my strong endeavor   To pierce the stronghold where their secrets are?    Buoyant, impalpable, relentless, thin,     Rise the clear, mocking walls. I strive in vain   To reach the pulsing heart that beats within,     Or with persistence of a cold disdain,   To quell the gladness which I may not win.    Forever sundered and forever one,     Linked by a bond whose spell I may not guess,   Our hostile, yet embracing currents run;     Such wedlock lonelier is than loneliness.   Baffled, withheld, I clasp the bride I shun.    Yet even in my wrath a wild regret     Mingles; a bitterness of jealous strife   Tinges my fury as I foam and fret     Against the borders of that calmer life,   Beside whose course my wrathful course is set.    But all my anger, all my pain and woe,     Are vain to daunt her gladness; all the while   She goes rejoicing, and I do not know,     Catching the soft irradiance of her smile,   If I am most her lover or her foe.     MY WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUM.    As purely white as is the drifted snow,      More dazzling fair than summer roses are,      Petalled with rays like a clear rounded star,   When winds pipe chilly, and red sunsets glow,        Your blossoms blow.    Sweet with a freshening fragrance, all their own,      In which a faint, dim breath of bitter lies,      Like wholesome breath mid honeyed flatteries;   When other blooms are dead, and birds have flown,         You stand alone.    Fronting the winter with a fearless grace,      Flavoring the odorless gray autumn chill,      Nipped by the furtive frosts, but cheery still,   Lifting to heaven from the bare garden place         A smiling face.    Roses are fair, but frail, and soon grow faint,      Nor can endure a hardness; violets blue,      Short-lived and sweet, live but a day or two;   The nun-like lily bows without complaint,         And dies a saint.    Each following each they hasten them away,      And leave us to our winter and our rue,      Sad and uncomforted; you, only you,   Dear, hardy lover, keep your faith and stay         Long as you may.    And so we choose you out from all the rest,      For that most noble word of \"Loyalty,\"      Which blazoned on your petals seems to be;   Winter is near,--stay with us; be our guest,         The last and best.     TILL THE DAY DAWN.    Why should I weary you, dear heart, with words,      Words all discordant with a foolish pain?   Thoughts cannot interrupt or prayers do wrong,      And soft and silent as the summer rain   Mine fall upon your pathway all day long.    Giving as God gives, counting not the cost      Of broken box or spilled and fragrant oil,   I know that, spite of your strong carelessness,      Rest must be sweeter, worthier must be toil,   Touched with such mute, invisible caress.    One of these days, our weary ways quite trod,      Made free at last and unafraid of men,   I shall draw near and reach to you my hand.      And you? Ah! well, we shall be spirits then,   I think you will be glad and understand.     MY BIRTHDAY.    Who is this who gently slips      Through my door, and stands and sighs,   Hovering in a soft eclipse,   With a finger on her lips     And a meaning in her eyes?    Once she came to visit me      In white robes with festal airs,   Glad surprises, songs of glee;   Now in silence cometh she,      And a sombre garb she wears.    Once I waited and was tired,      Chid her visits as too few;   Crownless now and undesired,   She to seek me is inspired      Oftener than she used to do.    Grave her coming is and still,      Sober her appealing mien,   Tender thoughts her glances fill;   But I shudder, as one will      When an open grave is seen.    Wherefore, friend,--for friend thou art,--      Should I wrong thee thus and grieve?   Wherefore push thee from my heart?   Of my morning thou wert part;      Be a part too of my eve.    See, I hold my hand to meet      That cool, shadowy hand of thine;   Hold it firmly, it is sweet   Thus to clasp and thus to greet,      Though no more in full sunshine.    Come and freely seek my door,      I will open willingly;   I will chide the past no more,   Looking to the things before,      Led by pathways known to thee.     BY THE CRADLE.    The baby Summer lies asleep and dreaming--      Dreaming and blooming like a guarded rose;   And March, a kindly nurse, though rude of seeming,   Is watching by the cradle hung with snows.    Her blowing winds but keep the rockers swinging,      And deepen slumber in the shut blue eyes,   And the shrill cadences of her high singing      Are to the babe but wonted lullabies.    She draws the coverlet white and tucks it trimly,      She folds the little sleeper safe from harm;   Or bends to lift the veil, and, peering inly,      Makes sure it lies all undisturbed and warm.    And so she sits, till in the still, gray dawning      Two fairer nurses come, her place to take,   And smiling, beaming, with no word of warning,      Draw off the quilt, and kiss the babe awake.     A THUNDER STORM.    The day was hot and the day was dumb,   Save for cricket's chirr or the bee's low hum,      Not a bird was seen or a butterfly,   And ever till noon was over, the sun      Glared down with a yellow and terrible eye;    Glared down in the woods, where the breathless boughs   Hung heavy and faint in a languid drowse,      And the ferns were curling with thirst and heat;   Glared down on the fields where the sleepy cows      Stood munching the grasses, dry and sweet.    Then a single cloud rose up in the west,   With a base of gray and a white, white crest;      It rose and it spread a mighty wing.   And swooped at the sun, though he did his best      And struggled and fought like a wounded thing.    And the woods awoke, and the sleepers heard,   Each heavily hanging leaflet stirred      With a little expectant quiver and thrill,   As the cloud bent over and uttered a word,--      One volleying, rolling syllable. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4560"],["title","Verses (#7)"],["body","   And once and again came the deep, low tone   Which only to thunder's lips is known,      And the earth held up her fearless face   And listened as if to a signal blown,--      A signal-trump in some heavenly place.    The trumpet of God, obeyed on high,   His signal to open the granary      And send forth his heavily loaded wains   Rambling and roaring down the sky      And scattering the blessed, long-harvested rains.      THROUGH THE DOOR.    The angel opened the door      A little way,   And she vanished, as melts a star,      Into the day,   And, for just a second's space,      Ere the bar he drew,   The pitying angel paused,      And we looked through.    What did we see within?      Ah! who can tell?   What glory and glow of light      Ineffable;   What peace in the very air,      What hush and calm,   Soothing each tired soul      Like healing balm!    Was it a dream we dreamed,      Or did we hear   The harping of silver harps,      Divinely clear?   A murmur of that \"new song,\"      Which, soft and low,   The happy angels sing,--      Sing as they go?    And, as in the legend old,      The good monk heard,   As he paced his cloister dim,      A heavenly bird,   And, rapt and lost in the joy      Of the wondrous song,   Listened a hundred years,      Nor deemed them long,    So chained in sense and limb,      All blind with sun,   We stood and tasted the joy      Of our vanished one;   And we took no note of time,      Till soon or late   The gentle angel sighed,      And shut the gate.    The vision is closed and sealed.      We are come back   To the old, accustomed earth,      The well-worn track,--   Back to the daily toil,      The daily pain,--   But we never can be the same,      Never again.    We who have bathed in noon,      All radiant white,   Shall we come back content      To sit in night?   Content with self and sin,      The stain, the blot?   To have stood so near the gate      And enter not?    O glimpse so swift, so sweet,      So soon withdrawn!   Stay with us; light our dusks      Till day shall dawn;   Until the shadows flee,      And to our view   Again the gate unbars,      And we pass through.     READJUSTMENT.    After the earthquake shock or lightning dart   Comes a recoil of silence o'er the lands,   And then, with pulses hot and quivering hands,   Earth calls up courage to her mighty heart,   Plies every tender, compensating art,   Draws her green, flowery veil above the scar,   Fills the shrunk hollow, smooths the riven plain,   And with a century's tendance heals again   The seams and gashes which her fairness mar.   So we, when sudden woe like lightning sped,   Finds us and smites us in our guarded place,   After one brief, bewildered moment's space,   By the same heavenly instinct taught and led,   Adjust our lives to loss, make friends with pain,   Bind all our shattered hopes and bid them bloom again.     AT THE GATE  \"For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"         Thy kingdom here?       Lord, can it be?   Searching and seeking everywhere       For many a year,   \"Thy kingdom come\" has been my prayer.   Was that dear kingdom all the while so near?        Blinded and dull       With selfish sin,   Have I been sitting at the gates       Called Beautiful,   Where Thy fair angel stands and waits,   With hand upon the lock to let me in?        Was I the wall       Which barred the way,   Darkening the glory of Thy grace,       Hiding the ray   Which, shining out as from Thy very face,   Had shown to other men the perfect day?        Was I the bar       Which shut me out   From the full joyance which they taste       Whose spirits are   Within Thy Paradise embraced,--   Thy blessed Paradise, which seemed so far?        The vision swells:       I seem to catch   Celestial breezes, rustling low,       The asphodels,   Where, singing softly ever to and fro,   Moves each fair saint who in Thy presence dwells.        Let me not sit       Another hour,   Idly awaiting what is mine to win,       Blinded in wit,   Lord Jesus, rend these walls of self and sin;   Beat down the gate, that I may enter it.     A HOME.    What is a home? A guarded space,     Wherein a few, unfairly blest,   Shall sit together, face to face,     And bask and purr and be at rest?    Where cushioned walls rise up between     Its inmates and the common air,   The common pain, and pad and screen     From blows of fate or winds of care?    Where Art may blossom strong and free,     And Pleasure furl her silken wing,   And every laden moment be     A precious and peculiar thing?    And Past and Future, softly veiled     In hiding mists, shall float and lie   Forgotten half, and unassailed     By either hope or memory,    While the luxurious Present weaves     Her perfumed spells untried, untrue,   Broiders her garments, heaps her sheaves,     All for the pleasure of a few?    Can it be this, the longed-for thing     Which wanderers on the restless foam,   Unsheltered beggars, birds on wing,     Aspire to, dream of, christen \"Home\"?    No. Art may bloom, and peace and bliss;     Grief may refrain and Death forget;   But if there be no more than this,     The soul of home is wanting yet.    Dim image from far glory caught,     Fair type of fairer things to be,   The true home rises in our thought,     A beacon set for men to see.    Its lamps burn freely in the night,     Its fire-glows unchidden shed   Their cheering and abounding light     On homeless folk uncomforted.    Each sweet and secret thing within     Gives out a fragrance on the air,--   A thankful breath, sent forth to win     A little smile from others' care.    The few, they bask in closer heat;     The many catch the farther ray.   Life higher seems, the world more sweet,     And hope and Heaven less far away.    So the old miracle anew     Is wrought on earth and proved good,   And crumbs apportioned for a few,     God-blessed, suffice a multitude.     THE LEGEND OF KINTU.    When earth was young and men were few,   And all things freshly born and new   Seemed made for blessing, not for ban,   Kintu, the god, appeared as man.   Clad in the plain white priestly dress,   He journeyed through the wilderness,   His wife beside. A mild-faced cow   They drove, and one low-bleating lamb;   He bore a ripe banana-bough,   And she a root of fruitful yam:   This was their worldly worth and store,   But God can make the little more.   The glad earth knew his feet; her mould   Trembled with quickening thrills, and stirred.   Miraculous harvests spread and rolled,   The orchards shone with ruddy gold;   The flocks increased, increased the herd,   And a great nation spread and grew   From the swift lineage of the two,   Peopling the solitary place;   A fair and strong and fruitful race,   Who knew not pain nor want nor grief,   And Kintu reigned their lord and chief.    So sped three centuries along,   Till Kintu's sons waxed fierce and strong;   They learned to war, they loved to slay;   Cruel and dark grew all their faces;   Discordant death-cries scared the day,   Blood stained the green and holy places;   And drunk with lust, with anger hot,   His sons mild Kintu heeded not.   At last the god arose in wrath,   His sandals tied, and down the path,   His wife beside him, as of yore,   He went. A cow, a single lamb   They took; one tuber of the yam;   One yellow-podded branch they bore   Of ripe banana,--these, no more,   Of all the heaped-up harvest store.   They left the huts, they left the tent,   Nor turned, nor cast a backward look:   Behind, the thick boughs met and shook.   They vanished. Long with wild lament   Mourned all the tribe, in vain, in vain;   The gift once given was given no more,   The grieved god came not again.    To what far paradise they fared,   That heavenly pair, what wilderness   Their gentle rule next owned and shared,   Knoweth no man,--no man can guess.   On secret roads, by pathways blind,   The gods go forth, and none may find;   But sad the world where God is not!   By man was Kintu soon forgot,   Or named and held as legend dim,   But the wronged earth, remembering him,   By scanty fruit and tardy grain   And silent song revealed her pain.   So centuries came, and centuries went,   And heaped the graves and filled the tent.   Kings rose, and fought their royal way   To conquest over heaps of slain,   And reigned a little. Then, one day,   They vanished into dust again.   And other kings usurped their place,   Who called themselves of Kintu's race,   And worshipped Kintu; not as he,   The mild, benignant deity,   Who held all life a holy thing,   Be it of insect or of king,   Would have ordained, but with wild rite,   With altars heaped, and dolorous cries,   And savage dance, and bale-fires light,   An unaccepted sacrifice.   At last, when thousand years were flown,   The great Ma-anda filled the throne:   A prince of generous heart and high,   Impetuous, noble, fierce, and true;   His wrath like lightning hurtling by,   His pardon like the healing dew.   And chiefs and sages swore each one   He was great Kintu's worthiest son.    One night, in forests still and deep,   A shepherd sat to watch his sheep,   And started, as through darkness dim   A strange voice rang and calmed to him:   \"Wake! there are wonders waiting thee!   Go where the thick mimosas be,   Fringing a little open plain,   Honor and power wouldest thou gain?   Go, foolish man, to fortune blind;   Follow the stream, and thou shall find.\"   Three several nights the voice was heard,   Louder and more emphatic grown.   Then, at the thrice-repeated word,   The shepherd rose and went alone,   Threading the mazes of the stream   Like one who wanders in a dream.   Long miles he ran, the stream beside,   Which this way, that way, turned and sped,   And called and sang, a noisy guide.   At last its vagrant dances led   To where the thick mimosas' shade   Circled and fringed an open glade;   There the wild streamlet danced away,   The moon was shining"]]]
