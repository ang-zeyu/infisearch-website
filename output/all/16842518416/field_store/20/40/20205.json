In every      instance they have resisted our laws, and in every State      necessity demanded their expulsion.       \"In Utah, while they were charged with the administration of      the government and execution of the laws, they proved      themselves not only traitors to our people, but treacherous to      the government, and openly rebelled against them and defied      their authority, and it cost the Federal Government millions      to conquer them. They have still control of the Territory, and      they are inflexibly bent upon subduing the Anti-Mormons of      Western Utah; and if the latter are not separated from them,      and protected by law, it will require the expenditure of      millions more to restore order in Utah. Congress can count the      cost in this matter, while we will have the melancholy duty of      burying our dead. The people of Nevada will never be      conquered,--never be ruled by the Mormons. Come what will,      they will resist to the bitter end. They prefer death to      dishonor, and the government may choose which of these shall      be meted out to them.       \"In addition to the above considerations, which should, I      believe, present conclusive and imposing evidence,      sufficiently satisfactory to induce Congress to organize the      Territory of Nevada, I may likewise mention others.       \"While the people of Western Utah have, in the Mormons, open      and avowed enemies, they have likewise the savage tribes to      defend themselves against. Some of these tribes are professed      Mormons, while others are under their influence. Many      conflicts have taken place between the Christians and some of      these tribes, as well as between the emigrants, while crossing      the Plains to the North Pacific, and the aforesaid savages;      and there is no hope of establishing amicable relations with      these Indian tribes, until they are brought under other and      better relations with the Anti-Mormons of Utah. Peace does not      reign in Utah, and never will, under the present order of      things. . . . .       \"When our common country shall call forth her sons to defend      her rights, the people of Nevada will come forth. They will be      ready and willing to meet the enemy, on the beach and on the      frontier, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other.      They will dispute every inch of ground, burn every blade of      grass, and the last intrenchment of liberty will become their      graves, rather than permit a foreign enemy to contaminate the      soil of our country. Can this be said of the Mormons? I think      not. If we can protect our countrymen abroad, why should we      not, on our own soil?       \"Very respectfully, yours,       \"JAMES M. CRANE,       \"_Delegate elect from Nevada_.       \"To Hon. Wm. Smith.\"              *       *       *       *       *       \"Having read the above statement of Judge Crane, delegate from      the proposed Territory of Nevada, I will state from my own      observation, having resided in the Territory of Utah for over      three years, for a portion of which time I was in Carson      Valley, that I heartily concur with him, and fully indorse his      statement in relation to the condition of things in Western      Utah, and seriously believe that the wants and necessities of      the people of that portion of the Territory demand its      immediate organization.       \"GEORGE P. STILES,       \"_Late Associate Justice for Utah_.\"  Nevada was erected into a Territory, and has made rapid and gigantic strides in all the essentials of a high civilization. Her mines are celebrated throughout the world, and she annually adds millions of dollars to the circulation of the country.  Already are her valleys teeming with the life of the husbandman, and her soil yielding up its rich harvests of golden grain, for the sustenance of her brave and patriotic sons. She has sent several hundred men into the field, and with unshaken loyalty stands ready to send more, if the cause of her country calls,--thus literally fulfilling the promise of Judge Crane made in the foregoing letter. Mark the contrast between loyal and Christian Nevada, and disloyal and Mohammedan Utah! One rushing on to a glorious and happy destiny, and the other falling rapidly back into the habits and customs of heathen nations. The genius of Liberty sits enthroned among the mountains of free Nevada, while despotism of the most hideous character clanks her chains in Utah. May the day of deliverance for the oppressed thousands of Utah soon dawn. Then will she take her place among her sisters in the family of States, and the hand of oppression be no more felt in all her fair borders.  When Brigham Young found that the gentile element was gaining ground rapidly in Carson County, his Legislature attached it to Great Salt Lake County, for judicial and other purposes. A large number of Mormons were sent on to colonize, and if possible to retain, the fertile Valley of Nevada. These missionaries were recalled in 1857, as well as many others, who were settling in different parts of California.  Slowly and sullenly they relinquished their hold upon this rich and prosperous portion of the Republic. It rapidly advanced in population, and not only prospered as a Territory, as already mentioned, but has lately been admitted as one of the States of the Union. The admission of Nevada, carved out of Utah, while the mother Territory still remains out in the cold, ought to be a sufficient hint that Congress and the people of the United States are not yet prepared for the establishment in their midst of a polygamic monarchy.  Judge Stiles returned to Salt Lake City, and there held several courts.  In the fall of 1856 a conflict arose, in regard to the jurisdiction of the United States Marshal. Heretofore this officer had acted with the Mormons, and all had passed off smoothly. But a real gentile was now appointed, and this was the signal for Mormon opposition. The Mormons claimed that the Territorial Marshal, instead of the United States Marshal, should act in the United States courts when doing territorial business. The United States Marshal contended that he should officiate in all business transacted in the United States courts, whether sitting as federal or territorial courts. Judge Stiles issued certain writs, directed to the officer, which he found it impossible to serve. The people, instigated by the Mormon leaders, refused to obey the precepts of the court, and set at naught its authority, proclaiming that the time had come when their laws, and none others, should be enforced in Utah.  The question of jurisdiction was brought before the court, and James Ferguson, Hosea Stout, and J. C. Little, Mormon lawyers, loudly demanded that the Judge should decide in their favor. Ferguson, backed by an armed mob, told Judge Stiles, in open court, that if he dared to decide contrary to their wishes, he \"would take him from the bench d--d quick\"; that the boys were there to do it, and he, with others, by threats and intimidations, finally compelled the Judge to adjourn his court.  Judge Stiles then appealed to Brigham Young, as Governor of the Territory, to sustain him, and protect him in the discharge of his duties. In reply, he was coolly told that \"the courts had already cost him [Brigham] too much trouble; that the boys had got their spunk up, and he would not interfere.\" He advised him, \"if he could not sustain and enforce their [the United States] laws and institutions, the sooner he adjourned his court the better.\"  These proceedings had a tendency to bring the Judge into disrepute with the Mormons. Thomas Williams, a lawyer, had his office with Judge Stiles, on Main Street. Williams, though a Mormon, was an independent man, and had openly opposed Brigham on some question of politics. He had also denounced some prominent murders, and was becoming obnoxious, and even dangerous, to Brigham and his compeers. The Prophet once said to Williams's father and mother: \"If Tom don't behave himself better, and stop causing me trouble, I must attend to him.\" Soon after, Williams apostatized, and started for California, intending to remain, and send back for his family. He met the fate of Babbitt. He was waylaid and killed by \"Indians\" on the Plains. It is well understood at Salt Lake that these were white Indians, and that Williams was put to death by order of the church authorities.  The records of the United States District Courts were in Judge Stiles's office. He, and Williams also, had a good many law books, which were private property. Brigham asserted that the records were suffered to \"lie around loose,\" and suggested to the boys that they had better be cared for. This was sufficient, and \"the boys\" proceeded to \"'tend to it.\" James Ferguson, Hiram B. Clawson, and several others, repaired to the office of the Judge when he was absent, and stationing one of the number to watch, they gathered up the records of the courts, first of all, and conveyed them to a fire-and-burglar-proof-safe, belonging to Young, and under the control of Clawson, who was his confidential clerk and son-in-law.  Having deposited them safely, they returned, and taking some of the Judge's papers, tore them in pieces, and scattered them over the floor, and in the direction of an outhouse. About the same time a large number of the law books found their way into the houses of certain Mormon lawyers, where they have ever since remained. They then took some of the books from the office, and placed them in the outhouse, set fire to the building, and burned it to the ground.

THE INTERVIEW XLII.     THE SHADOW OF CONSPIRACY XLIII.    THE LAST MEETING IN MILAN XLIV.     THE WIFE AND THE HUSBAND XLV.      SHOWS MANY PATHS CONVERGING TO THE END XLVI.     THE LAST           EPILOGUE    CHAPTER XL  THROUGH THE WINTER  Weisspriess and Wilfrid made their way toward Milan together, silently smoking, after one attempt at conversation, which touched on Vittoria's marriage; but when they reached Monza the officer slapped his degraded brother in arms upon the shoulder, and asked him whether he had any inclination to crave permission to serve in Hungary.  For his own part, Weisspriess said that he should quit Italy at once; he had here to skewer the poor devils, one or two weekly, or to play the mightily generous; in short, to do things unsoldierly; and he was desirous of getting away from the country.  General Schoneck was at Monza, and might arrange the matter for them both.  Promotion was to be looked for in Hungary; the application would please the General; one battle would restore the lieutenant's star to Wilfrid's collar.  Wilfrid, who had been offended by his companion's previous brooding silence, nodded briefly, and they stopped at Monza, where they saw General Schoneck in the morning, and Wilfrid being by extraordinary favour in civilian's dress during his leave of absence, they were jointly invited to the General's table at noon, though not to meet any other officer.  General Schoneck agreed with Weisspriess that Hungary would be a better field for Wilfrid; said he would do his utmost to serve them in the manner they wished, and dismissed them after the second cigar.  They strolled about the city, glad for reasons of their own to be out of Milan as long as the leave permitted.  At night, when they were passing a palace in one of the dark streets, a feather, accompanied by a sharp sibilation from above, dropped on Wilfrid's face.  Weisspriess held the feather up, and judged by its length that it was an eagle's, and therefore belonging to the Hungarian Hussar regiment stationed in Milan.  \"The bird's aloft,\" he remarked. His voice aroused a noise of feet that was instantly still.  He sent a glance at the doorways, where he thought he discerned men.  Fetching a whistle in with his breath, he unsheathed his sword, and seeing that Wilfrid had no weapon, he pushed him to a gate of the palace-court that had just cautiously turned a hinge.  Wilfrid found his hand taken by a woman's hand inside.  The gate closed behind him.  He was led up to an apartment where, by the light of a darkly-veiled lamp, he beheld a young Hungarian officer and a lady clinging to his neck, praying him not to go forth.  Her Italian speech revealed how matters stood in this house.  The officer accosted Wilfrid: \"But you are not one of us!\"  He repeated it to the lady: \"You see, the man is not one of us!\"  She assured him that she had seen the uniform when she dropped the feather, and wept protesting it.  \"Louis, Louis! why did you come to-night! why did I make you come!  You will be slain.  I had my warning, but I was mad.\"  The officer hushed her with a quick squeeze of her inter-twisted fingers.  \"Are you the man to take a sword and be at my back, sir?\" he said; and resumed in a manner less contemptuous toward the civil costume: \"I request it for the sole purpose of quieting this lady's fears.\"  Wilfrid explained who and what he was.  On hearing that he was General Pierson's nephew the officer laughed cheerfully, and lifted the veil from the lamp, by which Wilfrid knew him to be Colonel Prince Radocky, a most gallant and the handsomest cavalier in the Imperial service.  Radocky laughed again when he was told of Weisspriess keeping guard below.  \"Aha!  we are three, and can fight like a pyramid.\"  He flourished his hand above the lady's head, and called for a sword. The lady affected to search for one while he stalked up and down in the jaunty fashion of a Magyar horseman; but the sword was not to be discovered without his assistance, and he was led away in search of it. The moment he was alone Wilfrid burst into tears.  He could bear anything better than the sight of fondling lovers.  When they rejoined him, Radocky had evidently yielded some point; he stammered and worked his underlip on his moustache.  The lady undertook to speak for him.  Happily for her, she said, Wilfrid would not compromise her; and taking her lover's hand, she added with Italian mixture of wit and grace: \"Happily for me, too, he does.  The house is surrounded by enemies; it is a reign of terror for women.  I am dead, if they slay him; but if they recognize him, I am lost.\"  Wilfrid readily leaped to her conclusion.  He offered his opera-hat and civil mantle to Radocky, who departed in them, leaving his military cloak in exchange.  During breathless seconds the lady hung kneeling at the window.  When the gate opened there was a noise as of feet preparing to rush; Weisspriess uttered an astonished cry, but addressed Radocky as \"my Pierson!\" lustily and frequently; and was heard putting a number of meaningless questions, laughing and rallying Pierson till the two passed out of hearing unmolested.  The lady then kissed a Cross passionately, and shivered Wilfrid's manhood by asking him whether he knew what love was.  She went on:  \"Never, never love a married woman!  It's a past practice.  Never! Thrust a spike in the palm of your hands drink scalding oil, rather than do that.\"  \"The Prince Radocky is now safe,\" Wilfrid said.  \"Yes, he is safe; and he is there, and I am here: and I cannot follow him; and when will he come to me?\"  The tones were lamentable.  She struck her forehead, after she had mutely thrust her hand to right and left to show the space separating her from her lover.  Her voice changed when she accepted Wilfrid's adieux, to whose fate in the deadly street she appeared quite indifferent, though she gave him one or two prudent directions, and expressed a hope that she might be of service to him.  He was set upon as soon as he emerged from the gateway; the cavalry cloak was torn from his back, and but for the chance circumstance of his swearing in English, he would have come to harm.  A chill went through his blood on hearing one of his assailants speak the name of Barto Rizzo. The English oath stopped an arm that flashed a dagger half its length. Wilfrid obeyed a command to declare his name, his country, and his rank. It's not the prince! it's not the Hungarian!\" went many whispers; and he was drawn away by a man who requested him to deliver his reasons for entering the palace, and who appeared satisfied by Wilfrid's ready mixture of invention and fact.  But the cloak!  Wilfrid stated boldly that the cloak was taken by him from the Duchess of Graatli's at Como; that he had seen a tall Hussar officer slip it off his shoulders; that he had wanted a cloak, and had appropriated it.  He had entered the gate of the palace because of a woman's hand that plucked at the skirts of this very cloak.  \"I saw you enter,\" said the man; \"do that no more.  We will not have the blood of Italy contaminated--do you hear?  While that half-Austrian Medole is tip-toeing 'twixt Milan and Turin, we watch over his honour, to set an example to our women and your officers.  You have outwitted us to-night.  Off with you!\"  Wilfrid was twirled and pushed through the crowd till he got free of them.  He understood very well that they were magnanimous rascals who could let an accomplice go, though they would have driven steel into the principal.  Nothing came of this adventure for some time.  Wilfrid's reflections (apart from the horrible hard truth of Vittoria's marriage, against which he dashed his heart perpetually, almost asking for anguish) had leisure to examine the singularity of his feeling a commencement of pride in the clasping of his musket;--he who on the first day of his degradation had planned schemes to stick the bayonet-point between his breast-bones: he thought as well of the queer woman's way in Countess Medole's adjuration to him that he should never love a married woman;--in her speaking, as it seemed, on his behalf, when it was but an outcry of her own acute wound. Did he love a married woman?  He wanted to see one married woman for the last time; to throw a frightful look on her; to be sublime in scorn of her; perhaps to love her all the better for the cruel pain, in the expectation of being consoled.  While doing duty as a military machine, these were the pictures in his mind; and so well did his routine drudgery enable him to bear them, that when he heard from General Schoneck that the term of his degradation was to continue in Italy, and from his sister that General Pierson refused to speak of him or hear of him until he had regained his gold shoulder-strap, he revolted her with an ejaculation of gladness, and swore brutally that he desired to have no advancement; nothing but sleep and drill; and, he added conscientiously, Havannah cigars.  \"He has grown to be like a common soldier,\" Adela said to herself with an amazed contemplation of the family tie.  Still, she worked on his behalf, having, as every woman has, too strong an instinct as to what is natural to us to believe completely in any eccentric assertion.  She carried the tale of his grief and trials and his romantic devotion to the Imperial flag, daily to Countess Lena; persisting, though she could not win a responsive look from Lena's face.  One day on the review-ground, Wilfrid beheld Prince Radocky bending from his saddle in conversation with Weisspriess.  The prince galloped up to General Pierson, and stretched his hand to where Wilfrid was posted as marker to a wheeling column, kept the hand stretched out, and spoke furiously, and followed the General till he was ordered to head his regiment.  Wilfrid began to hug his musket less desperately.  Little presents--feminine he knew by the perfumes"]]]
