And when the crowded, sunlit day at last   Left the field lonely with its trampled flowers,   Into the chapel's peace the brothers passed   To quell the memory of those hurrying hours.   \"Our holy time,\" they said, \"once more is ours!   Come, let us pay our debt of prayer and praise,   Forgetting in God's light the darkness of man's ways!\"    But, ere their voices reached the first psalm's end,   They heard a new, strange rustling round their house;   Then came the porter: \"Here comes many a friend,   Pushing aside your budding orchard boughs;   Come, brothers, justify your holy vows.   Here be God's patient, poor, four-footed things   Seek healing at God's well, whence loving-kindness springs.\"    Then cried the Abbot in a vexed amaze,   \"Our brethren we must aid, if 'tis God's will;   But the wild creatures of the forest ways   Himself God heals with His Almighty skill.   And charity is good, and love--but still   God shall not look in vain for the white prayers   We send on silver feet to climb the starry stairs;    \"For, of all worthy things, prayer has most worth,   It rises like sweet incense up to heaven,   And from God's hand falls back upon the earth,   Being of heavenly bread the accepted leaven.   Through prayer is virtue saved and sin forgiven;   In prayer the impulse and the force are found   That bring in purple and gold the fruitful seasons round.    \"For prayer comes down from heaven in the sun   That giveth life and joy to all things made;   Prayer falls in rain to make broad rivers run   And quickens the seeds in earth's brown bosom laid;   By prayer the red-hung branch is earthward weighed,   By prayer the barn grows full, and full the fold,   For by man's prayer God works his wonders manifold.\"    The porter seemed to bow to the reproof;   But when the echo of the night's last prayer   Died in the mystery of the vaulted roof,   A whispered memory in the hallowed air,   The Abbot turned to find him standing there.   \"Brother,\" he said, \"I have healed the woodland things   And they go happy and whole--blessing Love's ministerings,    \"And, having healed them, I shall crave your leave   To leave you--for to-night I journey far.   But I have kept your gate this Easter Eve,   And now your house to heaven shines like a star   To show the Angels where God's children are;   And in this day your house has served God more   Than in the praise and prayer of all its years before.    \"Yet I must leave you, though I fain would stay,   For there are other gates I go to keep   Of houses round whose walls, long day by day,   Shut out of hope and love, poor sinners weep--   Barred folds that keep out God's poor wandering sheep--   I must teach these that gates where God comes in   Must not be shut at all to pain, or want, or sin.    \"The voice of prayer is very soft and weak,   And sorrow and sin have voices very strong;   Prayer is not heard in heaven when those twain speak,   The voice of prayer faints in the voice of wrong   By the just man endured--oh, Lord, how long?--   If ye would have your prayers in heaven be heard,   Look that wrong clamour not with too intense a word.    \"But when true love is shed on want and sin,   Their cry is changed, and grows to such a voice   As clamours sweetly at heaven to be let in--   Such sound as makes the saints in heaven rejoice;   Pure gold of prayer, purged of the vain alloys   Of idleness--that is the sound most dear   Of all the earthly sounds God leans from heaven to hear.    \"Oh, brother, I must leave thee, and for me   The work is heavy, and the burden great.   Thine be this charge I lay upon thee: See   That never again stands barred thy abbey gate;   Look that God's poor be not left desolate;   Ah me! that chidden my shepherds needs must be   When my poor wandering sheep have so great need of me.    \"Brother, forgive thy Brother if he chide,   Thy Brother loves thee--and has loved--for see   The nails are in my hands, and in my side   The spear-wound; and the thorns weigh heavily   Upon my brow--brother, I died for thee--   For thee, and for my sheep that are astray,   And rose to live for thee, and them, on Easter Day!\"    \"My Master and my Lord!\" the Abbot cried.   But, where that face had been, shone the new day;   Only on the marble by the Abbot's side,   Where those dear feet had stood, a lily lay--   A lily white for the white Easter Day.   He sought the gate--no sorrow clamoured there--   And, not till then, he dared to sink his soul in prayer.    And from that day himself he kept the gate   Wide open; and the poor from far and wide,   The weary, and wicked, and disconsolate,   Came there for succour and were not denied;   The sick were healed, the repentant sanctified;   And from their hearts rises more prayer and praise   Than ever the abbey knew in all its prayer-filled days.    And there the Heavenly vision comes no more,   Only, each Easter now, a lily sweet   Lies white and dewy on the chancel floor   Where once had stood the beloved wounded feet;   And the old Abbot feels the nearing beat   Of wings that bring him leave at last to go   And meet his Master, where the immortal lilies grow.     VIA AMORIS.    I.    IT is not Love, this beautiful unrest,   This tremor of longing that invades my breast:   For Love is in his grave this many a year,   He will not rise--I do not wish him here.   It is not memory, for your face and eyes   Are not reflected where that dark pool lies:   It is not hope, for life makes no amends,   And hope and I are long no longer friends:   It is a ghost out of another Spring   It needs but little for its comforting--   That I should hold your hand and see your face   And muse a little in this quiet place,   Where, through the silence, I can hear you sigh   And feel you sadden, O Virgin Mystery,   And know my thought has in your thought begot   Sadness, its child, and that you know it not.    II.    If this were Love, if all this bitter pain   Were but the birth-pang of Love born again,   If through the doubts and dreams resolved, smiled   The prophetic promise of the holy child,   What should I gain? The Love whose dream-lips smiled   Could never be my own and only child,   But to Love's birth would come, with the last pain,   Renunciation, also born again.    III.    If this were Love why should I turn away?   Am I not, too, made of the common clay?   Is life so fair, am I so fortunate,   I can refuse the capricious gift of Fate,   The sudden glory, the unhoped-for flowers,   The transfiguration of my earthly hours?    Come, Love! the house is garnished and is swept,   Washed clean with all the tears that I have wept,   Washed from the stain of my unworthy fears,   Hung with the splendid spoils of wasted years,   Lighted with lamps of hope, and curtained fast   Against the gathered darkness of the past.    I draw the bolts! I throw the portals wide,   The darkness rushes shivering to my side,   Love is not here--the darkness creeps about   My house wherein the lamps of hope die out.   Ah Love! it was not then your hand that came   Beating my door? your voice that called my name?    IV.    \"It is not Love, it is not Love,\" I said,   And bowed in fearful hope my trembling head.   \"It is not Love, for Love could never rise   Out of the rock-hewn grave wherein he lies.\"   But as I spake, the heavenly form drew near   Where close I clasped a hope grown keen as fear,   Upon my head His very hand He laid   And whispered, \"It is I, be not afraid!\"    V.    And this is Love, no rose-crowned laughing guest   By whom my passionate heart should be caressed,   But one re-risen from the grave; austere,   Cold as the grave, and infinitely dear,   To follow whom I lay the whole world down,   Take up the cross, bind on the thorny crown;   And, following whom, my bleeding pilgrim feet   Find the rough pathway sure and very sweet.   The august environment of mighty wings   Shuts out the snare of vain imaginings,   For by my side, crowned with Love's death-white rose,   The Angel of Renunciation goes.     RETRO SATHANAS.    \"REFUSE, refrain: for this is not the love   The Annunciation Angel warned you of;   This is the little candle, not the sun;   It burns, but will not warm, unhappy one!\"    \"But ah! suppose the sun should never shine,   Then what an anguish of regret were mine   To know that even from this I turned away!   Candles may serve, if there should be no day.\"    \"Nay, better to go cold your whole life long   Than do the sun, than do your soul such wrong:   And if the sun shine not, be life's the blame   And yours the pride, who scorned the meaner flame.\"     THE OLD DISPENSATION.    O THOU, who, high in heaven,   To man hast given   This clouded earthly life   All storm and strife,   Blasted with ice and fire,   Love and desire,   Filled with dead faith, and love   That change is master of--    O Thou, who mightest have given   To all Thy heaven,   But who, instead, didst give   This life we live--   Who feedest with blood and tears   The hungry years--   I make one prayer to Thee,   O Great God! grant it me.    Some day when summer shows   Her leaf, her rose,   God, let Thy sinner lie   Under Thy sky,   And feel Thy sun's large grace   Upon his face;   Then grant him this, that he   May not believe in Thee!     THE NEW DISPENSATION.    OUT in the sun the buttercups are gold,   The daisies silver all the grassy lane,   And spring has given love a flower to hold,   And love lays blindness on the eyes of pain.    Within are still, chill aisles and blazoned panes   And carven tombs where memory weeps no more.   And from the lost and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4513"],["title","The Rainbow and the Rose (#7)"],["body","days remains   One saint beside the long-closed western door.    Outside the world goes laughing lest it weep,   With here and there some happy child at play;   A mother worshipping the babe asleep,   Or two young lovers dreaming 'neath the May.    Within, the soul of love broods o'er the place;   The carven saint forgotten many a year   Still lifts to heaven his rapt adoring face   To pray, for those who leave him lonely here,    That once again the silent church may ring   With songs of joy triumphant over pain--   Ah! God, who makest the miracle of spring   Make Thou dead faith and love to rise again.     THE THREE KINGS.    WHEN the star in the East was lit to shine   The three kings journeyed to Palestine;    They came from the uttermost parts of earth   With long trains laden with gifts of worth.    The first king rode on a camel's back,   He came from the land where the kings are black,    Bringing treasures desired of kings,   Rubies and ivory and precious things.    An elephant carried the second king,   He came from the land of the sun-rising,    And gems and gold and spices he bare   With broidered raiment for kings to wear.    The third king came without steed or train   From the misty land where the white kings reign.    He bore no gifts save the myrrh in his hand,   For he came on foot from a far-off land.    Now when they had travelled a-many days   Through tangled forests and desert ways,    By angry seas and by paths thorn-set   On Christmas Vigil the three kings met.    And over their meeting a shrouded sky   Made dark the star they had travelled by.    Then the first king spake and he frowned and said:   \"By some ill spell have our feet been led,    \"Now I see in the darkness the fools we are   To follow the light of a lying star.    \"Let us fool no more, but like kings and men   Each get him home to his land again!\"    Then the second king with the weary face,   Gold-tinct as the sun of his reigning place,    Lifted sad eyes to the clouds and said,   \"It was but a dream and the dream is sped.    \"We dreamed of a star that rose new and fair,   But it sets in the night of the old despair.    \"Yet night is faithful though stars betray,   It will lead to our kingdoms far away.\"    Then spake the king who had fared alone   From the far-off kingdom, the white-hung throne:    \"O brothers, brothers, so very far   Ye have followed the light of the radiant star,    \"And because for a while ye see it not   Shall its faithful shining be all forgot?    \"On the spirit's pathway the light still lies   Though the star be hid from our longing eyes.    \"To-morrow our star will be bright once more   The little pin-hole in heaven's floor--    \"The Angels pricked it to let it bring   Our feet to the throne of the new-born King!\"    And the first king heard and the second heard   And their hearts grew humble before the third.    And they laid them down beside bale and beast   and their sleeping eyes saw light in the East.    For the Angels fanned them with starry wings   And the waft of visions of unseen things.    And the next gold day waned trembling and white   And the star was born of the waxing night.    And the three kings came where the Great King lay,   A little baby among the hay,    The ox and the ass were standing near   And Mary Mother beside her Dear.    Then low in the litter the kings bowed down,   They gave Him gold for a kingly crown,    And frankincense for a great God's breath   and Myrrh to sweeten the day of death.    The Maiden Mother she stood and smiled   And she took from the manger her little child.    On the dark king's head she laid His hand   And anger died at that dear command.    She laid His hand on the gold king's head   And despair itself was comforted.    But when the pale king knelt in the stall   She heard on the straw his tears down fall.    And she stooped where he knelt beside her feet   And laid on his bosom her baby sweet.    And the king in the holy stable-place   Felt the little lips through the tears on his face.         *     *     *     *     *     *     *    Christ! lay Thy hand on the angry king   Who reigns in my breast to my undoing,    And lay thy hands on the king who lays   The spell of sadness on all my days,    And give the white king my soul, Thy soul,   Of these other kings the high control.    That soul and spirit and sense may meet   In adoration before Thy feet!    Now Glory to God the Father Most High,   And the Star, the Spirit, He leads us by.    And to God's dear Son, the Babe who was born   And laid in the manger on Christmas morn!       IX.     AFTER DEATH.    IF we must part, this parting is the best:   How would you bear to lay   Your head on some warm pillow far away--   Your head, so used to lying on my breast?    But now your pillow is cold;   Your hands have flowers, and not my hands, to hold;   Upon our bed the worn bride-linen lies.   I have put the death-money upon your eyes,   So that you should not wake up in the night.   I have bound your face with white;   I have washed you, yes, with water and not with tears,--   Those arms wherein I have slept so many years,   Those feet that hastened when they came to me,   And all your body that belonged to me.   I have smoothed your dear dull hair,   And there is nothing left to say for you   And nothing left to fear or pray for you;   And I have got the rest of life to bear:   Thank God it is you, not I, who are lying there.    If I had died   And you had stood beside   This still white bed   Where the white, scented, horrible flowers are spread,--   I know the thing it is,   And I thank God that He has spared you this.   If one must bear it, thank God it was I   Who had to live and bear to see you die,   Who have to live, and bear to see you dead.    You will have nothing of it all to bear:   You will not even know that in your bed   You lie alone. You will not miss my head   Beside you on the pillow: you will rest   So soft in the grave you will not miss my breast.   But I--but I--Your pillow and your place--   And only the darkness laid against my face,   And only my anguish pressed against my side--   Thank God, thank God, that it was you who died!     CHLOE.    NIGHT wind sighing through the poplar leaves,   Trembling of the aspen, shivering of the willow,   Every leafy voice of all the night-time grieves,   Mourning, weeping over Chloe's pillow.    Chloe, fresher than the breeze of dawn,   Fairer than the larches in their young spring glory,   Brighter than the glow-worms on the dewy lawn,   Hear the dirge the green trees sing to end your story:--    \"Chloe lived and Chloe loved: she brought new gladness,   Hope and life and all things good to all who met her;   Only, dying, wept to know the lifelong sadness   Willed, against her will, to those who can't forget her.\"     INVOCATION.    COME to-night in a dream to-night,   Come as you used to do,   Come in the gown, in the gown of white,   Come in the ribbon of blue;   Come in the virgin's colours you wear,   Come through the dark and the dew,   Come with the scent of the night in your hair,   Come as you used to do.    Blue and white of your eyes and your face,   White of your gown and blue,   Will you not come from the happy place,   Come as you used to do?   Tears so many, so many tears   Where there were once so few--   Can they not wash the gray of the years   From the white of your gown and blue?     THE LAST BETRAYAL.    AND I shall lie alone at last,   Clear of the stream that ran so fast,   And feel the flower roots in my hair,   And in my hands the roots of trees;   Myself wrapt in the ungrudging peace   That leaves no pain uncovered anywhere.    What--this hope left? this way not barred?   This last best treasure without guard?   This heaven free--no prayers to pay?   Fool--are the Rulers of men asleep?   Thou knowest what tears They bade thee weep,   But, when peace comes, 'tis thou wilt sleep, not They.     A PRAYER FOR THE KING'S MAJESTY.    22nd January, 1901.    THE Queen is dead. God save the King,   In this his hour of grief,   When sorrow gathers memories in a sheaf   To lay them on his shoulders as he stands   Inheriting her glories and her lands--   First gain of his at which his Mother's voice   Has not been first to bless and to rejoice--   A man, set lonely between gain and loss.   (O words of love the heart remembereth,   O mighty loss outweighing every gain!)   A Son whose kingdom Death's arm lies across,   A King whose Mother lies alone with Death   Wrapped in the folds of white implacable sleep.   O God, who seest the tears Thy children weep,   O God, who countest each sad heart-beat, see   How our King needs the grace we ask of Thee!   Thou knowest how little and how vain a thing   Is Empire, when the heart is sick with pain--   God, save the King!   The Queen is dead. The splendour of her days,   The sorrow of them both alike merge now   In the new aureole that lights her brow.   The clamour of her people's voice in praise   Must hush itself to the still voice that prays   In the holy chamber of Death. Tread softly here,   A mighty Queen lies dead.   Her people's heart wears black,   The black bells toll unceasing in their ear,   And on the gold sun's track   The great world round   Like a black ring the voice of mourning goes,   Till even our ancient foes   With eyes downbent, and brotherly bared head,   Keep mourning watch with us. This is the hour   When Love lends all his power   To speed grief's arrows from the bow of Death,   When sighs are idle breath,   When tears are fountains vain.   She will not wake again,   Not now, not here.   O great and good and infinitely dear,   O Mother of your people, sleep is sweet,   No more Life's thorny ways will wound your feet.    O Mother dear, sleep sound!   When you shall wake,   Your brows freed from the crown that made them ache   So many a time, and wear the heavenly crown,   Then, then you will look down   On us who love you, and, remembering,   The love of "]]]
