It would be more delight    To have died in Cleopatra’s arms       Than be alive to-night.     I KNOW NOT HOW, BUT AS I COUNT      I KNOW not how, but as I count       The beads of former years,    Old laughter catches in my throat       With the very feel of tears.     SPRING SONG      THE air was full of sun and birds,       The fresh air sparkled clearly.    Remembrance wakened in my heart       And I knew I loved her dearly.     The fallows and the leafless trees       And all my spirit tingled.    My earliest thought of love, and Spring’s       First puff of perfume mingled.     In my still heart the thoughts awoke,       Came lone by lone together—    Say, birds and Sun and Spring, is Love       A mere affair of weather?     THE SUMMER SUN SHONE ROUND ME      THE summer sun shone round me,       The folded valley lay    In a stream of sun and odour,       That sultry summer day.     The tall trees stood in the sunlight       As still as still could be,    But the deep grass sighed and rustled       And bowed and beckoned me.     The deep grass moved and whispered       And bowed and brushed my face.    It whispered in the sunshine:       “The winter comes apace.”     YOU LOOKED SO TEMPTING IN THE PEW      YOU looked so tempting in the pew,       You looked so sly and calm—    My trembling fingers played with yours       As both looked out the Psalm.     Your heart beat hard against my arm,       My foot to yours was set,    Your loosened ringlet burned my cheek       Whenever they two met.     O little, little we hearkened, dear,       And little, little cared,    Although the parson sermonised,       The congregation stared.     LOVE’S VICISSITUDES      AS Love and Hope together       Walk by me for a while,    Link-armed the ways they travel       For many a pleasant mile—    Link-armed and dumb they travel,       They sing not, but they smile.     Hope leaving, Love commences       To practise on the lute;    And as he sings and travels       With lingering, laggard foot,    Despair plays obligato       The sentimental flute.     Until in singing garments       Comes royally, at call—    Comes limber-hipped Indiff’rence       Free stepping, straight and tall—    Comes singing and lamenting,       The sweetest pipe of all.     DUDDINGSTONE      WITH caws and chirrupings, the woods       In this thin sun rejoice.    The Psalm seems but the little kirk       That sings with its own voice.     The cloud-rifts share their amber light       With the surface of the mere—    I think the very stones are glad       To feel each other near.     Once more my whole heart leaps and swells       And gushes o’er with glee;    The fingers of the sun and shade       Touch music stops in me.     Now fancy paints that bygone day       When you were here, my fair—    The whole lake rang with rapid skates       In the windless winter air.     You leaned to me, I leaned to you,       Our course was smooth as flight—    We steered—a heel-touch to the left,       A heel-touch to the right.     We swung our way through flying men,       Your hand lay fast in mine:    We saw the shifting crowd dispart,       The level ice-reach shine.     I swear by yon swan-travelled lake,       By yon calm hill above,    I swear had we been drowned that day       We had been drowned in love.     STOUT MARCHES LEAD TO CERTAIN ENDS      STOUT marches lead to certain ends,    We seek no Holy Grail, my friends—    That dawn should find us every day    Some fraction farther on our way.     The dumb lands sleep from east to west,    They stretch and turn and take their rest.    The cock has crown in the steading-yard,    But priest and people slumber hard.     We two are early forth, and hear    The nations snoring far and near.    So peacefully their rest they take,    It seems we are the first awake!     —Strong heart! this is no royal way,    A thousand cross-roads seek the day;    And, hid from us, to left and right,    A thousand seekers seek the light.     AWAY WITH FUNERAL MUSIC      AWAY with funeral music—set       The pipe to powerful lips—    The cup of life’s for him that drinks       And not for him that sips.     TO SYDNEY      NOT thine where marble-still and white    Old statues share the tempered light    And mock the uneven modern flight,       But in the stream    Of daily sorrow and delight       To seek a theme.     I too, O friend, have steeled my heart    Boldly to choose the better part,    To leave the beaten ways of art,       And wholly free    To dare, beyond the scanty chart,       The deeper sea.     All vain restrictions left behind,    Frail bark! I loose my anchored mind    And large, before the prosperous wind       Desert the strand—    A new Columbus sworn to find       The morning land.     Nor too ambitious, friend.  To thee    I own my weakness.  Not for me    To sing the enfranchised nations’ glee,       Or count the cost    Of warships foundered far at sea       And battles lost.     High on the far-seen, sunny hills,    Morning-content my bosom fills;    Well-pleased, I trace the wandering rills       And learn their birth.    Far off, the clash of sovereign wills       May shake the earth.     The nimble circuit of the wheel,    The uncertain poise of merchant weal,    Heaven of famine, fire and steel       When nations fall;    These, heedful, from afar I feel—       I mark them all.     But not, my friend, not these I sing,    My voice shall fill a narrower ring.    Tired souls, that flag upon the wing,       I seek to cheer:    Brave wines to strengthen hope I bring,       Life’s cantineer!     Some song that shall be suppling oil    To weary muscles strained with toil,    Shall hearten for the daily moil,       Or widely read    Make sweet for him that tills the soil       His daily bread.     Such songs in my flushed hours I dream    (High thought) instead of armour gleam    Or warrior cantos ream by ream       To load the shelves—    Songs with a lilt of words, that seem       To sing themselves.     HAD I THE POWER THAT HAVE THE WILL      HAD I the power that have the will,       The enfeebled will—a modern curse—    This book of mine should blossom still       A perfect garden-ground of verse.     White placid marble gods should keep       Good watch in every shadowy lawn;    And from clean, easy-breathing sleep       The birds should waken me at dawn.     —A fairy garden;—none the less       Throughout these gracious paths of mine    All day there should be free access       For stricken hearts and lives that pine;     And by the folded lawns all day—       No idle gods for such a land—    All active Love should take its way       With active Labour hand in hand.     O DULL COLD NORTHERN SKY      O DULL cold northern sky,       O brawling sabbath bells,    O feebly twittering Autumn bird that tells       The year is like to die!     O still, spoiled trees, O city ways,       O sun desired in vain,    O dread presentiment of coming rain       That cloys the sullen days!     Thee, heart of mine, I greet.       In what hard mountain pass    Striv’st thou?  In what importunate morass       Sink now thy weary feet?     Thou run’st a hopeless race       To win despair.  No crown    Awaits success, but leaden gods look down       On thee, with evil face.     And those that would befriend       And cherish thy defeat,    With angry welcome shall turn sour the sweet       Home-coming of the end.     Yea, those that offer praise       To idleness, shall yet    Insult thee, coming glorious in the sweat       Of honourable ways.     APOLOGETIC POSTSCRIPT OF A YEAR LATER      IF you see this song, my dear,       And last year’s toast,    I’m confoundedly in fear    You’ll be serious and severe       About the boast.     Blame not that I sought such aid       To cure regret.    I was then so lowly laid    I used all the Gasconnade       That I could get.     Being snubbed is somewhat smart,       Believe, my sweet;    And I needed all my art    To restore my broken heart       To its conceit.     Come and smile, dear, and forget       I boasted so,    I apologise—regret—    It was all a jest;—and—yet—       I do not know.     TO MARCUS      YOU have been far, and I          Been farther yet,       Since last, in foul or fair       An impecunious pair,    Below this northern sky          Of ours, we met.     Now winter night shall see          Again us two,       While howls the tempest higher,       Sit warmly by the fire    And dream and plan, as we          Were wont to do.     And, hand in hand, at large          Our thoughts shall walk       While storm and gusty rain,       Again and yet again,    Shall drive their noisy charge          Across the talk.     The pleasant future still          Shall smile to me,       And hope with wooing hands       Wave on to fairy lands    All over dale and hill          And earth and sea.     And you who doubt the sky          And fear the sun—       You—Christian with the pack—       You shall not wander back    For I am Hopeful—I          Will cheer you on.     Come—where the great have trod,          The great shall lead—       Come, elbow through the press,       Pluck Fortune by the dress—    By God, we must—by God,          We shall succeed.     TO OTTILIE      YOU remember, I suppose,    How the August sun arose,       And how his face    Woke to trill and carolette    All the cages that were set       About the place.     In the tender morning light    All around lay strange and bright       And still and sweet,    And the gray doves unafraid    Went their morning promenade       Along the street.     THIS GLOOMY NORTHERN DAY      THIS gloomy northern day,       Or this yet gloomier night,          Has moved a something high          In my cold heart; and I,    That do not often pray,       Would pray to-night.     And first on Thee I call       For bread, O God of might!          Enough of bread for all,—         "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/441"],["title","New Poems, and Variant Readings (#3)"],["body"," That through the famished town    Cold hunger may lie down       With none to-night.     I pray for hope no less,       Strong-sinewed hope, O Lord,          That to the struggling young          May preach with brazen tongue    Stout Labour, high success,       And bright reward.     And last, O Lord, I pray       For hearts resigned and bold          To trudge the dusty way—          Hearts stored with song and joke    And warmer than a cloak       Against the cold.     If nothing else he had,       He who has this, has all.          This comforts under pain;          This, through the stinging rain,    Keeps ragamuffin glad       Behind the wall.     This makes the sanded inn       A palace for a Prince,          And this, when griefs begin          And cruel fate annoys,    Can bring to mind the joys       Of ages since.     THE WIND IS WITHOUT THERE AND HOWLS IN THE TREES      THE wind is without there and howls in the trees,       And the rain-flurries drum on the glass:    Alone by the fireside with elbows on knees       I can number the hours as they pass.    Yet now, when to cheer me the crickets begin,       And my pipe is just happily lit,    Believe me, my friend, tho’ the evening draws in,       That not all uncontested I sit.     Alone, did I say?  O no, nowise alone       With the Past sitting warm on my knee,    To gossip of days that are over and gone,       But still charming to her and to me.    With much to be glad of and much to deplore,       Yet, as these days with those we compare,    Believe me, my friend, tho’ the sorrows seem more       They are somehow more easy to bear.     And thou, faded Future, uncertain and frail,       As I cherish thy light in each draught,    His lamp is not more to the miner—their sail       Is not more to the crew on the raft.    For Hope can make feeble ones earnest and brave,       And, as forth thro’ the years I look on,    Believe me, my friend, between this and the grave,       I see wonderful things to be done.     To do or to try; and, believe me, my friend,       If the call should come early for me,    I can leave these foundations uprooted, and tend       For some new city over the sea.    To do or to try; and if failure be mine,       And if Fortune go cross to my plan,    Believe me, my friend, tho’ I mourn the design       I shall never lament for the man.     A VALENTINE’S SONG      MOTLEY I count the only wear       That suits, in this mixed world, the truly wise,    Who boldly smile upon despair       And shake their bells in Grandam Grundy’s eyes.    Singers should sing with such a goodly cheer       That the bare listening should make strong like wine,    At this unruly time of year,       The Feast of Valentine.     We do not now parade our “oughts”       And “shoulds” and motives and beliefs in God.    Their life lies all indoors; sad thoughts       Must keep the house, while gay thoughts go abroad,    Within we hold the wake for hopes deceased;       But in the public streets, in wind or sun,    Keep open, at the annual feast,       The puppet-booth of fun.     Our powers, perhaps, are small to please,       But even negro-songs and castanettes,    Old jokes and hackneyed repartees       Are more than the parade of vain regrets.    Let Jacques stand Wert(h)ering by the wounded deer—       We shall make merry, honest friends of mine,    At this unruly time of year,       The Feast of Valentine.     I know how, day by weary day,       Hope fades, love fades, a thousand pleasures fade.    I have not trudged in vain that way       On which life’s daylight darkens, shade by shade.    And still, with hopes decreasing, griefs increased,       Still, with what wit I have shall I, for one,    Keep open, at the annual feast,       The puppet-booth of fun.     I care not if the wit be poor,       The old worn motley stained with rain and tears,    If but the courage still endure       That filled and strengthened hope in earlier years;    If still, with friends averted, fate severe,       A glad, untainted cheerfulness be mine    To greet the unruly time of year,       The Feast of Valentine.     Priest, I am none of thine, and see       In the perspective of still hopeful youth    That Truth shall triumph over thee—       Truth to one’s self—I know no other truth.    I see strange days for thee and thine, O priest,       And how your doctrines, fallen one by one,    Shall furnish at the annual feast       The puppet-booth of fun.     Stand on your putrid ruins—stand,       White neck-clothed bigot, fixedly the same,    Cruel with all things but the hand,       Inquisitor in all things but the name.    Back, minister of Christ and source of fear—       We cherish freedom—back with thee and thine    From this unruly time of year,       The Feast of Valentine.     Blood thou mayest spare; but what of tears?       But what of riven households, broken faith—    Bywords that cling through all men’s years       And drag them surely down to shame and death?    Stand back, O cruel man, O foe of youth,       And let such men as hearken not thy voice    Press freely up the road to truth,       The King’s highway of choice.     HAIL! CHILDISH SLAVES OF SOCIAL RULES      HAIL!  Childish slaves of social rules       You had yourselves a hand in making!    How I could shake your faith, ye fools,       If but I thought it worth the shaking.    I see, and pity you; and then       Go, casting off the idle pity,    In search of better, braver men,       My own way freely through the city.     My own way freely, and not yours;       And, careless of a town’s abusing,    Seek real friendship that endures       Among the friends of my own choosing.    I’ll choose my friends myself, do you hear?       And won’t let Mrs. Grundy do it,    Tho’ all I honour and hold dear       And all I hope should move me to it.     I take my old coat from the shelf—       I am a man of little breeding.    And only dress to please myself—       I own, a very strange proceeding.    I smoke a pipe abroad, because       To all cigars I much prefer it,    And as I scorn your social laws       My choice has nothing to deter it.     Gladly I trudge the footpath way,       While you and yours roll by in coaches    In all the pride of fine array,       Through all the city’s thronged approaches.    O fine religious, decent folk,       In Virtue’s flaunting gold and scarlet,    I sneer between two puffs of smoke,—       Give me the publican and harlot.     Ye dainty-spoken, stiff, severe       Seed of the migrated Philistian,    One whispered question in your ear—       Pray, what was Christ, if you be Christian?    If Christ were only here just now,       Among the city’s wynds and gables    Teaching the life he taught us, how       Would he be welcome to your tables?     I go and leave your logic-straws,       Your former-friends with face averted,    Your petty ways and narrow laws,       Your Grundy and your God, deserted.    From your frail ark of lies, I flee       I know not where, like Noah’s raven.    Full to the broad, unsounded sea       I swim from your dishonest haven.     Alone on that unsounded deep,       Poor waif, it may be I shall perish,    Far from the course I thought to keep,       Far from the friends I hoped to cherish.    It may be that I shall sink, and yet       Hear, thro’ all taunt and scornful laughter,    Through all defeat and all regret,       The stronger swimmers coming after.     SWALLOWS TRAVEL TO AND FRO      SWALLOWS travel to and fro,    And the great winds come and go,    And the steady breezes blow,       Bearing perfume, bearing love.    Breezes hasten, swallows fly,    Towered clouds forever ply,    And at noonday, you and I       See the same sunshine above.     Dew and rain fall everywhere,    Harvests ripen, flowers are fair,    And the whole round earth is bare       To the moonshine and the sun;    And the live air, fanned with wings,    Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings    Into contact distant things,       And makes all the countries one.     Let us wander where we will,    Something kindred greets us still;    Something seen on vale or hill       Falls familiar on the heart;    So, at scent or sound or sight,    Severed souls by day and night    Tremble with the same delight—       Tremble, half the world apart.     TO MESDAMES ZASSETSKY AND GARSCHINE      THE wind may blaw the lee-gang way    And aye the lift be mirk an’ gray,    An deep the moss and steigh the brae       Where a’ maun gang—    There’s still an hoor in ilka day       For luve and sang.     And canty hearts are strangely steeled.    By some dikeside they’ll find a bield,    Some couthy neuk by muir or field       They’re sure to hit,    Where, frae the blatherin’ wind concealed,       They’ll rest a bit.     An’ weel for them if kindly fate    Send ower the hills to them a mate;    They’ll crack a while o’ kirk an’ State,       O’ yowes an’ rain:    An’ when it’s time to take the gate,       Tak’ ilk his ain.     —Sic neuk beside the southern sea    I soucht—sic place o’ quiet lee    Frae a’ the winds o’ life.  To me,       Fate, rarely fair,    Had set a freendly company       To meet me there.     Kindly by them they gart me sit,    An’ blythe was I to bide a bit.    Licht as o’ some hame fireside lit       My life for me.    —Ower early maun I rise an’ quit       This happy lee.     TO MADAME GARSCHINE      WHAT is the face, the fairest face, till Care,       Till Care the graver—Care with cunning hand,    Etches content thereon and makes it fair,       Or constancy, and love, and makes it grand?     MUSIC AT THE VILLA MARINA      FOR some abiding central source of power,       Strong-smitten steady chords, ye seem to flow       And, flowing, carry virtue.  Far below,    The vain tumultuous passions of the hour    Fleet fast and disappear; and as the sun       Shines on the wake of tempests, there is cast       O’er all the shattered ruins of my past    A strong"]]]
