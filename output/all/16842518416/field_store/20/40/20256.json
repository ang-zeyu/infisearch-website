Such an enterprise indicated that the queen, despite her subtlety, knew nothing of the laws of mystic logic.  Not in all history can one cite an example of a belief destroyed or reduced by means of refutation.  Catherine did not even know that although toleration is with difficulty possible between individuals, it is impossible between collectivities.  Her attempt failed completely.  The assembled theologians hurled texts and insults at one another's heads, but no one was moved. Catherine thought to succeed better in 1562 by promulgating an edict according Protestants the right to unite in the public celebration of their cult.  This tolerance, very admirable from a philosophical point of view, but not at all wise from the political standpoint, had no other result beyond exasperating both parties.  In the Midi, where the Protestants were strongest, they persecuted the Catholics, sought to convert them by violence, cut their throats if they did not succeed, and sacked their cathedrals.  In the regions where the Catholics were more numerous the Reformers suffered like persecutions.  Such hostilities as these inevitably engendered civil war.  Thus arose the so-called religious wars, which so long spilled the blood of France.  The cities were ravaged, the inhabitants massacred, and the struggle rapidly assumed that special quality of ferocity peculiar to religious or political conflicts, which, at a later date, was to reappear in the wars of La Vendee.  Old men, women, and children, all were exterminated.  A certain Baron d'Oppede, first president of the Parliament of Aix, had already set an example by killing 3,000 persons in the space of ten days, with refinements of cruelty, and destroying three cities and twenty-two villages.  Montluc, a worthy forerunner of Carrier, had the Calvinists thrown living into the wells until these were full.  The Protestants were no more humane.  They did not spare even the Catholic churches, and treated the tombs and statues just as the delegates of the Convention were to treat the royal tombs of Saint Denis.  Under the influence of these conflicts France was progressively disintegrated, and at the end of the reign of Henri III. was parcelled out into veritable little confederated municipal republics, forming so many sovereign states.  The royal power was vanishing.  The States of Blois claimed to dictate their wishes to Henri III., who had fled from his capital.  In 1577 the traveller Lippomano, who traversed France, saw important cities-- Orleans, Tours, Blois, Poitiers--entirely devastated, the cathedrals and churches in ruins, and the tombs shattered.  This was almost the state of France at the end of the Directory.  Among the events of this epoch, that which has left the darkest memory, although it was not perhaps the most murderous, was the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572, ordered, according to the historians, by Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX.  One does not require a very profound knowledge of psychology to realise that no sovereign could have ordered such an event.  St. Bartholomew's Day was not a royal but a popular crime.  Catherine de Medicis, believing her existence and that of the king threatened by a plot directed by four or five Protestant leaders then in Paris, sent men to kill them in their houses, according to the summary fashion of the time.  The massacre which followed is very well explained by M. Battifol in the following terms:--  ``At the report of what was afoot the rumour immediately ran through Paris that the Huguenots were being massacred; Catholic gentlemen, soldiers of the guard, archers, men of the people, in short all Paris, rushed into the streets, arms in hand, in order to participate in the execution, and the general massacre commenced, to the sound of ferocious cries of `The Huguenots! Kill, kill!'  They were struck down, they were drowned, they were hanged.  All that were known as heretics were so served.  Two thousand persons were killed in Paris.''  By contagion, the people of the provinces imitated those of Paris, and six to eight thousand Protestants were slain.  When time had somewhat cooled religious passions, all the historians, even the Catholics, spoke of St. Bartholomew's Day with indignation.  They thus showed how difficult it is for the mentality of one epoch to understand that of another.  Far from being criticised, St. Bartholomew's Day provoked an indescribable enthusiasm throughout the whole of Catholic Europe.  Philip II. was delirious with joy when he heard the news, and the King of France received more congratulations than if he had won a great battle.  But it was Pope Gregory XIII. above all who manifested the keenest satisfaction.  He had a medal struck to commemorate the happy event,[2] ordered joy-fires to be lit and cannon fired, celebrated several masses, and sent for the painter Vasari to depict on the walls of the Vatican the principal scenes of carnage.  Further, he sent to the King of France an ambassador instructed to felicitate that monarch upon his fine action.  It is historical details of this kind that enable us to comprehend the mind of the believer.  The Jacobins of the Terror had a mentality very like that of Gregory XIII.    [2] The medal must have been distributed pretty widely, for the cabinet of medals at the Bibliotheque Nationale possesses three examples: one in gold, one in silver, and one in copper. This medal, reproduced by Bonnani in his Numism. Pontific. (vol. i. p. 336), represents on one side Gregory XIII., and on the other an angel striking Huguenots with a sword.  The exergue is Ugonotorum strages, that is, Massacre of the Huguenots. (The word strages may be translated by carnage or massacre, a sense which it possesses in Cicero and Livy; or again by disaster, ruin, a sense attributed to it in Virgil and Tacitus.)    Naturally the Protestants were not indifferent to such a hecatomb, and they made such progress that in 1576 Henri III. was reduced to granting them, by the Edict of Beaulieu, entire liberty of worship, eight strong places, and, in the Parliaments, Chambers composed half of Catholics and half of Huguenots.  These forced concessions did not lead to peace.  A Catholic League was created, having the Duke of Guise at its head, and the conflict continued.  But it could not last for ever.  We know how Henri IV. put an end to it, at least for a time, by his abjuration in 1593, and by the Edict of Nantes.  The struggle was quieted but not terminated.  Under Louis XIII. the Protestants were still restless, and in 1627 Richelieu was obliged to besiege La Rochelle, where 15,000 Protestants perished.  Afterwards, possessing more political than religious feeling, the famous Cardinal proved extremely tolerant toward the Reformers.  This tolerance could not last.  Contrary beliefs cannot come into contact without seeking to annihilate each other, as soon as one feels capable of dominating the other.  Under Louis XIV. the Protestants had become by far the weaker, and were forced to renounce the struggle and live at peace.  Their number was then about 1,200,000, and they possessed more than 600 churches, served by about 700 pastors.  The presence of these heretics on French soil was intolerable to the Catholic clergy, who endeavoured to persecute them in various ways.  As these persecutions had little result, Louis XIV. resorted to dragonnading them in 1685, when many individuals perished, but without further result.  Under the pressure of the clergy, notably of Bossuett, the Edict of Nantes was revoked, and the Protestants were forced to accept conversion or to leave France. This disastrous emigration lasted a long time, and is said to have cost France 400,000 inhabitants, men of notable energy, since they had the courage to listen to their conscience rather than their interests.   6.  The results of Religious Revolutions.   If religious revolutions were judged only by the gloomy story of the Reformation, we should be forced to regard them as highly disastrous.  But all have not played a like part, the civilising influence of certain among them being considerable.  By giving a people moral unity they greatly increase its material power.  We see this notably when a new faith, brought by Mohammed, transforms the petty and impotent tribes of Arabia into a formidable nation.  Such a new religious belief does not merely render a people homogeneous.  It attains a result that no philosophy, no code ever attained: it sensibly transforms what is almost unchangeable, the sentiments of a race.  We see this at the period when the most powerful religious revolution recorded by history overthrew paganism to substitute a God who came from the plains of Galilee.  The new ideal demanded the renunciation of all the joys of existence in order to acquire the eternal happiness of heaven.  No doubt such an ideal was readily accepted by the poor, the enslaved, the disinherited who were deprived of all the joys of life here below, to whom an enchanting future was offered in exchange for a life without hope.  But the austere existence so easily embraced by the poor was also embraced by the rich.  In this above all was the power of the new faith manifested.  Not only did the Christian revolution transform manners: it also exercised, for a space of two thousand years, a preponderating influence over civilisation.  Directly a religious faith triumphs all the elements of civilisation naturally adapt themselves to it, so that civilisation is rapidly transformed.  Writers, artists and philosophers merely symbolise, in their works, the ideas of the new faith.  When any religious or political faith whatsoever has triumphed, not only is reason powerless to affect it, but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],["title","The Psychology of Revolution (#6)"],["body"," even finds motives which impel it to interpret and so justify the faith in question, and to strive to impose it upon others.  There were probably as many theologians and orators in the time of Moloch, to prove the utility of human sacrifices, as there were at other periods to glorify the Inquisition, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the hecatombs of the Terror.  We must not hope to see peoples possessed by strong beliefs readily achieve tolerance.  The only people who attained to toleration in the ancient world were the polytheists.  The nations which practise toleration at the present time are those that might well be termed polytheistical, since, as in England and America, they are divided into innumerable sects. Under identical names they really adore very different deities.  The multiplicity of beliefs which results in such toleration finally results also in weakness.  We therefore come to a psychological problem not hitherto resolved: how to possess a faith at once powerful and tolerant.  The foregoing brief explanation reveals the large part played by religious revolutions and the power of beliefs.  Despite their slight rational value they shape history, and prevent the peoples from remaining a mass of individuals without cohesion or strength.  Man has needed them at all times to orientate his thought and guide his conduct.  No philosophy has as yet succeeded in replacing them.    CHAPTER III  THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENTS IN REVOLUTIONS  1.  The feeble resistance of Governments in time of Revolution.  Many modern nations--France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland, Japan, Turkey, Portugal, &c.--have known revolutions within the last century.  These were usually characterised by their instantaneous quality and the facility with which the governments attacked were overthrown.  The instantaneous nature of these revolutions is explained by the rapidity of mental contagion due to modern methods of publicity. The slight resistance of the governments attacked is more surprising.  It implies a total inability to comprehend and foresee created by a blind confidence in their own strength.  The facility with which governments fall is not however a new phenomenon.  It has been proved more than once, not only in autocratic systems, which are always overturned by palace conspiracies, but also in governments perfectly instructed in the state of public opinion by the press and their own agents.  Among these instantaneous downfalls one of the most striking was that which followed the Ordinances of Charles X.  This monarch was, as we know, overthrown in four days.  His minister Polignac had taken no measures of defence, and the king was so confident of the tranquillity of Paris that he had gone hunting. The army was not in the least hostile, as in the reign of Louis XVI., but the troops, badly officered, disbanded before the attacks of a few insurgents.  The overthrow of Louis-Philippe was still more typical, since it did not result from any arbitrary action on the part of the sovereign.  This monarch was not surrounded by the hatred which finally surrounded Charles X., and his fall was the result of an insignificant riot which could easily have been repressed.  Historians, who can hardly comprehend how a solidly constituted government, supported by an imposing army, can be overthrown by a few rioters, naturally attributed the fall of Louis-Philippe to deep-seated causes.  In reality the incapacity of the generals entrusted with his defence was the real cause of his fall.  This case is one of the most instructive that could be cited, and is worthy of a moment's consideration.  It has been perfectly investigated by General Bonnal, in the light of the notes of an eye-witness, General Elchingen.  Thirty-six thousand troops were then in Paris, but the weakness and incapacity of their officers made it impossible to use them.  Contradictory orders were given, and finally the troops were forbidden to fire on the people, who, moreover--and nothing could have been more dangerous--were permitted to mingle with the troops.  The riot succeeded without fighting and forced the king to abdicate.  Applying to the preceding case our knowledge of the psychology of crowds, General Bonnal shows how easily the riot which overthrew Louis-Philippe could have been controlled.  He proves, notably, that if the commanding officers had not completely lost their heads quite a small body of troops could have prevented the insurgents from invading the Chamber of Deputies.  This last, composed of monarchists, would certainly have proclaimed the Count of Paris under the regency of his mother.  Similar phenomena were observable in the revolutions of Spain and Portugal.  These facts show the role of petty accessory circumstances in great events, and prove that one must not speak too readily of the general laws of history.  Without the riot which overthrew Louis-Philippe, we should probably have seen neither the Republic of 1848, nor the Second Empire, nor Sedan, nor the invasion, nor the loss of Alsace.  In the revolutions of which I have just been speaking the army was of no assistance to the government, but did not turn against it.  It sometimes happens otherwise.  It is often the army which effects the revolution, as in Turkey and Portugal.  The innumerable revolutions of the Latin republics of America are effected by the army.  When a revolution is effected by an army the new rulers naturally fall under its domination.  I have already recalled the fact that this was the case at the end of the Roman Empire, when the emperors were made and unmade by the soldiery.  The same thing has sometimes been witnessed in modern times.  The following extract from a newspaper, with reference to the Greek revolution, shows what becomes of a government dominated by its army:--  ``One day it was announced that eighty officers of the navy would send in their resignations if the government did not dismiss the leaders of whom they complained.  Another time it was the agricultural labourers on a farm (metairie) belonging to the Crown Prince who demanded the partition of the soil among them. The navy protested against the promotion promised to Colonel Zorbas.  Colonel Zorbas, after a week of discussion with Lieutenant Typaldos, treated with the President of the Council as one power with another.  During this time the Federation of the corporations abused the officers of the navy.  A deputy demanded that these officers and their families should be treated as brigands.  When Commander Miaoulis fired on the rebels, the sailors, who first of all had obeyed Typaldos, returned to duty. This is no longer the harmonious Greece of Pericles and Themistocles.  It is a hideous camp of Agramant.''  A revolution cannot be effected without the assistance or at least the neutrality of the army, but it often happens that the movement commences without it.  This was the case with the revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and that of 1870, which overthrew the Empire after the humiliation of France by the surrender of Sedan.  The majority of revolutions take place in the capitals, and by means of contagion spread through the country; but this is not a constant rule.  We know that during the French Revolution La Vendee, Brittany, and the Midi revolted spontaneously against Paris.   2.  How the resistance of Governments may overcome Revolution.   In the greater number of the revolutions enumerated above, we have seen governments perish by their weakness.  As soon as they were touched they fell.  The Russian Revolution proved that a government which defends itself energetically may finally triumph.  Never was revolution more menacing to the government.  After the disasters suffered in the Orient, and the severities of a too oppressive autocratic regime, all classes of society, including a portion of the army and the fleet, had revolted.  The railways, posts, and telegraph services had struck, so that communications between the various portions of the vast empire were interrupted.  The rural class itself, forming the majority of the nation, began to feel the influence of the revolutionary propaganda.  The lot of the peasants was wretched.  They were obliged, by the system of the mir, to cultivate soil which they could not acquire.  The government resolved immediately to conciliate this large class of peasants by turning them into proprietors.  Special laws forced the landlords to sell the peasants a portion of their lands, and banks intended to lend the buyers the necessary purchase-money were created.  The sums lent were to be repaid by small annuities deducted from the product of the sale of the crops.  Assured of the neutrality of the peasants, the government could contend with the fanatics who were burning the towns, throwing bombs among the crowds, and waging a merciless warfare.  All those who could be taken were killed.  Such extermination is the only method discovered since the beginning of the world by which a society can be protected against the rebels who wish to destroy it.  The victorious government understood moreover the necessity of satisfying the legitimate claims of the enlightened portion of the nation.  It created a parliament instructed to prepare laws and control expenditure.  The history of the Russian Revolution shows us how a government, all of whose natural supports have crumbled in succession, can, with wisdom and firmness, triumph over the most formidable obstacles.  It has been very justly said that governments are not overthrown, but that they commit suicide.   3.  Revolutions effected by Governments.--Examples: China, Turkey, &c.   Governments almost invariably fight revolutions; they hardly ever create them.  Representing the needs of the moment and general opinion, they follow the reformers timidly; they do not precede them.  Sometimes, however, certain governments have attempted those sudden reforms which we know as revolutions.  The stability or instability of the national "]]]
