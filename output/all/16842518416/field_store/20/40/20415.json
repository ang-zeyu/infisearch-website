Nourished by peaceful suns and gracious dew,   Your sweet youth budded and your sweet lives grew,   And all the world seemed rose-beset for you.    The rose of beauty was your mutual dower,   The stainless rose of love, an early flower,   The stately blooms of ease and wealth and power.    And treading thus on pathways flower-bestrewn,   It well might be, that, cold and careless grown,   You both had lived for your own joys alone.    But, holding all these fair things as in trust.   Gently you walked, still scattering on the dust   Of harder roads, which others tread, and must,--    Your heritage of brightness, not a ray   Of noontide sought you out, but straight away   You caught and halved it with some darker day:    And as the sweet saint's loaves were turned, it is said,   To roses, so your roses turned to bread,   That hungering souls and weary might be fed.    Dear friends, my poor words do but paint you wrong,   Nor can I utter, in one trivial song,   The goodness I have honored for so long.    Only this leaf, a single petal flung,   One chord from a full harmony unsung,   May speak the life-long love that lacks a tongue.       CONTENTS.     To J. H. and E. W. H.

Poems are heavenly things,   And only souls with wings   May reach them where they grow,   May pluck and bear below,   Feeding the nations thus   With food all glorious.    Verses are not of these;   They bloom on earthly trees,   Poised on a low-hung stem,   And those may gather them   Who cannot fly to where   The heavenly gardens are.    So I by devious ways   Have pulled some easy sprays   From the down-dropping bough   Which all may reach, and now   I knot them, bud and leaf,   Into a rhymed sheaf.    Not mine the pinion strong   To win the nobler song;   I only cull and bring   A hedge-row offering   Of berry, flower, and brake,   If haply some may take.       VERSES.       COMMISSIONED.  \"Do their errands; enter into the sacrifice with them; be a link yourself in the divine chain, and feel the joy and life of it.\"--ADELINE D. T. WHITNEY     What can I do for thee, Beloved,     Whose feet so little while ago     Trod the same way-side dust with mine,   And now up paths I do not know     Speed, without sound or sign?    What can I do? The perfect life     All fresh and fair and beautiful     Has opened its wide arms to thee;   Thy cup is over-brimmed and full;     Nothing remains for me.    I used to do so many things,--     Love thee and chide thee and caress;     Brush little straws from off thy way,   Tempering with my poor tenderness     The heat of thy short day.    Not much, but very sweet to give;     And it is grief of griefs to bear     That all these ministries are o'er,   And thou, so happy, Love, elsewhere,     Never can need me more:--    And I can do for thee but this     (Working on blindly, knowing not     If I may give thee pleasure so):   Out of my own dull, burdened lot     I can arise, and go    To sadder lives and darker homes,     A messenger, dear heart, from thee     Who wast on earth a comforter,   And say to those who welcome me,     I am sent forth by her.    Feeling the while how good it is     To do thy errands thus, and think     It may be, in the blue, far space,   Thou watchest from the heaven's brink,--     A smile upon my face.    And when the day's work ends with day,     And star-eyed evening, stealing in,     Waves a cool hand to flying noon,   And restless, surging thoughts begin,     Like sad bells out of tune,    I'll pray: \"Dear Lord, to whose great love     Nor bound nor limit line is set,     Give to my darling, I implore,   Some new sweet joy not tasted yet,     For I can give no more.\"    And with the words my thoughts shall climb     With following feet the heavenly stair     Up which thy steps so lately sped,   And, seeing thee so happy there,     Come back half comforted.     THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.    A little, rudely sculptured bed,     With shadowing folds of marble lace,   And quilt of marble, primly spread     And folded round a baby's face.    Smoothly the mimic coverlet,     With royal blazonries bedight,   Hangs, as by tender fingers set     And straightened for the last good-night.    And traced upon the pillowing stone     A dent is seen, as if to bless   The quiet sleep some grieving one     Had leaned, and left a soft impress.    It seems no more than yesterday     Since the sad mother down the stair   And down the long aisle stole away,     And left her darling sleeping there.    But dust upon the cradle lies,     And those who prized the baby so,   And laid her down to rest with sighs,     Were turned to dust long years ago.    Above the peaceful pillowed head     Three centuries brood, and strangers peep   And wonder at the carven bed,--     But not unwept the baby's sleep,    For wistful mother-eyes are blurred     With sudden mists, as lingerers stay,   And the old dusts are roused and stirred     By the warm tear-drops of to-day.    Soft, furtive hands caress the stone,     And hearts, o'erleaping place and age,   Melt into memories, and own     A thrill of common parentage.    Men die, but sorrow never dies;     The crowding years divide in vain,   And the wide world is knit with ties     Of common brotherhood in pain;    Of common share in grief and loss,     And heritage in the immortal bloom   Of Love, which, flowering round its cross,     Made beautiful a baby's tomb.     \"OF SUCH AS I HAVE.\"    Love me for what I am, Love. Not for sake   Of some imagined thing which I might be,   Some brightness or some goodness not in me,   Born of your hope, as dawn to eyes that wake   Imagined morns before the morning break.   If I, to please you (whom I fain would please),   Reset myself like new key to old tune,   Chained thought, remodelled action, very soon   My hand would slip from yours, and by degrees   The loving, faulty friend, so close to-day,   Would vanish, and another take her place,--   A stranger with a stranger's scrutinies,   A new regard, an unfamiliar face.   Love me for what I am, then, if you may;   But, if you cannot,--love me either way.     A  PORTRAIT.    All sweet and various things do lend themselves     And blend and intermix in her rare soul,   As chorded notes, which were untuneful else,     Clasp each the other in a perfect whole.    Within her spirit, dawn, all dewy-pearled,     Seems held and folded in by golden noons,   While past the sunshine gleams a further world     Of deep star-spaces and mysterious moons.    Like widths of blowing ocean wet with spray,     Like breath of early blooms at morning caught,   Like cool airs on the cheek of heated day,     Come the fair emanations of her thought.    Her movement, like the curving of a vine,     Seems an unerring accident of grace,   And like a flower's the subtle change and shine     And meaning of her brightly tranquil face.    And like a tree, unconscious of her shade,     She spreads her helpful branches everywhere   For wandering bird or bee, nor is afraid     Too many guests shall crowd to harbor there.    For she is kinder than all others are,     And weak things, sad things, gather where she dwells,   To reach and taste her strength and drink of her,     As thirsty creatures of clear water-wells.    Why vex with words where words are poor and vain?     In one brief sentence lies the riddle's key,   Which those who love her read and read again,     Finding each time new meanings: SHE IS SHE!     WHEN?    If I were told that I must die to-morrow,              That the next sun   Which sinks should bear me past all fear and sorrow              For any one,   All the fight fought, all the short journey through:              What should I do?    I do not think that I should shrink or falter,              But just go on,   Doing my work, nor change, nor seek to alter              Aught that is gone;   But rise and move and love and smile and pray              For one more day.    And, lying down at night for a last sleeping,              Say in that ear   Which hearkens ever: \"Lord, within Thy keeping              How should I fear?   And when to-morrow brings Thee nearer still.              Do Thou Thy will.\"    I might not sleep for awe; but peaceful, tender,              My soul would lie   All the night long; and when the morning splendor              Flashed o'er the sky,   I think that I could smile--could calmly say,              \"It is His day.\"    But, if instead a hand from the blue yonder              Held out a scroll,   On which my life was, writ, and I with wonder              Beheld unroll   To a long century's end its mystic clew,              What should I do?    What COULD I do, O blessed Guide and Master,              Other than this:   Still to go on as now, not slower, faster,              Nor fear to miss   The road, although so very long it be,              While led by Thee?    Step after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4560"],["title","Verses (#1)"],["body","tep, feeling Thee close beside me,              Although unseen,   Through thorns, through flowers, whether the tempest hide Thee,               Or heavens serene,   Assured Thy faithfulness cannot betray,              Thy love decay.    I may not know, my God; no hand revealeth              Thy counsels wise;   Along the path a deepening shadow stealeth,              No voice replies   To all my questioning thought, the time to tell,              And it is well.    Let me keep on, abiding and unfearing                Thy will always,   Through a long century's ripening fruition,                Or a short day's.   Thou canst not come too soon; and I can wait              If thou come late.     ON THE SHORE.      The punctual tide draws up the bay,     With ripple of wave and hiss of spray,   And the great red flower of the light-house tower     Blooms on the headland far away.      Petal by petal its fiery rose     Out of the darkness buds and grows;   A dazzling shape on the dim, far cape,     A beckoning shape as it comes and goes.      A moment of bloom, and then it dies     On the windy cliff 'twixt the sea and skies.   The fog laughs low to see it go,     And the white waves watch it with cruel eyes.      Then suddenly out of the mist-cloud dun,     As touched and wooed by unseen sun,   Again into sight bursts the rose of light     And opens its petals one by one.      Ah, the storm may be wild and the sea be strong,     And man is weak and the darkness long,   But while blossoms the flower on the light-house tower     There still is place for a smile and a song.     AMONG THE LILIES.      She stood among the lilies       In sunset's brightest ray,     Among the tall June lilies,       As stately fair as they;   And I, a boyish lover then,   Looked once, and, lingering, looked again,      And life began that day.      She sat among the lilies,       My sweet, all lily-pale;     The summer lilies listened,       I whispered low my tale.   O golden anthers, breathing balm,   O hush of peace, O twilight calm,       Did you or I prevail?      She lies among the lily-snows,       Beneath the wintry sky;     All round her and about her       The buried lilies lie.   They will awake at touch of Spring,   And she, my fair and flower-like thing,       In spring-time--by and by.     NOVEMBER.        Dry leaves upon the wall,   Which flap like rustling wings and seek escape,   A single frosted cluster on the grape       Still hangs--and that is all.        It hangs forgotten quite,--   Forgotten in the purple vintage-day,   Left for the sharp and cruel frosts to slay,       The daggers of the night.        It knew the thrill of spring;   It had its blossom-time, its perfumed noons;   Its pale-green spheres were rounded to soft runes       Of summer's whispering.        Through balmy morns of May;   Through fragrances of June and bright July,   And August, hot and still, it hung on high       And purpled day by day.        Of fair and mantling shapes,   No braver, fairer cluster on the tree;   And what then is this thing has come to thee       Among the other grapes,        Thou lonely tenant of the leafless vine,   Granted the right to grow thy mates beside,   To ripen thy sweet juices, but denied       Thy place among the wine?        Ah! we are dull and blind.   The riddle is too hard for us to guess   The why of joy or of unhappiness,       Chosen or left behind.        But everywhere a host   Of lonely lives shall read their type in thine:   Grapes which may never swell the tale of wine,       Left out to meet the frost.     EMBALMED.    This is the street and the dwelling,     Let me count the houses o'er;   Yes,--one, two, three from the corner,     And the house that I love makes four.    That is the very window     Where I used to see her head   Bent over book or needle,     With ivy garlanded.    And the very loop of the curtain,     And the very curve of the vine,   Were full of the grace and the meaning     Which was hers by some right divine.    I began to be glad at the corner,     And all the way to the door   My heart outran my footsteps,     And frolicked and danced before,    In haste for the words of welcome,     The voice, the repose and grace,   And the smile, like a benediction,     Of that beautiful, vanished face.    Now I pass the door, and I pause not,     And I look the other way;   But ever, a waft of fragrance,     Too subtle to name or stay,    Comes the thought of the gracious presence     Which made that past time sweet,   And still to those who remember,     Embalms the house and the street,    Like the breath from some vase, now empty     Of a flowery shape unseen,   Which follows the path of its lover,     To tell where a rose has been.     GINEVRA DEGLI AMIERI.  A STORY OF OLD FLORENCE.    So it is come! The doctor's glossy smile   Deceives me not. I saw him shake his head,   Whispering, and heard poor Giulia sob without,   As, slowly creaking, he went down the stair.   Were they afraid that I should be afraid?   I, who had died once and been laid in tomb?   They need not.                    Little one, look not so pale.   I am not raving. Ah! you never heard   The story. Climb up there upon the bed:   Sit close, and listen. After this one day   I shall not tell you stories any more.    How old are you, my rose? What! almost twelve?   Almost a woman? Scarcely more than that   Was your fair mother when she bore her bud;   And scarcely more was I when, long years since,   I left my father's house, a bride in May.   You know the house, beside St. Andrea's church,   Gloomy and rich, which stands, and seems to frown   On the Mercato, humming at its base;   And hold on high, out of the common reach,   The lilies and carved shields above its door;   And, higher yet, to catch and woo the sun,   A little loggia set against the sky?   That was my play-place ever as a child;   And with me used to play a kinsman's son,   Antonio Rondinelli. Ah, dear days!   Two happy things we were, with none to chide   Or hint that life was anything but play.    Sudden the play-time ended. All at once   \"You must be wed,\" they told me. \"What is wed?\"   I asked; but with the word I bent my brow,   Let them put on the garland, smiled to see   The glancing jewels tied about my neck;   And so, half-pleased, half-puzzled, was led forth   By my grave husband, older than my sire.    O the long years that followed! It would seem   That the sun never shone in all those years,   Or only with a sudden, troubled glint   Flashed on Antonio's curls, as he went by   Doffing his cap, with eyes of wistful love   Raised to my face,--my conscious, woful face.   Were we so much to blame? Our lives had twined   Together, none forbidding, for so long.   They let our childish fingers drop the seed,   Unhindered, which should ripen to tall grain;   They let the firm, small roots tangle and grow,   Then rent them, careless that it hurt the plant.   I loved Antonio, and he loved me.    Life was all shadow, but it was not sin!   I loved Antonio, but I kept me pure,   Not for my husband's sake, but for the sake   Of him, my first-born child, my little child,   Mine for a few short weeks, whose touch, whose look   Thrilled all my soul and thrills it to this day.   I loved; but, hear me swear, I kept me pure!   (Remember that, Madonna, when I come   Before thy throne to-morrow. Be not stern,   Or gaze upon me with reproachful look,   Making my little angel hide his face   And weep, while all the others turn glad eyes   Rejoicing on their mothers.)                                   It was hard   To sit in darkness while the rest had light,   To move to discords when the rest had song,   To be so young and never to have lived.   I bore, as women bear, until one day   Soul said to flesh, \"This I endure no more,\"   And with the word uprose, tore clay apart,   And what was blank before grew blanker still.    It was a fever, so the leeches said.   I had been dead so long, I did not know   The difference, or heed. Oil on my breast,   The garments of the grave about me wrapped,   They bore me forth, and laid me in the tomb.   The rich and beautiful and dreadful tomb,   Where all the buried Amteris lie,   Beneath the Duomo's black and towering shade.    Open the curtain, child. Yes, it is night.   It was night then, when I awoke to feel   That deadly chill, and see by ghostly gleams   Of moonlight, creeping through the grated door,   The coffins of my fathers all about.   Strange, hollow clamors rang and echoed back,   As, struggling out of mine, I dropped and fell.   With frantic strength I beat upon the grate.   It yielded to my touch. Some careless hand   Had left the bolt half-slipped. My father swore   Afterward, with a curse, he would make sure   Next time. NEXT TIME. That hurts me even now!    Dead or alive I issued, scarce sure which.   High overhead Giotto's tower soared;   Behind, the Duomo rose all white and black;   Then pealed a sudden jargoning of bells,   And down the darkling street I wildly fled,   Led by a little, cold, and wandering moon,   Which seemed as lonely and as lost as I.   I had no aim, save to reach warmth and light   And human touch; but still my witless steps   Led to my husband's door, and there I stopped,   By instinct, knocked, and called.                                        A window oped.   A voice--t'was his--demanded: \"Who is there?\"   \"Tis I, Ginevra.\" Then I heard the tone   Change into horror, and he prayed aloud   And called upon the saints, the while I urged,   \"O, let me in, Francesco; let me in!   I am so cold, so frightened, let me in!\"   Then, with a crash, the window was shut fast;   And, though I cried and beat upon the door   And wailed aloud, no other answer came.    Weeping, I turned away, and feebly strove   Down the hard distance towards my father's house.   \"They will have pity and will let me in,\"   I thought. \"They loved me and will let me in.\"   Cowards! At the high window overhead"]]]
