One end of the rope was still tied to the handle of the basket, and the other end to his swing seat, which lay on the ground before them.  \"Well,\" said he, \"let's go home. We've seen enough of this Blue Country and its Blue Boolooroo, I guess, an' it's a long journey back again.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Trot, jumping up.  Button-Bright stood on the bench and held up the Magic Umbrella, so he could open it, and the sailor had just attached the ropes when a thin blue line shot out from behind them and in a twinkling wound itself around the umbrella. At the same instant another blue cord wound itself around the boy's body, and others caught Trot and Cap'n Bill in their coils, so that all had their arms pinned fast to their sides and found themselves absolutely helpless.     THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES  CHAPTER 6   The Boolooroo was laughing and dancing around in front of them as if well pleased. For a moment the prisoners could not imagine what had happened to them, but presently half a dozen Blueskins, resembling in shape and costume their ruler but less magnificently dressed, stepped in front of them and bowed low to the Boolooroo.  \"Your orders, most Mighty, Flighty, Tight and Righty Monarch, have been obeyed,\" said the leader.  \"Very well, Captain. Take that umbrella and carry it to my Royal Treasury. See that it is safely locked up. Here's the key, and if you don't return it to me within five minutes, I'll have you patched.\"  The Captain took the key and the Magic Umbrella and hastened away to the palace. Button-Bright had already hooked the ropes to the elephant-trunk handle, so that when the Captain carried away the umbrella, he dragged after him first the double seat, then Cap'n Bill's seat, which was fastened to it, and finally the lunch-basket, which was attached to the lower seat. At every few steps some of these would trip up the Captain and cause him to take a tumble, but as he had only five minutes' time in which to perform his errand, he would scramble to his feet again and dash along the path until a board or the basket tripped him up again.  They all watched him with interest until he had disappeared within the palace, when the King turned to his men and said:  \"Release the prisoners. They are now quite safe, and cannot escape me.\"  So the men unwound the long cords that were twined around the bodies of our three friends, and set them free. These men seemed to be soldiers, although they bore no arms except the cords. Each cord had a weight at the end, and when the weight was skillfully thrown by a soldier, it wound the cord around anything in the twinkling of an eye and held fast until it was unwound again.  Trot decided these Blueskins must have stolen into the garden when summoned by the bells the Boolooroo had rung, but they had kept out of sight and crept up behind the bench on which our friends were seated until a signal from the king aroused them to action.  The little girl was greatly surprised by the suddenness of her capture, and so was Button-Bright. Cap'n Bill shook his head and said he was afeared they'd get into trouble. \"Our mistake,\" he added, \"was in stoppin' to eat our lunch. But it's too late now to cry over spilt milk.\"  \"I don't mind, not much anyhow,\" asserted Trot bravely. \"We're in no hurry to get back, are we, Button-Bright?\"  \"I'm not,\" said the boy. \"If they hadn't taken the umbrella, I wouldn't care how long we stopped in this funny island. Do you think it's a fairy country, Trot?\"  \"Can't say, I'm sure,\" she answered. \"I haven't seen anything here yet that reminds me of fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a floating island in the sky was sure to be a fairyland.\"  \"I think so yet, mate,\" returned the sailor. \"But there's all sorts o' fairies, I've heard. Some is good, an' some is bad, an' if all the Blueskins are like their Boolooroo, they can't be called fust-class.\"  \"Don't let me hear any more impudence, prisoners!\" called the Boolooroo sternly. \"You are already condemned to severe punishment, and if I have any further trouble with you, you are liable to be patched.\"  \"What's being patched?\" inquired the girl.  The soldiers all laughed at this question, but the King did not reply. Just then a door in the palace opened and out trooped a group of girls. There were six of them, all gorgeously dressed in silken gowns with many puffs and tucks and ruffles and flounces and laces and ribbons, everything being in some shade of blue, grading from light blue to deep blue. Their blue hair was elaborately dressed and came to a point at the top of their heads. The girls approached in a line along the garden path, all walking with mincing steps and holding their chins high. Their skirts prevented their long legs from appearing as grotesque as did those of the men, but their necks were so thin and long that the ruffles around them only made them seem the more absurd.  \"Ah,\" said the King with a frown, \"here come the Six Snubnosed Princesses, the most beautiful and aristocratic ladies in Sky Island.\"  \"They're snubnosed, all right,\" observed Trot, looking at the girls with much interest, \"but I should think it would make 'em mad to call 'em that.\"  \"Why?\" asked the Boolooroo in surprise. \"Is not a snub nose the highest mark of female beauty?\"  \"Is it?\" asked the girl.  \"Most certainly. In this favored island, which is the Center of the Universe, a snub nose is an evidence of high breeding which any lady would be proud to possess.\"  The Six Snubnosed Princesses now approached the fountain and stood in a row, staring with haughty looks at the strangers.  \"Goodness me, your Majesty!\" exclaimed the first. \"What queer, dreadful-looking creatures are these? Where in all the Sky did they come from?\"  \"They say they came from the Earth, Cerulia,\" answered the Boolooroo.  \"But that is impossible,\" said another Princess. \"Our scientists have proved that the Earth is not inhabited.\"  \"Your scientists'll have to guess again, then,\" said Trot.  \"But how did they get to Sky Island?\" inquired the third snubnosed one.  \"By means of a Magic Umbrella, which I have captured and put away in my Treasure Chamber,\" replied the Boolooroo.  \"What will you do with the monsters, papa?\" asked the fourth Princess.  \"I haven't decided yet,\" said the Boolooroo. \"They're curiosities, you see, and may serve to amuse us. But as they're only half civilized, I shall make them my slaves.\"  \"What are they good for? Can they do anything useful?\" asked the fifth.  \"We'll see,\" returned the King impatiently. \"I can't decide in a hurry. Give me time, Azure, give me time. If there's anything I hate, it's a hurry.\"  \"I've an idea, your Majesty,\" announced the sixth Snubnosed Princess, whose complexion was rather darker than that of her sisters, \"and it has come to me quite deliberately, without any hurry at all. Let us take the little girl to be our maid--to wait upon us and amuse us when we're dull. All the other ladies of the court will be wild with envy, and if the child doesn't prove of use to us, we can keep her for a living pincushion.\"  \"Oh! Ah! That will be fine!\" cried all the other five, and the Boolooroo said:  \"Very well, Indigo, it shall be as you desire.\" Then he turned to Trot and added, \"I present you to the Six Lovely Snubnosed Princesses, to be their slave. If you are good and obedient, you won't get your ears boxed oftener than once an hour.\"  \"I won't be anybody's slave,\" protested Trot. \"I don't like these snubnosed, fussy females, an' I won't have anything to do with 'em.\"  \"How impudent!\" cried Cerulia.  \"How vulgar!\" cried Turquoise.  \"How unladylike!\" cried Sapphire.  \"How silly!\" cried Azure.  \"How absurd!\" cried Cobalt.  \"How wicked!\" cried Indigo. And then all six held up their hands as if horrified.  The Boolooroo laughed. \"You'll know how to bring her to time, I imagine,\" he remarked, \"and if the girl isn't reasonable and obedient, send her to me and I'll have her patched. Now, then, take her away.\"  But Trot was obstinate and wouldn't budge a step. \"Keep us together, your Majesty,\" begged Cap'n Bill. \"If we're to be slaves, don't separate us, but make us all the same kind o' slaves.\"  \"I shall do what pleases me,\" declared the Boolooroo angrily. \"Don't try to dictate, old Moonface, for there's only one Royal Will in Sky Island, and that's my own.\"  He then gave a command to a soldier, who hastened away to the palace and soon returned with a number of long, blue ribbons. One he tied around Trot's waist and then attached to it six other ribbons. Each of the Six Snubnosed Princesses held the end of a ribbon, and then they turned and marched haughtily away to the palace, dragging the little girl after them.  \"Don't worry, Trot,\" cried Button-Bright. \"We'll get you out of this trouble pretty soon.\"  \"Trust to us, mate,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"We'll manage to take care o' you.\"  \"Oh, I'm all right,\" answered Trot with fine courage. \"I'm not afraid of these gawkies.\"  But the princesses pulled her after them, and soon they had all disappeared into one of the entrances to the Blue Palace.  \"Now, then,\" said the Boolooroo. \"I will instruct you two in your future duties. I shall make old Moonface--\"  \"My name's Cap'n Bill Weedles,\" interrupted the sailor.  \"I don't care what your name is. I shall call you old Moonface,\" replied the king, \"for that suits you quite well. I shall appoint you the Royal Nectar Mixer to the court of Sky Island, and if you don't mix our nectar properly, I'll have you patched.\"  \"How do you mix it?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"I don't mix it. It's not the Boolooroo's place to mix nectar,\" was the stern reply. \"But you may inquire of the palace servants, and perhaps the Royal Chef or the Major-domo will condescend to tell you. Take him to the servants' quarters, Captain Ultramarine, and give him a suit of the royal livery.\"  So Cap'n"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4356"],["title","Sky Island (#7)"],["body","was lad away by the chief of the soldiers, and when he had gone, the king said to Button-Bright, \"You, slave, shall be the Royal Bootblue. Your duty will be to keep the boots and shoes of the royal family nicely polished with blue.\"  \"I don't know how,\" answered Button-Bright surlily.  \"You'll soon learn. The Royal Steward will supply you with blue paste, and when you've brushed this on our shoes, you must shine them with Q-rays of Moonshine. Do you understand?\"  \"No,\" said Button-Bright.  Then the Boolooroo told one of the soldiers to take the boy to the shoeblue den and have him instructed in his duties, and the soldiers promptly obeyed and dragged Button-Bright away to the end of the palace where the servants lived.     GHIP-GHISIZZLE PROVES FRIENDLY  CHAPTER 7   The Royal Palace was certainly a magnificent building, with large and lofty rooms and superb furnishings, all being in shades of blue. The soldier and the boy passed through several broad corridors and then came to a big hall where many servants were congregated. These were staring in bewilderment at Cap'n Bill, who had been introduced to them by Captain Ultramarine. Now they turned in no less surprise to examine the boy, and their looks expressed not only astonishment but dislike.  The servants were all richly attired in blue silk liveries, and they seemed disposed to resent the fact that these strangers had been added to their ranks. They scowled and muttered and behaved in a very unfriendly way, even after Captain Ultramarine had explained that the newcomers were merely base slaves, and not to be classed with the free royal servants of the palace.  One of those present, however, showed no especial enmity to Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill, and this Blueskin attracted the boy's notice because his appearance was so strange. He looked as if he were made of two separate men, each cut through the middle and then joined together, half of one to half of the other. One side of his blue hair was curly and the other half straight; one ear was big and stuck out from the side of his head, while the other ear was small and flat; one eye was half shut and twinkling, while the other was big and staring; his nose was thin on one side and flat on the other, while one side of his mouth curled up and the other down. Button-Bright also noticed that he limped as he walked because one leg was a trifle longer than the other, and that one hand was delicate and slender and the other thick and hardened by use.  \"Don't stare at him,\" a voice whispered in the boy's ear. \"The poor fellow has been patched, that's all.\"  Button-Bright turned to see who had spoken and found by his side a tall young Blueskin with a blue-gold chain around his neck. He was quite the best looking person the boy had seen in Sky Island, and he spoke in a pleasant way and seemed quite friendly. But the two-sided man had overheard the remark, and he now stepped forward and said in a careless tone:  \"Never mind. It's no disgrace to be patched in a country ruled by such a cruel Boolooroo as we have. Let the boy look at me if he wants to. I'm not pretty, but that's not my fault. Blame the Boolooroo.\"  \"I--I'm glad to meet you, sir,\" stammered Button-Bright. \"What is your name, please?\"  \"I'm now named Jimfred Jonesjinks, and my partner is called Fredjim Jinksjones. He's busy at present guarding the Treasure Chamber, but I'll introduce you to him when he comes back. We've had the misfortune to be patched, you know.\"  \"What is being patched?\" asked the boy.  \"They cut two of us in halves and mismatch the halves--half of one to half of the other, you know--and then the other two halves are patched together. It destroys our individuality and makes us complex creatures, so it's the worst punishment than can be inflicted in Sky Island.\"  \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, alarmed at such dreadful butchery. \"Doesn't it hurt?\"  \"No, it doesn't hurt,\" replied Jimfred. \"But it makes one frightfully nervous. They stand you under a big knife, which drops and slices you neatly in two, exactly in the middle. Then they match half of you to another person who has likewise been sliced, and there you are, patched to someone you don't care about and haven't much interest in. If your half wants to do something, the other half is likely to want to do something different, and the funny part of it is you don't quite know which is your half and which is the other half. It's a terrible punishment, and in a country where one can't die or be killed until he has lived his six hundred years, to be patched is a great misfortune.\"  \"I'm sure it is,\" said Button-Bright earnestly. \"But can't you ever get--get--UNpatched again?\"  \"If the Boolooroo would consent, I think it could be done,\" Jimfred replied, \"but he never will consent. This is about the meanest Boolooroo who ever ruled this land, and he was the first to invent patching people as a punishment. I think we will all be glad when his three hundred years of rule are ended.\"  \"When will that be?\" inquired the boy.  \"Hush-sh-sh!\" cried everyone in a chorus, and they all looked over their shoulders as if frightened by the question. The officer with the blue-gold chain pulled Button-Bright's sleeve and whispered, \"Follow me, please.\" And then he beckoned to Cap'n Bill and led the two slaves to another room where they were alone.  \"I must instruct you in your duties,\" said he when they were all comfortably seated in cozy chairs with blue cushions. \"You must learn how to obey the Boolooroo's commands, so he won't become angry and have you patched.\"  \"How could he patch US?\" asked the sailorman curiously.  \"Oh, he'd just slice you all in halves and then patch half of the boy to half of the girl, and the other half to half of you, and the other half of you to the other half of the girl. See?\"  \"Can't say I do,\" said Cap'n Bill, much bewildered. \"It's a reg'lar mix-up.\"  \"That's what it's meant to be,\" explained the young officer.  \"An' seein' as we're Earth folks, an' not natives of Sky Island, I've an idea the slicing machine would about end us, without bein' patched,\" continued the sailor.  \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, \"so it would.\"  \"While you are in this country, you can't die till you've lived six hundred years,\" declared the officer.  \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"That's different, of course. But who are you, please?\"  \"My name is Ghip-Ghi-siz-zle. Can you remember it?\"  \"I can 'member the 'sizzle,'\" said the boy, \"but I'm 'fraid the Gwip--Grip--Glip--\"  \"Ghip-Ghi-siz-zle\" repeated the officer slowly. \"I want you to remember my name, because if you are going to live here, you are sure to hear of me a great many times. Can you keep a secret?\"  \"I can try,\" said Button-Bright.  \"I've kep' secrets--once in a while,\" asserted Cap'n Bill.  \"Well, try to keep this one. I'm to be the next Boolooroo of Sky Island.\"  \"Good for you!\" cried the sailor. \"I wish you was the Boolooroo now, sir. But it seems you've got to wait a hundred years or more afore you can take his place.\"  Ghip-Ghisizzle rose to his feet and paced up and down the room for a time, a frown upon his face. Then he halted and faced Cap'n Bill. \"Sir,\" said he, \"there lies all my trouble. I'm quite sure the present Boolooroo has reigned three hundred years next Thursday, but he claims it is only two hundred years, and as he holds the Royal Book of Records under lock and key in the Royal Treasury, there is no way for us to prove he is wrong.\"  \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"How old is the Boolooroo?\"  \"He was two hundred years old when he was elected,\" replied Ghip-Ghisizzle. \"If he has already reigned three hundred years as I suspect, then he is now five hundred years old. You see, he is trying to steal another hundred years of rule so as to remain a tyrant all his life.\"  \"He don't seem as old as that,\" observed Cap'n Bill thoughtfully. \"Why, I'm only sixty myself, an' I guess I look twice as old as your king does.\"  \"We do not show our age in looks,\" the officer answered. \"I am just about your age, sir--sixty-two my next birthday--but I'm sure I don't look as old as that.\"  \"That's a fact,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. Then he turned to Button-Bright and added, \"Don't that prove Sky Island is a fairy country as I said?\"  \"Oh, I've known that all along,\" said the boy. \"The slicing and patching proves it, and so do lots of other things.\"  \"Now then,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"let us talk over your duties. It seems you must mix the royal nectar, Cap'n Bill. Do you know how to do that?\"  \"I'm free to say as I don't, friend Sizzle.\"  \"The Boolooroo is very particular about his nectar. I think he has given you this job so he can find fault with you and have you punished. But we will fool him. You are strangers here, and I don't want you imposed upon. I'll send Tiggle to the royal pantry and keep him there to mix the nectar. Then when the Boolooroo or the Queen or any of the Snubnosed Princesses call for a drink, you can carry it to them and it will be sure to suit them.\"  \"Thank'e sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"That's real kind of you.\"  \"Your job, Button-Bright, is easier,\" continued Ghip-Ghisizzle.  \"I'm no bootblack,\" declared the boy. \"The Boolooroo has no right to make me do his dirty work.\"  \"You're a slave,\" the officer reminded him, \"and a slave must obey.\"  \"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.  \"Because he can't help himself. No slave ever wants to obey, but he just has to. And it isn't dirty work at all. You don't black the royal boots and shoes, you merely blue them with a finely perfumed blue paste. Then you shine them neatly and your task is done. You will not be humiliated by becoming a bootblack. You'll be a bootblue.\"  \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"I don't see much difference, but perhaps it's a little more respectable.\"  \"Yes, the Royal Bootblue is considered a high official in Sky Island. You do your work at evening or early morning, and the rest of the day you are at liberty to do as you please.\"  \"It won't last long, Button-Bright,\" said Cap'n Bill"]]]
