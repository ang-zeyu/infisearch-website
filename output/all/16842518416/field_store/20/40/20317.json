And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.\" Then he sought to impress upon the minds of the Saints the fact that the prophets before him had also predicted these direful events, saying: \"That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior; knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying: Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\"  The Mystery of Iniquity  As already stated, Paul declared to the Thessalonians that the \"mystery of iniquity\" was already at work, and to Timothy he said: \"All they which are in Asia be turned away from me.\" He had, we are led to believe, had some dispute with Asiatic converts, for he wrote to Timothy in great sorrow because some of his companions had forsaken him and were advocating doctrines contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. In trying to correct these evils he was left to contend alone, for he adds: \"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.\"  Decline of Spiritual Gifts  It was not long after the departure of the apostles that spiritual gifts ceased to be manifest in the Church. The decline of these blessings, which are inseparably connected with the Church of Christ, led to the belief, so prevalent even in this day, that they were not to be continued, having been instituted in the incipiency of the Church, merely as a means of aiding in its establishment, after which they were no longer needed.  Revelation and heavenly communication also came to an end. There was no more vision, for the people had closed their eyes. This condition also led to the universal belief, which the world holds even now, that the canon of scripture is full and there is to be no more scripture, notwithstanding the Lord has revealed through his servants that revelation is to continue.  Changes in Church Government  The offices in the Priesthood were also changed because those unto whom the Gospel was preached would not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears and were \"men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.\"  The Church Taken from Among Men  Instead of apostles and prophets there came, as time went on, a very different ecclesiastical order from that instituted by the Lord. The Church established by the Redeemer was taken from the earth because of continued persecution and apostasy, until there was but a dead form of the true Church left. The great ecclesiastical organization that arose and claimed to be the Church of Christ was of gradual growth. The change from truth to error was not made all in one day. It commenced in the first century and continued during the immediate centuries that followed, until the Church established in the days of the apostles was no more to be found among men. Without the direction of inspired men, who could communicate with God, the change was a natural one.  Rise of the Church of Rome  In the beginning of the fourth century this great religious power, under the Emperor Constantine became the state religion of the Roman Empire. From that time forth its dominion spread and before many years had passed away it became the ruling power in religion in the so-called civilized world. By it \"times and laws\" were changed. The simple principles of the Christian faith were embellished almost beyond recognition with pomp and mystic rites borrowed from pagan worship. The priests and potentates, who officiated in these ceremonies, no longer followed the simple customs of the humble fishermen of Galilee but, dressed in splendid and costly robes, with mitres on their heads, they performed their various parts in pride and with mystifying ceremonies that over-awed and bewildered the humble people.  Changes in the Doctrines of the Church  The correct doctrine regarding the Godhead taught by Jesus Christ, was changed into a mystery. The ordinance of baptism was changed from burial in the water for the remission of sins, to sprinkling of a little water on the head. Sprinkling of infants, miscalled baptism, a custom which \"is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit,\" became a fixed and universal custom. Changes in the administration of the sacrament of the Lord's supper were also introduced, and the doctrine advanced that the bread and wine became the flesh and blood of our crucified Redeemer, by transubstantiation. Those who entered the ministry were forbidden to marry, and many other changes, which need not be mentioned here, were made in the principles of the Gospel, in the functions of the Priesthood and the worship of the Lord.  Temporal Power of the Pope  Rome became the capital of this ecclesiastical power and the bishop or pope, as he was called, its head. As its power grew it claimed dominion not only in matter religious, but in civil affairs as well. During the acme of its glory it ruled practically the known world. By it kings were made and by it they were dethroned. Unless they bowed before the papal power in abject submission they were made to feel the weight of its mighty hand.  Frederick Seebohm, in his _Era of the Protestant Revolution_, says: \"Kings were not secure on their thrones till they had the sanction of the Church. On the other hand the clergy claimed to be free from prosecution under the criminal laws of the land they lived in. They struggled to keep their own ecclesiastical laws and their own ecclesiastical courts, receiving authority direct from Rome, and with final appeal, not to the crown, but to the pope.\"  \"To establish an accusation against a bishop,\" writes Motley, in his _Rise of the Dutch Republic_, \"seventy-two witnesses were necessary; against a deacon, twenty-seven; against an inferior dignitary, seven; while two were sufficient to convict a layman.\"  Power of the Clergy  Few outside of the clergy were educated enough to read and write; therefore priests became the lawyers, diplomats, ambassadors, instructors and prime ministers in the nations. All learned men talked and wrote in Latin, which was the language of Rome. It is said that for centuries a man convicted of a crime in England, by showing that he could read or write, could claim the benefits of a trial in the ecclesiastical court, which, \"by long abuse came to mean exemption from the punishment of the criminal law of the land.\"  Not only did the priests fill these important offices where they were enabled to wield great power and to control, very largely, the destinies of nations, but many of them became extremely avaricious and \"divined for money.\" Jean de Valdez, brother of the secretary to King Charles V, wrote of the times as follows: \"I see that we can scarcely get anything from Christ's ministers but for money; at baptism money, at bishoping money, at marriage money, for confession money--no, not extreme unction without money! They will ring no bells without money, no burial in Church without money; so that it seemeth that Paradise is shut up from them that have no money. The rich is buried in the Church, the poor in the church-yard. The rich may marry with his nearest kin, but the poor not so, albeit he be ready to die for love of her. The rich may eat flesh in Lent, but the poor may not, albeit fish perhaps be much dearer. The rich man may readily get large indulgences, but the poor none, because he wanteth money to pay for them\" (_Era of the Protestant Revolution_, p. 60).  In addition to all this they taxed the people in various ways, receiving a tithing from all produce of the farms, a tenth of the land and of the wages of the working man. Writes Motley: \"Not content, moreover, with their territories and their tithings, the churchmen perpetually devised new burdens upon the peasantry. Plows, sickles, horses, oxen, all implements of husbandry were taxed for the benefit of those who toiled not, but who gathered into barns.\"  Sale of Indulgences  Some of these ecclesiastical rulers became so avaricious and filled with the spirit of greed that they advanced the blasphemous doctrine of forgiving sins by the sale of indulgences. It is claimed by the Church of Rome that these evils were the sins of individuals who perverted the doctrine of the church in relation to penance and forgiveness of sin. The indulgence was, according to their teaching, \"a pardon usually granted by the pope, through which the contrite sinner escaped a part, or all, of the punishment which remained even after he had been absolved. The pardon did not therefore forgive the guilt of the sinner, for that had necessarily to be removed before the indulgence was granted; it only removed or mitigated the penalties which even the forgiven sinner would, without the indulgence, have expected to undergo in purgatory.\"[1]  However, the sale of indulgences in various parts of Europe, was a means of creating large fortunes for those who sanctioned it. There was no crime in the category for which the power of forgiveness was not offered if the party seeking it could pay the price. The various countries were districted and farmed for the collection of these revenues, according to John Lathrop Motley, the historian, who writes:      \"The price current of the wares offered for sale was published     in every"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45054"],["title","Essentials in Church History (#3)"],["body"," and village [in the Netherlands]. God's pardon for     crimes already committed, or about to be committed, was advertized     according to a graded tariff. Thus poisoning, for example, was     absolved for eleven ducats, six livres tournois. Absolution for     incest was afforded at thirty-six livres, three ducats. Perjury     came to seven livres and three carlines. Pardon for murder, if not     by poison, was cheaper. Even a parricide could buy forgiveness at     God's tribunal at one ducat, four livres, eight carlines. Henry de     Mountfort, in the year 1448, purchased absolution for that crime     at that price. Was it strange that a century or so of this kind of     work should produce a Luther? Was it unnatural that plain people,     who loved the ancient Church, should rather desire to see her     purged of such blasphemous abuses than to hear of St. Peter's dome     rising a little nearer to the clouds on these proceeds of commuted     crime? . . . The Netherlands, like other countries, are districted     and farmed for the collection of this papal revenue. Much of the     money thus raised remains in the hands of the vile collectors.     Sincere Catholics, who love and honor the ancient religion, shrink     with horror at the spectacle offered on every side. Criminals     buying paradise for money, monks spending the money thus paid in     gaming houses, taverns, and brothels; this seems to those who have     studied their Testaments a different scheme of salvation from the     one promulgated by Christ. There has evidently been a departure     from the system of earlier apostles. Innocent conservative souls     are much perplexed; but at last all these infamies arouse a giant     to do battle with the giant wrong.\"[2]  Thus were the prophecies of the scriptures fulfilled; the laws transgressed by a power that exalted itself \"above all that is called God\" and in his sacred name speaking \"great words against the Most High.\"  Notes  1. _History of Western Europe_, p. 39, James Harvey Robinson.  2. _The Rise of the Dutch Republic_, vol. 1, pp. 63-66, Motley.    Chapter 3  The Protestant Revolution  The \"Dark Ages\"  Not content with absolute dominion over the spiritual and temporal affairs of the people, this papal kingdom attempted the exercise of authority also over the consciences of men. Especially was this so during the dark ages, when this power was at the zenith of its glory. This exercise of authority extended also far into the day when the light of religious freedom commenced to break forth, during the period known as the revival of learning. Previous to this revival, as we have seen, the language of learning was the Latin tongue. The people were helplessly dependent upon their priests for all instruction in scientific as well as religious thought. The few copies of the Bible extant were guarded by the clergy, and the scriptures were not accessible to the common people, and since they could neither read nor write, and in very few instances understood Latin, they would have been helpless even with the Bible in their hands. Under these conditions it is not to be wondered at that the poor people of those benighted countries of Europe, credulous and filled with superstitious fear, were ready to accept almost anything that was made known to them, in doctrine or deed, by unscrupulous priests.  The Revival of Learning  Neither is it to be wondered at that priests attempted to use force and coercion during the revival of learning to check the opportunities of the people in obtaining light and truth. It was due to the exercise of greater knowledge on the part of the priests and their performance of mystic ceremonies, that over-awed the people and enabled the clergy to keep them shackled by the chains of ignorance and superstition. Ignorance was a ready tool in the hands of the priests by which they shaped and moulded the masses into vessels to their liking. The increase of learning among the people, aided by the discoveries and inventions of the times, would change all this; for the people would not be so ready to accept every wind of doctrine without some mental cogitation and desire to have a reason given why things were thus and so. Moreover, the revival of learning meant the end of many practices and blasphemous doctrines advanced in the name of Jesus Christ, such as the exercise of force over the consciences of men and the sale of indulgences for the pardon of sin--if not the end, at least a wonderful modification of such an evil system.  Early Translations of the Bible  Evidently this ruling ecclesiastical power realized that enlightened conditions would bring rebellion against its authority. For that reason stringent laws were framed to enforce the edicts and regulations of the church of Rome. During the \"Reformation\" and before, there were several translations of the Bible made in the languages which the common people understood. Wycliffe's Bible appeared in 1380 and was followed by translations at a later date, both in English and other tongues. At first there was an attempt to destroy these copies which were prepared without authority or sanction from the Catholic Church. With the invention of printing in the fifteenth century, however, the cause of religious freedom received a wonderful impetus, and Bibles were distributed all over Europe. Before the time of printing a Bible cost five hundred crowns, and such copies as were in existence were in the keeping of the clergy, who guarded them with the utmost zeal. Through the aid of printing, the price of Bibles was reduced to five crowns, which made it possible for the people not only to have the privilege of hearing the scriptures read in their own tongue, but also to acquire the understanding by which they could read them for themselves.  Scripture-Reading Forbidden  An English chronicler, Henry Kneighton, many years before the \"Reformation\" expressed the prevailing notion about the reading of the scriptures when he denounced the general reading of the Bible, lamenting \"lest the jewel of the Church, hitherto the exclusive property of the clergy and divines, should be made common to the laity.\" Archbishop Arundel in England had issued an enactment that \"no part of the scriptures in English should be read, either in public or in private, or be thereafter translated, under pain of the greater excommunication.\" The New Testament translation of Erasmus was forbidden at Cambridge, and the Vicar of Croyden said from his pulpit: \"We must root out printing, or printing will root us out.\" In the reign of Henry VIII the reading of the Bible by the common people, or those who were not of the privileged class, had been prohibited by act of Parliament, and men were burned at the stake in England as well as in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe for having even fragments of the scriptures in their hands.  For those who were considered derelict in church duties or heretical in doctrine, edicts were declared, forbidding them to gather in private assemblies for devotion, in various parts of Europe. All reading of the scriptures; all discussion within one's own doors concerning faith, the sacraments, the papal authority, or other religious matter, was forbidden \"under penalty of death. The edicts were no dead letter. The fires were kept constantly supplied with human fuel by monks who knew the act of burning reformers better than of arguing with them. The scaffold was the most conclusive of syllogisms, and used upon all occasions\" (_The Rise of the Dutch Republic_, Motley).  The Inquisition  Continuing this woeful account of conditions in the rebellious Netherlands and other countries under Spanish rule, the author of _The Rise of the Dutch Republic_ says: \"Charles V introduced and organized a papal institution, side by side with those horrible 'Placards' of his invention, which constituted a masked inquisition even more cruel than that of Spain. . . . The execution of the system was never permitted to languish. The number of Netherlanders who were burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive, in obedience to his edicts, and for the offense of reading the scriptures, of looking askance at a graven image, or of ridiculing the actual presence of the body and blood of Christ in a wafer, have been placed as high as one hundred thousand by distinguished authorities, and have never been put at a lower mark than fifty thousand.\"  Dawning of a Better Day  Conditions like these could not go on forever. The dawn of a better day began to break over the nations. The Spirit of the Lord was striving with men and preparations commenced for the introduction into the world of the re-established Gospel at a later day. It was necessary that the shackles of superstitious fear and illiteracy, which bound the world so completely, should be broken, that men might exercise their right of free agency before the fulness of Gospel light should break forth. Not only was advancement made in the art of printing, but there came a revival of learning and research in all directions and in all parts of Europe. It was not confined to one land or to one people, but the whole of Europe took on a new life. The discovery of the telescope, the law of gravitation, the invention of gunpowder and many other wonderful things, were revolutionizing the thoughts of men.  The Mission of Columbus  With the discovery of the mariner's compass navigators became more bold and daring, and gradually extended their explorations until they discovered the way to India around the Cape of Good Hope. Near the close of the fifteenth century the belief prevailed that the earth was flat and inhabited only on the upper side. Beyond the shores of lands then known it was thought there hung a pall of fog and darkness. The sea was referred to as the \"Sea of Darkness\" beyond the boundaries known to man. Far off in or beyond the ocean it was believed great dragons had their lair, and if any man should be so unfortunate as to "]]]
