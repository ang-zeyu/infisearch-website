Anyhow, his first condescension was all gone by noon, when they halted, a league short of the city, to rest and dine at the ’Angel and Tower,’ a prosperous inn of the suburbs set among mellowing vineyards.  Of all the company Bernardo was perhaps the only one unconscious of the threatening atmosphere.  Wonderful thoughts were kindling in him at the near prospect of this, the goal to all his hopes and ambitions.  Milan! It was Milan at last—the capital of his promised estate of love.  Blue and small, swimming far away in the sun mists of the plains, he felt that he could clasp it all in his arms, and carry it to the foot of the Throne.  His eyes brightened with clear tears: this salvage of the dark, dead ages reclaimed to God!  ’_Domine!_’ he exclaimed in ecstasy, clasping his hands: ’_Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam_!  O Lord, touch mine eyes, that they may penetrate even where Thy light shineth like a glow-worm in deep mosses!’  Carlo roughly shouted him to their meal.  His heart was throbbing with an emotional rapture as he obeyed. The table was served in a trellised alley, under hanging stalactites of grapes.  Beatrice flagged on a bench at the end of the board, her shoulders sunk into a bower all crushed of sunshine and green shadows.  It was the vine-goddess come home, soft, sensual, making a lust of fatigue.  Her lids were half-closed; her teeth showed in a small, indolent smile; light, reflected from the purple clusters, slept on the warm ivory of her skin.  Bernardo, coming opposite her, stood transfixed before a vision of such utter animal loveliness.  His breath seemed to mount quicker as he gazed.  Carlo drummed on the board, where he sat hunched over it.  Looking from one to the other, he puffed out a little ironic laugh.  ’Wonderest what is passing there, boy?’ said he. ’Wilt never know.  Not a hair would she turn though, like Althea, she were to find herself in child with a firebrand.’  Bernardo lowered his eyes with a blush.  ’Nay,’ said he, ’my thoughts of Madonna were more tempered.  I coveted only her beauty for heaven.’  ’Anon, Messer, anon!’ cried the other banteringly: ’be not so free with my property.  I hold her yet about the waist, seest, with a silver fetter?  If there be a prior claim to mine——’  ’Ay, Chastity’s,’ put in the boy.  Lanti hooted.  ’Tempt her, if thou wilt, with such a suitor.  She will follow him as she would the hangman.  Wilt throw off thy belt, Beatrice?  I gave a thousand scudi for it.  See what Chastity here will offer thee in its room.’  ’I will answer, if I may examine it,’ said Bembo gravely.  ’Will you tell her to unclasp it, Carlo, and let me look?  I see it is all hinged of antique coins.  There was a Father at San Zeno collected such things.’  ’What, ladies’ girdles!’  ’Now, Carlo! you know I mean the coins.  Methinks I recognise a text in one of them.’  Beatrice shrugged her shoulders, with a little yawn expressive of intolerable boredom.  ’Well,’ quoth Lanti impatiently, ’let him see it, you and he shall parable us for grace to meat, while these laggard dogs’—he looked over his shoulder, growling for his dinner.  Beatrice unclasped the cincture without a word, and flung it indifferently across the table.  She had lain as impassive throughout her own discussing by the others as a slave being negotiated in a market.  Not a tremor of her eyelids had acknowledged either her lord’s rudeness or Bembo’s provisional compliment.  The boy took up the belt and examined it.  He was conscious of a sweet perfume that had come into his hands with the trinket.  His lips were parted a little, his cheeks flushed.  Presently he put it down softly, and looked across at Beatrice.  ’It is what I thought,’ said he—’the coin, I mean—a denarius of Tiberius, in the thirty-first year of Our Lord Shall I tell you what it says to me, Madonna?’  She did not take the trouble to answer.  ’Yes,’ roared Carlo.  Bembo slung his lute to the front, and began coaxing forth one of those odd, shy accompaniments of his, into which, a moment later, his voice melted:—      ’When Tiberius was Emperor,     For thirty silver pieces bearing his image     Did Judas betray his Lord;     Then, himself betrayed to blood-guilt, cast them ringing     On the flags of the Temple, and maddened forth and died.     But the Jew elders eyed askance     The sleek, round coins, accurst and yet no whit     Depreciated as currency,     And ogling them and each other, were silent, till one spoke:     \"Ill come; well sped.  We need a place to bury the dead.     Let the Potter take these, and in return     Change us his field, o’er which we long have haggled.     So shall this outlay bring us two-fold profit,     Yet leave us conscience-clean before the Lord.\"      Thus, gentles dear, was bought \"The Field of Blood\";     And thus the wicked, damned price returned     Into the veins of traffic, there to circulate     And poison where it ran.     One piece found Hope, and changed was for Despair;     And Charity one led to hoard for self;     And one reached Faith, and Faith became a whore.     But, most of all, what had betrayed Love sore,     Sweet Love was used to betray for evermore.’   His voice broke on a long-drawn wailing chord.  A little silence succeeded.  Then, like one spent, he took up the belt and offered it to Beatrice.  ’O Madonna!’ he said, ’it is a denarius of the Cæsar that betrayed Love. Take back thy wages.’  She dragged down a spray of vine-leaves, and fanned herself furiously with it, making no other response.  ’So!  I am Judas!’ cried Carlo; and began to bite his moustache, mouthing and glowering.  ’Love!’ he sputtered, ’love!  Is there no love in nature?  You talk of the human God, you——’  Beatrice broke in scornfully:—  ’It is the world-wisdom of the monastery.  He shall sing you love only by the Litany.  His queen shall be a virgin immaculate, and her bosom a shrine for the white lambs of chastity to fold in.  A fine proselyte for passion’s understanding!  I would not be so converted for all Palestine.’  Carlo laughed, with some fierce recovery to good-humour.  ’Hearest her, Bernardo?  Thou shalt not prevail there, unless by convincing that thou speak’st from experience.’  Bembo had sunk down upon the bench, where, resting languidly, he still fingered the strings of his lute.  Now suddenly, steadfastly, he looked across at the girl, and began to sing again:—      ’Love kept me an hour     From all hours that pass;     In her breast, like a flower,     She stored it, sweet, fragrant,     Of all time the vagrant,       Alas, and alas!      Of all time the flower,     Of all hours that pass,     For me was that hour,     When I cared claim it,     And kiss it and shame it,       Alas, and alas!      I dared not, sweet hour—     I let thee go pass;     And heaven is my dower.     My crown is stars seven:     I am a saint in heaven,       Alas, and alas!’   He never took his eyes, while he sang, off the wondering face opposite him.  It was strangely transformed by the end—flesh startled out of ivory—the face of a wakened Galatea.  Narcisso coming at the moment to place the first dishes of the meal before the company, she sat up, her hands to her bosom, with a quick, agitated movement.  ’It is well,’ she said.  ’I am thy convert, saint in heaven!’  She lifted the dish before her, and held it out with a nervous smile.  ’Let us exchange pledges, by the token.  Give me thy meat, and take mine.’  Carlo, watching and listening, knitted his brow in a sudden frown, and his hand stole down to his belt.  ’Give me thy dish,’ said Beatrice, almost with entreaty.  Bernardo laughed.  With the finish of his madrigal he had pushed his lute, in a hurry of pink shame, to his shoulder.  ’Nay, Madonna,’ he protested.  ’Like the simplest doctor, I but spoke my qualifications.  Feeling is half-way to curing, and the best recommended physician is he who hath practised on himself.  I ask no reward but thy forbearance.’  ’Give it me,’ she still said.  She was on her feet.  She kissed the rim of the dish.  ’Wilt thou refuse now? Bid him to, Carlo.’  ’Not I,’ said Lanti.  ’Hath not, no more than myself, been whipped into the classics for nothing?  _Quod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum_. We know what that means, he and I.’  She seemed to turn very pale.  ’Nay,’ said Bernardo, jumping up, ’if Madonna condescends?’ and the exchange was made, and the men fell to.  In a moment or two Lanti looked up.  ’What ails thee, Beatrice?’  ’I am not hungry.’  The word had scarcely left her lips before, leaping to his feet, and sprawling across the table, he had snatched the untasted dish from under her hands, turned, and dashed it with its contents full in the face of Narcisso, who waited, with others, behind.  Fouled, bleeding, half-stunned, the man crashed down in a heap, and in the same instant his master was upon him, poniard in hand.  ’Confess, wretch, before I kill thee!’ he roared.  ’It was meant for my guest!  Thou wouldst have poisoned him.’  ’Mercy!’ shrieked the creature, through his filthy mask.  ’O lord, mercy!’  The girl, risen in her place, stood panting as if she had been running. She had voice no more than to gasp across, ’Bernardo!  For the love of God!  Bernardo!’ and that was all.  ’No mercy, beast!’ thundered Carlo.  ’Down with thee to hell unshriven!’  His strenuous lifted arm was caught in a baby grasp.  ’Carlo! forbear!  The right is mine!  Give me the knife!  Nay, I am the stronger!’  With the blood-lust halted in him for one moment, the powerful creature turned upon his puny assailant with a roar:—  ’The stronger!  Thou!’  Nevertheless he rose, though he held the reptile crushed under his foot, while the company, landlord and all, stood huddled aghast.  His breast was heaving like the pulse of a volcano.  ’The knife!’ he gurgled hoarsely; ’well, the right is thine, as thou sayest."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],["title","A Jay of Italy (#6)"],["body","it—under with thee, dog!—and drive in.’  Bembo seized and flung the dagger into the thick of the vines; then threw himself on his knees, and, with all his strength, tore the heavy foot from its victim.  ’Narcisso,’ he said, ’is it true? wouldst have slain Love!  Ah, fool, not to know that Love is immortal!’  ’Now, Christ in heaven,’ roared Carlo, ’if that shall save him!’  Bernardo rose, and sprang, and cast himself upon his breast, writhing his limbs about him.  ’Fly!’ he shrieked, ’fly! while I hold him!’  Then to Lanti: ’Ah, dear, do not hurt me, who owe thee so much!’  The fallen scoundrel was quick to the opportunity. He rose and fled, bloody and bemired, from the arbour. Madonna, seeing him escape, sunk, with a fainting sigh, upon her bench.  Carlo mouthed after his vanishing prey; yet he was tender with his burden.  ’Love!’ he groaned: ’Thou ow’st me?  Not this—so damned to folly! There, let go.  He was but the tool—and, for the rest——’  He glowered round.  ’Hush!’ said Bembo.  ’It is but the fruits of her teaching.  Blame not thy pupil, Carlo.’  ’_My_ pupil!’  ’Is she Christ’s—or art thou?  Love gives life, Carlo; and all life is God’s, since Christ redeemed it.’  ’What then?’  ’Why, is not thine honour thy life?’  ’I would die at least to prove it.’  ’Alas! and thou hast dishonoured love, which is life, which is God’s. Wouldst eat thy cake and have it, great schoolboy?’  ’Pish!  Art beyond me.’  ’Why, if love is life, and life is honour—ergo, love is honour.’  ’Is it?  I dare say.’  ’But thou must know it.’  ’I know nothing but that thou hast balked my vengeance; and with that, and having exercised thy jaw, let us go back to dinner.’  ’_Domine, emitte tuam lucem!_’ sighed Bembo.                                   *CHAPTER IV*   Galeazzo Maria Sforza, third Duke of Milan of his line, was very characteristically engaged in a very characteristic room of his resplendent castello of the Porta Giovia, which dominated the whole city from the north-east.  This room, buried like a captivating lust in the heart of the Rocca, or inner citadel of the castello, swarmed with those deft procurers to the great, panders between Art and emotion, who are satisfied, by contributing, each his share, to the glorification of a sensual despotism, to partake a rediffused flavour of its sum.  They were poets, painters, and musicians, sculptors and learned doctors, and every one, despite his independent calling, a sycophant.  Before the power, central and paramount, which alone in their particular orbit could amass within itself the total of their lesser lights, they prostrated themselves as before a God.  It is so in all ages of man.  He will contribute, of choice, to the prosperous charity; he will lay his gifts at the opulent shrine.  The worldling, says Shakespeare, makes his testament of more to much.  ’_Ah! c’est le plus grand roi du monde!_’ once cried Madame de Sévigné of Louis XIV., who had danced with her. ’He is the finest gentleman I have ever seen!’ cried Johnson enthusiastically at a later date, after an interview with Farmer George; and though—perhaps because—the stout old Colossus was as independent as reason itself, he spoke the general moral.  Professors were here, too, who did not blush to proclaim the exalted scion of Condottieri, the blood-lusting monster, the infernal atavism of Caligula, for the first gentleman in Italy, or to prostitute their erudition in his service.  It was Madonna Beatrice who had drawn that analogy, and there was plenty of justification for it; as also, it must be said, plenty of more immediate precedent for the abominations of this Galeazzo.  If, like the grand-matricidal Roman, he had poisoned his mother, the Visconti, his predecessors, with their atrocious blood-profanations and exaltations of bastardy, were responsible for the conditions which had made so dreadful an act conceivable.  If, emulating Caligula’s treatment of frail vestals, he had buried alive some too-accommodating virgin of the cloister, whom he had first debauched, he could quote the Visconti precedent of carnality indulged till it became a very ecstasy of fiend-possession.  Between old Rome and modern Milan, indeed, there was little to prefer.  Caligula used to throw spectators in the theatres to the beasts, having first torn out the tongues of his victims, lest his ears should be offended by their articulate appeals.  Bernabo Visconti and his brother, with whom he shared the duchy, agreed upon an edict subjecting State criminals to a scale of tortures which was calculated to culminate in death in not less than forty days. Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria, last of the accursed race, organised man-hunts in the streets of their capitals, and fed their hounds on human flesh.  To starve his victims to death, and, when they complained (it was an age of practical jokes), to stuff their mouths with filth, was a pet sport with Galeazzo.  Once, for a wretch who had killed a hare, a crime unpardonable, he procured a death of laughable, unspeakable torment by forcing him to devour the animal, bones and fur and all.  It is enough.  They were all madmen, in fact, moral abortions of that ’breeding-in’ of demi-gods which sows the world with chimeras.  It is not good for any man to be subject to no government but his own, and least of all when a vicious heredity has imposed a sickness on his reason.  Blood affinities on the near side of incest, power unquestioned, unbridled self-indulgences—these are no progenitors of temperance and liberality.  Amongst savages, generations of inter-marryings will but refine exquisitely on savagery; and the despots of this era were little more than the last expressions of a decadent barbarism.  Galeazzo, and such as Galeazzo, were, it is true, to project the long shadows of their lusts and cruelties over the times forthcoming; yet it is as certain that with him the limits of the worst were reached, and hereafter peoples and rulers were to grow to some common accord of participation in the enlightenments of their ages.  One might have fancied in him, in his apparent reachings to foreclose on such a state, to appropriate to himself not its moral but its material accessories, some uneasy premonition of the truth.  He stood on the line of partition, his sympathies with the past, his greed for the opulent future, and, hesitating, was presently to drop between.  That paradox of the lusts of savagery and the lusts of intellect hobnobbing in the individual, which characterised so many of his contemporaries, cried aloud in him.  He was superstitious and a sceptic.  Like Malatesta of Rimini—who could enshrine beneath the shadow of one glorious church the bones of a favourite mistress and those of an admired heathen philosopher which he had brought expressly from Greece for the purpose—he would make a compromise between Paganism and Christianity. He worshipped God and the devil, as if his arrogance halted at nothing short of reconciling two equal but antagonistic powers.  He surrounded himself with monks and infidels; acclaimed impartially an illuminated psalter or a painting for a bagnio, a Roman canticle or a hymn to the Paphian Venus; sobbed in the soft throbbings of a lute, and went sobbing to witness a captive’s torturing; conceived himself an enlightened patron of the arts, and, in a mad caprice, ordered his craftsmen, under penalty of instant death, to paint and hang with portraits of the ducal family in a single night a hall of the castello.  He groped and grovelled in bestiality; founded a library and peopled a university with erudition; encouraged profligacy and printing; was covetous and lavish, and splendid as the clusters of diamonds on a Jewess’s unclean fingers. His palaces swarmed with cutthroats and physicians, philosophers and empirics, pimps and theologians, heaven-commissioned artists and pope-commissioned agents for indulgences, who would sell one absolution beforehand for the foulest excesses in lust or violence.  His crowded halls were the very stage of the ante-renaissance, where the priest, the poisoner, the romantic hero and the sordid villain, the flaunting doxy and the white dove of innocence, rubbed shoulders with the scene-painter and conductor in a disordered rehearsal of the melodrama to come. And so we alight on him in this Rocca, sinister and lonely, the protagonist of the piece to which he was in a little to supply the most tragic dénouement.  He lay sunk back in pillows on a couch set in an alcove high and apart. One long, jewelled hand caressed the head of a boarhound.  Judged by the swift code of his times, he was already mature, a sage of thirty-one. His eyes were small and deep-seated under gloomy thatches, his forehead narrow and receding, his cheeks ravenous, his nose was hooked.  But in contrast with this pinched hunger of feature were the bagging chin and sensual neck, as well as the grossness of the body, which attenuated into feeble legs.  One could not look on him and gather from crown to foot the assurance of a single generous youthful impulse.  The curse of an inherited despotism had wrinkled him from his birth.  An effeminate luxury, which was presently to make Milan a byword among the austerer principalities, spoke in his dress.  His short-skirted tunic, puff-shouldered, and pinched and pleated at the waist within a gem-encrusted girdle, was of Damascene silk, rose-coloured and lined with costliest fur.  His hose were of white satin; his slippers, of crimson velvet, sparkled with rosettes of diamonds and rubies.  On his head he wore a cap of maintenance, also of red velvet, and sewn with pearls; and a short jewelled dagger hung at his waist.  By his side, a very foil to his magnificence, stood one in a sad-coloured cloak.  This was Lascaris, a Greek professor, whom he had invited to Milan for his learning, and used, like Pharaoh, to expound him his dreams. For he was subject to evil dreams, was this Galeazzo—hauntings and visions which wrought in him"]]]
