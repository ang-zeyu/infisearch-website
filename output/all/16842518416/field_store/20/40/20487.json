The Vitality of \"Mormonism\"  _An Address_   BY  JAMES E. TALMAGE  OF THE COUNCIL OF THE TWELVE, CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS    PUBLISHED BY THE CHURCH   Salt Lake City 1917    PREFATORY NOTE  The following pages embody an address delivered by invitation at a meeting of the Denver Philosophical Society, at Denver, Colorado, December 14th, 1916, by Dr. James E. Talmage.  The address has already been printed through the daily press and in magazine pages; and it is presented herewith in convenient form, suitable for preservation.  The conciseness, clearness, and accuracy with which the subject is treated commend it to the attention of interested and studious readers.  THE PUBLISHERS.  Salt Lake City, Utah, January, 1917.    The Vitality of \"Mormonism\"  Why does \"Mormonism\" persist? Determined attempts were made both openly and by stealth to strangle the system at its birth, to destroy the mustard seed at the time of the planting; and, as the fact of its survival has become prominent the certainty of its impending demise has been announced time and again; the fall of the umbrageous tree, amidst whose branches the birds of search continue to find food and shelter, has been often predicted.  On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized as a body corporate at Fayette in the State of New York; and the names of but six persons are of record as those of actual participants. True, by that time a few times six had identified themselves with the new and unprecedented movement; but, as the laws of the State specified six as the required number of incorporators, only that number took part in the legal procedure. And they, save one, were relatively unknown and in fact obscure.  The name of Joseph Smith had already been heard beyond his home district. He was at the time a subject of rapidly spreading notoriety if not of enviable fame. The Book of Mormon, purporting to be a record of the aboriginal peoples of the Western Continent, particularly an account of the dealings of God with those peoples, in short the Scriptures of what came afterward to be called the New World, had already been published. It was in reference to the title page of this work that the appellation \"Mormon,\" first given in derision as a nickname, was fastened upon the members of the Church.  Such a beginning as that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints may seem to afford little ground of either hope or fear as to future developments; nevertheless, the newly established Church was made the subject of assault from its inception. What was there to cause hostile concern over the voluntary association of six men and a few of their friends in an organization of openly expressed purpose, and that purpose the peaceful promulgation of what they verily believed to be. the uplifting religion of life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  Whatever may be the answer to the query, the fact that the Church met determined opposition, increasingly severe from the beginning, is abundantly attested by history. While active persecutors and openly avowed assailants were comparatively few, the majority of those who gave any attention to the matter treated \"Mormonism\" with aggressive disdain; and contempt in the affairs of human endeavor has not infrequently proved itself a more effective weapon than physical assault. In this instance violence and outrage resulted.  I invite your attention to \"The Vitality of 'Mormonism'\" under a convenient classification, though, as will be seen, the divisions are inter-related and merge intimately together. Let us consider:  1. Facts attesting the vitality and virility of the Church.  2. Some causes thereof.  3. Some of the results.    1. _Facts attesting the Vitality and Virility of the Church_.  Today the \"Mormon\" Church is known by name at least throughout the civilized world as well as amongst most of the semi-cultured peoples in the remoter parts of the earth and on the islands of the sea. Since 1830 every year has witnessed an increase in membership and an extension of \"Mormon\" propaganda. The six have increased to over half a million adherents. In Utah and adjacent States, in Canada and Mexico, between seventy and eighty \"Stakes of Zion\" have been established, each Stake comprising several Wards, of which there are now over seven hundred and fifty; and the greater part of North America outside the established Stakes, as also many foreign countries, are covered by well organized Missions, each with its component Conferences and Branches.  The growth of the Church is apparent to even the poorly informed. But the Church has not only grown; it has developed. Between growth and development there is a difference of the most essential kind; and not a few of the grave mistakes of men, even in every day affairs, in business, in politics, in statesmanship are traceable to our confusing and confounding the two. Growth alone is the result of accretion, the accumulation of material, the amassing of stuff. Development involves an extension of function, a gradation of efficiency, a passing from immaturity to maturity, from infancy to manhood.  Growth produces big things, and not only things of this sort but men. Between bigness and greatness, however, there is a distinction of kind, not alone of degree. Growth is a measure of bulk, of quantity; it is defined as \"so many\" or \"so much.\" Development is a gradation of quality; its terms are \"so good\" or \"so bad.\" America boasts of a constantly increasing host of big men; the great men of the land may be more easily counted. And as with men so with institutions.  Dead things may grow, as witness the tiny salt crystal in its mother-brine at first a microscopic cube, then a huge hexahedron limited only by the size of the container or other external conditions. Development, however, is the characteristic of life to which mere growth is essentially secondary and subordinate. The acorn holds in potential reserve all the possibilities of the stately oak; within the tiny egg of the butterfly lies the future caterpillar and the hidden glory of the mature imago.  The vital character of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was evident from the first. In masterly parable, superb in conception and application, the kingdom of heaven has been likened unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal; and, behold, from it the mass became leavened. I make bold to affirm that the leaven of \"Mormonism\" is leavening the world and its theology.  The most objectionable feature of \"Mormonism\" today appears to be its name. The fundamental principles of the system, its revealed truths, are more readily accepted when unlabeled. Every studious reader of recent commentaries on the Holy Scriptures, and of theological treatises in general, is aware of a surprising progressiveness in modern views of things spiritual, amounting in many instances to an abandonment of what were once regarded as the fundamentals of orthodoxy.  _In the new theology \"Mormonism\" has pioneered the way_. I admit that so radical an assertion calls for evidence; and in its support I shall ask your unbiased consideration of a few illustrative instances. As the examples to be cited, however, must have place in any exposition of the causes to which the vitality of the \"Mormon\" system of religion is to be ascribed, and as I assume that the actuality of the growth and vitality of \"Mormonism\" will not be contested, I pass in the interest of brevity to the second division.    2._Some Causes to which the Vitality of \"Mormonism\" is due_.  \"Mormonism\" is definite and incisive in its claims. It speaks to the world in no uncertain tone. Its voice is virile; its activities are strong. It presents an unbroken front, and is unafraid. Its attitude is not tile, nevertheless it is strongly aggressive. Its methods of work are those of reason and persuasion, coupled with a fearless affirmation of testimony as to the surpassing importance of its message, which message it labors to convey to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.  \"Mormonism\" lives because it is healthy, normal and undeformed. In general, a healthy organism is assured of life, barring destruction from external violence or deprivation of physical necessities; whereas one that is abnormal and sickly is doomed to decline. Opposition to the Church, the pitiless maltreatment to which its people have been subjected, comprising mobbings, drivings, spoliation, scourgings, assassination, and murder marked by every conceivable accompaniment of barbarity, have operated to strengthen the Church, body and soul. True, the heat of persecution has scorched and withered a few of the sickly plants such as had no depth of sincerity; but the general effect has been to promote a fuller growth, and to make richer and more fertile the Garden of the Lord.  \"Mormonism\" thrives and is extending its influence, leavening the thoughts of men, because its distinctive doctrines are those of progression, in accord with the better manifestations of the spirit of the times, best adapted to meet the vital needs of the age. The timeliness of its establishment is significant and largely explanatory of its success.  The seed of the restored Gospel was planted by the Divine Husbandman only after due preparation of the soil. The place of planting was no less carefully selected than the time of seeding. In the economy of God, America, which is veritably the land of Zion, was aforetime consecrated as the home of a free and independent nation. Only in such soil could the germ of the Gospel of true liberty sprout and thrive.  \"Mormonism\" lives because its claims are consistent and its position impregnable. It affirms the literal fulfilment of scriptural predictions of a great falling away from the truth, a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46099"],["title","The Vitality of \"Mormonism\": An Address (#1)"],["body","of spiritual gifts and Divine authority, in short a world-wide apostasy from the Church established by the Lord Jesus Christ in the meridian of time. This condition of apostasy is that pictured by Isaiah:      \"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because     they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the     everlasting covenant.\" (Isaiah 24:5.)  And by Amos, in his fateful utterance:      \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a     famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,     but of hearing the words of the Lord: And they shall wander from     sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to     and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.\" (Amos     8:11, 12.)  The certainty of a general declension in spirituality among men, the rise of false Christs and false prophets, of mystic and deceiving voices from the desert and from secret chambers was foretold by the Christ Himself (Matt. 24:4-5, 10, 13, 25-26). So avowed also the Apostles Peter (2 Peter 2:1-3), and Paul (Acts 20:29-30, 1 Tim. 4:1-3, 2 Tim. 4:1-4, 2 Thess. 2:3-4), Jude (17, 18), and John (Rev. 13:4, 6-9).  The apostate condition of Christendom has been recognized and affirmed by high ecclesiastical authority Let a single citation suffice. The Church of England thus proclaims the fact of degeneracy, as set forth in her \"Homily against Peril of Idolatry,\" published about the middle of the sixteenth century and retained to this day as an official declaration:      \"So that laity and clergy, learned and unlearned, all ages, sects,     and degrees of men, women, and children of whole Christendom an     horrible and most dreadful thing to think have been at once drowned     in abominable idolatry; of all other vices most detested of God,     and most damnable to man; and that by the space of eight hundred     years and more.\"  No less definite than the prophecy of apostasy is the scriptural prediction of a restoration in the last days:      \"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the     everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and     to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a     loud voice, Fear God, and give, glory to him; for the hour of his     judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and     the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" (Rev. 14:6-7.)  \"Mormonism\" affirms that the \"everlasting Gospel\" has been restored to earth in the manner specified, that is by angelic ministration. The necessity of a restoration postulates the prior removal of the thing restored; and the restoration of the Gospel is proof of the precedent apostasy of mankind. But, it may be asked, had not we the Holy Bible, the scriptural repository of the Gospel record? The letter, yes. But surely the Gospel is more than a book. The Holy Bible prescribes administrative ordinances as essential to salvation baptism by water and the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the authoritative imposition of hands, the rebirth of water and of the Spirit, without which, unless the Lord Christ spoke to Nicodemus falsely, no man can enter the kingdom of God. Who will venture to affirm that a possession of a copy of the Holy Bible, or even a letter-perfect memorization of the contents thereof, can give to men the right to administer in the ordinances therein prescribed?  The angel seen by the Revelator while on Patmos was to restore not the letter of requirement as to baptism and other essentials, for this the world had; but he was to bring again to earth the commission to officiate in those saving ordinances, that is, to restore the authority of the Holy Priesthood.  \"Mormonism\" affirms that on the 15th of May, 1829, a heavenly messenger descended in light and glory, and, laying his hands upon Joseph Smith and his companion in the ministry, Oliver Cowdery, bestowed upon them the Lesser or Aaronic Priesthood, saying:      \"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer     the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering     of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by     immersion for the remission of sins.\"  The angelic personage announced himself as John, known of old as the Baptist, and declared that he acted under instructions from Peter, James, and John, who held the presidency of the Higher or Melchizedek Priesthood in the apostolic dispensation of old. At a later date Joseph Smith and his fellow laborer were visited by Peter, James, and John, who ordained the two to the Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, which comprises all the authority operative in the Church of Jesus Christ.  Whatever criticism may be offered, exception taken, or denial asserted against these solemn declarations, the consistency of the claims themselves must be admitted. Authority to officiate in the ordinances of the Gospel was brought by angel messengers, and they the very ones in whom were vested the powers of the respective order of Priesthood in the earlier Gospel dispensation. This same strict consistency appears in subsequent manifestations. Thus Moses appeared in the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, and conferred the keys of the gathering of the tribes of Israel after their long dispersion, which work is abundantly predicted in ancient scripture as a characteristic feature of the latter days the time immediately precedent to the glorious advent of the Son of Man. Elijah the prophet, in literal fulfilment of Malachi's prediction (Mai. 4:5-6) has brought and committed to the modern prophet the authority of vicarious labor in behalf of the dead, by which the hearts of the departed fathers are turned to their living posterity, and the hearts of the yet mortal children drawn to their progenitors in the spirit world. True to this particular commission, the restored Church rears temples to the name and service of the living God, and in those sacred structures carries forward vicarious service for the redemption of the uncounted dead who have passed away in ignorance as to the necessity of compliance with the laws and ordinances of the Gospel, without which compliance no man may see the kingdom of God.  Such facts as those cited attest the consistency of the distinctive claims of \"Mormonism\"; and consistency goes far to establish genuineness. \"Mormonism\" would long since have gone the way of all false creeds and systems had its precepts been inconsistent, incongruous, or unscriptural.  \"Mormon\" doctrines are characteristically advanced and progressive, and herein lies a further explanation of the virility of the system. While in no respect at variance with earlier scriptures, \"Mormonism\" carries principles forward, and many of the obscure passages of ancient writ are illumined by the rays of modern revelation. As stated, \"Mormonism\" leads the way to higher truths. Now, by way of a few examples as promised:  (A) The unscriptural and repellent dogma of inherent degeneracy and the contaminating effect of original sin, by which every child is born vile in the sight and judgment of God, long cast its dark shadow over the minds of men. From this conception sprang the practise of infant baptism and the perverted doctrine of assured damnation for all innocent babes who die unbaptized. Even the Catholic church has modified its teaching on this subject and today permits its members to believe that children who die without baptism pass to a state of partial happiness and content, though forever denied the supreme blessing of the beatific vision of God. It is conceded, of course, that no dictum, dogma, or doctrine of men can determine the fate of souls, infant or adult, in the hereafter; nevertheless, theological teachings have direct effect upon the thoughts and lives of mankind. It is cheering to know that practically all Christendom today repudiates the frightful heresy of the eternal condemnation of babes who die without baptism.  Hear now the word of \"Mormonism\" on the matter and note the time of its enunciation. In 1830 the Book of Mormon was given to the world. Therein we read, in an epistle of the ancient prophet Mormon to his son Moroni:      \"Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your     God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous, but     sinners to repentance: the whole need no physician, but they that     are sick; wherefore little children are whole, for they are not     capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken     from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of     circumcision is done away in me. And after this manner did the Holy     Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore my beloved son, I     know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize     little children. Behold I say unto you, That this thing shall ye     teach, repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and     capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent     and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children,     and they shall all be saved with their little children. And their     little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold,     baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto     the remission of sins. But little children are alive in Christ,     even from the foundation of the world.\" (Moroni 8:8-12.)  In the revelations of the current dispensation we read that children are accounted innocent before God until they come to the age of understanding and accountability, and that baptism is required of all who have attained that condition. Thus we read:      \"All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be     baptized and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits,     and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all     their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name"]]]
