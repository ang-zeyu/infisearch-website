Only difference is you swing on your chute straps just to get used to them instead of from the old apple tree. And if you don’t fasten your straps just right you get a good bump.”  “And you learn by bumps,” Sally laughed.  “Yes, and that way you don’t get killed later.”  “It’s the same way with the slide,” the instructor added. “It’s just a kid’s slide, only longer, and you fall harder—that is, if you don’t relax properly.”  After that, for a full week-the two girls practiced swinging, sliding, tumbling, whirling round and round.  “I feel as if I’d been put in a cement mixer and whirled round and round a thousand times,” Sally confided to Danny on Saturday afternoon. “But I do believe that Barbara will go through with it. Monday is our zero hour. We drop at dusk. And I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”  “I’ll say a prayer for you,” Danny grinned. “And now about this secret code of the gremlins, the enemy subs, or what have you.”  “Yes—yes!” Sally exclaimed eagerly. “What did you find out?”  “A whole lot and yet, not half enough. Come over just after chow, if you can. Bring the radios and I’ll tell you all.”  “Oh, no! Surely not that much!” Sally held up her hands in mock horror. “All the same, I’ll be there!”  “It’s like this,” Danny said, as they sat before the radio that night listening to the “put-put-put-a-put.” “They’ve made their code from numbers that can be divided evenly. I’m sure of that. But does one stand for the letter A, or have they arranged it all backwards?”  “They may have started in the middle and gone both ways.”  “Yes, but I don’t think they did. Why should they? They had the wave-length all to themselves. Why not have a simple code? I even think they let one stand for A, three for B, five for C, and so on.”  “What makes you think that?”  “Because eleven, which should stand for E, is used more times than any other number and E is the most-used letter in the alphabet. Other vowels stand out in the same proportion. So I think we’ve got that far. But now,” he sighed, “we’ve got to find out whether they’re sending in German or English. That is going to be hard.”  “And must be continued in our next.” There was a suggestion of gloom in Sally’s voice. She was tired and sore. Much lay ahead.  “Monday we drop from that hole in the sky. Tuesday we take our finals,” she sighed.  “And Wednesday you scatter,” he supplied. “I got that on good authority. Some of you go to other schools and some to work, depending on what you’re taking up.”  “That’s about it. We’ll just have to work and hope we meet again over this blessed, tantalizing, mesmerizing radio,” she laughed. “And now, what do you say we take the radio over to my house and then make a night of it?”  And that was just what they did.  Monday afternoon came, and with it, many a long-drawn breath.  “Sally, I’m scared,” Barbara whispered, as they piled into the car that was to take them on their last trip to the field.  “You wouldn’t be natural if you weren’t,” was the cheering response. “All the same, try to forget it.”  In the week that had passed, the eight of them, two girls and six boys, had formed the habit of singing on the way out. Now, when at last they rolled away, a youthful voice struck up:            He’d fly through the air with the greatest of ease,           A daring young man on the flying trapeze.  “Where have I heard that before?” another boy groaned. For all that, they sang it with gusto.  “‘Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main,’” came next.  Then the boy from Kentucky started:  “‘The sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home—’”  His voice broke on the second line. Sally swallowed hard, but they sang it through to the end.  “Ioway! Ioway!” shouted the boy from the midwest. “That’s where the tall corn grows.”  They all laughed, but when the strains of “Swanee River” came rolling out, they were in a mellow mood once more.  When they arrived at the field they found a captive balloon straining at its ropes. Beneath it hung a platform and at the very center of the platform was a round hole.  “That,” said Sally, “is the famous hole in the sky.”  “On fields where paratroops are trained we have towers to jump from, but they cost a pile of money. A balloon works just as well,” a friendly lieutenant explained.  “Sure, even better,” wisecracked the boy from Kentucky. “Then if you don’t feel like dropping off, you can just cut the rope and go for a balloon ride.”  “I’m in favor of a balloon ride right now,” said his pal.  A latticework of ropes formed a wall about the platform. Over this they climbed. Then, slowly, majestically the balloon rose skyward.  Once more—“‘Sailing, sailing,’” rang out on the air.  “Old Kentucky Home” was a little too much this time. It expired in the middle of the second verse.  “Pack Up Your Troubles” went very well and the “Man on the Flying Trapeze” was as popular as ever.  One big fellow they called Samson sat hunched up in a corner, not singing and saying nothing.  “What’s the matter? Scared?” Sally asked.  “Thunder, no!” he exploded. “Sleepy, that’s all. What’s a little parachute jump? If you’d grown up on a cattle ranch with the big bulls chasin’ you and the lonesome coyotes callin’, you wouldn’t mind. I fell off a mountain once and no parachute stopped me, just a pine tree.”  “I’m scared,” Barbara whispered. Sally made no reply. Truth was, her stomach was pumping in a strange way. She saw the boy from Kentucky gulp twice. That didn’t help any.  “We’re about there,” the instructor announced. “If your stomachs don’t feel good, forget it. That’s the way mine feels right now, and I’ve jumped three hundred times.  “Now remember,” he added, “when you slide off, keep looking up. That way your chin doesn’t hook on the parachute straps.  “Now,” he said in a strong, clear voice, “we’re here. See that green light? That’s the signal. Don’t be nervous. Your parachutes have been properly rigged. I watched it done. Don’t forget, I’ll be right behind you.”  Before they went up, they had been given numbers. Barbara’s number was seven, Sally’s eight. That meant that, except for the instructor, they would be last. Sally did not know whether this was good or bad. For Barbara to go first would be terrible. But would watching the others disappear wear away her slender thread of courage? She could only hope that it would not.  “Action stations,” the instructor snapped. Number one, the big fellow raised on a cattle ranch, took his place, dangling his feet over the hole. With his arms hanging straight down, he looked up.  “Number one!” The big fellow vanished into the thin air below. “Number two!” One more vanished. Sally’s throat went dry. “Number three!” There they went. “Number four!” Oppressive silence followed. Sally gasped. Had something gone wrong? Then she remembered they were to go down by fours, with a space between each group. “Two fast sticks,” they called it. She felt quite like a stick just then.  Unconsciously, she began to count—one, two, three, four. She mopped her brow. She dared not look at Barbara. “Five, six, seven.” She had reached fifteen when the instructor took up the counting once more. “Number five.” One more man vanished.  “Get ready,” Sally whispered. On Barbara’s face was a look of do-or-die.  “Number six.” The last boy vanished.  “Now.” Barbara slid into her place. Her hands were at her sides, her chin high. When she heard “Number seven” she slid from sight.  In her eagerness to follow, Sally nearly went down without an order. As it was, she sank breathlessly down until, with startling suddenness, she felt a pull at her straps and knew her parachute had opened.  “Good old chute!” she murmured as she glanced up to catch its white gleam against the sky.  She looked for Barbara. Yes, there she was off to the left, floating down with the greatest of ease. This was Barbara’s big moment, perhaps the biggest moment of all her life.  [Illustration: “Good Old Chute!” Sally Murmured]  But here was a voice coming up from below: “You’re coming down nicely, number seven,” it said. That would be Barbara.  “Number four, bend those knees. Don’t be trying to land stiff legged.” It was the voice again. An instructor was talking through a loudspeaker. His voice carried up to them perfectly.  “Number eight,” he called.  “Oh! He’s calling me!” Sally thought in sudden panic. “Number eight, you must turn round. Reach up, grab the strap.” Sally obeyed. She swung half about. “That’s it. Always land with the wind, not against it.  “Now, all of you, knees bent, feet together, relax, relax for a fall.”  One by one they tumbled on the ground, then jumped up laughing.  Sally made a quick count. Yes, all eight were up and moving. Then, having unfastened her parachute, she rushed over to Barbara to exclaim:  “Barbara! You were wonderful!”  Throwing her arms about her, Barbara burst into tears of joy.  When the shower had passed, she exclaimed, “Now I am going to be a parachute rigger always, for I know just how much it means!”  “Boy, oh, boy!” Sally exclaimed when at last she was alone with her instructor. “I hope I get a chance to make use of that experience. That certainly was something!”  “It’s been my experience,” he replied soberly, “that in this war, sooner or later, we find a place for every bit of practice we’ve ever had. Your time will come.”  Would it? Sally wondered a long, long wonder. She was still wondering when she got back to school. Secret radios, ships, airplanes, parachutes, all went round and round in her head. What was in store for her? In a day or two she would be whirled away to another school for further training.  “And after that, what?” she asked the elm that had once saved her from disaster. The elm whispered to the breeze, but she could not understand what the tree and the breezes were saying.

There was one happy evening hour when Sally, Nancy, Barbara, and Danny had lunch together in the Purple Cow, just off the campus. Theirs was the hail-and-farewell of good fellows well met, of soldiers who might never meet again. And yet, behind all their jokes and laughter was a feeling of friendship and devotion to one another that in all the years could never die.  “We’ll be seeing you,” they shouted next morning.  “Oh, sure! We’ll be together again, sooner than you think!”  “Good-by!”  “Good-by!”  Sally and Nancy were sent to the beautiful campus of a great mid-western university where they would learn much more about radio and communications. Barbara was shipped off to a big airport to receive her final training in the art of rigging parachutes. Danny remained behind, but not for long. The autumn winds would soon whisk him away to new fields of adventure and duty.  Both Sally and Nancy had dreamed of attending some truly great university. And, at last, here they were. But for how long? Just long enough to make you efficient in your chosen field, was the precise answer. “And always remember, your services are badly needed right now. Good communications and radio men are scarce. They are badly needed overseas.”  “But won’t we two be sent overseas?” Nancy asked of the major who gave them the information.  “That remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain, no WAVE will be sent overseas until she has perfected herself in her particular branch, and has served long enough at one of our bases here in America to prove that she will be a valuable addition to our Navy, either aboard ship or overseas.”  “Right here is where I forget this Gothic architecture, the shady walks, the cozy nooks that help to make this big school what it is,” Sally said, as a look of determination spread over her face. “I’m going to work and study day and night, for we are in the Navy now.”  “I’m right behind you,” Nancy agreed. “All the same, when this terrible scrap is over, I’m coming right back here and be a regular student as long as I please. And believe me, I’m going to have all the trimmings—class dances, proms, shady walks and all the rest.”  “Shake on that.” Sally held out her hand. That handshake was a solemn ceremony.  “And now to business.”  From that time on their heads were bent, for long hours, over study desks, radios, clattering keys.  Their day was not done when darkness fell, nor their week when Saturday rolled round. They did not, like Barbara, hide under the covers to study with a flashlight when night came. They rented bicycles for the entire period of their stay at the university. On many a night farmers saw strange lights winking and blinking from one hill to another in their pastures. Sally and Nancy were practicing the light-blinking code they had studied that day. Twice they were reported as spies, but nothing came of it for they never returned to the same pasture twice, and it would have been a fleet-footed farm boy who could have rounded them up in the dark.  Saturday afternoon, armed with dozens of multicolored flags, they returned to these same hills to practice flag signals. White and blue with a notch in the end stood for A, blue, white, red, white and blue in stripes was C, and so on and on to white with a red spot for one, blue with a white spot for two, and so on.  With good memories and a zeal for learning seldom witnessed by those gray stone walls, they went through the school in record time and were once more on the move.  “Now we’re really going to work,” Sally cried, enthusiastically.  “Yes, and at one of the biggest air bases on our long seacoast,” Nancy agreed.  “Florida and the sea. Um—” Sally breathed, “that’s worth working for.”  “It sure is!”  “There’s something else I’m going to work harder than ever for—” Sally spoke with conviction.  “What’s that?”  “I’m going to try to cut ‘Florida and the sea’ down to just the good, old ‘sea.’ All my life I’ve waited for that.”  “Oh, I don’t know. There are the enemy sub-packs. They’re really dangerous. The water’s awfully cold.”  “That’s just it.” Sally’s eyes shone. “There are the sub-packs—you haven’t forgotten our secret radios?”  “Almost,” Nancy admitted.  “I tried them twice back at the U, when you were gone,” Sally confided. “Nothing doing. Guess we were too far from the sea.”  “Florida will be better.”  “Much better, but the sea will be better still.”  “I suppose so,” Nancy replied dreamily. “But don’t forget, your enemy sub-pack may turn out to be friendly ships or planes.”  “I won’t forget. All the same, I want to know.”  “Wonder where Danny is.”  “And Barbara.”  “Oh! I forgot to tell you. I had a letter from Barbara this morning. Guess where she is now?”  “Where we’re going?”  “That’s just where she is. Won’t it be great if you can hop off from the sky with her again?” Nancy laughed.  “I wouldn’t mind. I’ll bet you an ice-cream soda I’ll have a chance to use that experience before the year is over.”  “Easy aces! You’re on. If I never win another bet, that’s one for me.”  Was Nancy too confident? In this world at war many strange things can happen, and many do.  Not so long after that, Sally found herself seated on the top of a high tower that overlooked a vast airfield. The skies were full of floating planes. The roar of powerful motors beat upon her eardrums. In her hand she held a score sheet, and, at the steady, carefully spoken words of a marine in a major’s uniform, she recorded hours, moments, numbers, and names.  On the officer’s head was a set of earphones. About his neck a chin-speaker was attached. From time to time, speaking always in that steady, even tone, he said:  “Come on down, six, four, three. Wind velocity, fifteen miles per hour, north-north-east.”  And again: “Circle once more, three-six-eight. Fast one coming in from the east.”  There were long periods of time when he said nothing, just stood there staring dreamily away toward the sea. But always he appeared to listen, as indeed he did, for listening to the radio voice of great four-motored bombers, inviting them to come in, advising them to wait, telling them when to take off, informing them regarding weather, was his duty. And on his ears, eyes and voice hung the life of many a fine young flier.  Red Storm, his fellow officers called him, some times “Silent Storm.” His real name was Robert Storm. Silent Storm was the name Sally liked best, although, of course, she never called him that, always Major Storm.  He seemed young for a major and certainly was handsome in a big, tall, red-headed way. He seldom spoke to her except to instruct her in her work. He was teaching her his own work, so she could take his place. Nancy too was learning the work, but at a different period.  As Major Storm stood there looking away during quiet times, she often wondered about that faraway look in his eyes. Then, too, there was the long scar across his right cheek and the look of utter weariness that came over his face at times when he slumped down in his chair.  “Major Storm,” she said one day, speaking with a sudden impulse that surprised her, “what does one do to make people want one as a friend?”  “You don’t make people want you as a friend,” was his quick reply. “They either wish to be your friend or they don’t, and that’s all there is to it.”  “Are—are you sure?” she asked a little startled.  “Absolutely.”  “Well, then, they might not care to have you as a friend but you might be able to do something that would make them wish to do something for you—you know, like—”  “Yes, I know what you mean. The answer to that is simple then. Take an interest in them first. Find out about their lives, their families, their problems. Have a sympathetic interest in them. If they’re human, they’ll do the same for you. That’s simple, isn’t it?”  “Very simple.”  Suddenly, he spoke in a different tone: “Come on in, Johnny.”  After sweeping the sky with his binoculars, he settled down in his chair.  “That radio boy on that big bomber is Johnny, one of my own boys. I taught him. He’s a fine boy. I suppose the war will get him sooner or later. It seems rather useless to care for them too much. They go away and—”  “You never see them again.”  “That’s right.”  “But, by the way,” his voice rose, “you have one very good friend, eminently worth while, I’d say.”  “I have several,” she smiled. She was happy, happier than she had been for days. She had really started Silent Storm talking. “But then,” she thought with a shy smile, “who ever heard of a really, truly silent storm, anyway?”  “This friend of yours,” he said quietly, “is also a very old friend of mine—old C. K., we used to call him.”  “You don’t mean C. K. Kennedy!” She stared in disbelief.  “That’s exactly who I do mean. He taught me most of what I know about radio. He’s one man in a million.”  “Oh! Then—” she exclaimed, “then we’re practically cousins!”  “Something like that,” he replied dryly.  Then, springing to his feet, he said: “Okay—come in, three-two-six.”  And that was all for then. Evening was coming on. Many big ships were coming in through the blue. Every moment was taken from then to the end of the shift. Yes, that was all for then, but it was enough to keep the girl dreaming in the golden twilight, under the palms when the day’s work was done. And those were strange dreams. Secret radios, ships, submarines, giant four-motored bombers, old C. K. and Silent Storm were all there in one glorious mixup of lights and shadows.                                  CHAPTER EIGHT                             DANGER IS MY DUTY   Since there were many WAVES stationed at this great air and marine base, they had taken over a very fine little hotel down by the sea.  “Nancy! This is gorgeous!” Sally had exclaimed on their arrival. “If it weren’t for the secret radio, I would be glad to stay here until the war is won.”  “It _is_ wonderful,” Nancy replied thoughtfully. “Florida, the blue, blue sea, and these lovely quarters! It’s really hard to believe, "]]]
