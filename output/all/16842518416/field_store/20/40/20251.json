New leaks were forthcoming, but Hiram Blenkinsop conceived the notion of stopping them with poultices of white lead and bandages of canvas bound with fine wire. They dripped and many of the pipes of Bingville looked as if they were suffering from sprained ankles and sore throats, but Hiram had prevented another deluge.  The price of coal had driven the people of Bingville back to the woods for fuel. The old wood stoves had been cleaned and set up in the sitting-rooms and kitchens. The saving had been considerable. Now, so many men were putting in their time on the house and grounds of J. Patterson Bing and the new factory at Millerton that the local wood dealer found it impossible to get the help he needed. Not twenty-five per cent. of the orders on his books could be filled.  Mr. Bing's house was finished in October. Then Snodgrass announced that he was going to take it easy as became a man of his opulence. He had bought a farm and would only work three days a week at his trade. Sneed had also bought a farm and acquired a feeling of opulence. He was going to work when he felt like it. Before he tackled any leaking pipes he proposed to make a few leaks in the deer up in the Adirondacks. So the roofs and the plumbing had to wait.  Meanwhile, Bingville was in sore trouble. The ancient roof of its respectability had begun to leak. The beams and rafters in the house of its spirit were rotting away. Many of the inhabitants of the latter regarded the great J. Patterson Bing with a kind of awe--like that of the Shepherd of the Birds. He was the leading citizen. He had done things. When J. Patterson Bing decided that rest or fresh air was better for him than bad music and dull prayers and sermons, and that God was really not much concerned as to whether a man sat in a pew or a rocking chair or a motor-car on Sunday, he was, probably, quite right. Really, it was a matter much more important to Mr. Bing and his neighbors than to God. Indeed, it is not at all likely that the ruler of the universe was worrying much about them. But when J. Patterson Bing decided in favor of fun and fresh air, R. Purdy--druggist--made a like decision, and R. Purdy was a man of commanding influence in his own home. His daughters, Mabel and Gladys, and his son, Richard, Jr., would not have been surprised to see him elected President of the United States, some day, believing that that honor was only for the truly great. Soon Mrs. Purdy stood alone--a hopeless minority of one--in the household. By much pleading and nagging, she kept the children in the fold of the church for a time but, by and by, grew weary of the effort. She was converted by nervous exhaustion to the picnic Sunday. Her conscience worried her. She really felt sorry for God and made sundry remarks calculated to appease and comfort Him.   Now all this would seem to have been in itself a matter of slight importance. But Orville Gates, the superintendent of the mill, and John Seaver, attorney at law, and Robert Brown, the grocer, and Pendleton Ames, who kept the book and stationery store, and William Ferguson, the clothier, and Darwin Sill, the butcher, and Snodgrass, the carpenter, and others had joined the picnic caravan led by the millionaire. These good people would not have admitted it, but the truth is J. Patterson Bing held them all in the hollow of his hand. Nobody outside his own family had any affection for him. Outwardly, he was as hard as nails. But he owned the bank and controlled credits and was an extravagant buyer. He had given freely for the improvement of the village and the neighboring city of Hazelmead. His family was the court circle of Bingville. Consciously or unconsciously, the best people imitated the Bings.  Judge Crooker was, one day, discussing with a friend the social conditions of Bingville. In regard to picnic Sundays he made this remark: \"George Meredith once wrote to his son that he would need the help of religion to get safely beyond the stormy passions of youth. It is very true!\"  The historian was reminded of this saying by the undertow of the life currents in Bingville. The dances in the Normal School and in the homes of the well-to-do were imitations of the great party at J. Patterson Bing's. The costumes of certain of the young ladies were, to quote a clause from the posters of the Messrs. Barnum and Bailey, still clinging to the bill-board: \"the most daring and amazing bareback performances in the history of the circus ring.\" Phyllis Bing, the unrivaled metropolitan performer, set the pace. It was distinctly too rapid for her followers. If one may say it kindly, she was as cold and heartless and beautiful in her act as a piece of bronze or Italian marble. She was not ashamed of herself. She did it so easily and gracefully and unconsciously and obligingly, so to speak, as if her license had never been questioned. It was not so with Vivian Mead and Frances Smith and Pauline Baker. They limped and struggled in their efforts to keep up. To begin with, the art of their modiste had been fussy, imitative and timid. It lacked the master touch. Their spirits were also improperly prepared for such publicity. They blushed and looked apologies and were visibly uncomfortable when they entered the dance-hall.   On this point, Judge Crooker delivered a famous opinion. It was: \"I feel sorry for those girls but their mothers ought to be spanked!\"  There is evidence that this sentence of his was carried out in due time and in a most effectual manner. But the works of art which these mothers had put on exhibition at the Normal School sprang into overwhelming popularity with the young men and their cards were quickly filled. In half an hour, they had ceased to blush. Their eyes no longer spoke apologies. They were new women. Their initiation was complete. They had become in the language of Judge Crooker, \"perfect Phyllistines!\"  The dancing tried to be as naughty as that remarkable Phyllistinian pastime at the mansion of the Bings and succeeded well, if not handsomely. The modern dances and dress were now definitely established in Bingville.  Just before the holidays, the extension of the ample home of the millionaire was decorated, furnished, and ready to be shown. Mrs. Bing and Phyllis who had been having a fling in New York came home for the holidays. John arrived the next day from the great Padelford School to be with the family through the winter recess. Mrs. Bing gave a tea to the ladies of Bingville. She wanted them to see the improvements and become aware of her good will. She had thought of an evening party, but there were many men in the village whom she didn't care to have in her house. So it became a tea.  The women talked of leaking roofs and water pipes and useless bathrooms and outrageous costs. Phyllis sat in the Palm Room with the village girls. It happened that they talked mainly about their fathers. Some had complained of paternal strictness.  \"Men are terrible! They make so much trouble,\" said Frances Smith. \"It seems as if they hated to see anybody have a good time.\"  \"Mother and I do as we please and say nothing,\" said Phyllis. \"We never tell father anything. Men don't understand.\"  Some of the girls smiled and looked into one another's eyes.  There had been a curious undercurrent in the party. It did not break the surface of the stream until Mrs. Bing asked Mrs. Pendleton Ames, \"Where is Susan Baker?\"  A silence fell upon the group around her.  Mrs. Ames leaned toward Mrs. Bing and whispered, \"Haven't you heard the news?\"  \"No. I had to scold Susan Crowder and Martha Featherstraw as soon as I got here for neglecting their work and they've hardly spoken to me since. What is it?\"  \"Pauline Baker has run away with a strange young man,\" Mrs. Ames whispered.  Mrs. Bing threw up both hands, opened her mouth and looked toward the ceiling.  \"You don't mean it,\" she gasped.  \"It's a fact. Susan told me. Mr. Baker doesn't know the truth yet and she doesn't dare to tell him. She's scared stiff. Pauline went over to Hazelmead last week to visit Emma Stacy against his wishes. She met the young man at a dance. Susan got a letter from Pauline last night making a clean breast of the matter. They are married and stopping at a hotel in New York.\"  \"My lord! I should think she _would_ be scared stiff,\" said Mrs. Bing.  \"I think there is a good reason for the stiffness of Susan,\" said Mrs. Singleton, the wife of the Congregational minister. \"We all know that Mr. Baker objected to these modern dances and the way that Pauline dressed. He used to say that it was walking on the edge of a precipice.\"  There was a breath of silence in which one could hear only a faint rustle like the stir of some invisible spirit.  Mrs. Bing sighed. \"He may be all right,\" she said in a low, calm voice.  \"But the indications are not favorable,\" Mrs. Singleton remarked.  The gossip ceased abruptly, for the girls were coming out of the Palm Room.  The next morning, Mrs. Bing went to see Susan Baker to offer sympathy and a helping hand. Mamie Bing was, after all, a good-hearted woman. By this time, Mr. Baker had been told. He had kicked a hole in the long looking-glass in Pauline's bedroom and flung a pot of rouge through the window and scattered talcum powder all over the place and torn a new silk gown into rags and burnt it in the kitchen stove and left the house slamming the door behind him. Susan had gone to bed and he had probably gone to the club or somewhere. Perhaps he would commit suicide. Of all this, it is enough to say that for some hours there was abundant occupation for the tender sympathies of Mrs. J. Patterson Bing. Before she left, Mr. Baker had returned for luncheon and seemed to be quite calm and self-possessed when he greeted her in the hall below stairs.  On entering her home, about one o'clock, Mrs. Bing received a letter from the hand of Martha.  \"Phyllis"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44796"],["title","The Prodigal Village: A Christmas Tale (#5)"],["body"," me to give you this as soon as you returned,\" said the girl.  \"What does this mean?\" Mrs. Bing whispered to herself, as she tore open the envelope.  Her face grew pale and her hands trembled as she read the letter.        \"_Dearest Mamma_,\" it began. \"I am going to Hazelmead for luncheon      with Gordon King. I couldn't ask you because I didn't know where      you were. We have waited an hour. I am sure you wouldn't want me to      miss having a lovely time. I shall be home before five. Don't tell      father! He hates Gordon so.       \"_Phyllis._\"   \"The boy who insulted her! My God!\" Mrs. Bing exclaimed in a whisper. She hurried to the door of the butler's pantry. Indignation was in the sound of her footsteps.  \"Martha!\" she called.  Martha came.  \"Tell James to bring the big car at once. I'm going to Hazelmead.\"  \"Without luncheon?\" the girl asked.  \"Just give me a sandwich and I'll eat it in my hand.\"  \"I want you to hurry,\" she said to James as she entered the glowing limousine with the sandwich half consumed.  They drove at top speed over the smooth, state road to the mill city. At half past two, Mrs. Bing alighted at the fashionable Gray Goose Inn where the best people had their luncheon parties. She found Phyllis and Gordon in a cozy alcove, sipping cognac and smoking cigarettes, with an ice tub and a champagne bottle beside them. To tell the whole truth, it was a timely arrival. Phyllis, with no notion of the peril of it, was indeed having \"a lovely time\"--the time of her young life, in fact. For half an hour, she had been hanging on the edge of the giddy precipice of elopement. She was within one sip of a decision to let go.  Mrs. Bing was admirably cool. In her manner there was little to indicate that she had seen the unusual and highly festive accessories. She sat down beside them and said, \"My dear, I was very lonely and thought I would come and look you up. Is your luncheon finished?\"  \"Yes,\" said Phyllis.  \"Then let us go and get into the car. We'll drop Mr. King at his home.\"  When at last they were seated in the limousine, the angry lady lifted the brakes in a way of speaking.  \"I am astonished that you would go to luncheon with this young man who has insulted you,\" she said.  Phyllis began to cry.  Turning to young Gordon King, the indignant lady added: \"I think you are a disreputable boy. You must never come to my house again--_never_!\"  He made no answer and left the car without a word at the door of the King residence.   There were miles and miles of weeping on the way home. Phyllis had recovered her composure but began again when her mother remarked, \"I wonder where you learned to drink champagne and cognac and smoke cigarettes,\" as if her own home had not been a perfect academy of dissipation. The girl sat in a corner, her eyes covered with her handkerchief and the only words she uttered on the way home were these: \"Don't tell father!\"  While this was happening, Mr. Baker confided his troubles to Judge Crooker in the latter's office. The Judge heard him through and then delivered another notable opinion, to wit: \"There are many subjects on which the judgment of the average man is of little value, but in the matter of bringing up a daughter it is apt to be sound. Also there are many subjects on which the judgment of the average woman may be trusted, but in the matter of bringing up a daughter it is apt to be unsound. I say this, after some forty years of observation.\"  \"What is the reason?\" Mr. Baker asked.  \"Well, a daughter has to be prepared to deal with men,\" the Judge went on. \"The masculine temperament is involved in all the critical problems of her life. Naturally the average man is pretty well informed on the subject of men. You have prospered these late years. You have been so busy getting rich that you have just used your home to eat and sleep in. You can't do a home any good by eating and snoring and reading a paper in it.\"  \"My wife would have her own way there,\" said Baker.  \"That doesn't alter the fact that you have neglected your home. You have let things slide. You wore yourself out in this matter of money-getting. You were tired when you got home at night--all in, as they say. The bank was the main thing with you. I repeat that you let things slide at home and the longer they slide the faster they slide when they're going down hill. You can always count on that in a case of sliding. The young have a taste for velocity and often it comes so unaccountably fast that they don't know what to do with it, so they're apt to get their necks broken unless there's some one to put on the brakes.\"  Mr. Emanuel Baker arose and began to stride up and down the room.  \"Upon my word, Judge! I don't know what to do,\" he exclaimed.  \"There's only one thing to do. Go and find the young people and give them your blessing. If you can discover a spark of manhood in the fellow, make the most of it. The chances are against that, but let us hope for the best. Above all, I want you to be gentle with Pauline. You are more to blame than she is.\"  \"I don't see how I can spare the time, but I'll have to,\" said Baker.  \"Time! Fiddlesticks!\" the Judge exclaimed. \"What a darn fool money makes of a man! You have lost your sense of proportion, your appreciation of values. Bill Pritchard used to talk that way to me. He has been lying twenty years in his grave. He hadn't a minute to spare until one day he fell dead--then leisure and lots of leisure it would seem--and the business has doubled since he quit worrying about it. My friend, you can not take a cent into Paradise, but the soul of Pauline is a different kind of property. It might be a help to you there. Give plenty of time to this job, and good luck to you.\"  The spirit of the old, dead days spoke in the voice of the Judge--spoke with a kindly dignity. It had ever been the voice of Justice, tempered with Mercy--the most feared and respected voice in the upper counties. His grave, smooth-shaven face, his kindly gray eyes, his noble brow with its crown of white hair were fitting accessories of the throne of Justice and Mercy.  \"I'll go this afternoon. Thank you, Judge!\" said Baker, as he left the office.   Pauline had announced in her letter that her husband's name was Herbert Middleton. Mr. Baker sent a telegram to Pauline to apprise her of his arrival in the morning. It was a fatherly message of love and good-will. At the hotel in New York, Mr. Baker learned that Mr. and Mrs. Middleton had checked out the day before. Nobody could tell him where they had gone. One of the men at the porter's desk told of putting them in a taxicab with their grips and a steamer trunk soon after luncheon. He didn't know where they went. Mr. Baker's telegram was there unopened. He called at every hotel desk in the city, but he could get no trace of them. He telephoned to Mrs. Baker. She had heard nothing from Pauline. In despair, he went to the Police Department and told his story to the Chief.  \"It looks as if there was something crooked about it,\" said the Chief. \"There are many cases like this. Just read that.\"  The officer picked up a newspaper clipping, which lay on his desk, and passed it to Mr. Baker. It was from the _New York Evening Post_. The banker read aloud this startling information:        \"'The New York police report that approximately 3600 girls have run      away or disappeared from their homes in the past eleven months, and      the Bureau of Missing Persons estimates that the number who have      disappeared throughout the country approximates 68,000.'\"   \"It's rather astonishing,\" the Chief went on. \"The women seem to have gone crazy these days. Maybe it's the new dancing and the movies that are breaking down the morals of the little suburban towns or maybe it's the excitement of the war. Anyhow, they keep the city supplied with runaways and vamps. You are not the first anxious father I have seen to-day. You can go home. I'll put a man on the case and let you know what happens.\"     CHAPTER THREE  WHICH TELLS OF THE COMPLAINING COIN AND THE MAN WHO LOST HIS SELF   There was a certain gold coin in a little bureau drawer in Bingville which began to form a habit of complaining to its master.  \"How cold I am!\" it seemed to say to the boy. \"I was cold when you put me in here and I have been cold ever since. Br-r-r! I'm freezing.\"  Bob Moran took out the little drawer and gave it a shaking as he looked down at the gold piece.  \"Don't get rattled,\" said the redoubtable Mr. Bloggs, who had a great contempt for cowards.  It was just after the Shepherd of the Birds had heard of a poor widow who was the mother of two small children and who had fallen sick of the influenza with no fuel in her house.  \"I am cold, too!\" said the Shepherd.  \"Why, of course you are,\" the coin answered. \"That's the reason I'm cold. A coin is never any warmer than the heart of its owner. Why don't you take me out of here and give me a chance to move around?\"  Things that would not say a word to other boys often spoke to the Shepherd.  \"Let him go,\" said Mr. Bloggs.  Indeed it was the tin soldier, who stood on his little shelf looking out of the window, who first reminded Bob of the loneliness and discomfort of the coin. As a rule whenever the conscience of the boy was touched Mr. Bloggs had something to say.  It was late in February and every one was complaining of the cold. Even the oldest inhabitants of Bingville could not recall so severe a winter. Many families were short of fuel. The homes of the working folk were insufficiently heated. Money in the bank had given them a sense of security. They could not believe that its magic power would fail to bring them what they needed. So they had been careless of their allowance of wood and coal. There were days when they had none and could get none at the yard. Some of them took boards out of their barn floors and cut down shade trees and broke up the worst of their furniture to feed the kitchen stove in those days of famine. Some men"]]]
