In mercy, let me in!\"   \"The holy saints forbid!\" declared my sire.   My mother sobbed and vowed whole pounds of wax   To St. Eustachio, would he but remove   This fearful presence from her door. Then sharp   Came click of lock, and a long tube was thrust   From out the window, and my brother cried,   \"Spirit or devil, go! or else I fire!\"    Where should I go? Back to the ghastly tomb   And the cold coffined ones? Up the long street,   Wringing my hands and sobbing low, I went.   My feet were bare and bleeding from the stones;   My hands were bleeding too; my hair hung loose   Over my shroud. So wild and strange a shape   Saw never Florence since. The people call   That street through which I walked and wrung my hands   \"Street of the Dead One,\" even to this day.   The sleeping houses stood in midnight black,   And not a soul was in the streets but I.    At last I saw a flickering point of light   High overhead, in a dim window set.   I had lain down to die; but at the sight   I rose, crawled on, and with expiring strength   Knocked, sank again, and knew not even then   It was Antonio's door by which I lay.    A window opened, and a voice called out:   \"Qui e?\" \"I am Ginevra.\" And I thought,   \"Now he will fall to trembling, like the rest,   And bid me hence.\" But, lo! a moment more   The bolts were drawn, and arms whose very touch   Was life, lifted and clasped and bore me in.   \"O ghost or angel of my buried love,   I know not, care not which, be welcome here!   Welcome, thrice welcome, to this heart of mine!\"   I heard him say, and then I heard no more.    It was high noontide when I woke again,   To hear fierce voices wrangling by my bed,--   My father's and my husband's; for, with dawn,   Gathering up valor, they had sought the tomb,   Had found me gone, and tracked my bleeding feet   Over the pavement to Antonio's door.   Dead, they cared nothing: living, I was, theirs.   Hot raged the quarrel; then came Justice in,   And to the court we swept--I in my shroud--   To try the cause.               This was the verdict given:   \"A woman who has been to burial borne,   Made fast and left and locked in with the dead;   Who at her husband's door has stood and plead   For entrance, and has heard her prayer denied;   Who from her father's house is urged and chased,   Must be adjudged as dead in law and fact.    The Court pronounces the defendant--dead!   She can resume her former ties at will,   Or may renounce them, if such be her will.   She is no more a daughter, or a spouse,   Unless she choose, and is set free to form   New ties, if so she choose.\"                             O, blessed words!   That very day we knelt before the priest,   My love and I, were wed, and life began.    Child of my child, child of Antonio's child,   Bend down and let me kiss your wondering face.   'Tis a strange tale to tell a rose like you.   But time is brief, and, had I told you not,   Haply the story would have met your ears   From them, the Amieri, my own blood,   Now turned to gall, whose foul and bitter lips   Will wag with lies when once my lips are dumb.   (Pardon me, Virgin. I was gentle once,   And thou hast seen my wrongs. Thou wilt forgive.)   Now go, my dearest. When they wake thee up,   To tell thee I am dead, be not too sad.   I, who have died once, do not fear to die.    Sweet was that waking, sweeter will be this.   Close to Heaven's gate my own Antonio sits   Waiting, and, spite of all the Frati say,   I know I shall not stand long at that gate,   Or knock and be refused an entrance there,   For he will start up when lie hears my voice,   The saints will smile, and he will open quick.   Only a night to part me from that joy.   Jesu Maria! let the dawning come.       EASTER LILIES.    Darlings of June and brides of summer sun,     Chill pipes the stormy wind, the skies are drear;   Dull and despoiled the gardens every one:       What do you here?    We looked to see your gracious blooms arise     Mid soft and wooing airs in gardens green,   Where venturesome brown bees and butterflies       Should hail you queen.    Here is no bee nor glancing butterfly;     They fled on rapid wings before the snow:   Your sister lilies laid them down to die,       Long, long ago.    And here, amid the slowly dropping rain,     We keep our Easter feast, with hearts whose care   Mars the high cadence of each lofty strain,       Each thankful prayer.    But not a shadow dims your joyance sweet,     No baffled hope or memory darkly clad;   You lay your whiteness at the Lord's dear feet,       And are all glad.    O coward soul! arouse thee and draw near,     Led by these fragrant acolytes to-day!   Let their sweet confidence rebuke thy fear,       Thy cold delay.    Come with thy darkness to the healing light,     Come with thy bitter, which shall be made sweet,   And lay thy soil beside the lilies white,       At His dear feet!     EBB-TIDE.    Long reaches of wet grasses sway   Where ran the sea but yesterday,   And white-winged boats at sunset drew   To anchor in the crimsoning blue.   The boats lie on the grassy plain,   Nor tug nor fret at anchor chain;   Their errand done, their impulse spent,   Chained by an alien element,   With sails unset they idly lie,   Though morning beckons brave and nigh;   Like wounded birds, their flight denied,   They lie, and long and wait the tide.    About their keels, within the net   Of tough grass fibres green and wet,   A myriad thirsty creatures, pent   In sorrowful imprisonment,   Await the beat, distinct and sweet,   Of the white waves' returning feet.   My soul their vigil joins, and shares   A nobler discontent than theirs;   Athirst like them, I patiently   Sit listening beside the sea,   And still the waters outward glide:   When is the turning of the tide?    Come, pulse of God; come, heavenly thrill!   We wait thy coming,--and we will.   The world is vast, and very far   Its utmost verge and boundaries are;   But thou hast kept thy word to-day   In India and in dim Cathay,   And the same mighty care shall reach   Each humblest rock-pool of this beach.   The gasping fish, the stranded keel,   This dull dry soul of mine, shall feel   Thy freshening touch, and, satisfied,   Shall drink the fulness of the tide.     FLOOD-TIDE.    All night the thirsty beach has listening lain,      With patience dumb,   Counting the slow, sad moments of her pain;      Now morn has come,   And with the morn the punctual tide again.    I hear the white battalions down the bay      Charge with a cheer;   The sun's gold lances prick them on their way,--      They plunge, they rear,--   Foam-plumed and snowy-pennoned, they are here!    The roused shore, her bright hair backward blown,      Stands on the verge   And waves a smiling welcome, beckoning on      The flying surge,   While round her feet, like doves, the billows crowd and urge.    Her glad lips quaff the salt, familiar wine;      Her spent urns fill;   All hungering creatures know the sound, the sign,--      Quiver and thrill,   With glad expectance crowd and banquet at their will.    I, too, the rapt contentment join and share;      My tide is full;   There is new happiness in earth, in air:      All beautiful   And fresh the world but now so bare and dull.    But while we raise the cup of bliss so high,      Thus satisfied,   Another shore beneath a sad, far sky      Waiteth her tide,   And thirsts with sad complainings still denied.    On earth's remotest bound she sits and waits      In doubt and pain;   Our joy is signal for her sad estates;      Like dull refrain   Marring our song, her sighings rise in vain.    To each his turn--the ebb-tide and the flood,      The less, the more--   God metes his portions justly out, I know;      But still before   My mind forever floats that pale and grieving shore.     A YEAR.    She has been just a year in Heaven.   Unmarked by white moon or gold sun,   By stroke of clock or clang of bell,   Or shadow lengthening on the way,   In the full noon and perfect day,   In Safety's very citadel,   The happy hours have sped, have run;   And, rapt in peace, all pain forgot,   She whom we love, her white soul shriven,   Smiles at the thought and wonders not.    We have been just a year alone,--   A year whose calendar is sighs,   And dull, perpetual wishfulness,   And smiles, each covert for a tear,   And wandering thoughts, half there, half here,   And weariful attempts to guess   The secret of the hiding skies,   The soft, inexorable blue,   With gleaming hints of glory sown,   And Heaven behind, just shining through.    So sweet, so sad, so swift, so slow,   So full of eager growth and light,   So full of pain which blindly grows,   So full of thoughts which either way   Have passed and crossed and touched each day,   To us a thorn, to her a rose;   The year so black, the year so white,   Like rivers twain their course have run;   The earthly stream we trace and know,   But who shall paint the heavenly one?    A year! We gather up our powers,   Our lamps we consecrate and trim;   Open all windows to the day,   And welcome every heavenly air.   We will press forward and will bear,   Having this word to cheer the way:   She, storm-tossed once, is safe with Him,   Healed, comforted, content, forgiven;   And while we count these heavy hours   Has been a year,--a year in Heaven.     TOKENS.    Each day upon the yellow Nile, 'tis said.   Joseph, the youthful ruler, cast forth wheat,   That haply, floating to his father's feet,--   The sad old father, who believed him dead,--   It might be sign in Egypt there was bread;   And thus the patriarch, past the desert sands   And scant oasis fringed with thirsty green,   Be lured toward the love that yearned unseen.   So, flung and scattered--ah! by what dear hands?--   On the swift-rushing and invisible tide,   Small tokens drift adown from far, fair lands,   And say "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4560"],["title","Verses (#3)"],["body","us, who in the desert bide,   \"Are you athirst? Are there no sheaves to bind?   Beloved, here is fulness; follow on and find.\"       HER GOING.  SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE.    She stood in the open door,     She blessed them faint and low:     \"I must go,\" she said, \"must go       Away from the light of the sun,       Away from you, every one;   Must see your eyes no more,--     Your eyes, that love me so.    \"I should not shudder thus,     Nor weep, nor be afraid.     Nor cling to you so dismayed,       Could I only pierce with ray eyes       Where the dark, dark shadow lies;   Where something hideous     Is hiding, perhaps,\" she said.    Then slowly she went from them,     Went down the staircase grim,     With trembling heart and limb;       Her footfalls echoed       In the silence vast and dead,   Like the notes of a requiem,     Not sung, but uttered.    For a little way and a black     She groped as grope the blind,     Then a sudden radiance shined,       And a vision her eyelids burned;       All joyfully she turned,   For a moment turned she back,     And smiled at those behind.    There in the shadows drear     An angel sat serene,     Of grave and tender mien,       With whitest roses crowned;       A scythe lay on the ground,   As reaping-time were near,--     A burnished scythe and a keen.    She did not start or pale     As the angel rose and laid     His hand on hers, nor said       A word, hut beckoned on;       For a glorious meaning shone   On the lips that told no tale,     And she followed him, unafraid.    Her friends wept for a space;     Then one said: \"Be content;     Surely some good is meant       For her, our Beautiful,--       Some glorious good and full.   Did you not see her face,     Her dear smile, as she went?\"     A LONELY MOMENT.         I sit alone in the gray,          The snow falls thick and fast,        And never a sound have I heard all day          But the wailing of the blast,   And the hiss and click of the snow, whirling to and fro.         There seems no living thing          Left in the world but I;        My thoughts fly forth on restless wing,          And drift back wearily,   Storm-beaten, buffeted, hopeless, and almost dead.         No one there is to care;          Not one to even know        Of the lonely day and the dull despair          As the hours ebb and flow,   Slow lingering, as fain to lengthen out my pain.         And I think of the monks of old,          Each in his separate cell,        Hearing no sound, except when tolled          The stated convent bell.   How could they live and bear that silence everywhere?         And I think of tumbling seas,          'Neath cruel, lonely skies;        And shipwrecked sailors over these          Stretching their hungry eyes,--   Eyes dimmed with wasting tears for weary years on years,--         Pacing the hopeless sand,          Wistful and wan and pale,        Each foam-flash like a beckoning hand,          Each wave a glancing sail,   And so for days and days, and still the sail delays.         I hide my eyes in vain,          In vain I try to smile;        That urging vision comes again,          The sailor on his isle,   With none to hear his cry, to help him live--or die!         And with the pang a thought          Breaks o'er me like the sun,        Of the great listening Love which caught          Those accents every one,   Nor lost one faintest word, but always, always heard.         The monk his vigil pale          Could lighten with a smile,        The sailor's courage need not fail          Upon his lonely isle;   For there, as here, by sea or land, the pitying Lord stood             close at hand.         O coward heart of mine!          When storms shall beat again,        Hold firmly to this thought divine,          As anchorage in pain:   That, lonely though thou seemest to be, the Lord is near,             remembering thee.     COMMUNION.          What is it to commune?   It is when soul meets soul, and they embrace   As souls may, stooping from each separate sphere         For a brief moment's space.          What is it to commune?   It is to lay the veil of custom by,   To be all unafraid of truth to talk,         Face to face, eye to eye.          Not face to face, dear Lord;   That is the joy of brighter worlds to be;   And yet, Thy bidden guests about Thy board,         We do commune with Thee.          Behind the white-robed priest   Our eyes, anointed with a sudden grace,   Dare to conjecture of a mighty guest,         A dim beloved Face.          And is it Thou, indeed?   And dost Thou lay Thy glory all away   To visit us, and with Thy grace to feed         Our hungering hearts to-day?          And can a thing so sweet,   And can such heavenly condescension be?   Ah! wherefore tarry thus our lingering feet?         It can be none but Thee.          There is the gracious ear   That never yet was deaf to sinner's call;   We will not linger, and we dare not fear,         But kneel,--and tell Thee all.          We tell Thee of our sin   Only half loathed, only half wished away,   And those clear eyes of Love that look within         Rebuke us, seem to say,--          \"O, bought with my own blood,   Mine own, for whom my precious life I gave,   Am I so little prized, remembered, loved,         By those I died to save?\"          And under that deep gaze   Sorrow awakes; we kneel with eyelids wet,   And marvel, as with Peter at the gate,         That we could so forget,          We tell Thee of our care,   Of the sore burden, pressing day by day,   And in the light and pity of Thy face         The burden melts away.          We breathe our secret wish,   The importunate longing which no man may see;   We ask it humbly, or, more restful still,         We leave it all to Thee.          And last our amulet   Of precious names we thread, and soft and low   We crave for each beloved, or near or far,         A blessing ere we go.          The thorns are turned to flowers,   All dark perplexities seem light and fair,   A mist is lifted from the heavy hours,         And Thou art everywhere.     A FAREWELL.          Go, sun, since go you must,   The dusky evening lowers above our sky,     Our sky which was so blue and sweetly fair;   Night is not terrible that we should sigh.     A little darkness we can surely bear;   Will there not be more sunshine--by and by?          Go, rose, since go you must,   Flowerless and chill the winter draweth nigh;     Closed are the blithe and fragrant lips which made   All summer long perpetual melody.     Cheerless we take our way, but not afraid:   Will there not be more roses--by and by?          Go, love, since go you must,   Out of our pain we bless you as you fly;     The momentary heaven the rainbow lit   Was worth whole days of black and stormy sky;     Shall we not see, as by the waves we sit,   Your bright sail winging shoreward--by and by?          Go, life, since go you must,   Uncertain guest and whimsical ally!     All questionless you came, unquestioned go;   What does it mean to live, or what to die?     Smiling we watch you vanish, for we know   Somewhere is nobler living--by and by.     EBB AND FLOW.    How easily He turns the tides!     Just now the yellow beach was dry,   Just now the gaunt rocks all were bare,     The sun beat hot, and thirstily   Each sea-weed waved its long brown hair,     And bent and languished as in pain;   Then, in a flashing moment's space,     The white foam-feet which spurned the sand   Paused in their joyous outward race,     Wheeled, wavered, turned them to the land,   And, a swift legionary band,     Poured oil the waiting shores again.    How easily He turns the tides!     The fulness of my yesterday   Has vanished like a rapid dream,     And pitiless and far away   The cool, refreshing waters gleam:     Grim rocks of dread and doubt and pain    Rear their dark fronts where once was sea;     But I can smile and wait for Him   Who turns the tides so easily,     Fills the spent rock-pool to its brim,   And up from the horizon dim     Leads His bright morning waves again.     ANGELUS.    Softly drops the crimson sun:     Softly down from overhead,   Drop the bell-notes, one by one,     Melting in the melting red;   Sign to angel bands unsleeping,--     \"Day is done, the dark is dread,   Take the world in care and keeping.    \"Set the white-robed sentries close,     Wrap our want and weariness   In the surety of repose;     Let the shining presences,   Bearing fragrance on their wings,     Stand about our beds to bless,   Fright away all evil things.    \"Rays of Him whose shadow pours     Through all lives a brimming glory,   Float o'er darksome woods and moors,     Float above the billows hoary;   Shine, through night and storm and sin,     Tangled fate and bitter story,   Guide the lost and wandering in!\"    Now the last red ray is gone;     Now the twilight shadows hie;   Still the bell-notes, one by one,     Send their soft voice to the sky,   Praying, as with human lip,--     \"Angels, hasten, night is nigh,   Take us to thy guardianship.\"     THE MORNING COMES BEFORE THE SUN.    Slow buds the pink dawn like a rose     From out night's gray and cloudy sheath;   Softly and still it grows and grows,     Petal by petal, leaf by leaf;   Each sleep-imprisoned creature breaks     Its dreamy fetters, one by one,   And love awakes, and labor wakes,--     The morning comes before the sun.    What is this message from the light     So fairer far than light can be?   Youth stands a-tiptoe, eager, bright,    In haste the risen sun to see;   Ah! check thy lunging, restless heart,    Count the charmed moments as they run,   It is life's best and fairest part,    This morning hour before the sun.    When once thy day shall burst to flower,     When once the sun shall climb the sky,   And busy hour by busy hour,     The urgent noontide draws anigh;   When the long shadows creep abreast,     To dim the happy task half done,"]]]
