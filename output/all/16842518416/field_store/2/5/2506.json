The sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest, the most conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest mark for the gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native sage-brush well understand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter.  Many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but the open seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few remnants still exist are determined to have them, all; and the state legislatures seem disposed to allow the killers to have their way. It may be however, that like New York with the heath hen, they will arouse and virtuously lock the stable door--after the horse has been stolen!  [Illustration: SAGE GROUSE The First of the Upland Game Birds that will Become Extinct]  THE SNOWY EGRET AND AMERICAN EGRET, (_Egretta candidissima and Herodias egretta_).--These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by the commercially valuable \"aigrette\" plumes that they bear, have had a very narrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite all the efforts made to save them. The \"plume-hunters\" of the millinery trade have been, _and still are_, determined to have the last feather and the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter in at least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by a plume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through the heaven-born \"sympathy\" of a local jury.  Of the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the whole story ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,--all there were,--were killed _in the breeding season_, when the plumes were ripe for the market; and millions of young birds starved in their nests. It was a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attacked by the plume-hunters, and in two or three days utterly destroyed. The same bloody work is going on to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and the stories and \"affidavits\" stating that the millions of egret plumes being shipped annually from those countries are \"shed feathers,\" \"picked up off the ground,\" are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those lies are perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See Chapter XIII).  By 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets that Florida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the Colorado desert.  Until Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana, became a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soon would become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny has certainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egret and heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 it was an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons are living and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species are safe in at least one spot in our own country.  [Illustration: SNOWY EGRETS IN THE McILHENNY EGRET PRESERVE It is at This Period That the Parent Birds are Killed for Their Plumes, and the Young Starve in the Nest Photo by E.A. McIlhenny]  Three years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the United States, who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of both egrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries accessible to plume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years ago, the secret discovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted William Dutcher, President of the National Association of Audubon Societies, and Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the protection of those colonies. With a fund contributed for the purpose, wardens were hired and duly commissioned. As previously stated, one of those wardens was shot dead in cold blood by a plume hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeries from the attacks of money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes were worth their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There is now one warden in Florida who says that \"before they get my rookery they will first have to get me.\"  Thus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has been successful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told, about 5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are guarded by the Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird Island, a mile out in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably defended by Oscar E. Baynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guarded rookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds, to and from their feeding-grounds, and shoot them in transit. Their motto is--\"Anything to beat the law, and get the plumes.\" It is there that the state of Florida should take part in the war.  The success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year a number of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts--for the first time in many years. And so to-day the question is, can the wardens continue to hold the plume-hunters at bay?  THE WOOD-DUCK (_Aix sponsa_), by many bird-lovers regarded as the most beautiful of all American birds, is threatened with extinction, in all the states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight. Long ago (1901) the U.S. Biological Survey sounded a general alarm for this species by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance, and advising its protection by long close seasons. To their everlasting honor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-season laws. This, is the  ROLL OF HONOR  CONNECTICUT MAINE MASSACHUSETTS NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW JERSEY NEW YORK VERMONT WEST VIRGINIA  [Illustration: WOOD DUCK Regularly Killed as \"Food\" in 15 States]  And how is it with the other states that number the wood-duck in their avian faunas? I am ashamed to tell; but it is necessary that the truth should be known.  Surely we will find that if the other states have not the grace to protect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will not penalize it by extra long open seasons.  _A number of them have taken pains to provide extra long_ OPEN _seasons on this species, usually of five or six months!!_ And this for a bird so exquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining on birds of paradise. Here is a partial list of them:         *        *        *        *        *  WOOD-DUCK-EATING STATES (1912)  Georgia kills and eats the Wood-duck from Sept. 1, to Feb. 1. Indiana, Iowa and Kansas      do so    \"  Sept. 1, to Apr. 15. Kentucky, (extra long!)     does so    \"  Aug. 15, to Apr. 1. Louisiana (extra long!)       \"   \"    \"  Sept. 1, to Mar. 1.

The above are the states that really possess the wood-duck and that should give it, one and all, a series of five-year close seasons. Now, is not the record something to blush for?  Is there in those fifteen states _nothing_ too beautiful or too good to go into the pot?         *        *        *        *        *  THE WOODCOCK _(Philohela minor)_, is a bird regarding which my bird-hunting friends and I do not agree. I say that as a species it is steadily disappearing, and presently will become extinct, unless it is accorded better protection. They reply: \"Well, I can show you where there are woodcock yet!\"  A few months ago a Nova Scotian writer in _Forest and Stream_ came out with the bold prediction that three more years of the usual annual slaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of extinction in that Province.  It is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species:  \"Last fall [1911, at Norwalk, Conn.] we had a good flight of woodcock, and it is a shame the way they were slaughtered. I know of a number of cases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day, and heard of one case of fifty. This is all wrong, and means the end of the woodcock, if continued. There is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock, as much as on quail or partridge.\" (\"Woodcock\" in _Forest and Stream_, Mar. 2, 1912.)  As far back as 1901, Dr. A.K. Fisher of the Biological Survey predicted that the woodcock and wood-duck would both become extinct unless better protected. As yet, the better protection demanded has not materialized to any great extent.  Says Mr. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, in his admirable \"Special Report,\" p. 45:  \"The woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the East, and needs the strongest protection. Of thirty-eight Massachusetts reports, thirty-six state that \"woodcock are decreasing,\" \"rare\" or \"extinct,\" while one states that they are holding their own, and one that they are increasing slightly since the law was passed prohibiting their sale.\"  Let not any honest American or Canadian sportsman lullaby himself into the belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination. As sure as the world, it is _going_! The fact that a little pocket here or there contains a few birds does not in the slightest degree disprove the main fact. If the sportsmen of this country desire to save the seed stock of woodcock, they must give it _everywhere_ five or ten-year close seasons, and _do it immediately_!

We beg you to be so good as to send us two copies in score of the Symphony in A. We likewise wish to know when we may expect a copy of the Sonata for Baroness von Ertmann, as she leaves this, most probably, the day after to-morrow.  No. 3--I mean the enclosed note--is from a musical friend in Silesia, not a rich man, for whom I have frequently had my scores written out. He wishes to have these works of Mozart in his library; as my servant, however, has the good fortune, by the grace of God, to be one of the greatest blockheads in the world (which is saying a good deal), I cannot make use of him for this purpose. Be so kind therefore as to send to Herr ---- (for the _Generalissimus_ can have no dealings with a petty tradesman), and desire him to _write down the price of each work_ and send it to me with my two scores in A, and also an answer to my injunction about Ertmann, as early to-day as you can (_presto, prestissimo_!)--_nota bene_, the _finale_ to be _a march in double-quick time_. I recommend the best execution of these orders, so that no further obstacle may intervene to my recovery.  L. VAN BEETHOVEN,    The best _generalissimus_ for the good,   But the devil himself for the bad!   217.  TO STEINER.  The Lieutenant-General is requested to send his _Diabolum_, that I may tell him myself my opinion of the \"Battle,\" which is _printed in the vilest manner_. There is much to be altered.  THE G----S.   218.  TO TOBIAS HASLINGER.  MY GOOD ADJUTANT,--  Best of all little fellows! Do see again about that house, and get it for me. I am very anxious also to procure _the treatise on education_. It is of some importance to me to be able to compare my own opinions on this subject with those of others, and thus still further improve them. As for our juvenile Adjutant, I think I shall soon have hit on the right system for his education. Your  CONTRA FA,  _Manu propria._   219.  TO THE HIGH-BORN HERR HASLINGER, HONORARY MEMBER OF THE HÖFEN GRABENS AND PATER NOSTER GÄSSCHEN.  BEST OF ALL PRINTERS AND ENGRAVERS,--  Be kinder than kind, and throw off a hundred impressions of the accompanying small plate.[1] I will repay you threefold and fourfold. Farewell!  Your  BEETHOVEN.  [Footnote 1: This is possibly the humorous visiting-card that Beethoven sometimes sent to his friends, with the inscription _Wir bleiben die Alten_ (\"We are the same as ever\"), and on reversing the card, a couple of asses stared them in the face! Frau Eyloff told me of a similar card that her brother Schindler once got from Beethoven on a New Year's day.]   220.  TO BARONESS DOROTHEA VON ERTMANN.[1]  Feb. 23, 1817.  MY DEAR AND VALUED DOROTHEA CECILIA,--  You have no doubt often misjudged me, from my apparently forbidding manner; much of this arose from circumstances, especially in earlier days, when my nature was less understood than at present. You know the manifestations of those self-elected apostles who promote their interests by means very different from those of the true Gospel. I did not wish to be included in that number. Receive now what has been long intended for you,[2] and may it serve as a proof of my admiration of your artistic talent, and likewise of yourself! My not having heard you recently at Cz---- [Czerny's] was owing to indisposition, which at last appears to be giving way to returning health.  I hope soon to hear how you get on at St. Polten [where her husband's regiment was at that time quartered], and whether you still think of your admirer and friend,  L. VAN BEETHOVEN.  My kindest regards to your excellent husband.  [Footnote 1: It was admitted that she played Beethoven's compositions with the most admirable taste and feeling. Mendelssohn thought so in 1830 at Milan, and mentions it in "]]]
