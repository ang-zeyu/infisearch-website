All trade that does not originate from the belligerent country is protected, but not so, if it can be traced so to arise in not too remote a degree.  The same protection however is not extended to the case of a merchant residing in the hostile country, and having a share of a house of trade in an enemy's country. Residence in a neutral country will not protect his share in a house established in the enemy's country, though residence in the enemy's country will condemn his share in a house established in a neutral country.[72]  [Sidenote: Rule of 1756.]  The next mode in which a hostile character may be given to those not naturally bearing it, is by dealing in those branches of commerce which are confined in the time of peace to the subjects of the enemy: _i.e._ the ships and cargoes of a Neutral engaged in the colonial or coasting trade of the enemy (not open to foreigners in time of peace), are liable to the penal consequences of confiscation. This point; was first mooted in the war of 1756, and is called the rule of 1756.[73]         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: National Character of Ships.]  When there is nothing particular or special in the conduct of the vessel itself, the national character is determined by the Residence of the Owner; but there may be circumstances arising from that conduct which will lead to a contrary conclusion. It is a known and established rule with respect to a vessel, that if she is navigating under the pass of a foreign country, she is considered as bearing the national character of the nation under whose pass she sails; she makes a part of its navigation, and is in every respect liable to be considered as a vessel of that country. In like manner, and on similar principles, if a vessel, purchased in the enemy's country, is by constant and habitual occupation continually employed in the trade of that country, commencing with the war, continuing during the war, and evidently on account of the war, that vessel is deemed a ship of the country from which she is so navigating, in the same manner as if she evidently belonged to the inhabitants of it.[74] Further, when parties agree to take the pass and flag of another country, they are not permitted, in case any inconvenience should afterwards arise, to aver against the flag and pass to which they have attached themselves, and to claim the benefit of their real character. They are likewise subject to this further inconvenience, that their own real character may be pleaded against them by others. Such is the state of double disadvantage to which persons expose themselves by assuming the flag and pass of a foreign state.[75]         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidebar: Distinction as to Cargoes]  A distinction is made in England between the Ship and the Cargo. Some countries have gone so far as to make the flag and pass conclusive on the cargo also; but in England it is held that goods have no dependence upon the authority of the state, and may be differently considered. If the cargo is laden in time of peace, though documented as foreign property, in the same manner as the ship, the sailing under a foreign flag and pass has not been held conclusive as to the cargo.[76]         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidebar: Hostile Property cannot be Transferred _in Transitu_.]  Property which has a hostile character at the commencement of a voyage, cannot change that character by assignment while it is _in transitu_, so as to protect it from capture.[77]  In the ordinary course of things, in the time of peace, such a transfer _in transitu_ can certainly be made. When war intervenes, another rule is set up by the Courts of Admiralty, which interferes with the ordinary practice. In a state of war, _existing_ or _imminent_, it is held that the property shall be deemed to continue as it was at the time of shipment, till actual delivery; this arises out of a state of war, which gives a belligerent a right to stop the goods of his enemy. If such a rule did not exist, all goods shipped in an enemy's country would be protected by transfers, which it would be impossible to detect.[78]     CHAPTER II.    SECTION I.    _Actual War_.--_Its Effects_.    [Sidenote: Objects of War.]  Vattel tells us       \"The end of a just war is to _avenge or prevent injury_;      that is to say, to obtain justice by force, when not      obtainable by any other method; to compel an unjust      adversary to repair an injury already done, or to give us      securities against any wrong with which we are threatened by      him. As soon therefore as we have declared war, we have a      right to do against the enemy whatever we find necessary for      the attainment of that end, for the purpose of bringing him      to reason, and obtaining justice and security from him.       \"The lawfulness of the end does not give us any thing      further than barely the means necessary for the attainment      of that end. Whatever we do beyond that, is reprobated by      the law of nature--is faulty and condemnable at the tribunal      of conscience. Hence it is that the right to such acts      varies according to circumstance. What is just and perfectly      innocent in one situation is not always so on other      occasions. Right goes hand in hand with necessity and the      exigency of the case, but never exceeds them.\"  Such are some of the arguments that Vattel puts forth with all the strength of reason and eloquence, against all unnecessary cruelty, and all mean and perfidious warfare.  There was no limit to the career of violence and destruction, justified by some of the earlier writers; they considered a state of war as a dissolution of all moral ties, and a licence for every disorder and fierceness: even such authors as Bynkershoek and Wolff, who lived in the most learned and not the least civilized nations of Europe, and were the contemporaries of that galaxy of talent that adorned the commencement of the eighteenth century, held that every thing done against an enemy was lawful. He might be destroyed, though unarmed, harmless, defenceless; fraud, even poison, might be used against him. A foe was a criminal and an outlaw, who had forfeited his rights, and whose life, liberty, and property, lay at the mercy of the victor.  But such was not the public opinion or practice of enlightened Europe at the time they wrote. Grotius had long before, even in opposition to his own authorities, but influenced by religion and humanity, mentioned that many things were not fit and commendable, though they might be strictly lawful. He held that the Law of Nations prohibited the use of poisoned arms, the employment of assassins, violence to women or the dead, or making slaves of prisoners. Montesquieu followed in the same humane spirit. He writes, that the civilians said,       \"That the law of nations, to prevent prisoners being put to      death, has allowed them to be made slaves.... The reasons of      the civilians are all false. It is false, that killing in      war is lawful, unless in case of absolute necessity; but      when a man has made another his slave, he cannot be said to      be under a necessity of taking away his life, since he      actually did not take it away. War gives no other right over      prisoners than to disable them from doing any further harm,      by securing their persons. All nations concur in detesting      the murdering of prisoners in cold blood.\"[79]  Thus, it is now the established Law of Nations, that necessity is the measure of violence in war, and humanity, its tempering spirit; or, as it has been otherwise enunciated, the rights of war are to be measured by the objects of the war.  Although we have a right to kill our enemies in war; it is only when we find gentler methods insufficient to conquer their resistance and bring them to terms, that we have a right to put them to death.[80]  Under the name of enemies are comprehended not only the first author of the war, but also those who join him and support his cause.  [Sidenote: Cartel]  Out of these enlightened views of war has sprung the System of Cartels for the exchange of prisoners. These exchanges are generally regulated by special convention between the hostile states. Prisoners are sometimes permitted to return home, upon condition not to serve again during the war, or until duly exchanged. Officers are frequently released upon their parole, on the same condition; and to carry more effectually into operation the arrangements necessary for these purposes, commissaries are permitted to reside in the respective hostile states.  Subject to the principle of non-resistance, there are several classes of persons that are generally considered exempt from the operations of war, beyond the effects of unavoidable accident. \"All the members of the enemy's state,\" says Wheaton,       \"may lawfully be treated as enemies, in a Public War; but it      does not follow that all are to be treated alike; though we      may lawfully destroy some of them, it does not follow that      we may lawfully destroy all; for the general rule derived      from the natural law is still the same, that no force      against an enemy is lawful, unless it is necessary to      accomplish the purposes of war. The custom of civilised      nations founded on this principle, has therefore exempted      the persons of the Sovran and his family, the members of the  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],["title","The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#7)"],["body","    Civil Government, women and children, cultivators of the      earth, artizans, labourers, merchants, men of science and      letters, and generally all other public or private persons      engaged in the ordinary civil pursuits of life, from the      direct effect of military operations, unless actually taken      in arms, or guilty of some misconduct in violation of the      usages of war, by which they forfeit their immunity.\"[81]  The same principle of moderation towards that which is non-resisting limits and restrains the operations of war against the territory and other property of the enemy. There is a marked difference in the rights of war carried on by land and at sea, in modification of the general right to seize on _all_ the enemy's property, and to appropriate that property to the captors.  [Sidenote: Objects of a Maritime War.]  The object of a Maritime War is the destruction of the enemy's commerce and navigation, in order to weaken and destroy the foundations of his naval power. The capture or destruction of _private_ property is necessary to that end, and is allowed in maritime wars, by the practice and law of nations.  [Sidenote: Private Property on Land.]  But _private property on land_ is exempt from confiscation, with the exception of such as may become booty in special cases, when taken from enemies in the field or in besieged towns, and of military contributions levied upon the inhabitants of the hostile territory. This exemption extends even to an absolute and unqualified conquest of an enemy's country. In ancient times, both real and personal property of the vanquished passed to the victors; but the last example of confiscation and partition among the conquerors in Europe, was that of England, by William of Normandy.  Unless in special cases, private property on land is not touched, without making compensation; though contributions are sometimes levied in lieu of a necessary confiscation, or for the expenses of maintaining and affording protection. In other respects private rights are unaffected by war.  [Sidenote: Government Property.]  The property, however, belonging to the Government of the vanquished nation, passes to the victorious state, which also takes the place of the former Sovereign, in respect to the eminent domain.[82]  [Sidenote: Limitations of the Right of making War.]  The right of making War, as we have shown in the first chapter of this book, solely belongs to the Sovran power. Subjects cannot, therefore, of themselves, take any step in the affair; nor are they allowed to commit any act of hostility without orders from their Sovran.  The Sovran's order which commands acts of hostility, is either general or particular. The declaration of war, which enjoins the subjects to attack the enemy's subjects, implies a general order. Generals, officers, soldiers, privateersmen, and partisans, being all. commissioned by the Sovran, make war by virtue of a particular order.  In declarations of war, the ancient form is still retained,[83] by which subjects in general are ordered, not only to break off all intercourse with, but also to _attack_ the foe. Custom interprets this general order. It authorises, indeed, and even obliges every subject, of whatever rank, to secure the persons and things belonging to the enemy, when they fall into his hands; but it does not invite the subject to undertake any offensive expedition without a commission or particular order.[84]    SECTION II.    _Prizes and Privateers_.  [Sidenote: Privateer Commissions.]  During the lawless confusion of the feudal ages, the right of making Reprisals was claimed and exercised, with out a Public Commission. It was not until the fifteenth century that Commissions were held necessary, and were issued to private subjects in time of war, and that subjects were forbidden to fit out vessels to cruise against enemies without licence. There were ordinances in Germany, France, Spain, and England, to that effect.[85]  [Sidenote: Non-Commissioned Captors.]  Hostilities, without a Commission, are contrary to usage, and exceedingly irregular and dangerous, but they are not considered as acts of Piracy during the time of war. Noncommissioned vessels of a belligerent nation may at all times capture hostile ships, without being deemed, by the Law of Nations, Pirates. But they have no interest in the prizes they take, and the property so seized is condemned to the Government as _Droits of the Admiralty_. The reward of this class of captors is left to the liberality of the Admiralty, and is often referred to the Admiralty Court.  [Sidenote: Right of Capture.]  The fruits of any forcible detention or occupancy, prior to hostilities, are vested in the crown; similarly, _British_ property taken in course of trade forbidden by the laws of his country, is condemned to the Crown, and not to the individual captor.[86]  To prevent the custom house or excise vessels, that may be commissioned with letters of marque, turning their attention from the smugglers to the more attractive adventure of privateering, all interest in their prizes is reserved to the crown,[87]  [Sidenote: Grants to the Admiralty.]  Though all rights of prize belong originally to the Crown, yet it has been thought expedient to grant a portion of those rights to maintain the dignity of the Lord High Admiral. This grant, (whatever it conveys,) carries with it a total and perpetual alienation of the rights of the crown, and nothing short of an Act of Parliament can restore them; whereas the grant to private captors is nothing more than the mere temporary transfer of a beneficial interest. The rights of the Admiral, as distinguished from those of the Crown, are these; that when vessels come in, not under any motive arising out of the occasions of war, but from distress of weather, or want of provisions, or from ignorance of war, and are seized in port, they belong to the Lord High Admiral; but where the hand of violence has been exercised upon them, where the impression arises from acts connected with war, from revolt of their own crews, or from being forced or driven in by the Queen's ships, they belong to the Crown.  This includes ships and goods already come into the ports, creeks, or roadsteads, of all the Queen's dominions.[88]  [Sidenote: Acquisition of Captures.]  Persons fitting out Private Vessels under a Commission to cruise against the enemy, acquire the property of whatever Captures they may make, as a compensation for their disbursements, and for the risks they run; but they acquire it by grant from the Sovran who issues out the commission to them. The Sovran allows them either the whole, or a part of the capture; this entirely depends on the nature of the contract he has made with them.[89]  This grant of prize is, in terms, a grant of the property of the Queen's enemies, but it is not restricted to the property of the nations with whom we are at war. It is held in construction and practice to embrace all property liable to be condemned as prize, and which is not particularly reserved to the Crown, or the Admiralty.[90]  It depends, also, on the municipal regulations of each particular power: and as a necessary precaution against abuse, the owners of Privateers are required by the ordinances of commercial states to give adequate security that they will conduct the cruize according to the laws and usages of war, and the instructions of the Government; and that they will respect the rights of neutrals, and bring their prizes in for adjudication.  [Sidenote: Commissions of Privateers.]  The Commissions of Privateers do not extend to the capture of private property upon land; that is a right which is not even granted to Queen's ships. The words of the 3rd Section of the Prize Act extend only to capture by any of Her Majesty's ships,       \"of any fortress upon the land, or any arms, ammunition,      stores of war, goods, merchandize, and treasure, belonging      to the state, or to any public trading company, of the      enemies of the crown of Great Britain, upon the land.\"  Thus the interests of the Queen's cruizers are expressly limited with respect to the property in which the captors can acquire any interest of their own, the state still reserving to itself all private property, in order that no temptation may be held out for unauthorized expeditions against the subjects of the enemy on land. With regard to private vessels of war, the Lords of the Admiralty are empowered by the 9th Section, to issue Letters of Marque, to the _Commanders_ of any such ships or vessels,       \"for the attacking and taking any place or fortress upon the      land, or any ship or vessel, arms, ammunition, stores of      war, goods, or merchandize, belonging or possessed by any of      Her Majesty's enemies in any sea, creek, river, or haven.\"  It was the purpose of the persons who brought in this bill, that Privateers should not be allowed to make depredations upon the coasts of the enemy for the purpose of plundering individuals, and for that reason they were restricted to fortified places and fortresses, and to property water-borne.[91]  As Privateers sometimes sail in company with Queen's vessels, and also in small squadrons, for the purpose of mutual assistance, the rights of the privateers vary. When a Privateer is sailing under the convoy of a Queen's ship, she takes no share in any prize taken by the ship, or even by herself, unless she has received orders from the convoying royal ship to give chase, or has acted hostilely against the enemy, actually aiding and assisting in the capture.[92]  When Privateers have sailed in company, it has often happened that not every vessel has been actually engaged in the capture of the prize, though they may have been rendering valuable assistance in a variety of forms, such as watching in the offing, guarding an open outlet of escape to the intended prize. In the disputes arising from these joint captures, Sir William Scott was the "]]]
