The closet is a big one, and you can both hide on the upper shelf. Quick! I'll bring you some supper.\"  All three left the dormitory, and Sam and Tubbs scurried off in the direction indicated. As for Dick, he lost no time in reaching the mess hall.  \"Sorry, sir,\" he said to the under-teacher. \"The bell couldn't have rung very loud.\"  \"It rang as loud as usual,\" was the answer, and no more was said, the teacher's head being just then full of other matters.  Glad to get off so easily, Dick lost no time in eating his supper. While making way with the food he stowed a goodly portion in his pockets, in a couple of spare napkins, and by some silent motions from Tom learned that his brother was doing the same.  Just as the students were finishing the meal, Jasper Grinder came in and walked down the aisles between the tables. He looked both angry and perplexed. As he came close to Tom he paused.  \"Excuse me, Mr. Grinder, but won't you let Sam out of the stone cell?\" asked Tom, to avoid being questioned.  \"You be silent Rover,\" muttered the teacher, and passed on without saying more.  After the supper hour it was usual for the students to have half an hour to themselves, during which they might read, play games, or do as they pleased. But now Mr. Grinder called them together in the main classroom.  \"I wish to talk to you young gentlemen,\" said the teacher, when all were seated.  \"We're going to catch it now,\" whispered Tom to Dick. \"Don't you give the secret away.\"  \"Indeed I won't,\" answered the eldest Rover. \"I intend to lay the whole case before Captain Putnam as soon as he returns.\"  \"Silence!\" thundered Jasper Grinder. \"I want you boys to stop talking instantly.\"  \"I didn't say anything,\" murmured several in an undertone.  \"Silence, I say!\" repeated the master, and then all became so quiet that the ticking of the clock could be heard distinctly.  The teacher gazed around at the scores of faces and looked more stem than ever.  \"I am going to question all of you separately, and I trust each of you will tell the truth. The question is, Do you know what has become of Samuel Rover and William Tubbs? or Do you know what they have done? I shall start with the first boy. Hickley, what have you to say?\"  \"I don't know anything about them,\" answered the boy named Hickley.  \"Brainard, do you know?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Parkham?\"  \"I know they had a little set-to in the gymnasium, but that's all. The whole thing was a friendly bout, I guess.\"  \"I am the best judge of that. It was a disgraceful fight. What have you to say, Griggs?\"  \"If you say it was disgraceful I suppose it was, sir. I thought it was only a friendly dispute----\"  \"Stop! I want you to answer the original questions, yes, or no.\"  \"No.\"  \"No, what?\"  \"No, to both original questions.\"  \"No, sir!\" and Jasper Grinder stamped his foot.  \"Oh! All right, sir. No, sir, to both questions, sir.\"  There was a titter at this, which caused Jasper Grinder to grow red in the face.  \"Boys, be quiet!\" he shouted. \"If you do not be still I will keep all of you in to-morrow.\"  As this would have spoiled the chances for a good skate and some exciting races, the boys immediately subsided. Then the questioning went on until Dick Rover was reached.  \"I don't know where Sam and Tubbs are now,\" said Dick. \"Perhaps they are frozen stiff.\"  \"Did you aid them in escaping from the stone cell and the storeroom?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Have you seen them since I placed them there?\"  \"Yes, I have,\" answered Dick boldly, seeing it was useless to beat about the bush longer.  \"Oh! Then you did aid them to escape?\"  \"Not from the stone cell and the storeroom. I met them after they had escaped.\"  \"Where did you see them last?\"  \"I decline to answer that question.\"  \"Decline!\" thundered Jasper Grinder.  \"I do, sir. As soon as Captain Putnam arrives I shall lay this whole matter before him, and learn if you have any authority for placing my brother in a place where he is liable to catch a cold which may give him pneumonia and be the cause of his death. As it is, my brother suffered a great deal, and so did Tubbs, and if they get sick from it you may be sure that you will be held legally accountable. It was an inhuman thing to do.\"  As Dick finished there was a murmur, and then a number of the students broke out into applause, while Tom clapped his hands as hard as he could. Jasper Grinder stood at his desk dumbstruck, with his face growing paler each instant.  \"Silence! silence!\" he exclaimed, when he could control his voice. \"Silence, I say, or I will cane you all! This is--is most unseemly--it is--er--mutiny! Silence!\"  \"I mean just what I say, Mr. Grinder,\" went on Dick, when he could be heard. \"You are master here, and we are bound to obey you, in certain things. But you shan't keep my brother in an icy room all night, and on a supper of stale bread and cold water. Such treatment would almost make a mule sick.\"  \"Rover, will you be silent, or must I get the cane?\" gasped Jasper Grinder, almost beside himself with rage.  \"If you get your cane, sir, you won't hit me more than once with it.\"  \"Won't I? We'll see who is master here.\"  \"My gracious! Is he really going to try to cane you, Dick!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"I suppose he is,\" was the cool answer. \"He is so angry he doesn't know what he is doing.\"  Rushing from the classroom Jasper Grinder presently reappeared, carrying a cane which looked as if it might hurt a good deal, if vigorously applied.  Tom could not help but grin. Dick was almost as tall as the school-teacher, and probably just as strong, and the idea of a caning appeared ridiculous in the extreme.  Caning was not allowed at Putnam Hall, but evidently Jasper Grinder meant to take matters in his own hands.  \"Richard Rover, come up here,\" he thundered.  \"What for, sir?\"  \"To receive the punishment you so richly deserve.\"  \"Mr. Grinder, you haven't any right to cane me. It's against Captain Putnam's rules.\"  \"I don't care for the rules--I mean, you have acted in such an outrageous manner that I must do whatever I think necessary to uphold law and order.\"  \"I am willing to stand whatever punishment Captain Putnam sees fit to inflict. But I shall not take a caning from you.\"  \"Won't you? We'll see.\"  As Jasper Grinder spoke he leaped from the platform and strode rapidly toward the spot where Dick was standing.  The eldest Rover did not budge, but remained where he was, eying the enraged school-teacher determinedly.  \"Don't you dare to strike!\" he said warningly, as the cane was raised over his head.  \"I will!\" cried Jasper Grinder, and was about to bring the cane down with all force when Tom caught it from behind and wrenched it from his grasp.     CHAPTER VI.  NEWS OF AN OLD ENEMY.   Dick had not intended that the cane should hit him. He was prepared to dodge. But he wanted to make certain that Jasper Grinder would really try to carry out his ill-advised threat.  \"Hi! give me that cane!\" cried the schoolmaster, as he whirled around.  \"I shall not,\" answered Tom, and began to run down one of the aisles to the door.  Instantly Jasper Grinder made after him. But the boys had gathered in a crowd, and it was with difficulty that the man could get through.  As Tom ran for one door Dick ran for another, and it was not long before both met in a hallway leading to the mess hall and the dormitories.  \"Dick, what shall we do next?\" questioned Tom. \"We can't stay here, that's certain.\"  \"We'll get out,\" answered Dick. \"I think Mrs. Stanhope will keep us all night.\"  \"And if she won't, I know the Lanings will,\" said Tom, with a grin.  \"We must let Sam know,\" went on Dick. \"He can go along. I shan't come back until Captain Putnam returns.\"  \"Right you are.\"  Up the stairs they rushed, and into the dormitory where Sam and Tubbs were in hiding.  \"Sam!\" called Dick, and the youngest Rover at once appeared.  \"What's up now? What are you in such a hurry for?\"  \"Get your overcoat and hat, and come on. We are going to the Stanhopes for the night. Here, Tubbs, is some supper,\" and Dick passed over what he had in the napkins, while Tom did the same.  \"Thanks,\" said the rich boy. \"But--but must I stay here alone?\"  \"I don't think we can take you along,\" answered Dick. \"But you want to be careful. Old Grinder is as mad as a hornet. He was going to cane me for helping you two. Come, Sam, there is no time to waste. Tubbs, you had better let Fred Garrison know where you are. He's all right.\"  In a moment more Dick, Tom, and Sam were in their own room and putting on their heavy overcoats and their hats. They lost no time, and as they heard Jasper Grinder coming up one flight of stairs they ran down another pair leading into the kitchen.  Here the servants, directed by Mrs. Green, were putting away what was left of the students' supper.  \"Oh, dear!\" burst out the matron, on catching sight of the boys. \"What do you want here?\"  \"Good-by, Mrs. Green,\" said Dick. \"Tell the captain when he comes that we were driven away from the school by Mr. Grinder, and that we'll return as soon as we learn that he is back.\" And before the housekeeper could answer they opened the kitchen door and ran outside.  It was a dark night and the air was filled with snow, some of which was already sifting lazily downward. But they knew the way well, so the want of light did hot bother them. They crossed the parade ground on a run and made directly for the road leading to the Stanhopes' cottage.  \"I reckon it will be quite a surprise for Mrs. Stanhope and Dora,\" said Tom, after they had told Sam of what had happened in the school-room. \"They won't be looking for us.\"  \"I know they'll treat us well,\" said Dick.  \"To be sure they will--especially after all we did for them on the Lakes,\" put in Sam. \"But let me tell you, I am curious to know how this thing is going to end.\"  \"I think Mr. Grinder will get the worst of it,\" returned Tom confidently. \"He must know he was doing wrong to put you in that icy storeroom and poor Tubbs in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13455"],["title","The Rover Boys In The Mountains; Or, A Hunt for Fun and Fortune (#5)"],["body","cell. How did you make out with Tubbs in the closet?\"  \"Oh, he became quite friendly, and we decided to let the past drop. I promised I wouldn't call him Tubby any more.\"  \"That's fair,\" came from Dick. \"He isn't such a bad sort.\"  On and on hurried the boys. The road was a somewhat lonely one, with several patches of woods to be passed. Several times they halted, endeavoring to ascertain if they were being pursued. But all remained silent. The snow was now coming down more thickly than ever.  \"What a lot of adventures we have had in these woods,\" observed Tom, during one of the halts. \"Don't you remember the tramp who stole the watch, and the rows with Josiah Crabtree and with Arnold Baxter and Dan?\"  \"Indeed I do,\" said Sam. \"Mrs. Stanhope and Dora must be glad to be rid of old Crabtree and Arnold Baxter.\"  \"It's a pity Dan Baxter wasn't locked up with his father,\" said Dick. \"Don't you remember how he used to bother Dora and the Laning girls?\"  \"Do you think he'd bother them now?\" asked Sam. \"If he bothers Grace Laning he had better look out for me.\"  \"That's right, Sam, stand up for your own particular girl----\" began Tom.  \"I didn't say she was my girl,\" cried Sam, and he was glad that the darkness hid his red-growing face. \"I'm no more sweet on her than you are on her sister Nellie.\"  \"It's Dick who must lead off, with Dora Stanhope----\" went on Tom.  \"Oh, stow it, and come on!\" burst in Dick. \"If you keep on talking you'll surely be caught. Grinder may be coming after us in a carriage.\"  \"If we had our bicycles we could get there in no time,\" said Sam.  \"Yes, and we might break our necks in the dark,\" added Dick. \"Come, we haven't more than a mile further to go.\"  On the three trudged, through the snow, which was coming down faster each instant. Once they thought they heard carriage wheels behind them, but soon the sounds faded away in the distance.  At last they came in sight of the Stanhope cottage. A bright light was streaming from the sitting-room windows, and looking in they saw Dora sitting at the table reading a book, and Mrs. Stanhope resting comfortably in an easy-chair in front of the bright-burning fire.  Dora herself came to the door in answer to their ring. \"Why, mamma, it's the Rovers!\" she cried, as she shook hands, \"I never expected to see you to-night, in such a snowstorm. How kind of Captain Putnam to let you come.\"  \"The captain had nothing to do with it,\" answered Dick, as he gave her hand an extra squeeze, which he somehow thought she returned. \"We came because we were having a lot of trouble, and didn't know what else to do.\"  \"More trouble!\" came from Mrs. Stanhope, as she also greeted them. \"I was hoping all our troubles were a thing of the past.\"  \"This isn't any trouble for you,\" answered Dick. \"Excepting that it brings trouble through your giving us shelter for the night.\"  \"If that's the case, then let it bring trouble,\" put in Dora promptly. \"But what is it all about.\"  \"I'll tell you presently, Dora. But in the meantime can you give Sam some supper? He hasn't had a mouthful since dinner time.\"  \"You poor boy!\" came from Mrs. Stanhope. \"To be sure he shall have his supper. I'll tell Mary to prepare it at once,\" and she bustled from the room to give the servant the necessary directions, and returned at once.  Sitting down in front of the fire the three boys told their tale, Mrs. Stanhope and Dora listening with keen attention. When Dick got to the point where Jasper Grinder had wanted to thrash him Dora gave a scream.  \"Oh, Dick, the idea! Why, he really must be crazy!\"  \"I believe his passion got the best of him,\" said the eldest Rover.  \"I'm glad Tom took the cane away,\" went on Dora.  \"It is really too bad,\" observed Mrs. Stanhope, when their story was finished. \"I quite agree with you that Captain Putnam will not uphold Mr. Grinder in his inhuman course. Of course you must stay here to-night, and as long after that as you please.\"  It was not long before supper was ready for Sam, and when he entered the dining room Mrs. Stanhope went along, to see that he got all he desired.  \"I am awfully glad you came,\" said Dora, in a low voice, when she was alone with Dick and Tom. \"I have something important to tell you, something I didn't wish to mention in front of mamma, for it will only worry her without doing any good.\"  \"And what is it?\" asked Tom and Dick, in a breath.  \"I was down to Cedarville yesterday to do some shopping, and I am almost certain that I saw Dan Baxter hanging around the hotel there.\"  \"Dan Baxter!\" ejaculated Dick.  \"Hush, Dick! not so loud. Yes, Dan Baxter. He was on the hotel stoop, but the minute he saw me he went inside.\"  \"Perhaps you are mistaken,\" said Tom. \"I hardly think he'd dare to show himself here.\"  \"At first I was uncertain about it. But when I came back that way I looked again, and I caught him peeping out at me from one of the bar-room windows. As soon as he saw me look he dodged out of sight.\"  \"If Dan Baxter is in this neighborhood, he is here for no good,\" was Dick's blunt comment. \"Evidently he has not forgiven us for helping to put his father back in jail.\"  \"Dan Baxter is not of a forgiving nature, Dick. You must be careful, or he will make trouble for all three of you.\"  \"We can take care of ourselves, Dora. If only he doesn't annoy you and your mother.\"  \"I don't think he'll do that--now Mr. Crabtree is out of it,\" answered Dora, and then, as Mrs. Stanhope re-entered the room, the subject was dropped.     CHAPTER VII.  SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE.   Despite the stirring events which had just passed the Rovers managed to pass a pleasant evening at the Stanhope cottage. This was in a large measure due to Dora, who did all she could to entertain them and make them forget their troubles. All played games, and Dora played the piano and sang for them, while Dick and Tom also took a hand at the singing. Sam could not sing, and declared that he was certainly getting a cold, whether from being in the storeroom or not.  At ten o'clock the boys retired, to a large bed chamber containing a double bed and a good-sized cot. They were soon undressed, and after saying their prayers dropped asleep and slept soundly until seven in the morning.  When they arose a surprise awaited them. On the ground outside the snow lay to the depth of a foot or more, and it was still showing as heavily as ever.  \"Hullo! we are snowed in!\" exclaimed Sam, as he gazed out on the whitened landscape.  \"Sure enough,\" returned Dick, and added:  \"This looks as if Captain Putnam might not come back to-day,\"  \"If that's the case, I vote we stay here,\" put in Tom. \"I'm sure Mrs. Stanhope will keep us.\"  It was found that Sam's cold had attacked him in earnest. He was very hoarse, and complained of a severe pain in the chest.  \"You'll have to do something for that cold,\" said Dick. \"Better stay in bed this morning, and let Mrs. Stanhope put a plaster on your chest.\"  Going below, he told the lady of the cottage of his brother's condition. A mustard draught was at once prepared and placed upon Sam, and he was also given some pine tar cough mixture. These things relieved him somewhat, but Mrs. Stanhope insisted upon it that he remain in bed, and brought him his breakfast with her own hands.  \"Of course you must stay here, especially since Sam is sick,\" said Dora, while they were eating a breakfast of buckwheat cakes, honey, chops, and coffee. \"He may not get worse, but if he does, one of you will have to take the horse and go for the doctor.\"  \"Yes, we'll have to watch Sam,\" answered Dick. \"But don't put yourselves to too much trouble on our account.\"  \"As if we could take too much trouble for you!\" exclaimed Dora, and blushed sweetly. It was not likely that she would ever forget all the Rovers had done for her and her mother.  Tom was anxious to learn about the Lanings, and was told that they were all at home and doing finely.  \"Nellie and Grace are going on a visit to an aunt at Timber Run after the holidays,\" said Dora. \"They wanted me to go along, but I didn't care to leave mamma, and we didn't wish to lock up the house for fear some tramps might break in and rob us.\"  After breakfast Sam said he felt like sitting up, but toward noon his chest began to hurt him again, and Mrs. Stanhope said it would be best that somebody go for a doctor. Dick and Tom both volunteered, but it was finally decided that Dick should go alone, on horseback.  A steed was soon saddled, and off Dick rode, wrapped in his overcoat and with an old fur cap pulled well down over his ears. It had now stopped snowing, so the weather was not quite as unpleasant as it had been.  Dick was bound for the house of Dr. Fremley, a physician he knew well, and thither he made his way as speedily as the horse could plow through the drifts which presented themselves. At times, when the wind arose, it was nipping cold, and the youth was glad to get in where it was warm when the physician's office in Cedarville was reached.  \"Certainly, I will come and see your brother,\" said Dr. Fremley. \"I'll be ready to go in about half an hour.\"  \"Will you go on horseback?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then I'll wait in town and go back with you,\" said Dick. \"I wish to make a purchase or two.\"  It was agreed that the youth should meet the physician at half-past twelve, and leaving his horse in the latter's stable, Dick walked down the main street of Cedarville.  He had his Christmas money with him, and entering a drug store he bought a cup of hot chocolate, that warmed him considerably. After this he selected a bottle of cologne and a box of chocolates as a Christmas gift for Dora.  Opposite to the drug store was a stationery and book store, and here Dick procured a fancy floral calendar for Mrs. Stanhope and an interesting girl's book for Dora.  From the store Dick could obtain a side view of the Cedarville Hotel, which stood on a corner up the street, and having paid for his purchases the youth stood near the door and watched the hotel, wondering"]]]
