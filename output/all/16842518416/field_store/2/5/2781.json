Then shall the good stand in immortal bloom,  In the fair gardens of that second birth; And each bright blossom mingle its perfume  With that of flowers, which never bloomed on earth.  With thy rude ploughshare, Death, turn up the sod,  And spread the furrow for the seed we sow; This is the field and Acre of our God,  This is the place where human harvests grow!    TO THE RIVER CHARLES.  River! that in silence windest  Through the meadows, bright and free, Till at length thy rest thou findest  In the bosom of the sea!  Four long years of mingled feeling,  Half in rest, and half in strife, I have seen thy waters stealing  Onward, like the stream of life.  Thou hast taught me, Silent River!   Many a lesson, deep and long; Thou hast been a generous giver;   I can give thee but a song.  Oft in sadness and in illness,   I have watched thy current glide, Till the beauty of its stillness   Overflowed me, like a tide.  And in better hours and brighter,   When I saw thy waters gleam, I have felt my heart beat lighter,   And leap onward with thy stream.  Not for this alone I love thee,   Nor because thy waves of blue From celestial seas above thee   Take their own celestial hue.  Where yon shadowy woodlands hide thee,   And thy waters disappear, Friends I love have dwelt beside thee,   And have made thy margin dear.  More than this;--thy name reminds me   Of three friends, all true and tried; And that name, like magic, binds me   Closer, closer to thy side.  Friends my soul with joy remembers!   How like quivering flames they start, When I fan the living embers   On the hearth-stone of my heart!  'T is for this, thou Silent River!   That my spirit leans to thee; Thou hast been a generous giver,   Take this idle song from me.     BLIND BARTIMEUS   Blind Bartimeus at the gates Of Jericho in darkness waits; He hears the crowd;—he hears a breath Say, “It is Christ of Nazareth!” And calls, in tones of agony, Ἰησοῦ, ἐλέησόν με!  The thronging multitudes increase; Blind Bartimeus, hold thy peace! But still, above the noisy crowd, The beggar’s cry is shrill and loud; Until they say, “He calleth thee!” Θάρσει ἔγειραι, φωνεῖ δε!  Then saith the Christ, as silent stands The crowd, “What wilt thou at my hands?” And he replies, “O give me light! Rabbi, restore the blind man’s sight.” And Jesus answers, Ὕπαγε Ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέ δε!  Ye that have eyes, yet cannot see, In darkness and in misery, Recall those mighty Voices Three, Ἰησοῦ, ἐλέησόν με! Θάρσει ἔγειραι, ὕπαγε! Ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέ δε!     THE GOBLET OF LIFE   Filled is Life's goblet to the brim; And though my eyes with tears are dim, I see its sparkling bubbles swim, And chant a melancholy hymn    With solemn voice and slow.  No purple flowers,--no garlands green, Conceal the goblet's shade or sheen, Nor maddening draughts of Hippocrene, Like gleams of sunshine, flash between    Thick leaves of mistletoe.  This goblet, wrought with curious art, Is filled with waters, that upstart, When the deep fountains of the heart, By strong convulsions rent apart,    Are running all to waste.  And as it mantling passes round, With fennel is it wreathed and crowned, Whose seed and foliage sun-imbrowned Are in its waters steeped and drowned,    And give a bitter taste.  Above the lowly plants it towers, The fennel, with its yellow flowers, And in an earlier age than ours Was gifted with the wondrous powers,    Lost vision to restore.  It gave new strength, and fearless mood; And gladiators, fierce and rude, Mingled it in their daily food; And he who battled and subdued,    A wreath of fennel wore.  Then in Life's goblet freely press, The leaves that give it bitterness, Nor prize the colored waters less, For in thy darkness and distress    New light and strength they give!  And he who has not learned to know How false its sparkling bubbles show, How bitter are the drops of woe, With which its brim may overflow,    He has not learned to live.  The prayer of Ajax was for light; Through all that dark and desperate fight The blackness of that noonday night He asked but the return of sight,    To see his foeman's face.  Let our unceasing, earnest prayer Be, too, for light,--for strength to bear Our portion of the weight of care, That crushes into dumb despair    One half the human race.  O suffering, sad humanity! O ye afflicted one; who lie Steeped to the lips in misery, Longing, and yet afraid to die,    Patient, though sorely tried!  I pledge you in this cup of grief, Where floats the fennel's bitter leaf! The Battle of our Life is brief The alarm,--the struggle,--the relief,    Then sleep we side by side.    MAIDENHOOD  Maiden! with the meek, brown eyes, In whose orbs a shadow lies Like the dusk in evening skies!  Thou whose locks outshine the sun, Golden tresses, wreathed in one, As the braided streamlets run!  Standing, with reluctant feet, Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet!  Gazing, with a timid glance, On the brooklet's swift advance, On the river's broad expanse!  Deep and still, that gliding stream Beautiful to thee must seem, As the river of a dream.  Then why pause with indecision, When bright angels in thy vision Beckon thee to fields Elysian?  Seest thou shadows sailing by, As the dove, with startled eye, Sees the falcon's shadow fly?  Hearest thou voices on the shore, That our ears perceive no more, Deafened by the cataract's roar?  O, thou child of many prayers! Life hath quicksands,--Life hath snares Care and age come unawares!  Like the swell of some sweet tune, Morning rises into noon, May glides onward into June.  Childhood is the bough, where slumbered Birds and blossoms many-numbered;-- Age, that bough with snows encumbered.  Gather, then, each flower that grows, When the young heart overflows, To embalm that tent of snows.  Bear a lily in thy hand; Gates of brass cannot withstand One touch of that magic wand.  Bear through sorrow, wrong, and ruth, In thy heart the dew of youth, On thy lips the smile of truth!  O, that dew, like balm, shall steal Into wounds that cannot heal, Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;  And that smile, like sunshine, dart Into many a sunless heart, For a smile of God thou art.    EXCELSIOR  The shades of night were falling fast, As through an Alpine village passed A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice, A banner with the strange device,        Excelsior!  His brow was sad; his eye beneath, Flashed like a falchion from its sheath, And like a silver clarion rung The accents of that unknown tongue,        Excelsior!  In happy homes he saw the light Of household fires gleam warm and bright; Above, the spectral glaciers shone, And from his lips escaped a groan,        Excelsior!  \"Try not the Pass!\" the old man said: \"Dark lowers the tempest overhead, The roaring torrent is deep and wide! And loud that clarion voice replied,        Excelsior!  \"Oh stay,\" the maiden said, \"and rest Thy weary head upon this breast!\" A tear stood in his bright blue eye, But still he answered, with a sigh,        Excelsior!  \"Beware the pine-tree's withered branch! Beware the awful avalanche!\" This was the peasant's last Good-night, A voice replied, far up the height,         Excelsior!  At break of day, as heavenward The pious monks of Saint Bernard Uttered the oft-repeated prayer, A voice cried through the startled air,        Excelsior!  A traveller, by the faithful hound, Half-buried in the snow was found, Still grasping in his hand of ice That banner with the strange device,        Excelsior!  There in the twilight cold and gray, Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay, And from the sky, serene and far, A voice fell, like a falling star,        Excelsior!   **************  POEMS ON SLAVERY.  [The following poems, with one exception, were written at sea, in the latter part of October, 1842.  I had not then heard of Dr. Channing's death.  Since that event, the poem addressed to him is no longer appropriate.  I have decided, however, to let it remain as it was written, in testimony of my admiration for a great and good man.]    TO WILLIAM E. CHANNING  The pages of thy book I read,   And as I closed each one, My heart, responding, ever said,   \"Servant of God! well done!\"  Well done!  Thy words are great and bold;   At times they seem to me, Like Luther's, in the days of old,   Half-battles for the free.  Go on, until this land revokes   The old and chartered Lie, The feudal curse, whose whips and yokes   Insult humanity.  A voice is ever at thy side   Speaking in tones of might, Like the prophetic voice, that cried   To John in Patmos, \"Write!\"  Write! and tell out this bloody tale;   Record this dire eclipse, This Day of Wrath, this Endless Wail,   This dread Apocalypse!    THE SLAVE'S DREAM  Beside the ungathered rice he lay,   His sickle in his hand; His breast was bare, his matted hair   Was buried in the sand. Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep,   He saw his Native Land.  Wide through the landscape of his dreams   The lordly Niger flowed; Beneath the palm-trees on the plain   Once more a king he strode; And heard the tinkling caravans   Descend the mountain-road.  He saw once more his dark-eyed queen   Among her children stand; They clasped his neck, they kissed his cheeks,   They held him by the hand!-- A tear burst from the sleeper's lids   And fell into the sand.  And then at furious speed he rode   Along the Niger's bank; His bridle-reins were golden chains,   And, with a martial clank, At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel   Smiting his stallion's flank.  Before him, like a blood-red flag,   The bright flamingoes flew; From morn till night he followed their flight,   O'er plains where the tamarind grew, Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts,   And the ocean rose to view.  At night he heard the lion roar,   And the hyena scream, And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds   Beside some hidden stream; And it passed, like a glorious roll of drums,   Through the triumph of his dream."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1365"],["title","The Complete Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (#7)"],["body","  The forests, with their myriad tongues,   Shouted of liberty; And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud,   With a voice so wild and free, That he started in his sleep and smiled   At their tempestuous glee.  He did not feel the driver's whip,   Nor the burning heat of day; For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep,   And his lifeless body lay A worn-out fetter, that the soul   Had broken and thrown away!    THE GOOD PART  THAT SHALL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY  She dwells by Great Kenhawa's side,   In valleys green and cool; And all her hope and all her pride   Are in the village school.  Her soul, like the transparent air   That robes the hills above, Though not of earth, encircles there   All things with arms of love.  And thus she walks among her girls   With praise and mild rebukes; Subduing e'en rude village churls   By her angelic looks.  She reads to them at eventide   Of One who came to save; To cast the captive's chains aside   And liberate the slave.  And oft the blessed time foretells   When all men shall be free; And musical, as silver bells,   Their falling chains shall be.  And following her beloved Lord,   In decent poverty, She makes her life one sweet record   And deed of charity.  For she was rich, and gave up all   To break the iron bands Of those who waited in her hall,   And labored in her lands.  Long since beyond the Southern Sea   Their outbound sails have sped, While she, in meek humility,   Now earns her daily bread.  It is their prayers, which never cease,   That clothe her with such grace; Their blessing is the light of peace   That shines upon her face.    THE SLAVE IN THE DISMAL SWAMP  In dark fens of the Dismal Swamp   The hunted Negro lay; He saw the fire of the midnight camp, And heard at times a horse's tramp   And a bloodhound's distant bay.  Where will-o'-the-wisps and glow-worms shine,   In bulrush and in brake; Where waving mosses shroud the pine, And the cedar grows, and the poisonous vine   Is spotted like the snake;  Where hardly a human foot could pass,   Or a human heart would dare, On the quaking turf of the green morass He crouched in the rank and tangled grass,   Like a wild beast in his lair.  A poor old slave, infirm and lame;   Great scars deformed his face; On his forehead he bore the brand of shame, And the rags, that hid his mangled frame,   Were the livery of disgrace.  All things above were bright and fair,   All things were glad and free; Lithe squirrels darted here and there, And wild birds filled the echoing air   With songs of Liberty!  On him alone was the doom of pain,   From the morning of his birth; On him alone the curse of Cain Fell, like a flail on the garnered grain,   And struck him to the earth!    THE SLAVE SINGING AT MIDNIGHT  Loud he sang the psalm of David! He, a Negro and enslaved, Sang of Israel's victory, Sang of Zion, bright and free.  In that hour, when night is calmest, Sang he from the Hebrew Psalmist, In a voice so sweet and clear That I could not choose but hear,  Songs of triumph, and ascriptions, Such as reached the swart Egyptians, When upon the Red Sea coast Perished Pharaoh and his host.  And the voice of his devotion Filled my soul with strange emotion; For its tones by turns were glad, Sweetly solemn, wildly sad.  Paul and Silas, in their prison, Sang of Christ, the Lord arisen, And an earthquake's arm of might Broke their dungeon-gates at night.  But, alas! what holy angel Brings the Slave this glad evangel? And what earthquake's arm of might Breaks his dungeon-gates at night?    THE WITNESSES  In Ocean's wide domains,   Half buried in the sands, Lie skeletons in chains,   With shackled feet and hands.  Beyond the fall of dews,   Deeper than plummet lies, Float ships, with all their crews,   No more to sink nor rise.  There the black Slave-ship swims,   Freighted with human forms, Whose fettered, fleshless limbs   Are not the sport of storms.  These are the bones of Slaves;   They gleam from the abyss; They cry, from yawning waves,   \"We are the Witnesses!\"  Within Earth's wide domains   Are markets for men's lives; Their necks are galled with chains,   Their wrists are cramped with gyves.  Dead bodies, that the kite   In deserts makes its prey; Murders, that with affright   Scare school-boys from their play!  All evil thoughts and deeds;   Anger, and lust, and pride; The foulest, rankest weeds,   That choke Life's groaning tide!  These are the woes of Slaves;   They glare from the abyss; They cry, from unknown graves,   \"We are the Witnesses!    THE QUADROON GIRL  The Slaver in the broad lagoon   Lay moored with idle sail; He waited for the rising moon,   And for the evening gale.  Under the shore his boat was tied,   And all her listless crew Watched the gray alligator slide   Into the still bayou.  Odors of orange-flowers, and spice,   Reached them from time to time, Like airs that breathe from Paradise   Upon a world of crime.  The Planter, under his roof of thatch,   Smoked thoughtfully and slow; The Slaver's thumb was on the latch,   He seemed in haste to go.  He said, \"My ship at anchor rides   In yonder broad lagoon; I only wait the evening tides,   And the rising of the moon.  Before them, with her face upraised,   In timid attitude, Like one half curious, half amazed,   A Quadroon maiden stood.  Her eyes were large, and full of light,   Her arms and neck were bare; No garment she wore save a kirtle bright,   And her own long, raven hair.  And on her lips there played a smile   As holy, meek, and faint, As lights in some cathedral aisle   The features of a saint.  \"The soil is barren,--the farm is old\";   The thoughtful planter said; Then looked upon the Slaver's gold,   And then upon the maid.  His heart within him was at strife   With such accursed gains: For he knew whose passions gave her life,   Whose blood ran in her veins.  But the voice of nature was too weak;   He took the glittering gold! Then pale as death grew the maiden's cheek,   Her hands as icy cold.  The Slaver led her from the door,   He led her by the hand, To be his slave and paramour   In a strange and distant land!    THE WARNING  Beware!  The Israelite of old, who tore   The lion in his path,--when, poor and blind, He saw the blessed light of heaven no more,   Shorn of his noble strength and forced to grind In prison, and at last led forth to be A pander to Philistine revelry,--  Upon the pillars of the temple laid   His desperate hands, and in its overthrow Destroyed himself, and with him those who made   A cruel mockery of his sightless woe; The poor, blind Slave, the scoff and jest of all, Expired, and thousands perished in the fall!  There is a poor, blind Samson in this land,   Shorn of his strength and bound in bonds of steel, Who may, in some grim revel, raise his hand,   And shake the pillars of this Commonweal, Till the vast Temple of our liberties. A shapeless mass of wreck and rubbish lies.   *******************  THE SPANISH STUDENT  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  VICTORIAN HYPOLITO                        Students of Alcala.

SCENE I.--The COUNT OF LARA'S chambers.  Night.  The COUNT in his dressing-gown, smoking and conversing with DON CARLOS.    Lara.  You were not at the play tonight, Don Carlos; How happened it?    Don C.  I had engagements elsewhere. Pray who was there?    Lara.  Why all the town and court. The house was crowded; and the busy fans Among the gayly dressed and perfumed ladies Fluttered like butterflies among the flowers. There was the Countess of Medina Celi; The Goblin Lady with her Phantom Lover, Her Lindo Don Diego; Dona Sol, And Dona Serafina, and her cousins.    Don C.  What was the play?    Lara.  It was a dull affair; One of those comedies in which you see, As Lope says, the history of the world Brought down from Genesis to the Day of Judgment. There were three duels fought in the first act, Three gentlemen receiving deadly wounds, Laying their hands upon their hearts, and saying, \"O, I am dead!\" a lover in a closet, An old hidalgo, and a gay Don Juan, A Dona Inez with a black mantilla, Followed at twilight by an unknown lover, Who looks intently where he knows she is not!    Don C.  Of course, the Preciosa danced to-night?    Lara.  And never better.  Every footstep fell As lightly as a sunbeam on the water. I think the girl extremely beautiful.    Don C.  Almost beyond the privilege of woman! I saw her in the Prado yesterday. Her step was royal,--queen-like,--and her face As beautiful as a saint's in Paradise.    Lara.  May not a saint fall from her Paradise, And be no more a saint?    Don C.      Why do you ask?    Lara.  Because I have heard it said this angel fell, And though she is a virgin outwardly, Within she is a sinner; like those panels Of doors and altar-pieces the old monks Painted in convents, with the Virgin Mary On the outside, and on the inside Venus!    Don C.  You do her wrong; indeed, you do her wrong! She is as virtuous as she is fair.    Lara.  How credulous you are!  Why look you, friend, There's not a virtuous woman in Madrid, In this whole city!  And would you persuade me That a mere dancing-girl, who shows herself, Nightly, half naked, on the stage, for money, And with voluptuous motions fires the blood Of inconsiderate youth, is to be held A model for her virtue?    Don C.         You forget She is a Gypsy girl."]]]
