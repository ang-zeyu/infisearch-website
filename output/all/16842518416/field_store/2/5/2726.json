At this moment, wavering between the laws of     Nature and social conventions, she scarcely knows if nakedness     should or should not affright her. A sort of confused atavistic     memory recalls to her a period before clothing was known, and     reveals to her as a paradisaical ideal the customs of that human     epoch.\"      In support of this view the authoress proceeds to point out that     the _décolleté_ constantly reappears in feminine clothing, never     in male; that missionaries experience great difficulty in     persuading women to cover themselves; that, while women accept     with facility an examination by male doctors, men cannot force     themselves to accept examination by a woman doctor, etc. (These     and similar points had already been independently brought forward     by Sergi, _Archivio di Psichiatria_, vol. xiii, 1892.)      It cannot be said that Madame Renooz's arguments will all bear     examination, if only on the ground that nakedness by no means     involves absence of modesty, but the point of view which she     expresses is one which usually fails to gain recognition, though     it probably contains an important element of truth. It is quite     true, as Stendhal said, that modesty is very largely taught; from     the earliest years, a girl child is trained to show a modesty     which she quickly begins really to feel. This fact cannot fail to     strike any one who reads the histories of pseudo-hermaphroditic     persons, really males, who have from infancy been brought up in     the belief that they are girls, and who show, and feel, all the     shrinking reticence and blushing modesty of their supposed sex.     But when the error is discovered, and they are restored to their     proper sex, this is quickly changed, and they exhibit all the     boldness of masculinity. (See e.g., Neugebauer, \"Beobachtungen     aus dem Gebiete des Scheinzwittertumes,\" _Jahrbuch für Sexuelle     Zwischenstufen_, Jahrgang iv, 1902, esp. p. 92.) At the same time     this is only one thread in the tangled skein with which we are     here concerned. The mass of facts which meets us when we turn to     the study of modesty in women cannot be dismissed as a group of     artificially-imposed customs. They gain rather than lose in     importance if we have to realize that the organic sexual demands     of women, calling for coyness in courtship, lead to the temporary     suppression of another feminine instinct of opposite, though     doubtless allied, nature.      But these somewhat conflicting, though not really contradictory,     statements serve to bring out the fact that a woman's modesty is     often an incalculable element. The woman who, under some     circumstances and at some times, is extreme in her reticences,     under other circumstances or at other times, may be extreme in     her abandonment. Not that her modesty is an artificial garment,     which she throws off or on at will. It is organic, but like the     snail's shell, it sometimes forms an impenetrable covering, and     sometimes glides off almost altogether. A man's modesty is more     rigid, with little tendency to deviate toward either extreme.     Thus it is, that, when uninstructed, a man is apt to be impatient     with a woman's reticences, and yet shocked at her abandonments.  The significance of our inquiry becomes greater when we reflect that to the reticences of sexual modesty, in their progression, expansion, and complication, we largely owe, not only the refinement and development of the sexual emotions,--\"_la pudeur_\" as Guyau remarked, \"_a civilisé l'amour_\"--but the subtle and pervading part which the sexual instinct has played in the evolution of all human culture.      \"It is certain that very much of what is best in religion, art,     and life,\" remark Stanley Hall and Allin, \"owes its charm to the     progressively-widening irradiation of sexual feeling. Perhaps the     reluctance of the female first long-circuited the exquisite     sensations connected with sexual organs and acts to the antics of     animal and human courtship, while restraint had the physiological     function of developing the colors, plumes, excessive activity,     and exuberant life of the pairing season. To keep certain parts     of the body covered, irradiated the sense of beauty to eyes,     hair, face, complexion, dress, form, etc., while many savage     dances, costumes and postures are irradiations of the sexual act.     Thus reticence, concealment, and restraint are among the prime     conditions of religion and human culture.\" (Stanley Hall and     Allin, \"The Psychology of Tickling,\" _American Journal of     Psychology_, 1897, p. 31.)      Groos attributes the deepening of the conjugal relation among     birds to the circumstance that the male seeks to overcome the     reticence of the female by the display of his charms and     abilities. \"And in the human world,\" he continues, \"it is the     same; without the modest reserve of the woman that must, in most     cases, be overcome by lovable qualities, the sexual relationship     would with difficulty find a singer who would extol in love the     highest movements of the human soul.\" (Groos, _Spiele der     Menschen_, p. 341.)  I have not, however, been, able to find that the subject of modesty has been treated in any comprehensive way by psychologists. Though valuable facts and suggestions bearing on the sexual emotions, on disgust, the origins of tatooing, on ornament and clothing, have been, brought forward by physiologists, psychologists, and ethnographists, few or no attempts appear to have been made to reach a general synthetic statement of these facts and suggestions. It is true that a great many unreliable, slight, or fragmentary efforts have been made to ascertain the constitution or basis of this emotion.[1] Many psychologists have regarded modesty simply as the result of clothing. This view is overturned by the well-ascertained fact that many races which go absolutely naked possess a highly-developed sense of modesty. These writers have not realized that physiological modesty is earlier in appearance, and more fundamental, than anatomical modesty. A partial contribution to the analysis of modesty has been made by Professor James, who, with his usual insight and lucidity, has set forth certain of its characteristics, especially the element due to \"the application to ourselves of judgments primarily passed upon our mates.\" Guyau, in a very brief discussion of modesty, realized its great significance and touched on most of its chief elements.[2] Westermarck, again, followed by Grosse, has very ably and convincingly set forth certain factors in the origin of ornament and clothing, a subject which many writers imagine to cover the whole field of modesty. More recently Ribot, in his work on the emotions, has vaguely outlined most of the factors of modesty, but has not developed a coherent view of their origins and relationships.      Since the present _Study_ first appeared, Hohenemser, who     considers that my analysis of modesty is unsatisfactory, has made     a notable attempt to define the psychological mechanism of shame.     (\"Versuch einer Analyse der Scham,\" _Archiv für die Gesamte     Psychologie_, Bd. II, Heft 2-3, 1903.) He regards shame as a     general psycho-physical phenomenon, \"a definite tension of the     whole soul,\" with an emotion superadded. \"The state of shame     consists in a certain psychic lameness or inhibition,\" sometimes     accompanied by physical phenomena of paralysis, such as sinking     of the head and inability to meet the eye. It is a special case     of Lipps's psychic stasis or damming up (_psychische Stauung_),     always produced when the psychic activities are at the same time     drawn in two or more different directions. In shame there is     always something present in consciousness which conflicts with     the rest of the personality, and cannot be brought into harmony     with it, which cannot be brought, that is, into moral (not     logical) relationship with it. A young man in love with a girl is     ashamed when told that he is in love, because his reverence for     one whom he regards as a higher being cannot be brought into     relationship with his own lower personality. A child in the same     way feels shame in approaching a big, grown-up person, who seems     a higher sort of being. Sometimes, likewise, we feel shame in     approaching a stranger, for a new person tends to seem higher and     more interesting than ourselves. It is not so in approaching a     new natural phenomenon, because we do not compare it with     ourselves. Another kind of shame is seen when this mental contest     is lower than our personality, and on this account in conflict     with it, as when we are ashamed of sexual thoughts. Sexual ideas     tend to evoke shame, Hohenemser remarks, because they so easily     tend to pass into sexual feelings; when they do not so pass (as     in scientific discussions) they do not evoke shame.      It will be seen that this discussion of modesty is highly     generalized and abstracted; it deals simply with the formal     mechanism of the process. Hohenemser admits that fear is a form     of psychic stasis, and I have sought to show that modesty is a     complexus of fears. We may very well accept the conception of     psychic stasis at the outset. The analysis of modesty has still     to be carried very much further.  The discussion of modesty is complicated by the difficulty, and even impossibility, of excluding closely-allied emotions--shame, shyness, bashfulness, timidity, etc.--all of which, indeed, however defined, adjoin or overlap modesty.[3] It is not, however, impossible to isolate the main body of the emotion of modesty, on account of its special connection, on the whole, with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#4)"],["body","of sex. I here attempt, however imperfectly, to sketch out a fairly-complete analysis of its constitution and to trace its development.      In entering upon this investigation a few facts with regard to     the various manifestations of modesty may be helpful to us. I     have selected these from scattered original sources, and have     sought to bring out the variety and complexity of the problems     with which we are here concerned.      The New Georgians of the Solomon Islands, so low a race that they     are ignorant both of pottery and weaving, and wear only a loin     cloth, \"have the same ideas of what is decent with regard to     certain acts and exposures that we ourselves have;\" so that it is     difficult to observe whether they practice circumcision.     (Somerville, _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1897, p.     394.)      In the New Hebrides \"the closest secrecy is adopted with regard     to the penis, not at all from a sense of decency, but to avoid     Narak, the _sight_ even of that of another man being considered     most dangerous. The natives of this savage island, accordingly,     wrap the penis around with many yards of calico, and other like     materials, winding and folding them until a preposterous bundle     18 inches, or 2 feet long, and 2 inches or more in diameter is     formed, which is then supported upward by means of a belt, in the     extremity decorated with flowering grasses, etc. The testicles     are left naked.\" There is no other body covering. (Somerville,     _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1894, p. 368.)      In the Pelew Islands, says Kubary, as quoted by Bastian, it is     said that when the God Irakaderugel and his wife were creating     man and woman (he forming man and she forming woman), and were at     work on the sexual organs, the god wished to see his consort's     handiwork. She, however, was cross, and persisted in concealing     what she had made. Ever since then women wear an apron of     pandanus-leaves and men go naked. (A. Bastian, _Inselgruppen in     Oceanien_, p. 112.)      In the Pelew Islands, Semper tells us that when approaching a     large water-hole he was surprised to hear an affrighted,     long-drawn cry from his native friends. \"A girl's voice answered     out of the bushes, and my people held us back, for there were     women bathing there who would not allow us to pass. When I     remarked that they were only women, of whom they need not be     afraid, they replied that it was not so, that women had an     unbounded right to punish men who passed them when bathing     without their permission, and could inflict fines or even death.     On this account, the women's bathing place is a safe and favorite     spot for a secret rendezvous. Fortunately a lady's toilet lasts     but a short time in this island.\" (Carl Semper, _Die     Palau-Inseln_, 1873, p. 68.)      Among the Western Tribes of Torres Strait, Haddon states, \"the     men were formerly nude, and the women wore only a leaf petticoat,     but I gather that they were a decent people; now both sexes are     prudish. A man would never go nude before me. The women would     never voluntarily expose their breasts to white men's gaze; this     applies to quite young girls, less so to old women. Amongst     themselves they are, of course, much less particular, but I     believe they are becoming more so.... Formerly, I imagine, there     was no restraint in speech; now there is a great deal of prudery;     for instance, the men were always much ashamed when I asked for     the name of the sexual parts of a woman.\" (A.C. Haddon,     \"Ethnography of the Western Tribes of Torres Straits,\" _Journal     of the Anthropological Institute_, 1890, p. 336.) After a     subsequent expedition to the same region, the author reiterates     his observations as to the \"ridiculously prudish manner\" of the     men, attributable to missionary influence during the past thirty     years, and notes that even the children are affected by it. \"At     Mabuiag, some small children were paddling in the water, and a     boy of about ten years of age reprimanded a little girl of five     or six years because she held up her dress too high.\" (_Reports     of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits_,     vol. v, p. 272.)      \"Although the women of New Guinea,\" Vahness says, \"are very     slightly clothed, they are by no means lacking in a     well-developed sense of decorum. If they notice, for instance,     that any one is paying special attention to their nakedness, they     become ashamed and turn round.\" When a woman had to climb the     fence to enter the wild-pig enclosure, she would never do it in     Vahness's presence. (_Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, Verhdlgen.,     1900, Heft 5, p. 415.)      In Australia \"the feeling of decency is decidedly less prevalent     among males than females;\" the clothed females retire out of     sight to bathe. (Curr, _Australian Race_.)      \"Except for waist-bands, forehead-bands, necklets, and armlets,     and a conventional pubic tassel, shell, or, in the case of the     women, a small apron, the Central Australian native is naked. The     pubic tassel is a diminutive structure, about the size of a     five-shilling piece, made of a few short strands of fur-strings     flattened out into a fan-shape and attached to the pubic hair. As     the string, especially at _corrobboree_ times, is covered with     white kaolin or gypsum, it serves as a decoration rather than a     covering. Among the Arunta and Luritcha the women usually wear     nothing, but further north, a small apron is made and worn.\"     (Baldwin Spencer and Gillen, _Native Tribes of Central     Australia_, p. 572.)      Of the Central Australians Stirling says: \"No sense of shame of     exposure was exhibited by the men on removal of the diminutive     articles worn as conventional coverings; they were taken off     _coram populo_, and bartered without hesitation. On the other     hand, some little persuasion was necessary to allow inspection of     the effect of [urethral] sub-incision, assent being given only     after dismissal to a distance of the women and young children. As     to the women, it was nearly always observed that when in camp     without clothing they, especially the younger ones, exhibited by     their attitude a keen sense of modesty, if, indeed, a     consciousness of their nakedness can be thus considered. When we     desired to take a photograph of a group of young women, they were     very coy at the proposal to remove their scanty garments, and     retired behind a wall to do so; but once in a state of nudity     they made no objection to exposure to the camera.\" (_Report of     the Horn Scientific Expedition_, 1896, vol. iv, p. 37.)      In Northern Queensland \"phallocrypts,\" or \"penis-concealers,\"     only used by the males at _corrobborees_ and other public     rejoicings, are either formed of pearl-shell or opossum-string.     The _koom-pa-ra_, or opossum-string form of phallocrypt, forms a     kind of tassel, and is colored red; it is hung from the     waist-belt in the middle line. In both sexes the privates are     only covered on special public occasions, or when in close     proximity to white settlements. (W. Roth, _Ethnological Studies     among the Northwest-Central-Queensland Aborigines_, 1897, pp.     114-115.)      \"The principle of chastity,\" said Forster, of his experiences in     the South Sea Islands in their unspoilt state, \"we found in many     families exceedingly well understood. I have seen many fine women     who, with a modesty mixed with politeness, refuse the greatest     and most tempting offers made them by our forward youths; often     they excuse themselves with a simple _tirra-tano_, 'I am     married,' and at other times they smiled and declined it with     _epia_, 'no.' ... Virtuous women hear a joke without emotion,     which, amongst us, might put some men to the blush. Neither     austerity and anger, nor joy and ecstasy is the consequence, but     sometimes a modest, dignified, serene smile spreads itself over     their face, and seems gently to rebuke the uncouth jester.\" (J.R.     Forster, _Observations made During a Voyage Round the World_,     1728, p. 392.)      Captain Cook, at Tahiti, in 1769, after performing Divine service     on Sunday, witnessed \"Vespers of a very different kind. A young     man, near six feet high, performed the rites of Venus with a     little girl about eleven or twelve years of age, before several     of our people and a great number of the natives, without the     least sense of its being indecent or improper, but, as it     appeared, in perfect conformity to the custom of the place. Among     the spectators were several women of superior rank, who may     properly be said to have assisted at the ceremony; for they gave     instructions to the girl how to perform her part, which, young as     she was, she did not seem much to stand in need of.\" (J.     Hawkesworth, _Account of the Voyages_, etc., 1775, vol. i, p.     469.)      At Tahiti, according to Cook, it was customary to \"gratify every     appetite and passion before witnesses,\" and it is added, \"in the     conversation of these people, that which is the principal source     of their pleasure is always the principal topic; everything is     mentioned without any restraint or emotion, and in the most     direct terms, by both sexes.\" (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol ii, p.     45.)      \"I have observed,\" Captain Cook wrote, \"that our friends in the     South Seas have not even the idea of indecency, with respect to     any object or any action, but this was by no means the case with     the inhabitants of New Zealand, in whose carriage and     conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with     respect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal,     as are to be found among the politest"]]]
