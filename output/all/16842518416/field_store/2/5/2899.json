La théorie de Legouvé. Legouvé est-il un farceur froid, un Swift, qui a essayé si la France pouvait avaler une nouvelle absurdité? Son choix. Bon, en ce sens que Samson n'est pas un comédien.  De la vraie grandeur des parias.  ------------  Peut-être même, la vertu nuit-elle aux talents des parias.   XLI 74.  Le commerce est, par son essence, _satanique_.  - Le commerce, c'est le prêté-rendu, c'est le prêt avec le sous- entendu: _Rends-moi plus que je ne te donne_. - L'esprit de tout commerçant est complètement vicié. - Le commerce est _naturel_, _donc_ il est _infâme_. - Le moins infâme de tous les commerçants, c'est celui qui dit: Soyons vertueux pour gagner beaucoup plus d'argent que les sots qui sont vicieux. - Pour le commerçant, l'honnêteté elle-même est une spéculation de lucre. - Le commerce est satanique, parce qu'il est une des formes de l'égoïsme, et la plus basse et la plus vile.  75.  Quand Jésus-Christ dit: «Heureux ceux qui sont affamés, car ils seront rassasiés», Jésus-Christ fait un calcul de probabilités.   XLII 76.  Le monde ne marche que par le Malentendu.  - C'est par le Malentendu universel que tout le monde s'accorde. - Car si, par malheur, on se comprenait, on ne pourrait jamais s'accorder.  ------------  L'homme d'esprit, celui qui ne s'accordera jamais avec personne, doit s'appliquer à aimer la conversation des imbéciles et la lecture des mauvais livres. Il en tirera des jouissances amères qui compenseront largement sa fatigue.  77.  Un fonctionnaire quelconque, un ministre, un directeur de théâtre ou de journal, peuvent être quelquefois des êtres estimables, mais ils ne sont jamais divins. Ce sont des personnes sans personnalité, des êtres sans originalité, nés pour la fonction, c'est-à-dire pour la domesticité publique.   XLIII 78.  Dieu et sa profondeur.  On peut ne pas manquer d'esprit et chercher dans Dieu le complice et l'ami qui manquent toujours. Dieu est l'éternel confident dans cette tragédie dont chacun est le héros. Il y a peut-être des usuriers et des assassins qui disent à Dieu: «Seigneur, faites que ma prochaine opération réussisse!» Mais la prière de ces vilaines gens ne gâte pas l'honneur et le plaisir de la mienne.  79.  Toute idée est, par elle-même, douée d'une vie immortelle, comme une personne.  Toute forme créée, même par l'homme, est immortelle. Car la forme est indépendante de la matière, et ce ne sont pas les molécules qui constituent la forme.  ------------  Anecdotes relatives à Émile Douay et à Constantin Guys, détruisant ou plutôt croyant détruire leurs oeuvres.   XLIV 80.  Il est impossible de parcourir une gazette quelconque, de n'importe quel jour ou quel mois ou quelle année, sans y trouver à chaque ligne les signes de la perversité humaine la plus épouvantable, en même temps que les _vanteries_ les plus surprenantes de probité, de bonté, de charité, et les affirmations les plus effrontées relatives au progrès et à la civilisation.  Tout journal, de la première ligne à la dernière, n'est qu'un tissu d'horreurs. Guerres, crimes, vols, impudicités, tortures, crimes des princes, crimes des nations, crimes des particuliers, une ivresse d'atrocité universelle.  Et c'est de ce dégoûtant apéritif que l'homme civilisé accompagne son repas de chaque matin. Tout, en ce monde, sue le crime: le journal, la muraille et le visage de l'homme.  Je ne comprends pas qu'une main puisse toucher un journal sans une convulsion de dégoût.   XLV 81.  La force de l'amulette démontrée par la philosophie. Les sols percés, les talismans, les souvenirs de chacun.  Traité de Dynamique morale. De la vertu des sacrements.  Dès mon enfance, tendance à la mysticité. Mes conversations avec Dieu.  82.  De l'Obsession, de la Possession, de la prière et de la Foi.  Dynamique morale de Jésus.  (Renan trouve ridicule que Jésus croie à la toute-puissance, même matérielle, de la Prière et de la Foi).  Les sacrements sont les moyens de cette Dynamique.  ------------  De l'infamie de l'imprimerie, grand obstacle au développement du Beau.  ------------  Belle conspiration à organiser pour l'extermination de la Race Juive.  Les Juifs, _Bibliothécaires_ et témoins de la _Rédemption_.   XLVI 83.  Tous les imbéciles de la Bourgeoisie qui prononcent sans cesse les mots: «immoral, immoralité, moralité dans l'art» et autres bêtises me font penser à Louise Villedieu, putain à cinq francs, qui m'accompagnant une fois au Louvre, où elle n'était jamais allée, se mit à rougir, à se couvrir le visage, et me tirant à chaque instant par la manche, me demandait, devant les statues et les tableaux immortels, comment on pouvait étaler publiquement de pareilles indécences.  ------------  Les feuilles de vigne du sieur Nieuwerkerke.   XLVII 84.  Pour que la loi du progrès existât, il faudrait que chacun voulût la créer; c'est-à-dire que quand tous les individus s'appliqueront à progresser, alors, et seulement alors, l'humanité sera en progrès.  Cette hypothèse peut servir à expliquer l'identité des deux idées contradictoires, liberté et fatalité. - Non seulement il y aura, dans le cas de progrès, identité entre la liberté et la fatalité, mais cette identité a toujours existé. Cette identité c'est l'_histoire_, histoire des nations et des individus.   XLVIII 85.  Sonnet à citer dans _Mon coeur mis à nu_.  Citer également la pièce sur _Roland_.  _Je songeais cette nuit que Philis revenue,_ _Belle comme elle était à la clarté du jour,_ _Voulait que son fantôme encore fît l'amour,_ _Et que, comme Ixion, j'embrassasse une nue._  _Son ombre dans mon lit se glisse toute nue,_ _Et me dit: «Cher Damon, me voici de retour;_ _Je n'ai fait qu'embellir en ce triste séjour_ _Où depuis mon départ le Sort m'a retenue._  _»Je viens pour rebaiser le plus beau des amants;_ _Je viens pour remourir dans tes embrassements!»_ _Alors, quand cette idole eut abusé ma flamme,_  _Elle me dit: «Adieu! Je m'en vais chez les morts._ _Comme tu t'es vanté d'avoir foutu mon corps,_ _Tu pourras te vanter d'avoir foutu mon âme.»_  Parnasse satyrique.  Je crois que ce sonnet est de Maynard.

Conclusion     MAKING HIS WAY   CHAPTER I  TWO SCHOOL FRIENDS   Two boys were walking in the campus of the Bridgeville Academy. They were apparently of about the same age--somewhere from fifteen to sixteen--but there was a considerable difference in their attire.  Herbert Grant was neatly but coarsely dressed, and his shoes were of cowhide, but his face indicated a frank, sincere nature, and was expressive of intelligence.  His companion was dressed in a suit of fine cloth, his linen was of the finest, his shoes were calfskin, and he had the indefinable air of a boy who had been reared in luxury.  He had not the broad, open face of his friend--for the two boys were close friends--but his features were finely chiseled, indicating a share of pride, and a bold, self-reliant nature.  He, too, was an attractive boy, and in spite of his pride possessed a warm, affectionate heart and sterling qualities, likely to endear him to those who could read and understand him.  His name was Frank Courtney, and he is the hero of my story.  \"Have you written your Latin exercises, Frank?\" asked Herbert.  \"Yes; I finished them an hour ago.\"  \"I was going to ask you to write them with me. It is pleasanter to study in company.\"  \"Provided you have the right sort of company,\" rejoined Frank.  \"Am I the right sort of company?\" inquired Herbert, with a smile.  \"You hardly need to ask that, Herbert. Are we not always together? If I did not like your company, I should not seek it so persistently. I don't care to boast, but I have plenty of offers of companionship which I don't care to accept. There is Bob Stickney, for instance, who is always inviting me to his room; but you know what he is--a lazy fellow, who cares more to have a good time than to study. Then there is James Cameron, a conceited, empty-headed fellow, who is very disagreeable to me.\"  \"You don't mention your stepbrother, Mark Manning.\"  \"For two reasons--he doesn't care for my company, and of all the boys I dislike him the most.\"  \"I don't like him myself. But why do you dislike him so much?\"  \"Because he is a sneak--a crafty, deceitful fellow, always scheming for his own interest. He hates me, but he doesn't dare to show it. His father is my mother's husband, but the property is hers, and will be mine. He thinks he may some day be dependent on me, and he conceals his dislike in order to stand the better chance by and by. Heaven grant that it may be long before my dear mother is called away!\"  \"How did she happen to marry again, Frank?\"  \"I can hardly tell. It was a great grief to me. Mr. Manning was a penniless lawyer, who ingratiated himself with my mother, and persecuted her till she consented to marry him. He is very soft-spoken, and very plausible, and he managed to make mother--who has been an invalid for years--think that it would be the best thing for her to delegate her cares to him, and provide me with a second father.\"  Frank did not like his stepfather, he did not trust him.  \"Your stepbrother, Mark Manning, enjoys the same advantages as yourself, does he not?\" inquired Herbert.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then his father's marriage proved a good thing for him.\"  \"That is true. When he first came to the house he was poorly dressed, and had evidently been used to living in a poor way. He was at once provided with a complete outfit as good as my own, and from that time as much has been spent on him as on me. Don't think that I am mean enough to grudge him any part of the money expended upon him. If he were like you, I could like him, and enjoy his society; but he is just another as his father.\"  Here Herbert's attention was drawn to a boy who was approaching with a yellow envelope in his hand.  \"Frank,\" he said, suddenly, \"there's Mark Manning. He looks as if he had something to say to you. He has either a letter or a telegram in his hand.\"     CHAPTER II  THE TELEGRAM   Frank's heart gave a great bound at the suggestion of a telegram. A telegram could mean but one thing--that his mother had become suddenly worse.  He hurried to meet his stepbrother.  \"Is that a telegram, Mark?\" he asked, anxiously.  \"Yes.\"  \"Is it anything about mother? Tell me quick!\"  \"Read it for yourself, Frank.\"  Frank drew the telegram from the envelope, and read it hastily:  \"My wife is very sick. I wish you and Frank to come home at once.\"  \"When does the next train start, Herbert?\" asked Frank, pale with apprehension.  \"In an hour.\"  \"I shall go by that train.\"  \"I don't think I can get ready so soon,\" said Mark, deliberately.  \"Then you can come by yourself,\" replied Frank, impetuously. \"I beg your pardon, Mark,\" he added. \"I cannot expect you to feel as I do. It is not your mother.\"  \"It is my stepmother,\" said Mark.  \"That is quite different. But I must not linger here. I will go at once to Dr. Brush, and tell him of my summons home. Good-bye, Herbert, till we meet again.\"  \"I will go with you to the depot, Frank,\" said his friend, sympathizingly. \"Don't wait for me. Go ahead, and make your preparation for the journey. I will be at your room in a quarter of an hour.\"  \"You won't go by the next train, Mark?\" said Herbert.  \"No. I don't care to rush about as Frank is doing.\"  \"You would if it were your own mother who was so ill.\"  \"I am not sure. It wouldn't do any good, would it?\"  \"You would naturally feel anxious,\" said Herbert.  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so!\" answered Mark, indifferently.  Mark Manning was slender and dark, with a soft voice and rather effeminate ways. He didn't care for the rough sports in which most boys delight; never played baseball or took part in athletic exercises, but liked to walk about, sprucely dressed, and had even been seen on the campus on a Saturday afternoon with his hands incased in kid gloves.  For this, however, he was so ridiculed and laughed at that he had to draw them off and replace them in his pocket.  As Frank and Herbert walked together to the railway station, the latter said:  \"It seems to me, Frank, that the telegram should have been sent to you, rather than to Mark Manning. You are the one who is most interested in the contents.\"  \"I thought of that, Herbert, but I was too much affected by the contents to speak of it. I am not surprised, however. It is like Mr. Manning. It jarred upon me to have him speak of mother as his wife. She is so, but I never could reconcile myself to the fact.\"  \"Do you remember your father--your own father, Frank?\"  \"You need not have said 'your own father.' I don't recognize Mr. Manning as a father, at all. Yes, I remember him. I was eight years old when he died. He was a fine-looking man, always kind--a man to be loved and respected. There was not a particle of similarity between him and Mr. Manning. He was strong and manly.\"  \"How did it happen that he died so young?\"  \"He was the victim of a railway accident. He had gone to New York on business, and was expected back on a certain day. The train on which he was a passenger collided with a freight train, and my poor father was among the passengers who were killed. The news was almost too much for my poor mother, although she had not yet become an invalid. It brought on a fit of sickness lasting for three months. She has never been altogether well since.\"  \"After all, Frank, the gifts of fortune, or rather Providence, are not so unequally distributed as at first appears. You are rich, but fatherless. I am poor enough but my father and mother are both spared to me.\"  \"I would gladly accept poverty if my father could be restored to life, and my mother be spared to me for twenty years to come.\"  \"I am sure you would, Frank,\" said Herbert. \"Money is valuable, but there are some things far more so.\"  They had reached the station by this time, and it was nearly the time for the train to start. Frank bought his ticket, and the two friends shook hands and bade each other good-bye.  In an hour Frank was walking up the long avenue leading to the front door of the mansion.  The door was opened by his stepfather.  \"How is mother?\" asked Frank, anxiously.  \"I am grieved to say that she is very sick,\" said Mr. Manning, in a soft voice. \"She had a copious hemorrhage this morning, which has weakened her very much.\"  \"Is she in danger?\" asked Frank, anxiously.  \"I fear she is,\" said Mr. Manning.  \"I suppose I can see her?\"  \"Yes; but it will be better not to make her talk much.\"  \"I will be careful, sir.\"  Frank waited no longer, but hurried to his mother's chamber. As he entered, and his glance fell on the bed and its occupant, he was"]]]
