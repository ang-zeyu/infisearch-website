Make tomato sauce as follows: Chop the eschalots up very finely, slice the tomatoes and stew both in 3/4 pint of water for 20 minutes, adding seasoning and the butter; thicken the sauce with the wheatmeal, rub through a sieve, pour it over the artichokes and stew both gently until the artichokes are quite tender; serve with potatoes.   BEAN PIE.  This is made from boiled beans, which are put in a pie-dish, soaked tapioca, flavouring herbs, pepper, salt, and butter are added, a cup of water is poured in to make the gravy, a crust is put on the top, and then baked for 1 hour or so. This is a tasty dish. Cold beans are very nice if warmed in a frying-pan with oil or butter, and may be eaten with potatoes, vegetables, and sauce. Mashed beans, flavoured with pepper, salt, and mace, and put into pots make an excellent substitute for potted meat.   BREAD AND CHEESE SAVOURY.  1/2 lb. of Allinson wholemeal bread, 3 oz. of grated cheese, 1 pint of milk, 3 eggs, pepper and salt to taste, a little nutmeg, and some butter. Cut the bread into slices and butter them: arrange in layers in a pie-dish, spreading some cheese between the layers, and dusting with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Finish with a good sprinkling of cheese. Whip up the eggs, mix them with the milk and pour the mixture over the bread and cheese in the pie-dish. Pour the custard back into the basin, and repeat the pouring over the contents of the pie-dish. If this is done 2 or 3 times the top slices of bread and butter get soaked and then bake better. This should also be done when a bread and butter pudding is made. Bake the savoury until brown, which it will be in about 3/4 of an hour.   BUTTER BEANS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.  Pick the beans, wash them, and steep them over night in boiling water, just covering them. Allow 2 or 3 oz. of beans for each person. In the morning, let them cook gently in the water they are steeped in with the addition of a little butter, until quite soft, which will be in about 2 hours. The beans should be cooked in only enough water to keep them from burning, therefore, when it boils away, add only just sufficient for absorption. The sauce is made thus: 1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, a handful of finely chopped parsley, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Boil the milk and thicken it with the flour, which should first be smoothed with a little cold milk, then last of all add the lemon juice, the seasoning, and the parsley. This dish should be eaten with potatoes and green vegetables.   CARROTS AND RICE.  1 breakfastcupful of rice, 6 medium-sized carrots, 2 oz. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped Parsley, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, pepper and salt to taste.

Cut up the cauliflower and potatoes, sprinkle half the cheese between the vegetables, make a batter of the milk and eggs and meal, add seasoning to it, place the vegetables in a pie-dish, pour the batter over them, cut the butter into little bits and put them on the top of the pie, sprinkle the rest of the cheese over all, and bake for 1 hour.

CELERY Ã€ LA PARMESAN.  2 heads of celery, 1 pint of milk, 2 oz. of Parmesan, or any other cooking cheese, 2 tablespoonfuls of breadcrumbs, 1 oz. of butter.

Boil the chestnuts until partly tender, and remove the skins; cut the celery into pieces, removing the outer very hard pieces only, slice the onion and stew until tender in 1 pint of water; mix all the ingredients together, adding 1 oz. of the butter and seasoning to taste; make some pastry of the meal, 3 oz. of butter, and a little cold water; turn the vegetables into a pie-dish, cover the dish with the pastry, and bake the pie for 1 hour; serve with brown gravy.

Those who do not like tomatoes can leave them out, and the dish will still be very savoury. The potatoes should be peeled, washed, and cut into thin slices, and the onions peeled and cut into thin slices. Arrange the vegetables and tomatoes in layers; dust a little pepper and salt between the layers, and finish with a layer of potatoes. Cut the butter into little bits, place them on the top of the potatoes, fill the dish with hot water, and bake the hot-pot for 2 hours or more in a hot oven. Add a little more hot water if necessary while baking to make up for what is lost in the cooking.   LEEK PIE.  1 bunch of leeks, 1 lb. of potatoes, 1/2 teaspoonful of herbs, a little nutmeg, 1 pint of milk, pepper and salt to taste, 8 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3 eggs, 1 oz. of butter.

Scald and slice the tomatoes, and mix the fried vegetables, lentils, tomatoes, herbs, and seasoning well together. Turn the mixture into a pie-dish, and pour over as much water or vegetable stock as may be required for gravy. Quarter the eggs and place them on the top. Cover with a short crust, and bake the pie for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.   LENTIL RISSOLES.  1/2 lb. of lentils, 1 finely chopped onion, 1 breakfastcupful of breadcrumbs, 1 breakfastcupful of tinned tomatoes, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, pepper and salt to taste, some raspings, butter, vege-butter or oil for frying. Pick and wash the lentils, and boil them in enough water to cover them; when this is absorbed add the tomatoes, and if necessary gradually a little more water to prevent the lentils from burning. Fry the onion in 1-1/2 oz. of butter, mix it with the lentils as they are stewing, and add pepper and salt to taste. When the lentils are quite soft, and like a pureÃ© (which will take from 1 to 1-1/2 hours), set them aside to cool. Mix the lentils and the breadcrumbs, beat up one of the eggs and add it to the mixture, beating all well together. If it is too dry, add a very little milk, but only just enough to make the mixture keep together. Form into rissoles, beat up the second egg, roll them into the egg and raspings, and fry the rissoles a nice brown in boiling butter or oil. Drain and serve.

Let it cool, and meanwhile make a paste of 6 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal and 2 oz. of butter or vege-butter and a little water. Roll the paste out thin, cut into squares of about 4 inches. Place some of the lentil mixture in each, moisten the edges, turn half over, and press the edges together. Bake for 15 minutes in a floured tin, and serve with brown sauce, vegetables, and potatoes.

When tender set them aside to cool a little. Scald and skin the tomatoes, cut them into slices and place them in a buttered pie-dish. Smooth the curry with 1 spoonful of water; add the curry, the eggs, and salt to the cooked rice and lentils, and mix all well.

Chop fine the onion and fry it a nice brown in the butter; add the fried onions and tomatoes to the lentils, stir them sometimes to prevent burning, and let the lentils cook gently until they have become soft and make a fairly firm purÃ©e. If too dry, add a little more water as may be required. When they are done remove the mace and turn the lentils out to get cold. Then use for making sandwiches with very thin bread and butter.   MINESTRA.  1 breakfastcupful of potatoes cut into small dice, 2 breakfastcupfuls of flagolet beans, onions, carrots, and celery mixed (the latter cut up small), 1/4 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, pepper and salt to taste.
