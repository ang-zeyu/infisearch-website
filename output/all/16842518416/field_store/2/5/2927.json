It was not six weeks since at Neuve Chapelle the Canadians had for the first time, while not called on to take much active part themselves, seen the realities of European battle; and the cheers of the British troops at Ypres as the exhausted Dominion troops came back from the trenches will live in history.  Messines, and the victory of June, 1917--Passchendaele, and the losses of that grim winter--all the points indeed of this dim horizon from north-west to south-east have their imperishable meaning for Great Britain and the Dominions. For quite apart from the main actions which stand out, fighting and death never ceased in the Ypres salient.  Then, as the great Army of the gallant dead seemed to gather round one on this famous road, and over these shell-torn flats, a sudden recollection of a letter which I received in August, 1918, brought a tightening of the throat. A Canadian lady, writing from an American camp in the east of France, appealed to myself and other writers to do something to bring home to the popular mind of America a truer knowledge of what the British Armies had done in the war. \"I see here,\" says the writer, \"hundreds of the finest remaining white men on earth every week. They are wonderful military material, and very attractive and lovable boys. But it discourages all one's hope for the future unity and friendship between us all to realise as I have done the last few months that the majority of these men are entering the fight, firmly believing that 'England has not done her share--that France had done it all--the Colonials have done all the hard fighting, etc.'\" And she proceeds to attribute the state of things to the \"belittling reports\" of England's share in the war given in the newspapers which reach these \"splendid men\" from home.  A similar statement has come to me within the last few days, in another letter from an English lady in an American camp near Verdun, who speaks of the tragic ignorance--for tragic it is when one thinks of all that depends on Anglo-American understanding in the future!--shown by the young Americans in the camp where she is at work, of the share of Great Britain in the war.  Alack! How can we bring our two nations closer together in this vital matter? Of course there is no belittlement of the British part in the war among those Americans who have been brought into any close contact with it. And in my small efforts to meet the state of things described in the letters I have quoted, some of the warmest and most practical sympathy shown has come from Americans. But in the vast population of the United States with its mixed elements, some of them inevitably hostile to this country, how easy for the currents of information and opinion to go astray over large tracts of country at any rate, and at the suggestion of an anti-British press!  The only effective remedy, it seems to me, would be the remedy of eyes and ears! Would it not be well, before the whole of the great American Army goes home, that as many as possible of those still in France--groups, say, of non-commissioned officers from various American divisions, representing both the older and the newer levies, and drawn from different local areas--should be given the opportunity of seeing and studying the older scenes of the war on the British front?--and that our own men, also, should be able to see for themselves, not only the scenes of the American fighting of last year, but the vast preparations of all kinds that America was building up in France for the further war that might have been; preparations which, as no one doubts, changed the whole atmosphere of the struggle?  \"_England has not done her share!_\"  How many thousands of British dead--men from every county in England and Scotland, from loyal Ireland, from every British dominion and colony--lie within the circuit of these blood-stained hills of Ypres? How many more in the Somme graveyards?--round Lens and Arras and Vimy?--about Bourlon Wood and Cambrai?--or in the final track of our victorious Armies breaking through the Hindenburg line on their way to Mons? Gloriously indeed have the Dominions played their part in this war; but of all the casualties suffered by the Armies of the Empire, 80 _per cent_ of them fell on the population of these islands. America was in the great struggle for a year and a half, and in the real fightingline for about six months. She has lost some 54,000 of her gallant sons; and we sorrow for them with her.  But through four long years scarcely a family in Great Britain and the Dominions that possessed men on the fighting fronts--and none were finally exempt except on medical or industrial grounds--but was either in mourning for, or in constant fear of death for one or more of its male members, whether by bullet, shell-fire or bomb, or must witness the return to them of husbands, brothers, and sons, more or less injured for life. The total American casualties are 264,000. The total British casualties--among them from 700,000 to 800,000 dead--are 2,228,000 out of a total white population for the Empire of not much more than two-thirds of the population of the United States. There is small room for \"belittling\" here. A silent clasp of the hands between our two nations would seem to be the natural gesture in face of such facts as these.     II.   Such thoughts, however, belong to the emotional or tragic elements in the British war-consciousness. Let me turn to others of a different kind--the intellectual and reflective elements--and the changing estimates which they bring about.  Take for instance what we have been accustomed to call the \"March retreat\" of last year. The dispatch of Sir Douglas Haig describing the actions of March and April last year was so headed in the _Times_, though nothing of the kind appears in the official publication. And we can all remember in England the gnawing anxiety of every day and every hour from March 21st up to the end of April, when the German offensive had beaten itself out, on the British front at least, and the rushing over of the British reinforcements, together with the rapid incoming of the Americans, had given the British Army the breathing space of which three months later it made the use we know.  \"But why,\" asks one of the men best qualified to speak in our Army--\"why use the words 'retreat' and 'disaster' at all?\" They were indeed commonly used at the time both in England and abroad, and have been often used since about the fighting of the British Army last March and April. Strictly speaking, my interlocutor suggests, neither word is applicable. The British Army indeed fell back some thirty-five miles on its southern front, till the German attack was finally stayed before Amiens. The British centre stood firm from Arras to BÃ©thune. But in the north we had to yield almost all the ground gained in the Salient the year before, and some that had never yet been in German hands. We lost heavily in men and guns, and a shudder of alarm ran through all the Allied countries.  Nevertheless what Europe was then witnessing--I am of course quoting not any opinion of my own, to which I have no right, but what I have gathered from those responsible men who were in the forefront of the fighting--was in truth _a great defensive battle_, long and anxiously foreseen, in which the German forces were double the British forces opposed to them (64 to 32 divisions--73 to 32--and so on), while none the less all that was vitally necessary to the Allied cause was finally achieved by the British Army, against these huge odds. Germany, in fact, made her last desperate effort a year ago to break through the beleaguering British, forces, and failed. On our side there was no real surprise, though our withdrawal was deeper and our losses greater than had been foreseen. The troops themselves may have been confident; it is the habit of gallant men. But the British command knew well what it had to face, and had considered carefully weeks beforehand where ground could be given--as in all probability it would have to be given--with the least disadvantage. Some accidents, if one may call them so, indeed there were--the thick white fog, for instance, which \"on the morning of March 21st enveloped our outpost line, and made it impossible to see more than fifty yards in any direction, so that the machine guns and forward field-guns which had been disposed so as to cover this zone with their fire were robbed almost entirely of their effect--and the masses of German infantry advanced comparatively unharassed, so closely supporting each other that loss of direction was impossible.\" Hence the rapidity of the German advance through the front lines on March 21st, and the alarming break-through south of St. Quentin, where our recently extended line was weakest and newest. A second accident was the drying up of the Oise Marshes at a time when in a normal year they might have been reckoned on to stop the enemy's advance. A third piece of ill-luck was the fact that in the newest section of the British line, where the enemy attack broke at its hottest, there had been no time, since it had been given over to us by the French--who had held it lightly, as a quiet sector, during the winter--to strengthen its defences, and to do the endless digging, the railway construction, and the repair of roads, which might have made a very great difference. And, finally, there was the most dangerous accident of all--the break through of the Portuguese line at Richebourg St. Vaast, just as the tired division holding it was about to be relieved. Of that accident, as we all remember, the enemy, hungry for the Channel ports, made his very worst and most; till the French and British fought him to a final stand before Hazebrouck and Ypres.  [Illustration: _British Official Photograph_ The St. Quentin Canal which was crossed by the 46th in life-belts.]  Meanwhile, the strategic insight of Marshal Foch, who assumed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13827"],["title","Fields of Victory (#6)"],["body","control of the Allied Armies in France and Belgium on March 26th, combined with the experienced and cool-headed leadership of the British Commander-in-Chief, refused to dissipate the French reserves, so important to the future course of the war, in any small or piecemeal reinforcement of the British lines. The risks of the great moment had to be taken, and both the French and British Commanders had complete faith in the capacity of the British Army to meet them. And when all is said, when our grave losses in casualties, prisoners, and guns are fully admitted, what was the general result? The Germans had failed to gain either of their real objectives:--either the Channel ports, or the division of the British Armies from the French. They wore themselves out against a line which recoiled indeed but never broke, and was all the time filling up and strengthening from behind. The losses inflicted on their immense reserves reacted on all the subsequent fighting of the year, both on the Aisne and the Marne. And when the British Armies had brought the huge attack to a standstill--which for the centre and south of our line had been already attained ten days after the storm broke--and knew the worst that had happened or could happen to them; when the Australians had recaptured Villers-Bretonneux; when the weeks passed and the offensive ceased; when all gaps in our ranks were filled by the rush of reinforcements from home, and the American Army poured steadily across the Atlantic, the tension and peril of the spring passed steadily into the confident strength and--expectation of the summer. The British Army had held against an attack which could never be repeated, and the future was with the Allies.  Let us remember that at no time in our fighting withdrawal, either on the Somme or on the Lys, was there \"anything approaching a break-down of command, or a failure in morale.\" So the Field Marshal. On the other hand, all over the vast battle-field--in every part of the hard \"waiting game\" which for a time the British Armies were called to play, men did the most impossible and heroic things. Gun detachments held their posts till every man was killed or wounded; infantry who had neither rest nor sleep for days together, fought \"back to back in the trenches, shooting both to front and rear.\" Occasional confusion, even local panic, occasional loss of communication and misunderstanding of orders, occasional incompetence and stupidity there must be in such a vast backward sweep of battle, but skill, purpose, superb bravery were never lacking in any portion of the field; and the German _communiquÃ©s_ exultantly announcing the \"total defeat of the British Armies\" may be compared, _mutatis mutandis_, with the reports from German Headquarters just before the first battle of the Marne.  \"The defeat of the English is complete,\" said the German High Command in the latter days of August, 1914. \"The English Army is retreating in the most complete disorder.... The British have been completely defeated to the north of St. Quentin\"--and so on. And yet a week later, as General Maurice, with much fresh evidence, has lately shown, the Army thus disposed of on paper had rejoicingly turned upon von Kluck, and was playing a vital part in the great victory of the Marne. So last spring, the losses and withdrawals of a vaster defensive action, coupled with the stubborn and tenacious hold of the British Army, last March and April, were the inevitable and heroic prelude to the victorious recoil of August, and the final battles of the war. Inevitable, because no forethought or exertion on the British side could have averted the German onslaught, determined as it was by the breakdown of the whole Eastern front of the war, and the letting loose upon the Western front of immense forces previously held by the Russian armies. These forces, after the Russian _dÃ©bÃ¢cle_, were released against us, week by week, till in March the balance of numbers, which was almost even in January, had risen on the German side to a superiority of 150,000 bayonets! The dispatch of divisions to Italy; the recall of men to the shipyards and the mines to meet the submarine danger; the heavy fighting in the Salient and at Cambrai in the latter half of 1917; the lack of time for training new levies, owing to our depleted line and reserves:--all these causes contributed to sharpen the peril in which England stood.[5] But it is in such straits as these that our race shows its quality.    [5] See the Chart at end of Book.  And in this fighting, for the first time in British history, and in the history of Europe, Americans stood side by side in battle with British and French. \"In the battle of March and April,\" says Sir Douglas Haig, \"American and British troops have fought shoulder to shoulder in the same trenches, and have shared together in the satisfaction of beating off German attacks. All ranks of the British Army look forward to the day when the rapidly growing strength of the American Army will allow American and British soldiers _to co-operate in offensive action_.\"  That day came without much delay. It carried the British Army to Mons, and the young American Army to Sedan.         *       *       *       *       *  Looking out from the Vimy Ridge six weeks ago, and driving thence through Arras across the Drocourt-QuÃ©ant line to Douai and Valenciennes, I was in the very heart of that triumphant stand of the Third and First Armies round Arras which really determined the fate of the German attack.  The Vimy Ridge from the west is a stiffish climb. On the east also it drops steeply above Petit Vimy and Vimy, while on the south and south-east it rises so imperceptibly from the Arras road that the legend which describes the Commander-in-Chief, approaching it from that side, as asking of the officers assembled to meet him after the victory--\"And where is this ridge that you say you have taken?\" seems almost a reasonable tale. But to east and west there is no doubt about it. One climbs up the side overlooking Ablain St. Nazaire through shell-holes and blurred trenches, over snags of wire, and round the edges of craters, till on the top one takes breath on the wide plateau where stands the Canadian monument to those who fell in the glorious fight of April 9th, 1917, and whence the eye sweeps that wide northern and eastern plain, towards Lille on the one side and Douai on the other, which to our war-beaten and weary soldiers, looking out upon it when the ridge at last was theirs, was almost as new and strange a world as the Pacific was to its first European beholders.  Westwards across the valley whence our troops stormed the hill, rises the Bouvigny Wood, and the long, blood-stained ridge of Notre Dame de Lorette, where I stood just before the battle, in 1917. To the north we are looking through the horizon shadows to La BassÃ©e, Bailleul, and the Salient. Immediately below the hill, in the same direction, lie the ruin heaps of Lens, and of the mining towns surrounding it; while behind us the ground slopes south and south-east to Arras and the Scarpe.  It is a tremendous position. That even the merest outsider can see. In old days the hill must have been a pleasant rambling ground for the tired workers of the coal-mining districts. Then the war-blast at its fiercest passed over it. To-day in its renewed solitude, its sacred peace, it represents one of the master points of the war, bought and held by a sacrifice of life and youth, the thought of which holds one's heart in grip, as one stands there, trying to gather in the meaning of the scene. Not one short year ago it was in the very centre of the struggle. If Arras and Vimy had not held, things would have been grave indeed. Had they been captured, says the official report of the Third Army, \"our main lateral communications--Amiens--Doullens--St. Pol--St. Omer--would have been seriously threatened if not cut.\" The Germans were determined to have them, and they fought for them with a desperate courage. Three assault divisions were to have carried the Vimy Ridge, while other divisions were to have captured Arras and the line of the Scarpe. The attack was carried out with the greatest fierceness, men marching shoulder to shoulder into the furnace of battle. But this time there was no fog to shield them, or to blind the British guns. The enemy losses were appalling, and after one day's fighting, in spite of the more northerly attacks on our line still to come, the German hopes of _victory_ were in the dust, and--as we now know--for ever.  That is what Vimy means--what Arras means--in the fighting of last year. We ponder it as we drive through the wrecked beauty of Arras and out on to the Douai road on our way to Valenciennes. We passed slowly along the road to the east of Arras, honeycombed still with dug-outs, and gun emplacements, and past trenches and wire fields, till suddenly a mere sign-board, nothing more--\"Gavrelle!\"--shows us that we are approaching the famous Drocourt-QuÃ©ant switch of the Hindenburg line, which the Canadians and the 17th British Corps, under Sir Henry Horne, stormed and took in September of last year. Presently, on either side of the road as we drive slowly eastward, a wilderness of trenches runs north and south. With what confident hope the Germans dug and fortified and elaborated them years ago!--with what contempt of death and danger our men carried them not six months since! And now not a sign of life anywhere--nothing but groups of white crosses here and there, emerging from the falling dusk, and the _dÃ©bris_ of battle along the road.  A weary way to Douai, over the worst road we have struck yet, and a weary way beyond it to Denain and Valenciennes. Darkness falls and hides the monotonous scene of ruin, which indeed begins to change as we approach Valenciennes, the Headquarters of the First Army. And at last, a bright fire in an old room piled with books and papers, a kind welcoming from the officer"]]]
