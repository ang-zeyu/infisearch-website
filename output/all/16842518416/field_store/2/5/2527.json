We both knew her, Cuthbert.\"  \"Yes, when she was a bright-hearted merry village maiden. Poor Kyneswith!\"  \"For her sake, then, let us both try to do something for the boy.\"  \"With all my heart. I will seek an opportunity of speaking to him, perhaps he may unburden his mind.\"  \"Have you seen Edric the sheriff?\" asked Elfwyn.  \"Not lately. Has he been here?\"  \"He has, and there was something in connection with his visit which troubled me. He had been telling me for a long time about the cruelties and insolence of the Danes, when he added, in a marked manner, that they might go too far, for hundreds of their countrymen, like Anlaf here, were living unprotected amongst us.\"  \"What could he mean?\"  \"I understood him to hint that we might revenge ourselves upon them, and replied that whatever their countrymen might be guilty of, our neighbours would, of course, always be safe amongst Christians.\"  \"What did he reply?\"  \"He changed the subject.\"  Elfwyn said no more, but bade me goodbye and returned to the castle; still I saw that he was a little discomposed by the sheriff's words. I don't like that sheriff; he is a cruel and a crafty man; but I daresay his words were only the expression of a passing thought.    CHAPTER II. \"ALFGAR, SON OF ANLAF.\"   SUNDAY, November 6th.--  Today I noticed Alfgar, the son of Anlaf, at the high mass, and felt a little discomposed at the relaxation of discipline, which, contrary to the canons of the church, permits the unbaptized, as well as persons who ought rightly to be deemed excommunicate, or at least penitents, to be present at the holy mysteries.  But it is not this poor boy's fault that he is not a Christian, for I have seen him, and learned for a certainty the real state of his mind.  The way in which it came about was this. I marked that after service he entered the woods, as if he shunned the society of his fellow worshippers, and there I followed him, coming upon him at last, as if by accident, in a chestnut glade, the leaves of which strewed the ground--emblem of our fading mortality.  He started as he saw me, and at first looked as if he were inclined to fly my presence, but I gently addressed him.  \"Dominus vobiscum, my son,\" I said. \"I am pleased to see you sometimes at the minster church.\"  \"I did not know I was noticed amongst so many,\" he replied.  \"You mean, my boy, that you would sooner your presence were not observed. I can guess your reason too well.\"  He looked so sad, that I was sorry I had spoken precipitately, and a deep red blush suffused his dark countenance. He has a most attractive face--so thoughtful, yet so manly; his mother's gentle lineaments seem to have tempered the somewhat fierce and haughty bearing of his sire, as they meet in the countenance of their child.  My sympathy became so deep that I could not restrain myself and spoke out:  \"My boy, will you not confide your troubles to me, for your dear mother's sake? Do you not remember how she commended you to my care? And never have I forgotten to pray daily that her God may be your God also.\"  At the mention of his mother the tears filled his eyes. We were sitting together on the trunk of a fallen tree, and he covered his face with his hands, but I could see that the tears forced their way between the fingers, and that he was sobbing violently. He is only as yet a mere boy, and such emotion is excusable.  At last he looked up.  \"I long to be a Christian like her,\" he said; \"over and over again she taught me, during her last days on earth, of the Christ she loved, and who, she said, was ever near her. I have heard all about the faith she loved, yet I am an outcast from it. What can I do?--my father will not let me be baptized, and I dare not oppose his will; yet I sometimes think I ought to chance all, and to die, if death should be the penalty.\"  \"Die? You do not surely think he would slay you?\"  \"I know he would.\"  \"In that case, my child, your duty seems plain: your Lord calls you to give Him your love, your obedience, and to seek refuge in the fold of His church.\"  \"Ought I to leave my father?\"  I felt very much puzzled indeed what to say. I could have no doubt as to the lad's duty; but then his father was his natural guardian, and in all things, save the plain duty of professing Christ, had a claim to his obedience.  \"I think,\" I said at last, \"my Alfgar, that when he knew you were determined to be a Christian he would oppose you no longer; that is, if you were once baptized he would tolerate a Christian son as he once did a Christian wife.\"  \"He broke her heart.\"  \"At all events I think that you should delay no longer, but should seek instruction and baptism, which we will afford you; and then, unless you really feel life is in danger, you should return to him and try to bear your lot; it may not be so hard as you think.\"  \"I am not afraid of death; but he is my father, and from his hands it would be hard.\"  \"He hates Christianity grievously then?\"  \"He says it is the religion of cowards and hypocrites; that it forms a plea for cowardice when men dare not be men, and is thrown aside fast enough when they have their foes in their power.\"  Alas! I could but feel how much reason the ill lives of Christians had given him to form this opinion, and of the curse pronounced upon those who shall put a stumbling block in their brother's way. The conversation of the Sheriff, Edric Streorn, rose up in my mind as an apt illustration of Anlaf's words.  \"My boy,\" I said, \"there is nothing perfect on earth. In the visible church the evil is mingled with the good. Yet the church is the fold of the Good Shepherd, and there is salvation therein for all who love and serve their Lord, and strive humbly to follow His example, and those of His blessed Saints.\"  \"May I think over all you have said, and meet you next Sunday? You will be here, will you not?\"  And he looked imploringly in my face. Poor boy! my heart bled for him.  So we parted, and he went home.  Friday, November 11th.--  I feel thoroughly uneasy and anxious about the sheriff's proceedings. He has been about the neighbourhood today, and seems to have been talking secretly with all the black sheep of my flock; thank God, I do not think there are many. What they can be going to do, or what plot they are hatching, I cannot discover, only I fear that it is some design for vengeance upon the Danes--some dark treachery plotted against those in our midst; and, if such is the case, I can but feel uneasy for poor Alfgar. I wish the lad would leave his home, if but for a short time, until the signs are less threatening; but he would not forsake his father in danger, and I ought hardly to wish it.  St. Brice's Day, Sunday, November 13th--  This has been a harassing and eventful day. Early in the morning, before the high mass, whereat the neighbourhood is generally present, I received a missive from the sheriff, bidding me, in the name of the King, to exhort my people to remain at home tonight, since danger is afoot, and there is likely, he says, to be a rising on the part of the pagans who dwell amongst us. Why, they are but one in five in this neighbourhood; hardly that. I determined to give the message in my own way, for I could not keep silent, lest, through fault of mine, any of my sheep should perish. So I preached upon the Saint of the day, who was pre-eminently a man of peace, and I took occasion to tell my people that there were many hurtful men about, who, like their master, Satan, were seeking whom they might devour, and that, like that master, they chose the night for their misdeeds, seeing they loved darkness rather than light. So I said I hoped every good Christian would keep at home, and go to bed early.  At this point I observed a sarcastic smile upon many faces, notably on those of the black sheep aforesaid, to whom the sheriff had spoken, and I concluded that they were very likely to be the ministers of darkness themselves. So I spoke on the Christian duties of love and forgiveness, and exhorted all present to take joyfully the chastisement of the Lord, even like holy Job; and that it would all tend to their eternal good, through Him who, when He was reviled, reviled not again. And so with this exhortation to patience I closed my homily. I fear I spoke to many in vain.  I am sure they are bent on immediate mischief, and that this notice of the sheriff has much to do with it. He wants to keep good people at home to have all the field to himself. I see him--the black bellwether.  After mass I mingled with the dispersing congregation. The weather was very gloomy--the faces of the congregation yet more so. All seemed to apprehend coming evil. Instead of returning cheerfully home they stood together in groups, talking in low tones, as if they feared to speak their thoughts aloud.  Most of them evidently were men of peace, but not all, as I have already hinted; and, as I drew near a group standing behind the great yew tree, I heard one of these latter discoursing to his fellows.  \"Heard you the prior's sermon?\" said Siric, for that was the fellow, Siric of the Wold; \"a fine homily he gave us on St. Brice--that man of peace.\"  \"It was easy for him to be a man of peace,\" returned another; \"he hadn't got Danes for his neighbours.\"  \"Holy Job himself would have turned cutthroat if he had.\"  \"Then they have been insulting, robbing, and murdering all over the country.\"  Just then I interrupted them, for I could no longer hear the blasphemy.  \"How now, Siric,\" said I; \"hast thou come to Aescendune to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13305"],["title","Alfgar the Dane or the Second Chronicle of Aescendune (#3)"],["body","the saints?\"  \"Nay, Father,\" said he, with a mocking smile; \"I was only rejoicing that they were not exposed to such trials as we. Job's Chaldeans were gentlefolk in comparison with our Danes.\"  \"Thou blasphemest; and what didst thou say of the blessed St. Brice?\"  \"Only that I wished he were living now to tame the cutthroats who live in our midst, and who murder and rob daily, just in mere sport, or to keep their hands in.\"  \"What new outrages have occurred?\" I asked.  \"A party of the heathen carried off the cattle from my farm down the water early this morning, and slew the herdsman.\"  \"Dost thou know who the fellows were?\"  \"All too well; they were Anlaf's men.\"  I hardly knew what to answer, the outrage was so recent, and the excitement of the speaker so pardonable, as I could but feel.  Well, at this moment my brother Elfwyn came out of the church, where he had lingered to pray, as he generally does, at his brother's tomb, and, noticing us, came and joined the group. He seemed much concerned when he heard the details.  \"Siric,\" he said, with his usual kind way of speaking, \"do not distress yourself unduly; you know I am rich in flocks and herds. I will make up the loss of the cattle, my brother the prior will have a mass said for poor Guthred, and he shall have the last rites performed at our expense; it is all we can do for him; the rest we must leave to the mercy of God.\"  \"Nay, Thane,\" said Siric; \"I thank you for your goodwill, but I may not stand thus indebted to any man. I will repay myself at the expense of the robbers. Still you may remember Guthred at God's altar.\"  And he strode away.  My brother was now joined by his children Bertric and Ethelgiva, and his wife, the Lady Hilda. I saw that he was ill at ease, but we did not mention the subject, which I am sure was uppermost in both our minds, lest we should alarm the gentle ones.  Just then I remembered that I had promised to meet Alfgar in the pine wood, and I hastened to the spot.  I found him seated again on the fallen tree. He rose at my approach, and saluted me with some emotion, as if some inward excitement made itself visible in spite of his efforts to suppress it.  \"My son,\" said I, \"have you pondered my words of last Sunday?\"  \"I have, and I am come to put myself under your instruction. I will be guided by you in all things, and fulfil thus the dying wish of the only being who ever loved me.\"  \"But, my boy, there must be yet a higher, a holier motive.\"  \"I trust it is not wanting, my father.\"  \"Are you able to stay long today?\"  \"O yes, my father is keeping high festival; a number of his countrymen are visiting him and holding revel; this morning they drove in a number of oxen, I know not whence, and slaughtered two on the spot, and they have broached several barrels of mead; they will keep the feast all day, and before night my father will not be in a state to miss me; I always absent myself if I can on such occasions.\"  \"Then you must come home with me, and share the noon meat, after which I can give you my time until evensong.\"  He made no objection, and we returned to the Priory together, where he took his noon meat in the guest chamber, and I devoted all the time between the meal and nones to an examination of my catechumen.  I found that poor Kyneswith had impressed all the primary truths of our holy faith deeply upon his mind, although he wanted much building up, and needed instruction in details; he seemed deeply impressed by the main facts of the life and teaching of our blessed Lord, particularly His message of peace on earth, good will towards men, contrasting so forcibly with the faith of his own people.  The time passed rapidly away, and we went to the minster church at three, when nones and evensong were said together, for we could not keep the people till the proper hour for the latter office, owing to the darkness of November.  When the holy office was over, I accompanied my brother part of the way home, for I wanted to communicate my suspicions, and to learn whether he shared them.  It was a dark and gloomy eventide: the sun, which had only made its appearance at intervals during the day, was fast sinking behind a heavy bank of clouds which filled the western horizon; and the wind, which was freshening to a gale, seemed to bear the storm onward in its track, while it tore the few surviving leaves rudely from the trees, and whirled them in mazy windings.  \"Elfwyn,\" said I, \"what do you suppose was the true object of the sheriff in bidding folks keep indoors tonight?\"  \"I cannot divine, unless he has some deed of blood on hand which he wishes to have undisturbed, all to himself and his underlings.\"  \"Siric spoke mysteriously.\"  \"Yes; if there is aught going on amiss, he has a hand in it.\"  Here I communicated my fears respecting Alfgar, whom I had invited, with my brother's permission, to sup at the hall.  \"Could you not keep the poor fellow with you all night? I fear his father is in some danger, as well he may be, acting as wickedly as he did this very morn.\"  \"I will try to persuade him to stay, he is along with Bertric and Ethelgiva; they are only a few steps behind. Cuthbert, I have ordered every one of my theows and ceorls to be obedient to your warning if they wish to preserve their allegiance to Aescendune, or to escape chastisement, and I think none of them are likely to be abroad tonight.\"  \"Can you not find out what the sheriff has told them? I saw him speaking to one or two.\"  \"I will try. You must be my guest tonight, or at least for a few hours.\"  \"Nay, I must return to compline; I may be wanted tonight, and ought to be at my post,\" said I.  We arrived at the old home, dear familiar place! stronger and better built than most such houses, because, being burnt down in my father's younger days, it had been rebuilt in a more substantial manner, and was capable of sustaining a formidable attack successfully.  We crossed the drawbridge, and entered the courtyard under the gateway; before us was the door of the great hall, merrily illumined by its blazing fire.  There, then, was the supper table bountifully spread, and the theows and ceorls awaiting the arrival of their lord. We entered, Elfwyn and I, and soon after Bertric, Ethelgiva, and Alfgar followed.  A loud horn was blown upon the battlements. Stragglers made their entrance good; the drawbridge was drawn up, the doors closed, and I blessed the meat.    CHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF ST. BRICE.   Monday, November 14th, 1002.--  I hardly know how to write the events of last night, my pen almost refuses to begin. I feel thoroughly sickened by the very remembrance of the bloodshed and treachery which have disgraced Christian England, and which will assuredly bring down God's judgment upon us.  But I will do violence to myself, and will write all things accurately, in order it may serve to show that there were those amongst us who were not consenting parties, who entered not into the counsels of those men of blood, whom may God \"reward after their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their own inventions.\"  Well, to begin. When supper was ended at the hall last night, my brother bade his wife and children seek their bower, and Alfgar went with them; then he addressed his people with that confidence and affection he not only shows in his outward speech, but really feels in his heart.  \"Are all the folk present within the gates?\" he asked.  \"We are all here, my lord,\" replied they; \"none have been wanting in their duty.\"  \"It is well; and now, my people, I ask you, whom I have ever trusted, and to whom I have tried to be a friend as well as a master, have you any of you a suspicion what the sheriff is about tonight, and why he desired the prior to tell good Christians to keep within doors?\"  There was a dead silence. At last one of the ceorls rose up, and spoke with some hesitation:  \"I think, my lord, that they intend to avenge themselves upon the Dane folk.\"  \"Did they say anything about it to you or any other of my people?\"  \"Yes; they tried to get two or three of us to join in the work, but when they found we would do nothing without your knowledge, they told us no more.\"  \"Then you do not know what is the exact work they have in hand?\"  \"No. But I heard something which made me think that plunder and massacre were both likely to be committed.\"  \"Did you hear any particular names mentioned?\"  \"Yes. That of Anlaf.\"  \"This explains Siric's insolence, Cuthbert.\"  \"It does,\" I replied.  \"But surely they cannot intend to do anything tonight. They would not choose Sunday for a deed of darkness. Men who have attended mass during the day, surely would not so forget their God as to go through the country like cowardly wolves, pulling down the prey in company which they dare not attack singly.\"  \"I should hope the same; but then the looks and words of today,\" said I.  \"Did they say what authority they had for their projected scheme?\"  \"They dared to say,\" replied the ceorl who had before spoken, \"they had the sanction of the king.\"  There was again a painful silence. We groaned in the bitterness of our hearts--O Ethelred, son of Edgar, hast thou forgotten all truth and mercy?--thou, the son of Edgar the Magnanimous?  Every impulse of our hearts led us to detest the cruel deed of treachery about to be consummated, but which we could not prevent.  At least there was one whom we could save from the general destruction, the young Alfgar, and we determined to detain him if possible by persuasion, keeping the truth from him, but in any case to detain him at the hall during the night.  I could not remain at the hall myself, for, on such a night, it seemed necessary to be with my own people, and to be ready to seize any opportunity of saving the effusion of blood, or of giving protection to any who might seek refuge under the shelter of our roof, where murder would be sacrilege, a consideration of some importance where Christians, shame to say, were the murderers.
