And the country may seem gloomy too, with all its forests, all its old forests without light. But that may all be enlivened if we will. And then, joy, joy, one does not have it every day; we must take things as they come. But tell me something; no matter what; I will do everything you could wish....  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes; it is true.... You never see the sky here. I saw it for the first time this morning....  GOLAUD.  It is that, then, that makes you weep, my poor Mélisande?--It is only that, then?--You weep, not to see the sky?--Come, come, you are no longer at the age when one may weep for such things.... And then, is not the summer yonder? You will see the sky every day.--And then, next year.... Come, give me your hand; give me both your little hands. [_He takes her hands._] Oh! oh! these little hands that I could crush like flowers....--Hold! where is the ring I gave you?  MÉLISANDE.  The ring?  GOLAUD.  Yes; our wedding-ring, where is it?  MÉLISANDE.  I think.... I think it has fallen....  GOLAUD.  Fallen?--Where has it fallen?--You have not lost it?  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; it fell ... it must have fallen.... But I know where it is....  GOLAUD.  Where is it?  MÉLISANDE.  You know ... you know well ... the grotto by the seashore?...  GOLAUD.  Yes.  MÉLISANDE.  Well then, it is there.... It must be it is there.... Yes, yes; I remember.... I went there this morning to pick up shells for little Yniold.... There were some very fine ones.... It slipped from my finger ... then the sea came in; and I had to go out before I had found it.  GOLAUD.  Are you sure it is there?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes; quite sure.... I felt it slip ... then, all at once, the noise of the waves....  GOLAUD.  You must go look for it at once.  MÉLISANDE.  I must go look for it at once?  GOLAUD.  Yes.  MÉLISANDE.  Now?--at once?--in the dark?  GOLAUD.  Now, at once, in the dark. You must go look for it at once. I had rather have lost all I have than have lost that ring. You do not know what it is. You do not know whence it came. The sea will be very high to-night. The sea will come to take it before you.... Make haste. You must go look for it at once....  MÉLISANDE.  I dare not.... I dare not go alone....  GOLAUD.  Go, go with no matter whom. But you must go at once, do you understand?--Make haste; ask Pélléas to go with you.  MÉLISANDE.  Pélléas?--With Pélléas?--But Pélléas would not....  GOLAUD.  Pélléas will do all you ask of him. I know Pélléas better than you do. Go, go; hurry! I shall not sleep until I have the ring.  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! oh! I am not happy!... I am not happy!...                                                           [_Exit, weeping._     SCENE III.--_Before a grotto._   _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS _and_ MÉLISANDE.  [_Speaking with great agitation._] Yes; it is here; we are there. It is so dark you cannot tell the entrance of the grotto from the rest of the night.... There are no stars on this side. Let us wait till the moon has torn through that great cloud; it will light up the whole grotto, and then we can enter without danger. There are dangerous places, and the path is very narrow between two lakes whose bottom has not yet been found. I did not think to bring a torch or a lantern, but I think the light of the sky will be enough for us.--You have never gone into this grotto?  MÉLISANDE.  No....  PÉLLÉAS.  Let us go in; let us go in.... You must be able to describe the place where you lost the ring, if he questions you.... It is very big and very beautiful. There are stalactites that look like plants and men. It is full of blue darks. It has not yet been explored to the end. There are great treasures hidden there, it seems. You will see the remains of ancient shipwrecks there. But you must not go far in it without a guide. There have been some who never have come back. I myself dare not go forward too far. We will stop the moment we no longer see the light of the sea or the sky. When you strike a little light there, you would say the vault was covered with stars like the sky. It is bits of crystal or salt, they say, that shine so in the rock.--Look, look, I think the sky is going to clear.... Give me your hand; do not tremble, do not tremble so. There is no danger; we will stop the moment we no longer see the light of the sea.... Is it the noise of the grotto that frightens you? It is the noise of night or the noise of silence.... Do you hear the sea behind us?--It does not seem happy to-night.... Ah! look, the light!...      [The moon lights up abundantly the entrance and part of the     darkness of the grotto; and at a certain depth are seen three     old beggars with white hair, seated side by side, leaning upon     each other and asleep against a bowlder.]  MÉLISANDE.  Ah!  PÉLLÉAS.  What is it?  MÉLISANDE.  There are ... there are....                                        [_She points out the three Beggars._  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes, yes; I have seen them too....  MÉLISANDE.  Let us go!... Let us go!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes ... it is three old poor men fallen asleep.... There is a famine in the country.... Why have they come to sleep here....  MÉLISANDE.  Let us go!... Come, come.... Let us go!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Take care; do not speak so loud.... Let us not wake them.... They are still sleeping heavily.... Come.  MÉLISANDE.  Leave me, leave me; I prefer to walk alone....  PÉLLÉAS.  We will come back another day....                                [_Exeunt._     SCENE IV.--_An apartment in the castle,_ ARKËL _and_ PÉLLÉAS _discovered._   ARKËL.  You see that everything retains you here just now and forbids you this useless journey. We have concealed your father's condition from you until now; but it is perhaps hopeless; and that alone should suffice to stop you on the threshold. But there are so many other reasons.... And it is not in the day when our enemies awake, and when the people are dying of hunger and murmur about us, that you have the right to desert us. And why this journey? Marcellus is dead; and life has graver duties than the visit to a tomb. You are weary, you say, of your inactive life; but activity and duty are not found on the highways. They must be waited for upon the threshold, and let in as they go by; and they go by every day. You have never seen them? I hardly see them any more myself; but I will teach you to see them, and I will point them out to you the day when you would make them a sign. Nevertheless, listen to me; if you believe it is from the depths of your life this journey is exacted, I do not forbid your undertaking it, for you must know better than I the events you must offer to your being or your fate. I shall ask you only to wait until we know what must take place ere long....  PÉLLÉAS.  How long must I wait?  ARKËL.  A few weeks; perhaps a few days....  PÉLLÉAS.  I will wait....     ACT THIRD     SCENE I.--_An apartment in the castle._ PÉLLÉAS _and_ MÉLISANDE _discovered_, MÉLISANDE _plies her distaff at the back of the room._   PÉLLÉAS.  Yniold does not come back; where has he gone?  MÉLISANDE  He had heard something in the corridor; he has gone to see what it is.  PÉLLÉAS.  Mélisande....  MÉLISANDE  What is it?  PÉLLÉAS.  ... Can you see still to work there?...  MÉLISANDE  I work as well in the dark....  PÉLLÉAS.  I think everybody is already asleep in the castle. Golaud does not come back from the chase. It is late, nevertheless.... He no longer suffers from his fall?...  MÉLISANDE.  He said he no longer suffered from it.  PÉLLÉAS.  He must be more prudent; his body is no longer as supple as at twenty years.... I see the stars through the window and the light of the moon on the trees. It is late; he will not come back now. [_Knocking at the door._] Who is there?... Come in!...  _Little_ YNIOLD _opens the door and enters the room._  It was you knocking so?... That is not the way to knock at doors. It is as if a misfortune had arrived; look, you have frightened little mother.  LITTLE YNIOLD.  I only knocked a tiny little bit.  PÉLLÉAS.  It is late; little father will not come back to-night; it is time for you to go to bed.  LITTLE YNIOLD.  I shall not go to bed before you do.  PÉLLÉAS.  What?... What is that you are saying?  LITTLE YNIOLD.  I say ... not before you ... not before you....  [_Bursts into sobs and takes refuge by_ MÉLISANDE.]  MÉLISANDE.  What is it, Yniold?... What is it?... why do you weep all at once?  YNIOLD _(sobbing)._  Because ... oh! oh! because ...  MÉLISANDE.  Because what?... Because what?... Tell me ...  YNIOLD.  Little mother ... little mother ... you are going away....  MÉLISANDE.  But what has taken hold of you, Yniold?... I have never dreamed of going away....  YNIOLD.  Yes, you have; yes, you have; little father has gone away.... Little father does not come back, and you are going to go away too.... I have seen it ... I have seen it....  MÉLISANDE.  But there has never been any idea of that, Yniold.... Why, what makes you think that I would go away?...  YNIOLD.  I have seen it ... I have seen it.... You have said things to uncle that I could not hear....  PÉLLÉAS.  He is sleepy.... He has been dreaming.... Come here, Yniold; asleep already?... Come and look out at the window; the swans are fighting with the dogs....  YNIOLD _(at the window)._  Oh! oh! they are chasing the dogs!... They are chasing them!... Oh! oh! the water!... the wings!... the wings!... they are afraid....  PÉLLÉAS. _(coming back by_ MÉLISANDE_)._  He is sleepy; he is struggling against sleep; his eyes were closing....  MÉLISANDE _(singing softly as she spins)._    Saint Daniel and Saint Michaël....   Saint Michaël and Saint Raphaël....  YNIOLD _(at the window)._  Oh! oh! little mother!...  MÉLISANDE _(rising abruptly)._  What is it, Yniold?... What is it?...  YNIOLD.  I saw something at the window?...                               [PÉLLÉAS _and_ MÉLISANDE _run to the window._  PÉLLÉAS.  What is there at the window?... What have you seen?...  YNIOLD.  Oh! oh!

MÉLISANDE.  Nor I....  PÉLLÉAS.  Where did you see something? Which way?...  YNIOLD.  Down there, down there!... It is no longer there....  PÉLLÉAS.  He does not know what he is saying. He must have seen the light of the moon on the forest. There are often strange reflections,... or else something must have passed on the highway ... or in his sleep. For see, see, I believe he is quite asleep....  YNIOLD _(at the window)._  Little father is there! little father is there!  PÉLLÉAS _(going to the window)._  He is right; Golaud is coming into the courtyard....  YNIOLD.  Little father!... little father!... I am going to meet him!...                                               [_Exit, running,--A silence._  PÉLLÉAS.  They are coming up the stair....  _Enter_ GOLAUD _and little_ YNIOLD _with a lamp._  GOLAUD.  You are still waiting in the dark?  YNIOLD.  I have brought a light, little mother, a big light!... [_He lifts the lamp and looks at_ MÉLISANDE.] You have been weeping, little mother?... You have been, weeping?... [_He lifts the lamp toward_ PÉLLÉAS _and looks in turn at him._] You too, you too, you have been weeping?... Little father, look, little father; they have both been weeping....  GOLAUD.  Do not hold the light under their eyes so....    SCENE II.--_One of the towers of the castle.--watchman's round passes under a window in the tower._   MÉLISANDE _(at the window, combing her unbound hair)._    My long locks fall foaming     To the threshold of the tower,--   My locks await your coming     All along the tower,     And all the long, long hour,     And all the long, long hour.    _Saint Daniel and Saint Michaël,_   _Saint Michaël and Saint Raphaël._    I was born on a Sunday,     A Sunday at high noon....  _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS _by the watchman's round._  PÉLLÉAS.  Holà! Holà! ho!...  MÉLISANDE.  Who is there?  PÉLLÉAS.  I, I, and I!... What art thou doing there at the window, singing like a bird that is not native here?  MÉLISANDE.  I am doing my hair for the night...  PÉLLÉAS.  Is it that I see upon the wall?... I thought you had some light....  MÉLISANDE.  I have opened the window; it is too hot in the tower.... It is beautiful to-night....  PÉLLÉAS.  There are innumerable stars; I have never seen so many as to-night;... but the moon is still upon the sea.... Do not stay in the shadow, Mélisande; lean forward a little till I see your unbound hair....  MÉLISANDE.  I am frightful so....                                             [_She learn out at the window._  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh! oh! Mélisande!... oh, thou art beautiful!... thou art beautiful so!... Lean out! lean out!... Let me come nearer thee....  MÉLISANDE  I cannot come nearer thee.... I am leaning out as far as I can....  PÉLLÉAS.  I cannot come up higher;... give me at least thy hand to-night ... before I go away.... I leave to-morrow....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no, no!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes, yes, yes; I leave, I shall leave to-morrow.... Give me thy hand, thy hand, thy little hand upon my lips....  MÉLISANDE.  I give thee not my hand if thou wilt leave....  PÉLLÉAS.  Give, give, give!...  MÉLISANDE.  Thou wilt not leave?...  PÉLLÉAS.  I will wait; I will wait....  MÉLISANDE.  I see a rose in the shadows....  PÉLLÉAS.  Where?... I see only the boughs of the willow hanging over the wall....  MÉLISANDE.  Further down, further down, in the garden; further down, in the sombre green....  PÉLLÉAS.  It is not a rose.... I will go see by and by, but give me thy hand first; first thy hand....  MÉLISANDE.  There, there;... I cannot lean out further....  PÉLLÉAS.  I cannot reach thy hand with my lips....  MÉLISANDE.  I cannot lean out further.... I am on the point of falling....--Oh! oh! my hair is falling down the tower!...  [_Her tresses fall suddenly over her head, as she is leaning out so, and stream over_ PÉLLÉAS]  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh! oh! what is it?... Thy hair, thy hair is falling down to me!... All thy locks, Mélisande, all thy locks have fallen down the tower!... I hold them in my hands; I hold them in my mouth.... I hold them in my arms; I put them about my neck.... I will not open my hands again to-night....  MÉLISANDE.  Let me go! let me go!... Thou wilt make me fall!...  PÉLLÉAS.  No, no, no;... I have never seen such hair as thine, Mélisande!... See, see, see; it comes from so high and yet it floods me to the heart!... And yet it floods me to the knees!... And it is sweet, sweet as if it fell from heaven!... I see the sky no longer through thy locks. Thou seest, thou seest?... I can no longer hold them with both hands; there are some on the boughs of the willow.... They are alive like birds in my hands,... and they love me, they love me more than thou!...  MÉLISANDE.  Let me go; let me go!... Some one might come....  PÉLLÉAS.  No, no, no; I shall not set thee free to-night.... Thou art my prisoner to-night; all night, all night!...  MÉLISANDE.  Pélléas! Pélléas!...  PÉLLÉAS.  I tie them, I tie them to the willow boughs.... Thou shalt not go away now;... thou shalt not go away now.... Look, look, I am kissing thy hair.... I suffer no more in the midst of thy hair.... Hearest thou my kisses along thy hair?... They mount along thy hair.... Each hair must bring thee some.... Thou seest, thou seest, I can open my hands.... My hands are free, and thou canst not leave me now....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! oh! thou hurtest me.... [_Doves come out of the tower and fly about them in the night._]--What is that, Pélléas?--What is it flying about me?  PÉLLÉAS.  It is the doves coming oat of the tower.... I have frightened them; they are flying away....  MÉLISANDE.  It is my doves, Pélléas.--Let us go away, let me go; they will not come back again....  PÉLLÉAS.  Why will they not come back again?  MÉLISANDE  They will be lost in the dark.... Let me go; let me lift my head.... I hear a noise of footsteps.... Let me go!--It is Golaud!... I believe it is Golaud!... He has heard us....  PÉLLÉAS.  Wait! Wait!... Thy hair is about the boughs.... It is caught there in the darkness.... Wait, wait!... It is dark....  _Enter_ GOLAUD, _by the watchman's round._  GOLAUD.  What do you here?  PÉLLÉAS.  What do I here?... I....  GOLAUD.  You are children.... Mélisande, do not lean out so at the window; you will fall.... Do you not know it is late?--It is nearly midnight.--Do not play so in the darkness.--You are children.... [_Laughing nervously._] What children!... What children!...                                                      [_Exit, with_ PÉLLÉAS.     SCENE III.--_The-vaults of the castle.   Enter_ GOLAUD _and_ PÉLLÉAS.  GOLAUD.  Take care; this way, this way.--You have never penetrated into these vaults?  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes; once, of old; but it was long ago....  GOLAUD.  They are prodigious great; it is a succession of enormous crypts that end, God knows where. The whole castle is builded on these crypts. Do you smell the deathly odor that reigns here?--That is what I wished, to show you. In my opinion, it comes from the little underground lake I am going to have you see. Take care; walk before me, in the light of my lantern. I will warn you when we are there, [_They continue to walk in silence._] Hey! hey! Pélléas! stop! stop!--[_He seizes him by the arm._] For God's sake!... Do you not see?--One step more, and you had been in the gulf!...  PÉLLÉAS  But I did not see it!... The lantern no longer lighted me....  GOLAUD.  I made a misstep.... but if I had not held you by the arm.... Well, this is the stagnant water that I spoke of to you.... Do you perceive the smell of death that rises?--Let us go to the end of this overhanging rock, and do you lean over a little. It will strike you in the face.  PÉLLÉAS.  I smell it already;... you would say a smell of the tomb.  GOLAUD.  Further, further.... It is this that on certain days has poisoned the castle. The King will not believe it comes from here.--The crypt should be walled up in which this standing water is found. It is time, besides, to examine these vaults a little. Have you noticed those lizards on the walls and pillars of the vaults?--There is a labor hidden here you would not suspect; and the whole castle will be swallowed up one of these nights, if it is not looked out for. But what will you have? nobody likes to come down this far.... There are strange lizards in many of the walls.... Oh! here ... do you perceive the smell of death that rises?  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes; there is a smell of death rising about us....  GOLAUD.  Lean over; have no fear.... I will hold you ... give me ... no, no, not your hand ... it might slip ... your arm, your arm!... Do you see the gulf? [_Moved._]--Pélléas? Pélléas?...  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes; I think I see the bottom of the gulf.... Is it the light that trembles so?... You ... [_He straightens up, turns, and looks at_ GOLAUD.]  GOLAUD (_with a trembling voice_).  Yes; it is the lantern.... See, I shook it to lighten the walls....  PÉLLÉAS.  I stifle here;... let us go out....  GOLAUD.  Yes; let us go out....                                                       [_Exeunt in silence._     SCENE IV.--_A terrace at the exit of the vaults. Enter_ GOLAUD _and_ PÉLLÉAS.   PÉLLÉAS.  Ah! I breathe at last!... I thought, one moment, I was going to be ill in those enormous crypts; I was on the point of falling.... There is a damp air there, heavy as a leaden dew, and darkness thick as a poisoned paste.... And now, all the air of all the sea!... There is a fresh wind, see; fresh as a leaf that has just opened, over the little green waves.... Hold! the flowers have just been watered at the foot of the terrace, and the smell of the verdure and the wet roses comes up to us.... It must be nearly noon; they are already in the shadow of the tower.... It is noon; I hear the bells ringing, and the children are going down to the beach to bathe.... I did not know that we had stayed so long in the caverns....  GOLAUD.  We went down towards eleven o'clock....  PÉLLÉAS.  Earlier; it must have been earlier; I heard it"]]]
