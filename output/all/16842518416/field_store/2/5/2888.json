He married a daughter of Jonathan Hanmer, the leading Nonconformist divine of the town, and by her had five children. The first-born was a girl, who died in 1685; then came Katherine, born in 1676, who married Anthony Baller, whose son Joseph issued in 1820 the slim volume bearing the title of \"Gay's Chair\";[3]in 1778, Jonathan; and three years later, Joanna, who married John Fortescue--possibly a relation of William Fortescue, afterwards Master of the Rolls, who is still remembered as a friend of Pope. The youngest child was John, the subject of this memoir, stated by his earlier biographers to have been born in 1688, but now known, from an entry in the Barnstaple Parish Register, to have been baptised in the Old Church on September 16th, 1685.  Mrs. Gay died in 1694, her husband a year later; and the custody of the four surviving orphaned children devolved upon their uncles. William Gay's brothers were John and Richard, who resided at Frittelstock; James, Rector of Meeth; and Thomas, who lived at Barnstaple. Mrs. Gay's only brother was John Hanmer, who succeeded to his father's pastoral office among the Congregational or Independent Dissenters at Barnstaple. Jonathan, the elder son of William Gay, who inherited the family property, was intended for the Church, but \"severe studies not well suiting his natural genius, he betook himself to military pursuits,\"[4] and, probably about the time of his father's death, entered the army. Who took charge of the two girls is not known; but it is on record that John, after his father's death, and then in his tenth year, went to live at Barnstaple with his paternal uncle, Thomas Gay. It is interesting to note that in 1882, \"among the pieces of timber carted away from the Barnstaple Parish Church [which was then undergoing restoration] has been found a portion of a pew, with the name 'John Gay,' and the date, 1695, cut upon it.... No other John Gay appears in the Parish Register.\"[5]  Gay attended the Free Grammar School at Barnstaple, and among his schoolfellows there with whom he cemented an enduring friendship, were William Fortescue, to whom reference has been made above, and Aaron Hill.[6] William Raynor was the headmaster when Gay first went to the Grammar School, but soon he removed to Tiverton, and was succeeded by the Rev. Robert Luck. Luck subsequently claimed that Gay's dramatic instincts were developed by taking part in the amateur theatricals promoted by him, and when in April, 1736, he published a volume of verse, he wrote, in his dedication to the Duke of Queensberry.[7] Gay's patron and friend:--    \"O Queensberry! could happy Gay     This offering to thee bring,   ''Tis he, my Lord' (he'd smiling say),     'Who taught your Gay to sing.'\"  These lines suggest that an intimacy between Gay and Luck existed long after their relations as pupil and master had ceased, but it is doubtful if this was the case. It is certainly improbable that the lad saw much of the pedagogue when he returned to Barnstaple for a while as the guest of the Rev. John Hanmer, since Luck was a bitter opponent of the Dissenters and in open antagonism to John Hanmer.  How long Gay remained at the Grammar School is not known. There are, indeed, no records upon which to base a narrative of his early years. It is, however, generally accepted that, on leaving school, he was apprenticed to a silk-mercer in London. This was not so unaccountable a proceeding then as appears to-day, for we know from Gibbon's \"Memoirs\" that \"our most respectable families have not disdained the counting-house, or even the shop;... and in England, as well as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been compelled to declare that gentility is not degraded by the exercise of trade\": for example, the historian's great grandfather, son of a country gentleman, became a linen-draper in Leadenhall Street.  Gay had no taste for trade, and did not long remain in this employment. According to one authority, \"he grew so fond of reading and study that he frequently neglected to exert himself in putting oft silks and velvets to the ladies\";[8] while his nephew, the Rev. Joseph Bailer, says: \"Young Gay, not being able to bear the confinement of a shop, soon felt a remarkable depression of spirits, and consequent decline of health; he was, therefore, obliged to quit that situation, and retire to Barnstaple, in the hope of receiving benefit from his native air.\"[9] No doubt the mercer was willing enough to cancel the indentures of an apprentice so unsatisfactory as Gay probably was. Anyhow, Gay returned to Barnstaple, and stayed awhile with his maternal uncle, the Rev. John Hanmer.  It has been said that it was during this visit to Barnstaple that Gay began to write verses; and as most men who take to poetry began to dabble in ink in their youth, this statement may well be accepted. Only, so far no bibliographer has traced any of these early writings. Some poems, said to have been written by him in these days have been printed in the volume to which reference has already been made, \"Gay's Chair: Poems never before printed, written by John Gay.... With a Sketch of his Life from the MSS. of the Rev. Joseph Bailer, his nephew. Edited by Henry Lee ... 1820,\" but the authenticity of these cannot definitely be accepted. A chair, said to have been the property of Gay at Barnstaple, was sold early in the nineteenth century to Henry Lee, who sent it to be repaired. \"On taking out the drawer in front, which was somewhat broken,\" so runs the story, \"I found at the back part of the chair a concealed drawer, ingeniously fastened with a small wooden bolt;... it was full of manuscript papers, some of which appeared to have slipped over, as I found them stuck to the bottom or seat of the chair.\"[10] The poems in question are: \"The Ladies' Petition to the Honorable the House of Commons,\" the longest and most ambitious of the pieces; \"To Miss Jane Scott,\" \"Prediction,\" \"Comparisons,\" \"Absence,\" \"Fable,\" \"Congratulation to a Newly-married Pair,\" \"A Devonshire Hill,\" \"Letter to a Young Lady,\" and \"To My Chair.\" Of this small collection, Mr. John Underhill, who includes it in his admirable edition of Gay's poems in the \"Muses' Library,\" writes: \"The evidence in support of their authenticity is (1) the fact that they were found in a chair which was always spoken of by Gay's 'immediate descendants' as 'having been the property of the poet, and which, as his favourite easy chair, he highly valued'; and (2) that 'The Ladies' Petition' was printed nearly _verbatim_ from a manuscript in the handwriting of the poet ... If really Gay's, they [the verses] may, we think, a great many of them, be safely regarded as the production of his youth, written, perhaps, during the somewhat extended visit to Devonshire which preceded his introduction to the literary world of Pope. The least doubtful piece, 'The Ladies' Petition' was probably 'thrown off' upon the occasion of his visit to Exeter in 1715.\"  If the verses are genuine, they have such biographical interest as is afforded by an allusion to a youthful love-affair. There are lines \"To Miss Jane Scott\":--    The Welsh girl is pretty.      The English girl fair,   The Irish deem'd witty,      The French _d√©bonnaire_;    Though all may invite me,      I'd value them not;   The charms that delight me      I find in a SCOT.  It is presumedly to the same young lady he was referring in the verses written probably shortly after he returned to London after his visit to Devonshire:--                               ABSENCE.      Augustus, frowning, gave command.     And Ovid left his native land;     From Julia, as an exile sent.     He long with barb'rous Goths was pent.    So fortune frown'd on me, and I was driven   From friends, from home, from Jane, and happy Devon!   And Jane, sore grieved when from me torn away;--   loved her sorrow, though I wish'd her--GAY.  That another girl there was may be gathered from the \"Letter to a Young Lady,\" who was not so devoted as Jane Scott, for the poet writes:    Begging you will not mock his sighing.   And keep him thus whole years a-dying!   \"Whole years!\"--Excuse my freely speaking.   Such tortures, why a month--a week in?   Caress, or kill him quite in one day,   Obliging thus your servant, JOHN GAY.

When his brother, Jonathan, who had been promoted lieutenant at Cologne by Marlborough, under whom he served at Hochstadt and elsewhere, and captain by Queen Anne, committed suicide in 1709, after a quarrel with his colonel, John may have inherited some further share of the paternal estate.

Wine, woman, and song appealed to him. It is not on record that he had any love-affair, save those indicated in the verses in \"Gay's Chair\"; but the indelicacy of many passages in his writings suggests that he was rather intimately acquainted with the bagnios of the town. No man whose sense of decency had not been denied could possibly have written the verses \"To a Young Lady, with some Lamphreys,\" and this, even after making allowance for the freedom of the early eighteenth century. He certainly frequented the coffee-houses of Covent Garden and Pall Mall. Also, he roamed about the metropolis, and became learned in the highways and byways, north and south, and east and west--a knowledge which bore excellent fruit in \"Trivia.\"    But I, who ne'er was bless'd by Fortune's hand,   Nor brighten'd plough-shares in paternal land.   Long in the noisy town have been immured,   Respired its smoke, and all its cares endured.   Where news and politics divide mankind,   And schemes of state involve th' uneasy mind.[4]  Gay was then, as ever, a great eater. \"As the French philosopher used to prove his existence by _cogito, ergo sum_,\" Congreve wrote to Pope long after, \"the greatest proof of Gay's existence is _edit, ergo est_.\"[5] He ate in excess always, and not infrequently drank too much, and for exercise had no liking, though he was not averse from a ramble around London streets. As the years passed, he became fat, but found comfort in the fact that some of his intimates were yet more corpulent. To this, he made humorous reference in \"Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece\":--    And wondering Maine so fat, with laughing eyes,   (Gay, Maine and Cheney,[6] boon companions dear,   Gay fat, Maine fatter, and Cheney huge of size).  Gay had a passion for finery. To this foible Pope, in the early days of his acquaintance with the young man, made reference in a letter to Swift, December 8th, 1713: \"One Mr. Gay, an unhappy youth, who writes pastorals during the time of Divine Service, whose case is the more deplorable, as he hath miserably lavished away all that silver he should have reserved for his soul's health, in buttons and loops for his coat.\" Gay was not only well aware of this weakness, but he deplored it, though he could never contrive to overcome it. He made allusion to it in some lines known as the \"Epigrammatical Petition,\" addressed to Lord Oxford,[7] in June, 1714, and also in the prologue to \"The Shepherd's Week\":--    I sold my sheep and lambkins too,      For silver loops and garments blue:   My boxen hautboy sweet of sound,      For lace that edged mine hat around;   For Lightfoot and my scrip I got      A gorgeous sword, and eke a knot.  Gay now renewed his acquaintance with his old schoolfellow, Aaron Hill, who, it is said, though on doubtful authority, employed him as an amanuensis when setting on foot the project of answering questions in a paper, styled the _British Apollo, or, Curious Amusements for the Ingenious_.[8] The first number of this publication appeared on March 13th, 1708, and it was issued on Wednesdays and Fridays until March 16th, 1711. Gay referred to it in his pamphlet, \"The Present State of Wit,\" published in May 1711: \"Upon a review of my letter, I find I have quite forgotten the _British Apollo_, which might possibly have happened from its having of late retreated out of this end of the town into the country, where I am informed, however, that it still recommends itself by deciding wagers at cards and giving good advice to shopkeepers and their apprentices.\" Whether or no Gay ever contributed to the _British Apollo_, it seems likely that it was through the good offices of Hill that in May, 1708, Gay's poem, \"Wine,\" was published by William Keble at the Black-Spread-eagle in Westminster Hall, who, about the same time, brought out a translation by Nahum Tate, the Poet Laureate, and Hill, of a portion of the thirteenth book of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses.\"  \"Wine,\" a subject on which Gay, even at the age of twenty-two, could write with some authority, secured a sufficient popularity to be paid the doubtful compliment of piracy in 1709, by Henry Hill, of Blackfriars, on whom presently the author neatly revenged himself in his verses, \"On a Miscellany of Poems to Bernard Lintott,\" by the following reference:--    While neat old Elzevir is reckon'd better   Than Pirate Hill's brown sheets and scurvy letter.  This blank-verse poem, which may have been suggested by John Philips' \"Cider,\" published in 1708, is written in the mock-heroic strain, and although it has no particular value, shows some sense of humorous exaggeration, of which Gay was presently to show himself a master.    Of happiness terrestrial, and the source   Whence human pleasures flow, sing, Heavenly Muse,   Of sparkling juices, of th' enlivening grape,   Whose quick'ning taste adds vigour to the soul.   Whose sov'reign power revives decaying Nature,   And thaws the frozen blood of hoary age,   A kindly warmth diffusing--youthful fires   Gild his dim eyes, and paint with ruddy hue   His wrinkled visage, ghastly wan before--   Cordial restorative to mortal man,   With copious hand by bounteous gods bestow'd.  These are the opening lines. The concluding passage describing the tippling revellers leaving the tavern suggests, as has more than once been pointed out, the hand that afterwards wrote \"Trivia.\"    Thus we the winged hours in harmless mirth   And joys unsullied pass, till humid night   Has half her race perform'd; now all abroad   Is hush'd and silent, now the rumbling noise   Of coach or cart, or smoky link-boy's call   Is heard--but universal Silence reigns:   When we in merry plight, airy and gay.   Surprised to find the hours so swiftly fly.   With hasty knock, or twang of pendent cord.   Alarm the drowsy youth from slumb'ring nod;   Startled he flies, and stumbles o'er the stairs   Erroneous, and with busy knuckles plies   His yet clung eyelids, and with stagg'ring reel   Enters confused, and muttering asks our wills;   When we with liberal hand the score discharge,   And homeward each his course with steady step   Unerring steers, of cares and coin bereft.  So far as is known, Gay preserved a profound silence for three years after his publication of \"Wine,\" and then, on May 3rd, 1711, appeared from his pen, \"The Present State of Wit, in a Letter to a Friend in the Country,\" sold at the reasonable price of three-pence. This attracted the attention of Swift. \"Dr. Freind[9] ... pulled out a two-penny pamphlet just published, called 'The State of Wit', giving the characters of all the papers that have come out of late,\" he wrote in the \"Journal to Stella,\" May 12: \"The author seems to be a Whig, yet he speaks very highly of a paper called the _Examiner_, and says the supposed author of it is Dr. Swift. But, above all things, he praises the _Tatlers_ and _Spectators_, and I believe Steele and Addison were privy to the printing of it. Thus is one treated by the impudent dogs.\" In this unambitious little sketch, as the author puts it, he gives \"the histories and characters of all our periodical papers, whether monthly, weekly or diurnal,\" and it is, therefore, of value to the student of the early days of English journalism. He claimed to write without political bias: \"I shall only promise that, as you know, I never cared one farthing either for Whig or Tory, so I shall consider our writers purely as they are such, without any respect to which party they belong.\" In \"The Present State of Wit\" most of the better-known periodical writers are introduced. Dr. William King is mentioned, not he who was the Archbishop of Dublin, nor he who was the Principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, but he of whom it was said that he \"could write verses in a tavern three hours after he could not speak,\" who was the author of the \"Art of Cookery\" and the \"Art of Love,\" and who in 1709 had fluttered the scientific dovecotes by parodying the \"Philosophical Transactions\" in the _Useful Transactions in Philosophy and Other Sorts of Learning_, of which, however, only three numbers were issued. John Ozell was pilloried as the author of the _Monthly Amusement_, which was not, as the title suggests, a periodical, but was merely a title invented to summarise his frequent appearances in print. \"It is generally some French novel or play, indifferently translated, it is more or less taken notice of, as the original piece is more or less agreeable.\" Defoe takes his place in the gallery as the editor and principal contributor to the weekly _Poor Review_, that is, the _Weekly Review_ (which was published weekly from February 19th, 1704, until 1712) which, says Gay, \"is quite exhausted and grown so very contemptible, that though he has provoked all his brothers of the quill round, none of them will enter into a controversy with him.\"  The periodical publications of the day are passed under review: the _Observer_, founded in 1702 by John Tutchin, and after his death five years later, conducted by George Ridpath, editor of the _Flying Post_, until 1712, when it had almost entirely ceased to please, and was finally extinguished by the Stamp Tax; the weekly _Examiner_, set up in August, 1710, in opposition to the Whig _Taller_, numbering among its contributors Dr. King, St. John, Prior, Atterbury, and Freind, and managed by Swift from No. 14 (October 26th, 1710); the _Whig Examiner_, the first issue of which appeared on September 14th, 1710, its five numbers being written by Addison; the _Medley_, another Whig paper, which ran from August, 1710, to August, 1711, and was edited by Arthur Mainwaring, with the assistance of Steele, Oldmixon, and Anthony Henley (a wit and a man of fortune, to whom Garth dedicated \"The Dispensary,\" and who distinguished himself by describing Swift as \"a beast for ever after the order of Melchisedec\"). The _Tatter_, which appeared three times a week from April 12th, 1709, to January 2nd, 1711, was of course"]]]
