And now, back to the Mental Drill. After you have satisfied yourself that about everything that you are capable of thinking about is a \"not I\" thing--a tool and instrument for your use--you will ask, \"And now, what is there left that should not be thrown in the \"not I\" collection.\" To this question we answer \"THE 'I' ITSELF.\" And when you demand a proof we say, \"Try to set aside the 'I' for consideration!\" You may try from now until the passing away of infinities of infinities, and you will never be able to set aside the real \"I\" for consideration. You may think you can, but a little reflection will show you that you are merely setting aside some of your mental qualities or faculties. And in this process what is the \"I\" doing? Simply setting aside and considering things. Can you not see that the \"I\" cannot be both the _considerer_ and the thing considered--the _examiner_ and the thing examined? Can the sun shine upon itself by its own light? You may consider the \"I\" of some other person, but it is _your_ \"I\" that is considering. But you cannot, as an \"I,\" stand aside and see yourself as an \"I.\" Then what evidence have we that there is an \"I\" to us? This: that you are always conscious of being the considerer and examiner, instead of the considered and examined thing--and then, you have the evidence of your consciousness. And what report does this consciousness give us? Simply this, and nothing more: \"I AM.\" That is all that the \"I\" is conscious of, regarding its true self: \"I AM,\" but that consciousness is worth all the rest, for the rest is but \"not I\" tools that the \"I\" may reach out and use.  And so at the final analysis, you will find that there is something that refuses to be set aside and examined by the \"I.\" And that something is the \"I\" itself--that \"I\" eternal, unchangeable--that drop of the Great Spirit Ocean--that spark from the Sacred Flame.  Just as you find it impossible to imagine the \"I\" as dead, so will you find it impossible to set aside the \"I\" for consideration--all that comes to you is the testimony: \"I AM.\"  If you were able to set aside the \"I\" for consideration, who would be the one to consider it? Who could consider except the \"I\" itself, and if it be _here_, how could it be _there?_ The \"I\" cannot be the \"not I\" even in the wildest flights of the imagination--the imagination with all its boasted freedom and power, confesses itself vanquished when asked to do this thing.  Oh, students, may you be brought to a realization of what you are. May you soon awaken to the fact that you are sleeping gods--that you have within you the power of the Universe, awaiting your word to manifest in action. Long ages have you toiled to get this far, and long must you travel before you reach even the first Great Temple, but you are now entering into the conscious stage of Spiritual Evolution. No longer will your eyes be closed as you walk the Path. From now on you will begin to see clearer and clearer each step, in the dawning light of consciousness.  You are in touch with all of life, and the separation of your \"I\" from the great Universal \"I\" is but apparent and temporary. We will tell you of these things in our Third Lesson, but before you can grasp that you must develop the \"I\" consciousness within you. Do not lay aside this matter as one of no importance. Do not dismiss our weak explanation as being \"merely words, words, words,\" as so many are inclined to do. We are pointing out a great truth to you. Why not follow the leadings of the Spirit which even now--this moment while you read--is urging you to walk The Path of Attainment? Consider the teachings of this lesson, and practice the Mental Drill until your mind has grasped its significance, then let it sink deep down into your inner consciousness. Then will you be ready for the next lessons, and those to follow.  Practice this Mental Drill until you are fully assured of the _reality_ of the \"I\" and the _relativity_ of the \"not \"I\" in the mind. When you once grasp this truth, you will find that you will be able to use the mind with far greater power and effect, for you will recognize that it is your tool and instrument, fitted and intended to do your bidding. You will be able to master your moods, and emotions when necessary, and will rise from the position of a slave to a Master.  Our words seem cheap and poor, when we consider the greatness of the truth that we are endeavoring to convey by means of them. For who can find words to express the inexpressible? All that we may hope to do is to awaken a keen interest and attention on your part, so that you will practice the Mental Drill, and thus obtain the evidence of your own mentality to the truth. Truth is not truth to you until you have proven it in your own experience, and once so proven you cannot be robbed of it, nor can it be argued away from you.  You must realize that in every mental effort You--the \"I\"--are behind it. You bid the Mind work, and it obeys your Will. You are the Master, and not the slave of your mind. You are the Driver, not the driven. Shake yourself loose from the tyranny of the mind that has oppressed you for so long. Assert yourself, and be free. We will help you in this direction during the course of these lessons, but you must first assert yourself as a Master of your Mind. Sign the mental Declaration of Independence from your moods, emotions, and uncontrolled thoughts, and assert your Dominion over them. Enter into your Kingdom, thou manifestation of the Spirit!  While this lesson is intended primarily to bring clearly into your consciousness the fact that the \"I\" is a reality, separate and distinct from its Mental Tools, and while the control of the mental faculties by the Will forms a part of some of the future lessons, still, we think that this is a good place to point out to you the advantages arising from a realization of the true nature of the \"I\" and the relative aspect of the Mind.  Many of us have supposed that our minds were the masters of ourselves, and we have allowed ourselves to be tormented and worried by thoughts \"running away\" with us, and presenting themselves at inopportune moments. The Initiate is relieved from this annoyance, for he learns to assert his mastery over the different parts of the mind, and controls and regulates his mental processes, just as one would a fine piece of machinery. He is able to control his conscious thinking faculties, and direct their work to the best advantage, and he also learns how to pass on orders to the subconscious mental region and bid it work for him while he sleeps, or even when he is using his conscious mind in other matters. These subjects will be considered by us in due time, during the course of lessons.  In this connection it may be interesting to read what Edward Carpenter says of the power of the individual to control his thought processes. In his book \"_From Adam's Peak to Eleplumta_,\" in describing his experience while visiting a Hindu Gnani Yogi, he says:  \"And if we are unwilling to believe in this internal mastery over the body, we are perhaps almost equally unaccustomed to the idea of mastery over our own inner thoughts and feelings. That a man should be a prey to any thought that chances to take possession of his mind, is commonly among us assumed as unavoidable. It may be a matter of regret that he should be kept awake all night from anxiety as to the issue of a lawsuit on the morrow, but that he should have the power of determining whether he be kept awake or not seems an extravagant demand. The image of an impending calamity is no doubt odious, but its very odiousness (we say) makes it haunt the mind all the more pertinaciously and it is useless to try to expel it.  \"Yet this is an absurd position--for man, the heir of all the ages: hag-ridden by the flimsy creatures of his own brain. If a pebble in our boot torments us, we expel it. We take off the boot and shake it out. And once the matter is fairly understood it is just as easy to expel an intruding and obnoxious thought from the mind. About this there ought to be no mistake, no two opinions. The thing is obvious, clear and unmistakable. It should be as easy to expel an obnoxious thought from your mind as it is to shake a stone out of your shoe; and till a man can do that it is just nonsense to talk about his ascendancy over Nature, and all the rest of it. He is a mere slave, and prey to the bat-winged phantoms that flit through the corridors of his own brain.  \"Yet the weary and careworn faces that we meet by thousands, even among the affluent classes of civilization, testify only too clearly how seldom this mastery is obtained. How rare indeed to meet a _man_! How common rather to discover a creature hounded on by tyrant thoughts (or cares or desires), cowering, wincing under the lash--or perchance priding himself to run merrily in obedience to a driver that rattles the reins and persuades him that he is free--whom we cannot converse with in careless _tete-a-tete_ because that alien presence is always there, on the watch.  \"It is one of the most prominent doctrines of Raja Yoga that the power of expelling thoughts, or if need be, killing them dead on the spot, _must_ be attained. Naturally the art requires practice, but like other arts, when once acquired there is no mystery or difficulty about it. And it is worth practice. It may indeed fairly be said that life only begins when this art has been acquired. For obviously when instead of being ruled by individual thoughts, the whole flock of them in their immense multitude and variety and capacity is ours to direct and dispatch and employ where we list ('for He maketh the winds his messengers and the flaming fire His minister'), life becomes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],["title","A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#7)"],["body"," thing so vast and grand compared with what it was before, that its former condition may well appear almost antenatal.  \"If you can kill a thought dead, for the time being, you can do anything else with it that you please. And therefore it is that this power is so valuable. And it not only frees a man from mental torment (which is nine-tenths at least of the torment of life), but it gives him a concentrated power of handling mental work absolutely unknown to him before. The two things are co-relative to each other. As already said this is one of the principles of Raja Yoga.  \"While at work your thought is to be absolutely concentrated in it, undistracted by anything whatever irrelevant to the matter in hand--pounding away like a great engine, with giant power and perfect economy--no wear and tear of friction, or dislocation of parts owing to the working of different forces at the same time. Then when the work is finished, if there is no more occasion for the use of the machine, it must stop equally, absolutely--stop entirely--no _worrying_ (as if a parcel of boys were allowed to play their devilments with a locomotive as soon as it was in the shed)--and the man must retire into that region of his consciousness where his true self dwells.  \"I say the power of the thought-machine itself is enormously increased by this faculty of letting it alone on the one hand, and of using it singly and with concentration on the other. It becomes a true tool, which a master-workman lays down when done with, but which only a bungler carries about with him all the time to show that he is the possessor of it.\"  We ask the students to read carefully the above quotations from Mr. Carpenter's book, for they are full of suggestions that may be taken up to advantage by those who are emancipating themselves from their slavery to the unmastered mind, and who are now bringing the mind under control of the Ego, by means of the Will.  Our next lesson will take up the subject of the relationship of the \"I\" to the Universal \"I,\" and will be called the \"Expansion of the Self.\" It will deal with the subject, not from a theoretical standpoint, but from the position of the teacher who is endeavoring to make his students actually _aware_ in their consciousness of the truth of the proposition. In this course we are not trying to make our students past-masters of _theory_, but are endeavoring to place them in a position whereby they may _know_ for themselves, and actually experience the things of which we teach.  Therefore we urge upon you not to merely rest content with reading this lesson, but, instead, to study and meditate upon the teachings mentioned under the head of \"Mental Drill,\" until the distinctions stand out clearly in your mind, and until you not only _believe_ them to be true, but actually are _conscious_ of the \"I\" and its Mental Tools. Have patience and perseverance. The task may be difficult, but the reward is great. To become conscious of the greatness, majesty, strength and power of your real being is worth years of hard study. Do you not think so? Then study and practice hopefully, diligently and earnestly.  Peace be with you.   MANTRAMS (AFFIRMATIONS) FOR THE SECOND LESSON.  \"I\" am an entity--my mind is my instrument of expression.  \"I\" exist independent of my mind, and am not dependent upon it for existence or being.  \"I\" am Master of my mind, not its slave.  \"I\" can set aside my sensations, emotions, passions, desires, intellectual faculties, and all the rest of my mental collection of tools, as \"not I\" things--and still there remains something--and that something is \"I,\" which cannot be set aside by me, for it is my very self; my only self; my real self--\"I.\" That which remains after all that may be set aside _is_ set aside is the \"I\"--Myself--eternal, constant, unchangeable.  [Illustration: \"I am\"]     THE THIRD LESSON.  THE EXPANSION OF THE SELF.   In the first two lessons of this course we have endeavored to bring to the candidate a realization in consciousness of the reality of the \"I,\" and to enable him to distinguish between the Self and its sheaths, physical and mental. In the present lesson we will call his attention to the relationship of the \"I\" to the Universal \"I,\" and will endeavor to give him an idea of a greater, grander Self, transcending personality and the little self that we are so apt to regard as the \"I.\"  The keynote of this lesson will be \"The Oneness of All,\" and all of its teachings will be directed to awakening a realization in consciousness of that great truth. But we wish to impress upon the mind of the Candidate that we are _not_ teaching him that he is the Absolute. We are not teaching the \"I Am God\" belief, which we consider to be erroneous and misleading, and a perversion of the original Yogi teachings. This false teaching has taken possession of many of the Hindu teachers and people, and with its accompanying teaching of \"Maya\" or the complete illusion or non-existence of the Universe, has reduced millions of people to a passive, negative mental condition which undoubtedly is retarding their progress. Not only in India is this true, but the same facts may be observed among the pupils of the Western teachers who have embraced this negative side of the Oriental Philosophy. Such people confound the \"Absolute\" and \"Relative\" aspects of the One, and, being unable to reconcile the facts of Life and the Universe with their theories of \"I Am God,\" they are driven to the desperate expedient of boldly denying the Universe, and declaring it to be all \"an illusion\" or \"Maya.\"  You will have no trouble in distinguishing the pupils of the teachers holding this view. They will be found to exhibit the most negative mental condition--a natural result of absorbing the constant suggestion of \"nothingness\"--the gospel of negation. In marked contrast to the mental condition of the students, however, will be observed the mental attitude of the teachers, who are almost uniformly examples of vital, positive, mental force, capable of hurling their teaching into the minds of the pupils--of driving in their statements by the force of an awakened Will. The teacher, as a rule, has awakened to a sense of the \"I\" consciousness, and really develops the same by his \"I Am God\" attitude, because by holding this mental attitude he is enabled to throw off the influence of the sheaths of the lower mental principles, and the light of the Self shows forth fiercely and strongly, sometimes to such an extent that it fairly scorches the mentality of the less advanced pupil. But, notwithstanding this awakened \"I\" consciousness, the teacher is handicapped by his intellectual misconception and befogging metaphysics, and is unable to impart the \"I\" consciousness to his pupils, and, instead of raising them up to shine with equal splendor with himself, he really forces them into a shadow by reason of his teachings.  Our students, of course, will understand that the above is not written in the spirit of carping criticism or fault-finding. We hold no such mental attitude, and indeed could not if we remain true to our conception of Truth. We are mentioning these matters simply that the student may avoid this \"I Am God\" pitfall which awaits the Candidate just as he has well started on the Path. It would not be such a serious matter if it were merely a question of faulty metaphysics, for that would straighten itself out in time. But it is far more serious than this, for the teaching inevitably leads to the accompanying teaching that all is Illusion or _Maya_, and that Life is but a dream--a false thing--a lie--a nightmare; that the journey along the Path is but an illusion; that everything is \"nothing\"; that there is no soul; that You are God in disguise, and that He is fooling Himself in making believe that He is You; that Life is but a Divine masquerade or sleight-of-hand performance; that You are God, but that You (God) are fooling Yourself (God) in order to amuse Yourself (God). Is not this horrible? And yet it shows to what lengths the human mind will go before it will part with some pet theory of metaphysics with which it has been hypnotized. Do you think that we have overdrawn the picture? Then read some of the teachings of these schools of the Oriental Philosophy, or listen to some of the more radical of the Western teachers preaching this philosophy. The majority of the latter lack the courage of the Hindu teachers in carrying their theories to a logical conclusion, and, consequently they veil their teachings with metaphysical subtlety. But a few of them are more courageous, and come out into the open and preach their doctrine in full.  Some of the modern Western teachers of this philosophy explain matters by saying that \"God is masquerading as different forms of life, including Man, in order that he may gain the experience resulting therefrom, for although He has Infinite and Absolute Wisdom and Knowledge, he lacks the experience that comes only from actually living the life of the lowly forms, and therefore He descend thus in order to gain the needed experience.\" Can you imagine the Absolute, possessed of all possible Knowledge and Wisdom, feeling the need of such petty \"experience,\" and living the life of the lowly forms (including Man) in order \"to gain experience?\" To what Depths do these vain theories of Man drive us? Another leading Western teacher, who has absorbed the teaching of certain branches of the Oriental Philosophy, and who possesses the courage of his convictions, boldly announces that \"You, yourself, are the _totality_ of being, and with your mind alone create, preserve and destroy the universe, which is your own mental product.\" And again the last mentioned teacher states: \"the entire universe is a bagatelle illustration of your own creative power, which you are now exhibiting for your own inspection.\" \"By their fruits shall you know them,\" is a safe rule to apply to all teachings.
