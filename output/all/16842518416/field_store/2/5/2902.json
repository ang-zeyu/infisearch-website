You know very well, Richard, how miserable I should be to stay here in dependence upon Mr. Manning.\"  \"But to think that you, to whom the property rightfully belongs, should go away and work for a living, while that man and his boy occupy your place.

I don't need it, and you may.\"  Frank shook his head.  \"You are very kind, Richard, but I will get along with fifty dollars, unless Mr. Manning supplies me with more. If I really need money at any time, I will think of your offer.\"  \"That's something, at any rate,\" said Richard. partly reconciled. \"You won't forget it now, Mr. Frank?\"  \"No, Richard, I promise you.\"  Frank left the stable and went thoughtfully into the house.     CHAPTER IX  THE NEW OWNER OF AJAX   Frank and Mark took supper alone, Mr. Manning having left word that he would not return till later in the evening.  After supper, Frank decided to go over to call upon Col. Vincent, the new owner of Ajax. His estate was distant about three-quarters of a mile from the Cedars.  As Frank started, Mark inquired:  \"Where are you going, Frank?\"  \"To see Ajax,\" answered our hero.  \"Do you mean to make any fuss about him? I wouldn't advise you to.\"  \"Thank you for your advice.\"  \"I wonder what he is going to do?\" thought Mark. \"Of course he can't do anything now.\"  He did not venture to propose to accompany Frank, knowing that his company would not be acceptable.  \"Is Col. Vincent at home?\" asked Frank, at the door of a handsome house.  \"Yes, Mr. Courtney,\" replied the colored servant, pleasantly, for Frank was a favorite among all classes in the neighborhood. \"Come right in, sir. De colonel am smoking a cigar on de back piazza.\"  Frank followed the servant through the hall which intersected the house, and stepped out on the back piazza.  A stout, elderly gentleman was taking his ease in a large rustic rocking chair.  \"Good-evening, Col. Vincent,\" our hero said.  \"Good-evening, Frank, my boy,\" said the colonel, heartily. \"Glad to see you. Haven't you gone back to school?\"  \"Yes, sir; but I came home to spend Sunday. It doesn't seem much like home now,\" he added, as his lip quivered.  \"You have suffered a great loss, my dear boy,\" said the colonel, feelingly.  \"The greatest, sir. My mother was all I had.\"  \"I suppose Mr. Manning will keep up the establishment?\"  \"I suppose so, sir; but it is no longer home to me.\"  \"Don't take it too hard, Frank. I was sorry about the will.\"  \"So was I, sir; because it makes me dependent on a man whom I dislike.\"  \"Don't be too prejudiced, Frank. I never took any fancy to your stepfather myself; but then we don't need to like everybody we associate with.\"  \"I hear you have bought my horse, Col. Vincent,\" said Frank, desiring to change the subject.  \"Was Ajax your horse?\"  \"Yes. It was given to me as a birthday present by my mother.\"  \"I had some such idea, and expressly asked Mr. Manning whether the horse was not yours.\"  \"What did he answer?\"  \"That it was only nominally yours, and that he thought it best to sell it, as both you and Mark were absent at school, and had no time to use it.\"  \"I am not surprised at anything Mr. Manning may say,\" said Frank.  \"It's too bad! I'll tell you what I will do, Frank. I haven't paid for the horse yet. I will return it to Mr. Manning, and tell him that I bought it under a misapprehension of the ownership. I don't think he will make any fuss.\"  \"I would rather have you keep it, sir.\"  \"You would!\" exclaimed the colonel, in surprise.  \"Yes, sir. If you should return Ajax, Mr. Manning would sell him to some one else, and you, I know, will treat him well.\"  \"But you will lose the use of him. No, you won't, though. Come over to my stable when you like, and, if he is not in use, you can take him out.\"  \"Thank you, sir! You are very kind. While I am in the neighborhood, I won't forget your kind offer. But I mean to go away.\"  \"You mean to go away! Where?\"  \"Out into the world. Anywhere, where I can find work and make a living.\"  \"But surely this is not necessary. Your stepfather will provide for you without your working.\"  \"I have no reason to doubt it, Col. Vincent; but I shall be happier in the world outside.\"  \"Of course you will let Mr. Manning know of your intention to leave home?\"  \"I shall ask his permission to go at the end of my school term. That comes in a couple of weeks.\"  \"Where will you go?\"  \"A cousin of my father is at Newark, New Jersey. I think I shall go to him first, and ask his advice about getting a place either there or in New York.\"  \"You will need some money to start with. Do you think Mr. Manning will give you any?\"  \"I don't know, sir! That won't prevent my going. I have fifty dollars in a savings bank, saved up from my allowance, and that will be all I shall need.\"  \"If you have any difficulty on that score, Frank, remember that I was your father's friend, and mean to be yours. Apply to me at any time when you are in a strait.\"  \"I will, sir, and thank you heartily.\"  \"That was a strange will, Frank. I don't want to put any ideas into your head to disturb you, but had your mother ever led you to suspect that she intended to leave you dependent on your stepfather?\"  \"Never, sir!\"  \"Don't you think she would have done so, had she had such a plan in view?\"  \"I do,\" said Frank, quickly.  The colonel's eye met his, and each knew what the other suspected.  \"There is nothing for me to do at present, sir,\" said Frank. \"If Mr. Manning does not interfere with my plans, I shall not trouble him.\"  \"I will hint as much when I see him. It may clear the way for you.\"  \"I wish you would, sir.\"  \"Come and see me again, Frank,\" said the colonel, as Frank rose to go.  \"I certainly will, sir.\"  \"Your father's son will always be welcome at my house. When did you say your school term closes?\"  \"In a fortnight.\"  \"I will see your stepfather within a few days. By the way, Frank, wouldn't you like a gallop on Ajax to-night?\"  \"Yes, sir; I should enjoy it.\"  \"Come out to the stable with me, then.\"  Ajax whinnied with delight when he saw his old, or rather his young master, and evinced satisfaction when Frank stroked him caressingly.  \"Sam,\" said Col. Vincent, \"Frank is to ride Ajax whenever he pleases. Saddle him for his use whenever he asks you.\"  \"That I will, sir\" answered Sam. \"Often and often I've seen Mr. Frank on his back. Doesn't he ride well, though?\"  \"Don't flatter me, Sam,\" said Frank, laughing.  Five minutes later he was on the back of his favorite horse, galloping down the road.  \"I hope I shall meet Mark,\" thought Frank. \"I would like to give him a sensation.\"  Considering the manner in which Mark had treated his stepbrother, Frank may be excused for the wish to puzzle him a little.  Finding himself lonely, Mark decided to take a walk not long after Frank's departure. He was sauntering along the road, when he heard the sound of hoofs, and, to his surprise, saw his stepbrother on the back of Ajax.  His first thought was that Frank had gone to Col. Vincent's stable and brought away Ajax without permission, in defiance of Mr. Manning's will. He resolved to take him to task for it immediately. Frank purposely slackened the speed of his horse in order to give Mark the chance he sought.  \"Why are you riding Ajax?\" asked Mark.  \"It is a pleasant evening,\" answered Frank, \"and I thought I should enjoy it.\"  \"Where did you get him?\"  \"From Col. Vincent's stable, where he never ought to have been carried,\" answered Frank, with spirit.  \"You seem to think you can do anything you like, Frank Courtney,\" said Mark, provoked, deciding that his suspicions were well founded.  \"Is there any particular reason why I should not ride Ajax?\" demanded Frank.  \"You have made yourself liable to arrest for horse stealing,\" said Mark. \"It would serve you right if Col. Vincent should have you arrested and tried.\"  \"I don't think he will gratify your kind wishes, Mark.\"  \"Just wait and see what my father has to say to you.\"  \"I have only done what I had a perfect right to do; but I can't stop to dispute with you. I must finish my ride. Hey, Ajax!\"  As he spoke the horse dashed into a gallop, and Mark was left looking after him in a disturbed frame of mind.  \"I'll tell my father as soon as he gets home,\" he decided; and he kept his word.  In consequence, Frank, by that time returned, was summoned into Mr. Manning's presence.  \"What is this I hear?\" he began. \"Did you ride Ajax this evening?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Where did you find him?\"  \"In Col. Vincent's stable.\"  \"This is a high-handed proceeding, Frank Courtney. Have you any excuse to offer?\"  \"None is needed sir. Col. Vincent has given me permission to ride him whenever I please.\"  \"It appears to me, Mark,\" said Mr. Manning, sharply, \"that you have made a fool of yourself.\"  \"How should I know?\" replied Mark, mortified by the collapse of his sensation. \"Frank didn't tell me he had leave to use the horse.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13803"],["title","Making His Way; Or, Frank Courtney's Struggle Upward (#6)"],["body"," he left the room, looking foolish.     CHAPTER X  MARK YIELDS TO TEMPTATION   There are some boys, as well as men, who cannot stand prosperity.  It appeared that Mark Manning was one of these.  While his stepmother was living and his father's prospects--and consequently his own--were uncertain, he had been circumspect in his behavior and indulged in nothing that could be considered seriously wrong.  When his father came into possession of a large fortune, and his pocket money was doubled, Mark began to throw off some of the restraint which, from motives of prudence, he had put upon himself.  About the middle of the week, as Frank was taking a walk after school hours, he was considerably surprised to see Mark come out of a well-known liquor saloon frequented by men and boys of intemperate habits.  The students of Bridgeville Academy were strictly forbidden this or any other saloon, and I am sure that my boy readers will agree with mo that this rule was a very proper one.  Mark Manning appeared to have been drinking. His face was flushed, and his breath, if one came near enough to him, was redolent of the fumes of alcohol. With him was James Carson, one of the poorest scholars and most unprincipled boys in the academy. It was rather surprising that he had managed for so long to retain his position in the institution, but he was crafty and took good care not to be caught.  To go back a little, it was chiefly owing to James Carson's influence that Mark had entered the saloon.  When he learned that Mark's worldly prospects had improved, and that he had a large supply of pocket money, he determined to cultivate his acquaintance--though privately he thought Mark a disagreeable boy--with the intention of obtaining for himself a portion of Mark's surplus means.  At the first of the term he had made similar advances to Frank, but they were coldly received, so much so that he did not think it worth while to persevere in courting our hero's intimacy.  He succeeded better with Mark, his crafty nature teaching him how to approach him.  \"Mark,\" he said, with a great show of cordiality, \"I am delighted to hear of your good fortune. I always liked you, and I think you deserve to be rich.\"  \"Thank you!\" said Mark, much gratified, for he liked flattery. \"I am sure I am very much obliged to you.\"  \"Oh, not at all! I only say what I think. Shall I tell you why I am particularly glad?\"  \"Yes, if you like,\" returned Mark, in some curiosity.  \"Because I like you better than that young muff, your stepbrother. I hope you won't be offended at my plain speaking,\" he added, artfully.  \"Certainly not!\" said Mark.  \"I suppose,\" said James, \"you will see a little life now that you are your own master and have plenty of money.\"  \"I don't know exactly what you mean, James. There isn't much life to be seen in Bridgeville.\"  \"That is true; but still there is some. Suppose now\"--by this time they were in front of the saloon, which, besides a bar, contained a billiard and pool table--\"suppose now we go in and have a game of billiards.\"  \"It's against the rules, isn't it?\" asked Mark.  \"What do you care for the rules?\" said James, contemptuously.  \"If the old man hears of it, we shall get into hot water.\"  By the \"old man\" Mark meant the Rev. Dr. Brush, the venerable and respected principal of the Bridgeville Academy, but such boys as he have very little respect for the constituted authorities.  \"Why need he know it? We will slip in when no one is looking. Did you ever play a game of billiards?\"  \"I never played over half a dozen games in my life.\"  \"Yon ought to know how to play. It is a splendid game. Come in.\"  Mark did not make very strong opposition, and the two boys, first looking cautiously in different directions, entered the saloon.  Toward the entrance was a bar, and in the roar of the saloon were two tables.  \"Won't you have a drink, Mark?\" asked James.  Mark hesitated.  \"Oh, come now, it won't hurt. Two glasses of whisky, John.\"  \"All right, Mr. Carson,\" said the barkeeper, to whom James was well known.  James tossed off his glass with the air of an old drinker, but Mark drank his more slowly.  \"There, I know you feel better, Mark.\"  \"Now, John, give me the balls. We'll play a game of billiards.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  \"I'll discount you, Mark,\" said James, \"to give you a fair chance. It is about the same thing as giving you half the game. Or, if you like, I will give you seventeen points to start with, and then you will only have seventeen to make, while I am making thirty-four.\"  \"I like that best.\"  \"Now shall we play for the drinks?\"  \"We have just had a drink?\"  \"We'll have another.\"  \"Won't that be too much? I don't want to get drunk.\"  \"Two drinks won't do you any harm. Very well. Now let us string for the lead.\"  There is no need of describing the game in detail. Mark was only a novice, while James could really make three or four points to his one. He restrained himself, however, so that he only beat Mark by two points.  \"You did splendidly, Mark,\" he said. \"Considering how little you have played, you did remarkably well. Why, you made a run of three.\"  \"Yes, I did pretty well,\" said Mark, flattered by his companion's praises.  \"I had hard work to beat you, I can tell you that. As it was, you came within two points of beating. Don't you like the game?\"  \"Very much.\"  \"I thought you would. Shall we have another game?\"  \"I don't mind,\" answered Mark.  He knew that he ought to be in his room writing a composition to be delivered the next day, but such obligations sat easily upon Mark, and he did not hesitate long.  That time James allowed him to score sixteen, so that Mark was only beaten by one point.  \"You see, you are improving,\" said James. \"I played a better game that time than before, and still you came within one of beating me.\"  \"I think I shall become a good player in time,\" said Mark, complacently.  \"Yes, and in a very short time. Now,\" said James, \"I have a proposal to make to you.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"We'll bet twenty-five cents on the next game, to give a little interest to it.\"  Mark had no special scruples against betting, which is only one form of gambling, but he decidedly objected to losing money, so he answered, cautiously:  \"I don't know about that. You beat me both of the other games.\"  \"That's true; but you play better now than you did at first.\"  \"That may be so.\"  \"What are twenty-five cents, anyway? I expect to lose it, but it will increase the interest of the game.\"  So Mark was persuaded, and the game was played.  James Carson managed to let Mark beat him by five shots, and the latter was correspondingly elated.  \"You beat me after all,\" said James, pretending to be much disappointed, \"and by five points. I'll tell you what I'll do--I'll give you the same odds, and bet a dollar on the game. I suppose it's foolish, but I'll risk it!\"  \"Done!\" said Mark, eagerly.  His cupidity was excited, and he felt sure of winning the dollar, as he had the twenty-five cents. But James had no idea of playing off now, and he played a better game, as he was well able to do. The result was that Mark was beaten by three points.  He looked quite crestfallen.  \"I had better shows than you,\" said James. \"I couldn't do it once in five times. Will you play again?\"  Mark agreed to it with some hesitation, and he was again beaten.  \"You had luck against you. Another day you will succeed better. Have you played enough?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Mark, annoyed.  He had four games to pay for and two dollars in bets, and it made rather an expensive afternoon.  \"Have another drink? I'll treat,\" said James, who could afford to be liberal.  Mark accepted, and then, flushed and excited, he left the saloon, just as Frank came up, as described in the first part of the chapter. On the whole, he was sorry to meet his stepbrother just at this time.  Frank stopped, and his attention was drawn to Mark's flushed face.     CHAPTER XI  MARK GETS INTO TROUBLE   Mark nodded slightly and was about to pass without a word, when Frank said, quietly:  \"I am sorry to see you coming out of such a place, Mark.\"  \"What is it to you, anyway?\" returned Mark, rudely.  \"Not much, perhaps,\" replied Frank, calmly, \"but I don't like to see my acquaintances coming out of a liquor saloon.\"  \"It won't hurt you,\" said Mark, irritably.  \"No, it won't hurt me, but if tho principal should hear of it, it would not be pleasant for you. You know students are strictly forbidden to enter any saloon?\"  \"I suppose you mean to tell on me,\" said Mark, hastily, and not altogether without uneasiness.  \"You are mistaken. I am not a talebearer.\"  \"Then there is no need to say any more about it. Come along, James!\"  Frank's interference was well meant, but, as we shall see, it did harm rather than good.  As Mark left the saloon, he had half decided not to enter it again. He was three dollars out of pocket, and this did not suit him at all.  In fact, Mark was rather a mean boy, and it was with considerable reluctance that he had handed over to his companion the two dollars with which to pay for the games.  Moreover, he was mortified at losing the two games of billiards, when so great odds had been given him.  James Carson was no scholar, but he was sharp enough to perceive the state of Mark's feelings, and he also saw how he was affected by Frank's remonstrance.  He decided to take advantage of this, and strengthen his hold on Mark.  \"Well, Mark,\" he said, \"I suppose you'll give up playing billiards now.\"  \"Why should I?\"  \"Because your stepbrother doesn't approve of it. You won't dare to go into the saloon after he has forbidden you,\" he continued, with a sneer.  \"What do you mean, James? Do you suppose I care that\"--snapping his fingers--\"for what Frank says, or even thinks, either?\"  \"I didn't know but you might stand in fear of him.\"  \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Mark, hotly.  \"Insult you! My dear friend, what can you be thinking of? Why, I like you ten times as much as that muff, Frank"]]]
