He investigated 732 successive confinements     at the Clinique Baudelocque in Paris. He found that 137 women     engaged in fatiguing occupations (servants, cooks, etc.) and not     resting during pregnancy, produced children with an average     weight of 3,081 grammes; 115 women engaged in only slightly     fatiguing occupations (dressmakers, milliners, etc.) and also not     resting during pregnancy, had children with an average weight of     3,130 grammes, a slight but significant difference, in view of     the fact that the women of the first group were large and robust,     while those of the second group were of slight and elegant build.     Again, comparing groups of women who rested during pregnancy, it     was found that the women accustomed to fatiguing work had     children with an average weight of 3,319 grammes, while those     accustomed to less fatiguing work had children with an average     weight of 3,318 grammes. The difference between repose and     non-repose is thus considerable, while it also enables robust     women exercising a fatiguing occupation to catch up, though not     to surpass, the frailer women exercising a less fatiguing     occupation. We see, too, that even in the comparatively     unfatiguing occupations of milliners, etc., rest during pregnancy     still remains important, and cannot safely be dispensed with.     \"Society,\" Letourneux concludes, \"must guarantee rest to women     not well off during a part of pregnancy. It will be repaid the     cost of doing so by the increased vigor of the children thus     produced\" (Letourneux, _De l'Influence de la Profession de la     Mère sur le Poids de l'Enfant_, Thèse de Paris, 1897).      Dr. Dweira-Bernson (_Revue Pratique d'Obstétrique et de     Pédiatrie_, 1903, p. 370), compared four groups of pregnant women     (servants with light work, servants with heavy work, farm girls,     dressmakers) who rested for three months before confinement with     four groups similarly composed who took no rest before     confinement. In every group he found that the difference in the     average weight of the child was markedly in favor of the women     who rested, and it was notable that the greatest difference was     found in the case of the farm girls who were probably the most     robust and also the hardest worked.      The usual time of gestation ranges between 274 and 280 days (or     280 to 290 days from the last menstrual period), and occasionally     a few days longer, though there is dispute as to the length of     the extreme limit, which some authorities would extend to 300     days, or even to 320 days (Pinard, in Richet's _Dictionnaire de     Physiologie_, vol. vii, pp. 150-162; Taylor, _Medical     Jurisprudence_, fifth edition, pp. 44, 98 et seq.; L.M. Allen,     \"Prolonged Gestation,\" _American Journal Obstetrics_, April,     1907). It is possible, as Müller suggested in 1898 in a Thèse de     Nancy, that civilization tends to shorten the period of     gestation, and that in earlier ages it was longer than it is now.     Such a tendency to premature birth under the exciting nervous     influences of civilization would thus correspond, as Bouchacourt     has pointed out (_La Grossesse_, p. 113), to the similar effect     of domestication in animals. The robust countrywoman becomes     transformed into the more graceful, but also more fragile, town     woman who needs a degree of care and hygiene which the     countrywoman with her more resistant nervous system can to some     extent dispense with, although even she, as we see, suffers in     the person of her child, and probably in her own person, from the     effects of work during pregnancy. The serious nature of this     civilized tendency to premature birth--of which lack of rest in     pregnancy is, however, only one of several important causes--is     shown by the fact that Séropian (_Fréquence Comparée des Causes     de l'Accouchement Prémature_, Thèse de Paris, 1907) found that     about one-third of French births (32.28 per cent.) are to a     greater or less extent premature. Pregnancy is not a morbid     condition; on the contrary, a pregnant woman is at the climax of     her most normal physiological life, but owing to the tension thus     involved she is specially liable to suffer from any slight shock     or strain.      It must be remarked that the increased tendency to premature     birth, while in part it may be due to general tendencies of     civilization, is also in part due to very definite and     preventable causes. Syphilis, alcoholism, and attempts to produce     abortion are among the not uncommon causes of premature birth     (see, e.g., G.F. McCleary, \"The Influence of Antenatal Conditions     on Infantile Mortality,\" _British Medical Journal_, Aug. 13,     1904).      Premature birth ought to be avoided, because the child born too     early is insufficiently equipped for the task before him.     Astengo, dealing with nearly 19,000 cases at the Lariboisière     Hospital in Paris and the Maternité, found, that reckoning from     the date of the last menstruation, there is a direct relation     between the weight of the infant at birth and the length of the     pregnancy. The longer the pregnancy, the finer the child     (Astengo, _Rapport du Poids des Enfants à la Durée de la     Grossesse_, Thèse de Paris, 1905).      The frequency of premature birth is probably as great in England     as in France. Ballantyne states (_Manual of Antenatal Pathology;     The Foetus_, p. 456) that for practical purposes the frequency     of premature labors in maternity hospitals may be put at 20 per     cent., but that if all infants weighing less than 3,000 grammes     are to be regarded as premature, it rises to 41.5 per cent. That     premature birth is increasing in England seems to be indicated by     the fact that during the past twenty-five years there has been a     steady rise in the mortality rate from premature birth. McCleary,     who discusses this point and considers the increase real,     concludes that \"it would appear that there has been a diminution     in the quality as well as in the quantity of our output of     babies\" (see also a discussion, introduced by Dawson Williams, on     \"Physical Deterioration,\" _British Medical Journal_, Oct. 14,     1905).      It need scarcely be pointed out that not only is immaturity a     cause of deterioration in the infants that survive, but that it     alone serves enormously to decrease the number of infants that     are able to survive. Thus G. Newman states (loc. cit.) that in     most large English urban districts immaturity is the chief cause     of infant mortality, furnishing about 30 per cent. of the infant     deaths; even in London (Islington) Alfred Harris (_British     Medical Journal_, Dec. 14, 1907) finds that it is responsible for     nearly 17 per cent. of the infantile deaths. It is estimated by     Newman that about half of the mothers of infants dying of     immaturity suffer from marked ill-health and poor physique; they     are not, therefore, fitted to be mothers.      Rest during pregnancy is a very powerful agent in preventing     premature birth. Thus Dr. Sarraute-Lourié has compared 1,550     pregnant women at the Asile Michelet who rested before     confinement with 1,550 women confined at the Hôpital Lariboisière     who had enjoyed no such period of rest. She found that the     average duration of pregnancy was at least twenty days shorter in     the latter group (Mme. Sarraute-Lourié, _De l'Influence du Repos     sur la Durée de la Gestation_, Thèse de Paris, 1899).      Leyboff has insisted on the absolute necessity of rest during     pregnancy, as well for the sake of the woman herself as the     burden she carries, and shows the evil results which follow when     rest is neglected. Railway traveling, horse-riding, bicycling,     and sea-voyages are also, Leyboff believes, liable to be     injurious to the course of pregnancy. Leyboff recognizes the     difficulties which procreating women are placed under by present     industrial conditions, and concludes that \"it is urgently     necessary to prevent women, by law, from working during the last     three months of pregnancy; that in every district there should be     a maternity fund; that during this enforced rest a woman should     receive the same salary as during work.\" He adds that the     children of unmarried mothers should be cared for by the State,     that there should be an eight-hours' day for all workers, and     that no children under sixteen should be allowed to work (E.     Leyboff, _L'Hygiène de la Grossesse_, Thèse de Paris, 1905).      Perruc states that at least two months' rest before confinement     should be made compulsory, and that during this period the woman     should receive an indemnity regulated by the State. He is of     opinion that it should take the form of compulsory assurance, to     which the worker, the employer, and the State alike contributed     (Perruc, _Assistance aux Femmes Enceintes_, Thèse de Paris,     1905).      It is probable that during the earlier months of pregnancy, work,     if not excessively heavy and exhausting, has little or no bad     effect; thus Bacchimont (_Documents pour servir a l'Histoire de     la Puériculture Intra-utérine_, Thèse de Paris, 1898) found that,     while there was a great gain in the weight of children of mothers     who had rested for three months, there was no corresponding gain     in the children of those mothers who had rested for longer     periods. It is during the last three months that freedom, repose,     the cessation of the obligatory routine of employment become     necessary. This is the opinion of Pinard, the chief authority on     this matter. Many, however, fearing that economic and industrial     conditions render so long a period of rest too difficult of     practical attainment, are, with Clappier and G. Newman,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#5)"],["body","to demand two months as a minimum; Salvat only asks for one     month's rest before confinement, the woman, whether married or     not, receiving a pecuniary indemnity during this period, with     medical care and drugs free. Ballantyne (_Manual of Antenatal     Pathology: The Foetus_, p. 475), as well as Niven, also asks only     for one month's compulsory rest during pregnancy, with indemnity.     Arthur Helme, however, taking a more comprehensive view of all     the factors involved, concludes in a valuable paper on \"The     Unborn Child: Its Care and Its Rights\" (_British Medical     Journal_, Aug. 24, 1907), \"The important thing would be to     prohibit pregnant women from going to work at all, and it is as     important from the standpoint of the child that this prohibition     should include the early as the late months of pregnancy.\"      In England little progress has yet been made as regards this     question of rest during pregnancy, even as regards the education     of public opinion. Sir William Sinclair, Professor of Obstetrics     at the Victoria University of Manchester, has published (1907) _A     Plea for Establishing Municipal Maternity Homes_. Ballantyne, a     great British authority on the embryology of the child, has     published a \"Plea for a Pre-Maternity Hospital\" (_British Medical     Journal_, April 6, 1901), has since given an important lecture on     the subject (_British Medical Journal_, Jan. 11, 1908), and has     further discussed the matter in his _Manual of Ante-Natal     Pathology: The Foetus_ (Ch. XXVII); he is, however, more     interested in the establishment of hospitals for the diseases of     pregnancy than in the wider and more fundamental question of rest     for all pregnant women. In England there are, indeed, a few     institutions which receive unmarried women, with a record of good     conduct, who are pregnant for the first time, for, as     Bouchacourt remarks, ancient British prejudices are opposed to     any mercy being shown to women who are recidivists in committing     the crime of conception.      At present, indeed, it is only in France that the urgent need of     rest during the latter months of pregnancy has been clearly     realized, and any serious and official attempts made to provide     for it. In an interesting Paris thesis (_De la Puériculture avant     le Naissance_, 1907) Clappier has brought together much     information bearing on the efforts now being made to deal     practically with this question. There are many _Asiles_ in Paris     for pregnant women. One of the best is the Asile Michelet,     founded in 1893 by the Assistance Publique de Paris. This is a     sanatorium for pregnant women who have reached a period of seven     and a half months. It is nominally restricted to the admission of     French women who have been domiciled for a year in Paris, but, in     practice, it appears that women from all parts of France are     received. They are employed in light and occasional work for the     institution, being paid for this work, and are also occupied in     making clothes for the expected baby. Married and unmarried women     are admitted alike, all women being equal from the point of view     of motherhood, and indeed the majority of the women who come to     the Asile Michelet are unmarried, some being girls who have even     trudged on foot from Brittany and other remote parts of France,     to seek concealment from their friends in the hospitable     seclusion of these refuges in the great city. It is not the least     advantage of these institutions that they shield unmarried     mothers and their offspring from the manifold evils to which they     are exposed, and thus tend to decrease crime and suffering. In     addition to the maternity refuges, there are institutions in     France for assisting with help and advice those pregnant women     who prefer to remain at home, but are thus enabled to avoid the     necessity for undue domestic labor.      There ought to be no manner of doubt that when, as is the case     to-day in our own and some other supposedly civilized countries,     motherhood outside marriage is accounted as almost a crime, there     is the very greatest need for adequate provision for unmarried     women who are about to become mothers, enabling them to receive     shelter and care in secrecy, and to preserve their self-respect     and social position. This is necessary not only in the interests     of humanity and public economy, but also, as is too often     forgotten, in the interests of morality, for it is certain that     by the neglect to furnish adequate provision of this nature women     are driven to infanticide and prostitution. In earlier, more     humane days, the general provision for the secret reception and     care of illegitimate infants was undoubtedly most beneficial. The     suppression of the mediæval method, which in France took place     gradually between 1833 and 1862, led to a great increase in     infanticide and abortion, and was a direct encouragement to crime     and immorality. In 1887 the Conseil Général of the Seine sought     to replace the prevailing neglect of this matter by the adoption     of more enlightened ideas and founded a _bureau secret     d'admission_ for pregnant women. Since then both the abandonment     of infants and infanticide have greatly diminished, though they     are increasing in those parts of France which possess no     facilities of this kind. It is widely held that the State should     unify the arrangements for assuring secret maternity, and should,     in its own interests, undertake the expense. In 1904 French law     ensured the protection of unmarried mothers by guaranteeing their     secret, but it failed to organize the general establishment of     secret maternities, and has left to doctors the pioneering part     in this great and humane public work (A. Maillard-Brune,     _Refuges, Maternités, Bureaux d'Admission Secrets, comme Moyens     Préservatives des Infanticide_, Thèse de Paris, 1908). It is not     among the least benefits of the falling birth rate that it has     helped to stimulate this beneficent movement.  The development of an industrial system which subordinates the human body and the human soul to the thirst for gold, has, for a time, dismissed from social consideration the interests of the race and even of the individual, but it must be remembered that this has not been always and everywhere so. Although in some parts of the world the women of savage peoples work up to the time of confinement, it must be remarked that the conditions of work in savage life do not resemble the strenuous and continuous labor of modern factories. In many parts of the world, however, women are not allowed to work hard during pregnancy and every consideration is shown to them. This is so, for instance, among the Pueblo Indians, and among the Indians of Mexico. Similar care is taken in the Carolines and the Gilbert Islands and in many other regions all over the world. In some places, women are secluded during pregnancy, and in others are compelled to observe many more or less excellent rules. It is true that the assigned cause for these rules is frequently the fear of evil spirits, but they nevertheless often preserve a hygienic value. In many parts of the world the discovery of pregnancy is the sign for a festival of more or less ritual character, and much good advice is given to the expectant mother. The modern Musselmans are careful to guard the health of their women when pregnant, and so are the Chinese.[6] Even in Europe, in the thirteenth century, as Clappier notes, industrial corporations sometimes had regard to this matter, and would not allow women to work during pregnancy. In Iceland, where much of the primitive life of Scandinavian Europe is still preserved, great precautions are taken with pregnant women. They must lead a quiet life, avoid tight garments, be moderate in eating and drinking, take no alcohol, be safeguarded from all shocks, while their husbands and all others who surround them must treat them with consideration, save them from worry and always bear with them patiently.[7]  It is necessary to emphasize this point because we have to realize that the modern movement for surrounding the pregnant woman with tenderness and care, so far from being the mere outcome of civilized softness and degeneracy, is, in all probability, the return on a higher plane to the sane practice of those races which laid the foundations of human greatness.  While rest is the cardinal virtue imposed on a woman during the later months of pregnancy, there are other points in her regimen that are far from unimportant in their bearing on the fate of the child. One of these is the question of the mother's use of alcohol. Undoubtedly alcohol has been a cause of much fanaticism. But the declamatory extravagance of anti-alcoholists must not blind us to the fact that the evils of alcohol are real. On the reproductive process especially, on the mammary glands, and on the child, alcohol has an arresting and degenerative influence without any compensatory advantages. It has been proved by experiments on animals and observations on the human subject that alcohol taken by the pregnant woman passes freely from the maternal circulation to the foetal circulation. Féré has further shown that, by injecting alcohol and aldehydes into hen's eggs during incubation, it is possible to cause arrest of development and malformation in the chick.[8] The woman who is bearing her child in her womb or suckling it at her breast would do well to remember that the alcohol which may be harmless to herself is little better than poison to the immature being who derives nourishment from her blood. She should confine herself to the very lightest of alcoholic beverages in very moderate amounts and would do better still to abandon these entirely and drink milk instead. She is "]]]
