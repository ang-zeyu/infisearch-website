There may be _anything_ that is wonderful and mysterious. Get busy, Uncle Peter, and get your outfit together; you've boasted that a roundup can beat the army in getting under way quickly, now let us have a practical demonstration. We want to start by six o'clock--all of us, with a cook and four or five men to do the excavating. Bring it to pass!\" It was the voice of the girl whom her friends spoke of as \"The life of the party;\" the voice of the-girl-who-does-things.  \"It's sixty-five miles from here, good and strong--and mostly up and down,\" put in Andy.  \"'Quoth the raven,'\" mocked the-girl-who-does-things. \"We are prepared to face the ups-and-downs. Do we start at six, Uncle Peter?\"  Uncle Peter glanced sideways at the roundup boss. To bring it to pass, he would be obliged to impress the roundup cook and part of the crew. It was breaking an unwritten law of the rangeland, and worse, it was doing something unbusiness-like and foolish. But not even the owner of the Rocking R may withstand the pleading of a pretty woman. Uncle Peter squirmed, but he promised:  \"We start at six; earlier if you say so.\"  The roundup boss gave his employer a look of disgust and walked away; the crew took it that he went off to some secluded place to swear.  Thereafter there was much discussion of ways and means, and much enthusiasm among the visitors from the East--equalled by the depression of the crew, for cowboys do not, as a rule, take kindly to pick and shovel, and the excavators had not yet been chosen from among them. They were uneasy, and they stole frequent, betraying glances at one another. All of which amused Pink much. Pink would like to have gone along, and would certainly have offered his services, but for the fact that his work there was done and he would have to start back to the Flying U just as soon as one of his best saddle horses, which had stepped on a broken beer bottle and cut its foot, was able to travel. That would be in a few days, probably. So Pink sighed and watched the preparations enviously.  Since he was fairly committed into breaking all precedents, uncle Peter plunged recklessly. He ordered the mess-wagon to be restocked and prepared for the trip, and he took the bed-tent and half the crew. The foreman he wisely left behind with the remnant of his outfit. They were all to eat at the house while the mess-wagon was away, and they were to spread their soogans--which is to say beds--where they might, if the bunk-house proved too small or too hot.  The foreman, outraged beyond words, saddled at daybreak and rode to the nearest town, and the unchosen half turned out in a body to watch the departure of the explorers, which speaks eloquently of their interest; for cowboys off duty are prone to sleep long.  Andy, as guide, bolted ahead of the party that he might open the gate. Bolted is a good word, for his horse swerved and kept on running, swerved again, and came down in a heap. Andy did not get up, and the women screamed. Then Pink and some others hurried out and bore Andy, groaning, to the bunk-house.  The visitors from the East gathered, perturbed, around the door, sympathetic and dismayed. It looked very much as if their exploration must end where it began, and the-girl-who-does-things looked about to weep, until Andy, still groaning, sent Pink out to comfort them.  \"He says you needn't give up the trip on his account,\" Pink announced musically from the doorway. \"He's drawing a map and marking the coulee where the ruin is. He says most any of the boys that know the country at all can find the place for yuh. And he isn't hurt permanent; he strained his back so he can't ride, is all.\" Pink dimpled at the young old lady who was admiring him frankly, and withdrew.  Inside, Andy Green was making pencil marks and giving the chosen half explicit directions. At last he folded the paper and handed it to one called Sandy.  \"That's the best I can do for yuh,\" he finished. \"I don't see how yuh can miss it if yuh follow that map close. And if them gay females make any kick on the trail, you just remind 'em that I said all along it was rough going. So long, and good luck.\"  So with high-keyed, feminine laughter and much dust, passed the exploring party from the Rocking R.  \"Say,\" Pink began two days later to Andy, who was sitting on the shady side of the bunk-house staring absently at the skyline, \"There's a word uh praise I've been aiming to give yuh. I've seen riding, and I've done a trifle in that line myself, and learned some uh the tricks. But I want to say I never did see a man flop his horse any neater than you done that morning. I'll bet there ain't another man in the outfit got next your play. I couldn't uh done it better myself. Where did you learn that? Ever ride in Wyoming?\"  Andy turned his eyes, but not his head--which was a way he had--and regarded Pink slantwise for at least ten seconds. \"Yes, I've rode in Wyoming,\" he answered quietly. Then: \"What's the chance for a job, up your way? Is the Flying U open for good men and true?\"  \"It won't cost yuh a cent to try,\" Pink told him. \"How's your back? Think you'll be able to ride by the time Skeeker is able to travel?\"  Andy, grinned. \"Say,\" he confided suddenly, \"if that hoss don't improve some speedy, I'll be riding on ahead. I reckon I'll be able to travel before them explorers get back, my friend.\"  \"Why?\" dimpled Pink boldly.  \"Why? Well, the going is some rough, down that way. If they get them wagons half way to the coulee marked with a cross, they'll sure have to attach wings onto 'em. I've been some worried about that. I don't much believe uncle Peter is going to enjoy that trip--and he sure does get irritable by spells. I've got a notion to ride for some other outfit, this summer.\"  \"Was that the reason you throwed your horse down and got hurt, that morning?\" questioned Pink, and Andy grinned again by way of reply.  \"They'll be gone a week, best they can do,\" he estimated aloud. \"We ought to be able to make our getaway by then, easy.\"  Pink assured him that a week would see them headed for the Flying U.  It was the evening of the sixth day, and the two were packed and ready to leave in the morning, when Andy broke off humming and gave a snort of dismay. \"By gracious, there they come. My mother lives in Buffalo, Pink, in a little drab house with white trimmings. Write and tell her how her son--Oh, beloved! but they're hitting her up lively. If they made the whole trip in that there frame uh mind, they could uh gone clean to Miles City and back. How pretty the birds sing! Pink, you'll hear words, directly.\"  Directly Pink did.  \"You're the biggest liar on earth,\" Sherwood Branciforte contributed to the recriminating wave that near engulfed Andy Green. \"You sent us down there on a wild-goose chase, you brute. You--\"  \"I never sent nobody,\" Andy defended. \"You was all crazy to go.\"  \"And nothing but an old stone hut some trapper had built!\" came an indignant, female tone. \"There never was any castle, nor--\"  \"A man's home is his castle,\" argued Andy, standing unabashed before them. \"Putting it that way, it was a castle, all right.\"  There was babel, out of which--  \"And the skeleton! Oh, you--it was a dead _cow!_\" This from the young old lady, who was looking very draggled and not at all young.  \"I don't call to mind ever saying it was human,\" put in Andy, looking at her with surprised, gray eyes.  \"And the battlements!\" groaned the-girl-who-does-things.  \"You wanted battlements,\" Andy flung mildly into the uproar. \"I always aim to please.\" With that he edged away from them and made his escape to where the cook was profanely mixing biscuits for supper. All-day moves put an edge to his temper. The cook growled an epithet, and Andy passed on. Down near the stable he met one of the chosen half, and the fellow greeted him with a grin. Andy stopped abruptly.  \"Say, they don't seem none too agreeable,\" he began tentatively, jerking his thumb toward the buzzing group. \"How about it, Sandy? Was they that petulant all the way?\"  Sandy, the map-bearer, chuckled. \"It's lucky you got hurt at the last minute! And yet it was worth the trip. Uh course we got stalled with the wagons, the second day out, but them women was sure ambitious, and made us go on with a packadero layout. I will say that, going down, they stood the hardships remarkable. It was coming back that frazzled the party.  \"And when we found the place--say, but it was lucky you wasn't along! They sure went hog-wild when they seen the ruins. The old party with the pompadoor displayed temper, and shed tears uh rage. When she looked into the cabin and seen the remains uh that cow-critter, there was language it wasn't polite to overhear. She said a lot uh things about you, Andy. One thing they couldn't seem to get over, and that was the smallness uh the blamed shack. Them fourteen or fifteen rooms laid heavy on their minds.\"  \"I didn't say there was fourteen or fifteen rooms. I said I didn't count the rooms; I didn't either. I never heard of anybody counting one room. Did you, Pink?\"  \"No,\" Pink agreed, \"I never did!\"  Sandy became suddenly convulsed. \"Oh, but the funniest thing was the ancient pottery,\" he gasped, the tears standing in his eyes. \"That old Dutch oven was bad enough; but when one uh the girls--that one that collects old dishes--happened across an old mackerel can and picked it up and saw the fish on the label, she was the maddest female person I ever saw in my life, barring none. If you'd been in reach about that time, she'd just about clawed your eyes out, Andy Green. Oh me, oh my!\" Sandy slapped his thigh and had another spasm.  Sounds indicated that the wave of recrimination was rolling nearer. Andy turned to find himself within arm's length of Uncle Pete.  \"Maybe this is your idea of a practical joke, Green,\" he said to Andy. \"But anyway, it will cost you your job. I ought to charge you up with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],["title","The Happy Family (#3)"],["body","time my outfit has spent gallivanting around the country on the strength of your wild yarn. The quicker you hit the trail, the better it will suit me. By the way, what's your first name?\" He asked, pulling out a check-book.  \"Andy,\" answered the unrepentant one.  \"Andy,\" Uncle Peter paused with a fountain pen between his fingers. He looked Andy up and down, and the frown left his face. He proceeded to write out the check, and when it was done he handed it over with a pleased smile.  \"What did you do it for, Green?\" he queried in a friendlier tone.  \"Self-defence,\" Andy told him laconically, and turned away.  Half an hour later, Andy and Pink trailed out of the coulee that sheltered the Rocking R. When they were out and away from the fence, and Pink's horses, knowing instinctively that they were homeward bound, were jogging straight west without need of guidance, Andy felt in his pocket for cigarette material. His fingers came in contact with the check Uncle Peter had given him, and he drew it forth and looked it over again.  \"Well, by gracious!\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Peter thinks we're even, I guess.\"  He handed the check to Pink and rolled his cigarette; and Pink, after one comprehending look at the slip of paper, doubled up over his saddle-horn and shouted with glee--for the check was written: \"Pay to the order of Ananias Green.\"  \"And I've got to sign myself a liar, or I don't collect no money,\" sighed Andy. \"That's what I call tough luck, by gracious!\"         *       *       *       *       *     BLINK   The range-land was at its unpicturesque worst. For two days the wind had raged and ranted over the hilltops, and whooped up the long coulees, so that tears stood in the eyes of the Happy Family when they faced it; impersonal tears blown into being by the very force of the wind. Also, when they faced it they rode with bodies aslant over their saddle-horns and hats pulled low over their streaming eyes, and with coats fastened jealously close. If there were buttons enough, well and good; if not, a strap cinched tightly about the middle was considered pretty lucky and not to be despised. Though it was early September, \"sour-dough\" coats were much in evidence, for the wind had a chill way of searching to the very marrow--and even a good, sheepskin-lined \"sour-dough\" was not always protection sufficient.  When the third day dawned bleakly, literally blown piecemeal from out darkness as bleak, the Happy Family rose shiveringly and with sombre disapproval of whatever met their blood-shot eyes; dressed hurriedly in the chill of flapping tent and went out to stagger drunkenly over to where Patsy, in the mess-tent, was trying vainly to keep the biscuits from becoming dust-sprinkled, and sundry pans and tins from taking jingling little excursions on their own account. Over the brow of the next ridge straggled the cavvy, tails and manes whipping in the gale, the nighthawk swearing so that his voice came booming down to camp. Truly, the day opened inauspiciously enough for almost any dire ending.  As further evidence, saddling horses for circle resolved itself, as Weary remarked at the top of his voice to Pink, at his elbow, into \"a free-for-all broncho busting tournament.\" For horses have nerves, and nothing so rasps the nerves of man or beast as a wind that never stops blowing; which means swaying ropes and popping saddle leather, and coat-tails flapping like wet sheets on a clothes line. Horses do not like these things, and they are prone to eloquent manifestations of their disapproval.  Over by the bed-wagon, a man they called Blink, for want of a better name, was fighting his big sorrel silently, with that dogged determination which may easily grow malevolent. The sorrel was at best a high-tempered, nervous beast, and what with the wind and the flapping of everything in sight, and the pitching of half-a-dozen horses around him, he was nearly crazed with fear in the abstract.  Blink was trying to bridle him, and he was not saying a word--which, in the general uproar, was strange. But Blink seldom did say anything. He was one of the aliens who had drifted into the Flying U outfit that spring, looking for work. Chip had taken him on, and he had stayed. He could ride anything in his string, and he was always just where he was wanted. He never went to town when the others clattered off for a few hours' celebration more or less mild, he never took part in any of the camp fun, and he never offended any man. If any offended him they did not know it unless they were observant; if they were, they would see his pale lashes wink fast for a minute, and they might read aright the sign and refrain from further banter. So Blink, though he was counted a good man on roundup, was left pretty much alone when in camp.  Andy Green, well and none too favorably known down Rocking R way, and lately adopted into the Happy Family on the recommendation of Pink and his own pleasing personality, looped the latigo into the holder, gave his own dancing steed a slap of the don't-try-to-run-any-whizzers-on-me variety, and went over to help out Blink.  Blink eyed his approach with much the same expression with which he eyed the horse. \"I never hollered for assistance,\" he remarked grudgingly when Andy was at his elbow. \"When I can't handle any of the skates in my string, I'll quit riding and take to sheep-herding.\" Whereupon he turned his back as squarely as he might upon Andy and made another stealthy grab for the sorrel's ears. (There is such a thing in the range-land as jealousy among riders, and the fame of Andy Green had gone afar.)  \"All right. Just as you say, and not as I care a darn,\" Andy retorted, and went back to where his own mount stood tail to the wind. He did not in the least mind the rebuff; he really felt all the indifference his manner portrayed--perhaps even more. He had offered help where help was needed, and that ended it for him. It never occurred to him that Blink might feel jealous over Andy's hard-earned reputation as a \"tamer of wild ones,\" or mistake his good nature for patronage.  Five minutes later, when Chip looked around comprehensively at the lot of them in various degrees of readiness; saw that Blink was still fighting silently for mastery of the sorrel and told Andy to go over and help him get saddled, Andy said nothing of having had his services refused, but went. This time, Blink also said nothing, but accepted in ungracious surrender the assistance thus thrust upon him. For on the range-land, unless one is in a mind to roll his bed and ride away, one does not question when the leader commands. Andy's attitude was still that of indifference; he really thought very little about Blink or his opinions, and the rapid blinking of the pale lashes was quite lost upon him.  They rode, eighteen ill-natured, uncomfortable cowboys, tumultuously away from the camp, where canvas bulged and swayed, and loose corners cracked like pistol shots, over the hill where even the short, prairie grass crouched and flattened itself against the sod; where stray pebbles, loosened by the ungentle tread of pitching hoofs, skidded twice as far as in calm weather. The gray sky bent threateningly above them, wind-torn into flying scud but never showing a hint of blue. Later there might be rain, sleet, snow--or sunshine, as nature might whimsically direct; but for the present she seemed content with only the chill wind that blew the very heart out of a man.  Whenever Chip pulled up to turn off a couple of riders that they might search a bit of rough country, his voice was sharp with the general discomfort. When men rode away at his command, it was with brows drawn together and vengeful heels digging the short-ribs of horses in quite as unlovely a mood as themselves.  Out at the end of the \"circle,\" Chip divided the remainder of his men into two groups for the homeward drive. One group he himself led. The other owned Weary as temporary commander and galloped off to the left, skirting close to the foothills of the Bear Paws. In that group rode Pink and Happy Jack, Slim, Andy Green and Blink the silent.  \"I betche we get a blizzard out uh this,\" gloomed Happy Jack, pulling his coat collar up another fraction of an inch. \"And the way Chip's headed us, we got to cross that big flat going back in the thick of it; chances is, we'll git lost.\"  No one made reply to this; it seemed scarcely worth while. Every man of them rode humped away from the wind, his head drawn down as close to his shoulders as might be. Conversation under those conditions was not likely to become brisk.  \"A fellow that'll punch cows for a living,\" Happy Jack asserted venomously after a minute, \"had ought to be shut up somewheres. He sure ain't responsible. I betche next summer don't see me at it.\"  \"Aw, shut up. We know you're feeble-minded, without you blatting it by the hour,\" snapped Pink, showing never a dimple.  Happy Jack tugged again at his collar and made remarks, to which no one paid the slightest attention. They rode in amongst the hills and narrow ridges dividing \"draws\" as narrow, where range cattle would seek shelter from the cutting blast that raked the open. Then, just as they began to realize that the wind was not quite such a raging torment, came a new phase of nature's unpleasant humor.  It was not a blizzard that descended upon them, though when it came rolling down from the hilltops it much resembled one. The wind had changed and brought fog, cold, suffocating, impenetrable. Yet such was the mood of them that no one said anything about it. Weary had been about to turn off a couple of men, but did not. What was the use, since they could not see twenty yards?  For a time they rode aimlessly, Weary in the lead. Then, when it grew no better but worse, he pulled up, just where a high bank shut off the wind and a tangle of brush barred the way in front.  \"We may as well camp right here till things loosen up a little,\" he said. \"There's no use playing"]]]
