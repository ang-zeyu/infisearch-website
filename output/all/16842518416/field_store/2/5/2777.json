And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,    \"I will not wear a similar dress any more,     Any more, any more, any more, never more!\"     MR. AND MRS. DISCOBBOLOS.                      I.      Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos         Climbed to the top of a wall.       And they sate to watch the sunset sky,       And to hear the Nupiter Piffkin cry,         And the Biscuit Buffalo call.     They took up a roll and some Camomile tea,     And both were as happy as happy could be,             Till Mrs. Discobbolos said,--            \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!             It has just come into my head,       Suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                         Darling Mr. Discobbolos!                       II.     \"Suppose we should fall down flumpetty,         Just like pieces of stone,       On to the thorns, or into the moat,       What would become of your new green coat?         And might you not break a bone?     It never occurred to me before,     That perhaps we shall never go down any more!\"             And Mrs. Discobbolos said,            \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!             What put it into your head       To climb up this wall, my own                         Darling Mr. Discobbolos?\"                       III.      Mr. Discobbolos answered,        \"At first it gave me pain,       And I felt my ears turn perfectly pink       When your exclamation made me think         We might never get down again!     But now I believe it is wiser far     To remain for ever just where we are.\"             And Mr. Discobbolos said,            \"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!             It has just come into my head       We shall never go down again,                         Dearest Mrs. Discobbolos!\"                       IV.      So Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos         Stood up and began to sing,--      \"Far away from hurry and strife       Here we will pass the rest of life,         Ding a dong, ding dong, ding!     We want no knives nor forks nor chairs,     No tables nor carpets nor household cares;             From worry of life we've fled;             Oh! W! X! Y! Z!             There is no more trouble ahead,       Sorrow or any such thing,                         For Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos!\"     THE QUANGLE WANGLE'S HAT.  [Illustration]                      I.      On the top of the Crumpetty Tree         The Quangle Wangle sat,     But his face you could not see,         On account of his Beaver Hat.     For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,     With ribbons and bibbons on every side,     And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,     So that nobody ever could see the face             Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.                       II.      The Quangle Wangle said         To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,     \"Jam, and jelly, and bread         Are the best of food for me!     But the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree     The plainer than ever it seems to me     That very few people come this way     And that life on the whole is far from gay!\"             Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.                       III.      But there came to the Crumpetty Tree         Mr. and Mrs. Canary;     And they said, \"Did ever you see         Any spot so charmingly airy?     May we build a nest on your lovely Hat?     Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!     O please let us come and build a nest     Of whatever material suits you best,             Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!\"                       IV.      And besides, to the Crumpetty Tree         Came the Stork, the Duck, and the Owl;     The Snail and the Bumble-Bee,         The Frog and the Fimble Fowl     (The Fimble Fowl, with a Corkscrew leg);     And all of them said, \"We humbly beg     We may build our homes on your lovely Hat,--     Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!        Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!\"                       V.      And the Golden Grouse came there,         And the Pobble who has no toes,     And the small Olympian bear,         And the Dong with a luminous nose.     And the Blue Baboon who played the flute,     And the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute,     And the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,--     All came and built on the lovely Hat       Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.                      VI.      And the Quangle Wangle said         To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,     \"When all these creatures move         What a wonderful noise there'll be!\"     And at night by the light of the Mulberry moon     They danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon,     On the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree,     And all were as happy as happy could be,       With the Quangle Wangle Quee.     THE CUMMERBUND. An Indian Poem.                      I.  She sate upon her Dobie,     To watch the Evening Star, And all the Punkahs, as they passed,     Cried, \"My! how fair you are!\" Around her bower, with quivering leaves,     The tall Kamsamahs grew, And Kitmutgars in wild festoons     Hung down from Tchokis blue.                       II.  Below her home the river rolled     With soft meloobious sound, Where golden-finned Chuprassies swam,     In myriads circling round. Above, on tallest trees remote     Green Ayahs perched alone, And all night long the Mussak moan'd     Its melancholy tone.                       III.  And where the purple Nullahs threw     Their branches far and wide, And silvery Goreewallahs flew     In silence, side by side, The little Bheesties' twittering cry     Rose on the flagrant air, And oft the angry Jampan howled     Deep in his hateful lair.                       IV.  She sate upon her Dobie,     She heard the Nimmak hum, When all at once a cry arose,     \"The Cummerbund is come!\" In vain she fled: with open jaws     The angry monster followed, And so (before assistance came)     That Lady Fair was swollowed.                       V.  They sought in vain for even a bone     Respectfully to bury; They said, \"Hers was a dreadful fate!\"     (And Echo answered, \"Very.\") They nailed her Dobie to the wall,     Where last her form was seen, And underneath they wrote these words,     In yellow, blue, and green: \"Beware, ye Fair! Ye Fair, beware!     Nor sit out late at night, Lest horrid Cummerbunds should come,     And swollow you outright.\"   NOTE.--First published in _Times of India_, Bombay, July, 1874.

X                 [Illustration]      X was King Xerxes, whom         Papa much wished to know;     But this he could not do, because         Xerxes died long ago.
