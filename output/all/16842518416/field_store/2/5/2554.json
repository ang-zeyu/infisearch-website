From sufferings and from sins releas'd, And freed from every snare.  3 Far from this world of toil and strife, They're present with the Lord; The labours of their mortal life End in a large reward.   Hymn 1:19. The song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable, Luke 2. 27 &c.  1 Lord at thy temple we appear, As happy Simeon came, And hope to meet our Saviour here; O make our joys the same!  2 With what divine and vast delight The good old man was fill'd, When fondly in his wither'd arms He clasp'd the holy child!  3 \"Now I can leave this world,\" he cry'd, \"Behold thy servant dies, \"I've seen thy great salvation, Lord, \"And close my peaceful eyes.  4 \"This is the light prepar'd to shine \"Upon the Gentile lands, \"Thine Israel's glory, and their hope \"To break their slavish bands.\"  5 [Jesus, the vision of thy face Hath overpowering charms Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace If Christ be in my arms.  6 Then while ye hear my heart-strings break, How sweet my minutes roll! A mortal paleness on my cheek, And glory in my soul.]   Hymn 1:20. Spiritual apparel; namely, the robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, Isa. 61. 10.  1 Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue, Prepare a tuneful voice, In God the life of all my joys, Aloud will I rejoice.  2 'Tis he adorn'd my naked soul, And made salvation mine, Upon a poor polluted worm He makes his graces shine.  3 And lest the shadow of a spot Should on my soul be found, He took the robe the Saviour wrought, And cast it all around.  4 How far the heavenly robe exceeds What earthly princes wear! These ornaments, how bright they shine! How white the garments are!  5 The Spirit wrought my faith and love, And hope, and every grace; But Jesus spent his life to work The robe of righteousness.  6 Strangely, my soul, art thou array'd By the great sacred Three: In sweetest harmony of praise Let all thy powers agree.   Hymn 1:21. A vision of the kingdom of Christ among men, Rev. 21. 1-4.  1 Lo, what a glorious sight appears To our believing eyes! The earth and sea are pass'd away, And the old rolling skies.  2 From the third heaven where God resides, That holy happy place, The New Jerusalem comes down Adorn'd with shining grace.  3 Attending angels shout for joy, And the bright armies sing, \"Mortals, behold the sacred seat \"Of your descending King.  4 \"The God of glory down to men \"Removes his blest abode, \"Men the dear objects of his grace, \"And he the loving God.  5 \"His own soft hand shall wipe the tears \"From every weeping eye, \"And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears, \"And death itself shall die.\"  6 How long, dear Saviour, O how long, Shall this bright hour delay! Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time, And bring the welcome day.   Hymn 1:22. [Supplement.] Flesh and Spirit. Rom. 8. 1.  1 What vain desires, and passions vain, Attend this mortal clay! Oft have they pierc'd my soul with pain, And drawn my heart astray.  2 How have I wander'd from my God, And following sin and shame In this vile world of flesh and blood Defil'd my nobler frame!  3 For ever blessed be thy grace That form'd my soul anew, And made it of an heaven-born race, Thy glory to pursue.  4 My spirit holds perpetual war, And wrestles and complains; But views the happy moment near That shall dissolve its chains.  5 Cheerful in death I close my eyes, To part with every lust; And charge my flesh whene'er it rise To leave them in the dust.  6 My purer spirit shall not fear To put this body on: Its tempting powers no more are there, Its lusts and passions gone.   Hymn 1:23. [Supplement.] A hopeful youth falling short of heaven, Mark 10. 21.  1 Must all the charms of nature then So hopeless to salvation prove? Can hell demand, can heaven condemn The man whom Jesus deigns to love?  2 The man who sought the ways of truth, Paid friends and neighbours all their due, (A modest, sober, lovely youth) And thought he wanted nothing now.  3 But mark the change! thus spake the Lord, \"Come, part with earth for heaven to-day,\" The youth astonish'd at the word, In silent sadness went his way.  4 Poor virtues that he boasted so, This test unable to endure; Let Christ, and grace, and glory go To make his land and money sure.  5 Ah foolish choice of treasures here! Ah fatal love of tempting gold! Must this base world be bought so dear? Are life and heaven so cheaply sold?  6 In vain the charms of nature shine, If this vile passion govern me: Transform my soul, O love divine, And make me part with all for thee.   Hymn 1:24. The rich sinner dying, Psalm 49. 6 9. Eccl. 8. 8. Job 3. 14 15.  1 In vain the wealthy mortals toil, And heap their shining dust in vain, Look down and scorn the humble poor, And boast their lofty hills of gain.  2 Their golden cordials cannot ease Their pained hearts or aching heads, Nor fright nor bribe approaching death From glittering roofs and downy beds.  3 The lingering, the unwilling soul The dismal summons must obey, And bid a long a sad farewell To the pale lump of lifeless clay.  4 Thence they are huddled to the grave, Where kings and slaves have equal thrones; Their bones without distinction lie Amongst the heap of meaner bones.  The rest referred to Psalm 49.   Hymn 1:25. A vision of the Lamb, Rev 5. 6-9.  1 All mortal vanities, be gone, Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears, Behold amidst th' eternal throne A vision of the Lamb appears.  2[Glory his fleecy robe adorns, Mark'd with the bloody death he bore; Seven are his eyes, and seven his horns, To speak his wisdom and his power.  3 Lo, he receives a sealed book From him that sits upon the throne: Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look On dark decrees, and things unknown.]  4 All the assembling saints around Fall worshipping before the Lamb, And in new songs of gospel-sound Address their honours to his name,  5 The joy, the shout, the harmony Flies o'er the everlasting hills, \"Worthy art thou alone,\" they cry, \"To read the book, to loose the seals.\"]  6 Our voices join the heavenly strain, And with transporting pleasure sing, \"Worthy the Lamb that once was slain, \"To be our teacher and our king!\"  7 His words of prophecy reveal Eternal counsels, deep designs; His grace and vengeance shall fulfil The peaceful and the dreadful lines.  8 Thou hast redeem'd our souls from hell 'With thine invaluable blood; And wretches that did once rebel Are now made favourites of their Cod.  9 Worthy for ever is the Lord, That died for treasons not his own, By every tongue to be ador'd, And dwell upon his Father's throne.   Hymn 1:26. Hope of heaven by the resurrection of Christ, 1 Peter 1. 3-5.  1 Bless'd be the everlasting God, The Father of our Lord, Be his abounding mercy prais'd, His majesty ador'd.  2 When from the dead he rais'd his Son, And call'd him to the sky, He gave our souls a lively hope That they should never die.  3 What tho' our inbred sins require Our flesh to see the dust! Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose, So all his followers must.  4 There's an inheritance divine Reserv'd against that day, 'Tis uncorrupted, undefil'd, And cannot waste away.  5 Saints by the power of God are kept Till the salvation come; We walk by faith as strangers here Till Christ shall call us home.   Hymn 1:27. Assurance of heaven; or, A saint prepared to die, 2 Tim. 4. 6 7 8 18.  1 [Death may dissolve my body now, And bear my spirit home; Why do my minutes move so slow, Nor my salvation come?  2 With heavenly weapons I have fought The battles of the Lord, Finish'd my course, and kept the faith, And wait the sure reward.]  3 God has laid up in heaven for me A crown which cannot fade; The righteous Judge at that great day Shall place it on my head.  4 Nor hath the King of grace decreed This prize for me alone; But all that love and long to see Th' appearance of his Son.  5 Jesus the Lord shall guard me safe From every ill design; And to his heavenly kingdom keep This feeble soul of mine.  6 God is my everlasting aid And hell shall rage in vain; To him be highest glory paid, And endless praise.--Amen.   Hymn 1:28. The triumph of Christ over the enemies of his church, Isa. 63. 1 2 3 &c.  1 What mighty man, or mighty God, Comes travelling in state, Along the Idumean road, Away from Bozrah's gate?  2 The glory of his robes proclaim 'Tis some victorious king: \"'Tis I, the just, th' Almighty One, \"That your salvation bring.\"  3 \"Why, mighty Lord,\" thy saints enquire, \"Why thine apparel red? \"And all thy vesture stain'd like those \"Who in the wine-press tread?\"  4 \"I by myself have trod the press, \"And crush'd my foes alone, \"My wrath has struck the rebels dead, \"My fury stamp'd them down.  5 \"'Tis Edom's blood that dyes my robes \"With joyful scarlet stains, \"The triumph that my raiment wears \"Sprung from their bleeding veins.  6 \"Thus shall the nations be destroy'd \"That dare insult my saints, \"I have an arm t' avenge their wrongs, \"An ear for their complaints.\"   Hymn 1:29. The ruin of Antichrist, Isa. 63. 4-7.  1 \"I lift my banners,\" saith the Lord, \"Where Antichrist has stood, \"The city of my gospel-foes \"Shall be a field of blood.  2 \"My heart has study'd just revenge, \"And now the day appears, \"The day of my redeem'd is come \"To wipe away their tears.  3 \"Quite weary is my patience grown, \"And bids my fury go \"Swift as the lightning it shall move, \"And be as fatal too.  4 \"I call for helpers but in vain: \"Then has my gospel none? \"Well, mine own arm has might enough \"To crush my foes alone.  5 \"Slaughter and my devouring sword \"Shall walk the streets around, \"Babel shall reel beneath my stroke, \"And stagger to the ground.\"  6 Thy honours, O victorious King! Thine own right-hand shall raise, While we thy awful vengeance sing, And our deliverer praise.   Hymn 1:30. Prayer for deliverance answered, Isa. 26. 8-12 20 21.  1 In thine own ways, O God of love, We wait the visits of thy grace, Our souls desire is to thy Name, And the remembrance of thy face.  2 My thoughts are searching,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],["title","Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#3)"],["body",", for thee, 'Mongst the black shades of lonesome night; My earnest cries salute the skies Before the dawn restore the light.  3 Look, how rebellious men deride The tender patience of my God; But they shall see thy lifted hand, And feel the scourges of thy rod.  4 Hark, the Eternal rends the sky, A mighty voice before him goes, A voice of music to his friends, But threatening thunder to his foes.  5 Come, children, to your Father's arms, Hide in the chambers of my grace, Till the fierce storms be overblown, And my revenging fury cease.  6 My sword shall boast its thousands slain, And drink the blood of haughty kings, While heavenly peace around my flock Stretches its soft and shady wings.   Hymn 1:31. [Supplement.] The hidden life of a Christian, Col. 3. 3.  1 O happy soul that lives on high; While men lie grovelling here! His hopes are fix'd above the sky, And faith forbids his fear.  2 His conscience knows no secret stings, While peace and joy combine To form a life whose holy springs Are hidden and divine.  3 He waits in secret on his God; His God in secret sees: Let earth be all in arms abroad, He dwells in heavenly peace.  4 His pleasures rise from things unseen, Beyond this world and time, Where neither eyes nor ears have been, Nor thoughts of sinners climb.  5 He wants no pomp nor royal throne To raise his figure here; Content and pleas'd to live unknown, Till Christ his life appear.  6 He looks to heaven's eternal hill To meet that glorious day: But patient waits his Saviour's will To fetch his soul away.   Hymn 1:32. Strength from heaven, Isa. 40. 27-30.  1 Whence do our mournful thoughts arise? And where's our courage fled? Has restless sin and raging hell Struck all our comforts dead?  2 Have we forgot th' almighty Name That form'd the earth and sea? And can an all-creating arm Grow weary or decay?  3 Treasures of everlasting might In our Jehovah dwell; He gives the conquest to the weak, And treads their foes to hell.  4 Mere mortal power shall fade and die, And youthful vigour cease; But we that wait upon the Lord Shall feel our strength increase.  5 The saints shall mount on eagles' wings And taste the promis'd bliss, Till their unwearied feet arrive Where perfect pleasure is.   Hymn 1:33. [Supplement.] The gospel the power of God to salvation, Rom. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 18 24.  1 What shall the dying sinner do That seeks relief for all his woe? Where shall the guilty conscience find Ease for the torment of the mind?  2 How shall we get our crimes forgiven, Or form our natures fit for heaven? Can souls all o'er defil'd with sin Make their own powers and passions clean?  3 In vain we search, in vain we try, Till Jesus bring his gospel nigh; 'Tis there such power and glory dwell As saves rebellious souls from hell.  4 This is the pillar of our hope That bears our fainting spirits up; We read the grace, we trust the word, And find salvation in the Lord.  5 Let men or angels dig the mines Where nature's golden treasure shines, Brought near the doctrine of the cross All nature's gold appears but dross.  6 Should vile blasphemers with disdain Pronounce the truths of Jesus vain, I'll meet the scandal and the shame, And sing and triumph in his Name.   Hymn 1:34. [Supplement.] None excluded from hope, Rom. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 24.  1 Jesus, thy blessings are not few, Nor is thy gospel weak; Thy grace can melt the stubborn Jew, And bow th' aspiring Greek.  2 Wide as the reach of Satan's rage Doth thy salvation flow; 'Tis not confin'd to sex or age, The lofty or the low.  3 While grace is offer'd to the prince, The poor may take their share; No mortal has a just pretence To perish in despair.  4 Be wise, ye men of strength and wit, Nor boast your native powers; But to his sovereign grace submit, And glory shall be yours.  5 Come, all ye vilest sinners come, He'll form your souls anew: His gospel and his heart have room For rebels such as you.  6 His doctrine is almighty love; There's virtue in his Name To turn the raven to a dove, The lion to a lamb.   Hymn 1:35. [Supplement.] Truth, sincerity, &c. Phil. 4. 8.  1 Let those who bear the Christian name Their holy vows fulfil: The saints, the followers of the Lamb, Are men of honour still.  2 True to the solemn oath they take, Tho' to their hurt they swear; Constant and just to all they speak, For God and angels hear.  3 Still with their lips their hearts agree, Nor flattering words devise, They know the God of truth can see Thro' every false disguise.  4 They hate th' appearance of a lie In all the shapes it wears; They live the truth; and, when they die, Eternal life is theirs.  5 While hypocrites and liars fly Before the Judge's frown, His faithful friends, who fear a lie, Receive th' immortal crown.   Hymn 1:36. [Supplement.] A lovely carriage.  1 O 'tis a lovely thing to see A man of prudent heart, Whose thoughts, and lips, and life agree To act a useful part.  2 When envy, strife, and wars begin, In little angry souls, Mark how the sons of peace come in, And quench the kindling coals.  3 Their minds are humble, mild, and meek, Nor let their fury rise; Nor passion moves their lips to speak, Nor pride exalts their eyes.  4 Their frame is prudence mix'd with love, Good works fulfil their day: They join the serpent with the dove, But cast the sting away.  5 Such was the Saviour of mankind; Such pleasures he pursu'd; His flesh and blood were all refin'd, His soul divinely good.  6 Lord, can these plants of virtue grow In such a heart as mine? Thy grace my nature can renew, And make my soul like thine.   Hymn 1:37. [Supplement.] Zeal and Fortitude.  1 Do I believe what Jesus saith, And think the gospel true? Lord, make me bold to own my faith, And practise virtue too.  2 Suppress my shame, subdue my fear, Arm me with heavenly zeal, That I may make thy power appear, And works of praise fulfil.  3 If men shall see my virtue shine, And spread my name abroad, Thine is the power, the praise is thine, My Saviour and my God.  4 Thus when the saints in glory meet, Their lips proclaim thy grace; They cast their honours at thy feet, And own their borrow'd rays.  PAUSE.  5 Are we the soldiers of the cross? The followers of the Lamb? And shall we fear to own his cause, Or blush to speak his name?  6 Now we must fight, if we would reign; Increase our courage, Lord! We'll bear the toil, endure the pain, Supported by thy word.  7 Thy saints in all this glorious war Shall Conquer tho' they're slain; They see the triumph from afar, And shall with Jesus reign.  8 When that illustrious day shall rise, And all thy armies shine In robes of victory thro' the skies, The glory shall be thine.   Hymn 1:38. [Supplement.] The universal law of equity. Matt. 8. 12.  1 Blessed Redeemer how divine, How righteous is this rule of thine, \"To do to all men just the same \"As we expect or wish from them.\"  2 This golden lesson, short and plain, Gives not the mind nor memory pain; And every conscience must approve This universal law of love.  3 How blest would every nation be, Thus rul'd by love and equity! All would be friends without a foe, And form a paradise below.  4 Jesus, forgive us, that we keep Thy sacred law of love asleep, No more let envy, wrath, and pride, But thy blest maxims be our guide.   Hymn 1:39. God's tender care of his church, Isa. 13 &c.  1 How shall my inward joys arise And burst into a song, Almighty love inspires my heart, And pleasure tunes my tongue.  2 God on his thirsty Sion-hill Some mercy-drops has thrown, And solemn oaths have bound his love To shower salvation down.  3 Why do we then indulge our fears, Suspicions and complaints? Is he a God, and shall his grace Grow weary of his saints?  4 Can a kind woman e'er forget The infant of her womb, And 'mongst a thousand tender thoughts Her suckling have no room?  5 \"Yet (saith the Lord) should nature change, \"And mothers monsters prove, \"Sion still dwells upon the heart \"Of everlasting love.  6 \"Deep on the palms of both my hands \"I have engrav'd her name, \"My hands shall raise her ruin'd walls, \"And build her broken frame.\"   Hymn 1:40. The business and blessedness of glorified saints, Rev. 7. 13 &c.  1 \"What happy men, or angels these \"That all their robes are spotless white? \"Whence did this glorious troop arrive \"At the pure realms of heavenly light?\"  2 From tort'ring racks and burning fires, And seas of their own blood they came; But nobler blood has wash'd their robes, Flowing from Christ the dying Lamb.  3 Now they approach th' almighty throne, With loud hosannas night and day, Sweet anthems to the great Three One Measure their blest eternity.  4 No more shall hunger pain their souls, He bids their parching thirst be gone, And spreads the shadow of his wings To screen them from the scorching sun.  5 The Lamb that fills the middle throne Shall shed around his milder beams, There shall they feast on his rich love, And drink full joys from living streams.  6 Thus shall their mighty bliss renew Thro' the vast round of endless years, And the soft hand of sovereign grace Heals all their wounds, and wipes their tears.   Hymn 1:41. The same; or, The martyrs glorified, Rev. 7. 13 &c.  1 \"These glorious minds, how bright they shine \"Whence all their white array? \"How came they to the happy seats \"Of everlasting day?\"  2 From tort'ring pains to endless joys On fiery wheels they rode, And strangely wash'd their raiment white In Jesus' dying blood.  3 Now they approach a spotless God, And bow before his throne Their warbling harps and sacred songs Adore the Holy One.  4 The unveil'd glories of his face Amongst his saints reside, While the rich treasure of his grace Sees all their wants supply'd.  5 Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls, And hunger flee as fast; The fruit of life's immortal tree Shall be their sweet repast.  6 The Lamb shall lead his heavenly flock Where living fountains rise, And love divine shall wipe away The sorrows of their eyes.   Hymn 1:42. Divine wrath and mercy, Nahum 1, 2 &c.  1 Adore and tremble, for"]]]
