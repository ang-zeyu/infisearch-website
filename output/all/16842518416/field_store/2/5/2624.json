Gray felt very sore, and wanted to leave the pond at once, but before he could do so Tom skated up to him and held out his hand.  \"You came pretty close to beating me,\" he said. \"I can't really say how I got ahead at the finish.\"  \"I--I guess my skate slipped, or something,\" stammered Gray, and shook hands. Tom's candor took away the keen edge of the defeat.  The Putnam Hall boys were wild with delight, and insisted upon carrying Tom on their shoulders around the pond. A great crowd followed, and nobody noticed how this made the ice bend and crack.  \"Be careful there!\" shouted Mr. Strong warningly. \"There are too many of you in a bunch!\" But ere he had finished the sentence there came another loud cracking, and in a twinkle a section of the ice went down, plunging fully a dozen lads into the icy water below.     CHAPTER X.  THE END OF THE TERM.   \"The ice has gone down!\"  \"Some of the boys will be drowned!\"  \"Get some boards and a rope, quick!\"  These and a score of other cries rang out. In the meantime those near to the hole skated with all speed to one place of safety or another.  Some of the imperiled boys who had not gone down very deeply managed to scramble out with wet feet or wet lower limbs only, but when the crowd had drawn back it was seen that three boys were floundering in the chilling water over their heads. These boys were George Granbury and Frank Harrington, who had been supporting Tom on their shoulders, and Tom himself, who had been dropped into the opening head first by the frightened lads.  Realizing that something must be done at once, Mr. Strong ran to the boathouse, which was close at hand, and soon reappeared, carrying a long plank. He was followed by a boy with a rope, and several boys brought more planks and more ropes.  [Illustration: THE MISHAP ON THE ICE. _Rover Boys in the Mountains_.]  When the first plank was pushed out Tom lost no time in grasping hold of it. He crawled to a safe place on hands and knees, but was so nearly paralyzed he could not stand up.  \"I'll carry him up to the Hall,\" said Peleg Snuggers, who had chanced upon the scene, and without ceremony he picked Tom up in his strong arms and made off for the school building on a run.  After Tom came Frank Harrington, who caught hold of one end of a rope tossed toward the hole. As soon as he shouted he had the rope secure, a dozen boys pulled upon it, and Frank was literally dragged from his icy bath. Once on shore he was started on a run for the Hall, some boys rushing ahead to obtain dry clothing for both him and the others.  Poor George Granbury was now the only one left in danger, and matters appeared to be going hard with him. He clutched at one of the planks thrust toward him, but his hold slipped and down he went out of sight.  \"He'll be drowned! He's too cold to save himself!\" was the cry of several who were watching him.  \"Be careful, boys!\" came warningly from Mr. Strong. \"Be careful, or somebody else will get in!\"  \"Mr. Strong, if you will hold the plank, I'll crawl out and get hold of Granbury,\" came from Dick, in a determined voice.  \"Rover, can you do it?\"  \"I feel certain I can. Hold tight, please.\"  Dick leaped upon the plank and threw himself flat. Then he crawled out as fast as he could, until he was on the end over the open water. Holding to the plank with one hand he reached out to grasp George's shoulder with the other.  \"Sa--save me!\" gasped the drowning boy.  \"Give me your hand, George,\" called Dick.  Granbury tried to do so, but the effort was a failure, for the cold had so numbed him he could scarcely move. Reaching as far as he could, Dick caught a portion of his coat and drew the helpless boy toward him.  The ice cracked ominously, but did not break. Mr. Strong warned the others still further back.  Slowly but surely Dick raised George to a level of the plank. Then with an extra effort he hauled the half-drowned boy up.  \"Now haul in on the plank,\" he called, and Mr. Strong and two boys did so immediately. In a moment more danger from drowning was a thing of the past for George Granbury.  A cheer went up because of Dick's heroic action, but this was instantly hushed as George was seen to stagger back and fall as if dead. Instantly Mr. Strong picked the boy up in his arms and ran toward the Hall.  \"Oh, Dick, how noble of you!\" It was Dora Stanhope who spoke, as she came up and placed a trembling little hand on his arm. \"And how glad I am that you didn't get in while doing it.\" And her eyes filled with tears.  \"I--I'm glad too, Dora,\" he said brokenly. And then added: \"Excuse me, but I guess I'd better go up and see how Tom is making out.\"  \"To be sure, and let me know if it's all right,\" she replied.  Once inside the Hall Dick learned that Tom had been put into a warm bed. He was apparently none the worse for his mishap, and likely to be as full of life and fun as ever on the morrow.  Poor Granbury, however, was not so well off. It took some time to restore him to consciousness, and while Captain Putnam and Mr. Strong put him to bed, with hot-water bags to warm him up, Peleg Snuggers was sent off post-haste for a doctor. As a result of the adventure Granbury had to remain in bed for the best part of a week.  \"I shan't forget you for what you did,\" he said to Dick, when able to sit up. \"You saved my life.\" And many agreed that what George Granbury said was true. As for Dora Stanhope, she looked upon the elder Rover as more of a hero than ever.  After the mishap at the races on the ice the time flew by swiftly until the Christmas holidays. Before going home for Christmas Dick called upon the Stanhopes and gave them the gifts he had purchased, over which they were much pleased. For Dick Dora had worked a pretty scarf, of which he was justly proud. Mrs. Stanhope had books for all the boys, something which was always to their liking. The Rovers did not forget the Lanings, nor were they forgotten by these old friends.  \"And now for home. Hurrah!\" shouted Sam, on the way to Cedarville. \"I must say I'm just a bit anxious to see the old place once more.\"  \"Yes, and see father, and Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha,\" put in Dick.  \"Don't forget Alexander Pop,\" put in Tom, referring to the colored man who had once been a waiter at the Hall, and who was now in the Rover employ.  \"And Jack Ness and the rest,\" put in Sam. \"I guess we'll be glad enough to see everybody.\"  When the boys arrived at Ithaca they found there had been a freight smash-up on the railroad, and that they would have to wait for five or six hours for a train to take them home. This would bring them to Oak Run, their railroad station, at three o'clock in the morning.  \"I move we stay in Ithaca over night,\" said Tom. \"If we got to Oak Run at three in the morning, what would we do? There would be no one there to meet us, and it's a beastly hour for rousing anybody out.\"  So they decided to put up at a hotel in Ithaca, and went around to a new place called the Students' Rest. The hotel was fairly well filled, but they secured a large apartment with two double beds.  \"There's a nice concert on this evening by a college glee club,\" said Sam. \"I move we get tickets and go.\"  \"Second the motion,\" said Tom promptly.  \"The motion is put and carried,\" put in Dick just as promptly. \"I trust, though, the concert don't make us weep.\"  \"They won't know we're there, so perhaps they won't try it on too hard,\" said Sam, and there the students' slang came to an end for the time being.  The concert was quite to their taste, and they were surprised, when it was over, to learn that it was after eleven o'clock.  \"I hadn't any idea it was so late,\" exclaimed Dick. \"We'd better be getting back to the hotel, or we won't get our money's worth out of that room.\"  \"That's right,\" laughed Tom. \"Although, to tell the truth, I'm not very sleepy.\"  Several blocks were covered when Sam, who was looking across the street, uttered a cry of astonishment.  \"Look!\" he exclaimed.  \"At what?\" asked both Tom and Dick.  \"Over in front of that clothing store. There is Dan Baxter, and Jasper Grinder is with him!\"  \"Sam is right,\" came from Dick. \"They must have struck up some sort of a friendship, or they wouldn't be here together.\"  \"Let's go over and see what Baxter has to say for himself,\" said Tom boldly.  \"All right,\" returned Dick. \"But we want to keep out of a row; remember that.\"  They crossed the street and walked straight up to Baxter and Jasper Grinder, who were holding an animated conversation in the doorway of a clothing establishment which was closed for the night.  As they came up, Sam caught the words, \"There is money there, sure,\" coming from Baxter. He paid no attention to the words at the time, but remembered them long afterward, and with good reason.  \"Hullo, Baxter!\" said Dick, halting in front of the bully.  Dan Baxter gave a start, as if detected in some wrong act. Then, as the light from an electric lamp shone upon Dick's face, he glared sourly at the oldest Rover.  \"Where did you come from?\" he asked, and then, seeing the other Rovers, added: \"Been following me, I suppose?\"  \"No, we haven't been following you,\" said Dick. \"We just came from, the college boys' concert in the hall down the street.\"  Jasper Grinder looked as sour as did Dan Baxter. Then he shook his finger in Dick's face.  \"I haven't forgotten you, Richard Rover,\" he said bitterly. \"And I am not likely to forget you.\"  \"As you please, Mr. Grinder,\" was the cool rejoinder.  \"And I shan't forget you, Jasper Grinder,\" put in Sam. \"You were the means of my going to bed with a heavy cold.\"  \"Bah! it was all put on,\" exclaimed Jasper Grinder. \"Had I had my way, I would have kept you in the storeroom all night, and flogged you beside.\"  \"Captain Putnam did a good thing when he dismissed you,\" put in Tom. \"It's a pity he ever took on such a cold-hearted and miserly fellow.\"  \"You Rovers think you are on top,\" said Dan Baxter savagely. \"But you won't stay on top long,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13460"],["title","How to become like Christ (#0)"],["body","TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST   CONTENTS    How to Become Like Christ   The Transfiguration   Indiscreet Importunity   Shame on Account of God's Displeasure   Naaman Cured   The Lame Man at the Temple Gate   HOW TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST.  \"But we all, with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"--2 COR. iii. 18 (Revised Version).  I suppose there is almost no one who would deny, if it were put to him, that the greatest possible attainment a man can make in this world is likeness to The Lord Jesus Christ. Certainly no one would deny that there is nothing but character that we can carry out of life with us, and that our prospect of good in any future life will certainly vary with the resemblance of our character to that of Jesus Christ, which is to rule the whole future. We all admit that; but almost every one of us offers to himself some apology for not being like Christ, and has scarcely any clear reality of aim of becoming like Him. Why, we say to ourselves, or we say in our practice, it is really impossible in a world such as ours is to become perfectly holy. One or two men in a century may become great saints; given a certain natural disposition and given exceptionally favouring circumstances, men may become saintly; but surely the ordinary run of men, men such as we know ourselves to be, with secular disposition and with many strong, vigorous passions--surely we can really not be expected to become like Christ, or, if it is expected of us, we know that it is impossible. On the contrary, Paul says, \"We all,\" \"we all.\" Every Christian has that for a destiny: to be changed into the image of his Lord. And he not only says so, but in this one verse he reveals to us the mode of becoming like Christ, and a mode, as we shall find, so simple and so infallible in its working that a man cannot understand it without renewing his hope that even he may one day become like Christ.  In order to understand this simplest mode of sanctification we must look back at the incident that we read in the Book of Exodus (xxxiv. 29-35.). Paul had been reading how when Moses came down from the mount where he had been speaking with God his face shone, so as to dazzle and alarm those who were near him.  They at once recognised that that was the glory of God reflected from him; and just as it is almost as difficult for us to look at the sun reflected from a mirror as to look directly at the sun, so these men felt it almost as difficult to look straight at the face of Moses as to look straight at the face of God. But Moses was a wise man, and he showed his wisdom in this instance as well as elsewhere. He knew that that glory was only on the skin of his face, and that of course it would pass away. It was a superficial shining. And accordingly he put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel might not see it dying out from minute to minute and from hour to hour, because he knew these Israelites thoroughly, and he knew that when they saw the glory dying out they would say, \"God has forsaken Moses. We need not attend to him any more. His authority is gone, and the glory of God's presence has passed from him.\" So Moses wore the veil that they might not see the glory dying out. But whenever he was called back to the presence of God he took off the veil and received a new access of glory on his face, and thus went \"from glory to glory.\"  \"That,\" says Paul, \"is precisely the process through which we Christian men become like Christ.\" We go back to the presence of Christ with unveiled face; and as often as we stand in His presence, as often as we deal in our spirit with the living Christ, so often do we take on a little of His glory. The glory of Christ is His character; and as often as we stand before Christ, and think of Him, and realise what He was, our heart goes out and reflects some of His character. And that reflection, that glory, is not any longer merely on the skin of the face; as Paul wishes us to recognise, it is a spiritual glory, it is wrought by the spirit of Christ upon our spirit, and it is we ourselves that are changed from glory to glory into the very image of the Lord.  Now obviously this mode of sanctification has extraordinary recommendations. In the first place, it is absolutely simple. If you go to some priest or spiritual director, or minister of the Gospel, or friend, and ask what you are to do if you wish to become a holy man, why, even the best of them will almost certainly tell you to read certain books, to spend so much time in prayer and reading your Bible, to go regularly to church, to engage in this and that good work. If you had applied to a spiritual director of the middle ages of this world's history and of the history of Christianity, he would have told you that you must retire from the world altogether in order to become holy. Paul says, \"Away with all that nonsense!\" We are living in a real world; Christ lived in a real world: Christ did not retire from men. And He says all that you have to do in order to be like Christ is to carry His image with you in your heart. That is all. To be with Him, to let Him stand before you and command your love, that will infallibly change you into His image. I do not know that we sufficiently recognise the simplicity of Christian methods. We do not understand what Paul meant by proclaiming it as the religion of the spirit, as a religion superior to everything mechanical and external. Think of the deliverance it was for him who had grown up under a religion which commanded him to go a journey three times a year, to take the best of his goods and offer them in the Temple, to comply with a multitude of oppressive observances and ordinances. Think of the emancipation when he found a spiritual religion. Why, in those times a man must have despaired of becoming a holy man; But now Paul says you will infallibly become holy if you learn this easy lesson of carrying the Lord Jesus with you in your heart.  Another recommendation of this method is that it is so obviously grounded on our own nature. No sooner are we told by Paul that we must act as mirrors of Christ than we recognise that nature has made us to be mirrors, that we cannot but reflect what is passing before us. You are walking along the street, and, a little child runs before a carriage; you shrink back as if you were in danger. You see a man fall from a scaffolding, crushed; your face takes on an expression of pain, reflecting what is passing in him. You go and spend an evening with a man much stronger, much purer, much saner, than yourself, and you come away knowing yourself a stronger and a better man. Why? Because you are a mirror, because in your inmost nature you have responded to and reflected the good that was in him.  Look into any family, and what do you see? You see the boy, not imitating consciously, but taking on, his father's looks and attitudes and ways; and as the boy grows up these become his own looks and attitudes and ways. He has reflected his father from one degree of proficiency unto another, from one intimacy, from one day's observation of his father to another, until he is the image of the old man over again.  \"Similarly,\" says Paul, \"live with Christ; learn to carry His image with you, learn to adore Him, learn to love Him, and infallibly, whether you will or not, by this simple method you will become, Christ over again; you will become conformed, as God means you to become conformed, to the image of His Son.\"  This has been tested by the experience of thousands; and it has been found to be a true method. Every one who spends but two minutes in the morning in the observation of Christ, every one who will be at the pains to let the image of Christ rise before him and to remember the purity, the unworldliness, the heavenliness, the godliness of Jesus Christ, that man is the better for this exercise. And how utterly useless is it to offer any other method of sanctification to thousands of our fellow-citizens. How can many of our fellow-citizens secrete themselves for prayer? If you ask them to go and pray as you pray in your comfortable home, if you ask them to read the Bible before they go out at five or six o'clock in the morning, do you expect that your word will be followed? Why, the thing is impossible. But ask a man to carry Christ with him in his mind, that is a thing he can do; and if he does it once, if only once the man sees Christ before him, realises that this living Person is with him, and remembers the character of Christ as it is written for us in the Gospels, that man knows that he has made a step in advance, knows that he is the better for it, knows that he does reflect, for a little, even though it be but for a little, the very image of the Lord Jesus Christ; and other people know it also.  Now, if that is so, there are obviously three things that we must do. We must in the first place, learn to associate with Christ. I say that even one reflection does something, but we need to reflect Christ constantly, continually, if we are to become like Him. When you pass away from before a mirror the reflection also .goes. In the case of Moses the reflection stayed for a little, and that is perhaps a truer figure of what happens to the Christian who sets Christ before him and reflects him. But very often as soon as Christ is not consciously remembered you fall back to other remembrances and reflect other things. You go out in the morning with your associates, and they carry you away; you have not as yet sufficiently impressed upon yourself the image of Christ. Therefore we must learn to carry Christ with us always, as a constant Companion. Some one may say that is impossible. No one will say it is impossible who is living in absence from anyone he loves. What happens when we are living separated from some one we love? This happens: that his image is continually in our minds. At the"]]]
