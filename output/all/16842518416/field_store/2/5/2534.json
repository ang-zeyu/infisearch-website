Vt igitur in mathematica fieri solet ceterisque etiam disciplinis, praeposui terminos regulasque quibus cuncta quae sequuntur efficiam.  I. Communis animi conceptio est enuntiatio quam quisque probat auditam. Harum duplex modus est. Nam una ita communis est, ut omnium sit hominum, ueluti si hanc proponas: \"Si duobus aequalibus aequalia auferas, quae relinquantur aequalia esse,\" nullus id intellegens neget. Alia uero est doctorum tantum, quae tamen ex talibus communis animi conceptionibus uenit, ut est: \"Quae incorporalia sunt, in loco non esse,\" et cetera; quae non uulgus sed docti comprobant.  II. Diuersum est esse et id quod est; ipsum enim esse nondum est, at uero quod est accepta essendi forma est atque consistit.  III. Quod est participare aliquo potest, sed ipsum esse nullo modo aliquo participat. Fit enim participatio cum aliquid iam est; est autem aliquid, cum esse susceperit.  IV. Id quod est habere aliquid praeterquam quod ipsum est potest; ipsum uero esse nihil aliud praeter se habet admixtum.  V. Diuersum est tantum esse aliquid et esse aliquid in eo quod est; illic enim accidens hic substantia significatur.  VI. Omne quod est[31] participat eo quod est esse ut sit; alio uero participat ut aliquid sit. Ac per hoc id quod est participat eo quod est esse ut sit; est uero ut participet alio quolibet.  VII. Omne simplex esse suum et id quod est unum habet.  VIII. Omni composito aliud est esse, aliud ipsum est.  IX. Omnis diuersitas discors, similitudo uero appetenda est; et quod appetit aliud, tale ipsum esse naturaliter ostenditur quale est illud hoc ipsum quod appetit.  Sufficiunt igitur quae praemisimus; a prudente uero rationis interprete suis unumquodque aptabitur argumentis.  Quaestio uero huiusmodi est. Ea quae sunt bona sunt; tenet enim communis sententia doctorum omne quod est ad bonum tendere, omne autem tendit ad simile. Quae igitur ad bonum tendunt bona ipsa sunt. Sed quemadmodum bona sint, inquirendum est, utrumne participatione an substantia? Si participatione, per se ipsa nullo modo bona sunt; nam quod participatione album est, per se in eo quod ipsum est album non est. Et de ceteris qualitatibus eodem modo. Si igitur participatione sunt bona, ipsa per se nullo modo bona sunt: non igitur ad bonum tendunt. Sed concessum est. Non igitur participatione sunt bona sed substantia. Quorum uero substantia bona est, id quod sunt bona sunt; id quod sunt autem habent ex eo quod est esse. Esse igitur ipsorum bonum est; omnium igitur rerum ipsum esse bonum est. Sed si esse bonum est, ea quae sunt in eo quod sunt bona sunt idemque illis est esse quod boni esse; substantialia igitur bona sunt, quoniam non participant bonitatem. Quod si ipsum esse in eis bonum est, non est dubium quin substantialia cum sint bona, primo sint bono similia ac per hoc hoc ipsum bonum erunt; nihil enim illi praeter se ipsum simile est. Ex quo fit ut omnia quae sunt deus sint, quod dictu nefas est. Non sunt igitur substantialia bona ac per hoc non in his est esse bonum; non sunt igitur in eo quod sunt bona. Sed nec participant bonitatem; nullo enim modo ad bonum tenderent. Nullo modo igitur sunt bona.  Huic quaestioni talis poterit adhiberi solutio. Multa sunt quae cum separari actu non possunt, animo tamen et cogitatione separantur; ut cum triangulum uel cetera a subiecta materia nullus actu separat, mente tamen segregans ipsum triangulum proprietatemque eius praeter materiam speculatur. Amoueamus igitur primi boni praesentiam paulisper ex animo, quod esse quidem constat idque ex omnium doctorum indoctorumque sententia barbararumque gentium religionibus cognosci potest. Hoc igitur paulisper amoto ponamus omnia esse quae sunt bona atque ea consideremus quemadmodum bona esse possent, si a primo bono minime defluxissent. Hinc intueor aliud in eis esse quod bona sunt, aliud quod sunt. Ponatur enim una eademque substantia bona esse alba, grauis, rotunda. Tunc aliud esset ipsa illa substantia, aliud eius rotunditas, aliud color, aliud bonitas; nam si haec singula idem essent quod ipsa substantia, idem esset grauitas quod color, quod bonum et bonum quod grauitas--quod fieri natura non sinit. Aliud igitur tunc in eis esset esse, aliud aliquid esse, ac tunc bona quidem essent, esse tamen ipsum minime haberent bonum. Igitur si ullo modo essent, non a bono ac bona essent ac non idem essent quod bona, sed eis aliud esset esse aliud bonis esse. Quod si nihil omnino aliud essent nisi bona neque grauia neque colorata neque spatii dimensione distenta nec ulla in eis qualitas esset, nisi tantum bona essent, tunc non res sed rerum uideretur esse principium nec potius uiderentur, sed uideretur; unum enim solumque est huiusmodi, quod tantum bonum aliudque nihil sit. Quae quoniam non sunt simplicia, nec esse omnino poterant, nisi ea id quod solum bonum est esse uoluisset. Idcirco quoniam esse eorum a boni uoluntate defluxit, bona esse dicuntur. Primum enim bonum, quoniam est, in eo quod est bonum est; secundum uero bonum, quoniam ex eo fluxit cuius ipsum esse bonum est, ipsum quoque bonum est. Sed ipsum esse omnium rerum ex eo fluxit quod est primum bonum et quod bonum tale est ut recte dicatur in eo quod est esse bonum. Ipsum igitur eorum esse bonum est; tunc enim in eo.  Qua in re soluta quaestio est. Idcirco enim licet in eo quod sint bona sint, non sunt tamen similia primo bono, quoniam non quoquo modo sint res ipsum esse earum bonum est, sed quoniam non potest esse ipsum esse rerum, nisi a primo esse defluxerit, id est bono; idcirco ipsum esse bonum est nec est simile ei a quo est. Illud enim quoquo modo sit bonum est in eo quod est; non enim aliud est praeterquam bonum. Hoc autem nisi ab illo esset, bonum fortasse esse posset, sed bonum in eo quod est esse non posset. Tunc enim participaret forsitan bono; ipsum uero esse quod non haberent a bono, bonum habere non possent. Igitur sublato ab his bono primo mente et cogitatione, ista licet essent bona, tamen in eo quod essent bona esse non possent, et quoniam actu non potuere exsistere, nisi illud ea quod uere bonum est produxisset, idcirco et esse eorum bonum est et non est simile substantiali bono id quod ab eo fluxit; et nisi ab eo fluxissent, licet essent bona, tamen in eo quod sunt bona esse non possent, quoniam et praeter bonum et non ex bono essent, cum illud ipsum bonum primum est et ipsum esse sit et ipsum bonum et ipsum esse bonum. At non etiam alba in eo quod sunt alba esse oportebit ea quae alba sunt, quoniam ex uoluntate dei fluxerunt ut essent, alba minime. Aliud est enim esse, aliud albis esse; hoc ideo, quoniam qui ea ut essent effecit bonus quidem est, minime uero albus. Voluntatem igitur boni comitatum est ut essent bona in eo quod sunt; uoluntatem uero non albi non est comitata talis eius quod est proprietas ut esset album in eo quod est; neque enim ex albi uoluntate defluxerunt. Itaque quia uoluit esse ea alba qui erat non albus, sunt alba tantum; quia uero uoluit ea esse bona qui erat bonus, sunt bona in eo quod sunt. Secundum hanc igitur rationem cuncta oportet esse iusta, quoniam ipse iustus est qui ea esse uoluit? Ne hoc quidem. Nam bonum esse essentiam, iustum uero esse actum respicit. Idem autem est in eo esse quod agere; idem igitur bonum esse quod iustum. Nobis uero non est idem esse quod agere; non enim simplices sumus. Non est igitur nobis idem bonis esse quod iustis, sed idem nobis est esse omnibus in eo quod sumus. Bona igitur omnia sunt, non etiam iusta. Amplius bonum quidem generale est, iustum uero speciale nec species descendit in omnia. Idcirco alia quidem iusta alia aliud omnia bona.

[31] est _codd. inferiores; om. codd. opt._       FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME    HOW SUBSTANCES CAN BE GOOD IN VIRTUE OF THEIR EXISTENCE WITHOUT BEING   ABSOLUTE GOODS    You ask me to state and explain somewhat more clearly that obscure   question in my _Hebdomads_[32] concerning the manner in which   substances can be good in virtue of existence without being absolute   goods.[33] You urge that this demonstration is necessary because the   method of this kind of treatise is not clear to all. I can bear witness   with what eagerness you have already attacked the subject. But I confess   I like to expound my _Hebdomads_ to myself, and would rather bury   my speculations in my own memory than share them with any of those pert   and frivolous persons who will not tolerate an argument unless it is   made amusing. Wherefore do not you take objection to the obscurity that   waits on brevity; for obscurity is the sure treasure-house of secret   doctrine and has the further advantage that it speaks a language   understood only of those who deserve to understand. I have therefore   followed the example of the mathematical[34] and cognate sciences and   laid down bounds and rules according to which I shall develop all that   follows.    I. A common conception is a statement generally accepted as soon as it   is made. Of these there are two kinds. One is universally intelligible;   as, for instance, \"if equals be taken from equals the remainders are   equal.\" Nobody who grasps that proposition will deny it. The other kind   is intelligible only to the learned, but it is derived from the same   class of common conceptions; as \"Incorporeals cannot occupy space,\" and   the like. This is obvious to the learned but not to the common herd.    II. Being and a concrete thing[35] are different. Simple Being awaits   manifestation, but a thing is and exists[36] as soon as it has received   the form which gives it Being.    III. A concrete thing can participate in something else; but absolute   Being can in no wise participate in anything. For participation is   effected when a thing already is; but it is something after it has   acquired Being.    IV. That which exists can possess something besides itself. But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13316"],["title","The Theological Tractates and The Consolation of Philosophy (#8)"],["body","Being has no admixture of aught besides Itself.    V. Merely to be something and to be something absolutely are different;   the former implies accidents, the latter connotes a substance.    VI. Everything that is participates in absolute Being[37] through the   fact that it exists. In order to be something it participates in   something else. Hence that which exists participates in absolute Being   through the fact that it exists, but it exists in order to participate   in something else.    VII. Every simple thing possesses as a unity its absolute and its   particular Being.    VIII. In every composite thing absolute and individual Being are not one   and the same.    IX. Diversity repels; likeness attracts. That which seeks something   outside itself is demonstrably of the same nature as that which it   seeks.    These preliminaries are enough then for our purpose. The intelligent   interpreter of the discussion will supply the arguments appropriate to   each point.    Now the problem is this. Things which are, are good. For all the learned   are agreed that every existing thing tends to good and everything tends   to its like. Therefore things which tend to good are good. We must,   however, inquire how they are good--by participation or by substance. If   by participation, they are in no wise good in themselves; for a thing   which is white by participation in whiteness is not white in itself by   virtue of absolute Being. So with all other qualities. If then they are   good by participation, they are not good in themselves; therefore they   do not tend to good. But we have agreed that they do. Therefore they are   good not by participation but by substance. But those things whose   substance is good are substantially good. But they owe their actual   Being to absolute Being. Their absolute Being therefore is good;   therefore the absolute Being of all things is good. But if their Being   is good, things which exist are good through the fact that they exist   and their absolute Being is the same as that of the Good. Therefore they   are substantial goods, since they do not merely participate in goodness.   But if their absolute Being is good, there is no doubt but that, since   they are substantial goods, they are like the First Good and therefore   they will have to be that Good. For nothing is like It save Itself.   Hence all things that are, are God--an impious assertion. Wherefore   things are not substantial goods, and so the essence of the Good does   not reside in them. Therefore they are not good through the fact that   they exist. But neither do they receive good by participation, for they   would in no wise tend to good. Therefore they are in no wise good.[38]    This problem admits of the following solution.[39] There are many things   which can be separated by a mental process, though they cannot be   separated in fact. No one, for instance, can actually separate a   triangle or other mathematical figure from the underlying matter; but   mentally one can consider a triangle and its properties apart from   matter. Let us, therefore, remove from our minds for a moment the   presence of the Prime Good, whose Being is admitted by the universal   consensus of learned and unlearned opinion and can be deduced from the   religious beliefs of savage races. The Prime Good having been thus for a   moment put aside, let us postulate as good all things that are, and let   us consider how they could possibly be good if they did not derive from   the Prime Good. This process leads me to perceive that their Goodness   and their existence are two different things. For let me suppose that   one and the same substance is good, white, heavy, and round. Then it   must be admitted that its substance, roundness, colour, and goodness are   all different things. For if each of these qualities were the same as   its substance, weight would be the same thing as colour or goodness, and   goodness would be the same as colour; which is contrary to nature. Their   Being then in that case would be one thing, their quality another, and   they would be good, but they would not have their absolute Being good.   Therefore if they really existed at all, they would not be from good nor   good, they would not be the same as good, but Being and Goodness would   be for them two different things. But if they were nothing else but good   substances, and were neither heavy, nor coloured, and possessed neither   spatial dimension nor quality, beyond that of goodness, they (or rather   it) would seem to be not things but the principle of things. For there   is one thing alone that is by nature good to the exclusion of every   other quality. But since they are not simple, they could not even exist   at all unless that which is the one sole Good willed them to be. They   are called good simply because their Being is derived from the Will of   the Good. For the Prime Good is essentially good in virtue of Being; the   secondary good is in its turn good because it derives from the good   whose absolute Being is good. But the absolute Being of all things   derives from the Prime Good which is such that of It Being and Goodness   are rightly predicated as identical. Their absolute Being therefore is   good; for thereby it resides in Him.    Thereby the problem is solved. For though things be good through the   fact that they exist, they are not like the Prime Good, for the simple   reason that their absolute Being is not good under all circumstances,   but that things can have no absolute Being unless it derive from the   Prime Being, that is, the Prime Good; their substance, therefore, is   good, and yet it is not like that from which it comes. For the Prime   Good is good through the fact that it exists, irrespective of all   conditions, for it is nothing else than good; but the second good if it   derived from any other source might be good, but could not be good   through the fact that it exists. For in that case it might possibly   participate in good, but their substantial Being, not deriving from the   Prime Good, could not have the element of good. Therefore when we have   put out of mind the Prime Good, these things, though they might be good,   would not be good through the fact that they exist, and since they could   not actually exist unless the true good had produced them, therefore   their Being is good, and yet that which springs from the substantial   Good is not like its source which produces it. And unless they had   derived from it, though they were good yet they could not be good   through the fact that they exist because they were apart from good and   not derived from good, since that very good is the Prime Good and is   substantial Being and substantial Good and essential Goodness. But we   need not say that white things are white through the fact that they   exist; for they drew their existence from the will of God, but not their   whiteness. For to be is one thing; to be white is another; and that   because He who gave them Being is good, but not white. It is therefore   in accordance with the will of the Good that they should be good through   the fact that they exist; but it is not in accordance with the will of   one who is not white that a thing have a certain property making it   white in virtue of its Being; for it was not the will of One who is   white that gave them Being. And so they are white simply because One who   was not white willed them to be white; but they are good through the   fact that they exist because One who was good willed them to be good.   Ought, then, by parity of reason, all things to be just because He is   just who willed them to be? That is not so either. For to be good   involves Being, to be just involves an act. For Him being and action are   identical; to be good and to be just are one and the same for Him. But   being and action are not identical for us, for we are not simple. For   us, then, goodness is not the same thing as justice, but we all have the   same sort of Being in virtue of our existence. Therefore all things are   good, but all things are not just. Finally, good is a general, but just   is a species, and this species does not apply to all. Wherefore some   things are just, others are something else, but all things are good.     [32] Similarly Porphyry divided the works of Plotinus into six   _Enneades_ or groups of nine.    [33] Cf. discussion on the nature of good in _Cons._ iii. m. 10 and pr.   11 (_infra_, pp. 274 ff.).    [34] On this mathematical method of exposition cf. _Cons._ iii. pr. 10   (_infra_, p. 270).
