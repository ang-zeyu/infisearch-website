How bright his fury glows! Vast magazines of plagues and storms Lie treasur'd for his foes.  3 Those heaps of wrath by slow degrees Are forced into a flame, But kindled, O how fierce they blaze! And rend all nature's frame.  4 At his approach the mountains flee, And seek a watery grave; The frighted sea makes haste away, And shrinks up every wave.  5 Thro' the wide air the weighty rocks Are swift as hailstones hurl'd: Who dares engage his fiery rage That shakes the solid world?  6 Yet, mighty God, thy sovereign grace Sits regent on the throne, The refuge of thy chosen race When wrath comes rushing down.  7 Thy hand shall on rebellious kings A fiery tempest pour, While we beneath thy sheltering wings Thy just revenge adore.  *Hebrews 12:29.   Hymn 1:43. [Supplement.] The Christian treasure, 1 Cor. 3. 21.  1 How vast the treasure we possess! How rich thy bounty, King of Grace! This world is ours, and worlds to come Earth is our lodge, and heaven our home.  2 All things are ours, the gifts of God; The purchase of a Saviour's blood: While the good Spirit shews us how To use and to improve them too.  3 If peace and plenty crown my days, They help, me, Lord, to speak thy praise! If bread of sorrows be my food, Those sorrows work my lasting good.  4 I would not change my blest estate For all the world calls good or great: And while my faith can keep her hold, I envy not the sinner's gold.  5 Father, I wait thy daily will; Thou shalt divide my portion still: Grant me on earth what seems thee best, Till death and heaven reveal the rest.   Hymn 1:44. [Supplement.] The true improvement of life.  1 And is this life prolong'd to me? Are days and seasons given? O let me then prepare to be A fitter heir of heaven.  2 In vain these moments shall not pass, These golden hours be gone: Lord, I accept thine offered grace, I bow before thy throne.  3 Now cleanse my soul from every sin, By my Redeemer's blood: Now let my flesh and soul begin The honours of my God.  4 Let me no more my soul beguile With sin's deceitful toys: Let cheerful hope increasing still Approach to heavenly joys.  5 My thankful lips shall loud proclaim The wonders of thy praise, And spread the savour of thy Name Where'er I spend my days.  6 On earth let my example shine, And when I leave this state, May heaven receive this soul of mine To bliss supremely great.   Hymn 1:45. The last judgment, Rev. 21. 5-8.  1 See where the great incarnate God Fills a majestic throne, While from the skies his awful voice Bears the last judgment down.  2 [\"I am the first, and I the last, \"Thro' endless years the same; \"I AM is my memorial still, \"And my eternal name.  3 \"Such favours as a God can give \"My royal grace bestows; \"Ye thirsty souls come taste the streams \"Where life and pleasure flows.]  4 [\"The saint that triumphs o'er his sins, \"I'll own him for a son, \"The whole creation shall reward \"The conquests he has won.  5 \"But bloody hands and hearts unclean, \"And all the lying race, \"The faithless and the scoffing crew, \"That spurn at offer'd grace,  6 \"They shall be taken from my sight, \"Bound fast in iron chains, \"And headlong plung'd into the lake \"Where fire and darkness reigns.\"  7 O may I stand before the Lamb, When earth and seas are fled! And hear the Judge pronounce my name With blessings on my head!  8 May I with those for ever dwell Who here were my delight, While sinners banish'd down to hell, No more offend my sight.   Hymn 1:46. [Supplement.] The privileges of the living above the dead.  1 Awake, my zeal, awake, my love, To serve my Saviour here below, In works which perfect saints above And holy angels cannot do.  2 Awake my charity, to feed The hungry soul, and clothe the poor: In heaven are found no sons of need, There all these duties are no more.  3 Subdue thy passions, O my soul! Maintain the fight, thy work pursue, Daily thy rising sins control, And be thy victories ever new.  4 The land of triumph lies on high, There are no foes t' encounter there: Lord, I would conquer till I die, And finish all the glorious war.  5 Let every flying hour confess I gain thy gospel fresh renown; And when my life and labour cease, May I possess the promis'd crown.   Hymn 1:47. [Supplement.] Death of kindred improved.  1 Must friends and kindred drop and die? And helpers be withdrawn? While sorrow with a weeping eye Counts up our comforts gone?  2 Be thou our comfort, mighty God! Our helper and our friend: Nor leave us in this dangerous road, Till all our trials end.  3 O may our feet pursue the way Our pious fathers led! With love and holy zeal obey The counsels of the dead.  4 Let us be wean'd from all below, Let hope our grief expel, While death invites our souls to go Where our best kindred dwell.   Hymn 1:48. The Christian race, Isa. 40. 28-31.  1 Awake, our souls, away, our fears, Let every trembling thought be gone; Awake and run the heavenly race, And put a cheerful courage on.  2 True, 'tis a strait and thorny road, And mortal spirits tire and faint; But they forget the mighty God That feeds the strength of every saint.  3 Thee, mighty God, whose matchless power Is ever new and ever young, And firm endures while endless years Their everlasting circles run.  4 From thee the overflowing spring, Our souls shall drink a fresh supply, While such as trust their native strength Shall melt away, and drop and die.  5 Swift as an eagle cuts the air We'll mount aloft to thine abode, On wings of love our souls shall fly, Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.   Hymn 1:49. The works of Moses and the Lamb, Rev. 15. 3.  1 How strong thine arm is, mighty God, Who would not fear thy Name! Jesus, how sweet thy graces are! Who would not love the Lamb!  2 He has done more than Moses did, Our Prophet and our King; From bonds of hell he freed our souls, And taught our lips to sing.  3 In the Red-sea by Moses' hand Th' Egyptian host was drown'd; But his own blood hides all our sins, And guilt no more is found.  4 When thro' the desert Israel went, With manna they were fed; Our Lord invites us to his flesh, And calls it living bread.  5 Moses beheld the promis'd land, Yet never reach'd the place; But Christ shall bring his followers home To see his Father's face.  6 Then shall our love and joy be full, And feel a warmer flame; And sweeter voices tune the song Of Moses and the Lamb.   Hymn 1:50. The song of Zacharias, and the message of John the Baptist; or, Light and salvation by Jesus Christ, Luke 1. 68 &c. John 1. 29. 32.  1 Now be the God of Israel bless'd Who makes his truth appear, His mighty hand fulfils his word, And all the oaths he sware.  2 Now he bedews old David's root With blessings from the skies; He makes the branch of promise grow, The promis'd horn arise.  3 [John was the prophet of the Lord To go before his face, The herald which our Saviour God Sent to prepare his ways.  4 He makes the great salvation known, He speaks of pardon'd sins; While grace divine and heavenly love In its own glory shines.  5 \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" he cries, \"That takes our guilt away: \"I saw the Spirit o'er his head \"On his baptizing day.]  6 \"Be every vale exalted high, \"Sink every mountain low, \"The proud must stoop, and humble souls \"Shall his salvation know.  7 \"The heathen realms with Israel's land \"Shall join in sweet accord; \"And all that's born of man shall see \"The glory of the Lord.  8 \"Behold the morning star arise, \"Ye that in darkness sit; \"He marks the path that leads to peace, \"And guides our doubtful feet.\"   Hymn 1:51. Persevering grace, Jude 24 25.  1 To God the only wise, Our Saviour and our King, Let all the saints below the skies Their humble praises bring.  2 'Tis his almighty love, His counsel, and his care, Preserves us safe from sin and death, And every hurtful snare.  3 He will present our souls Unblemish'd and complete, Before the glory of his face, With joys divinely great.  4 Then all the chosen seed Shall meet around the throne, Shall bless the conduct of his grace, And make his wonders known.  5 To our Redeemer God Wisdom and power belongs, Immortal crowns of majesty, And everlasting songs.   Hymn 1:52. Baptism, Matt. 28. 19. Acts 2. 38.  1 'Twas the commission of our Lord, \"Go, teach the nations, and baptize;\" The nations have receiv'd the word Since he ascended to the skies.  2 He sits upon th' eternal hills, With grace and pardon in his hands, And sends his covenant with the seals, To bless the distant British lands.  3 \"Repent, and be baptiz'd, (he saith) For the remission of your sins;\" And thus our sense assists our faith, And shews us what his gospel means.  4 Our souls he washes in his blood, As water makes the body clean; And the good Spirit from our God Descends like purifying rain.  5 Thus we engage ourselves to thee, And seal our covenant with the Lord: O may the great eternal Three In heaven our solemn vows record!   Hymn 1:53. The Holy Scriptures, Heb. 1. 1 2. 2 Tim. 3. 15 16. Psalm 147. 19 20.  1 God who in various methods told His mind and will to saints of old, Sent down his Son, with truth and grace, To teach us in these latter days.  2 Our nation reads the written word, That book of life, that sure record: The bright inheritance of heaven Is by the sweet conveyance given.  3 God's kindest thoughts are here express'd, Able to make us wise and bless'd; The doctrines are divinely true, Fit for reproof, and comfort too.  4 Ye British isles, who read his love In long epistles from above, (He hath not sent his sacred word To every land) Praise ye the Lord.   Hymn 1:54. Electing grace; or, Saints beloved in Christ, Eph. 1. 3 &c.  1 Jesus, we bless thy Father's Name; Thy God and ours are both the same: What heavenly blessings from his throne Flow down to sinners thro' his Son!  2 \"Christ be my first elect,\" he said, Then chose our souls in Christ our head, Before he gave the mountains birth, Or laid foundations for the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],["title","Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#5)"],["body","earth.  3 Thus did eternal love begin To raise us up from death and sin; Our characters were then decreed, \"Blameless in love, a holy seed.\"  4 Predestinated to be sons, Born by degrees, but chose at once; A new regenerated race To praise the glory of his grace.  5 With Christ our Lord we share our part In the affections of his heart, Nor shall our souls be thence remov'd Till he forgets his first belov'd.   Hymn 1:55. Hesekiah's song; or, Sickness and recovery, Isa. 38.9 &c.  1 When we are rais'd from deep distress Our God deserves a song; We take the pattern of our praise From Hezekiah's tongue.  2 The gates of the devouring grave Are open'd wide in vain, If he that holds the keys of death Commands them fast again.  3 Pains of the flesh are wont t' abuse Our minds with slavish fears, \"Our days are past, and we shall lose \"The remnant of our years.\"  4 We chatter with a swallow's voice, Or like a dove we mourn, With bitterness instead of joys, Afflicted and forlorn.  5 Jehovah speaks the healing word, And no disease withstands; Fevers and plagues obey the Lord, And fly at his commands.  6 If half the strings of life should break, He can our frame restore; He casts our sins behind his back, And they are found no more.   Hymn 1:56. The song of Moses and the Lamb; or, Babylon falling, Rev. 15. 3. and chap. 16. 19. and 17. 6.  1 We sing the glories of thy love, We sound thy dreadful Name; The Christian church unites the songs Of Moses and the Lamb.  2 Great God, how wondrous are thy works Of vengeance and of grace! Thou King of saints, Almighty Lord, How just and true thy ways!  3 Who dares refuse to fear thy Name, Or worship at thy throne? Thy judgments speak thine holiness Thro' all the nations known.  4 Great Babylon, that rules the earth, Drunk with the martyrs' blood, Her crimes shall speedily awake The fury of our God.  5 The cup of wrath is ready mix'd, And she must drink the dregs; Strong is the Lord her sovereign Judge, And shall fulfil the plagues.   Hymn 1:57. Original sin; or, The first and second Adam, Rom. 5. 12. Psalm 51. 5. Job 11. 4.  1 Backward with humble shame we look On our original; How is our nature dash'd and broke In our first father's fall!  2 To all that's good averse and blind, But prone to all that's ill What dreadful darkness veils our mind! How obstinate our will!  3 [Conceiv'd in sin (O wretched state!) Before we draw our breath, The first young pulse begins to beat Iniquity and death.  4 How strong in our degenerate blood The old corruption reigns, And, mingling with the crooked flood, Wanders thro' all our veins!]  5 Wild and unwholesome as the root Will all the branches be; How can we hope for living fruit From such a deadly tree?  6 What mortal power from things unclean Can pure productions bring? Who can command a vital stream From an infected spring?]  7 Yet, mighty God, thy wondrous love Can make our nature clean, While Christ and grace prevail above The tempter, death, and sin.  8 The second Adam shall restore The ruins of the first, Hosanna to that sovereign power That new creates our dust.   Hymn 1:58. The devil vanquished; or, Michael's war with the dragon, Rev. 12. 7.  1 Let mortal tongues attempt to sing The wars of heaven, when Michael stood Chief general of th' Eternal King, And fought the battles of our God.  2 Against the dragon and his host The armies of the Lord prevail: In vain they rage, in vain they boast, Their courage sinks, their weapons fail.  3 Down to the earth was Satan thrown, Down to the earth his legions fell; Then was the trump of triumph blown, And shook the dreadful deeps of hell.  4 Now is the hour of darkness past, Christ hath assum'd his reigning power; Behold the great accuser cast Down from the skies, to rise no more.  5 'Twas by thy blood immortal Lamb, Thine armies trod the tempter down; 'Twas by thy word and powerful Name, They gain'd the battle and renown.  6 Rejoice, ye heavens; let every star Shine with new glories round the sky; Saints, while ye sing the heavenly war, Raise your Deliverer's name on high.   Hymn 1:59. Babylon fallen, Rev. 18. 20 21.  1 In Gabriel's hand a mighty stone Lies, a fair type of Babylon ''Prophets, rejoice, and, all ye saints, \"God shall avenge your long complaints.\"  2 He said, and dreadful as he stood, He sunk the milstone in the flood: \"Thus terribly shall Babel fall; \"Thus, and no more be found at all.\"   Hymn 1:60. The virgin Mary's song; or, The promised Messiah born, Luke 1. 46 &c.  1 Our souls shall magnify the Lord, In God the Saviour we rejoice; While we repeat the Virgin's song, May the same spirit tune our voice.  2 [The Highest saw her low estate, And mighty things his hand hath done: His overshadowing power and grace Makes her the mother of his Son.  3 Let every nation call her bless'd, And endless years prolong her fame; But God alone must be ador'd; Holy and reverend is his Name.]  4 To those that fear and trust the Lord His mercy stands for ever sure: From age to age his promise lives, And the performance is secure.  5 He spake to Abr'am and his seed, \"In thee shall all the earth be bless'd;\" The memory of that ancient word Lay long in his eternal breast.  6 But now no more shall Israel wait, No more the Gentiles lie forlorn: Lo the desire of nations comes, Behold the promis'd seed is born.   Hymn 1:61. Christ our high Priest and King, and Christ coming to judgment, Rev. 1. 5 6 7.  1 Now to the Lord that makes us know The wonders of his dying love, Be humble honours paid below, And strains of nobler praise above.  2 'Twas he that cleans'd our foulest sins, And wash'd us in his richest blood; 'Tis he that makes us priests and kings, And brings us rebels near to God.  3 To Jesus our atoning priest, To Jesus our superior king, Be everlasting power confess'd, And every tongue his glory sing.  4 Behold, on flying clouds he comes, And every eye shall see him move; Tho' with our sins we pierc'd him once, Then he displays his pardoning love.  5 The unbelieving world shall wail While we rejoice to see the day: Come, Lord; nor let thy promise fail, Nor let thy chariots long delay.   Hymn 1:62. Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, worshipped by all the creation, Rev. 5. 11 12 13.  1 Come let us join our cheerful songs With angels round the throne; Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, But all their joys are one.  2 \"Worthy the Lamb that dy'd,\" they cry, \"To be exalted thus:\" \"Worthy the Lamb,\" our lips reply, \"For he was slain for us.\"  3 Jesus is worthy to receive Honour and power divine; And blessings more than we can give, Be, Lord, for ever thine.  4 Let all that dwell above the sky, And air, and earth, and seas, Conspire to lift thy glories high, And speak thine endless praise.  5 The whole creation join in one To bless the sacred Name Of him that sits upon the throne, And to adore the Lamb.   Hymn 1:63. Christ's humiliation and exaltation, Rev. 5. 12.  1 What equal honours shall we bring To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb, When all the notes that angels sing Are far inferior to thy Name?  2 Worthy is he that once was slain, The Prince of Peace that groan'd and dy'd, Worthy to rise, and live, and reign At his Almighty Father's side.  3 Power and dominion are his due, Who stood condemn'd at Pilate's bar: Wisdom belongs to Jesus too, Tho' he was charg'd with madness here.  4 All riches are his native right, Yet he sustain'd amazing loss: To him ascribe eternal might, Who left his weakness on the cross.  5 Honour immortal must be paid, Instead of scandal and of scorn: While glory shines around his head, And a bright crown without a thorn.  6 Blessings for ever on the Lamb, Who bore the curse for wretched men: Let angels sound his sacred Name, And every creature say, Amen.   Hymn 1:64. Adoption, 1 John 3. 1 &c. Gal. 4. 6.  1 Behold what wondrous grace The Father hath bestow'd On sinners of a mortal race, To call them sons of God!  2 'Tis no surprising thing That we should be unknown; The Jewish world knew not their King, God's everlasting Son.  3 Nor doth it yet appear How great we must be made; But when we see our Saviour here, We shall be like our head.  4 A hope so much divine May trials well endure, May purge our souls from sense and sin, As Christ the Lord is pure.  5 If in my Father's love I share a filial part, Send down thy Spirit like a dove To rest upon my heart.  6 We would no longer lie Like slaves beneath the throne; My faith shall Abba, Father, cry, And thou the kindred own.   Hymn 1:65. The kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of our Lord; or, The day of judgment, Rev. 11. 15-18.  1 Let the seventh angel sound on high, Let shouts be heard thro' all the sky; Kings of the earth, with glad accord Give up your kingdoms to the Lord.  2 Almighty God, thy power assume, Who wast, and art, and art to come: Jesus, the Lamb, who once was slain, For ever live, for ever reign.  3 The angry nations fret and roar, That they can slay the saints no more; On wings of vengeance flies our God To pay the long arrears of blood.  4 Now must the rising dead appear, Now the decisive sentence hear; Now the dear martyrs of the Lord Receive an infinite reward.   Hymn 1:66. Christ the King at his table, Cant. (Transcriber's Note: Song of Solomon) 1. 2-5 12 13 17.  1 Let him embrace my soul, and prove Mine interest in his heavenly love: The voice that tells me, \"Thou art mine,\" Exceeds the blessings of the vine.  2 On thee th' anointing Spirit came, And spreads the savour of thy name; That oil of gladness and of grace Draws virgin souls to meet thy face.  3 Jesus, allure me by thy charms, My soul shall fly into thine arms, Our wandering feet thy favours bring To the fair chambers of the King.  4 [Wonder and pleasure tune our voice To speak thy praises and our joys: Our memory keeps this love of thine Beyond the taste of richest wine.]  5 Tho' in ourselves deform'd we are, And black as Kedar tent appear, Yet when we put thy beauties on, Fair as the courts of Solomon.  6 While at his table sits the King, He loves to"]]]
