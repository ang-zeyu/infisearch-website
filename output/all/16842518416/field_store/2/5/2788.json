Of course, the ideal condition cannot always be obtained, in which case you must do the best you can. The idea is that you should be able to abstract yourself, so far as is possible, from distracting impressions, and you should be alone with yourself--in communion with your Real Self.  It is well to place yourself in an easy chair, or on a couch, so that you may relax the muscles and free the tension of your nerves. You should be able to \"let go\" all over, allowing every muscle to become limp, until a feeling of perfect peace and restful calm permeates every particle of your being. Rest the body and calm the mind. This condition is best in the earlier stages of the practice, although after the Candidate has acquired a degree of mastery he will be able to obtain the physical relaxation and mental calm whenever and wherever he desires.  But he must guard against acquiring a \"dreamy\" way of going around, wrapped in meditation when he should be attending to the affairs of life. _Remember this_, the State of Meditation should be entirely under the control of the Will, and should be entered into only deliberately and at the proper times. The Will must be master of this, as well as of every other mental state. The Initiates are not \"day dreamers,\" but men and women having full control of themselves and their moods. The \"I\" consciousness while developed by meditation and consciousness, soon becomes a fixed item of consciousness, and does not have to be produced by meditation. In time of trial, doubt, or trouble, the consciousness may be brightened by an effort of the Will (as we shall explain in subsequent lessons) without going into the State of Meditation.  THE REALIZATION OF THE \"I.\" The Candidate must first acquaint himself with the reality of the \"I,\" before he will be able to learn its real nature. This is the first step. Let the Candidate place himself in the State of Meditation, as heretofore described. Then let him concentrate his entire attention upon his Individual Self, shutting out all thought of the outside world, and other persons. Let him form in his mind the idea of himself as a _real_ thing--an actual being--an individual entity--a Sun around which revolves the world. He must see himself as the Centre around which the whole world revolves. Let not a false modesty, or sense of depreciation interfere with this idea, for you are not denying the right of others to also consider themselves centres. You are, in fact, a centre of consciousness--made so by the Absolute--and you are awakening to the fact. Until the Ego recognizes itself as a Centre of Thought, Influence and Power, it will not be able to _manifest_ these qualities. And in proportion as it recognizes its position as a centre, so will it be able to manifest its qualities. It is not necessary that you should compare yourself with others, or imagine yourself greater or higher than them. In fact, such comparisons are to be regretted, and are unworthy of the advanced Ego, being a mark and indication of a lack of development, rather than the reverse. In the Meditation simply ignore all consideration of the respective qualities of others, and endeavor to realize the fact that YOU are a great Centre of Consciousness--a Centre of Power--a Centre of Influence--a Centre of Thought. And that like the planets circling around the sun, so does your world revolve around YOU who are its centre. It will not be necessary for you to argue out this matter, or to convince yourself of its truth by intellectual reasoning. The knowledge does not come in that way. It comes in the shape of a realization of the truth gradually dawning upon your consciousness through meditation and concentration. Carry this thought of yourself as a \"Centre of Consciousness--Influence--Power\" with you, _for it is an occult truth,_ and in the proportion that you are able, to realize it so will be your ability to manifest the qualities named.  No matter how humble may be your position--no matter how hard may be your lot--no matter how deficient in educational advantages you may be--still you would not change your \"I\" with the most fortunate, wisest and highest man or woman in the world. You may doubt this, but think for a moment and you will see that we are right. When you say that you \"would like to be\" this person or that, you really mean that _you_ would like to have their degree of intelligence, power, wealth, position, or what not. What you want is something that is theirs, or something akin to it. But you would not for a moment wish to merge your _identity_ with theirs, or to exchange _selves_. Think of this for a moment To _be_ the other person you would have to let _yourself_ die, and instead of _yourself_ you would be the other person. The real _you_ would be wiped out of existence, and you would not be _you_ at all, but would be _he_.  If you can but grasp this idea you will see that not for a moment would you be willing for such an exchange. Of course such an exchange is impossible. The \"I\" of you cannot be wiped out. It is eternal, and will go on, and on, and on, to higher and higher states--but it always will be the same \"I.\" Just as you, although a far different sort of person from your childhood self, still you recognize that the same \"I\" is there, and always has been there. And although you will attain knowledge, experience, power and wisdom in the coming years, the same \"I\" will be there. The \"I\" is the Divine Spark and cannot be extinguished.  The majority of people in the present stage of the race development have but a faint conception of the reality of the \"I.\" They accept the statement of its existence, and are conscious of themselves as an eating, sleeping, living creature--something like a higher form of animal. But they have not awakened to an \"awareness\" or realization of the \"I,\" which must come to all who become real centres of Influence and Power. Some men have stumbled into this consciousness, or a degree of it, without understanding the matter. They have \"felt\" the truth of it, and they have stepped out from the ranks of the commonplace people of the world, and have become powers for good or bad. This is unfortunate to some extent, as this \"awareness\" without the knowledge that should accompany it may bring pain to the individual and others.  The Candidate must meditate upon the \"I,\" and recognize it--_feel_ it--to be a Centre. This is his first task. Impress upon your mind the word \"I,\" in this sense and understanding, and let it sink deep down into your consciousness, so that it will become a part of you. And when you say \"I,\" you must accompany the word with the picture of your Ego as a Centre of Consciousness, and Thought, and Power, and Influence. See yourself thus, surrounded by your world. Wherever you go, there goes the Centre of your world. YOU are the Centre, and all outside of you revolves around that Centre. This is the first great lesson on the road to Initiation. Learn it!  The Yogi Masters teach the Candidates that their realization of the \"I\" as a Centre may be hastened by going into the Silence, or State of Meditation, and repeating their first name over slowly, deliberately and solemnly a number of times. This exercise tends to cause the mind to centre upon the \"I,\" and many cases of dawning Initiation have resulted from this practice. Many original thinkers have stumbled upon this method, without having been taught it. A noted example is that of Lord Tennyson, who has written that he attained a degree of Initiation in this way. He would repeat his own name, over and over, and the same time meditating upon his identity, and he reports that he would become conscious and \"aware\" of his reality and immortality--in short would recognize himself as a _real_ center of consciousness.  We think we have given you the key to the first stage of meditation and concentration. Before passing on, let us quote from one of the old Hindu Masters. He says, regarding this matter: \"When the soul sees itself as a Centre surrounded by its circumference--when the Sun knows that it is a Sun, and is surrounded by its whirling planets--then is it ready for the Wisdom and Power of the Masters.\"  THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE \"I\" FROM THE BODY. Many of the Candidates find themselves prevented from a full realization of the \"I\" (even after they have begun to grasp it) by the confusing of the reality of the \"I\" with the sense of the physical body. This is a stumbling block that is easily overcome by meditation and concentration, the independence of the \"I\" often becoming manifest to the Candidate in a flash, upon the proper thought being used as the subject of meditation.  The exercise is given as follows: Place yourself in the State of Meditation, and think of YOURSELF--the Real \"I\"--as being independent of the body, but using the body as a covering and an instrument. Think of the body as you might of a suit of clothes. Realize that you are able to leave the body, and still be the same \"I.\" Picture yourself as doing this, and looking down upon your body. Think of the body as a shell from which you may emerge without affecting your identity. Think of yourself as mastering and controlling the body that you occupy, and using it to the best advantage, making it healthy, strong and vigorous, but still being merely a shell or covering for the real \"You.\" Think of the body as composed of atoms and cells which are constantly changing, but which are held together by the force of your Ego, and which you can improve at Will. Realize that you are merely inhabiting the body, and using it for your convenience, just as you might use a house.  In meditating further, ignore the body entirely, and place your thought upon the Real \"I\" that you are beginning to feel to be \"you,\" and you will find that your identity--your \"I\"--is something entirely apart from the body. You may now say \"my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],["title","A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#3)"],["body","y\" with a new meaning. Divorce the idea of your being a physical being, and realize that you are above body. But do not let this conception and realization cause you to ignore the body. You must regard the body as the Temple of the Spirit, and care for it, and make it a fit habitation for the \"I.\" Do not be frightened if, during this meditation, you happen to experience the sensation of being out of the body for a few moments, and of returning to it when you are through with the exercise. The Ego is able (in the case of the advanced Initiate) of soaring above the confines of the body, but it never severs its connection at such times. It is merely as if one were to look out of the window of a room, seeing what was going on outside, and drawing in his head when he wishes. He does not leave the room, although he may place his head outside in order to observe what is doing in the street. We do not advise the Candidate to try to cultivate this sensation--but if it comes naturally during meditation, do not fear.  REALIZING THE IMMORTALITY AND INVINCIBILITY OF THE EGO. While the majority accept on faith the belief in the Immortality of the Soul, yet but few are aware that it may be demonstrated by the soul itself. The Yogi Masters teach the Candidates this lesson, as follows: The Candidate places himself in the State of Meditation, or at least in a thoughtful frame of mind, and then endeavors to \"imagine\" himself as \"dead\"--that is, he tries to form a mental conception of himself as dead. This, at first thought, appears a very easy thing to imagine, but as a matter of fact it is _impossible_ to do so, for the Ego refuses to entertain the proposition, and finds it impossible to imagine it. Try it for yourself. You will find that you may be able to imagine your _body_ as lying still and lifeless, but the same thought finds that in so doing _You_ are standing and looking at the body. So you see that _You_ are not dead at all, even in imagination, although the body may be. Or, if you refuse to disentangle yourself from your body, in imagination, you may think of your body as dead but _You_ who refuse to leave it are still _alive_ and recognize the dead body as a thing apart from your Real Self. No matter how you may twist it you _cannot_ imagine yourself as dead. The Ego insists upon being _alive_ in any of these thoughts, and thus finds that it has within itself the sense and assurance of Immortality. In case of sleep or stupor resulting from a blow, or from narcotics or anaesthetics, the mind is apparently blank, but the \"I\" is conscious of a continuity of existence. And so one may imagine himself as being in an unconscious state, or asleep, quite easily, and sees the possibility of such a state, but when it comes to imagining the \"I\" as dead, the mind utterly refuses to do the work. This wonderful fact that the soul carries within itself the evidence of its own immortality is a glorious thing, but one must have reached a degree of unfoldment before he is able to grasp its full significance.  The Candidate is advised to investigate the above statement for himself, by meditation and concentration, for in order that the \"I\" may know its true nature and possibilities, it must realize that it cannot be destroyed or killed. It must know what it is before it is able to manifest its nature. So do not leave this part of the teaching until you have mastered it. And it is well occasionally to return to it, in order that you may impress upon the mind the fact of your immortal and eternal nature. The mere glimmering of this conception of truth will give you an increased sense of strength and power, and you will find that your Self has expanded and grown, and that you are more of a power and Centre than you have heretofore realized.  The following exercises are useful in bringing about a realization of the invincibility of the Ego--its superiority to the elements.  Place yourself in the State of Meditation, and imagine the \"I\" as withdrawn from the body. See it passing through the tests of air, fire and water unharmed. The body being out of the way, the soul is seen to be able of passing through the air at will--of floating like a bird--of soaring--of traveling in the ether. It may be seen as able to pass through fire without harm and without sensation, for the elements affect only the physical body, not the Real \"I.\" Likewise it may be seen as passing through water without discomfort or danger or hurt.  This meditation will give you a sense of superiority and strength, and will show you something of the nature of the real \"I.\" It is true that you are confined in the body, and the body may be affected by the elements, but the knowledge that the Real \"I\" is superior to the body--superior to the elements that affect the body--and cannot be injured any more than it can be killed, is wonderful, and tends to develop the full \"I\" consciousness within you. For You--the Real \"I\"--are not body. You are Spirit. The Ego is Immortal and Invincible, and cannot be killed and harmed. When you enter into this realization and consciousness, you will feel an influx of strength and power impossible to describe. Fear will fall from you like a worn-out cloak, and you will feel that you are \"born again.\" An understanding of this thought, will show you that the things that we have been fearing cannot affect the Real \"I,\" but must rest content with hurting the physical body. And they may be warded off from the physical body by a proper understanding and application of the Will.  In our next lesson, you will be taught how to separate the \"I\" from the mechanism of the mind--how you may realize your mastery of the mind, just as you now realize your independence of the body. This knowledge must be imparted to you by degrees, and you must place your feet firmly upon one round of the ladder before you take the next step.  The watchword of this First Lesson is \"I.\" And the Candidate must enter fully into its meaning before he is able to progress. He must realize his real existence--independent of the body. He must see himself as invincible and impervious to harm, hurt, or death. He must see himself as a great Centre of Consciousness--a Sun around which his world revolves. Then will come to him a new strength. He will feel a calm dignity and power, which will be apparent to those with whom he comes in contact. He will be able to look the world in the face without flinching, and without fear, for he will realize the nature and power of the \"I.\" He will realize that he is a Centre of Power--of Influence. He will realize that nothing can harm the \"I,\" and that no matter how the storms of life may dash upon the personality, the real \"I\"--the Individuality--is unharmed. Like a rock that stands steadfast throughout the storm, so does the \"I\" stand through the tempests of the life of personality. And he will know that as he grows in realization, he will be able to control these storms and bid them be still.  In the words of one of the Yogi Masters: \"The 'I' is eternal. It passes unharmed through the fire, the air, the water. Sword and spear cannot kill or wound it. It cannot die. The trials of the physical life are but as dreams to it. Resting secure in the knowledge of the 'I,' Man may smile at the worst the world has to offer, and raising his hand he may bid them disappear into the mist from which they emerged. Blessed is he who can say (understandingly) 'I'.\"  So dear Candidate, we leave you to master the First Lesson. Be not discouraged if your progress be slow. Be not cast down if you slip back a step after having gained it. You will gain two at the next step. Success and realization will be yours. Mastery is before. You will Attain. You will Accomplish. Peace be with you.   MANTRAMS (AFFIRMATIONS) FOR THE FIRST LESSON.  \"I\" am a Centre. Around me revolves my world.  \"I\" am a Centre of Influence and Power.  \"I\" am a Centre of Thought and Consciousness.  \"I\" am Independent of the Body.  \"I\" am Immortal and cannot be Destroyed.  \"I\" am Invincible and cannot be Injured.  [Illustration: \"I\"]     THE SECOND LESSON.  THE EGO'S MENTAL TOOLS.   In the First Lesson we gave instruction and exercises designed to awaken the consciousness of the Candidate to a realization of the real \"I.\" We confined our instructions to the preliminary teachings of the reality of the \"I,\" and the means whereby the Candidate might be brought to a realization of his real Self, and its independence from the body and the things of the flesh. We tried to show you how you might awaken to a consciousness of the reality of the \"I\"; its real nature; its independence of the body; its immortality; its invincibility and invulnerability. How well we have succeeded may be determined only by the experience of each Candidate, for we can but point out the way, and the Candidate must do the real work himself.  But there is more to be said and done in this matter of awakening to a realization of the \"I.\" So far, we have but told you how to distinguish between the material coverings of the Ego and the \"I\" itself. We have tried to show you that you had a real \"I,\" and then to show you what it was, and how it was independent of the material coverings, etc. But there is still another step in this self analysis--a more difficult step. Even when the Candidate has awakened to a realization of his independence of the body, and material coverings, he often confounds the \"I\" with the lower principles of the mind. This is a mistake. The Mind, in its various phases and planes, is but a tool and instrument of the \"I,\" and is far from being the \"I\" itself. We shall try to bring out this fact in this lesson and its accompanying exercises. We shall avoid, and pass by, the metaphysical features of the case, and shall confine ourselves to the Yogi Psychology. We shall not touch upon theories, nor attempt to explain the cause, nature and purpose of the Mind--the working tool of the Ego--but instead shall attempt to point out a"]]]
