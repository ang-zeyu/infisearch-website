At all events, thou wilt go to confession and get thy soul in order--betake thyself to thy holy gear--men fight none the worse for a clear conscience. And I would ask the intercession of St. Michael--men speak well of him in Brittany, and tell how he fought a combat a outrance with Satan, wherein the latter came off none the better man.\"  \"I shall see Father Elphege tonight--we are not heathen, we English.\"  \"Ah! here comes Louis. Well, what news dost thou bring?\"  \"Good ones. Our lord permits the fight. You should have seen how stark and stern he looked when he saw his son's eyes. Wilfred, thou hast a fist like a smith. Wilt thou do as well with the sword?\"  \"Tomorrow will show.\"  \"Well, it is quite right of thee to fight for thine own serfs; I would have fought for mine at Marmontier--none should have come between me and them. And I am glad we did not hurt the poor knave. Etienne will be a hard lord for thy people, if anything happens to thee.\"  Oh, how the memory of his mother and her counsels came before the poor orphan.  Still, how could he help it? He had done rightly, he felt sure; and he knew that his father would say so were hecums alive.  \"And so would my grandfather,\" thought he, \"once the friend of the Ironside, of whose wondrous exploits he often told me in olden days around our winter fire. Would his spirit were with me now, and a little of his skill in arms.\"  And thus musing, he arrived at the castle and betook himself, with Pierre, to the tilt yard. Louis went off to seek Etienne, whose second he was to be.    CHAPTER VI. A REVELATION.   The night was growing dark when Wilfred approached the priory, with the intention of seeking Father Elphege, and putting, as Pierre had said, \"his spiritual gear in order.\"  As we have remarked in other pages, men then attached no notion of sin to the mere act of fighting--there could not be a duty clearer to Christians of that strange epoch than to fight with each other whensoever the exigencies of society demanded--the very institution of knighthood was bound up with the idea.  So he had no anticipation that the good father would say, \"Don't fight.\"  But when he approached the great door of the priory, with the venerable figure of the patron saint bending over the archway, a messenger--a lay brother--issued forth.  It was almost dark, but the man recognised Wilfred.  \"Is it thou, Wilfred of Aescendune, in the flesh?\"  \"I am he.\"  \"Then I am glad to see thee, for thus my limbs are saved the toil of seeking thee, and my rheumatics make me dread the night air.\"  \"Seeking me?\"  \"Yes, verily; the good prior desireth thee earnestly, and adjured me to fetch thee without delay; and lo! Saint Cuthbert hath sent thee.\"  What could the prior want of him? thought the lad; had he heard of the quarrel, through young Eadwin, and did he disapprove of it?  At all events, he would be saved the trouble of many words; and he entered.  He passed along the cloister, with its ceiling of carved wood and its rude wooden crucifix at the end thereof; he looked out at the little green square of grass, enclosed by the quadrangle, wherein reposed in peace the monks of former generations. Once the thought flashed over him, that a similar little grassy hillock might, ere a few hours were over, be raised above his own earthly remains; but that did not shake his purpose.  He ascended a spiral staircase and entered the prior's own cell.  \"What, Wilfred! and so soon? Sooth to say, my messenger hath sped.\"  \"He met me just outside the gate, father.\"  \"By the blessing of heaven, my son.\"  \"But why hast thou sent for me, and why this haste?\"  \"A dying man wishes to see thee--nay, do not start! he has a sad confession to make--one it will harrow thy blood to hear, and he cannot die in peace without thy forgiveness.\"  \"My forgiveness! How has he injured me? He is a Norman, I suppose?\"  \"Nay, he belongeth not to the proud race of our oppressors; he is an old serf of thy house. Dost thou remember Beorn the woodman?\"  \"Who slew the deer and sold them in secret, and when the deed was discovered, fled?\"  \"The same; it is he.\"  \"But what harm hath he done so great that he should come here to ask forgiveness? 'Twas a small matter; at least, it seems so now.\"  \"My son, that is not the matter he hath to confess.\"  \"What is it, then?\"  \"Prepare thyself, my dear child; now be composed; you must resign yourself to God's will.\"  \"Tell me, father, and end this suspense. What is amiss?\"  \"Nay, he must do that; I wanted to prepare thee; but tis about thy mother.\"  Wilfred turned pale at once and trembled, for the one passion which divided his soul with hatred to the Normans was love for the memory of his parents. What had the man got to say about his mother?  \"But this is not constancy and firmness--thou quakest like an aspen leaf.\"  \"Tell me, was aught amiss in my mother's death?\"  \"Didst thou ever suspect it?\"  \"Yes, but I put the thought away, as though it came from Satan.\"  \"Well, poor child, thou wilt know now, and God help thee to bear it rightly.\"  Trembling and astonished, Wilfred followed the prior into an adjoining cell, where, propped up by cushions, lay the attenuated form of a dying man--the death sweat already on his brow, standing thereon in beads--the limbs rigid as a recent convulsion had left them.  Any one conversant in the signs which immediately precede death could have told that he had but a short time to live. The good monk, who was supporting him and breathing words of Christian hope into his ears, left him as the prior and Wilfred entered.  The prior took the monk's place, and supported the head of the penitent.  \"Look,\" he said, as he raised him upon his arm, \"Wilfred of Aescendune, the son of thy late lord.\"  The poor wretch groaned--such a deep hollow groan.  \"Canst thou forgive me?\" he said.  \"Forgive thee what?\"  \"Tell him all, my son, and ease thy burdened mind.\"  The thrall then spake, in words interrupted by gasps and sighs, which we must needs omit as we piece his narrative together for the benefit of our readers.  \"It is five years since I fled thy father's face, fearing his wrath, for I had slain his red deer and sold them for filthy lucre. Woe is me! I had better have trusted to his mercy and borne my fitting punishment; but, as Satan tempted me, I fled to the great city, where men are crowded together thick as bees in swarming time, to hide myself amongst many. There I was like to starve, and none gave me to eat, when a Jew who saw my distress, took pity on me and gave me shelter.  \"His name was Abraham of Toledo, a city far off over the salt sea, whence he had come to our English shores in the hope of gain; and he was mighty in magic arts and in compounding of deadly drugs to slay, or medicines to make alive. I became his servant, for I had nought else to do, and I blew his forge when he mixed strange metals, swept his chamber, mixed his medicines as ordered, and did all an ignorant man might do at his master's bidding.\"  \"The wretch! he should be burnt,\" said the prior, who, like most Englishmen of his day, confounded all such researches with the black art; \"didst thou ever see the devil there?\"  \"I did, indeed!\"--the prior started--\"but it was a Norman fiend, and his name Hugo of Aescendune.\"  \"How!\" Wilfred exclaimed, as he started violently.  \"Silence, dear son, thou shalt soon hear,\" said Father Elphege. \"Summon thy courage.\"  \"One evening I was mixing some drugs in my master's laboratory, in a recess hidden from the rest of the room by a curtain, which happened to be drawn, when my master entered the room in company with a stranger.  \"'Here, then, is the drug you seek; but it will be very costly--men must pay dear for vengeance,' said Abraham of Toledo.  \"'It may not be vengeance, but an obstacle which I wish to remove from my path.'  \"'That liquid was distilled by myself from many strange plants in far-off Araby; I may never replace it, and it is worth many pieces of gold.'  \"'Thou shalt have them if thou wilt swear, thou dog of a Jew, that it possesses all the qualities thou hast said. If it fails, look to thyself; I am not one to be played with.'  \"'The victim who takes but one drop daily shall decline and die within the half of a year; in half that time if the dose be doubled; a quarter if quadrupled.'  \"'And no one shall detect the cause?'  \"'Call the most learned physicians ye Christians have (dolts are they all), and they shall call it a natural death--consumption--so gradually shall the patient wear away.'  \"'I will trust thee; here is the gold.'  \"I had seen the man's face through the curtain; but no sooner was he gone than my master descended the stairs, calling for me. I managed to reach him without raising his suspicion, and he pointed out the figure of his visitor receding in the distant gloom of the street.  \"'Follow and learn who he is.'  \"I followed and dogged him to his lodging--it was the present lord of Aescendune.  \"I knew of his marriage--I felt sure whom he wanted to destroy; yet I did not dare show myself at Aescendune, even to save so innocent a life--the life of so sweet and good a lady as she had ever been. But at length disease--an incurable disease--seized me, and the dread of approaching death and judgment has brought me to tell what it freezes my heart to say--all too late to save, but not perhaps to avenge--I tell thee thy mother was poisoned, O Wilfred of Aescendune!\"  \"Tell me what would be the signs of the drug?\"  \"If dropped in water, it would, although colourless, impart a blue tinge to the liquid.\"  Wilfred hid his face in his hands and sobbed aloud.  \"Dost thou forgive me?\" said the dying thrall.  \"Thou mightest have saved her, yet I do forgive thee.\"  \"I might; it was my sin, and she was my liege lady, the gentlest and kindest.\"  \"Thou art forgiven; but oh! my father! who shall do justice on the murderer, the poisoner?\"  \"That is thy task; the son must avenge his mother's blood, and do justice on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13377"],["title","A tour through some parts of France, Switzerland, Savoy, Germany and Belgium, (#0)"],["body","Europe.

SIR,  Permit me to offer my most respectful thanks to Your Royal Highness, for the honor you have conferred upon me, by permitting the following pages to be inscribed to Your Royal Highness.  I beg at the same time to express my congratulations to Your Royal Highness on the late glorious events, which have distinguished Your Royal Highness's Government, which have restored to England the blessings of universal Peace, and will render the present æra ever memorable in History.      I have the Honor to be,     With the highest Respect,     Sir,     Your Royal Highness's     Obliged and most obedient Servant,      R.B.

Had the following Pages required the exertion either of superior judgment, or of abstruse research, the Author is not sufficiently vain to have submitted them to the notice of the Public.  They are therefore not recommended to the perusal of the critical reader; as in fact, they contain merely the hasty observations suggested by the scenes he visited in the course of his Tour, together with a few occasional remarks, which he thought might be acceptable to the generality of readers: since notwithstanding the late increase of travellers, the numbers are still very great, who, being prevented by business, or deterred by the inconveniences of travelling, from visiting the Continent, might be disposed to pardon some inaccuracies, should they meet with a small portion either of amusement or information.           *       *       *       *       *   CONTENTS.
