Singer), p. 10.]     CHAPTER IV  1714  \"THE SHEPHERD'S WEEK,\" \"A LETTER TO A LADY.\"   The outstanding literary event in Gay's career in 1714 was the pastoral, \"The Shepherd's Week,\" which was published by R. Burleigh on April 15th, which contained a \"Proeme to the Courteous Reader,\" and a \"Prologue to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Bolingbroke,\" which was, in fact, a dedication:--       Lo, I who erst beneath a tree   Sung Bumkinet and Bowzybee,   And Blouzelind and Marian bright,   In apron blue or apron white,   Now write my sonnets in a book,   For my good lord of Bolingbroke.  The author then states that he had heard of the Queen's illness and how the skill of Arbuthnot had restored her to health:--    A skilful leech (so God him speed)   They said had wrought this blessed deed,   This leech Arbuthnot was yclept,   Who many a night not once had slept;   But watch'd our gracious Sov'reign still:   For who could rest when she was ill?   O may'st thou henceforth sweetly sleep!   Shear, swains, oh shear your softest sheep   To swell his couch; for well I ween,   He saved the realm who saved his Queen.       Quoth I, please God, I'll his with glee   To court, this Arbuthnot to see.  Such loyalty, of course, the hardest heart must touch, but loyalty in this case had its reward, and the journey to Court was well worth the pains:--       There saw I ladies all a-row   Before their Queen in seemly show.   No more I'll sing Buxoma brown,   Like goldfinch in her Sunday gown;   Nor Clumsilis, nor Marian bright,   Nor damsel that Hobnelia hight.   But Lansdown fresh as flowers of May,   And Berkely lady blithe and gay,   And Anglesea, whose speech exceeds   The voice of pipe or oaten reeds;   And blooming Hyde, with eyes so rare,   And Montague beyond compare.   Such ladies fair wou'd I depaint   In roundelay or sonnet quaint.  But charming as were these ladies, there was still a better sight in store for the visitor:--       There saw I St. John, sweet of mien.   Full steadfast both to Church and Queen.   With whose fair name I'll deck my strain,   St. John, right courteous to the swain.       For thus he told me on a day,   Trim are thy sonnets, gentle Gay,   And certes, mirth it were to see   Thy joyous madrigals twice three,   With preface meet and notes profound.   Imprinted fair, and well y-bound.   All suddenly then home I sped,   And did ev'n as my Lord had said.  It was not Bolingbroke who inspired the pastorals, though he accepted the dedication. The true history of the origin of \"The Shepherd's Week\" is well set out by Mr. Underhill. \"These pastorals, it should be explained, were written at the instigation of Pope,\" he has written. \"The sixth volume of Tonson's 'Miscellany' had concluded with Pope's Pastorals and begun with those of Ambrose Philips. A few years after its publication a writer in the _Guardian_[1] (probably Tickell[2]) discussed the Pastoral in a series of papers, and gave the most extravagant praise to Philips. 'Theocritus,' he remarked, 'left his dominions to Virgil; Virgil left his to his son Spenser; and Spenser was succeeded by his eldest born, Philips.' Pope was not mentioned, and he set himself to redress the injustice by a device of characteristic subtlety. He wrote a sixth paper, in which he continued to illustrate the true principles of pastoral poetry from Philips' practice, but in such a way as to show the judicious reader by the examples given either the absurdity of Philips or the superior merit of Pope. The article was anonymously or pseudonymously forwarded to the _Guardian_, and was in due course published. Philips was furious, and providing himself with a birch rod, threatened to flog Pope. The latter, not content with his ingenious revenge, prevailed upon his friend Gay to continue the warfare and to burlesque Philips' performances in a series of realistic representations of country life.\"[3] Gay entered into the sport with joy--it was a game after his own heart, and one for which his talent was particularly fitted. He begins his \"Proeme to the Gentle Reader\" with a most palpable hit: \"Great marvel hath it been (and that not unworthily) to diverse worthy wits, that in this our island of Britain, in all rare sciences so greatly abounding, more especially in all kinds of poesie highly flourishing, no poet (though other ways of notable cunning in roundelays) hath hit on the right simple eclogue after this true ancient guise of Theocritus, before this mine attempt. Other Poet travelling in this plain highway of Pastoral I know none.\" Presently comes an attack but little disguised on Philips: \"Thou will not find my shepherdesses idly piping on oaten reeds, but milking the kine, tying up the sheaves, or if the hogs are astray driving them to their styes. My shepherd gathereth none other nosegays but what are the growth of our own fields, he sleepeth not under myrtle shades, but under a hedge, nor doth he vigilantly defend his flocks from wolves, because there are none, as maister Spenser well observeth:--    Well is known that since the Saxon King   Never was wolf seen, many or some,   Nor in all Kent nor in Christendom.\"  Yet a third extract from this satirical \"Proeme\" must be given, and this in connection with the language of these eclogues: \"That principally, courteous reader, whereof I would have thee to be advertised (seeing I depart from the vulgar usage) is touching the language of my shepherds; which is soothly to say, such as is neither spoken by the country maiden or the courtly dame; nay, not only such as in the present times is not uttered, but was never uttered in times past; and, if I judge aright, will never be uttered in times future. It having too much of the country to be fit for the court, too much of the court to be fit for the country; too much of the language of old times to be fit for the present, too much of the present to have been fit for the old, and too much of both to be fit for any time to come. Granted also it is, that in this my language, I seem unto myself, as a London mason, who calculateth his work for a term of years, when he buildeth with old material upon a ground-rent that is not his own, which soon turneth to rubbish and ruins. For this point, no reason can I allege, only deep learned examples having led me thereunto.\"  All this is pretty fooling; but Gay, who in the beginning intended \"The Shepherd's Week\" to be merely a burlesque, according to the suggestion of Pope, was carried away by his interest in the subject-matter, and produced a poem of undoubted value as a picture of rural life in his own day. With it he won approval as an original poet in his own day, and three centuries after critics still write in praise of it.  \"These Pastorals were originally intended, I suppose, as a burlesque on those of Philips'; but, perhaps without designing it, Gay has hit the true spirit of pastoral poetry,\" Goldsmith said; and Dr. Johnson wrote: \"The effect of reality of truth became conspicuous, even when the intention was to show them grovelling and degraded. These pastorals became popular, and were read with delight, as just representations of rural manners and occupations, by those who had no interest in the rivalry of the poets, nor knowledge of the critical disputes.\"[4] Southey, too, had a kind word to say: \"In attempting the burlesque Gay copied nature, and his unexpected success might have taught his contemporaries a better taste. Few poets seem to have possessed so quick and observing an eye\"[5]; and, coming to the present critics, Mr. Austin Dobson utters commendation: \"The object went far beyond its avowed object of ridicule, and Gay's eclogues abound with interesting folk-lore and closely studied rural pictures.\"[6]  With all his unworldliness Gay always had an eager, if not very keen, eye on the main chance, and finding himself surrounded by men of influence, he not unnaturally, in a day when men of letters often found their reward in Government places or in sinecures, looked to his acquaintances to further his interests. Great Britain was at this time represented at the Court of Hanover by a Mission which was from 1709 in charge of the Secretary, J. D'Alais, except when Special Missions were dispatched. Lord Rivers was Minister Plenipotentiary in 1710, and Thomas Harley went there as Ambassador Extraordinary in July, 1712, and again in the following February. Henry Paget, first Lord Burton, was appointed Ambassador in April, 1714, but resigned before he set forth, and Lord Clarendon was nominated in his stead.   JOHN GAY TO DEAN SWIFT.    London, June 8th, 1714.  \"Since you went out of town, my Lord Clarendon was appointed Envoy-Extraordinary to Hanover in the room of Mr. Paget, and by making use of those friends, which I entirely owe to you, he has accepted me for his Secretary. This day, by appointment, I met his Lordship at Mr. Secretary Bromley's office; he then ordered me to be ready by Saturday. I am quite off from the Duchess of Monmouth. Mr. Lewis was very ready to serve me upon this occasion, as were Dr. Arbuthnot and Mr. Ford. I am every day attending my Lord Treasurer [Oxford] for his bounty, in order to set me out, which he has promised me upon the following petition, which I sent him by Dr. Arbuthnot:--    I'm no more to converse with the swains,      But go where fine folk resort:   One can live without money on plains.      But never without it at Court.    If, when with the swains I did gambol,      I array'd me in silver and blue:   When abroad, and in Courts, I shall ramble,      Pray, my Lord, how much money will do?  We had the honour of the Treasurer's company last Saturday, when we sat upon Scriblerus. Pope is in town and has brought with him the first book of Homer. I am this evening to be at "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13790"],["title","Life And Letters Of John Gay (1685-1732), Author of \"The Beggar's Opera\" (#6)"],["body","Mr. Lewis's with [Dr. Benjamin Pratt] the Provost [of Dublin College], Mr. Ford, Parnell, and Pope.\"  \"It is thought my Lord Clarendon will make but a short stay at Hanover. If it was possible that any recommendation could be procured to make me more distinguished than ordinary, during my stay at that Court, I should think myself very happy if you could contrive any method to prosecute it, for I am told that their civilities very rarely descend so low as to the Secretary. I have all the reason in the world to acknowledge this as wholly owing to you. And the many favours I have received from you, purely out of your love for doing good, assures me you will not forget me during my absence. As for myself, whether I am at home or abroad, gratitude will always put me in mind of the man to whom I owe so many benefits.\"[7]         *       *       *       *       *  These tidings were confirmed to Swift by Arbuthnot, who wrote from St. James's on June 12th: \"You know that Gay goes to Hanover, and my Lord Treasurer has promised to equip him. Monday is the day of departure, and he is now dancing attendance for money to buy him shoes, stockings, and linen. The Duchess [of Monmouth] has turned him off, which I am afraid will make the poor man's condition worse instead of better.\"[8] As Arbuthnot reported fourteen days later, Gay received a hundred pounds from the Treasury, and \"went away a happy man.\"[9] Lord Clarendon, whose mission it was formally to offer to the Elector George Lewis the condolences of Queen Anne on the death of his aged mother, the Electress Sophia, the heiress-presumptive to the British throne, who had passed away on June 8th, 1714, arrived at Hanover on July 16th.  Despite Gay's forebodings, the civilities of the Court of Hanover did happily \"descend so low as to the Secretary.\" That he was presented to the royal circle and held converse with the highest in the land, is clear from a sentence in a letter from Arbuthnot to Swift, August 13th, 1714: \"I have a letter from Gay, just before the Queen's death. Is he not a true poet, who had not one of his own books to give to the Princess that asked for one?\"[10] Here it was that Gay first made the acquaintance of Henrietta Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk, with whom he was presently on a footing of intimate friendship.   JOHN GAY TO DR. ARBUTHNOT.    Hanover, August 16th, 1714.  \"You remember, I suppose, that I was to write you abundance of letters from Hanover; but as one of the most distinguished qualities of a publician is secrecy, you must not expect from me any arcanas of state. There is another thing that is necessary to establish the character of a politician, which is to seem always to be full of affairs of State; to know the consultations of the Cabinet Council when at the same time his politics are collected from newspapers. Which of these two causes my secrecy is owing to I leave you to determine. There is yet one thing more that is extremely necessary for a foreign minister, which he can no more be without than an artisan without his tools; I mean the terms of his art. I call it an art or a science because I think the King of France has established an academy to instruct the young Machiavelians of his country in the deep and profound science of politics. To the end I might be qualified for an employment of this nature, and not only be qualified myself, but (to speak in the style of Sir John Falstaff) be the cause of qualification in others, I have made it my business to read memoirs, treatises, etc. And as a dictionary of law-terms is thought necessary for young beginners, so I thought a dictionary of terms of State would be no less useful for young politicians. The terms of politics being not so numerous as to swell into a volume, especially in times of peace (for in times of war all the terms of fortifications are included), I thought fit to extract them in the same manner for the benefit of young practitioners as a famous author has compiled his learned treatise of the law, called the 'Doctor and Student.' I have not made any great progress in this piece; but, however, I will give you a specimen of it, which will make you in the same manner a judge of the design and nature of this treatise.  \"_Politician_: What are the necessary tools for a Prince to work with?  \"_Student_: Ministers of State.  \"_Politician_: What are the two great qualities of a Minister of State?  \"_Student_: Secrecy and despatch.  \"_Politician_: Into how many parts are the Ministers of State divided?  \"_Student_: Into two. First, Ministers of State at home; secondly, Ministers of State abroad, who are called Foreign Ministers.  \"_Politician_: Very right. Now as I design you for the latter of these employments I shall waive saying anything about the first of these. What are the different degrees of Foreign Ministers?  \"_Student_: The different degrees of Foreign Ministers are as follows: First, Plenipotentiaries; second, Ambassadors-Extraordinary; third, Ambassadors in ordinary; fourth, Envoys-Extraordinary; fifth, Envoys-in-ordinary; sixth, Residents; seventh, Consuls; and eighth, Secretaries.  \"_Politician_: How is a Foreign Minister to be known?  \"_Student_: By his credentials.  \"_Politician_: When are a Foreign Minister's credentials to be delivered?  \"_Student_: Upon his first admission into the presence of the Prince to whom he is sent, otherwise called his first audience.  \"_Politician_: How many kinds of audience are there?  \"_Student_: Two, which are called a public audience and a private audience.  \"_Politician_: What should a Foreign Minister's behaviour be when he has his first audience?  \"_Student_: He should bow profoundly, speak deliberately, and wear both sides of his long periwig before, etc.  \"By these few questions and answers you may be able to make some judgment of the usefulness of this politic treatise. Wicquefort, it is true, can never be sufficiently admired for his elaborate treatise of the conduct of an Ambassador in all his negotiations; but I design this only as a compendium, or the Ambassador's Manual, or _vade mecum._  \"I have writ so far of this letter, and do not know who to send it to; but I have now determined to send it either to Dr. Arbuthnot, the Dean of St. Patrick's, or to both. My Lord Clarendon is very much approved of at Court, and I believe is not dissatisfied with his reception. We have not very much variety of divisions; what we did yesterday and to-day we shall do to-morrow, which is to go to Court and walk in the gardens at Herrenhausen. If I write any more my letter will be just like my diversion, the same thing over and over again.\"[11]  Lord Clarendon stayed at Hanover even a shorter time than he had expected. On July 30th Lord Oxford was dismissed, and the white staff was given to the Duke of Shrewsbury, one of whose first acts was to recall the Tory Ambassador. Two days later Queen Anne died, and the Elector George Lewis succeeded to her throne under the style of George I. Lord Clarendon returned at once to England, and with him came Gay, saddened by the blasting of his hopes of advancement.  He was welcomed back by his friends, and received in particular an enthusiastic greeting from Pope, who wrote on September 23rd: \"Welcome to your native soil! Welcome to your friend! Thrice welcome to me! whether returned in glory, blessed with Court interest, the love and familiarity of the great, and filled with agreeable hopes, or melancholy with dejection, contemplative of the changes of fortune, and doubtful for the future--whether returned a triumphant Whig or a desponding Tory, equally all hail! equally beloved and welcome to me! If happy, I am to share in your elevation; if unhappy, you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at Binfield in the worst of times at your service.\" In this same letter Pope, always anxious to assist Gay, added: \"Pardon me if I add a word of advice in the practical way. Write something on the King, or Prince or Princess. On whatever foot you may be with the Court, this can do no harm.\"[12]         *       *       *       *       *  The change of Government having dashed to the ground his hopes of advancement in the diplomatic service, Gay thought that he could not do better than follow Pope's suggestion. Like the majority of men of letters of his day, and not having the independence of spirit of Swift and Pope, he hungered after a patron--a Minister might be good, but Ministers go out of office, and a member of the reigning family would be better. Remembering the kindly welcome given him at Hanover by the royal lady who was now Princess of Wales, he had indulged in a dream that a place would be offered him in her household. \"Poor Gay is much where he was, only out of the Duchess [of Monmouth]'s family and service,\" Arbuthnot wrote to Swift, October 19th, 1714. \"He has some confidence in the Princess and Countess of Picborough; I wish it may be significant to him. I advised him to make a poem upon the Princess before she came over, describing her to the English ladies; for it seems that the Princess does not dislike that. (She is really a person that I believe will give great content to everybody). But Gay was in such a grovelling condition as to the affairs of this world, that his Muse would not stoop to visit him.\"[13]  No proposal, however, being made to him, Gay, following the advice of Pope and Arbuthnot, proceeded to remind the new Court of his existence, and in November published \"A Letter to a Lady, occasioned by the arrival of Her Royal Highness \"--the \"Lady\" being, it is generally assumed, Mrs. Howard. In these verses he gave the assurance that he had desired the elements to arrange for the Princess an agreeable passage to England:--    My strains with Carolina's name I grace.   The lovely parent of our royal race.   Breathe soft, ye winds, ye waves in silence sleep;   Let prosp'rous breezes wanton o'er the deep,   Swell the white sails, and with the streamers play,   To"]]]
