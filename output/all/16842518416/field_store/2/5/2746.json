This feeling seems to have survived in a more or less vague and     unconscious form in mediæval Europe. \"In the tenth century,\"     according to Dufour (_Histoire de la Prostitution_, vol. VI., p.     11), \"shoes _a la poulaine_, with a claw or beak, pursued for     more than four centuries by the anathemas of popes and the     invectives of preachers, were always regarded by mediæval     casuists as the most abominable emblems of immodesty. At a first     glance it is not easy to see why these shoes--terminating in a     lion's claw, an eagle's beak, the prow of a ship, or other metal     appendage--should be so scandalous. The excommunication inflicted     on this kind of foot-gear preceded the impudent invention of some     libertine, who wore _poulaines_ in the shape of the phallus, a     custom adopted also by women. This kind of _poulaine_ was     denounced as _mandite de Dicu_ (Ducange's Glossary, at the word     Poulainia) and prohibited by royal ordinances (see letter of     Charles V., 17 October, 1367, regarding the garments of the women     of Montpellier). Great lords and ladies continued, however, to     wear _poulaines_.\" In Louis XL's court they were still worn of a     quarter of an ell in length.      Spain, ever tenacious of ancient ideas, appears to have preserved     longer than other countries the ancient classic traditions in     regard to the foot as a focus of modesty and an object of sexual     attraction. In Spanish religious pictures it was always necessary     that the Virgin's feet should be concealed, the clergy ordaining     that her robe should be long and flowing, so that the feet might     be covered with decent folds. Pacheco, the master and     father-in-law of Velasquez, writes in 1649 in his _Arte de la     Pintura_: \"What can be more foreign from the respect which we owe     to the purity of Our Lady the Virgin than to paint her sitting     down with one of her knees placed over the other, and often with     her sacred feet uncovered and naked. Let thanks be given to the     Holy Inquisition which commands that this liberty should be     corrected!\" It was Pacheco's duty in Seville to see that these     commands were obeyed. At the court of Philip IV. at this time the     princesses never showed their feet, as we may see in the pictures     of Velasquez. When a local manufacturer desired to present that     monarch's second bride, Mariana of Austria, with some silk     stockings the offer was indignantly rejected by the Court     Chamberlain: \"The Queen of Spain has no legs!\" Philip V.'s, queen     was thrown from her horse and dragged by the feet; no one     ventured to interfere until two gentlemen bravely rescued her and     then fled, dreading punishment by the king: they were, however,     graciously pardoned. Reinach (\"Pieds Pudiques,\" _Cultes, Mythes     et Religions_, pp. 105-110) brings together several passages from     the Countess D'Aulnoy's account of the Madrid Court in the     seventeenth century and from other sources, showing how careful     Spanish ladies were as regards their feet, and how jealous     Spanish husbands were in this matter. At this time, when Spanish     influence was considerable, the fashion of Spain seems to have     spread to other countries. One may note that in Vandyck's     pictures of English beauties the feet are not visible, though in     the more characteristically English painters of a somewhat later     age it became usual to display them conspicuously, while the     French custom in this matter is the farthest removed from the     Spanish. At the present day a well-bred Spanish woman shows as     little as possible of her feet in walking, and even in some of     the most characteristic Spanish dances there is little or no     kicking, and the feet may even be invisible throughout. It is     noteworthy that in numerous figures of Spanish women (probably     artists' models) reproduced in Ploss's _Das Weib_ the stockings     are worn, although the women are otherwise, in most cases, quite     naked. Max Dessoir mentions (\"Psychologie der Vita Sexualis,\"     _Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie_, 1894, p. 954) that in Spanish     pornographic photographs women always have their shoes on, and he     considers this an indication of perversity. I have seen the     statement (attributed to Gautier's _Voyage en Espagne_, where,     however, it does not occur) that Spanish prostitutes uncover     their feet in sign of assent, and Madame d'Aulnoy stated that in     her time to show her lover her feet was a Spanish woman's final     favor.  The tendency, which we thus find to be normal at some earlier periods of civilization, to insist on the sexual symbolism of the feminine foot or its coverings, and to regard them as a special sexual fascination, is not without significance for the interpretation of the sporadic manifestations of foot-fetichism among ourselves. Eccentric as foot-fetichism may appear to us, it is simply the re-emergence, by a pseudo-atavism or arrest of development, of a mental or emotional impulse which was probably experienced by our forefathers, and is often traceable among young children to-day.[19] The occasional reappearance of this bygone impulse and the stability which it may acquire are thus conditioned by the sensitive reaction of an abnormally nervous and usually precocious organism to influences which, among the average and ordinary population of Europe to-day, are either never felt, or quickly outgrown, or very strictly subordinated in the highly complex crystallizations which the course of love and the process of tumescence create within us.      It may be added that this is by no means true of foot-fetichism     only. In some other fetichisms a seemingly congenital     predisposition is even more marked. This is not only the case as     regards hair-fetichism and fur-fetichism (see, e.g.,     Krafft-Ebing, _Psychopathia Sexualis_, English translation of     tenth edition, pp. 233, 255, 262). In many cases of fetichisms of     all kinds not only is there no record of any commencement in a     definite episode (an absence which may be accounted for by the     supposition that the original incident has been forgotten), but     it would seem in some cases that the fetichism developed very     slowly.  In this sense, it will be seen, although it is hazardous to speak of foot-fetichism as strictly an atavism, it may certainly be said to arise on a congenital basis. It represents the rare development of an inborn germ, usually latent among ourselves, which in earlier stages of civilization frequently reached a normal and general fruition.  It is of interest to emphasize this congenital element of foot symbolism, because more than any other forms of sexual perversion the fetichisms are those which are most vaguely conditioned by inborn states of the organism and most definitely aroused by seemingly accidental associations or shocks in early life. Inversion is sometimes so fundamentally ingrained in the individual's constitution that it arises and develops in spite of the very strongest influence in a contrary direction. But a fetichism, while it tends to occur in sensitive, nervous, timid, precocious individuals--that is to say, individuals of more or less neuropathic heredity--can usually, though not always, be traced to a definite starting point in the shock of some sexually emotional episode in early life.      A few examples of the influences of such association may here be     given, referring miscellaneously to various forms of erotic     symbolism. Magnan has recorded the case of a hair-fetichist,     living in a district where the women wore their hair done up, who     at the age of 15 experienced pleasurable feelings with erection     at the sight of a village beauty combing her hair; from that time     flowing hair became his fetich, and he could not resist the     temptation to touch it and if possible sever it, thus becoming a     hair-despoiler, for which he was arrested but not sentenced.     (_Archives de l'Anthropologie Criminelle_, vol. v, No. 28.)      I have elsewhere recorded the history of a boy of 14, having     already had imperfect connection with a grown-up woman, who     associated much with a young married lady; he had no sexual     relations with her, but one day she urinated in his presence, and     he saw that her mons veneris was covered by very thick hair; from     that time he worshiped this woman in secret and acquired a     life-long fetichistic attraction to women whose pubic hair was     similarly abundant (_Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, vol. iii,     Appendix B, History V).      Roubaud reported the case of a general's son, sexually initiated     at the age of 14 by a blonde young lady of 21 who, in order to     avoid detection, always retained her clothing: gaiters, a corset     and a silk dress; when the boy's studies were completed and he     was sent to a garrison where he could enjoy freedom he found that     his sexual desires could only be aroused by blonde women dressed     like the lady who had first aroused his sexual desires;     consequently he gave up all thoughts of matrimony, as a woman in     nightclothes produced impotence (_Traité de l'Impuissance_, p.     439). Krafft-Ebing records the somewhat similar case of a nervous     Polish boy of old family seduced at the age of 17 by a French     governess, who during several months practiced mutual     masturbation with him; in this way his attention became     attracted by her very elegant boots, and in the end he became a     confirmed boot-fetichist (_Psychopathia Sexualis_, English     translation, p. 249).      A boy of 7, of bad heredity, was taught to masturbate by a     servant girl; on one occasion she practiced this on him with her     foot without taking off her shoe; it was the first time the     manoeuvre gave him any pleasure, and an association was thus"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#8)"],["body","which led to shoe-fetichism (Hammond, _Sexual     Impotence_, p. 44). A government official whose first coitus in     youth took place on a staircase; the sound of his partner's     creaking shoes against the stairs, produced by her efforts to     accelerate orgasm, formed an association which developed into an     auditory shoe-fetichism; in the streets he was compelled to     follow ladies whose shoes creaked, ejaculation being thus     produced, while to obtain complete satisfaction he would make a     prostitute, otherwise naked, sit in front of him in her shoes,     moving her feet so that the shoes creaked. (Moraglia, _Archivio     di Psichiatria_, vol. xiii, p. 568.)      Bechterew, in St. Petersburg, has recorded the case of a man who     when a child used to fall asleep at the knees of his nurse with     his head buried in the folds of her apron; in this position he     first experienced erection and voluptuous sensations; when a     youth he had no attraction to naked women, and in real life and     in dreams was only excited sexually under conditions recalling     his early experience; in his relations with women he preferred     them dressed, and was excited by the rustling sound of their     skirts; in this case there was no traceable neuropathic taint nor     any other personal peculiarity. (Summarized in _Journal de     Psychologie Normale et Pathologique_, January-February, 1904, p.     72.)      In a curious case recorded in detail by Moll, a philologist of     sensitive temperament but sound heredity, who had always been     fond of flowers, at the age of 21 became engaged to a young lady     who wore large roses fastened in her jacket; from this time roses     became to him a sexual fetich, to kiss them caused erection, and     his erotic dreams were accompanied by visions of roses and the     hallucination of their odor; the engagement was finally broken     off and the rose-fetichism disappeared (_Untersuchungen über     Libido Sexualis_, bd. i, p. 540).  Such associations may naturally occur in the early experiences of even the most normal persons. The degree to which they will influence the subsequent life and thought and feeling depends on the degree of the individual's morbid emotional receptivity, on the extent to which he is hereditarily susceptible of abnormal deviation. Precocity is undoubtedly a condition which favors such deviation; a child who is precociously and abnormally sensitive to persons of the opposite sex before puberty has established the normal channels of sexual desire, is peculiarly liable to become the prey of a chance symbolism. All degrees of such symbolism are possible. While the average insensitive person may fail to perceive them at all, for the more alert and imaginative lover they are a fascinating part of the highly charged crystallization of passion. A more nervously exceptional person, when once such a symbolism has become firmly implanted, may find it an absolutely essential element in the charm of a beloved and charming person. Finally, for the individual who is thoroughly unsound the symbol becomes generalized; a person is no longer desired at all, being merely regarded as an appendage of the symbol, or being dispensed with altogether; the symbol is alone desired, and is fully adequate to impart by itself complete sexual gratification. While it must be considered a morbid state to demand a symbol as an almost essential part of the charm of a desired person, it is only in the final condition, in which the symbol becomes all-sufficing, that we have a true and complete perversion. In the less complete forms of symbolism it is still the woman who is desired, and the ends of procreation may be served; when the woman is ignored and the mere symbol is an adequate and even preferred stimulus to detumescence the pathological condition becomes complete.  Krafft-Ebing regarded shoe-fetichism as, in large measure, a more or less latent form of masochism, the foot or the shoe being the symbol of the subjection and humiliation which the masochist feels in the presence of the beloved object. Moll is also inclined to accept such a connection.      \"The very numerous class of boot-and-shoe-fetichists,\"     Krafft-Ebing wrote, \"forms the transition to the manifestations     of another independent perversion, i.e., fetichism itself; but it     stands in closer relationship to the former.... It is highly     probable, and shown by a correct classification of the observed     cases, that the majority, and perhaps all of the cases of     shoe-fetichism, rest upon a basis of more or less conscious     masochistic desire for self-humiliation.... The majority or all     may be looked upon as instances of latent masochism (the motive     remaining unconscious) in which the _female foot or shoe, as the     masochist's fetich_, has acquired an independent significance.\"     (_Psychopathia Sexualis_, English translation of tenth edition,     pp. 159, et seq.) \"Though Krafft-Ebing may not have cleared up     the whole matter,\" Moll remarks, \"I regard his deductions     concerning the connection of foot-and-shoe fetichism to masochism     as the most important progress that has been made in the     theoretic study of sexual perversions.... In any case, the     connection is very frequent.\" (_Konträre Sexualempfindung_, third     edition, p. 306.)  It is quite easy to see that this supposed identity of masochism and foot-fetichism forms a seductive theory. It is also undoubtedly true that a masochist may very easily be inclined to find in his mistress's foot an aid to the ecstatic self-abnegation which he desires to attain.[20] But only confusion is attained by any general attempt to amalgamate masochism and foot-fetichism. In the broad sense in which erotic symbolism is here understood, both masochism and foot-fetichism may be coördinated as symbolisms; for the masochist his self-humiliating impulses are the symbol of ecstatic adoration; for the foot-fetichist his mistress's foot or shoe is the concentrated symbol of all that is most beautiful and elegant and feminine in her personality. But if in this sense they are coördinated, they remain entirely distinct and have not even any necessary tendency to become merged. Masochism merely simulates foot-fetichism; for the masochist the boot is not strictly a symbol, it is only an instrument which enables him to carry out his impulse; the true sexual symbol for him is not the boot, but the emotion of self-subjection. For the foot-fetichist, on the other hand, the foot or the shoe is not a mere instrument, but a true symbol; the focus of his worship, an idealized object which he is content to contemplate or reverently touch. He has no necessary impulse to any self-degrading action, nor any constant emotion of subjection. It may be noted that in the very typical case of foot-fetichism which is presented to us in the person of Restif de la Bretonne (_ante_, p. 18), he repeatedly speaks of \"subjecting\" the woman for whom he feels this fetichistic adoration, and mentions that even when still a child he especially admired a delicate and fairy-like girl in this respect because she seemed to him easier to subjugate. Throughout life Restif's attitude toward women was active and masculine, without the slightest trace of masochism.[21]  To suppose that a fetichistic admiration of his mistress's foot is due to a lover's latent desire to be kicked, is as unreasonable as it would be to suppose that a fetichistic admiration for her hand indicated a latent desire to have his ears boxed. In determining whether we are concerned with a case of foot-fetichism or of masochism we must take into consideration the whole of the subject's mental and emotional attitude. An act, however definite, will not suffice as a criterion, for the same act in different persons may have altogether different implications. To amalgamate the two is the result of inadequate psychological analysis and only leads to confusion.  It is, however, often very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with a case which is predominantly one of masochism or of foot-fetichism. The nature of the action desired, as we have seen, will not suffice to determine the psychological character of the perversion. Krafft-Ebing believed that the desire to be trodden on, very frequently experienced by masochists, is absolutely symptomatic of masochism.[22] This is scarcely the case. The desire to be trodden on may be fundamentally an erotic symbolism, closely approaching foot-fetichism, and such slight indications of masochism as appear may be merely a parasitic growth on the symbolism, a growth perhaps more suggested by the circumstances involved in the gratification of the abnormal desire than inherent in the innate impulse of the subject. This may be illustrated by the interesting case of a very intelligent man with whom I am well acquainted.      C.P., aged 38. Heredity good. Parents both healthy and normal.     Several children of the marriage, all sexually normal so far as     is known. C.P. is the youngest of the family and separated from     the others by an interval of many years. He was a seven-months'     child. He has always enjoyed good health and is active and     vigorous, both mentally and physically.      From the age of 9 or 10 to 14 he masturbated occasionally for the     sake of physical relief, having discovered the act for himself.     He was, however, quite innocent and knew nothing of sexual     matters, never having been initiated either by servants or by     other boys.      \"When I encounter a woman who very strongly attracts me and whom     I very greatly admire,\" he writes, \"my desire is never that I may     have sexual connection with her in the ordinary sense, but that I     may lie down upon the floor on my back and be trampled upon by     her. This curious desire is seldom present unless the object of     my admiration is really a lady, and of fine proportions. She "]]]
