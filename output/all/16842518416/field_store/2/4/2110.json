We intended to fish in the valley back of us. It used to be a fine place for trout. But it's been burned over and there are no trout left.\"  \"I know,\" said the man. \"I've seen it. Be careful with your fires, boys. We don't want any more of this fine timber burned.\"  \"Are you a forest-ranger, too?\" asked Charley eagerly.  \"No; I'm the forester. I have charge of this forest.\"  \"Why, I thought you were at headquarters with your fire crew,\" cried Charley, hardly realizing what he was saying.  The man looked at him sharply. \"I ought to be and I wish I were,\" he said. \"I don't like this a bit. But I was ordered by the Commissioner to send in an immediate estimate on the amount of timber in this stand. There's a big sale on and they have to know how much there is to sell.\" He paused and then added: \"How in the world did you know I was supposed to be at headquarters with the fire crew?\"  \"A ranger told us so. We met him over in the other valley. He said he wished he was with you.\"  \"Oh! That would be Morton,\" said the forester. \"I sent him out on patrol because we were short of fire patrols.\"  \"Could you use me as a fire patrol?\" said Charley quickly.  The forester looked at him searchingly. \"Why do you want to be a fire patrol?\" he asked.  \"I've got to go to work at something,\" said Charley, \"and I'd love to help care for the forest. You see, I'm almost through high school and I've got to go to work and help Dad the minute I've graduated. He wants me to go into the factory with him. I hate factories. But I love the woods. You'd never be sorry, if you hired me, sir.\"  \"Are you sure it isn't work rather than the factory you dislike?\" demanded the forester bluntly.  \"No, no!\" protested Charley. \"I'd work day and night gladly if I could do what I want to do. And there's nothing I can think of I'd rather do than help take care of the forest.\"  \"Very good,\" said the forester, \"but I need patrols now, not after school closes in June.\"  \"Maybe I could get excused for the rest of the term,\" pleaded Charley.  \"And throw away your chance to graduate? I don't think I want that kind of a boy for a fire patrol,\" said the forester with a frown. \"You might decide to quit this job, too, about the time we stacked up against a hot fire.\"  Lew spoke up. \"You don't understand what Charley means, sir,\" he explained. \"Charley is away ahead of most of us in his school work. He's done enough now to give him his diploma.\"  \"Indeed!\" replied the forester.  Then he turned to Charley in apology. \"I beg your pardon, young man. I misjudged you. I should like to have such an exemplary young man for a patrol, but you are too young. We practically never employ a man not yet of age as a fire patrol. A boy would have to have very unusual qualifications if we did take him. I'm sorry, my lad. I believe you are a fine boy, and I'd like to hire you. But you are too young.\"  Charley turned his head away to hide the tears that he could not keep back as he saw the opportunity slipping away from him. Then he dashed his hand across his eyes and again faced the forester.  \"You do not understand who we are,\" he said with determination, \"nor what our qualifications are. I am accustomed to the woods, sir. I know something of woodcraft. I have fought fire in the forest. I have spent weeks in the mountains. And I am a wireless operator, sir. Are any of your patrols better qualified?\"  The forester looked at him with renewed interest. \"As a patrol,\" he remarked, \"you would have to deal with grown men. You would find yourself in many situations that you could not handle. Grown men do not like to take orders from boys.\"  \"I have handled men, sir; that is, I have helped to handle them. I helped to capture the German dynamiters at Elk City, sir, when the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol saved that place from destruction.\"  \"Are you a member of that organization?\" asked the forester with increasing interest. \"I remember reading about that.\"  \"We both are,\" said Charley. \"And I could help you so much with my wireless, sir. Your ranger told us this morning that if he found a fire he couldn't handle, he would have to go clear out to the highway before he could summon help. With the wireless, help could be summoned almost instantly.\"  The forester smiled indulgently. \"It sounds good,\" he commented. \"But you forget that we have no wireless and that none of us knows anything about radio-telegraphy. No; I am afraid I can't use you, though I'd like to. If you still want a job when you are of age, come to me. I can use you as a patrol and I might even have a place for you as a ranger. We have mighty few rangers as well educated and equipped as you will be. Or you might even decide to go to Mont Alto and take a degree in forestry and become a forester like myself. I would like to see you in the service, but I can't take you in now. I must get on with my work and hurry back to my office. Good-bye and good luck to you. And don't forget about your fires.\"  Turning to the elder of his two companions, he said, \"All right, Finnegan. Go ahead.\"  The man stepped to the nearest tree, slipped his calipers on it breast-high, then glanced aloft. \"White pine, forty-three, five,\" he called.  The forester put down the figures in his cruising book.  \"Hemlock, twenty-eight, four,\" called the other man.  The men were experienced timber cruisers. They were measuring the amount of wood in the forest. The first man meant that the white pine tree he was measuring was forty-three inches in diameter breast-high and would make five standard logs, each sixteen feet long. The second scaler had measured a hemlock twenty-eight inches in diameter and long enough for four logs. They were measuring the timber on a few acres, so as to form an estimate of the amount for sale.  The work interested Lew greatly, but Charley had no heart for anything. He had fought hard and apparently his last chance had slipped away from him.  He was very quiet as they made their way through the valley. Even the run in the bottom failed to stir him, though he loved the little mountain streams passionately. Yet he did notice that here, beneath the lofty pines, where the forest mold lay deep and spongy, the brook flowed strongly. It sang as it rushed along between its rugged banks. But there was no music in its song for Charley. So alluring was the stream that Lew wanted to fish, but Charley had no heart even to try for a trout; though it was practically a certainty that there were trout aplenty to be had. Time heals all wounds. It would heal Charley's: but not enough time had yet elapsed for the healing process to begin. At present he could think of nothing but his dismal prospects.  So they went on through the bottom and slowly ascended the opposite mountain. As they had suspected might be the case, it was impossible to distinguish the landmarks they had chosen. The innumerable great trunks of the pines cut off their vision as effectually as a high board fence could have done. But the slope of the land told them which way to go, and the freedom from underbrush made it possible for them to travel in a comparatively straight line. So they reached the crest of the mountain, after a stiff climb, not far from the spot which they had selected.  The summit was sparsely timbered and they had no difficulty either in finding their landmarks or in mapping out their way down the farther slope and across the valley to the gap beyond. This second valley was also well timbered. In the middle of this second valley another fine brook flowed. And here they rested and had a bite to eat, with a cold drink from the stream. Then they filled the canteen again and pressed on. The afternoon was well advanced before they had climbed through the pass and reached the valley that was to be their home for the next few days.  Like the valley in which they had met the forester, this bottom contained some wonderful pines, though it was really a mixed stand of timber with hardwoods beneath and the pine tops rising high above them. There were countless numbers of these mammoth pines that towered a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five feet in air. The hardwoods, though shut out from some of the light, were also wonderful for size and vigor. It was a splendid example of a \"two-storied-forest.\" The resulting shade was so dense that it was like twilight at the ground level. And the stream that went rushing among the trees was a joy to behold. Deep, dark, crystal clear, and almost as cold as ice, it was an ideal haunt for trout.  By the time they reached it, Charley had recovered his spirits. \"Oh boy!\" he cried, when they reached the margin of the run. \"Look at this brook.\" As he stopped and dipped his hand in the water, he added, \"It's cold enough to freeze a fellow. Thank goodness, there isn't any underbrush here. We won't have to wade. I'll wager this place is full of fish.\"  Hardly had he spoken before a great trout darted across the stream, almost at their feet. Charley extended his rod over the water and waved it vigorously a few times. Instantly trout darted out from a dozen different points.  \"Gee whiz!\" shouted Charley. \"Did you see 'em, Lew? I can hardly wait to get a line in.\"  \"We've got to get our camp made before we do any fishing,\" replied Lew. \"Let's hustle up and find a good camp site.\"  They walked rapidly up the valley, keeping a few yards back from the brook so as not to alarm the trout.  \"I don't know how our wireless will work among all these trees,\" said Lew. \"If we could find an open spot I'm sure it would be better.\"  Presently they came to exactly the sort of place they desired. At some time, evidently within a few months, for no brush had as yet sprung up, a hurricane had swept through the forest: and where it had passed lay a windrow of trees as flat as a swath of grain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12841"],["title","John Marr and Other Poems (#0)"],["body","Marr and Other Poems  By Herman Melville  _With An Introductory Note By_ HENRY CHAPIN  MCMXXII     CONTENTS   INTRODUCTORY NOTE   JOHN MARR AND OTHER SAILORS  JOHN MARR AND OTHER SAILORS  BRIDEGROOM DICK  TOM DEADLIGHT  JACK ROY   SEA PIECES  THE HAGLETS  THE AEOLIAN HARP  TO THE MASTER OF THE _METEOR_  FAR OFF-SHORE  THE MAN-OF-WAR HAWK  THE FIGURE-HEAD  THE GOOD CRAFT _SNOW BIRD_  OLD COUNSEL  THE TUFT OF KELP  THE MALDIVE SHARK  TO NED  CROSSING THE TROPICS  THE BERG  THE ENVIABLE ISLES  PEBBLES   POEMS FROM TIMOLEON  LINES TRACED UNDER AN IMAGE OF AMOR THREATENING  THE NIGHT MARCH  THE RAVAGED VILLA  THE NEW ZEALOT TO THE SUN  MONODY  LONE FOUNTS  THE BENCH OF BOORS  ART  THE ENTHUSIAST  SHELLEY’S VISION  THE MARCHIONESS OF BRINVILLIERS  THE AGE OF THE ANTONINES  HERBA SANTA  OFF CAPE COLONNA  THE APPARITION  L’ENVOI  SUPPLEMENT   POEMS FROM BATTLE PIECES  THE PORTENT  FROM THE CONFLICT OF CONVICTIONS  THE MARCH INTO VIRGINIA  BALL’S BLUFF  THE STONE FLEET  THE TEMERAIRE  A UTILITARIAN VIEW OF THE _MONITOR’S_ FIGHT  MALVERN HILL  STONEWALL JACKSON  THE HOUSE-TOP  CHATTANOOGA  ON THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A CORPS COMMANDER  THE SWAMP ANGEL  SHERIDAN AT CEDAR CREEK  IN THE PRISON PEN  THE COLLEGE COLONEL  THE MARTYR  REBEL COLOR-BEARERS AT SHILOH  AURORA BOREALIS  THE RELEASED REBEL PRISONER  “FORMERLY A SLAVE”  ON THE SLAIN COLLEGIANS  AMERICA  INSCRIPTION  THE FORTITUDE OF THE NORTH  THE MOUND BY THE LAKE  ON THE SLAIN AT CHICKAMAUGA  AN UNINSCRIBED MONUMENT  ON THE GRAVE OF A YOUNG CAVALRY OFFICER KILLED IN THE VALLEY OF VIRGINIA  A REQUIEM  COMMEMORATIVE OF A NAVAL VICTORY  A MEDITATION   POEMS FROM MARDI  WE FISH  INVOCATION  DIRGE  MARLENA  PIPE SONG  SONG OF YOOMY  GOLD  THE LAND OF LOVE   POEMS FROM CLAREL  DIRGE  EPILOGUE     INTRODUCTORY NOTE   Melville’s verse printed for the most part privately in small editions from middle life onward after his great prose work had been written, taken as a whole, is of an amateurish and uneven quality. In it, however, that loveable freshness of personality, which his philosophical dejection never quenched, is everywhere in evidence. It is clear that he did not set himself to master the poet’s art, yet through the mask of conventional verse which often falls into doggerel, the voice of a true poet is heard. In selecting the pieces for this volume I have put in the vigorous sea verses of _John Marr_ in their entirety and added those others from his _Battle Pieces_, _Timoleon,_ etc., that best indicate the quality of their author’s personality. The prose supplement to battle pieces has been included because it does so much to explain the feeling of his war verse and further because it is such a remarkably wise and clear commentary upon those confused and troublous days of post-war reconstruction. H. C.     JOHN MARR AND OTHER SAILORS     JOHN MARR AND OTHER SAILORS   Since as in night’s deck-watch ye show, Why, lads, so silent here to me, Your watchmate of times long ago? Once, for all the darkling sea, You your voices raised how clearly, Striking in when tempest sung; Hoisting up the storm-sail cheerly, _Life is storm—let storm!_ you rung. Taking things as fated merely, Childlike though the world ye spanned; Nor holding unto life too dearly, Ye who held your lives in hand— Skimmers, who on oceans four Petrels were, and larks ashore.  O, not from memory lightly flung, Forgot, like strains no more availing, The heart to music haughtier strung; Nay, frequent near me, never staleing, Whose good feeling kept ye young. Like tides that enter creek or stream, Ye come, ye visit me, or seem Swimming out from seas of faces, Alien myriads memory traces, To enfold me in a dream!  I yearn as ye. But rafts that strain, Parted, shall they lock again? Twined we were, entwined, then riven, Ever to new embracements driven, Shifting gulf-weed of the main! And how if one here shift no more, Lodged by the flinging surge ashore? Nor less, as now, in eve’s decline, Your shadowy fellowship is mine. Ye float around me, form and feature:— Tattooings, ear-rings, love-locks curled; Barbarians of man’s simpler nature, Unworldly servers of the world. Yea, present all, and dear to me, Though shades, or scouring China’s sea.  Whither, whither, merchant-sailors, Whitherward now in roaring gales? Competing still, ye huntsman-whalers, In leviathan’s wake what boat prevails? And man-of-war’s men, whereaway? If now no dinned drum beat to quarters On the wilds of midnight waters— Foemen looming through the spray; Do yet your gangway lanterns, streaming, Vainly strive to pierce below, When, tilted from the slant plank gleaming, A brother you see to darkness go?  But, gunmates lashed in shotted canvas, If where long watch-below ye keep, Never the shrill _“All hands up hammocks!”_ Breaks the spell that charms your sleep, And summoning trumps might vainly call, And booming guns implore— A beat, a heart-beat musters all, One heart-beat at heart-core. It musters. But to clasp, retain; To see you at the halyards main— To hear your chorus once again!     BRIDEGROOM DICK   1876   Sunning ourselves in October on a day Balmy as spring, though the year was in decay, I lading my pipe, she stirring her tea, My old woman she says to me, “Feel ye, old man, how the season mellows?” And why should I not, blessed heart alive, Here mellowing myself, past sixty-five, To think o’ the May-time o’ pennoned young fellows This stripped old hulk here for years may survive.  Ere yet, long ago, we were spliced, Bonny Blue, (Silvery it gleams down the moon-glade o’ time, Ah, sugar in the bowl and berries in the prime!) Coxswain I o’ the Commodore’s crew,— Under me the fellows that manned his fine gig, Spinning him ashore, a king in full fig. Chirrupy even when crosses rubbed me, Bridegroom Dick lieutenants dubbed me. Pleasant at a yarn, Bob o’ Linkum in a song, Diligent in duty and nattily arrayed, Favored I was, wife, and _fleeted_ right along; And though but a tot for such a tall grade, A high quartermaster at last I was made.  All this, old lassie, you have heard before, But you listen again for the sake e’en o’ me; No babble stales o’ the good times o’ yore To Joan, if Darby the babbler be.  Babbler?—O’ what? Addled brains, they forget! O—quartermaster I; yes, the signals set, Hoisted the ensign, mended it when frayed, Polished up the binnacle, minded the helm, And prompt every order blithely obeyed. To me would the officers say a word cheery— Break through the starch o’ the quarter-deck realm; His coxswain late, so the Commodore’s pet. Ay, and in night-watches long and weary, Bored nigh to death with the navy etiquette, Yearning, too, for fun, some younker, a cadet, Dropping for time each vain bumptious trick, Boy-like would unbend to Bridegroom Dick. But a limit there was—a check, d’ ye see: Those fine young aristocrats knew their degree.  Well, stationed aft where their lordships keep,— Seldom _going_ forward excepting to sleep,— I, boozing now on by-gone years, My betters recall along with my peers. Recall them? Wife, but I see them plain: Alive, alert, every man stirs again. Ay, and again on the lee-side pacing, My spy-glass carrying, a truncheon in show, Turning at the taffrail, my footsteps retracing, Proud in my duty, again methinks I go. And Dave, Dainty Dave, I mark where he stands, Our trim sailing-master, to time the high-noon, That thingumbob sextant perplexing eyes and hands, Squinting at the sun, or twigging o’ the moon; Then, touching his cap to Old Chock-a-Block Commanding the quarter-deck,—“Sir, twelve o’clock.”  Where sails he now, that trim sailing-master, Slender, yes, as the ship’s sky-s’l pole? Dimly I mind me of some sad disaster— Dainty Dave was dropped from the navy-roll! And ah, for old Lieutenant Chock-a-Block— Fast, wife, chock-fast to death’s black dock! Buffeted about the obstreperous ocean, Fleeted his life, if lagged his promotion. Little girl, they are all, all gone, I think, Leaving Bridegroom Dick here with lids that wink.  Where is Ap Catesby? The fights fought of yore Famed him, and laced him with epaulets, and more. But fame is a wake that after-wakes cross, And the waters wallow all, and laugh           _Where’s the loss?_ But John Bull’s bullet in his shoulder bearing Ballasted Ap in his long sea-faring. The middies they ducked to the man who had messed With Decatur in the gun-room, or forward pressed Fighting beside Perry, Hull, Porter, and the rest.  Humped veteran o’ the Heart-o’-Oak war, Moored long in haven where the old heroes are, Never on _you_ did the iron-clads jar! Your open deck when the boarder assailed, The frank old heroic hand-to-hand then availed.  But where’s Guert Gan? Still heads he the van? As before Vera-Cruz, when he dashed splashing through The blue rollers sunned, in his brave gold-and-blue, And, ere his cutter in keel took the strand, Aloft waved his sword on the hostile land! Went up the cheering, the quick chanticleering; All hands vying—all colors flying: “Cock-a-doodle-doo!” and “Row, boys, row!” “Hey, Starry Banner!” “Hi, Santa Anna!” Old Scott’s young dash at Mexico.  Fine forces o’ the land, fine forces o’ the sea, Fleet, army, and flotilla—tell, heart o’ me, Tell, if you can, whereaway now they be!  But ah, how to speak of the hurricane unchained— The Union’s strands parted in the hawser over-strained; Our flag blown to shreds, anchors gone altogether— The dashed fleet o’ States in Secession’s foul weather.  Lost in the smother o’ that wide public stress, In hearts, private hearts, what ties there were snapped! Tell, Hal—vouch, Will, o’ the ward-room mess, On you how the riving thunder-bolt clapped. With a bead in your eye and beads in your glass, And a grip o’ the flipper, it was part and pass: “Hal, must it be: Well, if come indeed the shock, To North or to South, let the victory cleave, Vaunt it he may on his dung-hill the cock, But _Uncle Sam’s_ eagle never crow will, believe.”  Sentiment: ay, while suspended hung all, Ere the guns against Sumter"]]]
