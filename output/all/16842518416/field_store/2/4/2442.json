The God who speaks to him saw the difficulties long ago and eagerly longed to remove them. Now they have come to agreement. And through this willing will God eagerly works out His purpose.    <u>A Very Old Question.</u>   This leads to a very old question: Does prayer influence God? No question has been discussed more, or more earnestly. Skeptical men of fine scientific training have with great positiveness said \"no.\" And Christian men of scholarly training and strong faith have with equal positiveness said \"yes.\" Strange to say both have been right. Not right in all their statements, nor right in all their beliefs, nor right in all their processes of thinking, but right in their ultimate conclusions as represented by these short words, \"no,\" and \"yes.\" Prayer does not influence God. Prayer surely does influence God. It does not influence His purpose. It does influence His action. Everything that ever has been prayed for, of course I mean every right thing, God has already purposed to do. But He does nothing without our consent. He has been hindered in His purposes by our lack of willingness. When we learn His purposes and make them our prayers we are giving Him the opportunity to act. It is a double opportunity: manward and Satanward. We are willing. Our willingness checkmates Satan's opposition. It opens the path to God and rids it of the obstacles. And so the road is cleared for the free action already planned.  The further question of nature's laws being sometimes set aside is wholly a secondary matter. Nature's laws are merely God's habit of action in handling secondary forces. They involve no purpose of God. His purposes are regarding moral issues. That the sun shall stay a bit longer than usual over a certain part of the earth is a mere detail with God. It does not affect His power for the whole affair is under His finger. It does not affect His purpose for that as concerning far more serious matters. The emergencies of earth wrought by sin necessitate just such incidents, that the great purpose of God for man shall be accomplished.  Emergencies change all habits of action, divine and human. They are the real test of power. If a man throw down the bundle he is carrying and make a quick wild dash out into the middle of the street, dropping his hat on the way, and grasp convulsively for something on the ground when no cause appears for such action we would quickly conclude that the proper place for him is an asylum. But if a little toddling child is almost under the horse's hoofs, or the trolley car, no one thinks of criticising, but instead admires his courage, and quick action, and breathlessly watches for the result. Emergencies call for special action. They should control actions, where they exist. Emergencies explain action, and explain satisfactorily what nothing else could explain.  _The world is in a great emergency through sin._ Only as that tremendous fact grips us shall we be men of prayer, and men of action up to the limit of the need, and to the limit of the possibilities. Only as that intense fact is kept in mind shall we begin to understand God's actions in history, and in our personal experiences. The greatest event of earth, the cross, was an emergency action.  The fact that prayer does not make any change in God's thought or purpose, reveals His marvellous love in a very tender way.  Suppose I want something very much and _need_ as well as want. And I go to God and ask for it. And suppose He is reluctant about giving: had not thought about giving me that thing; and rather hesitates. But I am insistent, and plead and persist and by and by God is impressed with my earnestness, and sees that I really need the thing, and answers my prayer, and gives me what I ask. Is not that a loving God so to listen and yield to my plea? Surely. How many times just such an instance has taken place between a child and his father, or mother. And the child thinks to himself, \"How loving father is; he has given me the thing I asked for.\"  But suppose God is thinking about me all the time, and planning, with love-plans for me, and longing to give me much that He has. Yet in His wisdom He does not give because I do not know my own need, and have not opened my hand to receive, yes, and, further yet, likely as not, not knowing my need I might abuse, or misuse, or fail to use, something given before I had felt the need of it. And now I come to see and feel that need and come and ask and He, delighted with the change in me, eagerly gives. Tell me, is not that a very much more loving God than the other conception suggests? The truth is _that_ is God. Jesus says, \"Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of _before ye ask_.\" And He is a Father. And with God the word father means mother too. Then what He _knows_ we need He has _already planned_ to give. The great question for me then in praying for some personal thing is this: Do _I_ know what _He_ knows I need? Am I thinking about what He is thinking about for me?  And then remember that God is so much more in His loving planning than the wisest, most loving father we know. Does a mother think into her child's needs, the food, and clothing and the extras too, the luxuries? That is God, only He is more loving and wiser than the best of us. I have sometimes thought this: that if God were to say to me: \"I want to give you something as a special love-gift; an extra because I love you: what would you like to have?\" Do you know I have thought I would say, \"Dear God, _you_ choose. _I_ choose what _you_ choose.\" He is thinking about me. He knows what I am thinking of, and what I would most enjoy, and He is such a lover-God that He would choose something Just a bit finer than I would think. I might be thinking of a dollar, but likely as not He is thinking of a double eagle. I am thinking of blackberries, big, juicy blackberries, but really I do not know what blackberries are beside the sort He knows and would choose for me. That is our God. Prayer does not and cannot change the purpose of such a God. For every right and good thing we might ask for He has already planned to give us. But prayer does change the action of God. Because He cannot give against our wills, and our willingness as expressed by our asking gives Him the opportunity to do as He has already planned.    <u>The Greatest Prayer.</u>   There is a greatest prayer, _the_ greatest that can be offered. It is the substratum of every true prayer. It is the undercurrent in the stream of all Spirit-breathed prayer. Jesus Himself gives it to us in the only form of prayer He left for our use. It is small in size, but mighty in power. Four words--\"Thy will be done.\" Let us draw up our chairs, and _brew_ it over mentally, that its strength and fragrance may come up into our nostrils, and fill our very beings.  \"_Thy_\": That is God. On one side, He is wise, with all of the intellectual strength, and keenness and poised judgment that that word among men brings to us. On another side, He is strong, with all that that word can imply of might and power irresistible. On still another side He is good, pure, holy with the finest thought those words ever suggest to us in those whom we know best, or in our dreams and visions. Then on a side remaining, the tender personal side, He is--loving? No, that is quite inadequate. He is _love_. Its personification is He. Now remember that we do not know the meaning of those words. Our best definition and thought of them, even in our dreams, when we let ourselves out, but hang around the outskirts. The heart of them we do not know. Those words mean infinitely more than we think. Their meaning is a projection along the lines of our thought of them, but measurelessly beyond our highest reach.  And then, this God, wise, strong, good, and love, _is kin to us_. We belong to Him.      \"We are His flock;     He doth us feed.     And for His sheep,     He doth us take.\"  We are His children by creation, and by a new creation in Jesus Christ. He is ours, by His own act. That is the \"Thy\"--a God wise, strong, pure, who is love, and who is a Father-mother-God, and is _our_ God.  \"Thy _will_.\" God's will is His desires, His purposes, that which He wishes to occur, and that to which He gives His strength that it may occur. The earth is His creation. Men are His children. Judging from wise loving parents among men He has given Himself to thinking and studying and planning for all men, and every man, and for the earth. His plan is the most wise, pure, loving plan that can be thought of, _and more._ It takes in the whole sweep of our lives, and every detail of them. Nothing escapes the love-vigilance of our God. What _can_ be so vigilant and keen as love? Hate, the exact reverse, comes the nearest. It is ever the extremes that meet. But hate cannot come up to love for keen watchfulness at every turn. Health, strength, home, loved ones, friendships, money, guidance, protecting care, the necessities, the extras that love ever thinks of, service--all these are included in God's loving thought for us. That is His will. It is modified by the degree of our consent, and further modified by the circumstances of our lives. Life has become a badly tangled skein of threads. God with infinite patience and skill is at work untangling and bringing the best possible out of the tangle. What is absolutely best is rarely relatively best. That which is best in itself is usually not best under certain circumstances, with human lives in the balance. God has fathomless skill, and measureless patience, and a love utterly beyond both. He is ever working out the best thing possible under every circumstance. He could oftentimes do more, and do it in much less time if our human wills were more pliant to His. He can be trusted. And of course _trust_ means _trust in the darkest dark_ where you cannot see. And trust means trust. It does not mean test. Where you trust"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13196"],["title","Quiet Talks on Prayer (#7)"],["body","do not test. Where you test you do not trust. Making this our prayer means trusting God. That is God, and that His will, and that the meaning of our offering this prayer. \"Thy will _be_.\" A man's will is the man in action, within the limits of his power. God's will for man is Himself in action, within the limits of our cooperation. _Be_ is a verb, an action-word, in the passive voice. It takes some form of the verb to be to express the passive voice of any action-word. It takes the intensest activity of will to put this passive voice into human action. The greatest strength is revealed in intelligent yielding. Here the prayer is expressing the utter willingness of a man that God's will shall be done in him, and through him. A man never _loses_ his will, unless indeed he lose his manhood. But here he makes that will as strong as it can be made, as a bit of steel, better like the strong oak, strong enough to sway and bend in the wind. Then he uses all its strength in becoming passive to a higher will. And that too when the purpose of that higher will is not clear to his own limited knowledge and understanding.  \"Thy will be _done_.\" That is, be accomplished, be brought to pass. The word stands for the action in its perfected, finished state. Thy will be fully accomplished in its whole sweep and in all its items. It speaks not only the earnest desire of the heart praying, but the set purpose that everything in the life is held subject to the doing of this purpose of God. It means that surrender of purpose that has utterly changed the lives of the strongest men in order that the purpose of God might be dominant. It cut off from a great throne earth's greatest jurist, the Hebrew lawgiver, and led him instead to be allied to a race of slaves. It led that intellectual giant Jeremiah from an easy enjoyable leadership to espouse a despised cause and so be himself despised. It led Paul from the leadership of his generation in a great nation to untold suffering, and to a block and an ax. It led Jesus the very Son of God, away from a kingship to a cross. In every generation it has radically changed lives, and life-ambitions. \"Thy will be done\" is the great dominant purpose-prayer that has been the pathway of God in all His great doings among men.  That will is being done everywhere else in God's great world of worlds, save on the earth and that portion of the spirit world allied to this earth. Everywhere else there is the perfect music of harmony with God's will. Here only is heard the harsh discordant note.  With this prayer go two clauses that really particularize and explain it. They are included in it, and are added to make more clear the full intent. The first of these clauses gives the sweep of His will in its broadest outlines. The second touches the opposition to that will both for our individual lives and for the race and the earth.  The first clause is this, \"Thy kingdom come.\" In both of these short sentences, \"Thy will be done,\" \"Thy kingdom come,\" the emphatic word is \"Thy.\" That word is set in sharpest possible contrast here. There is another kingdom now on the earth. There is another will being done. This other kingdom must go if God's kingdom is to come. These kingdoms are antagonistic at every point of contact. They are rivals for the same allegiance and the same territory. They cannot exist together. Charles II and Cromwell cannot remain in London together. \"Thy kingdom come,\" of necessity includes this, \"the other kingdom go.\" \"Thy kingdom come\" means likewise \"Thy king come,\" for in the nature of things there cannot be a kingdom without a king. That means again by the same inference, \"the other prince go,\" the one who makes pretensions to being rightful heir to the throne. \"Thy will be done\" includes by the same inference this:--\"the other will be undone.\" This is the first great explanatory clause to be connected with this greatest prayer, \"Thy kingdom come.\" It gives the sweep of God's will in its broadest outlines.  The second clause included in the prayer, and added to make clear the swing of action is this--\"deliver us from the evil one.\" These two sentences, \"Thy will be done,\" and \"deliver us from the evil one,\" are naturally connected. Each statement includes the other. To have God's will fully done in us means emancipation from every influence of the evil one, either direct or indirect, or by hereditary taint. To be delivered from the evil one means that every thought and plan of God for our lives shall be fully carried out.  There are the two great wills at work in the world ever clashing in the action of history and in our individual lives. In many of us, aye, in all of us, though in greatly varying degree, these two wills constantly clash. Man is the real battle-field. The pitch of the battle is in his will. God will not do His will in a man without the man's will consenting. And Satan cannot. At the root the one thing that works against God's will is the evil one's will. And on the other hand the one thing that effectively thwarts Satan's plans is a man wholly given up to God's will.  The greatest prayer then fully expressed, sweeps first the whole field of action, then touches the heart of the action, and then attacks the opposition. It is this:--Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done: deliver us from the evil one. Every true prayer ever offered comes under this simple comprehensive prayer. It may be offered, it _is_ offered with an infinite variety of detail. It is greatest because of its sweep. It includes all other petitions, for God's will includes everything for which prayer is rightly offered. It is greatest in its intensity. It hits the very bull's-eye of opposition to God.     II. Hindrances to Prayer   1. Why the Results Fail. 2. Why the Results Are Delayed. 3. The Great Outside Hindrance, or, the Relation of Prayer to Satan.     Why the Results Fail    <u>Breaking with God.</u>   God answers prayer. Prayer is God and man joining hands to secure some high end. He joins with us through the communication of prayer in accomplishing certain great results. This is the main drive of prayer. Our asking and expecting and God's doing jointly bring to pass things that otherwise would not come to pass. Prayer changes things. This is the great fact of prayer.  Yet a great many prayers are not answered. Or, to put it more accurately, a great many prayers fail utterly of accomplishing any results. Probably it is accurate to say that _thousands_ of prayers go up and bring nothing down. This is certainly true. Let us say it just as bluntly and plainly as it can be said. As a result many persons are saying: \"Well, prayer is not what you claim for it: we prayed and no answer came: nothing was changed.\"  From all sorts of circles, and in all sorts of language comes this statement. Scholarly men who write with wisdom's words, and thoughtless people whose thinking never even pricks the skin of the subject, and all sorts of people in between group themselves together here. And they are right, quite right. The bother is that what they say is not all there is to be said. There is yet more to be said, that is right too, and that changes the final conclusion radically. Partial truth is a very mean sort of lie.  The prayer plan like many another has been much disturbed, and often broken. And one who would be a partner with God up to the limit of his power must understand the things that hinder the prayer plan. There are three sorts of hindrances to prayer. First of all there are things in us that _break off connection_ with God, the source of the changing power. Then there are certain things in us that _delay, or diminish_ the results; that interfere with the full swing of the prayer plan of operations. And then there is a great _outside_ hindrance to be reckoned upon. To-day we want to talk together of the first of these, namely, the hindrances that _break off connections_ between God and His human partner.  Here again there is a division into three. There are three things directly spoken of in the book of God that hinder prayer. One of these is a familiar thing. What a pity that repugnant things may become so familiar as no longer to repel. It is this:--_sin_ hinders prayer. In Isaiah's first chapter God Himself speaking says, \"When you stretch out your hands\"--the way they prayed, standing with outstretched hands--\"I will shut My eyes; when you make many prayers, I will shut My ears.\"[12] Why? What's the difficulty? These outstretched hands are _soiled!_ They are actually holding their sin-soiled hands up into God's face; and He is compelled to look at the thing most hateful to Him. In the fifty-ninth chapter of this same book,[13] God Himself is talking again. Listen \"Behold! the _Lord's_ hand is not shortened: _His_ ear is not heavy.\" There is no trouble on the _up_ side. God is all right. \"But\"--listen with both your ears--\"your _iniquities_ ... your _sins_ ... your _hands_ ... your _fingers_ ... your _lips_ ... your _tongue_ ...\" the slime of sin is oozing over everything! Turn back to that sixty-sixth Psalm[14]--\"if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.\" How much more if the sin of the heart get into the hands or the life! And the fact to put down plainly in blackest ink once for all is this--_sin hinders prayer_. There is nothing surprising about this. That we can think the reverse is the surprising thing. Prayer is transacting business with God. Sin is _breaking with God_.  Suppose I had a private wire from my apartments here to my home in Cleveland, and some one should go outside and drag the wire down until it touches the ground--a good square touch with the ground--the electricians would call it grounded, could I telegraph over that wire? Almost any child knows I could not. Suppose some one _cuts_ the wire, a good clean cut; the two ends are apart: not a mile; not a yard; but distinctly apart. Could I telegraph on that wire? Of course not. Yet I might sit in my room and tick "]]]
