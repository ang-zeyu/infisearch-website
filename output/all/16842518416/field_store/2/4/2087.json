Though the two men appeared to be talking earnestly, only a mumble of voices reached Dick's ears when the men were no more than thirty feet away.  Then they stepped into the road, where they halted hardly more than a dozen feet away from the screened captain.  \"It's a pity you wouldn't have your nerve,\" said the stranger, to Mock.  \"You tell me you hate your captain.\"  \"Wouldn't you, if he had treated you like he treated me?\" demanded Mock heatedly.  \"Surely I would,\" agreed the stranger.  \"And there's Holmes's friend, that fellow Prescott, who, he, you say, would spend all his time looking into anything that happened to Holmes.  You could settle with them both, and then there'd be no one left to worry about.\"  \"Say, just what are you thinking of doing to 'em?\" demanded Mock, in a tone of uneasy suspicion.  \"There are two things that could be done to them,\" continued the civilian.  \"One would be to put them out of the way altogether, and the other would be to bring disgrace upon them so that they'd be kicked out of the Army.  That would break their hearts, wouldn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" muttered Mock, \"but you're talking dreams, neighbor.  I'm no black-hander, to creep up behind them with a knife, or take a pot shot at them.  I'm not quite that kind, neighbor, and it couldn't be done, anyway.\"  \"You could put 'em out of the way, and no one would be the wiser,\" hinted the stranger.  \"How?\"  \"I'll show you, when I'm sure enough that you're game,\" declared the civilian.  \"I'd have to be sure you had the nerve.\"  \"I haven't,\" admitted Private Mock.  \"Do you know, I began to think that before you admitted it?\" sneered the other.  \"Not the way you mean,\" flared up the ex-sergeant.  \"I can be mean in order to get square with a mean officer.  But I can get along without putting him under the sod.  I'm a good hater, but my mother didn't raise me to be a real crook.\"  \"You're a quitter, I guess,\" jeered the other.  \"Anyway, if you claim to be a man of sand you'll have to show me.\"  \"And I guess it's about time that you showed me something, too,\" challenged Mock, looking furtively at the stoop-shouldered man.  \"I'm ready enough to show you a whole lot of things, when I find out that you're man enough to stand up for yourself and pay back those who treat you like dirt,\" retorted the other.  \"There's one thing you can show me, first of all,\" challenged Mock.  \"Yes?  What?\"  \"Show me why you're so anxious to have harm happen to Captain Holmes and Captain Prescott.\"  \"Because I like you; because I'm a friend of yours,\" returned the stoop-shouldered one.  \"You're a pretty new friend,\" Mock went on.  \"I never saw you until that day when the captain caught me shirking and told off two men to prod me back into camp.\"  \"That was the time for you to know me,\" declared the other brazenly. \"That was the time when you needed a friend to show you how to get square like a man instead of like a coward and a quitter.\"  \"Be careful with your names!\" commanded Mock harshly.  \"Say, Mr. Man, who are you, and what are you?\"  \"Private Mock, I believe I can answer that question for you!\" broke in Captain Dick Prescott, stepping out from behind his leafy screen.     CHAPTER VI  THE ENEMY IN CAMP BERRY   \"Captain Prescott!\" uttered Mock, starting back in dismay.  \"Donner und blitzen!\" (thunder and lightning) ejaculated the stoop-shouldered one.  \"The fellow has just answered your question for you,\" Dick went on, pointing an accusing finger at the stranger.  \"You know what language he was betrayed into using just now.\"  \"German, sir,\" said Mock.  \"That's right,\" nodded Prescott.  \"Is he one of them Kaiser-hound spies, sir?\" demanded Mock, stung to wrath and throwing grammar to the winds.  \"Why, I've dreamed of catching one and tearing him to pieces.  With your permission, sir-----!\"  Not stopping to finish Mock threw himself upon the stoop-shouldered one, But that worthy had foreseen it, and adroitly stopped the ex-sergeant with a blow on the end of the nose that dazed him for an instant.  \"I'll take care of him, Mock!\" cried Captain Dick, leaping forward. As he did so the stranger turned and fled.  No longer stoop-shouldered, but bearing himself like an athlete, the unknown turned and darted away, Prescott racing after him.  \"Get back!\" warned the fugitive, drawing an automatic revolver and flourishing it over his head.  Though unarmed, save for his fists, Prescott continued to pursue with all speed.  After both of them raced Private Mock.  Dick was gaining when he stepped on a round stone, slipped and fell.  Mock dashed after him.  The fleeing German halted long enough to hurl the automatic pistol at Mock's face, then turned and ran on.  Naturally the soldier dodged the missile, which struck the ground behind him.  Thinking the weapon might be useful, Mock halted, then ran back and secured the pistol, after which he started to give chase.  But the fugitive had vanished in the darkness.  \"Come back here and surrender, before I shoot,\" bluffed Mock, but the German did not answer.  To Mock's intense astonishment Dick reached over, snatching the pistol from his hand.  \"That will be about all, Private Mock,\" said Prescott sternly. \"You've bluffed your part well, and helped your friend to escape, but at all events I've got you!\"  \"Do you---\" began the soldier, but stopped, further words failing him.  Dick gripped the man's arm, giving a significant pressure before he said:  \"You'll come along with me, Mock, and it will be worse for you if you try any further monkey-shines with me.\"  He gave another pressure on Mock's arm as he finished.  Without a word Mock walked with him to where the horse was tied.  \"Untie that bridle and buckle the ends together,\" Dick ordered.  This done, the captain mounted, taking the bridle in his left hand, retaining the automatic pistol in his right.  \"March ahead, Mock.  Don't try to bolt unless you want me to shoot.\"  In this manner they proceeded back over the road.  Mile after mile they covered, meeting no one until they had come in sight of the camp, nestling in the broad valley below.  At this point such an extensive view could be had that Dick felt sure there was no eavesdropper.  So he dismounted, calling the soldier to him and asking in a whisper:  \"Mock, you were simply a poor, shirking soldier, weren't you? You are, at heart, loyal to your country's Flag, aren't you?\"  \"I'd die for the Stars and Stripes, sir!\" Mock declared, in a voice choked with emotion.  \"But I felt tired, the other day, and I got a notion Captain Holmes was down on me.  So I went bad and got busted.  Then I hated Captain Holmes, sir, and ached for a chance to get square with him.  Then that accursed carpenter fellow hunted me out, talked with me, and made me think he was my friend.  If I had known he was a Kaiser-hound I'd have split his head open at the first crack out of the box.\"  \"I didn't doubt you as a loyal man, Mock,\" Dick continued, in a whisper.  \"I spoke to you the way I did back on the road because I was sure the fellow was near and listening.  I didn't care much about catching him to-night because I hope to catch him later on, and get him even more red-handed.  Mock, you're loyal, and I'm going to put your loyalty, if you consent, to a hard, bitter test.\"  Dick went on in an even lower tone, Mock listening in growing astonishment, without replying a word, though he nodded understandingly.  \"So, now,\" Prescott wound up, \"I'm going to continue into camp with you still a prisoner and be mighty hard on you.  However, I won't hold the pistol on you any longer.\"  Into camp Dick marched the soldier, then over toward the buildings of the Ninety-ninth, and thence along to the bull-pen.  \"Sergeant of the guard!\" Prescott called briskly, and that non-commissioned officer appeared.  \"Take charge of Private Mock as a prisoner, charged with being absent from camp without leave or pass,\" Dick ordered.  \"I will report my action to Captain Holmes, who will dispose of his case.\"  From there Dick led the horse back to B company barracks, turned the animal over to an orderly and went into the company office, where, as he had expected, he found Greg immersed in a grind of paper work.  For a few minutes Dick talked earnestly with his chum in low tones, Captain Holmes frequently nodding.  \"And now, I think I had better go down to the adjutant's office, to see if he's still at his desk,\" Dick finished, \"and, if so, make my report.\"  \"You'll stagger him,\" Greg predicted.  One of Greg's orderlies had already ridden the major's horse to the stable, so Prescott walked briskly along the street until he came to regimental headquarters.  As he entered the adjutant's office he found Colonel Cleaves seated on the corner of his subordinate's desk, in low-toned conversation with his subordinate.  \"Am I intruding, sir?\" Dick inquired, saluting the colonel.  \"No,\" said Colonel Cleaves.  \"In fact, Captain, you may as well know the subject-matter of our conversation.  Captain Prescott, this camp would appear to be infested with German spies!  This evening sixteen men in F company were taken ill after supper. They are now in hospital and some of them are expected to die. The surgeons have examined some of the food left over from that supper and report finding ground glass in some pieces of the apple pie served as dessert.  Later the captain of our machine-gun company, which has only one machine gun so far, had the piece taken into the company mess-room to demonstrate the mechanism to his lieutenants so that they might instruct the men.  He found the mechanism of the piece so badly jammed that the machine gun refused to work. I have inspected that piece, and in my opinion the gun is ruined. As if that were not enough sixteen rifles belonging to G company have been found with their bolts broken off.  It is very plain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12810"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys with Pershing's Troops (#8)"],["body","German spies and sympathizers are at work in Camp Berry, and the scoundrels must be found, Captain.\"  Colonel Cleaves spoke under the stress of great excitement, his eyes flashing, the corners of his mouth twitching.  Dick went to the door, then to the doors opening into the rooms on either side.  Then he came back, saying in a low voice:  \"Colonel, I met one of the German spies tonight.  Perhaps the ring-leader.  If I see him again I shall recognize him and arrest him instantly.  Do you see what this is, sir?\"  Dick held up the weapon that the carpenter had hurled at Private Mock.  \"It is a 45-caliber, United States Government automatic pistol,\" said Colonel Cleaves.  \"Exactly, sir; and the spy I have mentioned had it in his possession. How he obtained it, I do not yet know, but I hope to find out.  And now, sir, I will tell you what happened and what action I took.\"  Thereupon Captain Dick Prescott narrated the amazing adventure of the evening, winding up with:  \"So, sir, I have placed Private Mock in arrest at the guard-house, and through his detention there I hope to gain the clues that shall lead us to the ferreting out and arrest of the whole crew of German spies at Camp Berry!\"     CHAPTER VII  AT GRIPS WITH GERMAN SPIES   New barracks buildings continued to spring up at Camp Berry.  Drafts of men for a National Army division began to arrive, besides a brigade of infantry, a regiment of field artillery and a machine-gun battalion of regulars.  Brigadier-General Bates arrived to take command of the regulars, while Major-general Timmins assumed command of the National Army division and became commanding general of the camp as well.  New batches of recruits, constantly arriving for the regulars, soon gave the Ninety-ninth an average of a hundred and eighty men to the company, or forty-five men to each platoon.  Drill went on as nearly incessantly during daylight as the men could endure.  \"In my opinion it won't be very long before the Ninety-ninth goes over and reports to General Pershing,\" Dick told his chum.  \"At the rate our ranks are being filled up we'll soon have a full-strength regiment.\"  \"But most of our men are still recruits,\" Holmes objected.  The regiment really isn't anywhere near fit for foreign service.\"  \"It won't be so many weeks before we're ordered abroad,\" Dick insisted.  \"Wait and see whether I'm right.\"  Wonderful indeed was the speed with which buildings were erected. The record time for constructing a two-story building with an office, supply room, mess-room and sleeping quarters for two hundred and fifty men was ninety minutes!  Fast, too, was the work done by the Regular Army regiments, which had this advantage over the National Army regiments, that most of their officers were trained regulars and a large proportion of them West Point graduates.  Of the sixteen men made ill by eating powdered glass not one died, for the glass had been ground too fine to do the utmost mischief. However, the camp was alarmed, and all food was kept under close guard and was regularly examined with care before being served.  Soldiers bearing German names were in some instances suspected, and unjustly.  Officers tried to undo this harm by talking among the men.  Yet all wondered what would be the next outbreak of spy work in camp.  Private Mock, sentenced to two weeks' arrest for being off the reservation without leave, served his sentence moodily, usually refusing to talk with his fellow-prisoners.  One Private Wilhelm was also serving a term in arrest at the bull-pen. His name was held against him Wilhelm as a brand-new man in the regiment, and one of the few with whom Mock would talk.  One morning the latter was overheard to say:  \"I'm sick of this war already.  I hope the Germans win.  If I'm sent over to France I'll watch my chance to desert and get over to the Germans.\"  \"Oh, ye will, will ye?\" demanded Private Riley, another prisoner in the bull-pen.  \"Ye dir-rty blackguard!\"  Buff!  The Irish soldier's fist caught Mock squarely on the jaw, sending him squarely to earth, though not knocking him out.  After a moment Mock was on his feet again, quivering with rage.  He flew at Riley, who was a smaller man, hammering him hard.  Other soldier-prisoners interfered on behalf of Riley, whereupon Private Wilhelm, a heavily built fellow, rushed to Mock's aid.  \"A German and a German sympathizer!\"  With that yell a dozen or so of time prisoners set upon the pair. Some lively and perhaps nearly deadly punishment would have been handed out, had not several men of the guard rushed in, thrusting with their rifle butts and breaking up the unequal fight.  But Mock was reported for his utterance, and Wilhelm for his sympathies.  Both were brought up before Captain Greg Holmes, and Dick was sent for to join in questioning the men, which was done behind closed doors.  At the end of the hearing Mock and Wilhelm were returned to the guard-house looking much crestfallen.  \"Did you hear what they said to me?\" Mock was overheard to demand of Wilhelm.  \"Said they'd have me tried for saying I'd desert, and that I'd be likely to get several years in prison for talking too much.  Oh, I'm sure sick of being in this man's army!\"  \"Sure!\" nodded Wilhelm, understandingly.  \"It's tough!\"  \"It'll be tougher, I warrant ye, if we hear ye two blackguards using any more of your line of talk around here,\" Riley broke in.  \"The guar-rd won't be forever stopping our pounding ye!\"  After that Mock and Wilhelm were left severely alone by their fellow-prisoners in the bull-pen.  Most of these men were serving merely sentences of a day to a week for minor infractions of discipline.  The next morning Private Riley managed to get word to Greg that Private Brown, of the guard, had been talking with Mock at the barbed wire of the pen enclosure.  \"Private Brown is supposed to be an all right soldier, but he'll bear watching,\" was Dick's comment when he heard the report.  That afternoon it was reported that both Mock and Wilhelm had been talking with Private Brown at the barbed wire fence.  Dick smiled grimly when he heard it.  The next morning orders were read releasing Mock, Wilhelm, Riley and some of the other soldier prisoners ahead of time that they might not be deprived of too much instruction.  The released ones were cautioned to be extremely careful, in the future, not to fall under the disciplinary ban.  \"Sure, I can understand some of us getting out, but not Mock,\" declared Riley to a bunkie (chum).  \"Him an' his talk about deserting to the enemy!\"  In the meantime Dick had given an accurate description of the carpenter who had tried to enlist Mock in some dangerous scheme of revenge.  The fellow had disappeared from among the gang of carpenters, and that was all that was known.  Secret Service men had been put on the trail, but had failed to find the fellow.  \"Now, maybe a soldier sometimes says more than he means,\" broke in Sergeant Kelly, who had come up behind the pair on the nearly deserted drill ground.  \"Soldiers are like other people in that respect.\"  \"But not Mock,\" Riley objected.  \"He's a bad egg.\"  \"I don't say he isn't,\" Kelly rejoined.  \"What I'm advising you is not to conclude that a man is worthless just because he talks. For that matter, Riley, I believe that the men we have most to fear are spies who manage to get in the Army, talk straight and do their work well, and all the time they're plotting all kinds of mischief.  Like the fellow or the chaps who put that powdered glass in the chow of F company not long ago.\"  \"Here's hoping I live to see Mock hanged!\" grumbled Private Riley, as Sergeant Kelly moved away.  Kelly, who had served as sergeant with Dick in other regiments, had followed him into the Ninety-ninth.  Prescott rejoiced that he had this excellent fellow with him, as capable first sergeants are always looked upon in the light of prizes.  Yet, in a---to him---new man Greg Holmes had an almost equally good top in Lund, a Swede who had put in ten years in the Army.  When Greg dropped into the company office that forenoon, Lund handed him a list of men who had put in application for pass that afternoon.  It was to be a visitors' afternoon, and there would be no drills.  \"Nineteen, and all good conduct men, Sergeant Lund,\" commented Greg, glancing over the list and reaching for a pencil with which to O.K. the list.  \"And two more put in application, but I didn't put their names down, sir,\" Lund explained, as he stood at the side of the young captain at the desk.  \"Who were they?\"  \"Mock and Wilhelm.\"  \"Have they behaved themselves since they got out of arrest?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir.\"  \"Then we'll let them off this afternoon,\" proposed Holmes amiably, as he wrote time two names down on the list.  \"Perhaps they'll turn out better for a bit of considerate treatment.\"  Though Lund frowned as he received the list back in his own hand he made no comment.  Immediately after the noon meal Mock and Wilhelm exhibited their passes to the guard and walked briskly out of camp.  \"Look at that now---the pair of traitors!\" muttered Private Riley, as he spat vengefully on the ground.  \"Me, I knew better than to ask for it, and me so lately out of the pen.  But those bir-rds with dir-rty feathers get their chance to go off the reservation and plot more mischief.\"  Had Private Riley been able to follow the pair unseen he would have been even angrier.  Mock and Wilhelm, stepping briskly along the road over which Dick had ridden that eventful evening, kept on for some three miles, then turned abruptly off into the forest.  For another half mile they kept on, going further and further from the road.  \"Here's the spot,\" said Mock, after some hunting under the trees. \"It must be the place, for it has the nail driven into the tree trunk.\"  \"Sure, it's the place all right,\" Wilhelm agreed.  Mock emitted a shrill whistle that would not, however, carry very far.  Instantly there came an answering whistle.  \"And here we are!\" spoke up"]]]
