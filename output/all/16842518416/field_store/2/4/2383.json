I had sized the Colonel up as a dead stringy old proposition, too.  He was one of these big-chopped fellers with a mouth set more'n half way up from his chin and little thin lips like the edge of a knife blade, and just as full of blood--face, big and rustic-finished.  \"I says to myself, 'Bud, it looks like you wouldn't be forced to prospect for a living any more this season.  If that old sport turns himself loose you're going to get 'life' three times and a holdover.'  \"Next morning they tried every way to make me talk.  Once in a while the old man looked at me puzzled and searching, but I didn't know him from a sweat-pad, and just paid strict attention to being dumb.  \"It was mighty hard, too.  I got so nervous my mouth simply ached to let out a cayoodle.  The words kept trying to crawl through my sesophagus, and when I backed 'em up, they slid down and stood around in groups, hanging onto the straps, gradually filling me with witful gems of thought.  \"The Colonel talked to me serious and quiet, like I had good ears, and says, 'My man, you can understand every word I say, I'm sure, and what your object is in maintaining this ridiculous silence, I don't know.  You're accused of a crime, and it looks serious for you.\"  \"Then he gazes at me queer and intent, and says, 'If you only knew how bad you are making your case you'd make a clean breast of it. Come now, let's get at the truth.'  \"Them thought jewels and wads of repartee was piling up in me fast, like tailings from a ground-sluice, till I could feel myself getting bloated and pussy with langwidge, but I thought, 'No! to-morrow Kink 'll be safe, and then I'll throw a jolt into this man's camp that'll go down in history.  They'll think some Chinaman's been thawing out a box of giant powder when I let out my roar.'  \"I goes to the guard-house again, with a soldier at my back. Everything would have been all right if we hadn't run into a mule team.  \"They had been freighting from the railroad, and as we left the barracks we ran afoul of four outfits, three span to the wagon, with the loads piled on till the teams was all lather and the wheels complainin' to the gods, trying to pass the corner of the barracks where there was a narrow opening between the buildings.  \"Now a good mule-driver is the littlest, orneriest speck in the human line that's known to the microscope, but when you get a poor one, he'd spoil one of them cholera germs you read about just by contact. The leader of this bunch was worse than the worst; strong on whip-arm, but surprising weak on judgment.  He tried to make the turn, run plump into the corner of the building, stopped, backed, swung, and proceeded to get into grief.  \"The mules being hot and nervous, he sent them all to the loco patch instanter.  They began to plunge and turn and back and snarl.  Before you could say 'Craps! you lose,' them shave-tails was giving the grandest exhibition of animal idiocy in the Territory, barring the teamster.  He follered their trail to the madhouse, yanking the mouths out of them, cruel and vicious.  \"Now, one mule can cause a heap of tribulation, and six mules can break a man's heart, but there wasn't no excuse for that driver to stand up on his hind legs, close his eyes, and throw thirty foot of lash into that plunging buckin', white-eyed mess.  When he did it, all the little words inside of me began to foam and fizzle like sedlitz; out they came, biting, in mouthfuls, and streams, and squirts, backwards, sideways, and through my nose.  \"'Here! you infernal half-spiled, dog-robbing walloper,' I says; 'you don't know enough to drive puddle ducks to a pond.  You quit heaving that quirt or I'll harm you past healing.'  \"He turned his head and grit out something through his teeth that stimulated my circulation.  I skipped over the wheels and put my left onto his neck, fingering the keys on his blow-pipe like a flute. Then I give him a toss and gathered up the lines.  Say! it was like the smell of grease-paint to an actor man for me to feel the ribbons again, and them mules knew they had a chairman who savvied 'em too, and had mule talk pat, from soda to hock.  \"I just intimated things over them with that whip, and talked to them like they was my own flesh and blood.  I starts at the worst words the English langwidge and the range had produced, to date, and got steadily and rapidly worse as long as I talked.  \"Arizony may be slow in the matter of standing collars and rag-time, but she leads the world in profanity.  Without being swelled on myself, I'll say, too, that I once had more'n a local reputation in that line, having originated some quaint and feeling conceits which has won modest attention, and this day I was certainly trained to the minute.  \"I addressed them brutes fast and earnest for five minutes steady, and never crossed my trail or repeated a thought.  \"It must have been sacred and beautiful.  Anyhow, it was strong enough to soak into their pores so that they strung out straight as a chalk-line.  Then I lifted them into the collars, and we rumbled past the building, swung in front of the commissary door, cramped and stopped.  With the wheelers on their haunches, I backed up to the door square as a die.  \"I wiped the sweat out of my eyes and looked up into the grinning face of about fifty swatties, realizing I was a mute--and a prisoner.  \"I heard a voice say, 'Bring me that man.'  There stood the Colonel oozing out wrath at every pore.  \"I parted from that wagon hesitating and reluctant, but two soldiers to each leg will bust any man's grip, I lost some clothes, too, after we hit the ground, but I needed the exercise.  \"The old man was alone in his office when they dragged me in, and he sent my guards out.  \"'So you found your voice, did you?' he says.  \"'Yes, sir,\" I answers.  'It came back unexpected, regular miracle.'  \"'He drummed on the table for a long time, and then says, sort of immaterial and irreverent, 'You're a pretty good mule puncher, eh?'  \"'It ain't for me to say I'm the best in the Territory,' I says; 'but I'm curious to meet the feller that claims the title.'  \"He continues, 'It reminds me of an exhibition I saw once, back in New Mexico, long time ago, at the little Flatwater Canyon.'  \"'Maybe you've heard tell of the fight there when the Apaches were up?  Yes?  Well, I happened to be in that scrimmage.'  \"'I was detailed with ten men to convoy a wagon train through to Fort Lewis.  We had no trouble till we came to the end of that canyon, just where she breaks out onto the flats.  There we got it.  They were hidden up on the ridges; we lost two men and one wagon before we could get out onto the prairie.  \"'I got touched up in the neck, first clatter, and was bleeding pretty badly; still I hung to my horse, and we stood 'em off till the teams made it out of the gulch; but just as we came out my horse fell and threw me--broke his leg.  I yelled to the boys:  \"'\"Go on!  For God's sake go on!\"  Any delay there meant loss of the whole outfit.  Besides, the boys had more than they could manage, Injuns on three sides.  \"'We had a young Texan driving the last wagon.  When I went down he swung those six mules of his and came back up that trail into the gut, where the bullets snapped like grasshoppers.  \"'It was the prettiest bit of driving I ever saw, not to mention nerve.  He whirled the outfit between me and the bluff on two wheels, yelling, \"Climb on!  Climb on!  We ain't going to stay long!\"  I was just able to make it onto the seat.  In the turn they dropped one of his wheelers.  He ran out on the tongue and cut the brute loose.  We went rattling down the gulch behind five mules.  All the time there came out of that man's lungs the fiercest stream of profanity my ears ever burned under.  I was pretty sick for a few weeks, so I never got a chance to thank that teamster.  He certainly knew the mind of an army mule, though.  His name was--let me see--Wiggins--yes, Wiggins.  \"'Oh, no it wasn't,' I breaks in, foolish; 'it was Joyce.'  \"Then I stopped and felt like a kid, for the Colonel comes up and shuts the circulation out of both my hands.  \"'I wasn't sure of you, Bill,' he says, 'till I saw you preside over those mules out there and heard your speech--then I recognized the gift.'  He laughed like a boy, still making free with my hands.  'I'm darn glad to see you, Bill Joyce.  Now then,' he says, 'tell me all about this killing up in the hills,' and I done so.  \"After I finished he never said anything for a long time, just drummed the desk again and looked thoughtful.  \"'It's too bad you didn't speak out, Bill, when you first came in. Now, you've showed everybody that you can talk--just a little, anyhow,' and he smiles, 'and they all think you're the man caused the trouble.  I don't see but that you've got to stand trial.  I wish I could help you, Bill.'  \"'But see here, Colonel,' I says; 'I couldn't squeal on Kink.  We're _pardners_.  I just _had_ to give him a chance to cut.  I played dumb 'cause I knew if I talked at all, being simple and guileless, you all would twist me up and have the whole thing in a jiffy.  That man give me the last drop of water in his canteen on the Mojave, and him with his own tongue swelled clean out of his mouth, too.  When we was snowed in, up in the Bitter Roots, with me snow-blind and starving, he crawled from Sheeps-Horn clean to Miller's--snow twelve foot deep, too, and nary a snow-shoe in miles, but he brought the outfit in to where I was lyin' 'bout gone in.  He lost some fingers and more toes wallering through them mountain drifts that day, but he never laid down till he brought the boys back.  \"'Colonel! we've slept on the same blanket, we've et the same grub, we've made and lost together, and I had to give him a show, that's all.  I'm into this here trouble now.  Tell me how I'm going to get out.  What would you do?'  \"He turns to the open"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13135"],["title","Pardners (#6)"],["body","and says: 'Partners are partners! That's my horse out there at that post.  If I were you I'd run like hell.'  \"That was the willingest horse I ever rode, and I hated to sell him, but he was tolable used up when I got across the line.\"  THE COLONEL AND THE HORSE-THIEF  Those marks on my arm?  Oh!  I got 'em playin' horse-thief.  Yes, playin'.  I wasn't a real one, you know--Well, I s'pose it was sort of a queer game.  Came near bein' my last too, and if Black Hawk hadn't been the best horse in Texas the old Colonel would've killed me sure.  He chased me six miles as it was--me with one arm full of his buckshot and anxious to explain, and him strainin' to get in range again and not wishin' any further particulars.  That was way back in the sixties, when I was as wild a lad as ever straddled a pony.  You see five of us had gone over into the Crow Nation to race horses with the Indians, and it was on the way back that the old man and the bullet holes figger in the story.  At the beginnin' it was Jim Barrett's plan, and it had jest enough risk and devilment in it to suit a harum-scarum young feller like me; so we got five of the boys who had good horses, lumped together all of our money, and rode out to invade the reservation.  You know how an Indian loves to run horses?  Well, the Crows had a good deal of money then, and our scheme was to go over there, get up a big race, back our horses with all we had, and take down the wealth.  Takin' chances?  Don't you believe it.  That's where the beauty of Jim's plan commenced to sort of shine through.  You see, as soon as the money was up and the horses started, every Indian would be watchin' the race and yellin' at the nags, then, in the confusion, our boys was to grab the whole pot, Indian's money and ours too, and we'd make our get away across the river back into Texas.  We figured that we could get a few minutes start of 'em, and, with the horses we had under us, there wasn't much danger of their gettin' in range before we crossed back to where they couldn't follow us.  Well, sir!  I never see anything work out like that scheme did.  Them Crows was dead anxious to run their ponies and seemed skeered that we wouldn't let 'em get all their money up.  As we was eatin' supper the night before the race, Donnelly says: \"Boys, I'm sore that we didn't have more coin.  If we'd worked 'em right they'd 'a' give us odds.  We could 'a' got five to three anyhow, and maybe more.\"  \"They shore have got a heap of confidence in them skates of their'n,\" says Kink Martin.  \"I never see anybody so anxious to play a race in my life.  If it wasn't all planned out the way it is, I'd like to stick and see which hoss is the best.  I'd back Black Hawk agin any hunk of meat in the Territory, with the Kid here in the saddle.\"  They'd ribbed it up for me to ride Martin's mare, Black Hawk, while a little feller named Hollis rode his own horse.  Donnelly's part was to stay in the saddle and keep the other horses close to Barrett and Martin.  They was to stick next to the money, and one of 'em do the bearin' off of the booty while the other made the protection play.  We hoped in the excitement to get off without harmin' any of Uncle Sam's pets, but all three of the boys had been with the Rangers and I knew if it came to a show down, they wouldn't hesitate to \"pot\" one or two in gittin' away.  We rode out from camp the next mornin' to where we'd staked out a mile track on the prairie and it seemed as if the whole Crow Nation was there, and nary a white but us five.  They'd entered two pretty good-lookin' horses and had their jockeys stripped down to breech-clouts, while Hollis and me wore our whole outfits on our backs, as we didn't exactly figger on dressin' after the race, leastways, not on that side of the river.  Just before we lined up, Jim says: \"Now you ---- all ride like ----, and when you git to the far turn we'll let the guns loose and stampede the crowd.  Then jest leave the track and make a break fer the river, everybody fer himself.  We'll all meet at them cottonwoods on the other side, so we can stand 'em off if they try to swim across after us.\"  That would have been a sure enough hot race if we had run it out, for we all four got as pretty a start as I ever see and went down the line all together with a-bangin' of hoofs and Indian yells ringin' in our ears.  I had begun to work Black Hawk out of the bunch to get a clear start across the prairie at the turn, when I heard the guns begin snappin' like pop-corn.  \"They've started already,\" yelled Hollis, and we turned the rearin' horses toward the river, three miles away, leavin' them two savages tearin' down the track like mad.  I glanced back as I turned, but, instead of seein' the boys in the midst of a decent retreat, the crowd was swarmin' after 'em like a nest of angry hornets, while Donnelly, with his reins between his teeth, was blazin' away at three reds who were right at Barrett's heels as he ran for his horse.  Martin was lashin' his jumpin' cayuse away from the mob which sputtered and spit angry shots after him. Bucks were runnin' here and there and hastily mountin' their ponies--while an angry roar came to me, punctuated by the poppin' of the guns.  Hollis and I reached the river and swam it half a mile ahead of the others and their yellin' bunch of trailers, so we were able to protect 'em in their crossin'.  I could see from their actions that Bennett and Martin was both hurt and I judged the deal hadn't panned out exactly accordin' to specifications.  The Crows didn't attempt to cross in the teeth of our fire, however, being satisfied with what they'd done, and the horses safely brought our three comrades drippin' up the bank to where we lay takin' pot-shots at every bunch of feathers that approached the opposite bank.  We got Barrett's arm into a sling, and, as Martin's hurt wasn't serious, we lost no time in gettin' away.  \"They simply beat us to it,\" complained Barrett, as we rode south. \"You all had jest started when young Long Hair grabs the sack and ducks through the crowd, and the whole bunch turns loose on us at once.  We wasn't expectin' anything so early in the game, and they winged me the first clatter.  I thought sure it was oft with me when I got this bullet in the shoulder, but I used the gun in my left hand and broke for the nearest pony.\"  \"They got me, too, before I saw what was up,\" added Martin; \"but I tore out of there like a jack-rabbit.  It was all done so cussed quick that the first thing I knew I'd straddled my horse and was makin' tracks.  Who'd a thought them durned Indians was dishonest enough fer a trick like that?\"  Then Donnelly spoke up and says: \"Boys, as fur as the coin goes, we're out an' injured; we jest made a 'Mexican stand-off'--lost our money, but saved our lives--and mighty lucky at that, from appearances.  What I want to know now is, how we're all goin' to get home, clean across the State of Texas, without a dollar in the outfit, and no assets but our guns and the nags.\"  That was a sure tough proposition, and we had left it teetotally out of calculations.  We'd bet every bean on that race, not seein' how we could lose.  In them days there wasn't a railroad in that section, ranches were scatterin', and people weren't givin' pink teas to every stranger that rode up--especially when they were as hard-lookin' as we were.  \"We've got to eat, and so's the horses,\" says Hollis, \"but no rancher is goin' to welcome with open arms as disreputable an outfit as we are.  Two men shot up, and the rest of us without beddin', grub, money, or explanations.  Them's what we need--explanations.  I don't exactly see how we're goin' to explain our fix to the honest hay-diggers, either.  Everybody'll think some sheriff is after us, and two to one they'll put some officer on our trail, and we'll have more trouble.  I believe I've had all I want for awhile.\"  \"I'll tell you how we'll work it,\" I says.  \"One of us'll be the sheriff of Guadalupe County, back home, with three deputies, bringin' back a prisoner that we've chased across the State.  We'll ride up to a ranch an' demand lodgin' for ourselves and prisoner in the name of the State of Texas and say that we'll pay with vouchers on the county in the morning.\"  \"No, sir! not fer me,\" says Martin.  \"I'm not goin' in fer forgery. It's all right to practice a little mild deception on our red brothers, as we figgered on doing, but I'm not goin' to try to flimflam the State of Texas.  Our troubles 'd only be startin' if we began that game.\"  \"Your plan's all right, Kid,\" says Bennett to me.  \"You be the terrible desperado that I'm bringin' home after a bloody fight, where you wounded Martin and me, and 'most escaped.  You'll have ev'ry rancher's wife givin' you flowers and weepin' over your youth and kissin' you good-bye.  In the mornin', when we're ready to go and I'm about to fix up the vouchers for our host, you break away and ride like the devil.  We'll all tear off a few shots and foller in a hurry, leavin' the farmer hopin' that the villain is recaptured and the girls tearfully prayin' that the gallunt and misguided youth escapes.\"  It seemed to be about our only resort, as the country was full of bad men, and we were liable to get turned down cold if we didn't have some story, so we decided to try it on.  We rode up to a ranch 'bout dark, that night, me between the others, with my hands tied behind me, and Jim called the owner out.  \"I want a night's lodgin' fer my deputies and our prisoner,\" he says. \"I'm the sheriff of Guadalupe County, and I'll fix up the bill in the mornin'.\"  \"Come in!  Come in!\" the feller says, callin' a man for the horses. \"Glad to accommodate you.  Who's your prisoner?\"  \"That's Texas Charlie that robbed the Bank of Euclid single-handed,\" answers Jim.  \"He give us a long run clean across the State, but we got him jest as he was settin' over into the Indian Territory. Fought like a tiger.\"  It worked fine.  The feller,"]]]
