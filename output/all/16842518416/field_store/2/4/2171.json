And here is a sudden fanciful turn. A festive dance strikes a tuneful trip,--a menuet it surely is, with all the ancient festal charm, vibrant with tune and spring, though still we do not escape the source of the first pervading theme. Out of the midst of the dance sings slyly an enchanting phrase, much like a secret love-romance. Now to the light continuing dance is joined a strange companion,--the heroic melody in its earlier majestic pace. Is it the poet in serious meditation at the feast apart from the joyous abandon, or do we see him laurel-crowned, a centre of the festival, while the gay dancers flit about him in homage?  More and more brilliant grows the scene, though ever with the dominant grave figure. With sudden stroke as of fatal blast returns the earlier fierce burst of revolt, rising to agitation of the former lament, blending both moods and motives, and ending with a broader stress of the first tragic motto.  Now, _Allegro con brio_, with herald calls of the brass and fanfare of running strings (drawn from the personal theme), in bright major the whole song bursts forth in brilliant gladness. At the height the exaltation finds vent in a peal of simple melody. The \"triumph\" follows in broadest, royal pace of the main song in the wind, while the strings are madly coursing and the basses reiterate the transformed motive of the cadence. The end is a revel of jubilation.   _MAZEPPA_  The Mazeppa music is based upon Victor Hugo's poem, in turn founded upon Byron's verse, with an added stirring touch of allegory.  The verses of Hugo first tell how the victim is tied to the fiery steed, how--      \"He turns in the toils like a serpent in madness,     And ... his tormentors have feasted in gladness         Upon his despair.             *       *       *       *       *      \"They fly.--Empty space is behind and before them             *       *       *       *       *      \"The horse, neither bridle nor bit on him feeling,     Flies ever; red drops o'er the victim are stealing:         His whole body bleeds.     Alas! to the wild horses foaming and champing     That followed with mane erect, neighing and stamping,         A crow-flight succeeds.     The raven, the horn'd owl with eyes round and hollow,     The osprey and eagle from battle-field follow,         Though daylight alarm.             *       *       *       *       *      \"Then after three days of this course wild and frantic,     Through rivers of ice, plains and forests gigantic,         The horse sinks and dies;             *       *       *       *       *      \"Yet mark! That poor sufferer, gasping and moaning,     To-morrow the Cossacks of Ukraine atoning,         Will hail as their King;             *       *       *       *       *      \"To royal Mazeppa the hordes Asiatic     Will show their devotion in fervor ecstatic,         And low to earth bow.\"  In his splendid epilogue the poet likens the hero to the mortal on whom the god has set his mark. He sees himself bound living to the fatal course of genius, the fiery steed.      \"Away from the world--from all real existence     He is borne upwards, despite his resistance         On feet of steel.     He is taken o'er deserts, o'er mountains in legions,     Grey-hoary, thro' oceans, and into the regions         Far over the clouds;     A thousand base spirits his progress unshaken     Arouses, press round him and stare as they waken,         In insolent crowds             *       *       *       *       *      \"He cries out with terror, in agony grasping,     Yet ever the mane of his Pegasus clasping,         They heavenward spring;     Each leap that he takes with fresh woe is attended;     He totters--falls lifeless--the struggle is ended--         And rises as King!\"[A]  [Footnote A: The English verses are taken for the most part from the translation of F. Corder.]  The original _Allegro agitato_ in broad 6/4 time (aptly suggestive of the unbridled motion) grows  [Music: (In brass and strings with lower 8ve.) (With constant clattering higher strings and chord of low wind on the middle beat)]  more rapid into an _alla breve_ pace (in two beats), with dazzling maze of lesser rhythms. Throughout the work a song of primeval strain prevails. Here and there a tinge of foreshadowing pain appears, as the song sounds on high, _espressivo dolente_. But the fervor and fury of movement is undiminished. The brief touch of pathos soon merges in the general heroic mood. Later, the whole motion ceases, \"the horse sinks and dies,\" and now an interlude sings a pure plaint (in the strain of the main motive). Then, _Allegro_, the martial note clangs in stirring trumpet and breaks into formal song of war, _Allegro marziale_.  [Music: (Brass and strings) _Allegro marziale_ (With lower 8ve.)]  In the wake of this song, with a relentless trip and tramp of warrior hordes, is the real clash and jingle of the battle, where the sparkling thrill of strings and the saucy counter theme are strong elements in the stirring beauty.  There is a touch here of the old Goth, or rather the Hun, nearer akin to the composer's race.  At the height rings out the main tune of yore, transformed in triumphant majesty.  The musical design embraces various phases. First is the clear rhythmic sense of the ride. We think of other instances like Schubert's \"Erl-King\" or the ghostly ride in Raff's \"Lenore\" Symphony.  The degree of vivid description must vary, not only with the composer, but with the hearer. The greatest masters have yielded to the variety of the actual graphic touch. And, too, there are always interpreters who find it, even if it was never intended. Thus it is common to hear at the very beginning of the \"Mazeppa\" music the cry that goes up as starts the flight.  We are of course entitled, if we prefer, to feel the poetry rather than the picture. Finally it is probably true that such a poetic design is not marred merely because there is here or there a trick of onomatopoeia; if it is permitted in poetry, why not in music? It may be no more than a spur to the fancy, a quick conjuring of the association.   _HUNNENSCHLACHT--\"THE BATTLE OF THE HUNS\"_  Liszt's symphonic poem, \"Hunnenschlacht,\" one of the last of his works in this form, completed in 1857, was directly inspired by the picture of the German painter, Wilhelm Kaulbach, which represents the legend of the aerial battle between the spirits of the Romans and Huns who had fallen outside of the walls of Rome.[A]  [Footnote A: A description of the picture is cited by Lawrence Gilman in his book, \"Stories of Symphonic Music,\" as follows:  \"According to a legend, the combatants were so exasperated that the slain rose during the night and fought in the air. Rome, which is seen in the background, is said to have been the scene of this event. Above, borne on a shield, is Attila, with a scourge in his hand; opposite him Theodoric, King of the Visigoths. The foreground is a battle-field, strewn with corpses, which are seen to be gradually reviving, rising up and rallying, while among them wander wailing and lamenting women.\"]  The evidence of the composer's intent is embodied in a letter written in 1857 to the wife of the painter, which accompanied the manuscript of an arrangement of the music for two pianos. In the letter Liszt speaks of \"the meteoric and solar light which I have borrowed from the painting, and which at the Finale I have formed into one whole by the gradual working up of the Catholic _choral_ 'Crux fidelis,' and the meteoric sparks blended therewith.\" He continues: \"As I have already intimated to Kaulbach, in Munich, I was led by the musical demands of the material to give proportionately more place to the solar light of Christianity, personified in the Catholic _choral_ ... than appears to be the case in the glorious painting, in order to win and pregnantly represent the conclusion of the Victory of the Cross, with which I both as a Catholic and as a man could not dispense.\"  The work begins _tempestuoso_ (_allegro non troppo_), with a nervous theme over soft rolling drums and  [Music: _Tempestuoso. Allegro non troppo_ (Bassoons with _tremolo_ cellos and roll of kettle-drums)]  trembling low strings, that is taken up as in fugue by successive groups and carried to a height where enters a fierce call of the horns. The cries of battle spread with increasing din and gathering speed. At the first climax the whole motion has a new energy, as the strings in feverish chase attack the quickened motive with violent stress. Later, though the motion has not lessened, the theme has returned to a semblance of its former pace, and again the cries of battle (in brass and wood) sound across its path.  [Music: (Strings, _tremolo_, doubled above) (Horns)]  In the hush of the storm the full-blown call to arms is heard in lowest, funereal tones. Of a sudden, though the speed is the same, the pace changes with a certain terror as of a cavalry attack. Presently amid the clattering tramp sounds the big hymn,--in the ancient rhythm that moves strangely out of the rut of even time.[A]  [Footnote A: Quoted on the following page.]  A single line of the hymn is followed by a refrain of the battle-call, and by the charge of horse that brings back the hymn, in high pitch of trumpets. And so recur the former phases of battle,--really of threat and preparation. For now begins the serious fray in one long gathering of speed and power. The first theme here grows to full melodic song, with extended answer, led by strepitous band of lower reed over a heavy clatter of strings. We are in a  [Music: (Trombones with lower 8ve) _Marcato_]  maze of furious charges and cries, till the shrill trumpet and the stentorian trombone strike the full call in antiphonal song. The tempest increases with a renewed charge of the strings, and now the more distant calls have a slower sweep. Later the battle song is in the basses,--again in clashing basses and trebles; nearer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12903"],["title","Symphonies and Their Meaning; Third Series, Modern Symphonies (#7)"],["body","the broad sweeping calls.  Suddenly over the hushed motion in soothing harmonies sings the hymn in pious choir of all the brass. Then the gathering speed and volume is merged in a majestic tread as of ordered array (_Maestoso assai; Andante_); a brief spirited prelude of martial motives is answered by the soft religious strains of the organ on the line of the hymn:      \"Crux fidelis, inter omnes     Arbor una nobilis,     Nulla silva talem profert     Fronde, flore, germine.     Dulce lignum, dulces clavos,     Dulce pondus sustinet.\"[A]  [Footnote A:      Faithful cross, among the trees     Thou the noblest of them all!     Forest ne'er doth grow a like     In leaf, in flower or in seed.     Blessed wood and blessed nails,     Blessed burden that it bears!]  As in solemn liturgy come the answering phrases of the organ and the big chorus in martial tread. As the hymn winds its further course, violins entwine about the harmonies. The last line ends in expressive strain and warm line of new major tone,--echoed in interluding organ and violins.  Suddenly a strict, solemn tread, with sharp stress of violins, brings a new song of the _choral_. Strings alone play here \"with pious expression\"; gradually reeds add support and ornament. A lingering phrase ascends on celestial harmonies. With a stern shock the plain hymn strikes in the reed, against a rapid course of strings, with fateful tread. In interlude sound the battle-cries of yore. Again the hymn ends in the expressive cadence, though now it grows to a height of power.  Here a former figure (the first motive of the battle) reappears in a new guise of bright major,[A] in full, spirited stride, and leads once more to a blast of the hymn, with organ and all, the air in unison of trumpets and all the wood. The expressive cadence merges into a last fanfare of battle, followed by a strain of hymns and with reverberating Amens, where the organ predominates and holds long after all other sounds have ceased.  [Footnote A: In the whole tonality we may see the \"meteoric and solar light\" of which the composer speaks in the letter quoted above.]     CHAPTER VI  THE SYMPHONIC POEMS OF SAINT-SAËNS   There is something charming and even ideal in a complete versatility, quite apart from the depth of the separate poems, where there is a never-failing touch of grace and of distinction. The Philip Sydneys are quite as important as the Miltons, perhaps they are as great. Some poets seem to achieve an expression in a certain cyclic or sporadic career of their fancy, touching on this or that form, illuminating with an elusive light the various corners of the garden. Their individual expression lies in the _ensemble_ of these touches, rather than in a single profound revelation.  A symptom of the eminence of Saint-Saëns in the history of French music lies in his attitude towards the art as a whole, especially of the German masters,--the absence of national bias in his perceptions. He was foremost in revealing to his countrymen the greatness of Bach, Beethoven and Schumann. Without their influence the present high state of French music can hardly be conceived.  It is part of a broad and versatile mastery that it is difficult to analyze. Thus it is not easy to find salient traits in the art of M. Saint-Saëns. We are apt to think mainly of the distinguished beauty of his harmonies, until we remember his subtle counterpoint, or in turn the brilliancy of his orchestration. The one trait that he has above his contemporaries is an inbred refinement and restraint,--a thorough-going workmanship. If he does not share a certain overwrought emotionalism that is much affected nowadays, there is here no limitation--rather a distinction. Aside from the general charm of his art, Saint-Saëns found in the symphonic poem his one special form, so that it seemed Liszt had created it less for himself than for his French successor. A fine reserve of poetic temper saved him from hysterical excess. He never lost the music in the story, disdaining the mere rude graphic stroke; in his dramatic symbols a musical charm is ever commingled. And a like poise helped him to a right plot and point in his descriptions. So his symphonic poems must ever be enjoyed mainly for the music, with perhaps a revery upon the poetic story. With a less brilliant vein of melody, though they are not so Promethean in reach as those of Liszt, they are more complete in the musical and in the narrative effect.   _DANSE MACABRE_  Challenged for a choice among the works of the versatile composer, we should hit upon the _Danse Macabre_ as the most original, profound and essentially beautiful of all. It is free from certain lacks that one feels in other works, with all their charm,--a shallowness and almost frivolity; a facility of theme approaching the commonplace.  There is here an eccentric quality of humor, a daemonic conceit that reach the height of other classic expression of the supernatural.  The music is founded upon certain lines of a poem of _Henri Calais_ (under a like title), that may be given as follows:            Zig-a-zig, zig-a-zig-a-zig,     Death knocks on the tomb with rhythmic heel.           Zig-a-zig, zig-a-zig-zig,     Death fiddles at midnight a ghostly reel.      The winter wind whistles, dark is the night;       Dull groans behind the lindens grow loud;     Back and forth fly the skeletons white,       Running and leaping each under his shroud.     Zig-a-zig-a-zig, how it makes you quake,     As you hear the bones of the dancers shake.             *       *       *       *       *      But hist! all at once they vanish away,     The cock has hailed the dawn of day.  The magic midnight strokes sound clear and sharp. In eager chords of tuned pitch the fiddling ghost summons the dancing groups, where the single fife is soon followed by demon violins.  Broadly sings now the descending tune half-way between a wail and a laugh. And ever in interlude is the skipping, mincing step,--here of reeds answered by solo violin with a light clank of cymbals. Answering the summoning fifes, the unison troop of fiddlers dance the main step to bright strokes of triangle, then the main ghostly violin trips in with choir of wind. And broadly again sweeps the song between tears and  [Music: _In waltz rhythm_ (Flute) (Harp, with sustained bass note of strings)]  smiles. Or Death fiddles the first strain of reel for the tumultuous answer of chorus.  Now they build a busy, bustling fugue (of the descending song) and at the serious moment suddenly  [Music: (Solo violin) _Largamente_ (_Pizz._ strings)]  they skip away in new frolicsome, all but joyous, tune: a shadowy counterfeit of gladness, where the sob hangs on the edge of the smile. As if it could no longer be contained, now pours the full passionate grief of the broad descending strain. Death fiddles his mournful chant to echoing, expressive wind. On the abandon of grief follows the revel of grim humor in pranks of mocking demons. All the strains are mingled in the ghostly bacchanale. The descending song is answered in opposite melody. A chorus of laughter follows the tripping dance. The summoning chords, acclaimed by chorus, grow to appealing song in a brief lull. At the height, to the united skipping dance of overpowering chorus the brass blows the full verse of descending song. The rest is a mad storm of carousing till ... out of the whirling darkness sudden starts the sharp, sheer call of prosaic day, in high, shrill reed. On a minishing sound of rolling drum and trembling strings, sings a brief line of wistful rhapsody of the departing spirit before the last whisking steps.   _PHAETON_  On a separate page between title and score is a \"_Notice_,\"--an epitome of the story of Phaeton, as follows:  \"Phaeton has been permitted to drive the chariot of the Sun, his father, through the heavens. But his unskilful hands frighten the steeds. The flaming chariot, thrown out of its course, approaches the terrestrial regions. The whole universe is on the verge of ruin when Jupiter strikes the imprudent Phaeton with his thunderbolt.\"  There is a solemn sense at first (_Maestoso_), a mid-air poise of the harmony, a quick spring of resolution and--on through the heavens. At the outset and always is the pervading musical charm. In the beginning is the enchantment of mere motion in lightest prancing strings and harp with slowly ascending curve. In farther journey comes a spring of the higher wood and soon a firm note of horns and a blast of trumpets on a chirruping call, till the whole panoply of solar brilliance is shimmering. Now with the continuing pulse (of saltant strings) rings a buoyant,  [Music: _Allegro animato_ (Violins) _Marcato_ (Trumpets and trombones)]  regnant air in the brass. A (canon) chase of echoing voices merely adds an entrancing bewilderment, then yields to other symbols and visions.  Still rises the thread of pulsing strings to higher empyraean and then floats forth in golden horns, as we hang in the heavens, a melody tenderly solemn, as of pent delight, or perhaps of a more fatal hue, with the solar orb encircled by his satellites.  Still on to a higher pole spins the dizzy path; then at the top of the song, it turns in slow descending curve. Almost to Avernus seems the gliding fall when the first melody rings anew. But there is now an anxious sense that dims the joy of motion and in the  [Music: (With trembling of violins in high B flat) (Horns)]  returning first motive jars the buoyant spring. Through the maze of fugue with tinge of terror presses the fatuous chase, when--crash comes the shock of higher power. There is a pause of motion in the din and a downward flight as of lifeless figure.  Now seems the soul of the sweet melody to sing, in purest dirge, without the shimmer of attendant motion save a ghostly shadow of the joyous symbol.   _THE YOUTH OF HERCULES_  The \"Legend\" is printed in the score as follows:  \"Fable tells us that upon entering into life Hercules "]]]
