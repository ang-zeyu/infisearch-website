Thus Varu@na and Sûrya are subordinate to Indra (I. 101), Varu@na and the As'vins submit to the power of Vi@s@nu (I. 156)....Even when a god is spoken of as unique or chief (_eka_), as is natural enough in laudations, such statements lose their temporarily monotheistic force, through the modifications or corrections supplied by the context or even by the same verse [Footnote Ref 3]. \"Henotheism is therefore an appearance,\" says Macdonell, \"rather than a reality, an appearance produced by the indefiniteness due to undeveloped anthropomorphism, by the lack of any Vedic god occupying the position of a Zeus as the constant head of the pantheon, by the natural tendency of the priest or singer in extolling a particular god to exaggerate his greatness and to ignore other gods, and by the  ____________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 27.]  [Footnote 2: See _Ibid._ p. 33. See also Arrowsmith's note on it for other references to Henotheism.]  [Footnote 3: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, pp. 16, 17.]  19  growing belief in the unity of the gods (cf. the refrain of 3, 35) each of whom might be regarded as a type of the divine [Footnote ref 1].\" But whether we call it Henotheism or the mere temporary exaggeration of the powers of the deity in question, it is evident that this stage can neither be properly called polytheistic nor monotheistic, but one which had a tendency towards them both, although it was not sufficiently developed to be identified with either of them. The tendency towards extreme exaggeration could be called a monotheistic bias in germ, whereas the correlation of different deities as independent of one another and yet existing side by side was a tendency towards polytheism.  Growth of a Monotheistic tendency; Prajâpati, Vis'vakarma.  This tendency towards extolling a god as the greatest and highest gradually brought forth the conception of a supreme Lord of all beings (Prajâpati), not by a process of conscious generalization but as a necessary stage of development of the mind, able to imagine a deity as the repository of the highest moral and physical power, though its direct manifestation cannot be perceived. Thus the epithet Prajâpati or the Lord of beings, which was originally an epithet for other deities, came to be recognized as a separate deity, the highest and the greatest. Thus it is said in R.V.x. 121 [Footnote Ref 2]:    In the beginning rose Hira@nyagarbha,   Born as the only lord of all existence.   This earth he settled firm and heaven established:   What god shall we adore with our oblations?   Who gives us breath, who gives us strength, whose bidding   All creatures must obey, the bright gods even;   Whose shade is death, whose shadow life immortal:   What god shall we adore with our oblations?   Who by his might alone became the monarch   Of all that breathes, of all that wakes or slumbers,   Of all, both man and beast, the lord eternal:   What god shall we adore with our oblations?   Whose might and majesty these snowy mountains,   The ocean and the distant stream exhibit;   Whose arms extended are these spreading regions:   What god shall we adore with our oblations?   Who made the heavens bright, the earth enduring,   Who fixed the firmament, the heaven of heavens;   Who measured out the air's extended spaces:   What god shall we adore with our oblations?  _________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 17.]  [Footnote 2: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, pp. 88, 89.]  20  Similar attributes are also ascribed to the deity Vis'vakarma (All-creator) [Footnote ref 1]. He is said to be father and procreator of all beings, though himself uncreated. He generated the primitive waters. It is to him that the sage says,    Who is our father, our creator, maker,   Who every place doth know and every creature,   By whom alone to gods their names were given,   To him all other creatures go to ask him [Footnote ref 2]                                           R.V.x.82.3.   Brahma.  The conception of Brahman which has been the highest glory for the Vedânta philosophy of later days had hardly emerged in the @Rg-Veda from the associations of the sacrificial mind. The meanings that Sâya@na the celebrated commentator of the Vedas gives of the word as collected by Haug are: (_a_) food, food offering, (_b_) the chant of the sâma-singer, (_c_) magical formula or text, (_d_) duly completed ceremonies, (_e_) the chant and sacrificial gift together, (_f_) the recitation of the hot@r priest, (_g_) great. Roth says that it also means \"the devotion which manifests itself as longing and satisfaction of the soul and reaches forth to the gods.\" But it is only in the S'atapatha Brâhma@na that the conception of Brahman has acquired a great significance as the supreme principle which is the moving force behind the gods. Thus the S'atapatha says, \"Verily in the beginning this (universe) was the Brahman (neut.). It created the gods; and, having created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this (terrestrial) world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky.... Then the Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone up to the sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again into these worlds?' It then descended again by means of these two, Form and Name. Whatever has a name, that is name; and that again which has no name and which one knows by its form, 'this is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there are Form and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe). These indeed are the two great forces of Brahman; and, verily, he who knows these two great forces of Brahman becomes himself a great force [Footnote ref 3]. In another place Brahman is said to be the ultimate thing in the Universe and is identified with Prajâpati, Puru@sa and Prâ@na  __________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: See _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 89, and also Muir's _Sanskrit Texts_, vol. IV. pp. 5-11.]  [Footnote 2: Kaegi's translation.]  [Footnote 3: See Eggeling's translation of S'atapatha Brâhmana _S.B.E._ vol. XLIV. pp. 27, 28.]  21  (the vital air [Footnote ref 1]). In another place Brahman is described as being the Svayambhû (self-born) performing austerities, who offered his own self in the creatures and the creatures in his own self, and thus compassed supremacy, sovereignty and lordship over all creatures [Footnote ref 2]. The conception of the supreme man (Puru@sa) in the @Rg-Veda also supposes that the supreme man pervades the world with only a fourth part of Himself, whereas the remaining three parts transcend to a region beyond. He is at once the present, past and future [Footnote ref 3].   Sacrifice; the First Rudiments of the Law of Karma.  It will however be wrong to suppose that these monotheistic tendencies were gradually supplanting the polytheistic sacrifices. On the other hand, the complications of ritualism were gradually growing in their elaborate details. The direct result of this growth contributed however to relegate the gods to a relatively unimportant position, and to raise the dignity of the magical characteristics of the sacrifice as an institution which could give the desired fruits of themselves. The offerings at a sacrifice were not dictated by a devotion with which we are familiar under Christian or Vai@s@nava influence. The sacrifice taken as a whole is conceived as Haug notes \"to be a kind of machinery in which every piece must tally with the other,\" the slightest discrepancy in the performance of even a minute ritualistic detail, say in the pouring of the melted butter on the fire, or the proper placing of utensils employed in the sacrifice, or even the misplacing of a mere straw contrary to the injunctions was sufficient to spoil the whole sacrifice with whatsoever earnestness it might be performed. Even if a word was mispronounced the most dreadful results might follow. Thus when Tva@s@t@r performed a sacrifice for the production of a demon who would be able to kill his enemy Indra, owing to the mistaken accent of a single word the object was reversed and the demon produced was killed by Indra. But if the sacrifice could be duly performed down to the minutest detail, there was no power which could arrest or delay the fruition of the object. Thus the objects of a sacrifice were fulfilled not by the grace of the gods, but as a natural result of the sacrifice. The performance of the rituals invariably produced certain mystic or magical results by virtue of which the object desired  ___________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: See _S.B.E._ XLIII. pp.59,60,400 and XLIV. p.409.]  [Footnote 2: See _Ibid_., XLIV, p. 418.]  [Footnote 3: R.V.x.90, Puru@sa Sûkta.]  22  by the sacrificer was fulfilled in due course like the fulfilment of a natural law in the physical world. The sacrifice was believed to have existed from eternity like the Vedas. The creation of the world itself was even regarded as the fruit of a sacrifice performed by the supreme Being. It exists as Haug says \"as an invisible thing at all times and is like the latent power of electricity in an electrifying machine, requiring only the operation of a suitable apparatus in order to be elicited.\" The sacrifice is not offered to a god with a view to propitiate him or to obtain from him welfare on earth or bliss in Heaven; these rewards are directly produced by the sacrifice itself through the correct performance of complicated and interconnected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],["title","A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#8)"],["body","which constitute the sacrifice. Though in each sacrifice certain gods were invoked and received the offerings, the gods themselves were but instruments in bringing about the sacrifice or in completing the course of mystical ceremonies composing it. Sacrifice is thus regarded as possessing a mystical potency superior even to the gods, who it is sometimes stated attained to their divine rank by means of sacrifice. Sacrifice was regarded as almost the only kind of duty, and it was also called _karma_ or _kriyâ_ (action) and the unalterable law was, that these mystical ceremonies for good or for bad, moral or immoral (for there were many kinds of sacrifices which were performed for injuring one's enemies or gaining worldly prosperity or supremacy at the cost of others) were destined to produce their effects. It is well to note here that the first recognition of a cosmic order or law prevailing in nature under the guardianship of the highest gods is to be found in the use of the word @Rta (literally the course of things). This word was also used, as Macdonell observes, to denote the \"'order' in the moral world as truth and 'right' and in the religious world as sacrifice or 'rite'[Footnote ref 1]\" and its unalterable law of producing effects. It is interesting to note in this connection that it is here that we find the first germs of the law of karma, which exercises such a dominating control over Indian thought up to the present day. Thus we find the simple faith and devotion of the Vedic hymns on one hand being supplanted by the growth of a complex system of sacrificial rites, and on the other bending their course towards a monotheistic or philosophic knowledge of the ultimate reality of the universe.  ____________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 11.]  23   Cosmogony--Mythological and philosophical.  The cosmogony of the @Rg-Veda may be looked at from two aspects, the mythological and the philosophical. The mythological aspect has in general two currents, as Professor Macdonell says, \"The one regards the universe as the result of mechanical production, the work of carpenter's and joiner's skill; the other represents it as the result of natural generation [Footnote ref. 1].\" Thus in the @Rg-Veda we find that the poet in one place says, \"what was the wood and what was the tree out of which they built heaven and earth [Footnote ref. 2]?\" The answer given to this question in Taittirîya-Brâhma@na is \"Brahman the wood and Brahman the tree from which the heaven and earth were made [Footnote ref 3].\" Heaven and Earth are sometimes described as having been supported with posts [Footnote ref 4]. They are also sometimes spoken of as universal parents, and parentage is sometimes attributed to Aditi and Dak@sa.  Under this philosophical aspect the semi-pantheistic Man-hymn [Footnote ref 5] attracts our notice. The supreme man as we have already noticed above is there said to be the whole universe, whatever has been and shall be; he is the lord of immortality who has become diffused everywhere among things animate and inanimate, and all beings came out of him; from his navel came the atmosphere; from his head arose the sky; from his feet came the earth; from his ear the four quarters. Again there are other hymns in which the Sun is called the soul (_âtman_) of all that is movable and all that is immovable [Footnote ref 6]. There are also statements to the effect that the Being is one, though it is called by many names by the sages [Footnote ref 7]. The supreme being is sometimes extolled as the supreme Lord of the world called the golden egg (Hira@nyagarbha [Footnote ref 8]). In some passages it is said \"Brahma@naspati blew forth these births like a blacksmith. In the earliest age of the gods, the existent sprang from the non-existent. In the first age of the gods, the existent sprang from the non-existent: thereafter the regions sprang, thereafter, from Uttânapada [Footnote ref 9].\" The most remarkable and sublime hymn in which the first germs of philosophic speculation  ___________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p. 11.]  [Footnote 2: R.V.x. 81. 4.]  [Footnote 3: Taitt.

II. 15 and IV. 56.]  [Footnote 5: R.V.x. 90.]  [Footnote 6: R.V.I. 115.]  [Footnote 7: R.V.I. 164. 46.]  [Footnote 8: R.V.X. 121.]  [Footnote 9: Muir's translation of R.V.x. 72; Muir's _Sanskrit Texts_, vol. v.p. 48.]  24  with regard to the wonderful mystery of the origin of the world are found is the 129th hymn of R.V.x.  1. Then there was neither being nor not-being.    The atmosphere was not, nor sky above it.    What covered all? and where? by what protected?    Was there the fathomless abyss of waters?  2. Then neither death nor deathless existed;    Of day and night there was yet no distinction.    Alone that one breathed calmly, self-supported,    Other than It was none, nor aught above It.  3. Darkness there was at first in darkness hidden;    The universe was undistinguished water.    That which in void and emptiness lay hidden    Alone by power of fervor was developed.  4. Then for the first time there arose desire,    Which was the primal germ of mind, within it.    And sages, searching in their heart, discovered    In Nothing the connecting bond of Being.  6. Who is it knows? Who here can tell us surely    From what and how this universe has risen?    And whether not till after it the gods lived?    Who then can know from what it has arisen?  7. The source from which this universe has risen,    And whether it was made, or uncreated,    He only knows, who from the highest heaven    Rules, the all-seeing lord--or does not He know [Footnote ref 1]?  The earliest commentary on this is probably a passage in the S'atapatha Brâhma@na (x. 5. 3.I) which says that \"in the beginning this (universe) was as it were neither non-existent nor existent; in the beginning this (universe) was as it were, existed and did not exist: there was then only that Mind. Wherefore it has been declared by the Rishi (@Rg-Veda X. 129. I), 'There was then neither the non-existent nor the existent' for Mind was, as it were, neither existent nor non-existent. This Mind when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self (a body); it practised austerity: it acquired consistency [Footnote ref 2].\" In the Atharva-Veda also we find it stated that all forms of the universe were comprehended within the god Skambha [Footnote ref 3].  Thus we find that even in the period of the Vedas there sprang forth such a philosophic yearning, at least among some who could  ____________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 90. R.V.x. 129.]  [Footnote 2: See Eggeling's translation of _S'.B., S.B.E._ vol. XLIII. pp. 374, 375.]  [Footnote 3: _A.V._ x. 7. 10.]  25  question whether this universe was at all a creation or not, which could think of the origin of the world as being enveloped in the mystery of a primal non-differentiation of being and non-being; and which could think that it was the primal One which by its inherent fervour gave rise to the desire of a creation as the first manifestation of the germ of mind, from which the universe sprang forth through a series of mysterious gradual processes. In the Brâhma@nas, however, we find that the cosmogonic view generally requires the agency of a creator, who is not however always the starting point, and we find that the theory of evolution is combined with the theory of creation, so that Prajâpati is sometimes spoken of as the creator while at other times the creator is said to have floated in the primeval water as a cosmic golden egg.   Eschatology; the Doctrine of Âtman.  There seems to be a belief in the Vedas that the soul could be separated from the body in states of swoon, and that it could exist after death, though we do not find there any trace of the doctrine of transmigration in a developed form. In the S'atapatha Brâhma@na it is said that those who do not perform rites with correct knowledge are born again after death and suffer death again. In a hymn of the @Rg-Veda (X. 58) the soul (_manas_) of a man apparently unconscious is invited to come back to him from the trees, herbs, the sky, the sun, etc. In many of the hymns there is also the belief in the existence of another world, where the highest material joys are attained as a result of the performance of the sacrifices and also in a hell of darkness underneath where the evil-doers are punished. In the S'atapatha Brâhma@na we find that the dead pass between two fires which burn the evil-doers, but let the good go by [Footnote ref 1]; it is also said there that everyone is born again after death, is weighed in a balance, and receives reward or punishment according as his works are good or bad. It is easy to see that scattered ideas like these with regard to the destiny of the soul of man according to the sacrifice that he performs or other good or bad deeds form the first rudiments of the later doctrine of metempsychosis. The idea that man enjoys or suffers, either in another world or by being born in this world according to his good or bad deeds, is the first beginning of the moral idea, though in the Brahmanic days the good deeds were  _____________________________________________________________________  [Footnote 1: See _S.B._ I. 9.3, and also Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, pp. 166, 167.]  26  more often of the nature of sacrificial duties than ordinary good works. These ideas of the possibilities of a necessary connection of the enjoyments and sorrows of a man with his good and bad works when combined with the notion of an inviolable law or order, which we have already seen was gradually growing with the conception of @rta, and the unalterable law which"]]]
