But to sailors o’ the South that easy way was barred. To some, dame, believe (and I speak o’ what I know), Wormwood the trial and the Uzzite’s black shard; And the faithfuller the heart, the crueller the throe. Duty? It pulled with more than one string, This way and that, and anyhow a sting. The flag and your kin, how be true unto both? If either plight ye keep, then ye break the other troth. But elect here they must, though the casuists were out; Decide—hurry up—and throttle every doubt.  Of all these thrills thrilled at keelson, and throes, Little felt the shoddyites a-toasting o’ their toes; In mart and bazar Lucre chuckled the huzza, Coining the dollars in the bloody mint of war.  But in men, gray knights o’ the Order o’ Scars, And brave boys bound by vows unto Mars, Nature grappled honor, intertwisting in the strife:— But some cut the knot with a thoroughgoing knife. For how when the drums beat? How in the fray In Hampton Roads on the fine balmy day?  There a lull, wife, befell—drop o’ silent in the din. Let us enter that silence ere the belchings re-begin. Through a ragged rift aslant in the cannonade’s smoke An iron-clad reveals her repellent broadside Bodily intact. But a frigate, all oak, Shows honeycombed by shot, and her deck crimson-dyed. And a trumpet from port of the iron-clad hails, Summoning the other, whose flag never trails: “Surrender that frigate, Will! Surrender, Or I will sink her—_ram_, and end her!”  ’T was Hal. And Will, from the naked heart-o’-oak, Will, the old messmate, minus trumpet, spoke, Informally intrepid,—“Sink her, and be damned!”*  [* Historic.] Enough. Gathering way, the iron-clad _rammed_. The frigate, heeling over, on the wave threw a dusk. Not sharing in the slant, the clapper of her bell The fixed metal struck—uinvoked struck the knell Of the _Cumberland_ stillettoed by the _Merrimac’s_ tusk; While, broken in the wound underneath the gun-deck, Like a sword-fish’s blade in leviathan waylaid, The tusk was left infixed in the fast-foundering wreck. There, dungeoned in the cockpit, the wounded go down, And the chaplain with them. But the surges uplift The prone dead from deck, and for moment they drift Washed with the swimmers, and the spent swimmers drown. Nine fathom did she sink,—erect, though hid from light Save her colors unsurrendered and spars that kept the height.  Nay, pardon, old aunty! Wife, never let it fall, That big started tear that hovers on the brim; I forgot about your nephew and the _Merrimac’s_ ball; No more then of her, since it summons up him. But talk o’ fellows’ hearts in the wine’s genial cup:— Trap them in the fate, jam them in the strait, Guns speak their hearts then, and speak right up. The troublous colic o’ intestine war It sets the bowels o’ affection ajar. But, lord, old dame, so spins the whizzing world, A humming-top, ay, for the little boy-gods Flogging it well with their smart little rods, Tittering at time and the coil uncurled.  Now, now, sweetheart, you sidle away, No, never you like _that_ kind o’ _gay;_ But sour if I get, giving truth her due, Honey-sweet forever, wife, will Dick be to you!  But avast with the War! ‘Why recall racking days Since set up anew are the slip’s started stays? Nor less, though the gale we have left behind, Well may the heave o’ the sea remind. It irks me now, as it troubled me then, To think o’ the fate in the madness o’ men. If Dick was with Farragut on the night-river, When the boom-chain we burst in the fire-raft’s glare, That blood-dyed the visage as red as the liver; In the _Battle for the Bay_ too if Dick had a share, And saw one aloft a-piloting the war— Trumpet in the whirlwind, a Providence in place— Our Admiral old whom the captains huzza, Dick joys in the man nor brags about the race.  But better, wife, I like to booze on the days Ere the Old Order foundered in these very frays, And tradition was lost and we learned strange ways. Often I think on the brave cruises then; Re-sailing them in memory, I hail the press o’ men On the gunned promenade where rolling they go, Ere the dog-watch expire and break up the show. The Laced Caps I see between forward guns; Away from the powder-room they puff the cigar; “Three days more, hey, the donnas and the dons!” “Your Zeres widow, will you hunt her up, Starr?” The Laced Caps laugh, and the bright waves too; Very jolly, very wicked, both sea and crew, Nor heaven looks sour on either, I guess, Nor Pecksniff he bosses the gods’ high mess. Wistful ye peer, wife, concerned for my head, And how best to get me betimes to my bed.  But king o’ the club, the gayest golden spark, Sailor o’ sailors, what sailor do I mark? Tom Tight, Tom Tight, no fine fellow finer, A cutwater nose, ay, a spirited soul; But, bowsing away at the well-brewed bowl, He never bowled back from that last voyage to China.  Tom was lieutenant in the brig-o’-war famed When an officer was hung for an arch-mutineer, But a mystery cleaved, and the captain was blamed, And a rumpus too raised, though his honor it was clear. And Tom he would say, when the mousers would try him, And with cup after cup o’ Burgundy ply him: “Gentlemen, in vain with your wassail you beset, For the more I tipple, the tighter do I get.” No blabber, no, not even with the can— True to himself and loyal to his clan.  Tom blessed us starboard and d—d us larboard, Right down from rail to the streak o’ the garboard. Nor less, wife, we liked him.—Tom was a man In contrast queer with Chaplain Le Fan, Who blessed us at morn, and at night yet again, D—ning us only in decorous strain; Preaching ’tween the guns—each cutlass in its place— From text that averred old Adam a hard case. I see him—Tom—on _horse-block_ standing, Trumpet at mouth, thrown up all amain, An elephant’s bugle, vociferous demanding Of topmen aloft in the hurricane of rain, “Letting that sail there your faces flog? Manhandle it, men, and you’ll get the good grog!” O Tom, but he knew a blue-jacket’s ways, And how a lieutenant may genially haze; Only a sailor sailors heartily praise.  Wife, where be all these chaps, I wonder? Trumpets in the tempest, terrors in the fray, Boomed their commands along the deck like thunder; But silent is the sod, and thunder dies away. But Captain Turret, _“Old Hemlock”_ tall, (A leaning tower when his tank brimmed all,) Manoeuvre out alive from the war did he? Or, too old for that, drift under the lee? Kentuckian colossal, who, touching at Madeira, The huge puncheon shipped o’ prime _Santa-Clara;_ Then rocked along the deck so solemnly! No whit the less though judicious was enough In dealing with the Finn who made the great huff; Our three-decker’s giant, a grand boatswain’s mate, Manliest of men in his own natural senses; But driven stark mad by the devil’s drugged stuff, Storming all aboard from his run-ashore late, Challenging to battle, vouchsafing no pretenses, A reeling King Ogg, delirious in power, The quarter-deck carronades he seemed to make cower. “Put him in _brig_ there!” said Lieutenant Marrot. “Put him in _brig!_” back he mocked like a parrot; “Try it, then!” swaying a fist like Thor’s sledge, And making the pigmy constables hedge— Ship’s corporals and the master-at-arms. “In _brig_ there, I say!”—They dally no more; Like hounds let slip on a desperate boar, Together they pounce on the formidable Finn, Pinion and cripple and hustle him in. Anon, under sentry, between twin guns, He slides off in drowse, and the long night runs.  Morning brings a summons. Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain’s four aids; Trilled down the hatchways along the dusk halls: _Muster to the Scourge!_—Dawn of doom and its blast! As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship’s nether shades.  Keeping in the background and taking small part, Lounging at their ease, indifferent in face, Behold the trim marines uncompromised in heart; Their Major, buttoned up, near the staff finds room— The staff o’ lieutenants standing grouped in their place. All the Laced Caps o’ the ward-room come, The Chaplain among them, disciplined and dumb. The blue-nosed boatswain, complexioned like slag, Like a blue Monday lours—his implements in bag. Executioners, his aids, a couple by him stand, At a nod there the thongs to receive from his hand. Never venturing a caveat whatever may betide, Though functionally here on humanity’s side, The grave Surgeon shows, like the formal physician Attending the rack o’ the Spanish Inquisition.  The angel o’ the “brig” brings his prisoner up; Then, steadied by his old _Santa-Clara_, a sup, Heading all erect, the ranged assizes there, Lo, Captain Turret, and under starred bunting, (A florid full face and fine silvered hair,) Gigantic the yet greater giant confronting.  Now the culprit he liked, as a tall captain can A Titan subordinate and true _sailor-man;_ And frequent he’d shown it—no worded advance, But flattering the Finn with a well-timed glance. But what of that now? In the martinet-mien Read the _Articles of War_, heed the naval routine; While, cut to the heart a dishonor there to win, Restored to his senses, stood the Anak Finn; In racked self-control the squeezed tears peeping, Scalding the eye with repressed inkeeping. Discipline must be; the scourge is deemed due. But ah for the sickening and strange heart- benumbing, Compassionate abasement in shipmates that view; Such a grand champion shamed there succumbing! “Brown, tie him up.”—The cord he brooked: How else?—his arms spread apart—never threaping; No, never he flinched, never sideways he looked, Peeled to the waistband, the marble flesh creeping, Lashed by the sleet the officious winds urge.  In function his fellows their fellowship merge— The twain standing nigh—the two boatswain’s mates,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12841"],["title","John Marr and Other Poems (#2)"],["body","of his grade, ay, and brothers of his mess. With sharp thongs adroop the junior one awaits The word to uplift.           “Untie him—so! Submission is enough, Man, you may go.” Then, promenading aft, brushing fat Purser Smart, “Flog? Never meant it—hadn’t any heart. Degrade that tall fellow? “—Such, wife, was he, Old Captain Turret, who the brave wine could stow. Magnanimous, you think?—But what does Dick see? Apron to your eye! Why, never fell a blow; Cheer up, old wifie, ’t was a long time ago.  But where’s that sore one, crabbed and-severe, Lieutenant Lon Lumbago, an arch scrutineer? Call the roll to-day, would he answer—_Here!_ When the _Blixum’s_ fellows to quarters mustered How he’d lurch along the lane of gun-crews clustered, Testy as touchwood, to pry and to peer. Jerking his sword underneath larboard arm, He ground his worn grinders to keep himself calm. Composed in his nerves, from the fidgets set free, Tell, Sweet Wrinkles, alive now is he, In Paradise a parlor where the even tempers be?  Where’s Commander All-a-Tanto? Where’s Orlop Bob singing up from below? Where’s Rhyming Ned? has he spun his last canto? Where’s Jewsharp Jim? Where’s Ringadoon Joe? Ah, for the music over and done, The band all dismissed save the droned trombone! Where’s Glenn o’ the gun-room, who loved Hot-Scotch— Glen, prompt and cool in a perilous watch? Where’s flaxen-haired Phil? a gray lieutenant? Or rubicund, flying a dignified pennant?  But where sleeps his brother?—the cruise it was o’er, But ah, for death’s grip that welcomed him ashore! Where’s Sid, the cadet, so frank in his brag, Whose toast was audacious—“_Here’s Sid, and Sid’s flag!_” Like holiday-craft that have sunk unknown, May a lark of a lad go lonely down? Who takes the census under the sea? Can others like old ensigns be, Bunting I hoisted to flutter at the gaff— Rags in end that once were flags Gallant streaming from the staff?  Such scurvy doom could the chances deal To Top-Gallant Harry and Jack Genteel? Lo, Genteel Jack in hurricane weather, Shagged like a bear, like a red lion roaring; But O, so fine in his chapeau and feather, In port to the ladies never once _jawing;_ All bland _politesse,_ how urbane was he— _“Oui, mademoiselle”—“Ma chère amie!”_  ’T was Jack got up the ball at Naples, Gay in the old _Ohio_ glorious; His hair was curled by the berth-deck barber, Never you’d deemed him a cub of rude Boreas; In tight little pumps, with the grand dames in rout, A-flinging his shapely foot all about; His watch-chain with love’s jeweled tokens abounding, Curls ambrosial shaking out odors, Waltzing along the batteries, astounding The gunner glum and the grim-visaged loaders.  Wife, where be all these blades, I wonder, Pennoned fine fellows, so strong, so gay? Never their colors with a dip dived under; Have they hauled them down in a lack-lustre day, Or beached their boats in the Far, Far Away? Hither and thither, blown wide asunder, Where’s this fleet, I wonder and wonder. Slipt their cables, rattled their adieu, (Whereaway pointing? to what rendezvous?) Out of sight, out of mind, like the crack _Constitution,_ And many a keel time never shall renew— _Bon Homme Dick_ o’ the buff Revolution, The _Black Cockade_ and the staunch _True-Blue._  Doff hats to Decatur! But where is his blazon? Must merited fame endure time’s wrong— Glory’s ripe grape wizen up to a raisin? Yes! for Nature teems, and the years are strong, And who can keep the tally o’ the names that fleet along!  But his frigate, wife, his bride? Would blacksmiths brown Into smithereens smite the solid old renown? Rivetting the bolts in the iron-clad’s shell, Hark to the hammers with _a rat-tat-tat;_ “Handier a _derby_ than a laced cocked hat! The _Monitor_ was ugly, but she served us right well, Better than the _Cumberland,_ a beauty and the belle.”  _Better than the Cumberland!_—Heart alive in me! That battlemented hull, Tantallon o’ the sea, Kicked in, as at Boston the taxed chests o’ tea! Ay, spurned by the _ram,_ once a tall, shapely craft, But lopped by the Rebs to an iron-beaked raft— A blacksmith’s unicorn in armor _cap-a-pie_.  Under the water-line a _ram’s_ blow is dealt: And foul fall the knuckles that strike below the belt. Nor brave the inventions that serve to replace The openness of valor while dismantling the grace.  Aloof from all this and the never-ending game, Tantamount to teetering, plot and counterplot; Impenetrable armor—all-perforating shot; Aloof, bless God, ride the war-ships of old, A grand fleet moored in the roadstead of fame; Not submarine sneaks with _them_ are enrolled; Their long shadows dwarf us, their flags are as flame.  Don’t fidget so, wife; an old man’s passion Amounts to no more than this smoke that I puff; There, there, now, buss me in good old fashion; A died-down candle will flicker in the snuff.  But one last thing let your old babbler say, What Decatur’s coxswain said who was long ago hearsed, “Take in your flying-kites, for there comes a lubber’s day When gallant things will go, and the three-deckers first.”  My pipe is smoked out, and the grog runs slack; But bowse away, wife, at your blessed Bohea; This empty can here must needs solace me— Nay, sweetheart, nay; I take that back; Dick drinks from your eyes and he finds no lack!     TOM DEADLIGHT   During a tempest encountered homeward-bound from the Mediterranean, a grizzled petty-officer, one of the two captains of the forecastle, dying at night in his hammock, swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks of the British _Dreadnaught, 98,_ wandering in his mind, though with glimpses of sanity, and starting up at whiles, sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to two messmates, his watchers, one of whom fans the fevered tar with the flap of his old sou’wester. Some names and phrases, with here and there a line, or part of one; these, in his aberration, wrested into incoherency from their original connection and import, he voluntarily derives, as he does the measure, from a famous old sea-ditty, whose cadences, long rife, and now humming in the collapsing brain, attune the last flutterings of distempered thought.  Farewell and adieu to you noble hearties,—     Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain, For I’ve received orders for to sail for the Deadman,     But hope with the grand fleet to see you again.  I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail aback, boys;     I have hove my ship to, for the strike soundings clear— The black scud a’flying; but, by God’s blessing, dam’ me,     Right up the Channel for the Deadman I’ll steer.  I have worried through the waters that are called the Doldrums,     And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye grope— Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the mist, lads:—     _Flying Dutchman_—odds bobbs—off the Cape of Good Hope!  But what’s this I feel that is fanning my cheek, Matt?     The white goney’s wing?—how she rolls!— ’t is the Cape!— Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is mine, none;     And tell _Holy Joe_ to avast with the crape.  Dead reckoning, says _Joe_, it won’t do to go by;     But they doused all the glims, Matt, in sky t’ other night. Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the Deadman;     And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon near right.  The signal!—it streams for the grand fleet to anchor.     The captains—the trumpets—the hullabaloo! Stand by for blue-blazes, and mind your shank-painters,     For the Lord High Admiral, he’s squinting at you!  But give me my _tot_, Matt, before I roll over;     Jock, let’s have your flipper, it’s good for to feel; And don’t sew me up without _baccy_ in mouth, boys,     And don’t blubber like lubbers when I turn up my keel.     JACK ROY   Kept up by relays of generations young Never dies at halyards the blithe chorus sung; While in sands, sounds, and seas where the storm-petrels cry, Dropped mute around the globe, these halyard singers lie. Short-lived the clippers for racing-cups that run, And speeds in life’s career many a lavish mother’s-son.  But thou, manly king o’ the old _Splendid’s_ crew, The ribbons o’ thy hat still a-fluttering, should fly— A challenge, and forever, nor the bravery should rue. Only in a tussle for the starry flag high, When ’tis piety to do, and privilege to die. Then, only then, would heaven think to lop Such a cedar as the captain o’ the _Splendid’s_ main-top: A belted sea-gentleman; a gallant, off-hand Mercutio indifferent in life’s gay command. Magnanimous in humor; when the splintering shot fell, “Tooth-picks a-plenty, lads; thank ’em with a shell!”  Sang Larry o’ the _Cannakin,_ smuggler o’ the wine, At mess between guns, lad in jovial recline: “In Limbo our Jack he would chirrup up a cheer, The martinet there find a chaffing mutineer; From a thousand fathoms down under hatches o’ your Hades, He’d ascend in love-ditty, kissing fingers to your ladies!”  Never relishing the knave, though allowing for the menial, Nor overmuch the king, Jack, nor prodigally genial. Ashore on liberty he flashed in escapade, Vaulting over life in its levelness of grade, Like the dolphin off Africa in rainbow a-sweeping— Arch iridescent shot from seas languid sleeping.  Larking with thy life, if a joy but a toy, Heroic in thy levity wert thou, Jack Roy.     SEA PIECES     THE HAGLETS   By chapel bare, with walls sea-beat The lichened urns in wilds are lost About a carved memorial stone That shows, decayed and coral-mossed, A form recumbent, swords at feet, Trophies at head, and kelp for a winding-sheet.  I invoke thy ghost, neglected fane, Washed by the waters’ long lament; I adjure the recumbent effigy To tell the cenotaph’s intent— Reveal why fagotted swords are at feet, Why trophies appear and weeds are the winding-sheet.  By open ports the Admiral sits, And shares repose with guns that tell Of power that smote the arm’d Plate Fleet Whose sinking flag-ship’s colors fell; But over the Admiral floats in light His squadron’s flag, the red-cross Flag of the White.
