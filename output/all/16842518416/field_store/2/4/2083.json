In the One Hundred and Tenth Psalm this Heir is sharing rule at God's right hand while waiting the subduing of all enemies. He is to be divine, a king, and more, a _priest_-king. Surrounded by a nation of volunteers full of youthful vigor He will gain a decisive victory over the head of the allied enemies, and yet be Himself undisturbed in the continual freshness of His vigor. And all this rests upon the unchanging oath of Jehovah.  David's immediate heir found his father's pen, and in the Seventy-second Psalm repeats, with his own variations, his father's vision of the coming greater Heir. While there is repetition of the kingdom being world-wide and unending, with all nations in subjection, the chief emphasis is put upon the blessing to that great majority--the poor. They are to be freed from all oppression, to have full justice done them, with plenty of food to eat, and increased length of life.  That David's expectation had thoroughly permeated his circle is shown in the joyous Forty-fifth Psalm, written by one of the court musicians. It addresses the coming One as more than human, having great beauty and graciousness, reigning in righteousness, victoriously, with a queen of great beauty, and a princely posterity for unending generations.    <u>A Full-length Picture in Colors.</u>   These are but the beginnings. It is in the prophetic books, the third of the groups, that the full picture with its brightest coloring is found. The picture is not only winsome beyond all comparison and glorious, but stupendous in its conception and its sweep. It is most notable that, as the flood-tide of the nation's prosperity ebbs from its highest mark, the vision to the prophetic eye of a coming glory grows steadily in brightness and in distinctness. As the great kings go, the great prophets come. It is to them we must turn for the full-length picture.  The one _continuous_ subject of the prophets is the coming King and kingdom and attendant events. Immediate historical events furnish the setting, but with a continual swinging to the coming future greatness. The yellow glory light of the coming day is never out of the prophetic sky. Its reflection is never out of the prophetic eye. Jeremiah is the one most absorbed in the boiling of the political pot of his own strenuous time, but even he at times lifts his head and gets such glimpses of the coming glory as make him mix some rose tincture with the jet black ink he uses.  The common thread running through the fabric of the prophetic books clear from Isaiah to Malachi is the phrase \"in that day.\" Sometimes it thickens into \"the day of the Lord,\" \"the great day of the Lord,\" \"Jehovah hath a great day,\" \"at that time.\" About this thread is woven in turn the whole series of stirring scenes and events that are to mark the coming time. Sometimes it is of local application; most times of the future time, and a few times the meaning slides from one to the other, touching both.  Over all of these pages is the shadow of _Somebody_ coming down the aisle of the ages, who is to be the world's Master. The figure of a man, large to gigantic size, majestic, yet kindly as well as kingly, looms out through these lines before the reader's face. The old idea of God Himself dwelling in the midst of the people, sharing their life, made familiar by Eden, by the flame-tipped mount and the glory-filled tent, comes out again. For this coming One is said to be God Himself. But more than that He is to be a man, and a _son_ of man; man bred of man. The blending of the two, God and man, is pointed to in the unprecedented thing of a pure virgin birth for this one. God and a pure maiden join themselves in His coming. He is to be of native Hebrew stock, in direct descent from the great David, and born in David's native village. Of course He is to be a king as was David, but unlike that ancestor, to be not only a king, but a priest, and a preacher and teacher.  The _kingdom_ he will set up will be like Himself in its blending of the human and divine. Its origin is not human, but divine. The _capital_ is to be Zion or Jerusalem. It will be marked by the glorious presence of God Himself visibly present to all eyes. The _characteristics_ of the kingdom are of peculiar attractiveness, at any time, to any people of this poor old blood-stained, gun-ploughed battle-field of an earth. The stronger traits that men commonly think of as desirable are combined with traits that have been reckoned by men of all generations as absurdly, unpractically idealistic.  There will be vengeance upon all enemies, who have been using Israel as a common football, and great victory. Yet, strangely, these will be gotten _without the use of violent force_, and will be followed by great peace. The kingdom is to be established in loving-kindness and marked to an unparalleled degree by a sense of right and justice to all. This feature is emphasized over and over again, with refreshing frequency to those so eager for such a revolutionary change in their affairs. Absolute gentle fairness and impartiality will decide all difficulties arising. Even the most friendless and the most obnoxious thing will be fairly judged.  That great universal majority, _the poor_, will be especially guarded and cared for. There will be no hungry people, nor cold, nor poorly clad; no unemployed, begging for a chance to earn a dry crust, and no workers fighting for a fair share of the fruit of their sweat-wet toil. But there are tenderer touches yet upon this canvas. Broken hearts will be healed up, prison doors unhung, broken family circles complete again. It is to be a time of great rejoicing by the common people. Yet all this will be brought about, not immediately, but gradually, following the natural law of growth; though the beginning will be marked by a great crisis, coming suddenly.  The effect upon Israel _nationally_ is to be tremendous, sweepingly reversing the conditions under which most of these predictions are made. Israel is to become a Spirit-baptized nation, wholly swayed by the Spirit of God, and that gracious sway never to be withdrawn. All judgments for her sins are removed and all impurity thoroughly cleansed away. Possession of their own land is assured. And the capital city is to become a _holy_ place from which, in common with the whole land, all impurity has been cleansed away. All weakness and disability are gone, and full freedom from the exactions of her former enemies to be enjoyed. Not only is Israel to be at peace with all nations, but, far more, is to have the _leadership_ of the nations of the earth, and leadership of the highest sort--in a world-wide spiritual movement, in the day when the Spirit of God is to be poured out upon all flesh.  This leadership is to be a glorious and absolute supremacy among all the nations of the earth. And yet this is not to be by man's method of conquest, but of their own earnest accord all nations will come a-running eagerly, voluntarily, with all their wealth and resources for the upbuilding and service of Israel. In that time the Hebrew capital Jerusalem will likewise be the capital of the earth.  No less radical and sweeping will be the changes in Israel _personally_, individually. The people are to be _made over new within_. The modern word for this sort of thing is regeneration. The old-fashioned word is a _new heart--a new spirit_. The change is to be at the _core_; a change of the sort. With this will come a marked spirit of devotion to God, and a peculiar open-mindedness to the truth. There will be an absence of all sickness and a decided increase in length of life and great increase in numbers. There will be no longer any disappointment in plans, and the _sense_ of _slavish fear_, which is universal, not only with all the race, but through all time, will be utterly absent. Israel is to be a nation of persons with thrilled hearts and radiant faces.    <u>Back to Eden.</u>   The effect upon _all the nations_ of the earth is a large part of the background of the picture. Through Israel's advancement under the new order, every other nation is to come back to God. The outpouring of the Spirit upon Israel is to be followed by an outpouring upon _all_ flesh. There are the two outpourings of God's Spirit in these old prophetic pages. This will be followed by a universal, voluntary coming to Israel for religious instruction. She becomes the teacher of the nations regarding God, until by and by the whole earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the only God. Her influence upon them for good will be as the heavy fertilizing eastern dews and the life-giving showers are to vegetation.  But further yet, Israel is to be the _only_ medium of God's blessing upon the nations--the only channel. Those refusing her leadership will, for lack of vital sap, die of dry rot. The wondrous blessing enjoyed by this central nation, the unhingeing of dungeon doors, the opening of blind eyes, the mellowing of all the hard conditions of life, the reign of simple, full justice to all, is to be shared with all the nations. Israel's peace with all nations is to become a universal peace between and among all nations.  But there's still more. There are to follow certain radical changes in the realm of _nature_. Splendid rivers of water are to flow through Jerusalem, necessitating changes in the formation of the land there. The fortress capital of the Jews strongly entrenched among the Judean hills is to become, as the world's metropolis, a mighty city, with rivers to float the earth's commerce. The light of the sun and moon will be greatly increased, and yet this greatly intensified light will become at Jerusalem a shadow cast by the greater light of the presence of God. A devout Hebrew would associate this back with the light of the Presence-cloud in the Arabian barrens.

Conclusion     CHAPTER I  DICK AT TRAINING CAMP   His jaw set firmly, his keen, fiery eyes roving over the group before him, the gray-haired colonel of infantry closed his remarks with these words:  \"Gentlemen, the task set for the officers of the United States Army is to produce, with the least possible delay, the finest fighting army in the world.  Our own personal task is to make this, the Ninety-ninth, the finest regiment of infantry in that army.  \"You have heard, at some length, what is expected of you.  Any officer present, of any grade, who does not feel equal to the requirements I have laid down will do well to seek a transfer to some other regiment or branch of the service, or to send in his resignation as a military officer.\"  Rising to their feet behind the long, uncovered pine board mess tables at which they had sat listening and taking notes, the eyes of the colonel's subordinate officers glistened with enthusiasm. Instead of showing any trace of dissent they greeted their commanding officer's words with a low murmur of approval that grew into a noisy demonstration, then turned into three rousing cheers.  \"And a tiger!\" shouted a young lieutenant, in a bull-like voice that was heard over the racket.  Colonel Cleaves, though he did not unbend much before the tumult, permitted a gleam of satisfaction to show itself in his fine, rugged features.  \"Good!\" he said quietly, in a firm voice.  \"I feel assured that we shall all pull together for the common weal and for the abiding glory of American arms.\"  Gathering up the papers that he had, during his speech, laid out on the table before him, the colonel stepped briskly down the central aisle of the mess-room.  As it was a confidential meeting of regimental officers, and no enlisted man was present, one of the second lieutenants succeeded in being first to reach the door. Throwing it open, he came smartly to attention, saluting as the commanding officer passed through the doorway.  Then the door closed.  \"Good!\" cried Captain Dick Prescott.  \"That was straight talk all the way through.\"  \"Hit the mark or leave the regiment!\" voiced Captain Greg Holmes enthusiastically.  \"Be a one hundred per cent. officer, or get out of the service!\" agreed another comrade.  The tumult had already died down.  The officers, from Lieutenant-Colonel Graves down to the newest \"shave-tail\" or second lieutenant, acted as by common impulse when they pivoted slowly about on their heels, glancing at each other with earnest smiles.  \"Gentlemen, our job has been cut out for us.  We know the price of success, and we know what failure would mean for us, personally or collectively.  Going over to quarters, Sands?\"  Thrusting a hand through the arm of Major Sands, Lieutenant-Colonel Graves started down the aisle.  Little groups followed, and the mess-room of that company barracks was speedily emptied.  Hard work, not age, had brought the gray frosting into the hair of Colonel Cleaves; he was forty-seven years old, and not many months before he had been only a major.  The time was early in September, in the year 1917.  War had been declared against Germany on April 6th.  In the middle of July the Ninety-o-ninth Infantry had been called into existence.  Regiments were then being added to the Regular Army.  Two or three hundred trained soldiers and several hundred recruits had made up the beginnings of the regiment.  Prescott and Holmes had been among the latest of the captains sent to the regiment, arriving in August. And now Colonel Cleaves had just joined his command on orders from Washington.  With forty men in the headquarters company and some fifty in the machine-gun company, the rifle companies on this September day averaged about seventy men.  Nor had a full complement of officers yet arrived.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, lately first lieutenants, as readers of former volumes of this series are aware, had received their commissions as captains just before joining the Ninety-ninth.  \"This regiment is scheduled to go over at an early date,\" Colonel Cleaves had informed his regimental officers, at the conference of which we have just witnessed the close.  \"Headquarters and machine-gun companies must be raised to their respective quotas of men, and each rifle company must be increased from seventy to two hundred and fifty men each.  New recruits will arrive every week.  These men must be whipped into shape.  Gentlemen, I expect your tireless aid in making this the finest infantry regiment in the American line.\"  One or two glances at Colonel Cleaves, when he was talking earnestly, were enough to show the observer that this officer meant all he said.  Shirkers, among either officers or men, would receive scant consideration in his regiment.  Camp Berry, at which the Ninety-ninth and the Hundredth were stationed, lay in one of the prettiest parts of Georgia.  Needless to say the day was one of sweltering heat and the regimental officers, as they filed out of the company barracks that had been used for holding the conference, fanned themselves busily with their campaign hats.  Each, however, as he struck the steps leading to the ground, placed his campaign hat squarely on his head.  \"Some pace the K.O. has set for us,\" murmured Greg, as he and Dick started to walk down the company street.  \"And we must keep that pace if we hope to last in Colonel Cleaves's regiment,\" Dick declared, with conviction.  \"Time was when an officer in the Regular Army could look forward to remaining an officer as long as he was physically fit and did not disgrace himself.  But in this war any officer, regular or otherwise, will find himself laid on the shelf whenever he fails to produce his full share of usefulness.\"  \"Do you think it's really as bad as that, Prescott?\" demanded Captain Cartwright, who was walking just behind them.  \"Worse!\" Dick replied dryly and briefly.  Cartwright sighed, then took a tighter grip on the swagger stick that he carried jauntily in his right hand.  Cartwright was a smart, soldierly looking chap, but was well known as an officer who was not addicted to hard work.  Past three or four barrack buildings on the street the chums walked, Cartwright still keeping just behind them.  \"Look at the work of Sergeant Mock, will you?\" demanded Greg, halting short as they came to the edge of one of the drill grounds.  Mock belonged to Greg's own company.  At this moment the sergeant was busy, or should have been, drilling what was supposed to be a platoon, though to-day it consisted of only two corporals' squads, or sixteen men in all.  Greg Holmes's eyes opened wide with disgust as he watched the drilling, unseen by the sergeant.  The platoon had just wheeled and marched off by fours.  The cadence was too slow, the men looked slouchy and showed no signs whatever of spirit.  \"Perhaps the sergeant isn't feeling well,\" remarked Dick, with a smile.  \"He won't be feeling well after he has talked with me,\" Greg uttered between his teeth.  To the further limit of the drill ground the sergeant marched his platoon, then wheeled them and brought them back again.  As he came about the sergeant caught sight of his company commander. In an undertone he gave an order that brought his men along at greater speed than they had gone.  \"Halt!\" ordered the sergeant, and brought up his hand in salute to the officers.  \"Sergeant Mock,\" called Holmes, in a low, even voice, \"turn the men over to a corporal and come here.\"  Hastily, and flushing, Sergeant Mock came forward.  \"How are the men feeling?\" Greg inquired, after signaling the corporal now in charge to continue the drilling.  \"Tired, sir,\" replied Mock, with a shamefaced look.  \"And how is the sergeant feeling?\" Greg went on, as the corporal led the men across the drill ground, this time at a sharper pace and correcting any fault in soldierly bearing that he observed.  \"All right, sir,\" replied the sergeant.  \"Then, if you're feeling all right, Sergeant Mock,\" Greg continued in as even a voice as before, \"explain to me why you were marching the platoon at a cadence of about ninety, instead of the regulation hundred and twenty steps per minute.  Tell me why the alignment of the fours was poor, and why the men were allowed to march without paying the slightest heed to their bearing.\"  Though there was nothing at all sharp in the company commander's voice, Mock knew that he was being \"called,\" and, in fact, was perilously close to being \"cussed out.\"  \"The---the day is hot, sir, and---and I knew the men were about played out,\" stammered Mock.  \"How long have you been in the Army, sergeant?\" Greg continued.  \"About two years and a half, sir.\"  \"In all that time did you ever know officers or enlisted men to be excused from full performance of ordered duty on account of the weather?\"  \"N-n-no, sir.\"  \"Then why did you start a new system on your own authority?\" Greg asked quietly.  Mock tried to answer, opened his mouth, in fact, and uttered a few incoherent sounds, which quickly died in his throat.  \"Sergeant Mock,\" said Greg, \"we have just heard from our"]]]
