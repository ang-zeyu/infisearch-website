But as the darkness made accurate shooting by the Germans impossible, so it made speed by the fugitives impossible also. They stumbled along as well as they could, now and then tripping over a fallen limb or tumbling into a hole. Tired and almost exhausted, they at length emerged into the open, and broke into a weary run.  \"We have got to get under cover of some kind before they reach the edge of the woods, or we are gone goslings,\" panted Hal.  Suddenly, in the darkness, they came upon another clump of trees, and as they stumbled into their shelter another volley rang out. One man groaned and stumbled. A comrade lent a supporting hand and dragged him into the woods.  \"We'll stop here a moment and pick off a few of 'em,\" said Hal grimly.  The Germans were now advancing across the open space. Lying upon the ground, the nine opened fire. They aimed carefully and not a shot was wasted, and so rapid was their fire that the Germans halted.  \"They don't know how many of us there are,\" said Hal, \"and they are afraid to take a chance. One more volley, men, and then up and run for it again.\"  A final volley was delivered with telling effect, and the English sprang to their feet and darted through the woods. The Germans gave them a parting shot, but there was no pursuit.  \"That was pretty close,\" said Chester.  \"It was, indeed,\" replied Hal, \"and there is one more of our men gone. Was anyone wounded?\" he asked, turning to the others.  \"Shot in the shoulder, sir,\" replied a man named Brown.  \"They got me in the arm,\" said another.  \"Anyone else?\" questioned Hal.  There was no reply, and Hal asked:  \"Are you two men able to go on without assistance?\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply.  \"Good! Then come on.\"  All night long the little party continued on their march, and it was not until the first gray streak of dawn showed them, in the distance, the first British line that the boys felt entirely safe.  Their report made, they were returning, later in the day, to their quarters to seek a much needed rest, when a well known voice exclaimed:  \"Well, boys, how are you?\"  The lads turned quickly about; then each gave a cry of delight and grabbed the man who had accosted them by the hand.  \"Captain Derevaux!\" they exclaimed in a single voice.  \"No,\" replied the gallant Frenchman, with a smile. \"Major Derevaux, if you please!\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE GERMAN RETREAT BEGUN.   Hal and Chester stood for some minutes grasping their friend by the hand.  \"Major, eh,\" ejaculated Hal. \"I'm glad to hear that!\"  \"So am I,\" declared Chester. \"I am sure no one deserved promotion more than you.\"  \"Thanks,\" laughed the major.  \"Tell us,\" said Hal, \"what are you doing here? I thought you were with the Southern army.\"  \"I am; but I carried dispatches to General French, and if I mistake not, they are important ones. I believe that plans have been brought to a head and that we shall take the offensive soon.\"  \"Good!\" cried Chester. \"We have been retreating long enough.\"  \"But,\" Hal protested, \"we can hardly advance in the face of such odds; we must have reinforcements.\"  \"Well,\" said Major Derevaux, \"strong reinforcements already are arriving, and I believe that the advance will be general along our whole line.\"  \"That will mean severe fighting,\" said Chester.  \"Indeed it will,\" replied the major. \"It will mean fighting such as the world has never heard of before. It will mean death for thousands upon thousands. But the Germans must be pushed back.\"  \"And the Kaiser will find that he is not to have things all his own way,\" said Hal.  \"Exactly,\" returned the major. \"But I must leave you now, boys. I must return to my own regiment at once. Good luck to you!\"  \"Good luck!\" exclaimed the boys as the major turned on his heel and strode rapidly away.  The two lads returned to their own quarters and gave themselves up to rest. So completely were they worn out that it was dark when they again opened their eyes; and they probably would not have done so then had not the clear notes of a bugle awakened them.  Rushing into the open, the lads saw that on all sides the troops were ready to move--whether forward or backward they could not tell as yet. It was evident, however, that something was afoot.  Hal and Chester made their way to the side of General French and joined the members of his staff. The gallant British commander was sitting his horse quietly, his staff grouped about him. Occasionally one went dashing away with some order, as the general gave a laconic command.  The boys had hardly taken their places when General French said quietly:  \"Order a general advance!\"  A moment later and the small though mighty host of Britain was in motion, and a loud cheer rang out on the still night air as the troops perceived that they were going forward--that the retreat had ended.  Swiftly and silently the army advanced. Ahead could be heard the crack, crack of rifle fire, indicating that the outposts were engaged with the enemy. Also, from the distance, could be heard the booming of the great German guns, and as the English advanced still further men began to fall before the deadly German artillery fire.  But the British did not falter; they plodded on as steadily as before. Then, after two hours of rapid marching, came the sudden command to halt. A moment later and a squadron of British cavalry came into view, retreating before a large force of Germans.  Just in front of the infantry the cavalry halted, and turned their faces toward the enemy. The advance of the British so far had not been discovered; but as the pursuing Germans came into view, the command to fire rang out.  There was a deafening crash as the British infantry hurled their messengers of death into the compact ranks of the foe; and under this deadly fire the British cavalry dashed forward. Before the Germans could recover from their surprise the English horsemen were upon them, striking, cutting, slashing.  It was deadly and terrible work and the English did not go unscathed. But struggling thus, hand to hand, the Germans were no match for the English. Now there came from behind the Germans a large force of infantry on the run, and before these reinforcements the British cavalry was forced to retire.  All this was happening right before the eyes of Hal and Chester, in the very center of the British line. On the right and left the engagement was of the same fierce kind, and the deafening crashes of rifles and artillery on either side gave conclusive evidence that the British were engaged with the enemy all along their entire front.  Still the German cavalry pursued the British cavalry in the center. Then General French turned suddenly to Hal:  \"Tell General Mayo to advance in force!\" he commanded.  The general turned to Chester:  \"Ask General Samson to bring his artillery into instant action!\"  The two lads dashed away on their respective missions; and almost immediately the results of these two commands were apparent.  As the German infantry advanced in the wake of their cavalry, the British came to sudden life. Flame burst out from all along the center and the Germans recoiled. Volley after volley was poured into the wavering ranks of the enemy, and they turned to flee.  A supporting column was rushed hurriedly to their assistance, and as they advanced the British artillery opened fire. Great holes were cut in the advancing German line, but their advance was unchecked. From their rear reinforcements were coming continually.  The fire of the British artillery and infantry was deadly. Men fell by the hundreds, were mowed down like chaff before the wind by the accuracy of the British fire. In the English ranks men also were dropping on all sides, but the gaps were filled up immediately and the British, singing and cheering, continued their advance.  The roar of battle could be heard for miles around, but the men engaged in the conflict were unconscious of it. They had but one sense left--that of sight--and their rifles continued to deal out death.  At length the German advance was checked, and then they began to fall back.  There was a rousing cheer from the English, and the advance was more rapid than before. The retreating Germans halted, turned to face the English, made a last desperate stand, then fled in disorder.  But as the English broke into a run to pursue their advantage still closer, they were met with a hail of bullets from a large force of the enemy's infantry which at that moment advanced, in support of their comrades, close enough to come into action.  The English reeled for a moment under this terrible fire, but they did not waver. Support was hurried to them. It was time for prompt action.  General French took in the situation at a glance and gave a quick command. A moment later the voices of the different officers rang out along the British line:  \"With the bayonet! Charge!\"     CHAPTER V.  THE CHARGE.   For the smallest fraction of a second there was an awesome silence, and then the British swept forward with a rush. Neither the bullets from the thousands of rifles nor the steady fire from the great guns of the German field batteries checked them.  The infantry covered the open space at a quick trot, and in almost less time than it takes to tell, it was at hand grips with the enemy, who stood braced to receive the shock of the charge.  The impact was terrific. The Germans stood gallantly to their work, encouraged by the shouts of their officers, but they were no match for the British troops in hand-to-hand fighting.  As the British closed upon them, the Germans poured in one fierce volley; but they had no time for more. Down went Teutons and English in struggling heaps, but the British poured over them and continued their deadly work.  All along the line the Germans gave ground slowly, their enemies pursuing them relentlessly and cutting them down as they retreated. The engagement became a slaughter.  Now Hal and Chester found themselves in the midst of the battle, in the fiercest of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12870"],["title","The Boy Allies on the Firing Line; Or, Twelve Days Battle Along the Marne (#3)"],["body","fighting. Sent forward with orders, they found themselves in the center of the sudden charge. Neither was minded to turn back, but they managed to single each other out and soon were fighting side by side. Blood streamed from a wound in Hal's cheek, where a German bayonet had pricked him slightly. Chester was unwounded.  Suddenly Hal found himself engaged with a German officer. With a swift move he swept aside his opponent's blade and felled him to the earth. At the same moment a tall German soldier, thinking to deprive the lad of his weapon, brought his rifle down upon Hal's sword.  But the boy's grip was firm and the sword snapped off near the hilt. Quickly Hal sprang forward, and before the German soldier could recover himself, the lad cut him down with his broken sword. Then, stooping, he picked up the sword which had fallen from the hands of the German officer, and sprang to the aid of Chester, who was fiercely engaged with two of the enemy, one an officer, the other a trooper.  One swift stroke of the boy's sword and the soldier was laid low. At the same instant Chester's sword slipped through his opponent's guard and the latter went to the ground, a deep wound in his side.  \"Good work!\" Chester found time to pant to Hal, and a second later both lads were once more too busy for speech.  Now Chester found himself engaged with a foeman worthy of his steel. The latter, a German lieutenant, was pressing the lad severely. At sword play the lad was clearly no match for him. Nevertheless Chester was giving a good account of himself.  Suddenly his sword was sent spinning from his hand, and as the weapon came down the point struck a German soldier squarely in the face. Chester's opponent sprang forward, his blade raised for a death thrust. But even as he thrust Chester dodged and the sword passed harmlessly over his head.  From his stooping position Chester seized the German officer by the knees before he could recover his balance and aim another thrust at him, and, with a quick heave, sent the officer spinning over his head. The German hit the ground with a thud, and as he was about to pick himself up an English trooper ended his fighting days with a thrust of his bayonet.  Chester seized the officer's sword and sprang forward into the thick of the conflict again. Side by side, Hal and Chester advanced with the victorious British troops, striking, cutting and slashing their way through the dense bodies of the enemy.  Suddenly Chester fell to the ground beneath the feet of the struggling men. A descending rifle butt had struck him a glancing blow on the head. Hal, engaged at that moment with another German officer, saw his friend's plight, and jumped back.  With his sword he swept aside a German bayonet which at that instant would have been buried in Chester's prostrate form, but as he did so a heavy blow fell upon the lad's head and he was sent to his knees. Above him, with poised bayonet, stood a German soldier.  Death stared him in the face and the boy realized it. It was impossible for him to regain his feet in time to ward off the thrust. Quickly he threw himself to one side, and as he did so the German toppled on top of him, lifeless.  Hal scrambled to his feet and saw that the man who had thus saved his life was none other than Lieutenant Harry Anderson.  \"Just in time,\" said Hal briefly, and turned to where Chester was now struggling to his feet; and as the battle raged fiercely about them, unmindful of his own danger, he gave his entire attention to his friend.  Chester, shaking his head several times, announced that he was not seriously hurt, and with Lieutenant Anderson by their side they again plunged into the conflict.  But now the German retreat became more rapid. The enemy was unable to stand under the fierce charge of the British and they were giving way on all sides. The British pursued the foe rapidly and hundreds upon hundreds of the enemy were cut down in their flight.  Unable to keep back the English and retreat orderly, the Germans broke and fled. The retreat had become a rout. For some distance the British pursued them, and then a halt was called.  The losses of the British troops had been extremely heavy, but not so great as that of the enemy, who had suffered tremendously.  Now a thunderous roar broke out. The British artillery, unable to be used while the hand to hand fighting was in progress, was in action again, shelling the fleeing Germans.  The dead strewed the battlefield, and as Hal, Chester and Lieutenant Anderson made their way toward the rear, they were forced to climb over the dead and wounded, many with shattered limbs and maimed for life. But the Red Cross was at work, and the wounded were being cared for with the greatest possible haste and gentleness.  \"That was some fight, if you ask me,\" said Hal to Chester, as they continued their way to the part of the field where they could see General French and his staff, Lieutenant Anderson having left them to rejoin his own men, from whom he had become separated.  \"It was all of that,\" replied Chester, \"and I can't imagine how we escaped with our lives.\"  \"Nor I. It doesn't seem possible that anyone in the midst of such terrible carnage could live, to say nothing of being only slightly wounded. By the way, are you hurt much, Hal?\"  \"No; just a scratch on the face and a bump on the head. And you?\"  \"I was luckier than that, although a German did crack me with his rifle butt.\"  \"Look at the dead and wounded lying about,\" said Hal. \"It is a terrible thing--this modern warfare.\"  \"It is, indeed,\" returned Chester, and the two continued on their way in silence.  General French noticed their approach. The British commander was standing as he had stood through the last part of the battle, exposed to the fire of the enemy, calmly smoking a cigarette!     CHAPTER VI.  THE BRIDGE IS HELD.   At a sign from General French Hal and Chester approached and saluted.  \"Where have you been, sirs?\" demanded the British commander.  Hal stepped forward and explained their absence.  \"And you were in the midst of the charge?\" questioned General French, when the lad concluded.  \"Yes, sir!\"  \"And are not even badly wounded?\"  \"No, sir!\"  \"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the general. Then, after a few moments' silence: \"You seem to bear charmed lives. I believe you are the two for my mission.\"  \"Yes, sir!\" exclaimed Hal eagerly.  \"Both of you report to me in an hour,\" ordered General French.  The two lads saluted again and moved away.  \"Wonder what he wants?\" said Chester.  \"Too deep for me,\" was Hal's reply.  \"He said something about a mission. I guess that means more excitement for us.\"  \"I guess you are right. However, I am sure we can go through with it, no matter what it may be.\"  \"We can try, anyhow. That's the best anyone can do.\"  At the appointed time the two boys made their way to General French's headquarters.  \"I have an important piece of work that must be done, and which will be attended with grave danger; are you willing to undertake it?\" asked the British commander, coming to the point without preliminaries.  \"We shall do our best, sir,\" replied Hal.  \"Good! The enemy has retreated beyond Meaux. To-morrow I shall try and drive him farther. It is absolutely necessary that our movements be not anticipated. As you see we have lost many officers. I want you to lead one hundred men to a position just this side of the bridge. The enemy must not be allowed to cross. One hundred men can hold the bridge as well as ten thousand. The men to go with you have been selected. They have volunteered for this duty. Captain Lee will show you where to find them. Hold the bridge! That is all!\"  The two lads saluted and took their departure. They found Captain Lee, and with him were soon at the head of the little band of men who had volunteered to hold the bridge at Meaux against the whole German army, if necessary.  It was still dark, and it was a quiet little band that advanced through the British lines to take up their positions at the extreme front. A long range artillery duel was still in progress in spite of the darkness, but little damage was being done by either side.  Having retreated beyond Meaux, the Germans had unlimbered their artillery again and the British were replying. The little band of English, with Hal and Chester in lead, advanced to the edge of the bridge described by General French, and there took up their positions.  The bridge was very narrow, hardly wide enough for five men to walk abreast. On the British end the approach curved, making it impossible for one coming from the other direction to see what was at the other end. It was indeed a strategic point for defense. The river was high and thus precluded any attempt to ford it.  All night long the little band of men lay at the bridge, ready for battle on a moment's notice. All night long the shells of both the Germans and British flew screaming overhead; but none dropped near them.  With the first faint glow of the approaching day the little band of British were awake. At Hal's suggestion they cut down trees, and dragged them to the end of the bridge, forming a barricade. Behind this they lay down.  It was almost noon before the man stationed to watch the approach to the bridge dropped quickly over the barricade and reported:  \"They are coming!\"  \"All right,\" replied Hal. \"We're ready for 'em!\"  Under Hal's direction, a single line of rifles, twenty-five in all, appeared through the cracks of the barricade. The others had been divided into three bodies--each containing twenty-five men--each body directly behind the others. These were instructed to fill up the gaps made by the German fire. Thus, as each man in the front rank fell, his place would immediately be filled by another, the second by the third, the third by the fourth, so providing twenty-five men fell the front line would be still intact, although the fourth line would have disappeared.  Hal and Chester took their places just in the"]]]
