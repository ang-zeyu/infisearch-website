One cannot find it by seeking it; it comes to us when we do not expect it. This project of marriage, conceived in cold blood, which Père Maurice laid before him, the unknown fiancée, and, perhaps, even all the good things that were said of her common-sense and her virtue, gave him food for thought. And he went his way, musing as a man muses who has not enough ideas to fight among themselves; that is to say, not formulating in his mind convincing reasons for selfish resistance, but conscious of a dull pain, and not struggling against an evil which it was necessary to accept.  Meanwhile, Père Maurice had returned to the farm-house, while Germain employed the last hour of daylight, between sunset and darkness, in mending the breaches made by the sheep in the hedge surrounding a vineyard near the farm buildings. He raised the stalks of the bushes, and supported them with clods of earth, while the thrushes chattered in the neighboring thicket, and seemed to call to him to make haste, they were so curious to come to examine his work as soon as he had gone.     V  LA GUILLETTE   Père Maurice found in the house an elderly neighbor, who had come to have a chat with his wife, and borrow some embers to light her fire. Mère Guillette lived in a wretched hovel within two gunshots of the farm. But she was a decent woman and a woman of strong will. Her poor house was neat and clean, and her carefully patched clothes denoted proper self-respect with all her poverty.  \"You came to get some fire for the night, eh, Mère Guillette?\" said the old man. \"Is there anything else you would like?\"  \"No, Père Maurice,\" she replied; \"nothing just now. I'm no beggar, you know, and I don't abuse my friends' kindness.\"  \"That's the truth; and so your friends are always ready to do you a service.\"  \"I was just talking with your wife, and I was asking her if Germain had at last made up his mind to marry again.\"  \"You're no gossip,\" replied Père Maurice, \"and one can speak before you without fear of people talking; so I will tell my wife and you that Germain has really made up his mind; he starts to-morrow for Fourche.\"  \"Bless me!\" exclaimed Mère Maurice; \"the poor fellow! God grant that he may find a wife as good and honest as himself!\"  \"Ah! he is going to Fourche?\" observed La Guillette. \"Just see how things turn out! that helps me very much, and as you asked me just now, Père Maurice, if there was anything I wanted, I'll tell you what you can do to oblige me.\"  \"Tell us, tell us, we shall be glad to oblige.\"  \"I would like to have Germain take the trouble to take my daughter with him.\"  \"Where? to Fourche?\"  \"Not to Fourche, but to Ormeaux, where she is going to stay the rest of the year.\"  \"What!\" said Mère Maurice, \"are you going to part from your daughter?\"  \"She has got to go out to service and earn something. It comes hard enough to me and to her, too, poor soul! We couldn't make up our minds to part at midsummer; but now Martinmas is coming, and she has found a good place as shepherdess on the farms at Ormeaux. The farmer passed through here the other day on his way back from the fair. He saw my little Marie watching her three sheep on the common land.--'You don't seem very busy, my little maid,' he said; 'and three sheep are hardly enough for a shepherd. Would you like to keep a hundred? I'll take you with me. The shepherdess at our place has been taken sick and she's going back to her people, and if you'll come to us within a week, you shall have fifty francs for the rest of the year, up to midsummer.'--The child refused, but she couldn't help thinking about it and telling me when she came home at night and found me sad and perplexed about getting through the winter, which is sure to be hard and long, for we saw the cranes and wild geese fly south this year a full month earlier than usual. We both cried; but at last we took courage. We said to each other that we couldn't stay together, because there's hardly enough to keep one person alive on our little handful of land; and then Marie's getting old--here she is nearly sixteen--and she must do as others do, earn her bread and help her poor mother.\"  \"Mère Guillette,\" said the old ploughman, \"if fifty francs was all that was needed to put an end to your troubles and make it unnecessary for you to send your daughter away, why, I would help you to find them, although fifty francs begins to mean something to people like us. But we must consult good sense as well as friendship in everything. If you were saved from want for this winter, you wouldn't be safe from future want, and the longer your daughter postpones taking the step, the harder it will be for you and for her to part. Little Marie is getting to be tall and strong, and she has nothing to do at home. She might fall into lazy habits--\"  \"Oh! as far as that goes, I'm not afraid,\" said Mère Guillette. \"Marie's as brave as a rich girl at the head of a big establishment could be. She doesn't sit still a minute with her arms folded, and when we haven't any work, she cleans and rubs our poor furniture and makes every piece shine like a looking-glass. She's a child that's worth her weight in gold, and I'd have liked it much better to have her come to you as a shepherdess instead of going so far away among people I don't know. You'd have taken her at midsummer if we could have made up our minds; but now you've hired all your help, and we can't think of it again until midsummer next year.\"  \"Oh! I agree with all my heart, Guillette! I shall be very glad to do it. But, meanwhile, she will do well to learn a trade and get used to working for others.\"  \"Yes, of course; the die is cast. The farmer at Ormeaux sent for her this morning; we said yes, and she must go. But the poor child doesn't know the way, and I shouldn't like to send her so far all alone. As your son-in-law is going to Fourche to-morrow, he can just as well take her. It seems that it's very near the farm she's going to, according to what they tell me; for I have never been there myself.\"  \"They're right side by side, and my son-in-law will take her. That's as it should be; indeed, he can take her behind him on the mare, and that will save her shoes. Here he is, coming in to supper. I say, Germain, Mère Guillette's little Marie is going to Ormeaux as shepherdess. You'll take her on your horse, won't you?\"  \"Very well,\" said Germain, who was preoccupied, but always ready to do his neighbor a service.  In our world, it would never occur to a mother to entrust a daughter of sixteen to a man of twenty-eight! for Germain was really only twenty-eight, and although, according to the ideas of his province, he was considered an old man so far as marriage was concerned, he was still the handsomest man in the neighborhood. Work had not furrowed and wrinkled his face, as is the case with most peasants who have ten years of ploughing behind them. He was strong enough to plough ten more years without looking old, and the prejudice of age must have been very strong in a young girl's mind to prevent her remarking that Germain had a fresh complexion, a bright eye, blue as the heavens in May, ruddy lips, superb teeth, and a body as graceful and supple as that of a colt that has never left the pasture.  But chastity is a sacred tradition in certain country districts, far removed from the corrupt animation of large cities, and Maurice's family was noted among all the families of Belair for uprightness, and fidelity to the truth. Germain was going in search of a wife; Marie was too young and too pure for him to think of her in that light, and, unless he was a heartless, bad man, it was impossible that he should have a guilty thought in connection with her. Père Maurice was in no way disturbed, therefore, to see him take the pretty girl _en croupe_; La Guillette would have considered that she was insulting him if she had requested him to respect her as his sister. Marie mounted the mare, weeping bitterly, after she had kissed her mother and her young friends twenty times over. Germain, who was also in a melancholy mood, had the more sympathy with her grief, and rode away with a grave face, while the neighbors waved their hands in farewell to poor Marie, with no thought of evil to come.     VI  PETIT-PIERRE   _Grise_ was young and strong and handsome. She carried her double load easily, putting back her ears and champing her bit like the proud, high-spirited mare she was. As they rode by the long pasture, she spied her mother--who was called Old Grise, as she was called Young Grise--and neighed an adieu. Old Grise approached the fence, making her hopples ring, tried to leap over into the road to follow her daughter; then, seeing that she started off at a fast trot, she neighed in her turn, and stood looking after her, pensive and disturbed in mind, with her nose in the air, and her mouth filled with grass which she forgot to eat.  \"The poor creature still knows her progeny,\" said Germain to divert little Marie's thoughts from her grief. \"That makes me think that I didn't kiss my Petit-Pierre before I started. The bad boy wasn't there. Last night, he strove to make me promise to take him along, and he cried a good hour in his bed. This morning again he tried everything to persuade me. Oh! what a shrewd, wheedling little rascal he is! but when he saw that it couldn't be, monsieur lost his temper: he went off into the fields, and I haven't seen him all day.\"  \"I saw him,\" said Marie, trying to force back her tears. \"He was running toward the woods with the Soulas children, and I thought it likely he had been away for some time, for he was hungry, and was eating wild plums and blackberries off the bushes. I gave him some bread from my luncheon, and he said: 'Thanks, my dear little Marie; when you come to our house, I'll give you some cake.' The little fellow is just too winning, Germain!\"  \"Yes, he is a winning child, and I don't know what I wouldn't do for him,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12816"],["title","The Devil's Pool (#5)"],["body","\" the ploughman replied. \"If his grandmother hadn't had more sense than I, I couldn't have kept from taking him with me when I saw him crying so hard that his poor little heart was all swollen.\"  \"Well! why didn't you bring him, Germain? he wouldn't have been in the way; he's so good when you do what he wants you to.\"  \"It seems that he would have been in the way where I am going. At least, that was Père Maurice's opinion.--For my part, I should have said, on the contrary, that we ought to see how he would be received, and that nobody could help taking kindly to such a dear child.--But they say at the house that I mustn't begin by exhibiting the burdens of the household.--I don't know why I talk to you about this, little Marie: you don't understand it.\"  \"Yes, I do, Germain; I know you are going to get a wife; my mother told me, and bade me not mention it to any one, either at home or where I am going, and you needn't be afraid: I won't say a word.\"  \"You will do well, for it isn't settled; perhaps I shan't suit the lady in question.\"  \"We must hope you will, Germain. Pray, why shouldn't you suit her?\"  \"Who knows? I have three children, and that's a heavy load for a woman who isn't their mother!\"  \"That's true; but your children aren't like other children.\"  \"Do you think so?\"  \"They are as beautiful as little angels, and so well brought up that you can't find more lovable children anywhere.\"  \"There's Sylvain, he's not over good.\"  \"He's very small! he can't be anything but terrible; but he's so bright!\"  \"True, he is bright: and such courage! he isn't a bit afraid of cows or bulls, and if I would permit him, he'd be climbing up on the horses with his older brother.\"  \"If I had been in your place, I'd have brought the older one. Your having such a beautiful child would surely make her love you on the spot!\"  \"Yes, if the woman is fond of children; but suppose she doesn't like them?\"  \"Are there women who don't like children?\"  \"Not many, I think; but there are some, and that is what worries me.\"  \"Then you don't know this woman at all?\"  \"No more than you do, and I am afraid I shall not know her any better after I have seen her. I am not suspicious. When any one says pleasant words to me, I believe them; but I have had reason to repent more than once, for words are not deeds.\"  \"They say she's a fine woman.\"  \"Who says so? Père Maurice?\"  \"Yes, your father-in-law.\"  \"That's all right; but he doesn't know her, either.\"  \"Well, you will soon see her; you will be very careful, and it's to be hoped you won't make any mistake, Germain.\"  \"Look you, little Marie, I should be very glad if you would go into the house for a little while before going on to Ormeaux: you're a shrewd girl, you have always shown that you have a keen mind, and you notice everything. If you see anything that makes you think, you can quietly tell me about it.\"  \"Oh! no, Germain, I wouldn't do that! I should be too much afraid of being mistaken; and, besides, if a word spoken thoughtlessly should disgust you with this marriage, your people would blame me for it, and I have enough troubles without bringing fresh ones on my poor dear mother's head.\"  As they were talking thus, Grise pricked up her ears and shied, then retraced her steps and approached the hedge, where there was something which had frightened her at first, but which she now began to recognize. Germain looked at the hedge and saw something that he took for a lamb in the ditch, under the branches of an oak still thick and green.  \"It's a stray lamb,\" he said, \"or a dead one, for it doesn't move. Perhaps some one is looking for it; we must see.\"  \"It isn't a lamb,\" cried little Marie; \"it's a child asleep; it's your Petit-Pierre.\"  \"Upon my word!\" exclaimed Germain, dismounting; \"just see the little imp lying there asleep, so far from home, and in a ditch, where a snake might find him!\"  He raised the child, who opened his eyes and smiled at him, saying, as he threw his arms around his neck:  \"Little father, you're going to take me with you!\"  \"Oh, yes! still the same song! what were you doing there, naughty Pierre?\"  \"I was waiting for my little father to pass; I was looking out on the road, and I looked so hard I went to sleep.\"  \"And if I had passed without seeing you, you would have stayed out all night and the wolf would have eaten you!\"  \"Oh! I knew you'd see me!\" rejoined Petit-Pierre confidently.  \"Well, kiss me now, Pierre, bid me good-by, and run back to the house if you don't want them to have supper without you.\"  \"Why, ain't you going to take me with you?\" cried the child, beginning to rub his eyes to show that he proposed to weep.  \"You know grandpa and grandma don't approve of it,\" said Germain, taking refuge behind the authority of the old people, like one who places but slight reliance on his own.  But the child heard nothing. He began to cry in good earnest, saying that as long as his father took little Marie, he could take him too. He was told that they would have to go through great forests, that there were many wicked animals there that ate little children, that Grise would not carry three, that she said so when they started, and that in the country they were going to there was no bed or supper for little monkeys. All these excellent reasons did not convince Petit-Pierre; he threw himself on the grass and rolled about, crying that his father did not love him, and that, if he refused to take him with him, he would not go back to the house day or night.  Germain's fatherly heart was as soft and weak as a woman's. His wife's death, the care he had been compelled to bestow upon his little ones, together with the thought that the poor motherless children needed to be dearly loved, had combined to make it so, and such a hard struggle took place within him, especially as he was ashamed of his weakness, and tried to conceal his distress from little Marie, that the perspiration stood out on his forehead and his eyes were bordered with red as if they, too, were all ready to shed tears. Finally, he tried to be angry; but as he turned to little Marie, as if to call her to witness his firmness of will, he saw that the dear girl's face was bathed in tears, and, all his courage deserting him, it was impossible for him to keep back his own, although he continued to scold and threaten.  \"Really, your heart is too hard,\" said little Marie at last, \"and for my part, I could never hold out like that against a child who is so unhappy. Come, Germain, take him along. Your mare is used to carrying two grown people and a child, for your brother-in-law and his wife, who is much heavier than I am, go to market every Saturday, with their boy, on the honest creature's back. You can put him up in front of you; indeed, I'd rather go all alone on foot than make the little fellow suffer so.\"  \"Don't be disturbed about that,\" said Germain, who was dying with anxiety to be persuaded. \"Grise is strong, and would carry two more if there was room on her backbone. But what shall we do with the child on the way? he will be cold and hungry--and who will look after him to-night and to-morrow, put him to bed, wash him and dress him? I don't dare put that trouble on a woman whom I don't know, and who will think, I have no doubt, that I stand very little on ceremony with her for a beginning.\"  \"According to the good-will or annoyance she shows, you will be able to judge her at once, Germain, believe me; and at all events, if she doesn't take to your Pierre, I will take charge of him. I will go to her house to dress him, and I'll take him into the fields to-morrow. I'll amuse him all day, and see that he has all he needs.\"  \"And he'll tire you out, my poor girl! He'll be a burden to you! a whole day--that's a long while!\"  \"On the contrary, I shall enjoy it; he will be company for me, and make me less unhappy the first day I shall have to pass in a new country. I shall fancy I am still at home.\"  The child, seeing that little Marie was taking his part, had clung to her skirt and held it so tight that she would have had to hurt him to take it away. When he saw that his father was yielding, he took Marie's hand in both his little sunburned ones and kissed it, leaping for joy, and pulling her toward the mare with the burning impatience that children show in all their desires.  \"Well, well,\" said the girl, taking him in her arms, \"we must try to soothe this poor heart that is jumping like a little bird's, and if you feel cold when night comes, my Pierre, just tell me, and I'll wrap you in my cloak. Kiss your little father, and ask him to forgive you for being such a bad boy. Tell him that it shall never happen again! never, do you hear?\"  \"Yes, yes, on condition that I always do what he wants me to, eh?\" said Germain, wiping the little fellow's eyes with his handkerchief. \"Ah! Marie, you will spoil the rascal for me!--And really, little Marie, you're too good. I don't know why you didn't come to us as shepherdess last midsummer. You could have taken care of my children, and I would rather have paid you a good price for waiting on them than go in search of a wife who will be very likely to think that she's doing me a great favor by not detesting them.\"  [Illustration: Chapter VI  _He raised the child, who opened his eyes and smiled at him, saying, as he threw his arms around his neck.  \"Little father, you are going to take me with you_!\"]  \"You mustn't look on the dark side of things like that,\" replied little Marie, holding the rein while Germain placed his son on the front of the heavy goat-skin-covered saddle; \"if your wife doesn't like children, you can hire me next year, and I'll amuse them so well that they won't notice anything, never you fear.\"     VII  ON THE MOOR   \"By the way,\" said Germain, when they had ridden on a short distance, \"what will they think at home when this little man doesn't appear? The old people will be anxious, and they will scour the country for him.\"  \"You can tell the man"]]]
