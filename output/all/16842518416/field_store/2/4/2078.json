He did not wait to take a second thought, but seized the ax, and, with one bound, reached the gangway that led out on to the forecastle. Here he hesitated again, but it was only for a moment. Clutching his ax with a firmer hold, and gathering all his strength for the trial, he sprang forward, and a few rapid steps brought him to the capstan, to which the line was made fast. He raised his ax, and one swift blow severed the line, and the Milwaukee swung rapidly out from the bank Without waiting an instant, Frank turned and retreated; but, instead of going back to the place where he had left Simpson, he bounded up the steps that led to the boiler-deck, and the next moment was safe behind a pile of baled clothing. His sudden appearance had taken the rebels completely by surprise, and before they could recover themselves, the line had been cut, and the young hero was safe. But they had seen where he had taken refuge, and, with loud yells of disappointment and rage, sent their bullets about his hiding-place in a perfect shower. Frank, however, knowing that he was safe, was not in the least alarmed. Waiting until the fire slackened a little, he sprang up, and, snatching a musket and cartridge-box from the rack which stood close by the door of the cabin, was back to his hiding-place in a moment.  \"Now,\" he soliloquized, \"we are on more equal terms. Better keep close, or I'll drop some of you.\"  In his cool, sober moments, Frank would have shuddered at the thought of taking the life of a fellow-being; but he had seen Simpson shot down before his eyes--perhaps killed; and is it to be wondered that he wished to avenge his fall?  It was some time before Frank could get an opportunity to use his musket; for if he exposed the smallest portion of his body, it was the signal for his watchful enemies, who sent the bullets about him in unpleasant proximity. In spite of his dangerous situation, he could not help thinking that the rebels were very proficient in \"Indian fighting,\" for, with all his watchfulness, he could not get an opportunity to put in a shot. All he could see of his enemies would be, first, a rifle thrust carefully over the levee, then a very small portion of a head would appear, and the bullet would come straight to the mark.  In the mean time the Milwaukee was working her way out into the stream, and the rebels, finding that their fire was not returned, grew bolder by degrees, and became less careful to conceal themselves. This was what Frank wanted; but he reserved his fire until a tall rebel rose to his full hight from behind the levee, fired his gun, and stood watching the effect of the shot. Frank's musket was at his shoulder in an instant, his finger pressed the trigger, and the rebel staggered for a moment, and disappeared behind the levee.  \"There,\" said Frank to himself, \"that's what Simpson would call 'squaring the yards.' I'm even with the rascals now.\"  The rebels answered the shot with load yells, and their bullets fell thicker than ever; but the Milwaukee was almost out of range, and, in a few moments, the firing ceased altogether.     CHAPTER VII.  On a Gun-boat.   When the Milwaukee was fairly out of range of the bullets of the guerrillas, Frank put his gun back in the rack, and started in search of the doctor's steward. He ran into the cabin without ceremony, and was about to enter the steward's room, when he discovered a pair of patent-leather boots, which he thought he recognized, sticking out from under a mattress which lay on the cabin floor; and, upon examination, he found that it concealed the steward, who was as pale as a sheet, and shaking as though he had been seized with the ague.  \"What do you want here?\" he asked, in a trembling voice, as Frank raised the mattress.  \"Simpson is shot,\" answered Frank, \"and I would like to have you come down and see him.\"  \"Do you suppose I am fool enough to go out on deck, and run the risk of being shot? No, sir; I'll stay here, where I am safe;\" and the steward made an effort to draw his head under the mattress again.  \"There's no danger now,\" said Frank; \"the rebels have stopped firing. Besides, we are out of\"--  \"Go away, and let me alone,\" whined the steward.  \"I am not going to expose myself.\"  \"You're a coward,\" exclaimed Frank, now fairly aroused \"But I guess the captain can\"--  \"Oh, don't,\" entreated the steward; \"I haven't been here a minute. I started to get a gun, to pay the rebels back in their own coin; but the bullets came through the cabin so thick that I thought it best to retreat to a safe place;\" and the steward threw off the mattress, and arose, tremblingly, to his feet.  \"You went after a gun, did you?\" inquired Frank, in a tone of voice which showed that he did not believe the steward's story.  \"Yes; and I would have given them fits, for I am a dead shot.\"  \"Where did you put your gun when you found that you had to retreat?\"  \"I put it back in the rack again.\"  This was a likely story; for a person as badly frightened as was the steward would not have stopped to put the gun back in its place; and, in his heart, Frank despised the man who could be guilty of such a falsehood.  As they were about to go out on deck, the steward drew back, exclaiming:  \"I don't hardly believe it is safe to go out there just yet. Let us wait a few moments.\"  \"I shan't wait an instant,\" said Frank. \"Simpson has been neglected too long already. You can come down and attend to him, or not, just as you please.\" So saying, he opened the cabin door, and walking rapidly out, descended the stairs that led to the main deck.  The steward dreaded to follow; but he knew that, if he did not attend the wounded sailor, he would be reported to the captain, who, although a kind-hearted man, was a strict disciplinarian, and one who always took particular pains to see that his crew was well provided for. He dared not hesitate long; so, drawing in a long breath, he ran swiftly out on deck, and disappeared down the stairs like a shot.  Frank found Simpson sitting upon the mattress where he had been lain, with his elbows on his knees, and his head supported by his hands. As Frank came up, he said, in a weak voice:  \"I came very near losing the number of my mess, didn't I? The rascals shot pretty close to me;\" and he showed Frank an ugly-looking wound in the back of his head, from which the blood was flowing profusely.  By this time the steward arrived. After examining the wound, he pronounced it very severe, and one that would require constant attention.  Simpson was speedily conveyed to the sick bay, and every thing possible done to make him comfortable. Although the Milwaukee was completely riddled by the bullets of the guerrillas, he was the only one hurt. Frank was excused from all duty, that he might act as Simpson's nurse; and he scarcely left him for a moment during the two weeks of fever and delirium that followed. By the time they reached Cairo, however, he was pronounced out of danger.  Frank wanted very much to see his cousin; but the Milwaukee was anchored out in the river, and no one was allowed to go ashore. One afternoon, as he sat by his friend's hammock, reading aloud a letter from Harry Butler, in which he gave a vivid description of a late battle in which his regiment had participated, the orderly entered and informed him that the captain wished to see him. He followed the orderly, and, as he entered the cabin, the captain said:  \"Please help yourself to a chair, Mr. Nelson; I shall be at liberty in a moment. I should like to finish this letter before the mail-steamer sails. You will excuse me, will you not?\"  \"Certainly, sir,\" answered Frank; and he seated himself, lost in wonder.  The captain had addressed him as _Mr._ Nelson, while heretofore he had always been called, by the officers, Nelson, or Frank. What could it mean? The captain had always treated him with the greatest kindness; but, since the engagement with the guerrillas, all the officers had shown him more consideration than ever. He had noticed the change, and wondered at it.  At length the captain, after hastily directing the letter he had written, and giving it in charge of the orderly, took an official document from his desk, saying, as he did so:  \"I am greatly pleased, Mr. Nelson, to be able to give you this, for you deserve it;\" and after unfolding the letter, he gave it to Frank, who read as follows:      NAVY DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 18, 1862.      Sir: For your gallantry in the late action at Cypress Bend, on the     1st inst., you are hereby appointed an Acting Master's Mate in the     Navy of the United States, on temporary service. Report, without     delay, to Acting Rear-Admiral David D. Porter, for such duty as he     may assign you. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,      GIDEON WELLES, _Secretary of the Navy,_      Acting Master's Mate FRANK NELSON,     _S.S. Milwaukee, Mississippi Squadron._  \"Well,\" said the captain, after Frank had read the letter over three times, to make sure that he was not dreaming, and that he was really an officer, \"what do you think of it?\"  \"I hardly know what to think, sir,\" answered Frank. \"It is an honor I did not expect.\"  \"Very likely,\" said the captain, with a laugh; \"but you deserve it. If it hadn't been for you, we should all have been captured. I saw the whole of the transaction from the pilot-house.\"  \"It was my duty to do it, sir.\"  \"It was a brave act, call it what else you will. Now go and give this to the paymaster,\" continued the captain, handing Frank an order for the settlement of his accounts, \"and then go immediately and report to the Admiral.\"  Frank left the captain, a good deal elated at his success; and when he approached Simpson, the latter exclaimed:  \"What is it, my hearty? Your promotion?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Frank; \"read that;\" and he handed his appointment to his friend, who said:  \"I knew you would get it. The captain isn't the man "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#8)"],["body","let such a thing as you did at Cypress Bend pass unnoticed. Give us your flipper, my boy; I'm glad to see you an officer.\" And the brave fellow actually shed tears, as he shook Frank's hand. \"Now, when you are ordered to your ship,\" he continued, \"I wish you would speak a word for me. I am very well contented here, but I had much rather sail with you.\"  Frank promised to do his best, and, after putting on his \"shore togs,\" as Simpson called them, and giving the captain's order to the paymaster, he started off to report to the Admiral.  When he arrived on board the flag-ship, he was met by the officer of the deck, who inquired his business.  \"I wish to see the Admiral, sir\" answered Frank; \"I am ordered to report to him.\"  The officer immediately led the way aft, and showed Frank a marine standing at the door of the cabin, who took his name and disappeared. In a moment he returned, and informed Frank that the Admiral was waiting to see him.  He entered the cabin, and handed his appointment to the Admiral, who, after reading it, said:  \"So, you are the young man that saved the Milwaukee, are you? Take a chair, sir.\"  In a few moments his orders to report, without delay, on board the Ticonderoga, were ready; and as the Admiral handed them to him, he said:  \"Now, young man, you will be on a ship where you will have a chance to distinguish yourself. I shall expect to hear a good account of you.\"  \"I shall always endeavor to do my duty, sir,\" answered Frank; and he made his best bow and retired.  When he returned to the Milwaukee, his accounts had all been made out. After the paymaster paid him up in full, Frank started for the nearest clothing-store, and when he came out, he was changed into a fine-looking officer.  He immediately directed his steps toward the naval wharf-boat, where he found a lively little fellow, who seemed full of business, superintending the loading of a vessel with provisions. It was Archie Winters; but it was plain that he did not recognize his cousin in his new uniform, for Frank stood close behind him, several moments, and Archie even brushed against him, as he passed.  \"Can you tell me, sir, where I can find Mr. Winters?\" inquired Frank, at length.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Archie, promptly, looking his cousin full in the face; \"I'm the--why, Frank, how are you?\" and he seized his cousin's hand, and shook it heartily. \"I've been on board the Milwaukee twice this morning, but you were off somewhere. I heard you had a fight down the river, with the rebels. But what are you doing? What boat are you ordered to?\"  \"I am not doing any thing at present,\" answered Frank; \"but I am ordered to report on board the Ticonderoga.\"  \"There she is,\" said Archie, pointing to a long, low, black vessel that lay alongside of the wharf boat. \"I am just putting provisions on board of her. I'll come and see you as soon as I get my work done.\"  Frank went on board his vessel, where he was received by the officer of the deck, who showed him the way into the cabin. After the captain had indorsed his orders, he strolled leisurely about the ship, examining into every thing, for as yet he knew nothing of gun-boat life.  The Ticonderoga was a queer-looking craft. She was not exactly a Monitor; but she had a turret forward, and mounted two eleven-inch guns and four twelve-pounder howitzers. She had a heavy iron ram on her bow, and the turret was protected by three inches of iron, and the deck with two inches. It did not seem possible that a cannon-ball could make any impression on her thick armor.  The officers' quarters were all below decks; and, although it was then the middle of winter, Frank found it rather uncomfortable in his bunk.  During the two weeks that elapsed before the ship was ready to sail, the time was employed in getting every thing in order--in drilling at the great guns, and with muskets and broad-swords.  Most of the crew were old seamen, who understood their duty; and by the time their sailing orders came, every thing moved like clock-work.  In the mean time Frank had been assigned his station, which--being the youngest officer on board the ship--was to command the magazine. He learned very rapidly, and, as he was always attentive to his duties, he grew in favor with both officers and men.  At length, one afternoon, the anchor was weighed, and the Ticonderoga steamed down the river. Her orders were to report to the Admiral, who had sailed from Cairo about a week previous. They found him at Arkansas Post, where they arrived too late to take part in the fight. In a few days a station was assigned to her in the Mississippi River; and the Ticonderoga immediately set sail, in obedience to orders.     CHAPTER VIII.  The Struggle Between the Lines.   One day, about two weeks after they came out of Arkansas River, the Ticonderoga stopped at Smith's Landing to take on wood, as her supply of coal had run short. The vessel was made fast to the bank, and, while the seamen were bringing in the wood, the paymaster's steward called Frank's attention to some cattle which were feeding on the bank, and remarked: \"I wish we could go out and shoot one of them.\" \"So do I,\" said Frank; \"I've eaten salt pork until I am tired of it. Let's go and ask the captain.\"  \"I'm agreed,\" said the steward.  The captain was walking on deck at the time and his permission was readily obtained, for he himself had grown tired of ship's pork; Frank, accompanied by the steward, and a seaman who was an expert butcher, started out. They were armed with muskets, and, as they were all good shots, and did not wish to kill more than enough to feed the ship's company once, they took with them no ammunition besides what was in the guns. At the place where the Ticonderoga was lying, the levee--an embankment about six feet high, built to prevent the water from overflowing--ran back into the woods about half a mile, then, making a bend like a horse-shoe, came back to the river again, inclosing perhaps a dozen acres of low, swampy land; and it was in this swamp that the cattle were. They proved to be very wild; but, after a considerable run, Frank succeeded in bringing down one, and the steward and seaman finally killed another. The question now was, how to get the meat on board the vessel. While they were debating on the matter, they were startled by the clatter of horses' hoofs on the levee; and, instead of drawing back into the bushes, out of sight, they very imprudently waited to see who the horsemen were. Presently, a party of guerrillas, to their utter amazement--for they had not dreamed that the rebels were so near them--galloped up.  The rebels discovered them at the same moment, and one of them exclaimed:  \"I'll be dog-gone if thar ain't a Yank;\" and, not knowing how many there might be of the \"Yanks,\" they very prudently drew up their horses. One of them, however, who appeared to be the leader of the band, comprehended their situation at a glance, and exclaimed:  \"Throw down your arms, and you shall be treated like men!\"  This brought them to their senses, and they turned and ran for their lives. They had scarcely made a dozen steps before the bullets and buckshot began to rattle about their ears; but the trees and bushes were so thick that they escaped unhurt. Frank reached the vessel far in advance of the others; as he came over the side, panting and excited, the captain, who was still on deck, inquired:  \"What's the matter, Mr. Nelson?\"  \"We ran foul of some guerrillas out there in the woods, sir,\" replied Frank.  \"How many of them did you see?\"  \"They didn't give us much of a chance to judge of their numbers, sir; but I should say that there were at least a dozen of them, and they were coming this way. I shouldn't wonder if they intended to pick off some of the men who are carrying in wood.\"  \"Mr. Hurd,\" said the captain, turning to the executive officer, \"take thirty men, who are good shots, and go out there and keep those fellows off. Mr. Nelson will go with you.\"  Frank accordingly ran below, and armed himself with a revolver and musket, and buckled on a cartridge-box. When the men were ready, he led the way, along the levee, so that, if the guerrillas were advancing, they would be certain to meet them. But they saw no signs of them until they came within sight of a barn which stood in the woods, about a mile from the river. The rebels were gathered before it, as if in consultation, and greeted the approach of the sailors with a scattering volley of musketry, which whistled harmlessly over their heads, or plowed up the ground before them.  \"Give 'em a shot, boys,\" said the executive officer, \"and then scatter, and let each man take to a tree and fight Indian fashion.\"  The sailors wheeled into line with all the promptness and regularity of veteran troops; and before the smoke of their muskets cleared away, they had disappeared, like a flock of young partridges. The rebels had also treed, and the skirmish was continued for half an hour, without any damage being done to either party.  This style of fighting did not suit Frank, and he began to urge the executive officer to advance, and drive them from their position. But the officer did not think it safe to attempt it; for, although he had seen but a small number of the rebels, he did not know how many there might be hidden away in the bushes.  \"Well, then,\" said Frank, after thinking a moment, \"I have another proposition to make. If you will give me ten men, and engage the rebels warmly in front, I'll go and get that fresh beef.\"  \"Where did you leave it?\" inquired the officer.  \"In the woods, about three hundred yards to the left of where the rebels now are.\"  \"Very well; pick out your men, and go ahead.\"  Frank accordingly selected the boatswain's mate, an old, gray-headed man, who had been in the navy from boyhood, as his first lieutenant, and ordered him to call for volunteers.  If there is any thing a sailor admires, it is bravery in an officer. Every one on board the Ticonderoga,"]]]
