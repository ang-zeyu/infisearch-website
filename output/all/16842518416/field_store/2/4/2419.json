Place on the fire, and stir until all the chocolate is dissolved. Now add one pint of granulated sugar, and stir until it begins to boil. Cook for three minutes longer, then strain and cool. When cool, add one tablespoonful of vanilla extract. Bottle, and keep in a cold place.   REFRESHING DRINKS FOR SUMMER  Put into a tumbler about two tablespoonfuls of broken ice, two tablespoonfuls of chocolate syrup, three tablespoonfuls of whipped cream, one gill of milk, and half a gill of soda-water from a syphon bottle, or Apollinaris water. Stir well before drinking. A tablespoonful of vanilla ice-cream is a desirable addition. It is a delicious drink, even if the soda or Apollinaris water and ice-cream be omitted. A plainer drink is made by combining the syrup, a gill and a half of milk, and the ice, shaking well.   A FEW SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CHOCOLATE  The best flavor to add to chocolate is vanilla; next to that, cinnamon. Beyond these two things one should use great caution, as it is very easy to spoil the fine natural flavor of the bean. Chocolate absorbs odors readily; therefore it should be kept in a pure, sweet atmosphere. As about eleven per cent. of the chocolate bean is starch, chocolate and cocoa are of a much finer flavor if boiled for a few minutes. Long boiling, however, ruins their flavor and texture.     Recipes Specially Prepared _by_ Miss Elizabeth Kevill Burr  (All measurements should be level.)   FORMULA FOR MAKING THREE GALLONS OF BREAKFAST COCOA      1/2 a pound of Walter Baker & Co.'s Cocoa,     1-1/2 gallons of water, hot,     1-1/2 gallons of milk, hot.  This should not be allowed to boil. Either make it in a large double-boiler, or a large saucepan or kettle over water. Mix the cocoa with enough cold water to make a paste, and be sure it is free from lumps. Heat together the milk and water, and pour in the cocoa; then cook at least an hour, stirring occasionally.   CRACKED COCOA  To one-third a cup of Baker's Cracked Cocoa (sometimes called \"Cocoa Nibs\") use three cups of cold water; cook slowly at least one hour--the longer the better. Then strain the liquid and add one cup (or more if desired) of milk, and serve very hot. Do not allow the mixture to boil after milk has been added.   VANILLA CHOCOLATE WITH WHIPPED CREAM      One cake (1/2 a pound) of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,     4 cups of boiling water,     Pinch of salt,     4 cups of hot milk.  This must be made in a double-boiler. Put the chocolate, boiling water and salt in upper part of the double-boiler. Stir and beat with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is dissolved and smooth. Add the milk and when thoroughly hot, strain, and serve with unsweetened whipped cream. More cooking will improve it.   CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE  Line a pie plate with rich pie crust, putting on an extra edge of crust the same as for custard pie. Fill with the chocolate filling made after the following recipe. Bake in a hot oven until crust is done; remove, and when cool, cover with a meringue and brown very slowly in moderate oven.   CHOCOLATE FILLING      1 cup of milk,     Pinch of salt,     1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,     2 eggs (yolks),     5 tablespoonfuls of sugar (level),     1 teaspoonful of vanilla.  Put milk, salt and chocolate in upper part of the double-boiler, and when hot and smooth, stir in the flour, which has been mixed with enough cold milk to be thin enough to pour into the hot milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens; then let it cook eight or ten minutes. Mix the eggs and sugar together and pour the hot mixture over them, stirring well; put back in double-boiler and cook, stirring constantly one minute. Remove, and when cool add one teaspoonful of vanilla.   MERINGUE      2 eggs (whites),     Pinch of salt,     4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla.  Add salt to eggs and beat in a large shallow dish with fork or egg-whip until stiff and flaky and dish can be turned upside down. Beat in the sugar slowly, then the vanilla, and beat until the dish can be turned upside down.   COCOA STICKS      6 tablespoonfuls of butter,     3/4 cup of sugar (scant),     1 egg,     1 tablespoonful of milk,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla or pinch of cinnamon,     5 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     1/8 teaspoonful of baking powder,     1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups of sifted pastry flour.  Cream the butter until soft; add the sugar gradually and beat well; add the beaten egg, milk and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Sift cocoa, baking powder, and a pinch of salt with about one-half cup of the flour; stir this into the mixture first, then use the remainder of the flour, and more if necessary, to make a firm dough that will not stick to the fingers. Set on the ice to harden. Sprinkle the board with cocoa and a very little sugar. Use small pieces of the dough at a time, toss it over the board to prevent sticking, roll out thin, cut in strips about one-half inch wide and three inches long. Place closely in pan and bake in moderately hot oven three or four minutes. Great care should be taken in the baking to prevent burning.  It is advisable to gather the scraps after each rolling, if soft, and set away to harden, for fear of getting in too much cocoa, thus making them bitter.  The colder and harder the dough is, the better it can be handled; therefore it can be made the day before using.   COCOA FROSTING      4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,     3 tablespoonfuls of hot water,     1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,     About 1-3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar.  Put the cocoa in a small saucepan; add the cold water and stir until perfectly smooth; then the hot water, and cook for one or two minutes, add vanilla and a speck of salt, then stir in enough sugar to make it stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat until smooth and glossy and free from lumps.  If too thick, add a little cold water. If not thick enough, add a little sugar. Never make a frosting so stiff that it will have to be made smooth with a wet knife. It is better to let it run to the sides of the cake. For frosting sides of the cake, make a little stiffer.  This frosting never cracks as an egg frosting, but is hard enough to cut nicely.   COCOA SAUCE      2 tablespoonfuls of butter,     1 cup of boiling water,     2 tablespoonfuls of flour,     4 tablespoonfuls of sugar,     4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla.  Melt the butter in the saucepan; mix the flour and cocoa together and stir into the butter; add gradually the hot water, stirring and beating each time; cook until it thickens. Just before serving, add the sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt, if necessary.  Use more cocoa if liked stronger. This sauce will be found excellent for cottage puddings, Dutch apple cakes, steamed apple puddings, etc.   COCOA CAKE      1/2 a cup of butter,     3/4 a cup of milk,     1 cup of sugar,     6 level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     3 eggs,     2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla,     1-1/2 or 2 cups of sifted pastry flour.  Cream the butter, stir in the sugar gradually, add the unbeaten eggs, and beat all together until very creamy. Sift together one-half cup of the flour, the cocoa and baking powder; use this flour first, then alternate the milk and remaining flour, using enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon; add vanilla and beat until very smooth; then bake in loaf in moderately hot oven thirty-five or forty minutes.  Tests for baking cake. It is baked enough when: 1. It shrinks from the pan. 2. Touching it on the top, springs back. 3. No singing sound.   COCOA MERINGUE PUDDING      1 cup of milk,     2 eggs (yolks),     2 tablespoonfuls of flour,     Pinch of salt,     4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,     1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla.  Put the milk in the upper part of the double-boiler, and heat. Mix flour and cocoa together and soften in a little cold milk; mix until free from lumps. When the milk is hot, add the flour, and cook, stirring often, eight or ten minutes. Beat yolks of eggs lightly; add sugar and salt, and mix well. When mixture in double-boiler has cooked sufficiently, strain it over the mixture in the bowl. Put back in double-boiler and allow it to cook one or two minutes (stirring constantly), just enough to slightly thicken the eggs. Remove from the stove, and when cool add vanilla and put in the serving-dish. Cover with a meringue. Place dish on a board, put in the oven with the door open, and allow it to remain there for ten or fifteen minutes, and when the meringue will not stick to the fingers, close the door and let it brown slightly. This pudding can be eaten warm or cold, but is much better cold. This will serve four persons generously.   CHOCOLATE ALMONDS  Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water on them, and let them stand two or three minutes. Roast them in oven. Dip them in the following recipe for chocolate coating, and drop on paraffine paper.      1/2 pound cake of Walter Baker's Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,     2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water.  Put chocolate in small saucepan over boiling water and when melted stir in butter and water. Mix well. If found to be too thick, add more water; if too thin, more chocolate.   HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE      1 cup of boiling water,     Pinch of salt,     1 square of chocolate,     1/2 a cup of sugar.  Cook all together slowly until it is the consistency of maple syrup, or thicker if desired. Just before serving, add one teaspoonful of vanilla. This will keep indefinitely, and can be reheated.   COCOA SPONGE CAKE      4 eggs,     1/4 a cup of sugar,     Pinch of salt,     4 tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,     1/2 a cup of sifted "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],["title","Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#6)"],["body","flour,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla.  Separate yolks from whites of eggs; beat yolks in a small bowl with the Dover egg-beater until very thick; add sugar, salt and vanilla, and beat again until very thick. Sift cocoa and the flour together and stir very lightly into the mixture; fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and bake in a loaf in a moderate oven until done.  Do not butter the pan, but when cake is baked, invert the pan; and when cool, remove the cake.   CHOCOLATE FROSTING      1 square of Baker's Chocolate,     Pinch of salt,     5 tablespoonfuls of boiling water,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla,     About three cups of sifted confectioners' sugar.  Melt chocolate in bowl over tea-kettle, add water, salt and vanilla, and when smooth add the sugar, and heat until very glossy. Make the frosting stiff enough to spread without using a wet knife. It will keep indefinitely.   CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR DEVIL'S FOOD      5 level tablespoonfuls of butter,     1-1/4 cups of sugar,     3-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate, (melted),     3 eggs,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla,     3/4 a cup of milk,     3-1/2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,     1-1/2 cups of sifted pastry flour.  Cream the butter, add sugar and chocolate, then the unbeaten eggs and vanilla, and beat together until very smooth. Sift the baking powder with one-half a cup of the flour, and use first; then alternate the milk and the remaining flour, and make the mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon. Beat until very smooth and bake in loaf in moderate oven. For tests see Cocoa Cake recipe on page 25.   CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM      1 quart of milk,     Pinch of salt,     3 squares of Baker's Chocolate,     3 level tablespoonfuls of flour,     1 can of sweetened condensed milk,     3 eggs,     6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,     3 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.  Put milk, salt and chocolate in double-boiler, and when milk is hot and chocolate has melted, stir in the flour, previously mixed in a little cold milk. Cook ten minutes, then pour this over the condensed milk, eggs and sugar mixed together; cook again for four minutes, stirring. Strain, and when cool add vanilla, and freeze.   CHOCOLATE WHIP      1 cup of milk,     1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,     Pinch of salt,     2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,     2 eggs (yolks),     6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,     2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla,     5 eggs (whites).

Mix together the yolks of the eggs and sugar, then pour the hot mixture over it; cook again one or two minutes, stirring. When very cold, just before serving, add the vanilla and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pile lightly in a glass dish and serve with lady fingers. A meringue can be made of the whites of the eggs and sugar, then folded in the chocolate mixture, but it does not stand as long.   COCOA MARBLE CAKE      6 level tablespoonfuls of butter,     1 cup of granulated sugar,     3 eggs,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla,     3/4 a cup of milk.

Two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one and three-quarter cups of sifted flour or enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon. Bake in buttered gem pans in moderately hot oven twenty-three or twenty-five minutes. If the cake springs back after pressing a finger on the top, it shows that it is baked enough. To make a cocoa cottage pudding add to the above rule six level tablespoonfuls of cocoa. Serve with a vanilla sauce.   VANILLA SAUCE      2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,     1 cup of boiling water,     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,     4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,     Pinch of salt,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Mix all ingredients together but vanilla; cook, stirring constantly, until it begins to boil, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, eight or ten minutes, or until it makes a firm ball when dropped in cold water. When cooked enough, add the vanilla and beat until it seems like very cold molasses in winter. Pour into a buttered pan; when firm, cut in squares. Great care must be taken not to beat too much, because it cannot be poured into the pan, and will not have a gloss on top.     Miss M.E. Robinson's Recipes   PLAIN CHOCOLATE      1 ounce or square of Baker's Premium Chocolate,     3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,     1/8 a teaspoonful of salt,     1 pint of boiling water,     1 pint of milk.  Place the chocolate, sugar and salt in the agate chocolate-pot or saucepan, add the boiling water and boil three minutes, stirring once or twice, as the chocolate is not grated.
