Just the same the Rustlers were delighted to find themselves beaten by a trick so simple and splendid that it fairly took their breath away.  For it was the Navy team, not the Rustlers, who met the enemy from the colleges and from West Point.  Rustlers and team men alike prayed for the triumph of the Navy in every game that was fought out.  \"You never told me that you had that trick, Darry,\" muttered Wolgast, in the rest that followed this swift, brilliant play.  \"I wanted to show it to you before telling you about it\" laughed Dave.  \"Why?\"  \"Because I didn't know whether it were any good.\"  \"Any good?  Why, Darry, if you can get up one or two more like that you'll be the greatest gridiron tactician that the Navy has ever had!\"  \"I didn't get up that one,\" Dave confessed modestly.  \"You didn't, Mr. Darrin?\" interposed Coach Parker.  \"Who did?\"  \"Mr. Jetson, sir.\"  \"I helped a bit,\" admitted Jetson, turning red as he found himself the center of admiring gazes.  \"Dalzell and Darrin helped work it out, too.\"  \"Have you any more like that one, Mr. Darrin?\" questioned Coach Parker.  \"I think we have a few, sir,\" Dave smiled steadily.  \"Are you ready to exhibit them, Mr. Darrin?\"  \"We'll show 'em all, if you order it, sir,\" Darrin answered respectfully.  \"But we'll undoubtedly spring two or three of 'em, anyway, in this afternoon's practice.\"  \"I'll be patient, then,\" nodded coach.  \"But I want a brief talk with you after practice, Mr. Darrin.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  \"I just want you to sketch out the new plays to me in private, that I may consider them,\" explained the lieutenant-commander.  \"Yes, sir.  But I am not really the originator of any of the new plays.  Mr. Dalzell and Mr. Jetson have had as much to do with all of the new ones as I have, sir.\"  \"And this is Darrin's last year!  The Navy will never have his like again,\" groaned one fourth classman to another.  \"Ready to resume play!\" called coach.  \"Navy to start the ball.\"  The play was on again, in earnest, but this time it fell to the right flank of, the Navy team to stop the onward rush of the Rustlers as they charged down with the ball after the Navy's kick-off.  In fact, not during the team practice did Dave or Dan get a chance to show another of their new tricks.  \"Just our luck!\" grunted many of the spectators.  Meanwhile Dave, Dan and Jet got out of their togs, and through with their shower baths as quickly as they could, for Lieutenant-Commander Parker was on hand, awaiting them impatiently.  Until close to supper call did the coach hold converse with these three men of the Navy's left flank.  Then the lieutenant-commander went to Midshipman Wolgast, who was waiting.  \"Mr. Wolgast, I see the Army's banner trailed low in the dust this year,\" laughed coach.  \"These young gentlemen have been explaining to me some new plays that will cause wailing and gnashing of teeth at West Point.\"  \"I'm afraid, sir, that you forget one thing,\" smiled Darrin.  \"What is that, sir?\" demanded coach.  \"Why, sir, the Army has Prescott and Holmes, beyond a doubt, for they played last year.\"  \"I saw Prescott and Holmes last year,\" nodded Mr. Parker.  \"But they didn't have a thing to compare with what you've just been explaining to me.\"  \"May I remark, sir, that that was last year?\" suggested Dave.  \"Then you think that Prescott and Holmes may have developed some new plays.\"  \"I'd be amazed, sir, if they hadn't done so.  And I've tried to have the Navy always bear in mind, sir, that Dalzell and myself learned everything we know of football under Dick Prescott, who, for his weight, I believe to be the best football player in the United States!\"  \"You're not going to get cold feet, are you, Mr. Darrin?\" laughed Lieutenant-Commander Parker.  \"No, sir; but, on the other hand, I don't want to underestimate the enemy.\"  \"You don't seem likely to commit that fault, Mr. Darrin.  For my part,\" went on coach, \"I'm going to feel rather satisfied that Prescott and Holmes, of the Army, won't be able to get up anything that will equal or block the new plays you've been describing to me.\"  Dave and Dan were more than usually excited as they lingered in their room, awaiting the call to supper formation.  Farley and Page, all ready to respond to the call, were also in the room.  \"I hope old Dick and Greg haven't got anything new that will stop us!\" glowed Dan Dalzell.  \"It's just barely possible, of course,\" assented Darrin, \"that they haven't.\"  \"If they haven't,\" chuckled Farley gleefully, \"then we scuttle the Army this year.\"  \"Wouldn't it be truly great,\" laughed Page, \"to see the great Prescott go down in the dust of defeat.  Ha, ha!  I can picture, right now, the look of amazement on his Army face!\"  \"We mustn't laugh too soon,\" Dave warned his hearers.  \"Don't you want to see the redoubtable Prescott shoved into the middle of next year?\" challenged Midshipman Page.  \"Oh, yes; of course.  Yet that's not because he's Prescott, for good old Dick is one of the most precious friends I have in the world,\" Dave answered earnestly.  \"I want to see Prescott beaten this year, and I want to have a hand in doing it---simply for the greater glory of the Navy!\"  \"Well,\" grunted Page, \"that's good enough for me.\"  \"We'll trail Soldier Prescott in the dust!\" was a gleeful boast that circulated much through the Naval Academy during the few succeeding days.  Even Dave became infected with it, for he was a loyal Navy man to the very core.  He began to think much of every trick of play that could possibly help to retire Dick Prescott to the background---all for the fame of the Navy and not for the hurt of his friend.  Dave even dreamed of it at night.  As for Dalzell, he caught the infection, proclaiming:  \"We're out, this year, just to beat old Prescott and Holmes!\"  Yet readers of the High School Boys' Series, who know the deep friendship that had existed, and always would, between Prescott and Holmes on the one side, and Darrin and Dalzell, on the other, do not need to be told that this frenzied feeling had in it nothing personal.  \"If you two go on,\" laughed Midshipman Farley, one evening after release, \"you'll both end up with hating your old-time chums.\"  \"Don't you believe it!\" retorted Dave Darrin almost sharply. \"This is just a matter between the two service academies.  What we want is to show the country that the Navy can put up an eleven that can walk all around the Army on Franklin Field.\"  \"A lot the country cares about what we do!\" laughed Page.  \"True,\" admitted Dare.  \"A good many people do seem to forget that there are any such American institutions as the Military and the Naval Academies.  Yet there are thousands of Americans who are patriotic enough to be keenly interested in all that we do.\"  \"This is going to be a bad year for Army friends,\" chuckled Farley.  \"And for the feelings of Cadets Prescott and Holmes,\" added Page with a grimace.  As the practice went on the spirits of the Navy folks went up to fever heat.  It was plain that, this year, the Navy eleven was to make history in the world of sports.  \"Poor old Dick!\" sighed Darrin one day, as the members of the squad were togging to go on to the field.  \"Why?\" Dan demanded.  \"Because, in spite of myself, I find that I am making a personal matter of the whole business.  Dan, I'm obliged to be candid with myself.  It has come to the point that it is Prescott and Holmes that I want to beat!\"  \"Same case here,\" Dan admitted readily.  \"They gave us a trouncing last year, and we're bound to pass it back to 'em.\"  \"I believe I'd really lose all interest in the game, if Dick and Greg didn't play on the Army this year.\"  \"I think I'd feel the same way about it,\" agreed Dan.  \"But never fear---they will play.\"  Two days later Dan finished his bath and dressing, after football practice, to find that Dave had already left ahead of him.  Dan followed to their quarters in Bancroft Hall, to find Dave pacing the floor, the picture of despair.  \"Dan!\" cried Darrin sharply.  \"This letter is from Dick.  He doesn't play this year!\"  \"Don't tell me anything funny, like that, when I've got a cracked lip,\" remonstrated Midshipman Dalzell.  \"Dick doesn't play, I tell you---which means that Greg won't, either.  A lot of boobs at the Military Academy have sent Dick to Coventry for something that he didn't do.  Dan, I don't care a hang about playing this year---we can't beat Prescott and Holmes, for they won't be there!\"     CHAPTER IV  DAVE'S WORK GOES STALE   \"Aye, you're not---not joking?\" demanded Dan Dalzell half piteously.  \"Do you see any signs of mirth in my face?\" demanded Dave Darrin indignantly.  Rap-tap!  Right after the summons Midshipman Farley and Page entered the room.  \"Say, who's dead?\" blurted out Farley, struck by the looks of consternation on the faces of their hosts.  \"Tell him, Dave,\" urged Dan.  \"Prescott and Holmes won't play on this year's Army team,\" stated Darrin.  \"Whoop!\" yelled Farley gleefully.  \"And that was what you're looking so mighty solemn about?  Cheer up, boy!  It's good news.\"  \"Great!\" seconded Midshipman Page with enthusiasm.  \"I tell you, fellows,\" spoke Dave solemnly, \"it takes all the joy out of the Army-Navy game.\"  \"Since when did winning kill joy?\" demanded Farley aghast.  \"Why, with Prescott and Holmes out of it the Navy will get a fit of crowing that will last until after Christmas!\"  \"It makes the victory too cheap,\" contended Darrin.  \"A victory is a victory,\" quoth Midshipman Page, \"and the only fellow who can feel cheap about it is the fellow who doesn't win. Cheer up, Davy.  It's all well enough to wallop a stray college, here and there, but the one victory that sinks in deep and does our hearts good is the one we carry away from the Army.  Whoop! I could cry for joy.\"  \"But why won't Prescott and Holmes play this year?\" asked Farley,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12775"],["title","Dave Darrin's Fourth Year at Annapolis: Headed for Graduation and the Big Cruise (#5)"],["body","face radiant with the satisfaction that the news had given him.  \"Because the corps has sent Prescott to Coventry for something that I'm certain the dear old fellow never did,\" Darrin replied.  \"Lucky accident!\" muttered Farley.  \"But the corps will repent, when they find their football hope gone,\" predicted Page, his face losing much of its hitherto joyous expression.  \"No!  No such luck,\" rejoined Midshipman Darrin.  \"If the brigade, here, sent a fellow to Coventry for what they considered cause, do you mean to tell me that they'd take the fellow out of Coventry just to get a good player on the eleven?\"  \"No, of course, not,\" Page admitted.  \"Then do you imagine that the West Point men are any more lax in their views of corps honor?\" pressed Dave.  \"To be sure they are not---they can't be.\"  \"Then there's only a chance in a thousand that Dick Prescott will, by any lucky accident, be restored to favor in the corps---at least, in time to play on this year's eleven.  If he doesn't play, Holmes simply won't play.  So that takes all the interest out of this year's Army-navy game.\"  \"Not if the Navy wins,\" contended Midshipman Page.  \"Bosh, there's neither profit nor honor in the Navy winning, unless it's against the best men that the Army can put forth,\" retorted Dave Darrin stubbornly.  \"By the great Dewey, I'm afraid nine tenths of my enthusiasm for the game this year has been killed by the miserable news that has come in.\"  Within less than five minutes after the midshipmen had seated themselves around the scores of tables in the mess hall, the news had flown around that Prescott and Holmes were to be counted as out of the Army eleven for this year.  Here and there suppressed cheers greeted the announcement The bulk of the midshipmen, however, were much of Dave Darrin's opinion that there was little glory in beating less than the best team that the Army could really put forth.  \"Darry looks as though he had just got back from a funeral,\" remarked one member of the third class to another youngster.  \"I don't blame him,\" replied the one so addressed.  \"But he's all the more sure of winning over the Army this year.\"  \"I don't believe either of you youngsters know Darrin as well as I do,\" broke in a second classman.  \"What I'm afraid of is, if Prescott and Holmes don't play with the soldiers, then Darry will lose interest in the game to such a degree that even Army dubs will be able to take his shoestrings away from him.  Danny doesn't enjoy fighting fourth-raters.  It's the big game that he enjoys going after.  Why, I'm told that he had simply set his heart on pushing Prescott and Holmes all the way across Franklin Field this year.\"  Readers who are anxious to know why Dick Prescott, one of the finest of American youths, had been sent to Coventry by his comrades at the United States Military Academy, will find it all set forth in the concluding volume of the West Point Series, entitled _\"Dick Prescott's Fourth Year At West Point.\"_  Strangely enough, the first effect of this news from West Point was to send the Navy eleven somewhat \"to the bad.\"  That is to say, Dave Darrin, despite his best endeavors, seemed to go stale from the first hour when he knew that he was not to meet Dick Prescott on the gridiron.  \"Mr. Darrin, what ails you?\" demanded coach kindly, at the end of the second practice game after that.  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"You must brace up.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You seem to have lost all ambition.  No; I won't just say that. But you appear, Mr. Darrin, either to have lost some of your snap or ambition, or else you have gone unaccountably stale.\"  \"I realize my defects, sir, and I am trying very, very hard to overcome them.\"  \"Are you ill at ease over any of your studies?\" persisted coach.  \"No, sir; it seems to me that the fourth year studies are the easiest in the whole course.\"  \"They are not, Mr. Darrin.  But you have had the advantage of three hard years spent in learning how to study, and so your present course appears rather easy to you.  Are you sleeping well?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Eating well?\"  \"Splendid appetite, sir.\"  \"Hm!  I shall soon have a chance to satisfy myself on that point, Mr. Darrin.  The day after to-morrow the team goes to training table.  Have you any idea, Mr. Darrin, what is causing you to make a poorer showing?\"  \"I have had one very great disappointment, sir.  But I'd hate to think that a thing like that could send me stale.\"  \"Oh, a disappointment?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Dave went on frankly.  \"You see, sir, I have been looking forward, most eagerly, to meeting Prescott and downing him with the tricks that Jetson, Dalzell and I have been getting up.\"  \"Oh!  Prescott of the Army team?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I think I heard something about his having been sent to Coventry at the Military Academy.\"  \"But, Mr. Darrin, you are not going to fail us just because the Army loses a worthy player or two?\" exclaimed Lieutenant-Commander Parker in astonishment.  \"Probably that isn't what ails me, sir,\" Dave answered flushing. \"After all, sir, probably I'm just beginning to go stale.  If I can't shake it off no doubt I had better be retired from the Navy eleven.\"  \"Don't you believe it!\" almost shouted coach.  \"Mr. Darrin, you will simply have to brace!  Give us all the best that's in you, and don't for one instant allow any personal disappointments to unfit you.  You'll do that, won't you?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Darrin certainly tried hard enough.  Yet just as certainly the Navy's boosters shook their heads when they watched Darrin's work on the field.  \"He has gone stale,\" they said.  \"The very worst thing that could happen to the Navy this year!\"  Then came the first game of the season---with Lehigh.  Darrin roused himself all he could, and his playing was very nearly up to what might have been expected of him---though not quite.  The visitors got away with a score of eight to five against the Navy.  Next week the Lehighs went to West Point and suffered defeat at the hands of the Army.  The news sent gloom broadcast through the Naval Academy.  \"We get beaten by one of the smaller colleges, that West Point can trim,\" was the mournful comment.  It did, indeed, look bad for the Navy!     CHAPTER V  DAN HANDS HIMSELF BAD MONEY   As the season went on it was evident that Dave Darrin was slowly getting back to form.  Yet coach was not wholly satisfied, nor was anyone else who had the triumph of the Navy eleven at heart.  Three more games had been played, and two of them were won by the Navy.  Next would come Stanford College, a hard lot to beat. The Navy tried to bolster up its own hopes; a loss to Stanford would mean the majority of games lost out of the first five.  True, the news from West Point was not wholly disconcerting to the Navy.  The Army that year had some strong players, it was true; still, the loss of Prescott and Holmes was sorely felt. Word came, too, in indirect ways, that there was no likelihood whatever that the Coventry against Cadet Dick Prescott would be lifted.  It was the evident purpose of the Corps of Cadets, for fancied wrongs, to ostracize Dick Prescott until he found himself forced to resign from the United States Military Academy.  November came in.  Stanford came.  Coach talked to Dave Darrin steadily for ten minutes before the Navy eleven trotted out on to the field.  Stanford left Annapolis with small end of the score, in a six-to-two game, and the Navy was jubilant.  \"Darrin has come back pretty close to his right form,\" was the general comment.  For that Saturday evening Dan Dalzell, being now \"on privilege\" again, asked and received leave to visit in town---this the more readily because his work on the team had prevented his going out of the Yard that afternoon.  Dave, too, requested and secured leave to go into town, though he stated frankly that he had no visit to make, and wanted only a stroll away from the Academy grounds.  Darrin went most of the way to the Prestons.  \"Come right along through, and meet Miss Preston,\" urged Dan.  \"If you ask it as a favor I will, old chap,\" Dave replied.  \"No; I thought the favor would be to you.\"  \"So it would, ordinarily,\" Darrin replied gallantly.  \"But to-night I just want to stroll by myself.\"  \"Ta-ta, then.\" The grin on Dan Dalzell's face as he turned away from his chum was broader than usual.  Dan was thinking that, this time, though his call must be a short one, he would be in no danger on his return.  He could report unconcernedly just before taps.  \"No doughface need apply to-night,\" chuckled Dan.  \"But Davy was surely one awfully good fellow to get me through that other scrape as he did.\"  All thought of football fled from Dan Dalzell's brain as he pulled the bellknob at the Preston house.  After all this was to be but the third meeting.  Dan fancied, however, that absence had made his heart fonder.  Since the night when he had Frenched it over the wall Dan had received two notes from Miss Preston, in answer to his own letters, but the last note was now ten days' old.  \"May I see Mrs. Preston?\" asked Dan, as a colored servant opened the door and admitted him.  This was Dan's correct idea of the way to call on a young woman to whom he was not engaged, but half hoped to be, some day.  The colored maid soon came back.  \"Mrs. Preston is so very busy, sah, that she asks to be excused, sah,\" reported the servant, coming into the parlor where Dan sat on the edge of a chair.  \"But Mistah Preston will be down right away, sah.\"  A moment later a heavier step was heard on the stairway.  Then May Preston's uncle came into the parlor.  \"You will pardon Mrs. Preston not coming down stairs to-night, I know, Mr. Dalzell,\" said the man of the house, as he and the midshipman shook hands.  \"The truth is, we are very much occupied to-night.\"  \"I had not dreamed of it, or I would not have called,\" murmured Dan reddening.  \"I trust you will pardon me.\"  \"There is no need of pardon, for you have not offended,\" smiled Mr. Preston.  \"I shall be very glad to"]]]
