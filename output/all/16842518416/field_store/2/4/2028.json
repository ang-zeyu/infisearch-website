Jim Ferrers was in the lead, his trained eyes searching the ground for the trail of the tents.  Within five minutes the party came upon the tents and the food supplies, all of which had been dumped into a thicket in confused piles.  \"We'll sort this out and get it back to camp,\" Tom proposed. \"Alf, little hero, redeem yourself by buckling down to a good load.  Come here; let me load you down.\"  Alf meekly submitted, cherishing a half hope that he would not be discharged from his new position after all.  At the end of an hour the stuff had all been taken back and the camp looked a good deal as it had looked that morning.  \"Now, Alf,\" directed Tom in a milder, kinder tone, \"you hustle over and break your back helping Mr. Ferrers to get supper ready. We're a famished lot.  Understand?\"  Alf was only too glad to be able to understand that his part in the dismantling of the camp had been overlooked.  While Tom and Harry led their guests into one of the tents, young Drew hastened over to where Jim Ferrers was starting a fire in the camp stove.  \"Now, put that stuff back in your pockets, or I'll throw it in the fire!\" sounded the angry voice of Ferrers.  \"You can't use any of that stuff when you're working around me.\"  \"The poor little cigarette pest must have been trying to use his newly acquired 'makings,'\" grinned Tom.  While Ferrers was thus busied with preparation of the meal, Joe Timmins had taken the guide's rifle and was keeping a watchful eye over the approaches to the neighborhood.  \"So you young men think you could serve me satisfactorily as engineers,\" questioned Mr. Dunlop.  \"I think we could,\" Tom answered.  \"But I am afraid you young men have a rather large notion as to the pay you're worth,\" continued the mine promoter.  \"That's right, sir,\" Reade nodded.  \"We have a good-sized idea on the pay question.  Now, when you go to Dugout City next you might wire the president of the S.B. & L. railroad, at Denver, or the president of the A.G. & N.M., at Tucson, Arizona, and ask those gentlemen whether we are in the habit of making good on large pay.\"  \"How much will you young men want?\"  \"For work of this character,\" replied Tom, after a few moments of thought, during which Harry Hazelton was silent, \"we shall want six hundred dollars a month, each, with two hundred dollars apiece added for the fighting risk.\"  \"The fighting risk?\" questioned Mr. Dunlop.  \"Well, we shall have Dolph Gage and his crowd to guard against, won't we?\" Reads counter-questioned.  \"But such pay is absurd!\" he protested.  \"From your view-point, very likely, sir.  From our view-point it will be very ordinary compensation, and nothing but our desire to learn more about mining will tempt us to go into it at the figure we have named.\"  \"Your price puts your services out of the question for my company,\" replied Mr. Dunlop, with a shake of his head.  \"Very good, sir,\" Tom rejoined pleasantly.  \"No harm done, and we need not talk it over any more.  We wish you good luck in finding proper engineers for your work.  You will probably motor back to Dugout tomorrow morning, won't you?\"  \"We'll have to,\" Mr. Dunlop answered.  \"We're not safe here until we hire a few good men to come out here to keep Gage and his fellows at a distance.\"  \"That's true, sir,\" Tom nodded.  \"As you'll need a good many men here by the time you start work on your mine you'll do well to bring at least a score of them down at once.  Twenty good, rough men, used to this life and not afraid of bullets, ought to make you feel wholly safe and secure on your own property.\"  There was more talk, but neither Tom nor Harry again referred to their serving the new company as engineers.  In due course of time Jim Ferrers, with such help as Alf was able to give, had supper ready to serve.  It was a rough meal, of hard tack, pilot bread, potatoes, canned meats and vegetables, but outdoor life had given all a good appetite and the meal did not long remain on the camp table.  For guard duty that night it was arranged that Jim Ferrers and Joe Timmins should relieve each other.  Tom also offered to stay up with Ferrers, Harry taking the watch trick with Timmins, though neither of the young engineers was armed or cared to be.  Harry and Timmins were to take the first watch.  The others retired early.  Tom Reade was about to begin undressing when Hazelton came in for a moment.  While the chums were chatting, Alf Drew's forlorn figure showed at the doorway of the tent.  \"Say, boss,\" complained Alf, \"I haven't any place to sleep.\"  \"What?\" Reade demanded in pretended surprise, \"with nearly all the ground in Nevada at your disposal?\"  \"But that isn't a bed,\" contended Alf.  \"Right you are there, lad\" agreed Tom.  \"Now, see here, boss, only one of you two is going to sleep at a time tonight.  I'm tired---I ache.  Why can't I sleep on the other cot in this tent?\"  \"Come here,\" ordered Tom.  Alf wonderingly advanced.  Whiff! whiff! moved the young engineer's nostrils.  \"Just as I thought,\" sighed Reade.  \"You've been smoking cigarettes without any let-up ever since supper.\"  \"Well, I have ter,\" argued Drew.  \"And now you smell as fragrant as a gas-house, Alf.  Mr. Hazelton is rather particular about the little matter of cleanliness. If you were to sleep on his cot the smell of cigarettes would be so strong that I don't believe Mr. Hazelton could stay on his cot when it came his time to turn in.\"  \"But say!  If you knew how dead, dog-tired I am!\" moaned Alf.  \"Oh, let him sleep on my cot,\" interposed Harry, good-heartedly. \"If I can't stand the cot when I come to use it, then it won't be the first night that I've slept on hard ground and rested well.\"  \"All right, Alf, climb in,\" nodded Tom.  \"But see here.  Cigarettes make you as nervous as a lunatic.  If you have any bad dreams tonight, and begin yelling, then I'll rise and throw you outdoors. Do you understand?\"  \"Yes,\" mumbled the boy.  \"But I won't dream.  I'm not nervous now.  It's only when I can't get enough cigs that I'm nervous.\"  \"You should have seen him this afternoon,\" Tom continued, turning to his chum.  \"The lad and I took a walk.  At every other step he kept imagining that he heard rattlesnakes rattling.\"  \"And I did, too,\" contended Alf stoutly.  \"You know I did.  You heard 'em yourself, Mr. Reade.\"  \"I didn't hear a single rattler,\" Tom replied soberly.  \"Let the tired little fellow go to bed in peace,\" urged Harry.  \"All right,\" Tom agreed.  Alf went to the head of the cot, to turn the blanket down from the head.  Click-ick-ick-ick!  came the warning sound.  With a yell of terror Alf Drew bounded back.  \"There's another rattler,\" he screamed.  \"It's under that blanket.\"  \"It's all your nerves,\" Tom retorted.  \"There isn't a rattler within miles of here.\"  \"Didn't you hear a rattle, Mr. Reade?\" wailed the cigarette fiend.  \"No; I didn't.\"  \"Didn't you, Mr. Hazelton?\"  Harry was on the point of answering \"yes,\" but Tom caught his eyes, and Harry, knowing that something was up, shook his head.  \"You must both be deaf, then,\" argued Drew.  \"Why, see here, you nervous little wreck of a cigarette,\" said Tom, grinning good-humoredly, \"I'll show you that there is no snake in that bed.  Watch me.\"  With utmost unconcern, Tom took hold of the blanket, stripping it from the cot.  Then he ran his hands over the under blanket.  \"Not a thing in this bed but what belongs here,\" Tom explained. \"Alf, do you see how cigarettes are taking the hinges off your nerves.\"  Shame-faced, and believing that Tom was right, Alf advanced toward the cot.  As he reached the side of it-----  Click-ick-ick! sounded close to him.  \"You can't make me stay in this tent.  It's the most dangerous spot in Nevada,\" cried Drew, turning and fleeing into flee open. The two chums could hear his feet as he sped to another part of the camp.  \"Some trick about that rattling?\" queried Harry in a whisper.  \"Of course,\" Tom admitted with a wink.  \"It's a shame to tease the youngster so.\"  \"It would be,\" Tom assented rather gravely, \"but I'm using that means to make the lad afraid to smoke cigarettes.  If young Drew goes on smoking the miserable little things he'll become come a physical wreck inside of a year.\"  \"How do you do the trick, anyway?\" asked Harry curiously.  \"Does it really sound like the click of a rattler?\" asked Tom.  \"Does it?  I was 'stung' almost as badly as poor Alf was.  How do you do the trick?\"  \"I'll show you, some time,\" nodded Tom Reade.  With that promise Harry had to be content, and so must the reader, for the present.  Hazelton went out to stand first watch with Joe Timmins.  Alf Drew, finding that the Dunlop party had no room for him under the shelter they had rigged from the rear of the automobile, curled himself on the ground under a tree and fitfully wooed sleep. By daylight the little fellow was fretfully awake, his \"nerves\" refusing him further rest until he had rolled and smoked two cigarettes. By the time the smoke was over Jim Ferrers called to him to help start the breakfast.  Nothing had been seen of the four intruders through the night.  \"I think we shall try to get safely through to Dugout City this morning,\" suggested Mr. Dunlop.  \"You'll make it all right, if you have gasoline enough,\" remarked Ferrers, who hovered close at hand with a frying pan filled with crisp bacon.  \"You don't believe Gage will try to attack us on the way?\"  \"He has no call to,\" replied Ferrers.  \"You're obeying him by leaving the claim, aren't you?\"  \"Then probably Gage and his companions will settle down on the claim after we leave,\" suggested Mr. Dunlop.  \"If Gage tries to jump the claim in your absence,\" proposed Ferrers, \"your course is easy.  If you have the legal right to the claim you'll have to bring back force enough to drive those hyenas off.\"  \"Will you people try to keep an eye over the claim while I'm gone?\" asked Mr. Dunlop.  \"That would be a little out of our line,\" Tom made reply.  \"Besides, Mr. Dunlop, I'm not at all sure that we shall be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12777"],["title","The Young Engineers in Nevada; Or, Seeking Fortune on the Turn of a Pick (#7)"],["body","until you return.\"  \"But we haven't settled, Reade, whether you and your partner are to be our engineers at the Bright Hope Mine.\"  \"Quite true, sir,\" nodded Tom.  \"On the other hand, you haven't engaged us, either\"  \"Won't you keep the matter open until our return?\"  \"That would be hardly good business, Mr. Dunlop.\"  \"Yet suppose I had engaged you,\"  \"Then we'd be going back to Dugout City with you.\"  \"Why, Reade?\"  \"So that we might get in touch with the world and find out whether you are financially responsible.  We wouldn't take an engagement without being reasonably sure of our money.\"  \"You're a sharp one,\" laughed Mr. Dunlop.  Yet he made no further reference to engaging the two young engineers, a fact that Reade was keen enough to note.  Within an hour after breakfast the Dunlop ear pulled out, leaving Tom Reade with only his own party.  \"What our friend wants,\" smiled Harry, \"is a pair of mining engineers at the salary of one mere surveyor.\"  \"He won't pay any more than he has to,\" rejoined Reade.  \"Do you really want to work for Dunlop?\"  \"I really don't care a straw whether I do or not,\" was Tom's answer. \"Harry, we're in the very heart of the gold country and we don't need to work for copper pennies.\"  \"If you'll allow me to say so, friends,\" put in Jim Ferrers, \"I believe you two are the original pair with long heads and I'm going to stick to you as long as you'll let me.\"  \"Me, too,\" piped up Alf Drew ungrammatically.  The young cigarette fiend was at that instant engaged in rolling one of his paper abominations.  Click-ick-ick-ick!  \"Rattlers again!\" shivered Alf.  Paper and tobacco fell from his fingers and he fled in terror.     CHAPTER VI  TOM CATCHES THE \"NEVADA FEVER\"   Two nights passed without adventure.  On each of these nights the three campers---for Alf didn't \"count\" divided the hours of darkness into three watches, each standing guard in his turn. On the third morning after the departure of the Bright Hope group the campers were seated at breakfast around the packing case that served as table.  \"I feel as though we ought to be at work,\" suggested Hazelton.  \"Good!\" mocked Tom.  \"You've been riding every day lately, and I have remained in camp, testing samples of ore that I've picked up on my strolls.\"  \"You take the horse today,\" proposed Harry, \"and I'll stay in camp and work.\"  \"Suppose both of us stay in and work,\" proposed Reade.  \"That'll be all right, too,\" nodded Harry, pleasantly.  \"May I ask, Tom, what you're up to, anyway?\"  \"Yes,\" Reade smiled.  \"If the Bright Hope is a real mine there must be other good property in this region.  I've been looking about, and making an assay every now and then.  Jim, you've prospected a bit, haven't you?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded the guide.  \"And, gentlemen, in my day I've been sole owner of three claims, each one of which panned out a fortune.\"  \"Great!\" glowed Harry.  \"But how did you lose your money, Jim!\"  \"I never got a cent out of any of the mines,\" rejoined the guide grimly.  \"How did that happen?\"  \"Did you ever hear of 'square gamblers'?\" inquired Ferrers.  \"Some,\" Tom admitted with a grimace.  \"We ran up against one of that brood in Arizona, eh, Harry?\"  \"You didn't play against him, I hope, hinted Jim soberly.  \"Yes, we did,\" admitted Tom.  \"Not with his own marked cards, though, nor with any kind of cards.  We met him with men's weapons, and it is necessary to add that our 'square gambler' lost.\"  \"The 'square gamblers' that I met didn't lose,\" sighed Jim Ferrers. \"They won, and that's why all three of my mines passed out of my hands before they began to pay.\"  \"You must know something about ore and croppings, and the like, Jim?\", Tom continued.  \"In a prospector's way, yes,\" Ferrers admitted.  \"Then we'll take a walk, now.  Alf can wash up the dishes.\"  \"It's all the little wretch is fit for,\" muttered Ferrers contemptuously.  Jim looked carefully into the magazine of his repeating ride, then saw to it that his ammunition belt was filled.  \"Ready when you gentlemen are,\" he announced.  \"Say, won't you take me with you?\" pleaded Alf.  \"You wouldn't be of any use to us,\" Reade answered.  \"But I---I am afraid to stay here alone.\"  \"Do you believe yourself to be so valuable that any one will want to steal you?\" Tom laughed.  Alf made a wry face and watched the others depart.  Then, filled with needless alarm, he crawled out into a thicket and hid himself. He didn't mean to be trapped by prowlers!  Tom led the way for nearly a mile.  At last the trio climbed a slight ascent, halting at the top of the ridge.  \"You see, Jim,\" Tom explained, \"this ridge runs southwesterly from here.\"  \"I see it does?\" nodded the guide.  \"Now, to the northeastward I don't believe there are any croppings that look good enough.  But just keep along to the southeast, picking up a specimen here and there.  Some of the rock looks good to me.\"  Jim Ferrers didn't answer in words, though his eyes gleamed with the old fever that he had known before.  \"Here's a pretty piece of stone,\" called the guide in a low tone. He stood holding a fragment about as big as his two fists.  \"It's streaked\" pretty well with yellow, you see, gentlemen,\" he remarked;  \"It is,\" Tom agreed, taking the specimen.  \"Does the vein run with the top of the ridge?\" demanded Harry eagerly.  \"It runs a little more to eastward, from this point, I think,\" Tom made answer.  \"But let us walk along, in three parallel lines, and see who finds the best indications.\"  By noon all three were fairly tired out by the steep climbing over the rocky ground.  Each had as many specimens as he could carry.  The result of the exploration had tended to confirm Tom's notion as to where the vein lay.  \"Now, let's see about where we'd stake the claim,\" Tom proposed. \"Of course, we want to get the best rock obtainable.  We don't want to leave the best part of this slope for some one else to stake out.  It seems to me that the claim ought to start up by that blasted tree.  What do you say, Jim?\"  \"Well, I don't like to make mistakes where you young gentleman are concerned,\" Ferrers answered, taking off his felt hat and scratching his head.  \"You see, it isn't my claim.\"  \"The dickens it isn't!\" Reade retorted.  \"Why, you---you gentlemen didn't plan to take me in, did you,\" asked Ferrers, opening his eyes very wide in his amazement over the idea.  \"You see I---I can't contribute my share of the brains, along with a pair like you,\" continued the guide.  \"Look at you two---engineers already!  Then look at me---more'n twice as old as either of you, and yet I'm only a cook.\"  \"You're an honest man, aren't you, Jim?\" demanded Reade.  \"Why, there's some folks who say I am,\" Ferrers slowly admitted.  \"And we're among those who believe that way,\" Tom continued. \"Now, Jim, you're with us, and you've every right to be a partner if we find anything worth taking up in the mine line.\"  \"But there ain't no sense in it,\" protested the guide, his voice shaking with emotion.  \"You don't need me.\"  \"We need a man of your kind, Jim,\" Tom rejoined, resting a very friendly hand on the guide's shoulder.  \"Listen to me.  Hazelton and I are engineers first of all.  We'd sooner be engineers than kings.  Now, the lure of gold is all well enough, and we're human enough to like money.  Yet a really big engineering chance would take us away from a gold mine almost any day in the year.  Eh, Harry!\"  \"I'm afraid it would,\" confirmed Hazelton.  \"If we left a paying mine, Jim, what would we want?\" Tom continued. \"We'd want an honest partner, wouldn't we---one whom we could leave for six months or a year and still be able to depend on getting our share of the profits of the mine.  You've gambled in the past, Jim, but you stopped that years ago.  Now you're honest and safe.  Do you begin to see, Jim Ferrers, where you come in?  Another point.  How old do you take us to be?\"  \"Well, you're more than twenty-one, each of you,\" replied Ferrers.  \"Not quite, as yet,\" Tom answered.  \"So, you see, in order to take out a claim we'd need a guardian, and one whom we could depend upon not to rob us.  Jim, if we're to take up a mine we must have a third man in with us.  Do you know a man anywhere who'd use us more honestly than you would?\"  \"I don't,\" exclaimed Jim Ferrers.  \"At the same time, gentlemen, I know your kind well enough.  Both of you talk of fighting as though you dreaded it, but I'll tell you, gentlemen, that I wouldn't _dare_ to try any nasty tricks on either of you.\"  \"We understand each other, then,\" Tom nodded.  \"Now, then, let us try to make up our minds just where we would want to stake off this claim if the gold assays as well as it looks.\"  At the beginning Tom and Harry built a little pile of stones. Then, by mere pacing they laid off what they judged to be the fifteen hundred feet of length which the government allows to a single mining claim.  \"We can attend to the proper width later,\" suggested Tom.  \"Now, what do you say if we make for camp at once.  I'm not hungry; still, I think I could eat my half of a baked ox.\"  The instant that the trio reached camp, Jim Ferrers, with an unwonted mist in his eyes, began to juggle the cooking utensils.  Tom busied himself with building the best fire that he could under the chamber of the assaying furnace, while Harry Hazelton, rolling up his sleeves, began to demonstrate his muscle by pulverizing little piles of ore in a hand-mill.  \"Be careful not to mix the lots, Harry,\" advised Tom, glancing over from his station by the furnace.  \"Thanks for the caution,\" smiled Hazelton.  \"But I have just enough intelligence left to understand the value of knowing from what section of the slope each particular lot of rock comes.\"  Dinner was eaten in silence.  For one thing the campers were ravenously hungry.  In the second place, though each kept as quiet as possible, he was deep in the thrall of the fever to dig up hidden gold.  The meal was nearly over when Alf Drew came into camp.  \"Are you leaving anything to"]]]
