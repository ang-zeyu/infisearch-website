German efficiency in Germany is far greater than English efficiency in England; the Germans were better fed, had more amusements and leisure, less crushing poverty than the English. But would any Englishman therefore desire to see Germans occupying all the highest positions in England? Why not? Because the righteous self-respect and dignity of the free man revolt against foreign domination, however superior. As Mr. Asquith said at the beginning of the War, such a condition was “inconceivable and would be intolerable.” Why then is it the one conceivable system here in India? Why is it not felt by all Indians to be intolerable? It is because it has become a habit, bred in us from childhood, to regard the sahib-log as our natural superiors, and the greatest injury British rule has done to Indians is to deprive them of the natural instinct born in all free peoples, the feeling of an inherent right to Self-determination, to be themselves. Indian dress, Indian food, Indian ways, Indian customs, are all looked on as second-rate; Indian mother-tongue and Indian literature cannot make an educated man. Indians as well as Englishmen take it for granted that the natural rights of every Nation do not belong to them; they claim “a larger share in the government of the country,” instead of claiming the government of their own country, and they are expected to feel grateful for “boons,” for concessions. Britain is to say what she will give. The whole thing is wrong, topsy-turvy, irrational. Thank God that India’s eyes are opening; that myriads of her people realise that they are men, with a man’s right to freedom in his own country, a man’s right to manage his own affairs. India is no longer on her knees for boons; she is on her feet for Rights. It is because I have taught this that the English in India misunderstand me and call me seditious; it is because I have taught this that I am President of this Congress to-day.  This may seem strong language, because the plain truth is not usually put in India. But this is what every Briton feels in Britain for his own country, and what every Indian should feel in India for his. This is the Freedom for which the Allies are fighting; this is Democracy, the Spirit of the Age. And this is what every true Briton will feel is India’s Right the moment India claims it for herself, as she is claiming it now. When this right is gained, then will the tie between India and Great Britain become a golden link of mutual love and service, and the iron chain of a foreign yoke will fall away. We shall live and work side by side, with no sense of distrust and dislike, working as brothers for common ends. And from that union shall arise the mightiest Empire, or rather Commonwealth, that the world has ever known, a Commonwealth that, in God’s good time, shall put an end to War.   II. THE SECONDARY REASONS.  Tests of Efficiency.  The Secondary Reasons for the present demand for Home Rule may be summed up in the blunt statement: “The present rule, while efficient in less important matters and in those which concern British interests, is inefficient in the greater matters on which the healthy life and happiness of the people depend.” Looking at outer things, such as external order, posts and telegraphs--except where political agitators are concerned--main roads, railways, etc., foreign visitors, who expected to find a semi-savage country, hold up their hands in admiration. But if they saw the life of the people, the masses of struggling clerks trying to educate their children on Rs. 25 (28s. 0-1/4d.) a month, the masses of labourers with one meal a day, and the huts in which they live, they would find cause for thought. And if the educated men talked freely with them, they would be surprised at their bitterness. Gopal Krishna Gokhale put the whole matter very plainly in 1911:       One of the fundamental conditions of the peculiar position of      the British Government in this country is that it should be a      continuously progressive Government. I think all thinking men,      to whatever community they belong, will accept that. Now, I      suggest four tests to judge whether the Government is      progressive, and, further, whether it is continuously      progressive. The first test that I would apply is what measures      it adopts for the moral and material improvement of the mass of      the people, and under these measures I do not include those      appliances of modern Governments which the British Government      has applied in this country, because they were appliances      necessary for its very existence, though they have benefited      the people, such as the construction of Railways, the      introduction of Post and Telegraphs, and things of that kind.      By measures for the moral and material improvement of the      people, I mean what the Government does for education, what the      Government does for sanitation, what the Government does for      agricultural development, and so forth. That is my first test.      The second test that I would apply is what steps the Government      takes to give us a larger share in the administration of our      local affairs--in municipalities and local boards. My third      test is what voice the Government gives us in its Councils--in      those deliberate assemblies, where policies are considered.      And, lastly, we must consider how far Indians are admitted into      the ranks of the public service.  A Change of System Needed.  Those were Gokhale’s tests, and Indians can supply the results of their knowledge and experience to answer them. But before dealing with the failure to meet these tests, it is necessary to state here that it is not a question of blaming men, or of substituting Indians for Englishmen, but of changing the system itself. It is a commonplace that the best men become corrupted by the possession of irresponsible power. As Bernard Houghton says: “The possession of unchecked power corrupts some of the finer qualities.” Officials quite honestly come to believe that those who try to change the system are undermining the security of the State. They identify the State with themselves, so that criticism of them is seen as treason to the State. The phenomenon is well known in history, and it is only repeating itself in India. The same writer--I prefer to use his words rather than my own, for he expresses exactly my own views, and will not be considered to be prejudiced as I am thought to be--cogently remarks:       He (the official) has become an expert in reports and returns      and matters of routine through many years of practice. They are      the very woof and warp of his brain. He has no ideas, only      reflexes. He views with acrid disfavour untried conceptions.      From being constantly preoccupied with the manipulation of the      machine he regards its smooth working, the ordered and      harmonious regulation of glittering pieces of machinery, as the      highest service he can render to the country of his adoption.      He determines that his particular cog-wheel at least shall be      bright, smooth, silent, and with absolutely no back-lash. Not      unnaturally in course of time he comes to envisage the world      through the strait embrasure of an office window. When perforce      he must report on new proposals he will place in the forefront,      not their influence on the life and progress of the people, but      their convenience to the official hierarchy and the manner in      which they affect its authority. Like the monks of old, or the      squire in the typical English village, he cherishes a      benevolent interest in the commonalty, and is quite willing,      even eager, to take a general interest in their welfare, if      only they do not display initiative or assert themselves in      opposition to himself or his order. There is much in this      proviso. Having come to regard his own judgment as almost      divine, and the hierarchy of which he has the honour to form a      part as a sacrosanct institution, he tolerates the laity so      long as they labour quietly and peaceably at their vocations      and do not presume to inter-meddle in high matters of State.      That is the heinous offence. And frank criticism of official      acts touches a lower depth still, even _lèse majesté_. For no      official will endure criticism from his subordinates, and the      public, who lie in outer darkness beyond the pale, do not in      his estimation rank even with his subordinates. How, then,      should he listen with patience when in their cavilling way they      insinuate that, in spite of the labours of a high-souled      bureaucracy, all is perhaps not for the best in the best of all      possible worlds--still less when they suggest reforms that had      never occurred even to him or to his order, and may clash with      his most cherished ideals? It is for the officials to govern      the country; they alone have been initiated into the sacred      mysteries; they alone understand the secret working of the      machine. At the utmost the laity may tender respectful and      humble suggestions for their consideration, but no more. As for      those who dare to think and act for themselves, their ignorant      folly is only equalled by their arrogance. It is as though a      handful of schoolboys were to dictate to their masters      alterations in the traditional time-table, or to insist on a      modified curriculum.... These worthy people [officials] confuse      manly independence with disloyalty; they cannot conceive of      natives except either as rebels or as timid sheep.  Non-Official Anglo-Indians.  The problem becomes more complicated by the existence in India of a small but powerful body of the same race as the higher officials; there are only 122,919 English-born persons in this country, while there are 245,000,000"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12820"],["title","The Case for India (#8)"],["body"," in the British Raj and another 70,000,000 in the Indian States, more or less affected by British influence. As a rule, the non-officials do not take any part in politics, being otherwise occupied; but they enter the field when any hope arises in Indian hearts of changes really beneficial to the Nation. John Stuart Mill observed on this point:       The individuals of the ruling people who resort to the foreign      country to make their fortunes are of all others those who most      need to be held under powerful restraint. They are always one      of the chief difficulties of the Government. Armed with the      prestige and filled with the scornful overbearingness of the      conquering Nation, they have the feelings inspired by absolute      power without its sense of responsibility.  Similarly, Sir John Lawrence wrote:       The difficulty in the way of the Government of India acting      fairly in these matters is immense. If anything is done, or      attempted to be done, to help the natives, a general howl is      raised, which reverberates in England, and finds sympathy and      support there. I feel quite bewildered sometimes what to do.      Everyone is, in the abstract, for justice, moderation, and      suchlike excellent qualities; but when one comes to apply such      principles so as to affect anybody’s interests, then a change      comes over them.  Keene, speaking of the principle of treating equally all classes of the community, says:       The application of that maxim, however, could not be made      without sometimes provoking opposition among the handful of      white settlers in India who, even when not connected with the      administration, claimed a kind of class ascendancy which was      not only in the conditions of the country but also in the      nature of the case. It was perhaps natural that in a land of      caste the compatriots of the rulers should become--as Lord      Lytton said--a kind of “white Brahmanas”; and it was certain      that, as a matter of fact, the pride of race and the possession      of western civilisation created a sense of superiority, the      display of which was ungraceful and even dangerous, when not      tempered by official responsibility. This feeling had been      sensitive enough in the days of Lord William Bentinck, when the      class referred to was small in numbers and devoid of influence.      It was now both more numerous, and--by reason of its connection      with the newspapers of Calcutta and of London--it was far      better able to make its passion heard.  During Lord Ripon’s sympathetic administration the great outburst occurred against the Ilbert Bill in 1883. We are face to face with a similar phenomenon to-day, when we see the European Associations--under the leadership of the _Madras Mail_, the _Englishman_ of Calcutta, the _Pioneer of_ Allahabad, the _Civil and Military Gazette_ of Lahore, with their Tory and Unionist allies in the London Press and with the aid of retired Indian officials and non-officials in England--desperately resisting the Reforms now proposed. Their opposition, we know, is a danger to the movement towards Freedom, and even when they have failed to impress England--as they are evidently failing--they will try to minimise or smother here the reforms which a statute has embodied. The Minto-Morley reforms were thus robbed of their usefulness, and a similar attempt, if not guarded against, will be made when the Congress-League Scheme is used as the basis for an Act.  The Re-action on England.  We cannot leave out of account here the deadly harm done to England herself by this un-English system of rule in India. Mr. Hobson has pointed out:       As our free Self-Governing Colonies have furnished hope,      encouragement, and leading to the popular aspirations in Great      Britain, not merely by practical success in the art of      Self-Government, but by the wafting of a spirit of freedom and      equality, so our despotically ruled Dependencies have ever      served to damage the character of our people by feeding the      habits of snobbish subservience, the admiration of wealth and      rank, the corrupt survivals of the inequalities of      feudalism.... Cobden writing in 1860 of our Indian Empire, put      this pithy question: “Is it not just possible that we may      become corrupted at home by the reaction of arbitrary political      maxims in the East upon our domestic politics, just as Greece      and Rome were demoralised by their contact with Asia?” Not      merely is the reaction possible, it is inevitable. As the      despotic portion of our Empire, has grown in area, a large      number of men, trained in the temper and methods of autocracy,      as soldiers and civil officials in our Crown Colonies,      Protectorates and Indian Empire, reinforced by numbers of      merchants, planters, engineers, and overseers, whose lives have      been those of a superior caste living an artificial life      removed from all the healthy restraints of ordinary European      Society, have returned to this country, bringing back the      characters, sentiments and ideas imposed by this foreign      environment.  It is a little hard on the I.C.S. that they should be foreigners here, and then, when they return to their native land, find that they have become foreigners there by the corrupting influences with which they are surrounded here. We import them as raw material to our own disadvantage, and when we export them as manufactured here, Great Britain and India alike suffer from their reactionary tendencies. The results are unsatisfactory to both sides.  The First Test Applied.  Let us now apply Gokhale’s first test. What has the Bureaucracy done for “education, sanitation, agricultural improvement, and so forth”? I must put the facts very briefly, but they are indisputable.  _Education_. The percentage to the whole population of children receiving education is 2.8, the percentage having risen by 0.9 since Mr. Gokhale moved his Education Bill six years ago. The percentage of children of school-going age attending school is 18.7. In 1913 the Government of India put the number of pupils at 4-1/2 millions; this has been accomplished in 63 years, reckoning from Sir Charles Wood’s Educational Despatch in 1854, which led to the formation of the Education Department. In 1870 an Education Act was passed in Great Britain, the condition of Education in England then much resembling our present position; grants-in-aid in England had been given since 1833, chiefly to Church Schools. Between 1870 and 1881 free and compulsory education was established, and in 12 years the attendance rose from 43.3 to nearly 100 per cent. There are now 6,000,000 children in the schools of England and Wales out of a population of 40 millions. Japan, before 1872, had a proportion of 28 per cent. of children of school-going age in school, nearly 10 over our present proportion; in 24 years the percentage was raised to 92, and in 28 years education was free and compulsory. In Baroda education is free and largely compulsory and the percentage of boys is 100 per cent. Travancore has 81.1 per cent. of boys and 33.2 of girls. Mysore has 45.8 of boys and 9.7 of girls. Baroda spends an. 6-6 per head on school-going children, British India one anna. Expenditure on education advanced between 1882 and 1907 by 57 lakhs. Land-revenue had increased by 8 crores, military expenditure by 13 crores, civil by 8 crores, and capital outlay on railways was 15 crores. (I am quoting G.K. Gokhale’s figures.) He ironically calculated that, if the population did not increase, every boy would be in school 115 years hence, and every girl in 665 years. Brother Delegates, we hope to do it more quickly under Home Rule. I submit that in Education the Bureaucracy is inefficient.  _Sanitation and Medical Relief_. The prevalence of plague, cholera, and above all malaria, shows the lack of sanitation alike in town and country. This lack is one of the causes contributing to the low average life-period in India--23.5 years. In England the life-period is 40 years, in New Zealand 60. The chief difficulty in the way of the treatment of disease is the encouragement of the foreign system of medicine, especially in rural parts, and the withholding of grants from the indigenous. Government Hospitals, Government Dispensaries, Government doctors, must all be on the foreign system. Ayurvaidic and Unani medicines, Hospitals, Dispensaries, Physicians, are unrecognised, and to “cover” the latter is “infamous” conduct. Travancore gives grants-in-aid to 72 Vaidyashalas, at which 143,505 patients--22,000 more than in allopathic institutions--were treated in 1914-15 (the Report issued in 1917). Our Government cannot grapple with the medical needs of the people, yet will not allow the people’s money to be spent on the systems they prefer. Under Home Rule the indigenous and the foreign systems will be treated with impartiality. I grant that the allopathic doctors do their utmost to supply the need, and show great self-sacrifice, but the need is too vast and the numbers too few. Efficiency on their own lines in this matter is therefore impossible for our bureaucratic Government; their fault lies in excluding the indigenous systems, which they have not condescended to examine before rejecting them. The result is that in sanitation and medical relief the Bureaucracy is inefficient.  _Agricultural Development_. The census of 1911 gives the agricultural population at 218.3 millions. Its frightful poverty is a matter of common knowledge; its ever-increasing load of indebtedness has been dwelt on for at least the last thirty odd years by Sir Dinshaw E. Wacha. Yet the increasing debt is accompanied with increasing taxation, land revenue having risen, as just stated, in 25 years, by 8 crores--80,000,000--of rupees. In addition to this there are local cesses, salt tax, etc. The salt tax, which presses most hardly on "]]]
