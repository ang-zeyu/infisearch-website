Yes, the only price he asked him was to stand the beast a drink.    He was cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.    So the mining speculator made the bargain, proudly thinking    He had bested old Mahomet, he had done him in the eye.   Then he clambered on the camel, and the while the beast was drinking    He explained with satisfaction to the miners standing by   That 'twas cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.    But the camel kept on drinking and he filled his hold with water,    And the more he had inside him yet the more he seemed to need;   For he drank it by the gallon, and his girths grew taut and tauter,    And the miners muttered softly, “Yes, he's very dry indeed!   But he's cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.”    So he drank up twenty buckets--it was weird to watch him suck it,    (And the market price for water was per bucket half-a-crown)   Till the speculator stopped him, saying, “Not another bucket--    If I give him any more there'll be a famine in the town.   Take him back to old Mahomet, and I'll tramp it through the town.”     He was cheap, very cheap, as the speculators go.    There's a moral to this story--in your hat you ought to paste it,    Be careful whom you shout for when a camel is about,   And there's plenty human camels who, before they'll see you waste it,    Will drink up all you pay for if you're fool enough to shout;   If you chance to strike a camel when you're fool enough to shout,    You'll be cheap, very cheap, as the speculators go.     The Lost Drink      I had spent the night in the watch-house--    My head was the size of three--   So I went and asked the chemist    To fix up a drink for me;   And he brewed it from various bottles    With soda and plenty of ice,   With something that smelt like lemon,    And something that seemed like spice.    It fell on my parching palate    Like the dew on a sun-baked plain,   And my system began to flourish    Like the grass in a soft spring rain;   It wandered throughout my being,    Suffusing my soul with rest,   And I felt as I “scoffed” that liquid    That life had a new-found zest.    I have been on the razzle-dazzle    Full many a time since then   But I never could get the chemist    To brew me that drink again.   He says he's forgotten the notion--    'Twas only by chance it came--   He's tried me with various liquids    But oh! they are not the same.    We have sought, but we sought it vainly,    That one lost drink divine;   We have sampled his various bottles,    But somehow they don't combine:   Yet I know when I cross the River    And stand on the Golden Shore   I shall meet with an angel-chemist    Who'll brew me that drink once more.     Mulligan's Mare      Oh, Mulligan's bar was the deuce of a place   To drink and to fight, and to gamble and race;   The height of choice spirits from near and from far   Were all concentrated on Mulligan's bar.    There was “Jerry the Swell”, and the jockey-boy Ned,   “Dog-bite-me”--so called from the shape of his head--   And a man whom the boys, in their musical slang,   Designed as the “Gaffer of Mulligan's Gang”.    Now Mulligan's Gang had a racer to show,   A bad 'un to look at, a good 'un to go;   Whenever they backed her you safely might swear   She'd walk in a winner, would Mulligan's mare.    But Mulligan, having some radical views,   Neglected his business and got on the booze;   He took up with runners--a treacherous troop--   Who gave him away and he “fell in the soup”.    And so it turned out on a fine summer day,   A bailiff turned up with a writ of “fi. fa.”;   He walked to the bar with a manner serene,   “I levy,” said he, “in the name of the Queen.”    Then Mulligan wanted, in spite of the law,   To pay out the bailiff with “_one_ on the jaw”;   He drew out to hit him, but, ere you could wink,   He changed his intentions and stood him a drink.    A great consultation there straightway befel   'Twixt jockey-boy Neddy and Jerry the Swell,   And the man with the head, who remarked “Why, you bet!   Dog-bite-me!” said he, “but we'll diddle 'em yet.    “We'll slip out the mare from her stall in a crack,   And put in her place the old broken-down hack;   The hack is so like her, I'm ready to swear   The bailiff will think he has Mulligan's mare.    “So out with the racer and in with the screw,   We'll show him what Mulligan's talent can do;   And if he gets nasty and dares to say much,   I'll knock him as stiff as my grandmother's crutch.”    Then off to the town went the mare and the lad;   The bailiff came out, never dreamt he was “had”;   But marched to the stall with a confident air--   “I levy,” said he, “upon Mulligan's mare.”    He watched her by day and he watched her by night,   She was never an instant let out of his sight,   For races were coming away in the West   And Mulligan's mare had a chance with the best.    “Here's a chance,” thought the bailiff, “to serve my own ends,   I'll send off a wire to my bookmaking friends:   Get all you can borrow, beg, snavel or snare   And lay the whole lot against Mulligan's mare.”    The races came round, and a crowd on the course   Were laying the mare till they made themselves hoarse,   And Mulligan's party, with ardour intense,   They backed her for pounds and for shillings and pence.    And think of the grief of the bookmaking host   At the sound of the summons to go to the post--   For down to the start with her thorough-bred air   As fit as a fiddle pranced Mulligan's mare!    They started, and off went the boy to the front,   He cleared out at once, and he made it a hunt;   He steadied as rounding the corner they wheeled,   Then gave her her head and she smothered the field.    The race put her owner right clear of his debts,   He landed a fortune in stakes and in bets,   He paid the old bailiff the whole of his pelf,   And gave him a hiding to keep for himself.    So all you bold sportsmen take warning, I pray,   Keep clear of the running, you'll find it don't pay;   For the very best rule that you'll hear in a week--   Is never to bet on a thing that can speak.    And whether you're lucky or whether you lose,   Keep clear of the cards and keep clear of the booze,   And fortune in season will answer your prayer   And send you a flyer like Mulligan's mare.     The Matrimonial Stakes      I wooed her with a steeplechase, I won her with a fall,    I made her heartstrings quiver on the flat   When the pony missed his take-off, and we crashed into the wall;    Well, she simply _had_ to have me after that!    It awoke a thrill of interest when they pulled me out for dead    From beneath the shattered ruins of a horse;   And, although she _looked_ indifferent when I landed--on my head--    In the water, it appealed to her, of course!    When I won the Flappers' Flat-race it was “all Sir Garneo”,    For she praised the way I made my final run.   And she thought the riding did it--for how _could_ the poor girl know    That a monkey could have ridden it and won!    Then they “weighed me in” a winner--it's not often that occurs!    So I didn't let my golden chances slip,   For I showed her all the blood-marks where I jabbed him with the spurs,    And the whip-strokes where I hit him with the whip.    Then I asked her if she loved me, and she seemed inclined to shirk    For a moment, so I took her by the head   (So to speak) and rushed her at it; and she seemed to like the work    When she kissed me, though she blushed a rosy red.    She's a mouth as soft as velvet, and she plenty has of heart;    I could worship every little step she takes;   And the saddling-bell is ringing, so we're going to the start,    Certain winners, for the Matrimonial Stakes!     The Mountain Squatter      Here in my mountain home,    On rugged hills and steep,   I sit and watch you come,    O Riverina Sheep!    You come from fertile plains    Where saltbush (sometimes) grows,   And flats that (when it rains)    Will blossom like the rose.    But, when the summer sun    Gleams down like burnished brass,   You have to leave your run    And hustle off for grass.    'Tis then that--forced to roam--    You come to where I keep,   Here in my mountain home,    A boarding-house for sheep.    Around me where I sit    The wary wombat goes--   A beast of little wit,    But what he knows, he _knows_.    The very same remark    Applies to me also;   I don't give out a spark,    But what I know, I _know_.    My brain perhaps would show    No convolutions deep,   But anyhow I know    The way to handle sheep.    These Riverina cracks,    They do not care to ride   The half-inch hanging tracks    Along the mountain side.    Their horses shake with fear    When loosened boulders go,   With leaps, like startled deer,    Down to the gulfs below.    Their very dogs will shirk,    And drop their tails in fright   When asked to go and work    A mob that's out of sight.    My little collie pup    Works silently and wide;   You'll see her climbing up    Along the mountain side.    As silent as a fox    You'll see her come and go,   A shadow through the rocks    Where ash and messmate grow.    Then, lost to sight and sound    Behind some rugged steep,   She works her way around    And gathers up the sheep;    And, working wide and shy,    She holds them rounded up.   The cash ain't coined to buy    That little collie pup.    And so I draw a screw    For self and dog and keep   To boundary-ride for you,    O Riverina Sheep!    And when the autumn rain    Has made the herbage grow,   You travel off again,    And glad--no doubt--to go.    But some are left behind    Around the mountain's spread,   For those we cannot find    We put them down as dead.    But when we say adieu    And close the boarding job,   I always find a few    Fresh ear-marks in my mob.    So what with those I sell,    And what "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1317"],["title","Saltbush Bill, J. P.

It's up to me to shout    Before we say good-bye--   “Here's to a howlin' drought    All west of Gundagai!”     Pioneers      They came of bold and roving stock that would not fixed abide;   They were the sons of field and flock since e'er they learnt to ride,   We may not hope to see such men in these degenerate years   As those explorers of the bush--the brave old pioneers.    'Twas they who rode the trackless bush in heat and storm and drought;   'Twas they who heard the master-word that called them farther out;   'Twas they who followed up the trail the mountain cattle made,   And pressed across the mighty range where now their bones are laid.    But now the times are dull and slow, the brave old days are dead   When hardy bushmen started out, and forced their way ahead   By tangled scrub and forests grim towards the unknown west,   And spied the far-off promised land from off the range's crest.    Oh! ye that sleep in lonely graves by far-off ridge and plain,   We drink to you in silence now as Christmas comes again,   To you who fought the wilderness through rough unsettled years--   The founders of our nation's life, the brave old pioneers.     Santa Claus in the Bush      It chanced out back at the Christmas time,    When the wheat was ripe and tall,   A stranger rode to the farmer's gate--    A sturdy man and a small.    “Rin doon, rin doon, my little son Jack,    And bid the stranger stay;   And we'll hae a crack for Auld Lang Syne,    For the morn is Christmas Day.”    “Nay now, nay now,” said the dour good-wife,    “But ye should let him be;   He's maybe only a drover chap    Frae the land o' the Darling Pea.    “Wi' a drover's tales, and a drover's thirst    To swiggle the hail nicht through;   Or he's maybe a life assurance carle    To talk ye black and blue.”    “Guid wife, he's never a drover chap,    For their swags are neat and thin;   And he's never a life assurance carle,    Wi' the brick-dust burnt in his skin.    “Guid wife, guid wife, be nae sae dour,    For the wheat stands ripe and tall,   And we shore a seven-pound fleece this year,    Ewes and weaners and all.    “There is grass tae spare, and the stock are fat    Where they whiles are gaunt and thin,   And we owe a tithe to the travelling poor,    So we maun ask him in.    “Ye can set him a chair tae the table side,    And gi' him a bite tae eat;   An omelette made of a new-laid egg,    Or a tasty bit of meat.”    “But the native cats hae taen the fowls,    They havena left a leg;   And he'll get nae omelette here at a'    Till the emu lays an egg!”    “Rin doon, rin doon, my little son Jack,    To whaur the emus bide,   Ye shall find the auld hen on the nest,    While the auld cock sits beside.    “But speak them fair, and speak them saft,    Lest they kick ye a fearsome jolt.   Ye can gi' them a feed of thae half-inch nails    Or a rusty carriage bolt.”    So little son Jack ran blithely down,    With the rusty nails in hand,   Till he came where the emus fluffed and scratched    By their nest in the open sand.    And there he has gathered the new-laid egg,    'Twould feed three men or four,   And the emus came for the half-inch nails    Right up to the settler's door.    “A waste o' food,” said the dour good-wife,    As she took the egg, with a frown,   “But he gets nae meat, unless ye rin    A paddy-melon down.”    “Gae oot, gae oot, my little son Jack,    Wi' your twa-three doggies sma';   Gin ye come nae back wi' a paddy-melon,    Then come nae back at a'.”    So little son Jack he raced and he ran,    And he was bare o' the feet,   And soon he captured a paddy-melon,    Was gorged with the stolen wheat.    “Sit doon, sit doon, my bonny wee man,    To the best that the hoose can do--   An omelette made of the emu egg    And a paddy-melon stew.”    “'Tis well, 'tis well,” said the bonny wee man;    “I have eaten the wide world's meat,   And the food that is given with right good will    Is the sweetest food to eat.    “But the night draws on to the Christmas Day    And I must rise and go,   For I have a mighty way to ride    To the land of the Esquimaux.    “And it's there I must load my sledges up,    With reindeers four-in-hand,   That go to the North, South, East, and West,    To every Christian land.”    “Tae the Esquimaux,” said the dour good-wife,    “Ye suit my husband well!   For when he gets up on his journey horse    He's a bit of a liar himsel'.”    Then out with a laugh went the bonny wee man    To his old horse grazing nigh,   And away like a meteor flash they went    Far off to the Northern sky.         .    .    .    .    .    When the children woke on the Christmas morn    They chattered with might and main--   For a sword and gun had little son Jack,    And a braw new doll had Jane,   And a packet o' nails had the twa emus;    But the dour good-wife got nane.     “In Re a Gentleman, One”        When an attorney is called before the Full Court to answer       for any alleged misconduct it is not usual to publish his name       until he is found guilty; until then the matter appears in the papers       as “In re a Gentleman, One of the Attorneys of the Supreme Court”,       or, more shortly, “In re a Gentleman, One”.      We see it each day in the paper,    And know that there's mischief in store;   That some unprofessional caper    Has landed a shark on the shore.   We know there'll be plenty of trouble    Before they get through with the fun,   Because he's been coming the double    On clients, has “Gentleman, One”.    Alas! for the gallant attorney,    Intent upon cutting a dash,   Sets out on life's perilous journey    With rather more cunning than cash.   And fortune at first is inviting--    He struts his brief hour in the sun--   But, lo! on the wall is the writing    Of Nemesis, “Gentleman, One”.    For soon he runs short of the dollars,    He fears he must go to the wall;   So Peter's trust-money he collars    To pay off his creditor, Paul;   Then robs right and left--for he goes it    In earnest when once he's begun.   Descensus Averni--he knows it;    It's easy for “Gentleman, One”.    The crash comes as sure as the seasons;    He loses his coin in a mine,   Or booming in land, or for reasons    Connected with women and wine.   Or maybe the cards or the horses    A share of the damage have done   No matter; the end of the course is    The same:  “Re a Gentleman, One”.    He struggles awhile to keep going,    To stave off detection and shame;   But creditors, clamorous growing,    Ere long put an end to the game.   At length the poor soldier of Satan    His course to a finish has run--   And just think of Windeyer waiting    To deal with “A Gentleman, One”!    And some face it boldly, and brazen    The shame and the utter disgrace;   While others, more sensitive, hasten    Their names and their deeds to efface.   They snap the frail thread which the Furies    And Fates have so cruelly spun.   May the great Final Judge and His juries    Have mercy on “Gentleman, One”!     The Melting of the Snow      There's a sunny Southern land,    And it's there that I would be   Where the big hills stand,    In the South Countrie!   When the wattles bloom again,    Then it's time for us to go   To the old Monaro country    At the melting of the snow.    To the East or to the West,    Or wherever you may be,   You will find no place    Like the South Countrie.   For the skies are blue above,    And the grass is green below,   In the old Monaro country    At the melting of the snow.    Now the team is in the plough,    And the thrushes start to sing,   And the pigeons on the bough    Sit a-welcoming the Spring.   So come my comrades all,    Let us saddle up and go   To the old Monaro country    At the melting of the snow.     A Dream of the Melbourne Cup        (1886)      Bring me a quart of colonial beer   And some doughy damper to make good cheer,    I must make a heavy dinner;   Heavily dine and heavily sup,   Of indigestible things fill up,   Next month they run the Melbourne Cup,    And I have to dream the winner.    Stoke it in, boys! the half-cooked ham,   The rich ragout and the charming cham.,    I've got to mix my liquor;   Give me a gander's gaunt hind leg,   Hard and tough as a wooden peg,   And I'll keep it down with a hard-boiled egg,    'Twill make me dream the quicker.    Now I am full of fearful feed,   Now I may dream a race indeed,    In my restless, troubled slumber;   While the night-mares race through my heated brain   And their devil-riders spur amain,   The tip for the Cup will reward my pain,    And I'll spot the winning number.         .    .    .    .    .    Thousands and thousands and thousands more,   Like sands on the white Pacific shore,    The crowding people cluster;   For evermore it's the story old,   While races are bought and backers are sold,   Drawn by the greed of the gain of gold,    In their thousands still they muster.    And the bookies' cries grow fierce and hot,   “I'll lay the Cup!  The double, if not!”     “Five monkeys, Little John, sir!”    “Here's fives bar one, I lay, I lay!”    And so they shout through the livelong day,   And stick to the game that is sure to pay,    While fools put money on, sir!    And now in my dream I seem to go   And bet with a “book” that I seem to know--    A Hebrew money-lender;   A million to five is the price I get--   Not bad! but before I book the bet   The horse's name I clean forget,    Its number and even gender.    Now for the start, and here they come,   And the hoof-strokes roar like a mighty drum    Beat by a hand unsteady;   They come like a rushing, roaring flood,   Hurrah for the speed of the Chester blood;   For Acme is making the pace so good    There are some of 'em done already.    But round the back she begins to tire,   And a mighty shout goes up “Crossfire!”     The magpie jacket's leading;   And Crossfire challenges, fierce and bold,   And the lead "]]]
