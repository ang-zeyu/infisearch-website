They had died at their post of duty.  Two of them, a little in advance of the others, were standing with their guns in their hands, as cold and as hard frozen as a monument of marble--standing sentinel with loaded guns in their frozen hands!  The tale is told.  Were they true men?  Does He who noteth the sparrow's fall, and numbers the hairs of our heads, have any interest in one like ourselves?  Yes; He doeth all things well.  Not a sparrow falls to the ground without His consent.   VIRGINIA, FAREWELL  After having served through all the valley campaign, and marched through all the wonders of Northwest Virginia, and being associated with the army of Virginia, it was with sorrow and regret that we bade farewell to \"Old Virginia's shore,\" to go to other fields of blood and carnage and death. We had learned to love Virginia; we love her now.  The people were kind and good to us.  They divided their last crust of bread and rasher of bacon with us.  We loved Lee, we loved Jackson; we loved the name, association and people of Virginia.  Hatton, Forbes, Anderson, Gilliam, Govan, Loring, Ashby and Schumaker were names with which we had been long associated.  We hated to leave all our old comrades behind us.  We felt that we were proving recreant to the instincts of our own manhood, and that we were leaving those who had stood by us on the march and battlefield when they most needed our help.  We knew the 7th and 14th Tennessee regiments; we knew the 3rd Arkansas, the 14th Georgia, and 42nd Virginia regiments.  Their names were as familiar as household words. We were about to leave the bones of Joe Bynum and Gus Allen and Patrick Hanly.  We were about to bid farewell to every tender association that we had formed with the good people of Virginia, and to our old associates among the soldiers of the Grand Army of Virginia.  _Virginia, farewell!_ Away back yonder, in good old Tennessee, our homes and loved ones are being robbed and insulted, our fields laid waste, our cities sacked, and our people slain.  Duty as well as patriotism calls us back to our native home, to try and defend it, as best we can, against an invading army of our then enemies; and, Virginia, once more we bid you a long farewell!     CHAPTER II  SHILOH   This was the first big battle in which our regiment had ever been engaged.  I do not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself; of heroes; of blood and wounds; of shrieks and groans; of brilliant charges; of cannon captured, etc.  I was but a private soldier, and if I happened to look to see if I could find out anything, \"Eyes right, guide center,\" was the order.  \"Close up, guide right, halt, forward, right oblique, left oblique, halt, forward, guide center, eyes right, dress up promptly in the rear, steady, double quick, charge bayonets, fire at will,\" is about all that a private soldier ever knows of a battle.  He can see the smoke rise and the flash of the enemy's guns, and he can hear the whistle of the minnie and cannon balls, but he has got to load and shoot as hard as he can tear and ram cartridge, or he will soon find out, like the Irishman who had been shooting blank cartridges, when a ball happened to strike him, and he halloed out, \"Faith, Pat, and be jabbers, them fellows are shooting bullets.\"  But I nevertheless remember many things that came under my observation in this battle.  I remember a man by the name of Smith stepping deliberately out of the ranks and shooting his finger off to keep out of the fight; of another poor fellow who was accidentally shot and killed by the discharge of another person's gun, and of others suddenly taken sick with colic.  Our regiment was the advance guard on Saturday evening, and did a little skirmishing; but General Gladden's brigade passed us and assumed a position in our immediate front.  About daylight on Sunday morning, Chalmers' brigade relieved Gladden's.  As Gladden rode by us, a courier rode up and told him something.  I do not know what it was, but I heard Gladden say, \"Tell General Bragg that I have as keen a scent for Yankees as General Chalmers has.\"  On Sunday morning, a clear, beautiful, and still day, the order was given for the whole army to advance, and to attack immediately.  We were supporting an Alabama brigade.  The fire opened--bang, bang, bang, a rattle de bang, bang, bang, a boom, de bang, bang, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, whirr-siz-siz-siz--a ripping, roaring boom, bang!  The air was full of balls and deadly missiles. The litter corps was carrying off the dying and wounded.  We could hear the shout of the charge and the incessant roar of the guns, the rattle of the musketry, and knew that the contending forces were engaged in a breast to breast struggle.  But cheering news continued to come back. Every one who passed would be hailed with, \"Well, what news from the front?\"  \"Well, boys, we are driving 'em.  We have captured all their encampments, everything that they had, and all their provisions and army stores, and everything.\"  As we were advancing to the attack and to support the Alabama brigade in our front, and which had given way and were stricken with fear, some of the boys of our regiment would laugh at them, and ask what they were running for, and would commence to say \"Flicker! flicker! flicker!\" like the bird called the yellowhammer, \"Flicker! flicker! flicker!\" As we advanced, on the edge of the battlefield, we saw a big fat colonel of the 23rd Tennessee regiment badly wounded, whose name, if I remember correctly, was Matt. Martin.  He said to us, \"Give 'em goss, boys. That's right, my brave First Tennessee.  Give 'em Hail Columbia!\" We halted but a moment, and said I, \"Colonel, where are you wounded?\" He answered in a deep bass voice, \"My son, I am wounded in the arm, in the leg, in the head, in the body, and in another place which I have a delicacy in mentioning.\"  That is what the gallant old Colonel said. Advancing a little further on, we saw General Albert Sidney Johnson surrounded by his staff and Governor Harris, of Tennessee.  We saw some little commotion among those who surrounded him, but we did not know at the time that he was dead.  The fact was kept from the troops.  About noon a courier dashed up and ordered us to go forward and support General Bragg's center.  We had to pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day.  I had heard and read of battlefields, seen pictures of battlefields, of horses and men, of cannon and wagons, all jumbled together, while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded, but I must confess that I never realized the \"pomp and circumstance\" of the thing called glorious war until I saw this.  Men were lying in every conceivable position; the dead lying with their eyes wide open, the wounded begging piteously for help, and some waving their hats and shouting to us to go forward.  It all seemed to me a dream; I seemed to be in a sort of haze, when siz, siz, siz, the minnie balls from the Yankee line began to whistle around our ears, and I thought of the Irishman when he said, \"Sure enough, those fellows are shooting bullets!\"  Down would drop first one fellow and then another, either killed or wounded, when we were ordered to charge bayonets.  I had been feeling mean all the morning as if I had stolen a sheep, but when the order to charge was given, I got happy.  I felt happier than a fellow does when he professes religion at a big Methodist camp-meeting.  I shouted.  It was fun then.  Everybody looked happy.  We were crowding them.  One more charge, then their lines waver and break.  They retreat in wild confusion.  We were jubilant; we were triumphant.  Officers could not curb the men to keep in line.  Discharge after discharge was poured into the retreating line.  The Federal dead and wounded covered the ground.  When in the very midst of our victory, here comes an order to halt. What! halt after today's victory?  Sidney Johnson killed, General Gladden killed, and a host of generals and other brave men killed, and the whole Yankee army in full retreat.  These four letters, h-a-l-t, O, how harsh they did break upon our ears. The victory was complete, but the word \"halt\" turned victory into defeat.  The soldiers had passed through the Yankee camps and saw all the good things that they had to eat in their sutlers' stores and officers' marquees, and it was but a short time before every soldier was rummaging to see what he could find.  The harvest was great and the laborers were not few.  The negro boys, who were with their young masters as servants, got rich. Greenbacks were plentiful, good clothes were plentiful, rations were not in demand.  The boys were in clover.  This was Sunday.  On Monday the tide was reversed.  Now, those Yankees were whipped, fairly whipped, and according to all the rules of war they ought to have retreated.  But they didn't.  Flushed with their victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and the capture of Nashville, and the whole State of Tennessee having fallen into their hands, victory was again to perch upon their banners, for Buell's army, by forced marches, had come to Grant's assistance at the eleventh hour.  Gunboats and transports were busily crossing Buell's army all of Sunday night.  We could hear their boats ringing their bells, and hear the puff of smoke and steam from their boilers.  Our regiment was the advance outpost, and we saw the skirmish line of the Federals advancing and then their main line and then their artillery.  We made a good fight on Monday morning, and I was taken by surprise when the order came for us to retreat instead of advance.  But as I said before, reader, a private soldier is but an automaton, and knows nothing of what is going on among the generals, and I am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as I saw them then and remember them now.  Should you desire to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],["title","\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#6)"],["body","out more about the battle, I refer you to history.  One incident I recollect very well.  A Yankee colonel, riding a fine gray mare, was sitting on his horse looking at our advance as if we were on review.  W. H. rushed forward and grabbed his horse by the bridle, telling him at the same time to surrender.  The Yankee seized the reins, set himself back in the saddle, put the muzzle of his pistol in W. H.'s face and fired.  About the time he pulled trigger, a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead, and his horse becoming frightened, galloped off, dragging him through the Confederate lines.  His pistol had missed its aim.  I have heard hundreds of old soldiers tell of the amount of greenback money they saw and picked up on the battlefield of Shiloh, but they thought it valueless and did not trouble themselves with bringing it off with them.  One fellow, a courier, who had had his horse killed, got on a mule he had captured, and in the last charge, before the final and fatal halt was made, just charged right ahead by his lone self, and the soldiers said, \"Just look at that brave man, charging right in the jaws of death.\" He began to seesaw the mule and grit his teeth, and finally yelled out, \"It arn't me, boys, it's this blarsted old mule.  Whoa!  Whoa!\"  On Monday morning I too captured me a mule.  He was not a fast mule, and I soon found out that he thought he knew as much as I did.  He was wise in his own conceit.  He had a propensity to take every hog path he came to.  All the bombasting that I could give him would not make him accelerate his speed.  If blood makes speed, I do not suppose he had a drop of any kind in him.  If I wanted him to go on one side of the road he was sure to be possessed of an equal desire to go on the other side. Finally I and my mule fell out.  I got a big hickory and would frail him over the head, and he would only shake his head and flop his ears, and seem to say, \"Well, now, you think you are smart, don't you?\" He was a resolute mule, slow to anger, and would have made an excellent merchant to refuse bad pay, or I will pay your credit, for his whole composition seemed to be made up the one word--no.  I frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule, and I would gladly have done so if I could have gotten one-half of his no.  Me and mule worried along until we came to a creek.  Mule did not desire to cross, while I was trying to persuade him with a big stick, a rock in his ear, and a twister on his nose.  The caisson of a battery was about to cross.  The driver said, \"I'll take your mule over for you.\"  So he got a large two-inch rope, tied one end around the mule's neck and the other to the caisson, and ordered the driver to whip up.  The mule was loath to take to the water.  He was no Baptist, and did not believe in immersion, and had his views about crossing streams, but the rope began to tighten, the mule to squeal out his protestations against such villainous proceedings.  The rope, however, was stronger than the mule's \"no,\" and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek.  On my taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say, \"You think that you are mighty smart folks, but you are a leetle too smart.\"  I gave it up that that mule's \"no\" was a little stronger than my determination.  He seemed to be in deep meditation.  I got on him again, when all of a sudden he lifted his head, pricked up his ears, began to champ his bit, gave a little squeal, got a little faster, and finally into a gallop and then a run.  He seemed all at once to have remembered or to have forgotten something, and was now making up for lost time. With all my pulling and seesawing and strength I could not stop him until he brought up with me at Corinth, Mississippi.     CHAPTER III  CORINTH   Well, here we were, again \"reorganizing,\" and after our lax discipline on the road to and from Virginia, and after a big battle, which always disorganizes an army, what wonder is it that some men had to be shot, merely for discipline's sake?  And what wonder that General Bragg's name became a terror to deserters and evil doers?  Men were shot by scores, and no wonder the army had to be reorganized.  Soldiers had enlisted for twelve months only, and had faithfully complied with their volunteer obligations; the terms for which they had enlisted had expired, and they naturally looked upon it that they had a right to go home.  They had done their duty faithfully and well.  They wanted to see their families; in fact, wanted to go home anyhow.  War had become a reality; they were tired of it.  A law had been passed by the Confederate States Congress called the conscript act.  A soldier had no right to volunteer and to choose the branch of service he preferred.  He was conscripted.  From this time on till the end of the war, a soldier was simply a machine, a conscript.  It was mighty rough on rebels.  We cursed the war, we cursed Bragg, we cursed the Southern Confederacy.  All our pride and valor had gone, and we were sick of war and the Southern Confederacy.  A law was made by the Confederate States Congress about this time allowing every person who owned twenty negroes to go home.  It gave us the blues; we wanted twenty negroes.  Negro property suddenly became very valuable, and there was raised the howl of \"rich man's war, poor man's fight.\"  The glory of the war, the glory of the South, the glory and the pride of our volunteers had no charms for the conscript.  We were directed to re-elect our officers, and the country was surprised to see the sample of a conscript's choice.  The conscript had no choice. He was callous, and indifferent whether he had a captain or not.  Those who were at first officers had resigned and gone home, because they were officers.  The poor private, a contemptible conscript, was left to howl and gnash his teeth.  The war might as well have ended then and there. The boys were \"hacked,\" nay, whipped.  They were shorn of the locks of their glory.  They had but one ambition now, and that was to get out of the army in some way or other.  They wanted to join the cavalry or artillery or home guards or pioneer corps or to be \"yaller dogs,\" or anything.  [The average staff officer and courier were always called \"yaller dogs,\" and were regarded as non-combatants and a nuisance, and the average private never let one pass without whistling and calling dogs.  In fact, the general had to issue an army order threatening punishment for the ridicule hurled at staff officers and couriers.  They were looked upon as simply \"hangers on,\" or in other words, as yellow sheep-killing dogs, that if you would say \"booh\" at, would yelp and get under their master's heels.  Mike Snyder was General George Maney's \"yaller dog,\" and I believe here is where Joe Jefferson, in Rip Van Winkle, got the name of Rip's dog Snyder.  At all times of day or night you could hear, \"wheer, hyat, hyat, haer, haer, hugh, Snyder, whoopee, hyat, whoopee, Snyder, here, here,\" when a staff officer or courier happened to pass.  The reason of this was that the private knew and felt that there was just that much more loading, shooting and fighting for him; and there are the fewest number of instances on record where a staff officer or courier ever fired a gun in their country's cause; and even at this late day, when I hear an old soldier telling of being on some general's staff, I always think of the letter \"E.\"  In fact, later in the war I was detailed as special courier and staff officer for General Hood, which office I held three days.  But while I held the office in passing a guard I always told them I was on Hood's staff, and ever afterwards I made those three days' staff business last me the balance of the war.  I could pass any guard in the army by using the magic words, \"staff officer.\" It beat all the countersigns ever invented.  It was the \"open sesame\" of war and discipline. ]  Their last hope had set.  They hated war.  To their minds the South was a great tyrant, and the Confederacy a fraud.  They were deserting by thousands.  They had no love or respect for General Bragg.  When men were to be shot or whipped, the whole army was marched to the horrid scene to see a poor trembling wretch tied to a post and a platoon of twelve men drawn up in line to put him to death, and the hushed command of \"Ready, aim, fire!\" would make the soldier, or conscript, I should say, loathe the very name of Southern Confederacy.  And when some miserable wretch was to be whipped and branded for being absent ten days without leave, we had to see him kneel down and have his head shaved smooth and slick as a peeled onion, and then stripped to the naked skin.  Then a strapping fellow with a big rawhide would make the blood flow and spurt at every lick, the wretch begging and howling like a hound, and then he was branded with a red hot iron with the letter D on both hips, when he was marched through the army to the music of the \"Rogue's March.\"  It was enough.  None of General Bragg's soldiers ever loved him.  They had no faith in his ability as a general.  He was looked upon as a merciless tyrant.  The soldiers were very scantily fed.  Bragg never was a good feeder or commissary-general.  Rations with us were always scarce. No extra rations were ever allowed to the negroes who were with us as servants.  No coffee or whisky or tobacco were ever allowed to be issued to the troops.  If they obtained these luxuries, they were not from the government.  These luxuries were withheld in order to crush the very heart and spirit of his troops.  We were crushed.  Bragg was the great autocrat.  In the mind of the soldier, his word was law.  He loved to crush the spirit of his men.  The more of a hang-dog look they had about them the better was General Bragg pleased.  Not a single soldier in the whole army ever loved or respected him.  But he is dead now.  Peace to his"]]]
