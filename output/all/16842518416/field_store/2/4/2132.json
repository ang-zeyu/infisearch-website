Quickly he opened the blade, and made a neat incision in the canvas, finally cutting out a little square. Then he put his eye to the hole and peered out.  There was no one in sight. The guard could be heard pacing to and fro in front of the tent, but apparently there was no guard at the rear.  Chester left his peep-hole and returned to Hal's side.  \"If we can get two of these bicycles out here,\" he whispered, \"we may be able to get away by a quick dash. Are you willing to take a chance?\"  \"Sure,\" agreed Hal. \"Anything is better than sitting here and waiting for I know not what. But do you think we can make it?\"  \"Well, we can at least try. There doesn't seem to be a guard in the rear. I am going to cut a big slit in the back. Then we'll slip the bicycles through it, mount and make a dash.\"  \"Good!\" said Hal.  Quietly Chester slit the canvas in the rear of the tent, making a hole large enough for a man to step through. Quietly the boys each selected a bicycle and pushed it cautiously through the opening.  Once on the outside they drew a breath of relief.  \"We'll have to depend on our luck now,\" whispered Chester. \"Come on!\"  The lads leaped into the saddles, and a moment later were speeding through the heart of the German camp.  In the very boldness of their scheme lay a certain degree of safety, for the sentinels on guard certainly did not look for two youths of the allied armies to be riding through their midst.  They were not even challenged as they sped through the camp, turning this way and that, and they had passed beyond the last row of tents before a hubbub from the rear told them that their flight had been discovered.  \"We must be careful,\" cried Hal, as he rode his wheel close beside Chester. \"There is still the outpost to pass.\"  But they did not diminish their speed. Rather, if anything, they pedaled faster; and then the outpost came into sight--a long line of men, almost in front of them. Some were pacing to and fro, while others sat upon the ground.  The riders were upon them before they knew it, and two flying bicycles sped between the German troopers. A cry of \"halt!\" went unheeded, and the Germans, quickly bringing their rifles to their shoulders, sent a volley after the lads.  But neither was hit. In the darkness the Germans were unable to aim carefully. The boys heard the hum of bullets around them, but they did not falter. There was no second volley, for the lads had disappeared in the darkness, and the Germans were not minded to spend their ammunition foolishly.  The first streak of dawn appeared in the sky, and still the boys rode on swiftly. But at length Hal slowed down and Chester followed suit.  \"I'm tired out,\" said Hal, as he jumped from his bicycle.  \"And so am I,\" replied Chester, as he, too, jumped to the ground to stretch his legs.  Suddenly from the distance in which they had come came a faint \"chug-chug.\"  Chester pricked up his ears.  \"What's that?\" he demanded anxiously.  For a brief moment Hal paused to listen. The sound became louder. Hal sprang toward his bicycle.  \"Come on!\" he cried, and leaped into the saddle. \"Motorcycles! We are pursued!\"  Chester was hardly a second behind him, and the two lads were again riding madly along the road. Fortunately there were many curves in the highway, and this fact prevented their pursuers from sighting them from any great distance.  Hal suddenly brought his bicycle to an abrupt stop and jumped to the ground. Although not knowing what plan Hal had in his mind, Chester immediately did likewise.  The spot where they had alighted was in the midst of a clump of trees, and quickly the lads drew their bicycles in among them, hiding them from sight of the road. Then Hal turned, and, with Chester close behind him, dashed back in the direction from which they had come, taking care to keep well within the shelter of the trees.  And now Chester made out the object of his friend's wild dash. It was a farmhouse, setting well back from the road. Chester had not detected it as they sped by, but Hal's keen eyes had singled it out as a possible refuge.  \"We'll have to take a chance of the occupants being friendly,\" Hal told his friend, as they ran toward the house. \"If they will allow us to hide here until night, we may be able to get back to our lines safely.\"  The boys ran around the house, and Hal rapped sharply upon the rear door. A moment later and a kindly-faced woman appeared in the doorway. She started back at the appearance of the two lads.  \"Are the English coming?\" she demanded, after a quick glance at the lads' uniforms, and then she clasped her hands and exclaimed: \"At last! At last!\"  \"No, madam,\" Hal undeceived her, \"the English are not coming--yet. We are trying to make our way back to our lines, but a German motorcycle squad is after us. We have come here to see if you will hide us until nightfall.\"  The woman was silent for one moment. Then she stepped aside and motioned them into the house.  \"Come,\" she said quietly. \"The Germans will not learn you are here through me.\"  The lads stepped inside the door, and not a moment too soon. For at that very instant a band of a dozen Germans flashed by on the road, their motorcycles kicking up a cloud of dust.     CHAPTER XII.  A TRAITOR APPEARS.   Hal turned to Chester.  \"When they fail to find us,\" he said, \"they'll come back, inquiring all along as they return. They are sure to ask for us here.\" He turned to the woman. \"Have you a place where we can hide?\"  \"Yes,\" she replied, \"there is a secret trap-door to the attic. You may go up there and no one will be the wiser.\"  \"Then we had better get up there at once,\" said Chester, \"for there is no telling how soon they may return.\"  A few moments later and they were safe in a little room at the very top of the house. After showing them to their retreat, the good woman departed, saying that she would return in a few minutes with water and food.  \"You'll need it,\" she said, when Hal protested against putting her to so much trouble. \"And, besides, I should be a poor Frenchwoman could I not aid the friends of my own country.\"  She was back in a few moments, and the lads ate hungrily of the food she brought them, for it had been long hours since food or water had passed their lips.  After their benefactress had departed, Hal said to Chester:  \"This is bound to be a tedious day. I guess we had better try and put it in sleeping. Besides, we'll need all the rest we can get for our journey to-night.\"  \"Just what I was thinking,\" said Chester, \"and I'm ready to go to sleep right this instant.\"  He stretched himself out on the floor and in a few moments was fast asleep. A short time later and Hal also lay in the arms of Morpheus.  How long the lads had slept, they did not know, but they were awakened by the sound of voices directly below them.  \"No, I have seen nothing of them,\" came the voice of the woman who had given them refuge.  \"But we have searched every place else,\" came another voice, speaking in French, but with a heavy German accent. \"They must be here. We found the bicycles a short distance from this house, and have scoured the woods. They must be here.\"  \"I say they are not,\" came the woman's voice, raised in anger.  \"Well, I must search the house, at any rate,\" said the German, \"and, if I find that you have been aiding the enemies of Germany, it will go hard with you. Stand aside, please.\"  \"I tell you there is no one here,\" cried the woman.  \"Stand aside!\" came the German's voice again, and there was the sound of a struggle, followed by the voice of the German: \"Search the house, men.\"  Then came the sounds of heavy feet tramping through the house. Hal and Chester were both wide awake now and lay silent, listening. For an hour the heavy footsteps continued to ring through the house, and there was the sound of slamming doors and moving furniture.  And finally came the voice of the woman again: \"I told you there was no one here.\"  But apparently the German officer in command was not yet satisfied.  \"Have you searched the attic?\" he demanded of his men; \"and the cellar?\"  \"There is no one in the cellar,\" came a voice in reply, \"and there is no attic.\"  \"I'll have a look for myself,\" came the reply, and heavy footsteps ascended the stairs into the room directly beneath Hal and Chester. There came to the lads' ears the sounds of heavy blows against the floor on which they lay. Evidently the German officer was making sure that there was not an opening in the ceiling of the room below. But after a while he desisted. The boys heard him descend the stairs, and a few moments later the sound of his voice:  \"There is no one up there.\"  Both lads drew a breath of relief. A moment more and a slamming door gave evidence that the Germans had departed.  \"I was afraid he would locate the trap-door,\" said Hal to Chester, after they had gone.  \"Same here,\" replied Chester. \"But I wasn't going to let them take me without a fight. Only one man could get up here at a time, and we could certainly dispose of him.\"  \"Yes, but they could starve us out, or set fire to the house or something, which would be worse than being captured. Besides, we couldn't let the woman who has aided us come to harm.\"  \"No, that's so, too,\" agreed Chester. \"I hadn't thought of that.\"  Further conversation was interrupted by a sound of some one at the trap-door. Chester and Hal both jumped to their feet, and stood ready above the opening in the floor to seize the intruder should it prove to be an enemy.  But when the trap-door came away the head of their benefactress appeared through the opening.  \"You can come down now, if you want to,\" she said. \"The Germans have been here and gone. I am sure they will not return.\"  Chester turned to Hal.  \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"Shall we go down, or had we better stay up here?\"  Hal considered for a moment.  \"I guess we might as well go down,\" he replied at length. \"I don't believe there is any likelihood of their coming "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12877"],["title","The First Hundred Thousand: Being the Unofficial Chronicle of a Unit of \"K(1)\" (#0)"],["body","THE FIRST HUNDRED THOUSAND  Being the Unofficial Chronicle of a Unit of \"K(1)\"  BY  IAN HAY        [Illustration: CAPTAIN IAN HAY BEITH]    By Ian Hay  PIP: A ROMANCE OF YOUTH.

TO MY WIFE     PUBLISHERS' NOTE   The \"Junior Sub,\" who writes the following account of the experiences of some of the first hundred thousand of Kitchener's army, is, as the title-page of the volume now reveals, Ian Hay Beith, author of those deservedly popular novels, _The Right Stuff, A Man's Man, A Safety Match_, and _Happy-Go-Lucky_.  Captain Beith, who was born in 1876 and therefore narrowly came within the age limit for military service, enlisted at the first outbreak of hostilities in the summer of 1914, and was made a sub-lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. After training throughout the fall and winter at Aldershot, he accompanied his regiment to the front in April, and, as his narrative discloses, immediately saw some very active service and rapidly rose to the rank of captain. In the offensive of September, Captain Beith's division was badly cut up and seriously reduced in numbers. He has lately been transferred to a machine-gun division, and \"for some mysterious reason\"--as he characteristically puts it in a letter to his publishers,--has been recommended for the military cross.  The story of _The First Hundred Thousand_ was originally contributed in the form of an anonymous narrative to _Blackwood's Magazine_. Writing to his publishers, last May, Captain Beith describes the circumstances under which it was written:--  \"I write this from the stone floor of an outhouse, where the pig meal is first accumulated and then boiled up at a particularly smelly French farm, which is saying a good deal. It is a most interesting life, and if I come through the present unpleasantness I shall have enough copy to last me twenty years. Meanwhile, I am using _Blackwood's Magazine_ as a safety-valve under a pseudonym.\"  It is these \"safety-valve\" papers that are here offered to the American public in their completeness,--a picture of the great struggle uniquely rich in graphic human detail.  4 PARK STREET     CONTENTS  BOOK ONE BLANK CARTRIDGES      I.

NOTE   The reader is hereby cautioned against regarding this narrative as an official history of the Great War.  The following pages are merely a record of some of the personal adventures of a typical regiment of Kitchener's Army.  The chapters were written from day to day, and published from month to month. Consequently, prophecy is occasionally falsified, and opinions moderated, in subsequent pages.  The characters are entirely fictitious, but the incidents described all actually occurred.     BOOK ONE  BLANK CARTRIDGES     The First Hundred Thousand  I  AB OVO   \"Squoad--'_Shun!_ Move to the right in fours. Forrm--_fourrrs!_\"  The audience addressed looks up with languid curiosity, but makes no attempt to comply with the speaker's request.  \"Come away now, come away!\" urges the instructor, mopping his brow. \"Mind me: on the command 'form fours,' odd numbers will stand fast; even numbers tak' a shairp pace to the rear and anither to the right. Now--forrm _fourrs!_\"  The squad stands fast, to a man. Apparently--nay, verily--they are all odd numbers.  The instructor addresses a gentleman in a decayed Homburg hat, who is chewing tobacco in the front rank.  \"Yous, what's your number?\"  The ruminant ponders.  \"Seeven fower ought seeven seeven,\" he announces, after a prolonged mental effort.  The instructor raises clenched hands to heaven.  \"Man, I'm no askin' you your regimental number! Never heed that. It's your number in the squad I'm seeking. You numbered off frae the right five minutes syne.\"  Ultimately it transpires that the culprit's number is ten. He is pushed into his place, in company with the other even numbers, and the squad finds itself approximately in fours.  \"Forrm--two _deep!_\" barks the instructor.  The fours disentangle themselves reluctantly, Number Ten being the last to forsake his post.  \"Now we'll dae it jist yince more, and have it right,\" announces the instructor, with quite unjustifiable optimism. \"Forrm--_fourrs!_\"  This time the result is better, but there is confusion on the left flank.  \"Yon man, oot there on the left,\" shouts the instructor, \"what's your number?\"  Private Mucklewame, whose mind is slow but tenacious, answers--not without pride at knowing--  \"Nineteen!\"  (Thank goodness, he reflects, odd numbers stand fast upon all occasions.)  \"Weel, mind this,\" says the sergeant--\"Left files is always even numbers, even though they are odd numbers.\"  This revelation naturally clouds Private Mucklewame's intellect for the afternoon; and he wonders dimly, not for the first time, why he ever abandoned his well-paid and well-fed job as a butcher's assistant in distant Wishaw ten long days ago.  And so the drill goes on. All over the drab, dusty, gritty parade-ground, under the warm September sun, similar squads are being pounded into shape. They have no uniforms yet: even their instructors wear bowler hats or cloth caps. Some of the faces under the brims of these hats are not too prosperous. The junior officers are drilling squads too. They are a little shaky in what an actor would call their \"patter,\" and they are inclined to lay stress on the wrong syllables; but they move their squads about somehow. Their seniors are dotted about the square, vigilant and helpful--here prompting a rusty sergeant instructor, there unravelling a squad which, in a spirited but misguided endeavour to obey an impossible order from Second Lieutenant Bobby Little, has wound itself up into a formation closely resembling the third figure of the Lancers.  Over there, by the officers' mess, stands the Colonel. He is in uniform, with a streak of parti-coloured ribbon running across above his left-hand breast-pocket. He is pleased to call himself a \"dug-out.\" A fortnight ago he was fishing in the Garry, his fighting days avowedly behind him, and only the Special Reserve between him and _embonpoint_. Now he finds himself pitchforked back into the Active List, at the head of a battalion eleven hundred strong.  He surveys the scene. Well, his officers are all right. The Second in Command has seen almost as much service as himself. Of the four company commanders, two have been commandeered while home on leave from India, and the other two have practised the art of war in company with brother Boer. Of the rest, there are three subalterns from the Second Battalion--left behind, to their unspeakable woe--and four from the O.T.C. The juniors are very junior, but keen as mustard.  But the men! Is it possible? Can that awkward, shy, self-conscious mob, with scarcely an old soldier in their ranks, be pounded, within the space of a few months, into the Seventh (Service) Battalion of the Bruce and Wallace Highlanders--one of the most famous regiments in the British Army?  The Colonel's boyish figure stiffens.  \"They're a rough crowd,\" he murmurs, \"and a tough crowd: but they're a stout crowd. By gad! we'll make them a credit to the Old Regiment yet!\"     II  THE DAILY GRIND   We have been in existence for more than three weeks now, and occasionally we are conscious of a throb of real life. Squad drill is almost a thing of the past, and we work by platoons of over fifty men. To-day our platoon once marched, in perfect step, for seven complete and giddy paces, before disintegrating into its usual formation--namely, an advance in irregular _échelon_, by individuals.  Four platoons form a company, and each platoon is (or should be) led by a subaltern, acting under his company commander. But we are very short of subalterns at present. (We are equally short of N.C.O.'s; but then you can always take a man out of the ranks and christen him sergeant, whereas there is no available source of Second Lieutenants save capricious Whitehall.) Consequently, three platoons out of four in our company are at present commanded by N.C.O.'s, two of whom appear to have retired from active service about the time that bows and arrows began to yield place to the arquebus, while the third has been picked out of the ranks simply because he possesses a loud voice and a cake of soap. None of them has yet mastered the new drill--it was all changed at the beginning of this year--and the majority of the officers are in no position to correct their anachronisms.  Still, we are getting on. Number Three Platoon (which boasts a subaltern) has just marched right round the"]]]
