Christ's all-sufficiency.  1 How fast their guilt and sorrows rise Who haste to seek some idol god! I will not taste their sacrifice, Their offerings of forbidden blood.  2 My God provides a richer cup, And nobler food to live upon; He for my life has offer'd up Jesus, his best beloved Son.  3 His love is my perpetual feast; By day his counsels guide me right; And be his name for ever blest, Who gives me sweet advice by night.  4 I set him still before mine eyes; At my right hand he stands prepar'd To keep my soul from all surprise, And be my everlasting guard.   Psalm 16:3. Third Part. L. M. Courage in death, and hope of the resurrection.  1 When God is nigh, my faith is strong, His arm is my almighty prop: Be glad, my heart; rejoice, my tongue, My dying flesh shall rest in hope.  2 Tho' in the dust I lay my head, Yet, gracious God, thou wilt not leave My soul for ever with the dead, Nor lose thy children in the grave.  3 My flesh shall thy first call obey, Shake off the dust, and rise on high; Then shalt thou lead the wondrous way, Up to thy throne above the sky.  4 There streams of endless pleasure flow; And full discoveries of thy grace (Which we but tasted here below) Spread heavenly joys thro' all the place.   Psalm 16:4. First Part. C. M. Support and counsel from God without merit.  1 Save me, O Lord, from every foe; In thee my trust I place, Tho' all the good that I can do Can ne'er deserve thy grace.  2 Yet if my God prolong my breath The saints may profit by't; The saints, the glory of the earth, The men of my delight.  3 Let heathens to their idols haste, And worship wood or stone; But my delightful lot is cast Where the true God is known.  4 His hand provides my constant food, He fills my daily cup; Much am I pleas'd with present good, But more rejoice in hope.  5 God is my portion and my joy, His counsels are my light; He gives me sweet advice by day, And gentle hints by night.  6 My soul would all her thoughts approve To his all-seeing eye; Not death, nor hell my hope shall move, While such a friend is nigh.   Psalm 16:5. Second Part. C. M. The death and resurrection of Christ.  1 I Set the Lord before my face, \"He bears my courage up; \"My heart, and tongue, their joys express, \"My flesh shall rest in hope.  2 \"My spirit, Lord, thou wilt not leave \"Where souls departed are; \"Nor quit my body to the grave \"To see corruption there.  3 \"Thou wilt reveal the path of life, \"And raise me to thy throne; \"Thy courts immortal pleasure give, \"Thy presence joys unknown.\"  4 [Thus in the name of Christ, the Lord, The holy David sung, And Providence fulfils the word Of his prophetic tongue.  5 Jesus, whom every saint adores, Was crucify'd and slain; Behold the tomb its prey restores, Behold, he lives again!  6 When shall my feet arise and stand On heaven's eternal hills? There sits the Son at God's right hand, And there the Father smiles.]   Psalm 17:1. 13 &c. S. M. Portion of saints and sinners; or, Hope and despair in death.  1 Arise, my gracious God, And make the wicked flee; They are but thy chastising rod To drive thy saints to thee.  2 Behold the sinner dies, His haughty words are vain; Here in this life his pleasure lies, And all beyond is pain.  3 Then let his pride advance, And boast of all his store: The Lord is my inheritance, My soul can wish no more.  4 I shall behold the face Of my forgiving God, And stand complete in righteousness, Wash'd in my Saviour's blood.  5 There's a new heaven begun, When I awake from death, Drest in the likeness of thy Son, And draw immortal breath.   Psalm 17:2. L. M. The sinner's portion, and saint's hope; or, The heaven of separate souls, and the resurrection.  1 Lord, I am thine; but thou wilt prove My faith, my patience, and my love; When men of spite against me join, They are the sword, the hand is thine.  2 Their hope and portion lies below; 'Tis all the happiness they know, 'Tis all they seek; they take their shares, And leave the rest among their heirs.  3 What sinners value, I resign; Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine; I shall behold thy blissful face, And stand complete in righteousness.  4 This life's a dream, an empty show; But the bright world to which I go Hath joys substantial and sincere; When shall I wake, and find me there?  5 O glorious hour! O blest abode! I shall be near and like my God! And flesh and sin no more control The sacred pleasures of the soul.  6 My flesh shall slumber in the ground, Till the last trumpet's joyful sound; Then burst the chains with sweet surprise, And in my Saviour's image rise.   Psalm 18:1. 1-6 15-18. First Part. L. M. Deliverance from despair; or, Temptations overcome.  1 Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength, My rock, my tower, my high defence, Thy mighty arm shall be my trust, For I have found salvation thence.  2 Death, and the terrors of the grave Stood round me with their dismal shade; While floods of high temptations rose, And made my sinking soul afraid.  3 I saw the opening gates of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there, Which none but they that feel can tell, While I was hurried to despair.  4 In my distress I call'd 'my God,' When I could scarce believe him mine; He bow'd his ear to my complaint, Then did his grace appear divine.  5 [With speed he flew to my relief, As on a cherub's wing he rode; Awful and bright as lightning shone The face of my deliverer, God.  6 Temptations fled at his rebuke, The blast of his almighty breath; He sent salvation from on high, And drew me from the deeps of death.]  7 Great were my fears, my foes were great, Much was their strength, and more their rage; But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still, In all the wars that devils wage.  8 My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; And give the glory to the Lord Due to his mercy and his power.   Psalm 18:2. 20-26. Second Part. L. M. Sincerity proved and rewarded.  1 Lord, thou hast seen my soul sincere, Hast made thy truth and love appear; Before mine eyes I set thy laws, And thou hast own'd my righteous cause.  2 Since I have learnt thy holy ways, I've walk'd upright before thy face; Or if my feet did e'er depart, 'Twas never with a wicked heart.  3 What sore temptations broke my rest! What wars and strugglings in my breast! But thro' thy grace that reigns within, I guard against my darling sin:  4 That sin which close besets me still, That works and strives against my will; When shall thy Spirit's sovereign power Destroy it that it rise no more?  5 [With an impartial hand, the Lord Deals out to mortals their reward; The kind and faithful souls shall find A God as faithful, and as kind.  6 The just and pure shall ever say, Thou art more pure, more just than they; And men that love revenge shall know, God hath an arm of vengeance too.]   Psalm 18:3. 30 31 34 35 46. 3d Part. L. M. Rejoicing in God; or, Salvation and triumph.  1 Just are thy ways, and true thy word, Great rock of my secure abode; Who is a God beside the Lord? Or where's a refuge like our God?  2 'Tis he that girds me with his might, Gives me his holy sword to wield; And while with sin and hell I fight, Spreads his salvation for my shield.  3 He lives (and blessed be my rock!) The God of my salvation lives, The dark designs of hell are broke; Sweet is the peace my Father gives.  4 Before the scoffers of the age, I will exalt my Father's name, Nor tremble at their mighty rage, But meet reproach and bear the shame.  5 To David and his royal seed Thy grace for ever shall extend; Thy love to saints in Christ their head Knows not a limit, nor an end.   Psalm 18:4. First Part. C. M. Victory and triumph over temporal enemies.  1 We love thee, Lord, and we adore, Now is thine arm reveal'd; Thou art our strength, our heavenly tower, Our bulwark and our shield.  2 We fly to our eternal rock, And find a sure defence; His holy name our lips invoke, And draw salvation thence.  3 When God, our leader, shines in arms, What mortal heart can bear The thunder of his loud alarms? The lightning of his spear?  4 He rides upon the winged wind, And angels in array In millions wait to know his mind, And swift as flames obey.  5 He speaks, and at his fierce rebuke, Whole armies are dismay'd; His voice, his frown, his angry look Strikes all their courage dead.  6 He forms our generals for the field, With all their dreadful skill; Gives them his awful sword to wield, And makes their hearts of steel.  7 [He arms our captains to the fight, Tho' there his name's forgot: He girded Cyrus with his might, But Cyrus knew him not.  8 Oft has the Lord whole nations blest For his own church's sake: The powers that give his people rest, Shall of his care partake.]  Psalm 18:5. Second Part. C. M. The conqueror's song.  1 To thine almighty arm we owe The triumphs of the day Thy terrors, Lord, confound the foe, And melt their strength away.  2 'Tis by thine aid our troops prevail, And break united powers, Or burn their boasted fleets, or scale The proudest of their towers.  3 How have we chas'd them thro' the field, And trod them to the ground, While thy salvation was our shield, But they no shelter found!  4 In vain to idol-saints they cry, And perish in their blood; Where is a rock so great, so high, So powerful as our God?  5 The Rock of Israel ever lives, His name be ever blest; 'Tis his own arm the victory gives, And gives his people rest.  6 On kings that reign as David did, He pours his blessings down; Secures their honours to their seed, And well supports the crown.   Psalm 19:1. First Part. S. M. The book of nature and scripture.  For a Lord's-day morning.  1 Behold the lofty sky Declares its maker God, And all his starry works on high Proclaim his power abroad.  2 The darkness and the light Still keep their course the same; While night to day, and day to night Divinely teach his name.  3 In every different land Their general voice is known They shew the wonders of his hand, And orders of his throne.  4 Ye British lands,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],["title","The Psalms of David (#6)"],["body"," rejoice, Here he reveals his word, We are not left to nature's voice To bid us know the Lord.  5 His statutes and commands Are set before our eyes; He puts his gospel in our hands, Where our salvation lies.  6 His laws are just and pure, His truth without deceit, His promises for ever sure, And his rewards are great.  7 [Not honey to the taste Affords so much delight, Nor gold that has the furnace past So much allures the sight.  8 While of thy works I sing, Thy glory to proclaim, Accept the praise, my God, my King, In my Redeemer's name.]   Psalm 19:2. Second Part. S. M. God's word most excellent; or, Sincerity and watchfulness.  For a Lord's-day morning.  1 Behold the morning sun Begins his glorious way; His beams thro' all the nations run, And life and light convey.  2 But where the gospel comes, It spreads diviner light, It calls dead sinners from their tombs, And gives the blind their sight.  3 How perfect is thy word! And all thy judgments just! For ever sure thy promise, Lord, And men securely trust.  4 My gracious God, how plain Are thy directions given! O! may I never read in vain, But find the path to heaven!  PAUSE.  5 I hear thy word with love, And I would fain obey; Send thy good Spirit from above To guide me, lest I stray.  6 O who can ever find The errors of his ways? Yet, with a bold presumptuous mind, I would not dare transgress.  7 Warn me of every sin, Forgive my secret faults, And cleanse this guilty soul of mine, Whose crimes exceed my thoughts.  8 While with my heart and tongue I spread thy praise abroad, Accept the worship and the song, My Saviour and my God.   Psalm 19:3. L. M. The books of nature and of scripture compared; or, The glory and success of the gospel.  1 The heavens declare thy glory, Lord, In every star thy wisdom shines; But when our eyes behold thy word We read thy name in fairer lines.  2 The rolling sun, the changing light, And nights and days thy power confess; But the blest volume thou hast writ Reveals thy justice and thy grace.  3 Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise Round the whole earth, and never stand; So when thy truth begun its race, It touch'd and glanc'd on every land.  4 Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest, Till thro' the world thy truth has run; Till Christ has all the nations blest, That see the light, or feel the sun.  5 Great Sun of Righteousness, arise, Bless the dark world with heavenly light; Thy gospel makes the simple wise, Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.  6 Thy noblest wonders here we view In souls renew'd and sins forgiven: Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew, And make thy word my guide to heaven.   Psalm 19:4. To the tune of the 113th Psalm. The book of nature and scripture.  1 Great God, the heaven's well-order'd frame Declares the glories of thy name; There thy rich works of wonder shine: A thousand starry beauties there, A thousand radiant marks appear Of boundless power and skill divine.  2 From night to day, from day to night, The dawning and the dying light Lectures of heavenly wisdom read; With silent eloquence they raise Our thoughts to our Creator's praise, And neither sound nor language need.  3 Yet their divine instructions run Far as the journies of the sun, And every nation knows their voice; The sun, like some young bridegroom drest, Breaks from the chambers of the east, Rolls round, and makes the earth rejoice.  4 Where'er he spreads his beams abroad, He smiles and speaks his maker God; All nature joins to shew thy praise: Thus God, in every creature shines; Fair is the book of nature's lines, But fairer is thy book of grace.  PAUSE.  5 I love the volumes of thy word; What light and joy those leaves afford To souls benighted and distrest! Thy precepts guide my doubtful way, Thy fear forbids my feet to stray; Thy promise leads my heart to rest.  6 From the discoveries of thy law The perfect rules of life I draw, These are my study and delight: Not honey so invites the taste, Nor gold, that hath the furnace past, Appears so pleasing to the sight.  7 Thy threatenings wake my slumbering eyes, And warn me where my danger lies; But 'tis thy blessed gospel, Lord, That makes my guilty conscience clean, Converts my soul, subdues my sin, And gives a free but large reward.  8 Who knows the errors of his thoughts? My God, forgive my secret faults, And from presumptuous sins restrain; Accept my poor attempts of praise That I have read thy book of grace, And book of nature, not in vain.   Psalm 20. Prayer and hope of victory. For a day of prayer in time of war.  1 Now may the God of power and grace Attend his people's humble cry! Jehovah hears when Israel prays, And brings deliverance from on high.  2 The name of Jacob's God defends Better than shields or brazen walls; He from his sanctuary sends Succour and strength, when Zion calls.  3 Well he remembers all our sighs, His love exceeds our best deserts, His love accepts the sacrifice Of humble groans and broken hearts.  4 In his salvation is our hope, And, in the name of Israel's God, Our troops shall lift their banners up, Our navies spread their flags abroad.  5 Some trust in horses train'd for war, And some of chariots make their boast; Our surest expectations are From thee, the Lord of heavenly hosts.  6 [O! may the memory of thy name Inspire our armies for the fight! Our foes shall fall and die with shame, Or quit the field with shameful flight.]  7 Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear; Now let our hopes be firm and strong, Till the salvation shall appear, And joy and triumph raise the song.   Psalm 21:1. C. M. Our king is the care of heaven.  1 The king, O Lord, with songs of praise, Shall in thy strength rejoice; And, blest with thy salvation, raise To heaven his cheerful voice.  2 Thy sure defence, thro' nations round, Has spread his glorious name; And his successful actions crown'd With majesty and fame.  3 Then let the king on God alone For timely aid rely; His mercy shall support the throne, And all our wants supply.  4 But, righteous Lord, his stubborn foes Shall feel thy dreadful hand Thy vengeful arm shall find out those That hate his mild command.  5 When thou against them dost engage, Thy just but dreadful doom Shall, like a fiery oven's rage, Their hopes and them consume.  6 Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare, And thus exalt thy fame; Whilst we glad songs of praise prepare For thine almighty name.   Psalm 21:2. 1-9. L. M. Christ exalted to the kingdom.  1 David rejoic'd in God his strength, Rais'd to the throne by special grace; But Christ, the Son, appears at length, Fulfils the triumph and the praise.  2 How great is the Messiah's joy In the salvation of thy hand! Lord, thou hast rais'd his kingdom high, And given the world to his command.  3 Thy goodness grants whate'er he will, Nor doth the least request withhold; Blessings of love prevent him still, And crowns of glory, not of gold.  4 Honour and majesty divine Around his sacred temples shine; Blest with the favour of thy face, And length of everlasting days.  5 Thy hand shall find out all his foes; And as a fiery oven glows With raging heat and living coals, So shall thy wrath devour their souls.   Psalm 22:1. 1-16. First Part. C. M, The sufferings and death of Christ.  1 \"Why has my God my soul forsook, \"Nor will a smile afford?\" (Thus David once in anguish spoke, And thus our dying Lord.)  2 Tho' 'tis thy chief delight to dwell Among thy praising saints, Yet thou canst hear a groan as well, And pity our complaints.  3 Our fathers trusted in thy name, And great deliverance found; But I'm a worm, despis'd of men, And trodden to the ground.  4 Shaking the head they pass me by, And laugh my soul to scorn; \"In vain he trusts in God\" they cry, \"Neglected and forlorn.\"  5 But thou art he who form'd my flesh By thine almighty word, And since I hung upon the breast, My hope is in the Lord.  6 Why will my Father hide his face, When foes stand threatening round, In the dark hour of deep distress, And not an helper found?  PAUSE.  7 Behold thy darling left among The cruel and the proud, As bulls of Bashan fierce and strong, As lions roaring loud.  8 From earth and hell my sorrows meet To multiply the smart; They nail my hands, they pierce my feet And try to vex my heart.  9 Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose The rage of earth and hell, Why will my heavenly Father bruise The Son he loves so well?  10 My God, if possible it be, Withhold this bitter cup; But I resign my will to thee, And drink the sorrows up.  11 My heart dissolves with pangs unknown In groans I waste my breath; Thy heavy hand has brought me down Low as the dust of death.  12 Father, I give my spirit up; And trust it in thy hand; My dying flesh shall rest in hope, And rise at thy command.   Psalm 22:2. 20 21 27-31. 2d Part. C. M. Christ's sufferings and kingdom.  1 \"Now from the roaring lion's rage, \"O Lord, protect thy Son; \"Nor leave thy darling to engage, \"The powers of hell alone.\"  2 Thus did our suffering Saviour pray, With mighty cries and tears; God heard him in that dreadful day, And chas'd away his fears.  3 Great was the victory of his death, His throne exalted high; And all the kindreds of the earth Shall worship or shall die.  4 A numerous offspring must arise From his expiring groans; They shall be reckon'd in his eyes For daughters and for sons.  5 The meek and humble soul shall see His table richly spread; And all that seek the Lord shall be With joys immortal fed.  6 The isles shall know the righteousness Of our incarnate God; And nations yet unborn profess Salvation in his blood.   Psalm 22:3. L. M. Christ's sufferings and exaltation.  1 Now let our mournful songs record The dying sorrows of our Lord; When he complain'd in tears and blood As one forsaken of his God.  2 The Jews beheld him thus forlorn, And shake their heads, and laugh in scorn; \"He rescu'd others from the grave, \"Now let him try himself to save.  3 \"This is the man did once pretend \"God was his father and his friend; \"If God the blessed lov'd him so, \"Why doth he "]]]
