They would rest for two or three hours and then try to go back home to their former range.\" The party won through, however, and descended into the smiling valleys of California, ninety-year-old lady and all.  These parties which were hastily got together for the mere purpose of progress soon found that they must have some sort of government to make the trip successful. A leader was generally elected to whom implicit obedience was supposed to be accorded. Among independent and hot-headed men quarrels were not infrequent. A rough sort of justice was, however, invoked by vote of the majority. Though a \"split of blankets\" was not unknown, usually the party went through under one leadership. Fortunate were those who possessed experienced men as leaders, or who in hiring the services of one of the numerous plains guides obtained one of genuine experience. Inexperience and graft were as fatal then as now. It can well be imagined what disaster could descend upon a camping party in a wilderness such as the Old West, amidst the enemies which that wilderness supported. It is bad enough today when inexperienced people go to camp by a lake near a farm-house. Moreover, at that time everybody was in a hurry, and many suspected that the other man was trying to obtain an advantage.  Hittell tells of one ingenious citizen who, in trying to keep ahead of his fellow immigrants as he hurried along, had the bright idea of setting on fire and destroying the dry grass in order to retard the progress of the parties behind. Grass was scarce enough in the best circumstances, and the burning struck those following with starvation. He did not get very far, however, before he was caught by a posse who mounted their best horses for pursuit. They shot him from his saddle and turned back. This attempt at monopoly was thus nipped in the bud.  Probably there would have been more of this sort of thing had it not been for the constant menace of the Indians. The Indian attack on the immigrant train has become so familiar through Wild West shows and so-called literature that it is useless to redescribe it here. Generally the object was merely the theft of horses, but occasionally a genuine attack, followed in case of success by massacre, took place. An experience of this sort did a great deal of good in holding together not only the parties attacked, but also those who afterwards heard of the attempt.  There was, however, another side to the shield, a very encouraging and cheerful side. For example, some good-hearted philanthropist established a kind of reading-room and post-office in the desert near the headwaters of the Humboldt River. He placed it in a natural circular wall of rock by the road, shaded by a lone tree. The original founder left a lot of newspapers on a stone seat inside the wall with a written notice to \"Read and leave them for others.\"  Many trains, well equipped, well formed, well led, went through without trouble--indeed, with real pleasure. Nevertheless the overwhelming testimony is on the other side. Probably this was due in large part to the irritability that always seizes the mind of the tenderfoot when he is confronted by wilderness conditions. A man who is a perfectly normal and agreeable citizen in his own environment becomes a suspicious half-lunatic when placed in circumstances uncomfortable and unaccustomed. It often happened that people were obliged to throw things away in order to lighten their loads. When this necessity occurred, they generally seemed to take an extraordinary delight in destroying their property rather than in leaving it for anybody else who might come along. Hittell tells us that sugar was often ruined by having turpentine poured over it, and flour was mixed with salt and dirt; wagons were burned; clothes were torn into shreds and tatters. All of this destruction was senseless and useless, and was probably only a blind and instinctive reaction against hardships.  Those hardships were considerable. It is estimated that during the height of the overland migration in the spring of 1849 no less than fifty thousand people started out. The wagon trains followed almost on one another's heels, so hot was the pace. Not only did the travelers wish to get to the Sierras before the snows blocked the passes, not only were they eager to enter the gold mines, but they were pursued by the specter of cholera in the concentration camps along the Mississippi Valley. This scourge devastated these gatherings. It followed the men across the plains like some deadly wild beast, and was shaken off only when the high clear climate of desert altitude was eventually reached.  But the terrible part of the journey began with the entrance into the great deserts, like that of the Humboldt Sink. There the conditions were almost beyond belief. Thousands were left behind, fighting starvation, disease, and the loss of cattle. Women who had lost their husbands from the deadly cholera went staggering on without food or water, leading their children. The trail was literally lined with dead animals. Often in the middle of the desert could be seen the camps of death, the wagons drawn in a circle, the dead animals tainting the air, every living human being crippled from scurvy and other diseases. There was no fodder for the cattle, and very little water. The loads had to be lightened almost every mile by the discarding of valuable goods. Many of the immigrants who survived the struggle reached the goal in an impoverished condition. The road was bordered with an almost unbroken barrier of abandoned wagons, old mining implements, clothes, provisions, and the like. As the cattle died, the problem of merely continuing the march became worse. Often the rate of progress was not more than a mile every two or three hours. Each mile had to be relayed back and forth several times. And when this desert had sapped their strength, they came at last to the Sink itself, with its long white fields of alkali with drifts of ashes across them, so soft that the cattle sank half-way to their bellies. The dust was fine and light and rose chokingly; the sun was strong and fierce. All but the strongest groups of pioneers seemed to break here. The retreats became routs. Each one put out for himself with what strength he had left. The wagons were emptied of everything but the barest necessities. At every stop some animal fell in the traces and had to be cut out of the yoke. If a wagon came to a full stop, it was abandoned. The animals were detached and driven forward. And when at last they reached the Humboldt River itself, they found it almost impossible to ford. The best feed lay on the other side. In the distance the high and forbidding ramparts of the Sierra Nevadas reared themselves.  One of these Forty-niners, Delano, a man of some distinction in the later history of the mining communities, says that five men drowned themselves in the Humboldt River in one day out of sheer discouragement. He says that he had to save the lives of his oxen by giving Indians fifteen dollars to swim the river and float some grass across to him. And with weakened cattle, discouraged hearts, no provisions, the travelers had to tackle the high rough road that led across the mountains.  Of course, the picture just drawn is of the darkest aspect. Some trains there were under competent pioneers who knew their job; who were experienced in wilderness travel; who understood better than to chase madly away after every cut-off reported by irresponsible trappers; who comprehended the handling and management of cattle; who, in short, knew wilderness travel. These came through with only the ordinary hardships. But take it all in all, the overland trail was a trial by fire. One gets a notion of its deadliness from the fact that over five thousand people died of cholera alone. The trail was marked throughout its length by the shallow graves of those who had succumbed. He who arrived in California was a different person from the one who had started from the East. Experience had even in so short a time fused his elements into something new. This alteration must not be forgotten when we turn once more to the internal affairs of the new commonwealth.      CHAPTER VI  THE MORMONS   In the westward overland migration the Salt Lake Valley Mormons played an important part. These strange people had but recently taken up their abode in the desert. That was a fortunate circumstance, as their necessities forced them to render an aid to the migration that in better days would probably have been refused.  The founder of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith, Jr., came from a commonplace family.  Apparently its members were ignorant and superstitious. They talked much of hidden treasure and of supernatural means for its discovery. They believed in omens, signs, and other superstitions. As a boy Joseph had been shrewd enough and superstitious enough to play this trait up for all it was worth. He had a magic peep-stone and a witch-hazel divining-rod that he manipulated so skillfully as to cause other boys and even older men to dig for him as he wished. He seemed to delight in tricking his companions in various ways, by telling fortunes, reeling off tall yarns, and posing as one possessed of occult knowledge.  According to Joseph's autobiography, the discovery of the Mormon Bible happened in this wise: on the night of September 21, 1823, a vision fell upon him; the angel Moroni appeared and directed him to a cave on the hillside; in this cave he found some gold plates, on which were inscribed strange characters, written in what Smith described as \"reformed Egyptian\"; they were undecipherable except by the aid of a pair of magic peep-stones named Urim and Thummim, delivered him for the purpose by the angel at Palmyra; looking through the hole in these peep-stones, he was able to interpret the gold plates.

The doctors at the United States Naval Academy won't pass any nervous wrecks,\" laughed Dave Darrin.  \"Don't you understand?\" demanded Dan, in a hurt voice.  \"The nearer we get to Annapolis the more nervous I'm getting.\"  \"You'd better drop off, then,\" hinted Dave ironically, \"and take the next car back to Odenton and Baltimore.  What earthly good would a Naval officer be who was going to get nervous as soon as he came in sight of an enemy?\"  \"But I wouldn't get nervous in the sight the enemy,\" flared up Dan Dalzell.  \"Then why get nervous about the folks down at the Naval Academy? They all intend to be your friends!\"  \"I guess that is true,\" Dan went on.  \"Of course, back in April, we went before the Civil Service Commission and took our academic examinations.  We passed, and haven't got that to go up against again.\"  \"We passed the home medical examiner, too,\" retorted Dave.  \"In fact, you might say that we passed the sawbones with honors.  \"But that medical chap put in a long time listening at my chest,\" complained Dan Dalzell, who was undeniably fidgeting in his seat. \"Then, too, the civil service sawbones told me that, while he passed me, as far as he was concerned, I'd have to stand the ordeal again before the Naval surgeons at Annapolis.\"  \"Well, he did just the same thing with me,\" rejoined Darrin. \"You just keep your eye on me, Dan!  Do you see me shaking?  Do you hear my voice falter?  See me burning any blue lights?  \"Perhaps, Dave, you don't take the whole business as much to heart as I do,\" continued Dan Dalzell almost tremulously.  \"Why, Great Scott, if they drop me at the Naval Academy, I'll be the bluest fellow you ever saw!  But maybe you won't care, Dave, whether you are dropped or not.\"  \"Won't I?\" grumbled Darrin.  \"The Navy is the only thing in life that I care about!\"  \"Then aren't you nervous, just now?\" demanded Dan.  \"If I am, I'm not making a show of myself,\" retorted Darrin.  \"But are you nervous?\" begged Dan.  \"No!\" roared Dave, and then he allowed a grin to creep over his face.  \"Oh, go ahead and say so tonight,\" jeered Dan.  \"Tomorrow, if you have the good luck to get sworn in, you'll have to quit fibbing and begin practicing at telling the truth.  A midshipman at the Naval Academy, I understand, is kicked out of the service if he tells lies.\"  \"Not quite--only in case he gets caught,\" laughed Dave Darrin.  \"But really, about being nervous--\"  \"Oh, forget that sort of nonsense, won't you, Dan, old fellow?\" begged his chum.  \"Just get your eye on the lovely country we're going through.\"  It was just about the first of June.  Our two young travelers had come by train, from Baltimore to a little country junction. Thence they had traveled, briefly, by trolley, to Odenton. There, after a wait of some minutes, they had boarded another trolley car, and were now bowling along through the open country of that part of Maryland.  At the end of their journey lay the historic little town of Annapolis.  It was now after seven o'clock; still daylight, the fag end of a beautiful June day in Maryland.  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell had been appointed as midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy.  If they should succeed in passing the four years' course in the big government school at Annapolis, they would then be sent to sea for two years, as midshipmen, after which they would return to Annapolis for their final examinations. Passing these last examinations, they would then be commissioned as ensigns in the United States Navy, with the possibility of some day becoming full-fledged admirals.  Readers of our High School Boys Series have no need of further introduction to Dave and Dan.  These two young men will be remembered as former members of Dick & Co., six famous chums back in the lively little city of Gridley.  Dick Prescott, Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazleton had composed the famous sextette who, in their day at Gridley High School, had been fast chums and leaders in all pertaining to High School athletics in their part of the state.  Following their High School days, however, the six chums had become somewhat widely scattered.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes secured appointments to the United States Military Academy.  Readers of our West Point Series are already familiar with the stirring doings and life of Dick and Greg at the fine old Army Academy on the Hudson.  At the time this present narrative opens Dick and Greg had been nearly three months as plebe cadets, as told in the first volume of the West Point Series, under the title, \"DICK PRESCOTT'S FIRST YEAR AT WEST POINT.\"  Tom Reade and Harry Hazleton had gone from Gridley High School to the far West, where they had connected themselves with a firm of civil engineers engaged in railway construction.  What befell Tom and Harry is told in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS IN COLORADO,\" the first and very entertaining volume in the Young Engineers Series.  Readers of \"THE HIGH SCHOOL CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM\" recall how Dave Darrin won his appointment to the Naval Academy, as did Dick Prescott his chance for West Point, from the Congressman of the home district. Dalzell's appointment, on the other hand, came from one of the two United States Senators from that state.  And here Dave and Dan were, on a trolley car from Odenton, rapidly nearing Annapolis.  At the forward end of the car was a small compartment set apart for the use of smokers Dave and Dan did not smoke; they had take seats in this compartment because they wished to be alone.  \"You asked me to let you know when we got near Annapolis, gentlemen,\" announced the conductor, a cheery-faced young man, thrusting his head in.  \"There is the town right ahead of you.\"  \"You said that you go by the hotel, I think?\" Dave asked.  \"I'll stop and call the hotel,\" replied the conductor.  \"We'll be there in less than two minutes.\"  It was a quaint, old-fashioned, very pretty southern town that the car now entered.  \"I'll bet they're a thousand years behind the times here,\" sighed Dalzell, as they gazed about them.  \"Not at the Naval Academy, anyway,\" retorted Dave Darrin.  \"Oh, of course not,\" Dan made haste to agree.  The car passed an imposing-looking brick building that housed the post-office, then sped along past the handsome, dignified old residence of the Governor of Maryland.  Up on a hill at their left the State Capitol stood out.  Then the car bell clanged, and the car stopped.  \"Maryland Hotel!\" called the conductor.  Dave and Dan caught up their suit cases and descended from the car.  At their right, the found the steps leading to the porch of the roomy old hotel.  In another moment they were in the office, registering.  \"You want a room together, gentlemen?\" asked the clerk.  \"Surely,\" retorted Dan.  \"My friend is always afraid when the gas is turned off.  My presence quiets him.\"  \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but are you on your way to the Naval Academy?\" queried the clerk.  \"Yes,\" nodded Dave quietly.  \"Then you will want a room with bath, of course.  You'll have to strip before the medical examiners tomorrow.  \"A room with bath, of course,\" assented Dan.  \"I never have stopped at a hotel without a bathroom.\"  Dan didn't mention that this was the first time he had ever stopped at a hotel in his short life.  \"Front!\" called the clerk.  A small black boy in knee trousers came forward, picked up their suit cases and led the way to the next floor.  \"My!  I wonder who else is expected,\" muttered Dalzell, as the two young travelers found themselves in their room after the boy had left them.  It was an enormous room, and the three beds in it did not crowd the apartment in the least.  All the furniture was of a massive and old-fashioned pattern.  A few minutes later, with face and hands washed--clean collars, clothes neatly brushed, the two clear-eyed, manly-looking young fellows returned to the first floor.  \"I suppose this hotel is full of young men like ourselves, wondering what tomorrow will bring them, when they get before the sawbones,\" muttered Dan.  \"Candidates, like ourselves, you mean?\" suggested Darrin.  \"We'll inquire.\"  With that, he approached the clerk and made the inquiry.  \"Oh, no,\" replied the clerk, in answer to Dave's question.  \"There are only two other candidates besides yourselves stopping here. There are a good many young men in town, of course, but most of them have been here for some weeks, and are in lodging houses. A good many young men come here, you know, to attend the Naval preparatory schools before they go up for their examinations.\"  \"We've had our academic examinations, and have passed,\" announced Dan.  \"What about supper, sir?\" asked Dave, who, in his short trip through the South, had noticed that in this part of the country the \"sir\" is generally"]]]
