It was the idea of the author that it should appear in one of the leading newspapers or magazines before the election, but maturer reflection brought about a change of purpose. He realized that its publication at that time, might, not altogether unreasonably, be looked upon as a political move having as its object the election or defeat of a particular candidate for office, whereas he had no desire to play the partisan. His sole aim was to vindicate the character of a portion of the citizens of this country--some living, some dead--whom he had always believed to be most deserving of popular esteem, from what he considered the unmerited aspersions of a man who has since come into a position so conspicuous and so influential that his condemnation necessarily carries with it a damaging effect.  Having gone so far as the preparation of the initial chapter, he concluded that proofs of his assumptions and assertions might at certain points be thought desirable, if not necessary, and that he should so prolong his work as to provide them. His first idea at this point, as his years went back beyond the beginning of the Abolitionist movement in this country, and as he had been from early boyhood identified with this movement, was to contribute such information as his recollection of events would supply. In other words, he decided to write a narrative, the matter of which would be reminiscent, with here and there a little history woven in among the strands of memory like a woof in the warp. It has ended in history supplying the warp, and the reminiscence indifferently supplying the woof.  However, the value of the production is, doubtless, greatly enhanced by the change. A string of pearls--dropping the former simile and adopting another--is estimated according to the gems it contains, and not because of the cord that holds it together. The personal experiences and recollections that are here and there interwoven, by themselves would be of little consequence; but they will be found to carry upon them certain historical facts and inferences--some new in themselves and in their connections--which, as the author hopes and believes, are of profitable quality and abounding interest.  In consequence of the change of plan just explained, the scope of the work is materially affected. What was begun as a magazine article, and continued as a brochure, ends in a volume.  J.F.H.

Benton in Houghton, Mifflin, & Co.'s American Statesmen Series, published in 1887:    \"Owing to a variety of causes, the Abolitionists have received an   immense amount of hysterical praise which they do not deserve, and   have been credited with deeds done by other men whom, in reality,   they hampered and opposed rather than aided. After 1840, the   professed Abolitionists formed a small and comparatively   unimportant portion of the forces that were working towards the   restriction and ultimate destruction of slavery; and much of what   they did was positively harmful to the cause for which they were   fighting. Those of their number who considered the Constitution as   a league with death and hell, and who, therefore, advocated a   dissolution of the Union, acted as rationally as would   anti-polygamists nowadays if, to show their disapproval of   Mormonism, they should advocate that Utah should be allowed to   form a separate nation. The only hope of ultimately suppressing   slavery lay in the preservation of the Union, and every   Abolitionist who argued or signed a petition for the dissolution   was doing as much to perpetuate the evil he complained of, as if   he had been a slaveholder. The Liberty party, in running Birney,   simply committed a political crime, evil in almost all its   consequences. They in no sense paved the way for the Republican   party, or helped forward the Anti-Slavery cause, or hurt the   existing organizations. Their effect on the Democracy was _nil_;   and all they were able to accomplish with the Whigs was to make   them put forward for the ensuing election a slaveholder from   Louisiana, with whom they were successful. Such were the remote   results of their conduct; the immediate evils they produced have   already been alluded to. They bore considerable   resemblance--except that after all they really did have a   principle to contend for--to the political Prohibitionists of the   present day, who go into the third party organization, and are,   not even excepting the saloon-keepers themselves, the most   efficient allies on whom intemperance and the liquor traffic can   count.    \"Anti-Slavery men like Giddings, who supported Clay, were doing a   thousandfold more effective work for the cause they had at heart   than all the voters who supported Birney; or, to speak more   accurately, they were doing all they could to advance the cause,   while the others were doing all they could to hold it back.   Lincoln in 1860 occupied more nearly the ground held by Clay than   that held by Birney; and the men who supported the latter in 1844   were the prototypes of those who worked to oppose Lincoln in 1860,   and only worked less hard because they had less chance. The ultra   Abolitionists discarded expediency, and claimed to act for   abstract right on principle, no matter what the results might be;   in consequence they accomplished very little, and that as much   for harm as for good, until they ate their words, and went   counter to their previous course, thereby acknowledging it to be   bad, and supported in the Republican party the men and principles   they had so fiercely condemned. The Liberty party was not in any   sense the precursor of the Republican party, which was based as   much on expediency as on abstract right, and was, therefore, able   to accomplish good instead of harm. To say that extreme   Abolitionists triumphed in Republican success and were causes of   it, is as absurd as to call Prohibitionists successful if, after   countless efforts totally to prohibit the liquor traffic, and   after savage denunciations of those who try to regulate it, they   should then turn round and form a comparatively insignificant   portion of a victorious high-license party. The men who took a   great and effective part in the fight against slavery were the men   who remained with their respective parties.\"  No word of praise or approval has Mr. Roosevelt for the men and women--for representatives of both sexes were active sharers in the work performed--who inaugurated, and for a long period carried forward, the movement that led up to the overthrow of African slavery in this country. He has no encomiums to bestow on those same men and women for the protracted and exhausting labors they performed, the dangers they encountered, the insults they endured, the sacrifices they submitted to, the discouragements they confronted in many ways and forms in prosecuting their arduous undertaking. On the contrary, he has only bitter words of condemnation. In his estimation, and according to his dogmatic utterance, they were criminals--political criminals. His words make it very manifest that, if Mr. Roosevelt had been a voter in 1840, he would not have been an Abolitionist. He would not have been one of that devoted little band of political philanthropists who went out, like David of old, to do battle with one of the giant abuses of the time, and who found in the voter's ballot a missile that they used with deadly effect. On the contrary, he would have enrolled himself "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13176"],["title","The Abolitionists (#1)"],["body","their adversaries and assailants, becoming a member--because it is impossible to think of Theodore Roosevelt as a non-partisan--of one of the leading political parties of the day. There were but two of them--the Whigs and the Democrats. In failing to support one or the other of these parties, and giving their votes and influence to a new one that was founded and constructed on Anti-Slavery lines, the Abolitionists, in Mr. Roosevelt's opinion, \"committed a political crime.\"  Now, for what did those parties stand in 1840? Who were their presidential candidates in that year? Martin Van Buren was the candidate of the Democrats. He had been for eight years in the offices of Vice-President and President, and in that time, in the opinion of the Anti-Slavery people of the country, had shown himself to be a facile instrument in the hands of the slaveholders. He was what the Abolitionists described as a \"doughface\"--a Northern man with Southern principles. As presiding officer he gave the casting vote in the Senate for the bill that excluded Anti-Slavery matter from the United States mails, a bill justly regarded as one of the greatest outrages ever perpetrated in a free country, and as holding a place by the side of the Fugitive Slave Law. True, he afterwards--this was in 1848,--like Saul of Tarsus, saw a new light and announced himself as a Free Soiler. Then the Abolitionists, with what must always be regarded as an extraordinary concession to partisan policy, cast aside their prejudices and gave him their support. Yet Mr. Roosevelt charges them with being indifferent to the demands of political expediency.  General William Henry Harrison, candidate of the Whigs, was a Virginian by birth and training, and an inveterate pro-slavery man. When Governor of the Territory of Indiana, he presided over a convention that met for the purpose of favoring, notwithstanding the prohibition in the Ordinance of '87, the introduction of slavery in that Territory.  These were the men between whom the old parties gave the Abolitionists the privilege of pick and choice. Declining to support either of them, they gave their votes to James G. Birney, candidate of the newly formed Liberty party. He was a Southern man by birth and a slave-owner by inheritance, but, becoming convinced that slavery was wrong, he freed his negroes, giving them homes of their own, and so frankly avowed his Anti-Slavery convictions that he was driven from his native State. His supporters did not expect to elect him, but they hoped to begin a movement that would lead up to victory. They were planting seed in what they believed to be receptive soil.  After 1840, the old parties became more and more submissive to the Slave Power. Conjointly, they enacted those measures that became known as the compromises of 1850, the principal ones being the Fugitive Slave Law and the act repealing the Missouri Compromise. Both of them pronounced these acts to be \"a finality,\" and both of them in national convention declared there should be no further agitation of the subject. They set out to muzzle all the Anti-Slavery voices of the country.  By this time it was perfectly manifest that there was not only nothing the slaveholders might demand which the old parties would not concede, but that there was, so far as the slavery issue was involved, absolutely no difference between them. It is a notable fact that in the eight years following 1840, of the four presidential candidates put in nomination by the two parties, three were slaveholders, the fourth being a Northern \"doughface,\" and both of the two who were elected held slaves.  For the nomination and election of one of these men, whom he describes as \"a slaveholder from Louisiana\" (General Taylor), Mr. Roosevelt is disposed to hold the Abolitionists accountable. They forced the poor Whigs into those proceedings, he intimates, probably by telling them they ought to do nothing of the kind, that being what they actually did tell them. But as the Abolitionists, four years earlier, in the same way defeated the Whigs when they were supporting a slaveholder from Kentucky (Clay), and a man who, in his time, did more for the upbuilding of slavery than any other person in America, it would appear that the score of responsibility on their part was fairly evened up.  In citing the action of Joshua R. Giddings as an anti-third-party man, Mr. Roosevelt is not altogether fortunate. Subsequent to the presidential campaign of 1844, the third-party Abolitionists held a convention in Pittsburg, in which Giddings was a leading actor. As chairman of the committee on platform, he submitted a resolution declaring that both of the old parties were \"hopelessly corrupt and unworthy of confidence.\"  The Abolitionists could not see that they were under obligation to either of the old parties, believing they could do far better service for the cause they championed by standing up and being counted as candidates honestly representing their principles. They fought both of the old parties, and finally beat them. They killed the Whig party out and out, and so far crippled the Democrats that they have been limping ever since. Their action, in the long run, as attested by the verdict of results, proved itself to be not only the course of abstract right, but of political expediency.  In 1840, the vote of the third-party Abolitionists, then for the first time in the political field, was 7000; in 1844 it was 60,000, and in 1848 it was nearly 300,000. From that time, with occasional backsets, Mr. Roosevelt's \"political criminals\" went steadily forward until they mastered the situation. From the first, they were a power in the land, causing the older parties to quake, Belshazzar-like, at sight of their writing on the wall.  But according to Mr. Roosevelt, the men of the Liberty-Free-Soil party had no share in fathering and nurturing the Republican party, to which he assigns all the credit for crushing slavery. Says he, \"The Liberty party was not in any sense the precursor of the Republican party, which was based as much on expediency as on abstract right.\" It is very true that many Republicans, especially in the earlier days, were neither Abolitionists nor Anti-Slavery people. A good many of them, like Abraham Lincoln, were sentimentally adverse to slavery, but under existing conditions did not want it disturbed. Many of them, having broken loose from the old parties, had no other place of shelter and cared nothing for slavery one way or the other, some being of the opinion of one of the new party leaders whom the writer hereof heard declare that \"the niggers are just where they ought to be.\" All this, however, does not prove that the third-party people were not the real forerunners and founders of the Republican party. They certainly helped to break up the old organizations, crushing them in whole or part. They supplied a contingent of trained and desperately earnest workers, their hearts being enlisted as well as their hands. And what was of still greater consequence, they furnished an issue, and one that was very much alive, around which the detached fragments of the old parties could collect and unite. Their share in the composition and development of the new party can be illustrated. Out in our great midland valley two rivers--the Missouri and the Mississippi--meet and mingle their waters. The Missouri, although the larger stream, after the junction is heard of no more; but being charged with a greater supply of sedimentary matter, gives its color to the combined flood of the assimilated waters. Abolitionism was merged in Republicanism. It was no longer spoken of as a separate element, but from the beginning it gave color and character to the combination. The whole compound was Abolitionized.  It was not, indeed, the voting strength, although this was considerable, that the Abolitionists brought to the Republican organization, that made them the real progenitors of that party. It is possible that the other constituents entering into it, which were drawn from the Anti-Slavery Whigs, the \"Anti-Nebraska\" Democrats, the \"Barnburner\" Democrats of New York, the \"Know-Nothings,\" etc., numbered more in the aggregate than the Abolitionists it included; but it was not so much the number of votes the Abolitionists contributed that made them the chief creators of the Republican party, as it was their working and fighting ability. They had undergone a thorough training. For nearly twenty years they had been in the field in active service. For the whole of that time they had been exposed to pro-slavery mobbing and almost every kind of persecution. They had to conquer every foot of ground they occupied. They had done an immense amount of invaluable preparatory work. To deny to such people a liberal share of the credit for results accomplished, would be as reasonable as to say that men who clear the land, plough the ground, and sow the seed, because others may help to gather the harvest, have nothing to do with raising the crop. But for the pioneer work of the Abolitionists there would have been no Republican party.  There had been Anti-Slavery people in this country before the Abolitionists--conscientious, zealous, intelligent--but somehow they lacked the ability, in the language of the pugilists, to \"put up a winning fight.\" They had been brushed aside or trampled under foot. Not so with the Abolitionists. They had learned all the tricks of the enemy. They were not afraid of opposition. They knew how to give blows as well as to take them. The result was that from the time they organized for separate political action in 1840, they had made steady progress, although this seemed for a period to be discouragingly slow. It was only a question of time when, if there had been no Republican party, they would have succeeded in abolishing slavery without its assistance.  Although, as before remarked, the Republican party was made up of a good many elements besides the Abolitionists,"]]]
