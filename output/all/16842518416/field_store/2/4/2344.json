JOHN BEAL  Well, now that you've come we can go ahead.  ARCHIE BEAL  Righto. What at?  JOHN BEAL  We've got to see Hussein's accounts, and get everything clear in black and white, and see just what he owes to Miss Miralda Clement.  ARCHIE BEAL  But they don't keep accounts here.  JOHN BEAL  How do you know?  ARCHIE BEAL  Why, of course they don't. One can see that.  JOHN BEAL  But they must.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, you haven't changed a bit for your six months here.  JOHN BEAL  Haven't changed?  ARCHIE BEAL  No. Just quietly thinking of business. You'll be a great business man, Johnny.  JOHN BEAL  But we must do business; that's what I came here for.  ARCHIE BEAL  You'll never make these people do it.  JOHN BEAL  Well, what do you suggest?  ARCHIE BEAL  Let's have a look at old Hussein.  JOHN BEAL  Yes, that's what I have been waiting for. Daoud!  DAOUD [off]  Master. [Enters.]  JOHN BEAL  Go to the palace of the Lord of the pass and beat on the outer door. Say that I desire to see him. Pray him to come to my tent.  [DAOUD bows and Exit.]  [To ARCHIE.] I've sent him to the palace to ask Hussein to come.  ARCHIE BEAL  Lives in a palace, does he?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, it's a palace, it's a wonderful place. It's bigger than the Mansion House, much.  ARCHIE BEAL  And you're going to teach him to keep accounts.  JOHN BEAL  Well, I must. I hate doing it. It seems almost like being rude to the Lord Mayor. But there's two things I can't stand--cheating in business is one and murder's another. I've got to interfere. You see, if one happens to know the right from wrong as we do, we've simply got to tell people who don't. But it isn't pleasant. I almost wish I'd never come.  ARCHIE BEAL  Why, it's the greatest sport in the world. It's splendid.  JOHN BEAL  I don't see it that way. To me those idols are just horrid murder. And this man owes money to this girl with no one to look after her, and he's got to pay. But I hate being rude to a man in a place like the Mansion House, even if he is black. Why, good Lord, who am I? It seems such cheek.  ARCHIE BEAL  I say, Johnny, tell me about the lady. Is she pretty?  JOHN BEAL  What, Miss Miralda? Yes.  ARCHIE BEAL  But what I mean is--what's she like?  JOHN BEAL  Oh, I don't know. It's very hard to say. She's, she's tall and she's fair and she's got blue eyes.  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, but I mean what kind of a person is she? How does she strike you?  JOHN BEAL  Well, she's pretty hard up until she gets this money, and she hasn't got any job that's any good, and no real prospects bar this, and nobody particular by birth, and doesn't know anybody who is, and lives in the least fashionable suburb and can only just afford a second-class fare and...  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, yes, go on.  JOHN BEAL  And yet somehow she sort of seems like a--like a queen.  ARCHIE BEAL  Lord above us! And what kind of a queen?  JOHN BEAL  O, I don't know. Well, look here, ARCHIE, it's only my impression. I don't know her well yet. It's only my impression. I only tell you in absolute confidence. You won't pass it on to anybody, of course.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, no. Go on.  JOHN BEAL  Well, I don't know, only she seemed more like well, a kind of autocrat, you know, who'd stop at nothing. Well, no, I don't mean that, only...  ARCHIE BEAL  So you're not going to marry her?  JOHN BEAL  Marry her! Good Lord, no. Why, you'd never dare ask her. She's not that sort. I tell you she's a sort of queen. And (Good Lord!) she'd be a queen if it wasn't for Hussein, or something very like one. We can't go marrying queens. Anyhow, not one like her.  ARCHIE BEAL  Why not one like her?  JOHN BEAL  I tell you--she's a--well, a kind of goddess. You couldn't ask her if she loved you. It would be such, such...  ARCHIE BEAL  Such what?  JOHN BEAL  Such infernal cheek.  ARCHIE BEAL  I see. Well, I see you aren't in love with her. But it seems to me you'll be seeing a good deal of her some day if we pull this off. And then, my boy-o, you'll be going and getting in love with her.  JOHN BEAL  I tell you I daren't. I'd as soon propose to the Queen of Sheba.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, Johnny, I'm going to protect you from her all I can.  JOHN BEAL  Protect me from her? Why?  ARCHIE BEAL  Why, because there's lots of other girls and it seems to me you might be happier with some of them.  JOHN BEAL  But you haven't even seen her.  ARCHIE BEAL  Nor I have. Still, if I'm here to protect you I somehow think I will. And if I'm not ...  JOHN BEAL  Well, and what then?  ARCHIE BEAL  What nonsense I'm talking. Fate does everything. I can't protect you.  JOHN BEAL  Yes, it's nonsense all right, ARCHIE, but...  HUSSEIN [off]  I am here.  JOHN BEAL  Be seen.  [HUSSEIN enters. He is not unlike Bluebeard.]  JOHN BEAL [pointing to ARCHIE] My brother.  [ARCHIE shakes hands with HUSSEIN. HUSSEIN looks at his hand when it is over in a puzzled way. JOHN BEAL and Hussein then bow to each other.]  HUSSEIN  You desired my presence.  JOHN BEAL  I am honoured.  HUSSEIN  And I.  JOHN BEAL  The white traveller, whom we call Hinnard, lent you one thousand greater gold pieces, which in our money is one hundred thousand pounds, as you acknowledge. [Hussein nods his head.] And every year you were to pay him for this two hundred and fifty of your greater gold pieces--as you acknowledge also.  HUSSEIN  Even so.  JOHN BEAL  And this you have not yet had chance to pay, but owe it still.  HUSSEIN  I do.  JOHN BEAL  And now Hinnard is dead.  HUSSEIN  Peace be with him.  JOHN BEAL  His heiress is Miss Miralda Clement, who instructs me to be her agent. What have you to say?  HUSSEIN  Peace be with Hinnard.  JOHN BEAL  You acknowledge your debt to this lady, Miss Miralda Clement?  HUSSEIN  I know her not.  JOHN BEAL  You will not pay your debt?  HUSSEIN  I will pay.  JOHN BEAL  If you bring the gold to my tent, my brother will take it to Miss Clement.  HUSSEIN  I do not pay to Miss Clement.  JOHN BEAL  To whom do you pay?  HUSSEIN  I pay to Hinnard.  JOHN BEAL  Hinnard is dead.  HUSSEIN  I pay to Hinnard.  JOHN BEAL  How will you pay to Hinnard?  HUSSEIN  If he be buried in the sea...  JOHN BEAL  He is not buried at sea.  HUSSEIN  If he be buried by any river I go to the god of rivers.  JOHN BEAL  He is buried on land near no river.  HUSSEIN  Therefore I will go to a bronze god of earth, very holy, having the soil in his care and the things of earth. I will take unto him the greater pieces of gold due up to the year when the white traveller died, and will melt them in fire at his feet by night on the mountains, saying, \"O, Lruru-onn (this is his name) take this by the way of earth to the grave of Hinnard.\" And so I shall be free of my debt before all gods.  JOHN BEAL  But not before me. I am English. And we are greater than gods.  ARCHIE BEAL  What's that, Johnny?  JOHN BEAL  He won't pay, but I told him we're English and that they're greater than all his bronze gods.  ARCHIE BEAL  That's right, Johnny.  [HUSSEIN looks fiercely at ARCHIE. He sees ARCHIE's hat lying before a big idol. He points at the hat and looks in the face of the idol.]  HUSSEIN [to the idol] Drink! Drink!  [He bows. Exit.]  ARCHIE BEAL  What's that he's saying?  JOHN BEAL [meditatively] O, nothing--nothing.  ARCHIE BEAL  He won't pay, oh?  JOHN BEAL  No, not to Miss Miralda.  ARCHIE BEAL  Who to?  JOHN BEAL  To one of his gods.  ARCHIE BEAL  That won't do.  JOHN BEAL  No.  ARCHIE BEAL  What'll we do?  JOHN BEAL  I don't quite know. It isn't as if we were in England.  ARCHIE BEAL  No, it isn't.  JOHN BEAL  If we were in England...  ARCHIE BEAL  I know; if we were in England you could call a policeman. I tell you what it is, Johnny.  JOHN BEAL  Yes?  ARCHIE BEAL  I tell you what; you want to see more of Miss Clement.  JOHN BEAL  Why?  ARCHIE BEAL  Why, because at the present moment our friend Hussein is a craftier fellow than you, and looks like getting the best of it.  JOHN BEAL  How will seeing more of Miss Miralda help us?  ARCHIE BEAL  Why, because you want to be a bit craftier than Hussein, and I fancy she might make you.  JOHN BEAL  She? How?  ARCHIE BEAL  We're mostly made what we are by some woman or other. We think it's our own cleverness, but we're wrong. As things are you're no match for Hussein, but if you altered...  JOHN BEAL  Why, ARCHIE; where did you get all those ideas from?  ARCHIE BEAL  O, I don't know.  JOHN BEAL  You never used to talk like that.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, well.  JOHN BEAL  You haven't been getting in love, ARCHIE, have you?  ARCHIE BEAL  What are we to do about Hussein?  JOHN BEAL  It's funny your mentioning Miss Miralda. I got a letter from her the same day I got yours.  ARCHIE BEAL  What does she say?  JOHN BEAL  I couldn't make it out.  ARCHIE BEAL  What were her words?  JOHN BEAL  She said she was going into it closer. She underlined closer. What could she mean by that? How could she get closer?  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, the same way as I did.  JOHN BEAL  How do you mean? I don't understand.  ARCHIE BEAL  By coming here.  JOHN BEAL  By coming here? But she can't come here.  ARCHIE BEAL  Why not?  JOHN BEAL  Because it's impossible. Absolutely impossible. Why--good Lord--she couldn't come here. Why, she'd want a chaperon and a house and--and--everything. Good Lord, she couldn't come here. It would be--well it would be impossible--it couldn't be done.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, all right. Then I don't know what she meant.  JOHN BEAL  ARCHIE! You don't really think she'd come here? You don't really think it, do you?  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, it's the sort of thing that that sort of girl might do, but of course I can't say...  JOHN BEAL  Good Lord, ARCHIE! That would be awful.  ARCHIE BEAL  But why?  JOHN BEAL  Why? But what would I do? Where would she go? Where would her chaperon go? The chaperon would be some elderly lady. Why, it would kill her.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, if it did you've never met her, so you needn't go into mourning for an elderly lady that you don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1311"],["title","If: A Play in Four Acts (#5)"],["body"," know; not yet, anyway.  JOHN BEAL  No, of course not. You're laughing at me, ARCHIE. But for the moment I took you seriously. Of course, she won't come. One can go into a thing closely without doing it absolutely literally. But, good Lord, wouldn't it be an awful situation if she did.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, I don't know.  JOHN BEAL  All alone with me here? No, impossible. And the country isn't civilised.  ARCHIE BEAL.  Women aren't civilised.  JOHN BEAL  Women aren't...? Good Lord, ARCHIE, what an awful remark. What do you mean?  ARCHIE BEAL  We're tame, they're wild. We like all the dull things and the quiet things, they like all the romantic things and the dangerous things.  JOHN BEAL  Why, ARCHIE, it's just the other way about.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, yes; we do all the romantic things, and all the dangerous things. But why?  JOHN BEAL  Why? Because we like them, I suppose. I can't think of any other reason.  ARCHIE BEAL  I hate danger. Don't you?  JOHN BEAL  Er--well, yes, I suppose I do, really.  ARCHIE BEAL  Of course you do. We all do. It's the women that put us up to it. She's putting you up to this. And the more she puts you up to the more likely is Hussein to get it in his fat neck.  JOHN BEAL  But--but you don't mean you'd hurt Hussein? Not--not badly, I mean.  ARCHIE BEAL  We're under her orders, Johnny. See what she says.  JOHN BEAL  You, you don't really think she'll come here?  ARCHIE BEAL  Of course I do, and the best thing too. It's her show; she ought to come.  JOHN BEAL  But, but you don't understand. She's just a young girl, A girl like Miss Miralda couldn't come out here over the pass and down these mountains, she'd never stand it, and as for the chaperon... You've never met Miss Miralda.  ARCHIE BEAL  No, Johnny. But the girl that was able to get you to go from Bromley to this place can look after herself.  JOHN BEAL  I don't see what that's got to do with it. She was in trouble and I had to help her.  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, and she'll be in trouble all the way here from Blackheath, and everyone will have to help her.  JOHN BEAL  What beats me is how you can have the very faintest inkling of what she's like without ever having seen her and without my having spoken of her to you for more than a minute.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, Johnny, you're not a romantic bird, you're not a traveller by nature, barring your one trip to Eastbourne, and it was I that took you there. And contrariwise, as they say in a book you've never read, you're a levelheaded business man and a hardworking respectable stay-at-home. You meet a girl in a train, and the next time I see you you're in a place that isn't marked on the map and telling it what gods it ought to worship and what gods it ought to have agnosticism about. Well, I say some girl.  JOHN BEAL  Well, I must say you make the most extraordinary deductions, but it was awfully good of you to come, and I ought to be grateful; and I am, too, I'm awfully grateful; and I ought to let you talk all the rot you like. Go ahead. You shall say what you like and do what you like. It isn't many brothers that would do what you've done.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, that's nothing. I like this country. I'm glad I came. And if I can help you with Hussein, why all the better.  JOHN BEAL  It's an awful country, Archie, but we've got to see this through.  ARCHIE BEAL  Does she know all about Hussein?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, everything. I've written fully.  OMAR [Off]  Al Shaldomir, Al Shaldomir, The nightingales that guard thy ways...  JOHN BEAL [shouting|  O, go away, go away. [To ARCHIE.] I said it was an awful country. They sit down outside one's tent and do that kind of thing for no earthly reason.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, I'd let them sing.  JOHN BEAL  O, you can't have people doing that kind of thing.  OMAR [in doorway]  Master, I go.  JOHN BEAL  But why do you come?  OMAR  I came to sing a joyous song to you, master.  JOHN BEAL  Why did you want to sing me a joyous song?  OMAR  Because a lady is riding out of the West. [Exit.]  JOHN BEAL  A lady out of... Good Lord!  ARCHIE BEAL  She's coming, Johnny.  JOHN BEAL  Coming? Good Lord, no, Archie. He said a lady; there'd be the chaperon too. There'd be two of them if it was Miss Miralda. But he said a lady. One lady. It can't be her. A girl like that alone in Al Shaldomir. Clean off the map. Oh, no, it isn't possible.  ARCHIE BEAL  I wouldn't worry.  JOHN BEAL  Wouldn't worry? But, good Lord, the situation's impossible. People would talk. Don't you see what people would say? And where could they go? Who would look after them? Do try and understand how awful it is. But it isn't. It's impossible. It can't be them. For heaven's sake run out and see if it is; and (good Lord!) I haven't brushed my hair all day, and, and--oh, look at me.  [He rushes to camp mirror. Exit ARCHIE.  JOHN BEAL tidies up desperately.  Enter ARCHIE.]  ARCHIE BEAL  It's what you call THEM.  JOHN BEAL  What I call THEM? Whatever do you mean?  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, it's her. She's just like what you said.  JOHN BEAL  But it can't be. She doesn't ride. She can never have been able to afford a horse.  ARCHIE BEAL  She's on a camel. She'll be here in a moment. [He goes to door.] Hurry up with that hair; she's dismounted.  JOHN BEAL  O, Lord! What's the chaperon like?  ARCHIE BEAL  O, she's attending to that herself.  JOHN BEAL  Attending to it herself? What do you mean?  ARCHIE BEAL  I expect she'll attend to most things.  [Enter HAFIZ EL ALCOLAHN in doorway of tent, pulling back flap a little.]  JOHN BEAL  Who are you?  HAFIZ  I show the gracious lady to your tent.  [Enter MIRALDA CLEMENT, throwing a smile to HAFIZ.]  MIRALDA  Hullo, Mr. Beal.  JOHN BEAL  Er--er--how do you do?  [She looks at ARCHIE.]  O, this is my brother--Miss Clement.  MIRANDA and ARCHIE BEAL  How do you do?  MIRALDA  I like this country.  JOHN BEAL  I'm afraid I hardly expected you.  MIRALDA  Didn't you?  JOHN BEAL  No. You see er--it's such a long way. And wasn't it very expensive?  MIRALDA  Well, the captain of the ship was very kind to me.  JOHN BEAL  O! But what did you do when you landed?  MIRALDA  O, there were some Arabs coming this way in a caravan. They were really very good to me too.  JOHN BEAL  But the camel?  MIRALDA  O, there were some people the other side of the mountains. Everybody has been very kind about it. And then there was the man who showed me here. He's called Hafiz el Alcolahn. It's a nice name, don't you think?  JOHN BEAL  But, you know, this country, Miss Clement, I'm half afraid it's hardly--isn't it, Archie? Er--how long did you think of staying?  MIRALDA  O, a week or so.  JOHN BEAL  I don't know what you'll think of Al Shaldomir. I'm afraid you'll find it...  MIRALDA  Oh, I like it. Just that hollow in the mountains, and the one pass, and no record of it anywhere. I like that. I think it's lovely.  JOHN BEAL  You see, I'm afraid--what I mean is I'm afraid the place isn't even on the map!  MIRALDA  O, that's lovely of it.  JOHN BEAL  All decent places are.  MIRALDA  You mean if a place is on the map we've got to behave accordingly. But if not, why...  JOHN BEAL  Hussein won't pay.  MIRALDA  Let's see Hussein.  JOHN BEAL  I'm afraid he's rather, he's rather a savage-looking brigand.  MIRALDA  Never mind.  [ARCHIE is quietly listening and smiling sometimes.]  Enter DAOUD. He goes up to the unholy heap and takes away two large idols, one under each arm. Exit.]  What's that, Mr. Beal?  JOHN BEAL  O, that. I'm afraid it's rather horrible. I told you it was an awful country. They pray to these idols here, and some are all right, though of course it's terribly blasphemous, but that heap, well, I'm afraid, well that heap is very bad indeed.  MIRALDA  What do they do?  JOHN BEAL  They kill people.  MIRALDA  Do they? How?  JOHN BEAL  I'm afraid they pour their blood down those horrible throats.  MIRALDA  Do they? How do you know?  JOHN BEAL  I've seen them do it, and those mouths are all rusty. But it's all right now. It won't happen any more.  MIRALDA  Won't it? Why not?  JOHN BEAL  Well, I...  ARCHIE BEAL  He's stopped them, Miss Clement. They're all going to be thrown into the river.  MIRALDA  Have you?  JOHN BEAL  Well, yes. I had to. So it's all right now. They won't do it any more.  MIRALDA  H'm.  JOHN BEAL  What, what is it? I promise you that's all right. They won't do that any more.  MIRALDA  H'm. I've never known anyone that tried to govern a country or anything of that sort, but...  JOHN BEAL  Of course, I'm just doing what I can to put them right.... I'd be very glad of your advice... Of course, I'm only here in your name.  MIRALDA  What I mean is that I'd always thought that the one thing you shouldn't do, if you don't mind my saying so...  JOHN BEAL  No, certainly.  MIRALDA  Was to interfere in people's religious beliefs.  JOHN BEAL  But, but I don't think you quite understand. The priests knife these people in the throat, boys and girls, and then acolytes lift them up and the blood runs down. I've seen them.  MIRALDA  I think it's best to leave religion to the priests. They understand that kind of thing.  [JOHN BEAL opens his mouth in horror and looks at ARCHIE. ARCHIE returns the glance; there is very nearly a twinkle in ARCHIE's eyes.]  MIRALDA  Let's see Hussein.  JOHN BEAL  What do you think, Archie?  ARCHIE BEAL  Poor fellow. We'd better send for him.  MIRALDA  Why do you say \"poor fellow\"?  ARCHIE BEAL  Oh, because he's so much in debt. It's awful to be in debt. I'd sooner almost anything happened to me than to owe a lot of money.  MIRALDA  Your remark didn't sound very complimentary.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, I only meant that I'd hate to be in debt. And I should hate owing money to you, Because...  MIRALDA  Why?  ARCHIE BEAL  Because I should so awfully want to pay it.  MIRALDA  I see.  ARCHIE BEAL  That's all I meant.  MIRALDA  Does Hussein awfully want to pay it?  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, no. But he hasn't seen you yet. He will then, of course.  [Enter DAOUD. He goes to the unholy heap.]  JOHN BEAL  Daoud,"]]]
