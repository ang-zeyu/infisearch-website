Chester, unmindful of his wound, had leaped from his cot and now ran outside. Some distance away he saw a figure disappear in the darkness. The lad did not fire a second shot, for at that distance he could not be sure of a hit and he did not wish further to alarm the camp.  Hal struck a light and the two chums looked at each other.  \"Did you get a look at him, Hal?\" asked Chester.  \"No, did you?\"  \"No. He was in the tent for some time, but I waited until I was sure what he was going to do before I fired, though I had him covered all the time.\"  \"You must be losing your eye. At that distance you should you should have potted him without trouble.\"  \"I guess I could have done it this time had I tried,\" returned Chester. \"I shot at his revolver.\"  \"Well, I guess you hit it,\" said Hal. \"There it is, right where he dropped it. But his bullet whistled pretty close to my ear.\"  \"I suppose I shouldn't have taken a chance,\" said Chester. \"Next time I'll shoot to hit something better than a pistol.\"  \"Well, it doesn't make any difference now,\" said Hal. \"He didn't get me. I wonder who he is and what he wanted to shoot me for?\"  \"You've got me, look at the gun and see if there is any mark of identification on it.\"  Hal stooped over and picked up the revolver. He examined it carefully and then passed it to Chester.  \"Can't find anything,\" he said.  Chester examined the weapon with no better success.  \"Well,\" he said at last, slowly, \"there is one thing certain. You've an enemy of some kind in the camp. It will behoove you to be careful in the future.\"  \"I suppose the bullet was meant for me,\" said Hal, \"although, of course it might have been meant for either you or Stubbs.\"  \"Great Scott! What would anybody want to shoot Stubbs for?\"  \"Well, you can search me,\" said Hal with a shrug of his shoulders, \"which may not be very good English, but expresses my sentiments just the same.\"  \"How about Stubbs' conspiracy? Maybe one of the conspirators has caught Stubbs nosing about.\"  \"By Jove! It might be that, after all,\" said Hal. \"I wonder!\"  \"At all events, we shall all have to be on our guard,\" declared Chester. \"We don't know for which of us the bullet was meant. We'll have to warn Stubbs.\"  \"So we shall, and if I mistake not here he comes now.\"  Hal was right. A moment later the rotund face of the little war correspondent appeared in the tent entrance.  \"Stubbs,\" said Hal gravely, \"you missed getting killed by just about five minutes.\"  The little man started back in alarm.  \"Wha--what's that?\" he demanded.  \"I said you just escaped getting killed.\"  \"But who would want to kill me?\" demanded Stubbs, plainly very nervous.  \"It might have been one of your conspirators,\" said Hal. He displayed the weapon from which a bullet had sped toward his own head.  \"Hey!\" shouted Stubbs. \"Put that gun down! Don't shoot!\"  The little man was so visibly frightened that Hal looked at him in surprise.  \"Surely you didn't think I was going to shoot you, Mr. Stubbs?\" he asked in some surprise.  \"I don't know,\" returned Stubbs, wiping a moist brow with his handkerchief. \"I don't understand you fellows at all. First you said you wanted to kill me five minutes ago and there you stand with a gun in your hand. What am I to think?\"  \"Stubbs, you're crazy,\" said Hal, calmly. \"I didn't say I wanted to kill you. When I came into the tent just now there was a man took a shot at me. I don't know whether he wanted to kill me, or whether he wanted to kill you. He may even have been trying to kill Chester. He didn't take time to investigate. He fired at the first figure to enter the tent. I don't know who he was. Have you any enemies?\"  \"I--I--Why I don't know,\" said Stubbs.  \"How about the conspirators. Do any of them know you?\"  \"What conspirators?\" demanded Stubbs, and added, \"I wish you would quit harping on that subject. It's all right to have a little fun with me once in a while. I don't mind it; but enough is enough.\"  Chester was about to make an angry retort, but Hal stayed him with a word.  \"All right, Stubbs,\" he said. \"If you don't know anything about a conspiracy you don't and that's all there is about that. But if you do, I should advise you to be careful. I believe that shot was meant for you.\"  \"I am afraid that this tent is going to be dangerous for me,\" said Stubbs, slowly. \"I shall remain here no longer.\"  \"What! Not going to leave us, Stubbs?\" exclaimed Chester.  \"Yes,\" returned the little man quietly. \"If I remain here I'm liable to wake up dead some morning, and I wouldn't like that. There's an expression in New York that hits me just right. 'Safety first!' I'm going to get out of this tent, and I'm going to get out right now, while I'm all together.\"  He hurried to the far side of the tent and got his belongings together. Then he moved toward the door. There he paused a moment, as if undecided, then walked up to Hal and extended a hand.  \"Good-bye, Hal,\" he said quietly. \"I may not see you for some time and then again it may be soon.\"  Hal took the hand as he said:  \"Look here, Stubbs, we don't like to lose you.\"  \"I know, I know,\" said the little man, \"but it will be better for all concerned.\"  He approached Chester and extended a hand to him also.  \"Come now, Stubbs,\" said Chester. \"Drop those things back down there and go to bed.\"  \"Not much,\" replied Stubbs grimly. \"I'm going to hunt a safer spot than this.\"  He released Chester's hand and made his way to the door. There, just before moving away, he turned and spoke.  \"Boys,\" he said, \"we've been pretty good friends, the three of us, haven't we?\"  \"You bet we have, Stubbs,\" returned Chester warmly.  \"We certainly have, Mr. Stubbs,\" Hal agreed.  \"All right, then,\" said the little man. \"You both have been good enough to tell me once or twice that I have been of some service to you.\"  \"You certainly have, Mr. Stubbs,\" declared Hal, \"and anything we can do to repay you--\"  \"Never mind that,\" said Stubbs with a wave of the hand. \"All I want to say is this: If, at any time, within a day or two or within a month or two, I do anything you don't like, anything that puts you to some inconvenience--you will know that I am doing it for your own good--because I am fond of both of you and don't want to see you get in trouble.\"  \"Say, Stubbs, what on earth are you talking about?\" asked Chester in great surprise.  \"Never mind what I'm talking about,\" returned Stubbs, half angrily. \"I just want you to remember what I am saying.\"  \"We'll remember, if that will do you any good,\" said Chester, \"but I wish you would tell me what it is all about.\"  \"I may not be talking about anything, and then I may be talking about a whole lot,\" was Stubbs' enigmatical response. \"Time will tell.\"  \"Time will tell what, Mr. Stubbs?\" demanded Hal.  \"Oh, rats!\" said Stubbs. \"I haven't time to stay here and talk to you fellows all night. Just remember what I said. That's all.\"  He stepped out the tent and was gone.  Hal and Chester gazed at one another in the utmost surprise.  \"What in the time of the Czar do you suppose he was talking about?\" asked Chester.  \"I'm not good at conundrums,\" replied Hal. \"He's got something on his mind, all right.\"  \"Providing he has a mind left,\" agreed Chester.  Hal smiled.  \"From the way he talked that fact is open to doubt,\" he replied.  \"I didn't think he was a drinking man,\" said Chester.  \"Oh, he was sober enough. By the way, did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he had any enemies?\"  \"By George! I did. He couldn't answer. I'll bet he knows more about the man that fired that shot at you than he is willing to admit.\"  \"It looks like it,\" Hal agreed. \"From his actions, I would judge that the shot was meant for him.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Chester, \"and he knows who it was that fired it.\"  \"Well, there is no use talking about it,\" declared Hal. \"We can't possibly figure it out ourselves. One thing, though, we shall have to be on our guard. The unknown enemy may not know that Stubbs has moved and may try again.\"  \"Right,\" said Chester. \"We'll have to sleep with one eye open.\"  \"Oh, we're safe enough to-night,\" said Hal. \"He'll figure we'll be on the watch and will postpone his next visit for a day or two. By the way, old man, how do you feel?\"  \"First rate. I'll be as good as new in the morning.\"  \"I hope so. In that event we had better get a little sleep.\"  \"Then you don't think it necessary for one of us to stand watch?\"  \"No; here goes for bed.\"     CHAPTER IX  IN THE TRENCHES   In some manner, known only to himself, Anthony Stubbs, war correspondent of the New York _Gazette_, had ingratiated himself with General Petain, the French commander at Verdun. General Petain, upon Stubbs' request, agreed that the little war correspondent should be allowed to make a tour of the city of Verdun and the surrounding fortifications and view for himself the effects of the siege thus far.  An officer of the general staff was assigned by the French commander to show Stubbs about. It was the first time a war correspondent had been admitted to Verdun and the surrounding fortifications; and because of the things that Stubbs learned on the tour, it is fitting that the reader take the trip with him.  The officer first led Stubbs to the highest point on the walls encircling Verdun and there explained the lay-out of the contending forces. From this point of vantage, commanding the battlefield, Verdun looked like the center of a huge saucer, with the town lying very low, while all around rose an even circle of crests forming the outer edge of the saucer.  The dangerous proximity of the Germans was apparent. At the time that Stubbs viewed the battlefield the armies of the Kaiser held a goodly portion of these crests, though the battle of Verdun was less than two weeks old.  An intermittent bombardment was in progress from Fort Tavennes, Fort Soueville, Fort St. Michael and Fort Belleville, which were barking steadily and giving off jets of black smoke. The German cannonade sounded like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13020"],["title","The Boy Allies at Verdun; Or, Saving France from the Enemy (#8)"],["body"," distant roar. The shelling of Verdun was continuing.  Three hundred shells a day had been hurled into Verdun itself during the battle, Stubbs was informed by the French officer, upon one day as many as 750 having been counted; but the average was 300. As the two stood there a French aeroplane was attacked by a German gun, shrapnel bursting all around as the machine turned from the German positions and darted back to French cover.  The terrible course of the destruction was pointed out by the French officer. The town itself had been abandoned by the civil population, and even few troops were to be found there. Such shops and houses as had escaped the shells were closed and barricaded; and the shells continued to fall.  The streets were crumbling ruins, with only jagged walls remaining here and there. The cathedral had two shell holes in the roof; the main altar was a mass of debris and the side altar was littered with broken carvings, statues and chandeliers.  One wing of the handsome military club was torn off and the whole establishment was a wreck. The archbishop's residence had its famous sculptured walls peppered with shell holes and the adjoining College of Marguerite had its delicate stone filigree reduced almost to powder. The houses along the Meuse, flanking the principal bridge, were literally wrecked.  Sixteen great shells had struck the town hall; one corner of the building had been torn off and the clock tower smashed. The mayor's office was being used as an emergency butcher shop.  Stubbs' guide now led him to one of the inner forts of the fortifications, which was still shelling the Germans. From here Stubbs gained a view of the fighting ground of Fleury at close range. Over the entrance of the fort was a notice to the garrison that the fort was to be levelled in extremity and never surrendered.  Fleury, lying to the right of Verdun, showed not a house standing. The great German guns had carried all before them. The whole village was a mass of ruins. At the moment the village was in the hands of the French. It had been occupied twice by the Germans, but only the day before had again been captured by the French. Although Stubbs did not know it, the little village was to change hands a score of times more in the months that were to follow.  As Stubbs' guide pointed out the various points destroyed by German shells, he gave the little man an account of the fighting in each spot. He pointed out the advantages of earthen breastworks as against the solid walls of fortresses. The effectiveness of the former was very plain.  Stubbs and his guide now returned to the citadel of Verdun, where Stubbs thanked General Petain for being allowed to make the tour of inspection. Gathered about the commander were many members of his staff, who joined in the conversation. Stubbs could not but be impressed by the confidence manifested by the officers that Verdun could be kept from the Germans, and this in the face of the reverses of the past few days. The feeling was summarized in the closing word of General Petain, as he bade Stubbs farewell.  \"_Au revoir_, Monsieur Stubbs,\" he said, \"until you come back when our victory is complete!\"  By a series of fierce counter assaults, the French now had driven the seasoned veterans of the German Crown Prince from Dead Man's Hill; from Hill No. 265, to the north, from Chattancourt and Charny. Back across the Meuse the Germans fled from the vicious attacks of the French. Second and third line trenches were re-won.  But the French did not stop there. The third day of March found them still pushing the Germans and as darkness fell that night, the troops of General Petain entrenched themselves just to the east of Thiaumont farm and Hill No. 320. A trifle to the south, Fleury was once more in German hands, the opposition in this sector having been too much for the French to overcome. Almost due east, German guns, wheeled into position at Fort Vaux, captured the preceding day, shelled the reconquered positions of the French; but the latter stood firm. All night the artillery duel raged and the coming of morning found both armies ready for the day's work.  The French opened the day by concentrating heavy artillery upon the German positions at Fort Vaux. After a two hours' bombardment, the infantry was ordered to the attack. Fresh troops took the places in the trenches vacated by the attacking forces and heavy guns covered their advance.  A hundred yards or so from the hastily constructed German trenches, the thin French lines charged. Their ranks had been sadly depleted as they marched across the open ground, but they stuck to the work bravely. Clear to the German trenches they ran, a second and still a third line close behind; and then the Germans swarmed out to meet them. A fierce hand-to-hand encounter ensued with victory crowning German arms. What was left of the French attacking party scurried back to their own lines.  The Germans did not wait for a second attack. German buglers sounded an advance. Again the Germans swarmed out of their trenches in countless thousands and rushed the French trenches.  Hal and Chester at this moment found themselves at the front with orders for respective divisional commanders. They remained as the Germans charged, sheltered by the huge earthen breastworks.  The fate of the German charge was the same as that of the French a short while before. Beaten off after a half hour of fierce fighting, the Germans retired to the shelter of their own lines. The great German guns, silent while the infantry was engaged, opened up anew on the French trenches, dropping shells in profusion.  Hal and Chester stood elbow to elbow watching the destructive work of the giant shells. Of a sudden a shell dropped close to them. Hal uttered a cry of alarm and made a desperate attempt to drag Chester out of harm's way. In this he was partly successful and they had dashed forward a few yards before the shell exploded.  With the fury of the blast, great clouds of earth flew high in the air. Hal and Chester felt the ground open up beneath them and they gasped for breath as they were precipitated into what seemed a bottomless pit. How far they fell they could not tell, but it seemed a long ways; and hardly had they struck bottom when a shower of earth fell upon them.  Fortunately for them, they were in a section of the trench that was protected on either side by artificial abuttments of hard dirt and stones thrown up by the troops and these caught heavy beams and rocks and other debris that would have showered down upon them and crushed them to death. A great log, or such it appeared, came down lengthwise and struck the abuttments on either side of the pit into which the lads had fallen; a second did likewise and these prevented the shower of rocks and pieces of big guns from going through. It was all that saved the lads.  Then more earth fell and covered these and the pit was effectually sealed. Below there was no light, and when Hal and Chester regained their feet neither could see light above. They groped for each other in the dark and at last clasped hands.  \"Great Scott! What's happened?\" gasped Chester. \"Where are we?\"  \"We are in a pit caused by the explosion of that shell,\" said Hal, quietly. \"The next question is how to get out.\"  He put a hand above his head, but could touch nothing. He tried jumping, but with no better success.  \"I can't reach the top,\" he said.  The lads felt around the sides of the pit. The walls were sheer. It was useless to think of getting up that way.  \"Well, we're up against it,\" said Hal. \"I don't know how we are to get out of here. By Jove! It's lucky we weren't killed by the shell.\"  \"We might just as well have been as to die down here,\" said Chester.  \"Buck up, old man,\" said Hal. \"We're not dead yet and while there's life there's hope. We've been in some ticklish positions before and pulled through all right.\"  \"We were never in a hole like this before,\" said Chester.  Hal had made his way to one side of the pit.  \"Here,\" he called to Chester, \"you climb up on my shoulders and see if you can reach the top.\"  Chester did as Hal suggested and his efforts were rewarded by touching something overhead.  \"What luck?\" asked Hal.  \"Good,\" said Chester. \"I have touched something. Feels like a log.\"  \"Can you pull it loose?\"  \"If I do we're likely to be crushed down here.\"  \"If you don't we're likely to suffocate down here,\" returned Hal. \"I can scarcely get my breath now. We'll have to take a chance.\"  \"Then I'll have a try at it,\" said Chester. \"Be ready to crouch close to the side of the pit when I give the word. I'll come down on top of you and we'll trust to luck that the debris falls clear.\"  \"All right,\" said Hal. \"Yell when you're ready.\"  Again Chester tested the covering with his hands. At last he struck a spot where he could obtain a grip. He decided to throw his weight on it and see if it would come down. He took a firm hold and then called:  \"All right, Hal! Stoop quickly!\"     CHAPTER X  UNEXPECTED VISITORS   Came a low, rumbling sound from overhead and a shower of dirt poured down on Hal as he crouched in his corner. Chester still swung to and fro from above. The lad felt something give, and believing that the mass above was about to fall, he dropped quickly alongside Hal and buried his face in his arms.  But nothing happened.  Directly Chester rose to his feet.  \"I thought it was coming,\" he said to Hal. \"Guess I didn't hang on long enough. I'll have another try. Lend me your shoulders again.\"  Hal also stood up and took his position. Chester clambered up and again explored the covering with his fingers. At the first touch there was another shower of earth.  \"Won't take a whole lot to move it, I guess,\" he said.  \"Hurry, then,\" enjoined Hal. \"The air is stifling down here.\"  Chester himself felt that he was suffocating and realized the need for haste.  \"All right,\" he said. \"Here's hoping we're not crushed to death. Down when I"]]]
