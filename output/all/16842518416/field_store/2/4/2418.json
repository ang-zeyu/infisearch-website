Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add this to the cooking mixture.  When the preparation has cooked for twenty minutes, take it from the fire and add the remainder of the sugar and the cream, which should be gradually beaten into the hot mixture. Set away to cool, and when cold, freeze.   CHOCOLATE CREAM PIES  Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and a cupful and a quarter of powdered sugar. Add two well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of wine, half a cupful of milk, and a cupful and a half of sifted flour, with which has been mixed a teaspoonful and a half of baking powder. Bake this in four well-buttered, deep, tin plates for about fifteen minutes in a moderate oven.  Put half a pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Beat together the yolks of two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a level tablespoonful of flour. Stir this mixture into the boiling milk, beating well. Add one-sixth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cooked, flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Put two of the cakes on two large plates, spread the cream over them, and lay the other two cakes on top. Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into them one cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Shave one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Now add three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and stir into the beaten egg and sugar. Spread on the pies and set away for a few hours.   CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  Put a three-quart mould in a wooden pail, first lining the bottom with fine ice and a thin layer of coarse salt. Pack the space between the mould and the pail solidly with fine ice and coarse salt, using two quarts of salt and ice enough to fill the space. Whip one quart of cream, and drain it in a sieve. Whip again all the cream that drains through. Put in a small pan one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water, and stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add three tablespoonfuls of cream. Sprinkle a cupful of powdered sugar over the whipped cream. Pour the chocolate in a thin stream into the cream, and stir gently until well mixed. Wipe out the chilled mould, and turn the cream into it. Cover, and then place a little ice lightly on top. Wet a piece of carpet in water, and cover the top of the pail. Set away for three or four hours; then take the mould from the ice, dip it in cold water, wipe, and then turn the mousse out on a flat dish.   CHOCOLATE CHARLOTTE  Soak a quarter of a package of gelatine in one-third of a cupful of cold water for two hours. Whip one pint of cream to a froth, and put it in a bowl, which should be placed in a pan of ice-water. Put half an ounce of shaved chocolate in a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water, and stir over the hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add to this a gill of hot milk and the soaked gelatine, and stir until the gelatine is dissolved. Sprinkle a generous half cupful of powdered sugar over the cream. Now add the chocolate and gelatine mixture, and stir gently until it begins to thicken. Line a quart charlotte-mould with lady fingers, and when the cream is so thick that it will just pour, turn it gently into the mould. Place the charlotte in a cold place for an hour or more, and, at serving time, turn out on a flat dish.   CHOCOLATE BAVARIAN CREAM  For one large mould of cream, use half a package of gelatine, one gill of milk, two quarts of whipped cream, one gill of sugar, and two and a half ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate.  Soak the gelatine in cold water for two hours. Whip and drain the cream, scrape the chocolate, and put the milk on to boil. Put the chocolate, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of hot water in a small saucepan, and stir on a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this into the hot milk. Now add the soaked gelatine and the remainder of the sugar. Strain this mixture into a basin that will hold two quarts or more. Place the basin in a pan of ice-water, and stir until cold, when it will begin to thicken. Instantly begin to stir in the whipped cream, adding half the amount at first. When all the cream has been added, dip the mould in cold water and turn the cream into it. Place in the ice-chest for an hour or more.  At serving-time dip the mould in tepid water. See that the cream will come from the sides of the mould, and turn out on a flat dish. Serve with whipped cream.   CHOCOLATE CREAM  Soak a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for two hours. Put one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Shave two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir into the hot milk. Beat the yolks of five eggs with half a cupful of sugar. Add to the gelatine, and stir the mixture into the hot milk. Cook three minutes longer, stirring all the while. On taking from the fire, add two teaspoonfuls of vanilla and half a saltspoonful of salt. Strain, and pour into moulds that have been rinsed in cold water. Set away to harden, and serve with sugar and cream.   CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE  Put one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Sprinkle into it one level tablespoonful of sea-moss farina. Cover, and cook until the mixture looks white, stirring frequently. It will take about twenty minutes. While the milk and farina are cooking, shave two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, then stir into the cooked mixture. Add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Strain, and turn into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water. Set the mould in a cold place, and do not disturb it until the blanc-mange is cold and firm. Serve with sugar and cream.   CHOCOLATE CREAM RENVERSEE  Use one quart of milk, seven eggs, half a pint of sugar, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, half a teaspoonful of salt. Put the milk on the fire in the double-boiler. Shave the chocolate, and put it in a small pan with three tablespoonfuls of the sugar and one of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy; then stir into the hot milk, and take the milk from the fire to cool.  Put three tablespoonfuls of sugar into a charlotte-mould that will hold a little more than a quart, and place on the stove. When the sugar melts and begins to smoke, move the mould round and round, to coat it with the burnt sugar, then place on the table. Beat together the remainder of the sugar, the eggs, and the salt. Add the cold milk and chocolate to the mixture, and after straining into the charlotte-mould, place in a deep pan, with enough tepid water to come nearly to the top of the mould. Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the center. Test the cream by running a knife through the center. If firm and smooth, it is done. It will take forty or forty-five minutes to cook. When icy-cold, turn on a flat dish. Serve with whipped cream that has been flavored with sugar and vanilla.   BAKED CHOCOLATE CUSTARD  For five small custards use one pint of milk, two eggs, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, and a piece of stick cinnamon about an inch long.  Put the cinnamon and milk in the double-boiler, place on the fire and cook for ten minutes. Shave the chocolate, and put it in a small pan with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water. Stir this over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir it into the hot milk, after which take the liquid mixture from the fire and cool.  Beat together with a spoon the eggs, salt and two tablespoonfuls of the sugar. Add the cooled milk and strain. Pour the mixture into the cups, which place in a deep pan. Pour into the pan enough tepid water to come nearly to the top of the cups. Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the center. It will take about half an hour. Test by running a knife through the center. If the custard is milky, it is not done. Serve very cold.   CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÃ‰  Half a pint of milk, two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, one rounding tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, four eggs.  Put the milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Beat the butter to a soft cream, and beat the flour into it. Gradually pour the hot milk on this, stirring all the time. Return to the fire and cook for six minutes. Put the shaved chocolate, sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of water in a small pan over a hot fire, and stir until smooth and glossy. Stir this into the mixture in the double-boiler. Take from the fire and add the yolks of the eggs, well beaten; then set away to cool. When cool add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the batter into a well-buttered earthen dish that will hold about a quart, and cook in a moderate oven for twenty-two minutes. Serve immediately with vanilla cream sauce.   CHOCOLATE PUDDING  Reserve one gill of milk from a quart, and put the remainder on the fire in a double-boiler. Mix three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with the cold milk. Beat two eggs with half a cupful of powdered sugar and half a teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the cornstarch and milk, and stir into the boiling milk, beating well for a minute. Shave fine two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],["title","Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#4)"],["body","of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy; then beat into the hot pudding. Cook the pudding in all ten minutes, counting from the time the eggs and cornstarch are added. Serve cold with powdered sugar and cream. This pudding can be poured while hot into little cups which have been rinsed in cold water. At serving time turn out on a flat dish, making a circle, and fill the center of the dish with whipped cream flavored with sugar and vanilla.  The eggs may be omitted, in which case use one more tablespoonful of cornstarch.   CHOCOLATE MERINGUE PUDDING  For a small pudding use one pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls and a half of cornstarch, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, two eggs, five tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract.  Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the milk on to boil in the double-boiler. Scrape the chocolate. When the milk boils, add the cornstarch, salt, and chocolate, and cook for ten minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs with three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Pour the hot mixture on this, and beat well. Turn into a pudding-dish that will hold about a quart, and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate oven.  Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, and gradually beat in the remaining two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the vanilla. Spread this on the pudding, and return to the oven. Cook for fifteen minutes longer, but with the oven-door open. Serve either cold or hot.   MILTON PUDDING  Use one pint of stale bread broken in crumbs, one quart of milk, two eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, grated. Put the bread, milk, cinnamon, and chocolate in a bowl, and soak for two or three hours. Beat together the eggs, sugar, and salt. Mash the soaked bread with a spoon, and add the egg mixture to the bread and milk. Pour into a pudding-dish, and bake in a slow oven for about forty minutes. Serve with an egg sauce or a vanilla cream sauce.  EGG SAUCE.--Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff, dry froth; and beat into this, a little at a time, one cupful of powdered sugar. When smooth and light, add one teaspoonful of vanilla and the yolks of two eggs. Beat the mixture a little longer; then stir in one cupful of whipped cream or three tablespoonfuls of milk. Serve at once.  VANILLA CREAM SAUCE.--Beat to a cream three tablespoonfuls of butter, and gradually beat into this two-thirds of a cupful of powdered sugar. When this is light and creamy, add a teaspoonful of vanilla; then gradually beat in two cupfuls of whipped cream. Place the bowl in a pan of boiling water, and stir constantly for three minutes. Pour the sauce into a warm bowl, and serve.   SNOW PUDDING  Put a pint of milk in the double-boiler and on the fire. Mix three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with a gill of milk and one-third of a teaspoonful of salt. Stir this into the milk when it boils. Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and then gradually beat into them half a cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Add this to the cooking mixture, and beat vigorously for one minute. Rinse a mould in cold water, and pouring the pudding into it, set away to cool. At serving-time turn out on a flat dish, and serve with chocolate sauce.   CHOCOLATE SAUCE  Put one pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Shave two ounces of Walter Baker and Co.'s Chocolate, and put it in a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir over the fire until smooth and glossy, and add to the hot milk. Beat together for eight minutes the yolks of four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a saltspoonful of salt, and then add one gill of cold milk.  Pour the boiling milk on this, stirring well. Return to the double-boiler, and cook for five minutes, stirring all the time. Pour into a cold bowl and set the bowl in cold water. Stir for a few minutes, and then occasionally until the sauce is cold.  This sauce is nice for cold or hot cornstarch pudding, bread pudding, cold cabinet pudding, snow pudding, etc. It will also answer for a dessert. Fill custard glasses with it, and serve the same as soft custard; or have the glasses two-thirds full, and heap up with whipped cream.   CHOCOLATE CANDY  One cupful of molasses, two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of milk, one-half pound of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg. Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the chocolate fine, and mix with just enough of the boiling milk and molasses to moisten; rub it perfectly smooth, then, with the sugar, stir into the boiling liquid; add the butter, and boil twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy, and if it hardens, pour into a buttered dish. Cut the same as nut candy.   CREAM CHOCOLATE CARAMELS  Mix together in a granite-ware saucepan half a pint of sugar, half a pint of molasses, half a pint of thick cream, one generous tablespoonful of butter, and four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Place on the fire and stir until the mixture boils. Cook until a few drops of it will harden if dropped into ice-water; then pour into well-buttered pans, having the mixture about three-fourths of an inch deep. When nearly cold, mark into squares. It will take almost an hour to boil this in a granite-ware pan, but not half so long if cooked in an iron frying-pan. Stir frequently while boiling. The caramels must be put in a very cold place to harden.   SUGAR CHOCOLATE CARAMELS  Mix two cupfuls of sugar, three-fourths of a cupful of milk or cream, one generous tablespoonful of butter, and three ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Place on the fire and cook, stirring often, until a little of the mixture, when dropped in ice-water, will harden; then stir in one-fourth of a cupful of sugar and one tablespoonful of vanilla, and pour into a well-buttered pan, having the mixture about three-fourths of an inch deep. When nearly cold, mark it off in squares, and put in a cold place to harden. These caramels are sugary and brittle, and can be made in the hottest weather without trouble. If a deep granite-ware saucepan be used for the boiling, it will take nearly an hour to cook the mixture; but if with an iron frying-pan, twenty or thirty minutes will suffice.   CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 1  Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Gradually beat into this two cupfuls of confectioners' sugar. If the eggs be large, it may take a little more sugar. Flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and work well. Now roll into little balls, and drop on a slightly buttered platter. Let the balls stand for an hour or more. Shave five ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate and put into a small bowl, which place on the fire in a saucepan containing boiling water. When the chocolate is melted, take the saucepan to the table, and drop the creams into the chocolate one at a time, taking them out with a fork and dropping them gently on the buttered dish. It will take half an hour or more to harden the chocolate.   CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 2  For these creams you should make a fondant in this way: put into a granite-ware saucepan one cupful of water and two of granulated sugar--or a pound of loaf sugar. Stir until the sugar is nearly melted, then place on the fire and heat slowly, but do not stir the mixture. Watch carefully and note when it begins to boil. When the sugar has been boiling for ten minutes, take up a little of it and drop in ice-water. If it hardens enough to form a soft ball when rolled between the thumb and finger, it is cooked enough. Take the saucepan from the fire instantly, and set in a cool, dry place. When the syrup is so cool that the finger can be held in it comfortably, pour it into a bowl, and stir with a wooden spoon until it becomes thick and white. When it begins to look dry, and a little hard, take out the spoon, and work with the hand until the cream is soft and smooth. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla, and, after shaping, cover with chocolate, as directed in the preceding recipe.  _Caution._--Do not stir the syrup while it is cooking, and be careful not to jar or shake the saucepan.   CHOCOLATE CONES  Boil the sugar as directed for fondant in the recipe for Chocolate Creams, No. 2, but not quite so long--say about eleven minutes. The syrup, when tested, should be too soft to ball. When cold, pour into a bowl, and beat until thick and creamy. If properly boiled, it will not become thick enough to work with the hands.  Have six ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate melted in a bowl. Pour half of the creamed sugar into another bowl, and, after flavoring with a few drops of vanilla, add to it about one-third of the dissolved chocolate. Stir until thick and rather dry; then make into small cones, and drop on a slightly buttered platter. Put half of the remaining creamed sugar in a cup, and set in a saucepan containing boiling water. Flavor with vanilla, and stir over the fire until melted so much that it will pour from the spoon. Take the saucepan to the table and dip one-half the cones in, one at a time, just as the Chocolate Creams, No. 1, were dipped in the melted chocolate. If liked, a second coating may be given the cones. Now put the remainder of the creamed sugar on to melt, and add two tablespoonfuls of hot water to it. Stir the remainder of the melted chocolate into this, and if too thick to dip the candy in, add hot water, a few drops at a time, until the mixture is of the right consistency; then dip the rest of the cones in this.   GENESEE BON-BONS  Make the cream chocolate caramels, and get them quite firm by placing the pan on ice. Make the chocolate coating as directed for chocolate cones. Dip the caramels in this and put on a buttered dish.   CHOCOLATE SYRUP  Into a granite-ware saucepan put"]]]
