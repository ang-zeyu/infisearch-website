Corporal Aspen could take the man into the mess-room where none of the men would be disturbed.\"  \"That sounds like a good idea,\" Dick nodded, smiling slightly. \"If he has to lose some of his sleep for instruction Hartley may remember better.  A soldier who offers his salutes in a slovenly fashion is always a long way from being a really good soldier. And, Sergeant, tell all the corporals that each will be held responsible for drill and instruction of their squads in the art of snappy saluting.\"  Glancing at his wrist watch Prescott now noted that it was within five minutes of time for the battalion practice march.  Accordingly he stepped outside.  His lieutenants being already on the drill ground he gave them brief directions as to the instruction to be imparted on the hike and the deficiencies in the men's work that were to be watched for.  While he was still speaking the bugler sounded assembly.  Two or three minutes later the first battalion, under Major Wells, marched off the drill ground in column of fours.  As A company moved off at the head of the battalion some of the non-coms called quietly:  \"Hip!  hip!  hip!\"  At each \"hip\" the men stepped forward on the left foot.  A few of the recruits still found difficulty in keeping step.  \"Let that third four close up!\" ordered Lieutenant Terry briskly. \"Pay more heed to keeping the interval correctly.\"  When the third four closed up those behind closed in accordance, sergeants and corporals giving this matter close attention.  As it was a practice march the men continued to move in step. Company streets were left behind and the battalion moved on across a field, where later a trench system was to be installed, out past where the rifle ranges were already being constructed, and then up the gradual ascent of a low hill from which a spread-out view of the camp was to be had.  On all the out-lying roads, at this time, bodies of troops were to be seen marching in various directions.  At a distance these columns of men, clad in olive drab, made one think of brown caterpillars moving slothfully along. That was a distance effect, however, for the marching men did not move slowly, but kept on at the regular cadence of a hundred and twenty steps to the minute.  In less than ten minutes after the start, with the rays of the sun pouring down mercilessly on them, the soldiers began to perspire freely.  Another five minutes and it was necessary to brush the perspiration out of their eyes.  Assuredly the officers felt the heat as much.  Yet from time to time Captain Prescott fell out from his place at the head of the company and allowed the line to march by, observing every good, indifferent or bad feature of their marching, and correcting what he could by low spoken commands.  Whenever the last of the company had passed Prescott ran along by the marching men until he had gained the head.  If the men suffered acute discomfort in marching Prescott experienced more suffering in running under that hot sun.  But he was intent only on the idea of having the best company in what he fondly hoped would turn out to be the best regiment in the Army.  For some minutes Greg had been aware that Sergeant Mock, of his company, was hobbling along.  Now, as he turned to glance backward, he saw Mock step out of the ranks, go to the side of the road and sit down.  A glance at his wrist watch, and Greg saw that the first half-hour was nearly up.  In a minute or two more, he knew Major Bell would give the order for a counter-march, and the first battalion would swing and come back on its own trail.  So Captain Holmes turned and ran back to his non-commissioned officer.  \"What's the matter, Sergeant?\" the young captain inquired pleasantly.  Mock made as though trying to rise from the ground to stand at attention, but his lips twisted as though he were in pain.  \"Rest,\" ordered Greg, \"and tell me what ails you.\"  \"My feet are killing me, sir,\" groaned the sergeant.  \"That's odd,\" Captain Holmes commented.  \"You were all right at assembly---lively enough then.  Has half an hour of marching used up a sound, healthy man?\"  Instantly the sergeant's look became surly.  \"All I know, sir, is that I could hardly stand on my feet.  So I had to drop out.  If you'll permit it, sir, I shall have to get back to camp the best way I can.\"  \"If you're that badly off I'll have an ambulance sent for you,\" Greg went on.  \"But I don't understand your feet giving out so suddenly.  Take off one of your shoes and the sock.\"  \"That may not show much, but I'm suffering just the same, sir,\" rejoined the non-com in a grumbling tone.  \"Let me see,\" Greg insisted.  While the sergeant was busy removing a legging and unlacing a shoe Captain Holmes glanced up the road to discover that the battalion was counter-marching.  \"Be quick about it, Sergeant,\" Greg urged.  Moving no faster than he had to, Mock took off his shoe, then slowly turned the sock down, peeling it off.  \"Is that the worst foot?\" Greg demanded, in astonishment.  \"I don't know, sir; they both hurt me.\"  \"Do you want to show me the other foot, or do you wish to get back among the file closers?\"  \"I---I can't walk, sir.\"  Down on one knee went Greg, carefully inspecting the foot and feeling it.  The skin was clean, rosy, firm.  \"Why there isn't a sign of a blister,\" Captain Holmes declared. \"Nor is there an abrasion of any kind, or any callous.  There isn't even a corn.  That's as healthy a doughboy foot as I've seen.  Dress your foot again, and put on your legging---_pronto_.\"  A \"doughboy\" is an infantry soldier.  \"Pronto\" is a word the Army has borrowed from the Spanish, and means, \"Be quick about it.\"  \"I'm not fit to march, sir,\" cried Sergeant Mock.  \"Either you'll be ready by the time B company is here, and you'll march in, or I'll detail a man to remain here with you, and send an ambulance for you.  If I have to send an ambulance I'll have you examined at the hospital, and if I find you've been faking foot trouble then you shall feel the full weight of military law. I'll give you your own choice.  Which do you want?\"  Tugging his sock on, Mock merely mumbled.  \"Answer me!\" Greg insisted sharply.  \"I---I'll do my best to march, sir.\"  \"Then be sure you're ready by the time B company gets here, and be sure you march all the way in,\" Greg ordered sternly.  He hated a shamming imitation of a soldier.  Major Bell and his staff came by at the head of the line, followed by Prescott and A company.  \"Don't disappoint me, Sergeant,\" Greg warned his man.  Though his brow was black with wrath Sergeant Mock stood up by the time that the head of B company arrived.  \"Take your place, Sergeant,\" Greg ordered, and waited to see his order obeyed, next running up to his own post.  Ten minutes later, as a group of carpenters from the rifle range paused at the roadside, Greg chanced to glance backward.  He was just in time to see Sergeant Mock limping out of the line of file-closers to sit down at the roadside.  His jaws set, Greg Holmes darted back.  \"That's enough of this, Mock,\" he called.  \"You can't sham in B company.  Your feet, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" groaned the sergeant.  \"First two men of the rear four of B company fall out and come here,\" Captain Holmes shouted.  Instantly the two men detached themselves from the company and came running back.  \"Fix your bayonets,\" Greg ordered.  \"Bring Sergeant Mock in at the rear of the battalion.  If he shirks, prod him with the points of your bayonets.  Don't be brutal, but make the sergeant keep up at the rear of the battalion.\"  \"Sir-----\" began Mock protestingly.  \"Quite enough for you, Sergeant Mock,\"  Greg rapped out.  \"I'll have your feet examined by a surgeon when you come in.  Unless the surgeon tells me that I'm wrong you may look for something to happen!\"  As Greg turned and started to run back to the head of his company he thought he heard a sound like a hiss.  In his opinion it came from some one in the group of carpenters, but he did not halt to investigate.  Though Mock limped all the way in, he came in exactly at the tail of the battalion.  As the last company halted on the drill ground Sergeant Lund came back for him, relieving the guards.  \"Mock, until you've been examined,\" said the top, \"you're not to go beyond battalion bounds.\"  \"Am I in arrest?\" demanded Mock, his face set in ugly lines.  \"You're confined within battalion bounds. Remember that,\" saying which First Sergeant Lund turned and strode away.  Nor was Mock a happy man.  Holmes arranged that a regimental surgeon should come over to B company barracks later and make a careful examination of Sergeant Mock's feet.  For some reason the surgeon did not come promptly.  The evening meal was eaten, and darkness settled down over Camp Berry.  Mock, still limping and looking woeful, kept out in the open air.  \"Psst!\" came sharply from somewhere, and Mock, turning, saw a man in civilian garb standing in the shadow of a latrine shed.  \"Come here,\" called the stranger.  Still surly, but urged by curiosity, Mock obeyed the summons.  \"I don't want to be seen talking with you,\" murmured the stranger, in a low voice, \"but I want to offer you my sympathy.  Say, but a man gets treated roughly in the Army.  That captain of yours---\"  As the stranger paused, looking keenly at Mock, the disgruntled sergeant finished vengefully:  \"The captain?  He's a dog!\"  \"Dog is right,\" agreed the stranger promptly.  \"Will he do anything more to you?\"  \"I expect he'll bust me,\" said Sergeant Mock.  To \"bust\" is the same as to \"break.\" It means to reduce a non-com to the ranks.  \"Are you going to stand it?\" demanded the stranger.  \"Fat chance I'll have to beat the captain's game!\" declared Mock angrily.  \"But are you going to pay him back?\"  \"How?\"  \"Listen.  I was in the Army once, and I don't like these officer boys.  Maybe I've something against your captain, too.  Anyway, keep mum and take"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12810"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys with Pershing's Troops (#4)"],["body","advice, and I'll help you to make him wish he'd never been born.\"  \"Not a chance!\" dissented Sergeant Mock promptly.  \"Captain Holmes isn't afraid of anything, and besides he was born lucky.  Besides that, do anything to hurt him, and you've got Captain Prescott against you, too, and ready to rip you up the back.\"  \"It's as easy to put 'em both in bad as it is to do it to either,\" promised the stranger.  \"Now, listen.  You-----\"     CHAPTER III  BAD BLOOD COMES TO THE SURFACE   Later in the evening the surgeon came around.  After examining Sergeant Mock's feet for twenty minutes, and testing the skin as well, he pronounced Mock a shammer.  Mock was sent to the guard-house for twenty-four hours.  The next morning an order was published reducing the sergeant to the rank of private.  Yet, on the whole, the ex-sergeant looked pleased in a sullen, disagreeable sort of way.  He had listened to the stranger.  Greg, however, had other troubles on his hands.  After the noon meal that day, as he was on his way to his quarters upstairs Captain Cartwright passed him in the corridor.  \"I hear you're turning martinet,\" said Cartwright, with a disagreeable smile.  \"Very likely,\" smiled Holmes, \"but what are the specifications?\"  \"I heard that you had a sergeant busted for having an opinion of his own.\"  \"That's not so,\" Greg declared promptly.  \"Do you mean to tell me I'm a liar?\" Cartwright asked flushing.  \"Did I understand you to charge me with preferring unjustifiable charges against a sergeant in my company?\"  \"I said I heard you had busted a sergeant for doing his own thinking,\" the other captain insisted.  \"Cartwright, it's difficult for me to guess at what you're driving,\" Holmes went on, patiently, \"but I've already told you that I did nothing of the kind that you allege.\"  \"That's calling me a liar again!\" flamed Cartwright.  \"I'm sorry if it is,\" returned Greg coolly, and turned toward his door.  \"You cannot call me a liar!\" cried Captain Cartwright, taking a quick step forward, his fists clenched.  \"Apparently I don't have to,\" scoffed Holmes.  \"You're eager to claim the title for yourself.\"  Up flew the other captain's fist.  But just then a door opened behind him, and Dick Prescott caught the uplifted fist in tight, vise-like hold.  \"Don't do that, Cartwright,\" he advised.  \"Let me alone,\" insisted the other striving though failing to release his captured wrist.  \"Don't do anything rash, Cartwright.  Listen to good sense; then I am going to let go of your wrist.  If you were to strike Holmes he would be practically bound to thrash you, or else to prefer charges.  In either case the matter would get before a court-martial. My testimony, from what I overheard, would have to sustain Holmes.\"  \"You two would swear for each other anywhere and at all times,\" sneered Captain Cartwright.  This was hinting that Dick Prescott would be willing to perjure himself, and Dick flushed, though with difficulty he kept his patience.  \"I'm going to let go of you now, Cartwright,\" Prescott continued.  As Dick let go of the captured wrist Captain Cartwright wheeled and aimed a vicious blow at his brother officer's face.  But Prescott's arm thrust up his adversary's.  \"Stop it, Cartwright!\"  Apparently the other could not control his anger.  He aimed another savage blow.  Dick parried with a thrust, but this time his other fist landed on Cartwright's chest with force enough to send him staggering to a fall on the floor.  At this moment a step was heard on the stairway.  \"Gentlemen!  Stop this!  What does it mean?\"  The voice was full of authority and outraged dignity.  Colonel Cleaves, his eyes flashing, stood before them.  \"Get up, Captain Cartwright,\" he commanded.  \"I must have an instant explanation of this scene.  Officers and gentlemen cannot conduct themselves like rowdies.\"  Captain Cartwright forced himself to smile as he saluted; he even tried to look forgiving.  \"A little frolic, sir,\" he made haste to say, \"that developed into bad blood for the moment.\"  I do not wish to prefer any charges.\"  \"Do you, Captain Prescott?\" demanded the colonel.  \"No, sir.\"  \"You, Captain Holmes?\"  \"No, sir.\"  If any of the trio had hoped this much explanation would prove satisfactory to the E.O. of the Ninety-ninth, that one had reckoned without his host.  \"A misunderstanding that develops to the point of a knock-down blow is never a trifling matter,\" declared Colonel Cleaves.  \"If you gentlemen had assured me that it was all frolic then I would have thought no more of it.  But I have been assured that there was a misunderstand---a quarrel that proceeded to blows.  And I myself saw one man down and signs of very evident anger on all your faces.  Gentlemen, do you wish to offer me any further explanation at this moment?\"  \"I have said all that I really can say, sir,\" protested Cartwright, \"except that I do not harbor any unkind feelings for what has taken place.\"  Steps were heard on the stairs, and other officers of the Ninety-ninth came upon the scene.  \"As no charges have been preferred,\" said Colonel Cleaves, \"I will not order any of you relieved from duty.  I will notify all three of you, however, at a later hour, and will then hear you all in my office.  I trust a most satisfactory explanation all around will be forthcoming.\"  Colonel Cleaves then turned to the group of officers that had just arrived, saying:  \"Lieutenant Terry, you were kind enough to offer to loan me a book on rifle range construction.  I am aware that you have not yet had a chance to send it over to me, but as I was passing, I decided to drop in and ask it from you.\"  \"In an instant, sir,\" replied Noll Terry.  Saluting, he darted down the corridor, opened his door and came back with the volume.  \"I am indebted to you, Mr. Terry,\" said Colonel Cleaves, returning the first lieutenant's second salute and turning to go.  Until they had heard the colonel go out upon the steps below the entire group of younger officers stood as though spell-bound. But at last one of them broke out with:  \"I hope nothing really nasty is afoot.  Three of you look as though the moon were clouded with mischief for some one.\"  \"You'll pardon us, won't you?\" smiled Dick pleasantly, as he turned to go back into his quarters.  \"You will realize, as we do, that the first discussion of the matter should take place before the commanding officer.\"  Greg followed his chum in.  \"Oh it's nothing,\" they heard Captain Cartwright assure the others. \"It ought to blow over, and I hope it will.  A certain officer took what I thought too much liberty with me, and when I resented it his friend took a hand in the matter.  I hope we can set it all straight before Colonel Cleaves.\"  Behind the closed door, hearing what was said, Prescott turned on his friend with eyebrows significantly raised.  Greg nodded. No word was spoken.  Apparently Captain Cartwright also went to his quarters, for the steps of many sounded outside, and then all was still.  Prescott had picked up a book and was reading.  Greg walked over to the window and stood looking out into the sun-baked company street.  \"I must go over to company office for an hour or so,\" announced Captain Dick, glancing at his wrist watch and laying down his book at last.  \"After that I'll go out and see how the platoon commanders are getting along with their new work.  I hear that we're to have some drafts of new men to-morrow.\"  \"Yes,\" Greg nodded.  \"Recruits from Chicago, and also from Boston. Some day we may hope to have our companies filled up to full strength.\"  \"Small chance to get over to France until our companies are filled,\" Prescott smiled, as he stood up, looked himself over and started for the door.  Captain Greg Holmes followed at his heels.  No word was spoken of the recent trouble with Cartwright, not even when they crossed the road below and started for their respective company offices.  Paper work engrossed Prescott's attention for an hour or so. During this time he occasionally glanced up to note what was taking place beyond the window in front of his desk.  His four second lieutenants were in command of the platoons to-day, instead of sergeants.  The young officers were instructing their men in the first essentials of bayonet combat.  The last piece of paper disposed of, Prescott at last arose, stretched slightly, then strode out of the office to the drill ground.  He was just in time to hear one of his lieutenants explaining to a line of men:  \"When pursuing a retreating enemy one of the most effective thrusts with the bayonet can be delivered right here.  Learn to mark the spot well.\"  Half-turning, the lieutenant pointed to the spot in the small of his own back, before he went on, impressively:  \"A bayonet thrust there will drive the blade through a kidney. I will admit that that doesn't sound like sportsman-like fighting, but unfortunately we're not to be employed against a really civilized enemy in this war.  Page, you will stand out.  It isn't a popular role to which I am going to assign you, but you will run slowly past me and represent a fleeing enemy.  Dobson, you will take a blob-stick and chase Page, running just fast enough to overtake him in front of me.  Then you will give him the kidney thrust, taking care to make your aim exact.  Thrust with spirit, but do not hit hard, even with the blob-stick, for Page is not a real German.\"  Though the men were perspiring uncomfortably, their officer's pleasant conversational way and his interesting talk kept the interest of these young soldiers.  Private Page stepped out and took post where the lieutenant indicated, prepared to begin running away at the word of command.  Private Dobson picked up a blob-stick, a long, wand-like affair intended to represent a rifle and bayonet, the bayonet's point being represented by a padded ball such as is seen on a bass drummer's stick.  \"Go ahead, Page,\" commanded the lieutenant.  \"Kill him, Dobson! . . . Good work!  Any enemy, struck like that in"]]]
