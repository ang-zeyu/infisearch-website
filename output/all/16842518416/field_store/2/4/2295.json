Style and poetry had a great effect upon him; he expressed      admiration for the form and was aroused to enthusiasm by      generous or noble ideas. Frederick the Great was the hero of      his choice, a model of which he never ceased dreaming, and      which, like his grandfather, he proposed as his own. It is      easy to conceive that after ten or twelve years of such      study, regularly and methodically pursued, the Prince must      have possessed a literary and scientific baggage more varied      and extensive than that of his companions. And he worked      hard for it, few lads so hard. To speak the truth, he was      much more disciplined and much more deprived of freedom and      recreation of all sorts than most children of his age.\"  _Par paranthèse_ may be introduced here a reference to Prince Henry, of whom Monsieur Ayme writes less enthusiastically.       \"One day,\" the tutor writes, \"I was dictating to him      something in which mention of a queen occurs. I came to the      words '... in addition to her natural distinction she      possessed that August majesty which is the appanage of      princesses of the blood royal....'       \"Prince Henry laid down his pen and remarked, 'The author      who wrote this piece did not live much with queens.'       \"'Why?' I asked.       \"'Because I never observed the August majesty which attaches      to princesses of the blood royal, and yet I have been      brought up among them,' was the reply.       \"William, however,\" continues Monsieur Ayme, \"was the      thinker, prudent and circumspect; the wise head which knew      that it was not all truths which bear telling. He was not      less loyal and constant in his opinions. He admired the      French Revolution, and the declaration contained in 'The      Rights of Man,' though this did not prevent his declaiming      against the Terrorists.\"  One incident in particular must have appealed to the French tutor. Monsieur Ayme and his Prussian pupil one day began discussing the delicate question of the war of 1870. In the course of the discussion both parties lost their tempers, until at last Prince William suddenly got up and left the room. He remained silent and \"huffed\" for some days, but at last he took the Frenchman aside and made him a formal apology. \"I am very sorry indeed,\" he said,       \"that you took seriously my conduct of the other day. I      meant nothing by it, and I regret it hurt you. I am all the      more sorry, because I offended in your case a sentiment      which I respect above any in the world, the love of      country.\"  But it is time to pass from the details of the Emperor's early youth, and observe him during the two years he spent, with interruptions, at the university. From Cassel he went immediately to Bonn, where, as during the years of military duty which followed, we only catch glimpses of him as he lived the ordinary, and by no means austere, life of the university student and soldier of the time; that is to say, the ordinary life with considerable modifications and exceptions. He did not, like young Bismarck, drink huge flagons of beer at a sitting, day after day. He was not followed everywhere by a boar-hound. He fought no student's duels--though a secret performance of the kind is mentioned as a probability in the chronicles--or go about looking for trouble generally as the swashbuckling Junker, Bismarck, did; for in the first place his royal rank would not allow of his taking part in the bloody amusement of the _Mensur_, and his natural disposition, if it was quick and lively, was not choleric enough to involve him in serious quarrel. His studies were to some extent interrupted by military calls to Berlin, for after being appointed second lieutenant in the First Regiment of Foot Guards at Potsdam on his tenth birthday, the Hohenzollern age for entering the army, he was promoted to first lieutenant in the same regiment on leaving Cassel.  For the most part the university lectures he attended were the courses in law and philosophy, and he is not reported to have shown any particular enthusiasm for either subject. The differences between an English and a German university are of a fundamental kind, perhaps the greatest being that the German university does not aim at influencing conduct and character in the same measure as the English, but is rather for the supply of knowledge of all sorts, as a monster warehouse is for the supply of miscellaneous goods. Again, the German university, which, like all American universities except Princetown, has more resemblance to the Scottish universities than to those at Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, is not residential nor divided into colleges, but is departmentalized into \"faculties,\" each with its own professors and _privat docentes_, or official lecturers, mostly young savants, who have not the rank or title of professor, but have obtained only the _venia legendi_ from the university. The lectures, as a rule of admirable learning and thoroughness, invariably laying great and prosy stress on \"development,\" are delivered in large halls and may be subscribed for in as many faculties as the student chooses, the cost being about thirty shillings or there-abouts per term for each lecture \"heard.\" Outside the university the student enjoys complete independence, which is a privilege highly (and sometimes violently) cherished, especially by non-studious undergraduates, under the name \"academic freedom.\" The German preparing for one or other of the learned professions will probably spend a year or two at each of three, or maybe four, universities, according to the special faculty he adopts and for which the university has a reputation. There are plenty of hard-working students of course; nowadays probably the great majority are of this kind; but to a large proportion also the university period is still a pleasant, free, and easy halting-place between the severe discipline and work of the school and the stern struggle of the working world.  The social life of the English university is paralleled in Germany by associations of students in student \"Corps,\" with theatrical uniforms for their _Chargierte_ or officers, special caps, sometimes of extraordinary shape, swords, leather gauntlets, Wellington boots, and other distinguishing gaudy insignia. The Corps are more or less select, the most exclusive of all being the Corps Borussia, which at every university only admits members of an upper class of society, though on rare occasions receiving in its ranks an exceptionally aristocratic, popular, or wealthy foreigner. To this Corps, the name of which is the old form of \"Prussia,\" the Emperor belonged when at Bonn, and in one or two of his speeches he has since spoken of the agreeable memories he retains in connexion with it and the practices observed by it.  Common to all university associations in Germany--whether Corps, Landsmannschaft, Burschenschaft, or Turnerschaft--is the practice of the _Mensur_, or student duel. It is not a duel in the sense usually given to the word in England, for it lacks the feature of personal hostility, hate, or injury, but is a particularly sanguinary form of the English \"single-stick,\" in which swords take the place of sticks. These swords (_Schläger_), called, curiously enough, _rapiere_, are long and thin in the blade, and their weight is such that at every duel students are told off on whose shoulders the combatants can rest their outstretched sword-arm in the pauses of the combat caused by the duellists getting out of breath; consequently, an undersized student is usually chosen for this considerate office. The heads and faces of the duellists are swathed in bandages--no small incentive to perspiration, the vital parts of their bodies are well protected against a fatal prick or blow, and the pricks or slashes must be delivered with the hand and wrist raised head-high above the shoulder. It is considered disgraceful to move the head, to shrink in the smallest degree before the adversary, or even to show feeling when the medical student who acts as surgeon in an adjoining room staunches the flow of blood or sews up the scars caused by the swords. The duel of a more serious kind--that with pistols or the French rapier, or with the bare-pointed sabre and unprotected bodies--is punishable by law, and is growing rarer each year.  Take a sabre duel--\"heavy sabre duel\" is the German name for it--arising out of a quarrel in a cafe or beer-house, and in which one of the opponents may be a foreigner affiliated to some Corps or Burschenschaft. Cards are exchanged, and the challenger chooses a second whom he sends to the opponent. The latter, if he accepts the challenge, also appoints a second; the seconds then meet and arrange for the holding of a court of honour. The court will probably consist of old Corps students--lawyer, a doctor, and two or three other members of the Corps or Burschenschaft. The court summons the opponents before it and hears their account of the quarrel; the seconds produce evidence, for example the bills at the cafe or beer-hall, showing how much liquor has been consumed; also as to age, marriage or otherwise, and so on. Then the court decides whether there shall be a duel, or not, and if so, in what form it shall be fought.  The duel may be fixed to take place at any time within six months, and meanwhile the opponents industriously practise. The scene of the duel is usually the back room of some beer-hall, with locked doors between the duellists and the police. The latter know very well what is going on, but shut their eyes to it. The opponents take their places at about a yard and a half distance from advanced foot to advanced foot, and a chalk line is drawn between them. Close behind each opponent is his second with outstretched sword,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13043"],["title","William of Germany (#6)"],["body"," to knock up the duellists' weapons in case of too dangerous an impetuosity in the onset. The umpire _(Unparteiischer)_, unarmed, stands a little distance from the duellists. The latter are naked _to_ the waist, but wear a leather apron like that of a drayman, covering the lower half of the chest, and another piece of leather, like a stock, protecting their necks and jugular veins. The duel may last a couple of hours, and any number of rounds up to as many as two hundred may be fought. The rounds consist of three or four blows, and last about twenty seconds each, when the seconds, who have been watching behind their men in the attitude of a wicket-keeper, with their sword-points on the ground, jump in and knock up the duellists' weapons. When one duellist is disabled by skin wounds--there are rarely any others--or by want of breath, palpitation or the like, the duel is over, and the duellists shake hands. This description, with some slight modifications, applies to the ordinary Corps _Mensuren_, which are simply a bloody species of gymnastic exercise.  On one occasion early in the reign the Emperor spoke of the Corps system with great enthusiasm, and especially endorsed the practice of the _Mensur_. \"I am quite convinced,\" he said at Bonn in 1891, three years after his accession,       \"that every young man who enters a Corps receives through      the spirit which rules in it, and supposing he imbibes the      spirit, his true directive in life. For it is the best      education for later life a young man can obtain. Whoever      pokes fun at the German student Corps is ignorant of its      true tendency, and I hope that so long as student Corps      exist the spirit which is fostered in them, and which      inspires strength and courage, will continue, and that for      all time the student will joyfully wield the _Schläger_.\"  Regarding the _Mensur_, he went on:       \"Our _Mensuren_ are frequently misunderstood by the public,      but that must not let us be deceived. We who have been Corps      students, as I myself was, know better. As in the Middle      Ages through our gymnastic exercises (_Turniere_) the      courage and strength of the man was steeled, so by means of      the Corps spirit and Corps life is that measure of firmness      acquired which is necessary in later life, and which will      continue to exist as long as there are universities in      Germany.\"  The word for firmness used by the Emperor was _Festigkeit_, which may also be translated determination, steadiness, fortitude, or resoluteness of character. It may be that practice of the _Mensur_, which is held almost weekly, has a lifelong influence on the German student's character. It probably enables him to look the adversary in the eye--look \"hard\" at him, as the mariners in Mr. A.W. Jacobs's delightful tales look at one another when some particularly ingenious lie is being produced. In a way, moreover, it may be said to correspond to boxing in English universities, schools, and gymnasia. But, on the whole, the Anglo-Saxon spectator finds it difficult to understand how it can exercise any influence for good on the moral character of a youth, or determine, as the Emperor says it does, a disposition which is cowardly or weak by nature to bravery or strength, save of a momentary and merely physical kind. The Englishman who has been present at a _Mensur_ is rather inclined to think the atmosphere too much that of a shambles, and the chief result of the practice the cultivation of braggadocio.  Besides, the practice is illegal, and though purposely overlooked, save in one German city, that of Leipzig, where it is punished with some rigour, the Emperor, who is supposed to embody the majesty and effectiveness of the law, is hardly the person to recommend it. His inconsistency in the matter on one occasion placed him in an undignified position. Two officers of the army quarrelled, and one, an infantry lieutenant, sent a challenge to the other, an army medical man. The latter refused on conscientious grounds, whereupon he was called on by a military court of honour to send in his resignation. The case was sent up to the Emperor, who upheld the decision of the court of honour, adding the remark that if the surgeon had conscientious scruples on the point he should not remain in the army. An irate Social Democratic editor thereupon pointed out that such a decision came with a bad grace from a man with whom, or with any of whose six sons, no one was allowed to fight. The Emperor is still a member of the Borussia Corps, but chiefly shows his interest by keeping its anniversaries in mind, by every few years attending one of its annual drinking festivals (_Commers_), and by paying a substantial yearly subscription.  The German student Corps, historically, go back to the fourteenth century, when the first European universities were established at Bologna, Paris, and Orleans. Universities then were not so called from the universality of their teachings, but rather as meaning a corporation, confraternity, or collegium, and were in reality social centres in the towns where they were instituted. The most renowned was that of Paris, and here was founded the first student Corps. It was called the \"German Nation of Paris,\" a corporation of students, with statutes, oaths, special costumes, and other distinctive features. At first, strange to say, it contained more Englishmen than Germans. The \"Nation\" had a procurator, a treasurer, and a bedell, the last to look after the legal affairs of the association. Drinking was not the supposed purpose of the society, but the Corps mostly assembled, as German Corps do to-day, for drinking purposes.  The earliest form of German student associations Was the Landsmannschaft. To this society, composed of elders and juniors, new-comers, called Pennales, were admitted after painful ceremonies and became something like the \"fags\" at an English public school. The object of the original Landsmannschaft was to keep alive the spirit of nationality. The object of the German Corps is different. It is to beget and perpetuate friendship, and this accounts for the steady goodwill the Emperor has always shown towards the comrades of his Bonn and Borussia days.  An ancient form of Corps entertainment is called the Hospiz, now, however, much modified. Upon invitation the members of the Corps meet in a beer-hall or in the rooms of one of the Corps. The president is seated with a house-key on the table before him as a symbol of unfettered authority. As members arrive, the president takes away their sticks and swords and deposits them in a closet. The guests sit down and are handed filled pipes and a lighted _fidibus_, or pipe-lighter. Bread and butter and cheese, followed by coffee, are offered. After this, the real work of the evening begins--the drinking. A large can of beer stands on a stool beside the president. The latter calls for silence by rapping three times on the table with the house-key, and the Hospiz is declared open. Thenceforward only the president pours out the beer, unless he appoints a deputy during his absence. The president's great aim and honour is to make every one, including himself, intoxicated. He begins by rapping the table with his glass and saying \"Significat ein Glas.\" In response all drain their glasses. Then comes a \"health to all,\" and this is followed by a \"health to each.\" \"The Ladies\" follow, including toasts to the pretty girls of the town, and ladies known to be favourites of those present. Married ladies or women of bad reputation must not be toasted in the Hospiz.  A story is told of a toast the Emperor, in these his Lohengrin days, once proposed at a Borussia meeting. \"On the Kreuzberg\" (a hill near Bonn), he said,       \"I saw a picture, the ideal of a German woman. She united in      herself beauty of face and an imposing form, the roses in      her cheeks spoke of the modesty peculiar to our maids, and      her voice sounded harmoniously like the lute of the      Minnesingers on the Wartburg. She told me her name--may it      be blessed.\"  The toast found its way into the local papers and gave birth to a romantic legend connecting the future Emperor with a pretty and modest girl of the town, but no true basis for it has ever been discovered.  In toasting the Ladies in a Hospiz each of those present may name the lady of his choice, and if two name the same lady they have a drinking bout to determine which is entitled to claim her. The one who first admits that he can drink no more--usually signified by a hasty and zigzag retreat from the room--is declared the loser. If a guest comes late to the Hospiz he must drink fast so as to catch up with earlier arrivals, unless he has been drinking elsewhere, when he is let off with drinking a \"general health.\"  The close of the Emperor's student days was marked by an event which was to have a great influence on his life and happiness. It was in 1879 that he made the acquaintance of the young lady who was, a couple of years later, to become his wife, and subsequently Empress. When at Bonn Prince William had developed a liking for wild-game shooting, and accepted an invitation from Duke Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein to shoot pheasants at Primkenau Castle, the Duke's seat in Silesia. More than one romantic story is current about the first meeting of the lovers, but that most generally credited, as it was published at or near the time, represents the young sportsman as meeting the lady accidentally in the garden of the castle. He had arrived at night and gone shooting early next morning before being introduced to the family of his host, and on his return surprised the fair-haired and blue-eyed Princess Auguste Victoria as she lay dozing in a hammock in the garden. The student approached, the words \"little Rosebud\" on his lips, but hastily withdrew as the Princess, all blushes, awoke. The pair met shortly afterwards at breakfast, when the visitor learned"]]]
