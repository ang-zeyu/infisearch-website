Lee instructed his men. \"Then mow them down, and make every shot count!\"  Joking and humming to themselves, the men prepared for action. The first line poked their rifles through the barricade and lay down behind them. All was in readiness to repulse the attack.  Suddenly the first Germans appeared around the turn in the bridge, marching five abreast.  \"Fire!\" cried the captain, and the British rifles broke into flame.  Five Germans tumbled to the bridge.  A sudden idea struck Hal.  \"There's no use wasting five bullets on each German,\" he told his men. \"Let the five men on the left each pick out a man. The rest reserve your fire unless one of our men go down, then the one nearest him take his man, and so on!\"  The second five Germans were too close behind their comrades, who had just fallen, to arrest their steps in time to avoid the British fire.  Five shots rang out as they came into view, and again five Germans fell. So far not a shot had been fired by the Germans. But now five more came around the turn with a rush, followed by five more, and still another five.  The first five dropped in a heap, but from the second five came a burst of flame and the crack of rifles. Two men behind the barricade dropped, one of whom was Capt. Lee. But the Germans paid dearly for their rash attack.  In less time than it takes to tell it, ten more Germans had bitten the dust. Then they drew off.  \"Good work, men!\" cried Chester. \"We can hold them off indefinitely,\" he added to Hal.  \"Looks like it,\" was Hal's reply. \"But if they make a concerted rush we shall have our hands full. How is Capt. Lee?\"  \"Very bad,\" answered one of the men. \"I am afraid he's done for.\"  And now the Germans came on again. The first five met the same fate that had overtaken their comrades, but behind them came more, and still more.  As each German rounded the turn in the bridge his rifle cracked, and continued to crack until he fell. Men inside the barricade also were beginning to fall fast now, and the reserve lines were being drawn upon more rapidly each minute.  Hal and Chester, crouching down, directed the defense. In spite of the fearful havoc wrought by the British fire, the Germans came on. The bridge was piled high with dead and wounded, but the enemy did not hesitate.  Their officers urged them on without regard for life, and bravely went to death with them. Rifles cracked in a steady roar and men on both sides fell rapidly. But each Englishman, sheltered as he was behind the barricade, accounted for at least several of the enemy before he himself went to his death.  Now the defenders had dwindled to fifty, and still there was no cessation of the German assault. The heaped up bodies of dead now formed a barricade for the Germans, and they advanced and fell behind them, using their dead companions as shields. Ten or fifteen rows deep they stood behind their dead, and poured volley after volley into the defenders.  The British reserved their fire as much as possible, but whenever a German head showed above the barricade of bodies a rifle cracked and almost every time a German fell.  All afternoon the fighting continued, the Germans, because of the fierce fire of the remaining English and hampered by their own dead, being unable to rush the defenders.  There were less than twenty-five of the British unwounded. Hal and Chester had both been struck, Hal on the arm and Chester on the shoulder. But neither was badly hurt.  \"Hadn't we better retreat, sir?\" asked one soldier of Hal, when there was a let up in the firing.  \"What chance would we have?\" demanded Hal. \"The minute we broke and ran we would be shot down like dogs.\"  \"Then we might surrender.\"  \"Surrender! Never! We were ordered to hold the bridge and we will hold it as long as we can.\"  The man subsided, and Hal turned his face toward the foe again. There was a sudden silence. The Germans drew off.  \"Wonder what that means?\" demanded Hal of Chester. \"They certainly are not going to give up. I wonder what they are up to now?\"  \"I can't imagine,\" replied Chester. \"But they have something up their sleeves.\"  \"Well, we'll soon see,\" said Hal.  But he was mistaken; for just as the first German again appeared around the turn, to be struck down by a British bullet, there was a sudden deafening roar from the rear, and turning suddenly Hal and Chester and the few brave soldiers who were left raised a feeble cheer.  Coming forward at a rapid trot were several squadrons of British cavalry, and far behind could be seen columns upon columns of infantry, advancing swiftly.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Hal. \"Saved! Hurrah!\"  \"Hurrah!\" repeated Chester, and completely worn out, he tumbled over in a heap.     CHAPTER VII.  HAL MAKES AN ENEMY.   Hal bent over his friend and shook him gently.  \"Chester! Chester!\" he exclaimed anxiously. \"Are you wounded?\"  There was no reply from the unconscious boy, and Hal became greatly alarmed. He turned to the few troopers who remained.  \"Here, lend a hand some of you,\" he commanded. \"One of you fetch some water!\"  Two of the men bent over the unconscious lad and one raised his head gently to his knee. A third dashed for the river, and a moment later returned with his cap filled with water.  Hal sprinkled a few drops of water on his friend's face, and soon noticed signs of returning consciousness. Finally Chester opened his eyes and smiled feebly.  \"Are you much hurt, old fellow?\" asked Hal anxiously.  \"No,\" came the feeble response. \"I don't think so. A bullet just grazed my side. I don't know how I came to topple over like that.\"  Quickly Hal unloosened his friend's coat, tore open his shirt and examined his wound.  \"It's only a scratch,\" he said, straightening up at last. \"Here,\" pulling out his handkerchief, \"I'll fix it up until we can have a surgeon look at it. You will be able to walk in a few minutes.\"  \"I'm able right now,\" said Chester, struggling to his feet.  Leaning heavily on Hal's arm, Chester turned his eyes toward the river bank, which now was lined with British troops, who were firing steadily at forms disappearing on the opposite side of the stream. The approach of the English in force had caused the Germans to beat a rapid retreat. From the opposite shore, however, still came puffs of smoke, and bullets continued to fall among the English troops, and here and there men fell to the ground.  \"They arrived just in time, didn't they, Hal?\" said Chester.  \"You bet they did,\" was the reply. \"But come, we will try to make our way back to our station.\"  With Chester still leaning on his shoulder, Hal led the way, going very slowly because of his burden. Making his friend comfortable under an army wagon, Hal went at once to Gen. French to make his report.  \"You have done well,\" was the general's only comment when Hal had concluded his recital.  Hal saluted and left.  \"Guess I'll go back and keep Chester company,\" he said to himself.  He was walking slowly along with bowed head, musing, when he came suddenly into contact with another figure. The man with whom he had collided mumbled an imprecation and violently pushed the lad away, at the same time exclaiming:  \"What do you mean by bumping into me like that? Can't you see where you are going? I have a notion to teach you better manners.\"  Hal's face flushed, and he turned a steady gaze on the other, who proved to be a French lieutenant.  \"I wouldn't try it if I were you,\" the lad advised him.  \"What!\" exclaimed the Frenchman. \"You dare to talk to me like that?\"  \"Of course I dare,\" was the lad's heated response.  The Frenchman took a quick step forward and slapped Hal smartly across the face.  Hal promptly sent his right fist crashing into the other's face and knocked him down.  The Frenchman rose slowly to his feet, and with blood streaming from his nose, approached Hal.  \"I am Lieutenant Dupree,\" he said. \"My friend shall call on you this evening.\"  \"I am Hal Paine, attached to the staff of General French,\" Hal said calmly, \"and your friend may call any time he so desires.\"  The Frenchman bowed stiffly, and continued on his way. Hal returned to Chester.  \"Back so soon?\" said Chester.  \"Yes,\" was Hal's reply; \"and back with more trouble.\"  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Chester in some consternation.  \"Well, I am afraid I have a duel on my hands.\"  \"A duel?\"  \"Yes; on my way here I accidentally bumped into some fiery French lieutenant. He slapped me across the face and I knocked him down. He then informed me his friend would call on me this evening. That sounds like a duel to me.\"  \"Yes,\" said Chester, \"unless it can be patched up.\"  \"I am afraid it can't. You know these Frenchmen. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to fight about, but I am afraid the Frenchman feels he has a grievance. He'll probably demand a fight or an apology.\"  \"Well?\"  \"I have nothing to apologize for; therefore I am afraid it means a duel.\"  \"Not if I can prevent it,\" exclaimed Chester, jumping to his feet.  \"But you can't,\" replied Hal grimly. \"And you had better lie down again. You are liable to strain your wound.\"  \"Oh, I am not worrying about the wound,\" exclaimed Chester. \"The doctor said there was no danger. It's you I am worrying about. Why, you are likely to be killed.\"  \"Oh, I guess I can give a good account of myself,\" returned Hal. \"I've been pretty fortunate thus far. I don't figure I am going to fall before any Frenchman's sword or pistol. I'll probably be saved for a German bullet some of these days.\"  Chester became silent. He knew that an argument was useless. Besides, he knew that in Hal's position his own actions would be the same.  It was shortly after 6 o'clock that evening when two French officers made their way to the quarters to which the boys had been assigned.  \"Choose swords,\" said Hal laconically, as Chester rose to greet the callers.  \"Mr. Paine,\" queried one of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12870"],["title","The Boy Allies on the Firing Line; Or, Twelve Days Battle Along the Marne (#5)"],["body","Frenchmen politely.  \"No,\" replied Chester; \"but I shall act for him.\"  \"Good,\" returned the Frenchman. \"I am Lieutenant Mercer, and this,\" indicating his companion, \"is Lieutenant Lamont.\"  \"I am Chester Crawford,\" said the lad briefly.  \"Then, to get down to business,\" said Lieutenant Mercer. \"Mr. Paine has insulted my friend, Lieutenant Dupree. My friend demands an apology.\"  \"There'll be no apology,\" said Chester shortly.  \"Ah! In that case my friend, Lieutenant Dupree, demands satisfaction from Mr. Paine.\"  \"It seems to me he has had satisfaction,\" said Chester.  \"Ah!\" replied the Frenchman cheerfully. \"You no doubt refer to the blow passed by Mr. Paine? It is for that my friend demands satisfaction.\"  \"He had that coming to him,\" declared Chester.  \"So you may believe. Lieutenant Dupree thinks otherwise. Now, as to the arrangements----\"  \"Look here,\" said Chester, interrupting. \"With the whole German army lined up in front of us, it seems to me that our friend should be able to find all the fighting he wants. This fighting among ourselves is all nonsense.\"  \"But my friend's honor----\" began the Frenchman.  \"Bosh!\" declared Chester. \"It wasn't your friend's honor that was hurt. It was his face.\"  \"Then am I to understand that your friend refuses to fight?\"  \"No!\" shouted Chester. \"He doesn't refuse to fight. He just doesn't see the necessity of fighting. That's all. But if you insist, he will give your friend all the satisfaction he wants.\"  \"I must insist,\" replied Lieutenant Mercer.  \"All right, then,\" said Chester. \"I am not familiar with dueling etiquette, but as the challenged party I believe the choice of weapons lies with us.\"  The Frenchman bowed in assent.  \"Then let it be swords!\"  \"Good! And the time and place?\"  \"I'll leave that to you.\"  \"In the morning at half-past five--provided we are all alive--in the little woods half a mile in the rear. Are these convenient for you?\"  \"Perfectly. We shall be there on time. Will you please bring weapons?\"  \"I shall be delighted,\" replied the Frenchman. \"Until the morning, then,\" and the two French officers bowed themselves out.  \"Well, you are into it now,\" said Chester to Hal, after their visitors had gone. \"Looks to me as though you had a fair chance of seeing the Happy Hunting Grounds before six o'clock to-morrow.\"  Before Hal could reply another visitor poked his head through the door of the tent.  \"Am I intruding?\" he asked.  \"Lieutenant Anderson!\" exclaimed Chester. \"Just the man I wanted to see.\"  \"What's the matter now?\" demanded the lieutenant.  \"Matter is that Hal's mixed up in a duel, to be pulled off in the morning.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Lieutenant Anderson in surprise.  \"Fact,\" said Hal. \"I bumped into some little whipper-snapper of a French lieutenant a couple of hours ago. He slapped me and I knocked him down. Now he demands satisfaction, and I am going to give it to him in the morning, at half-past five.\"  The lieutenant sat down heavily.  \"Well, you are the limit,\" he said. \"You are always in a scrape of some kind. I suppose it's up to me to prevent the duel.\"  \"No chance,\" said Hal briefly.  \"No,\" agreed Chester, \"and it's up to you to make the third party on our side. I suppose the other crowd will bring a surgeon.\"  \"Do you know what will happen if you are found out?\" demanded the lieutenant.  \"No,\" said Hal.  \"Well, it probably will mean strict confinement, at least. The regulations in regard to dueling are very stringent.\"  \"I can't help that,\" said Hal. \"I can't back out now.\"  \"Well, if that's the way you feel about it,\" replied the lieutenant, \"I'll help you as best I can. I'll stay here to-night and go along to see that you get fair play.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE DUEL.   It was hardly light when Chester, who had been unable to close his eyes, aroused Lieutenant Anderson. The two finished dressing before rousing Hal, thinking to give him all the rest possible before waking him up. Finally Chester shook him by the shoulder.  \"What's the matter,\" muttered Hal drowsily. \"Time to get up already? I just went to sleep. What's up? Oh, yes, I remember now. I'm to fight a duel this morning. All right, I'll be ready in a jiffy.\"  \"How did you sleep?\" demanded Chester, as Hal was dressing.  \"Fine. Never slept better in my life.\"  Lieutenant Anderson approached and laid his finger on Hal's pulse.  \"You'll do,\" he said quietly.  \"I haven't any nerves, if that is what you mean,\" said Hal with a smile.  Lieutenant Anderson smiled back at him.  \"I believe it,\" he replied. \"But come, we had better be on our way.\"  Quietly the three left the tent. There was a penetrating chill in the early morning air. It was light now, but the sun had not yet appeared above the horizon. Dense clouds obscured the sky.  \"Not a very cheerful morning to die,\" commented Hal lightly, as they made their way quietly along.  \"You are not afraid, are you?\" asked Chester anxiously.  \"What, after yesterday? Not a little bit.\"  \"I don't believe you know what fear is,\" declared Lieutenant Anderson.  Lieutenant Dupree, his two friends and a surgeon were already on the ground when Hal, Chester and Lieutenant Anderson arrived. All raised their caps as they came together. The seconds drew apart to discuss the details of the duel, Hal and Lieutenant Dupree in the meantime discarding their coats and rolling up their sleeves.  The details completed, Hal and the French lieutenant were at last face to face.  \"On guard!\" came the command, given by Lieutenant Anderson.  The swords flashed aloft.  A moment later and they were at it. For a few moments both combatants were wary, each feeling the other out. A few passes and Hal realized that he was no match for the more experienced Frenchman.  \"I must be very careful,\" he told himself. \"Perhaps I can wear him down a bit, and slip over a light thrust. I certainly don't want to kill him. And I don't want to be killed myself.\"  The French lieutenant was pressing him sorely now. His sword darted in and out with dazzling rapidity, and Hal thanked his stars that he had been fortunate enough to have had some schooling in the use of the foil.  Hal contented himself with remaining on the defensive, and not an attempt did he make to touch the Frenchman, although the latter left several openings, only, Hal knew, to draw him on. The lieutenant at last began to grow impatient, and with impatience came carelessness.  He had realized, as had Hal, with the first few passes, that the lad was not an accomplished swordsman. And the fact now that he could not penetrate the other's guard angered him.  Suddenly he aimed a fierce thrust at Hal, and the latter only escaped being impaled on the other's sword by a quick leap aside. Before the Frenchman could recover his balance, Hal stepped nimbly forward again, his sword darted out, and the lieutenant dropped his weapon with a muttered imprecation. Hal's point had pierced his arm just below the shoulder.  The Frenchman's seconds immediately leaped forward, and Hal stepped over to Chester and Lieutenant Anderson.  \"I guess that ends it,\" he said. \"I suppose his honor is appeased now.\"  \"Don't be too sure,\" replied Lieutenant Anderson. \"He is likely to be more furious than ever, and demand that the fight continue until one of you fall. He must realize that you are no match for him, and he counts on that to give him victory. However, I must say that you have handled yourself well, and, if you keep your head, you may succeed in dropping him.\"  The lieutenant's predictions proved correct. Lieutenant Dupree had had his wound bandaged, and now demanded that the fight be resumed. Hal was not the lad to protest, so the two were soon at swords' points again.  But now both Hal and Lieutenant Dupree fought more warily. Hal could read in his opponent's eyes that he had made up his mind to kill him. Touched once because of his carelessness, Hal knew that the Frenchman would be more wary.  In stepping back before a fierce thrust of his opponent's sword, Hal's foot slipped. He threw up his arm, and for a moment was off his guard. Before he could recover his balance, the Frenchman's sword flashed up under his guard and pierced him through the left shoulder.  The lad staggered back, and the Frenchman, unheeding the accident and the calls of Lieutenant Anderson and Chester, pressed his advantage. With a grim smile he started a thrust that would have ended Hal's days; but, with a sudden lurch, Hal staggered forward, threw up his sword, and, with a terrific stroke, swept the sword from the Frenchman's hand. Lieutenant Dupree was at his mercy.  The Frenchman stepped back and folded his arms, as Hal took a step forward.  \"Kill me,\" he said quietly.  \"Run him through!\" shouted Lieutenant Anderson. \"He tried to kill you unfairly.\"  Slowly Hal lowered his sword.  \"No,\" he said, \"I can't do it. Neither will I continue the fight.\" He turned to his late opponent. \"I hope your honor is satisfied,\" he said.  The Frenchman turned, and, with bowed head, replaced his coat; then with his two friends he walked away.  The surgeon hurried to Hal's side and peered at his wound.  \"Not serious,\" he said, after an examination. \"I'll have it fixed all right in a moment.\"  The wound dressed, the surgeon offered Hal his hand.  \"You are a gallant youngster,\" he said, \"and I am proud to know you. Many a man in your place would have killed his opponent. Your coolness is a thing to be admired.\"  Hal shook hands with the surgeon, and the latter then took himself off.  Lieutenant Anderson approached Hal and grasped him by both arms.  \"You are all right,\" he said, emphasizing each word. \"I was afraid it was all up with you.\"  \"And so was I,\" said Chester. \"But, if you had fallen unfairly, I would have killed him myself.\"  The three made their way back to the boys' quarters, where they sat down and talked the duel over.  \"The best thing you can do now,\" said Lieutenant Anderson to Hal finally, \"is to get a little rest. Both of you are wounded, and will not have to"]]]
