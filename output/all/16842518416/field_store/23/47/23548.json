Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform, on our troops went to the second line of works; over that and on for the crest--thus effectually carrying out my orders of the 18th for the battle and of the 24th (*17) for this charge.  I watched their progress with intense interest.  The fire along the rebel line was terrific.  Cannon and musket balls filled the air:  but the damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended.  The pursuit continued until the crest was reached, and soon our men were seen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in front of both Sheridan's and Wood's divisions.  The retreat of the enemy along most of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg and his officers lost all control over their men.  Many were captured, and thousands threw away their arms in their flight.  Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at a point above where the enemy crossed.  He met some resistance from troops occupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge, probably to cover the retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains.  It was now getting dark, but Sheridan, without halting on that account pushed his men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting the attention of the men placed to defend it, while he detached to the right and left to surround the position.  The enemy discovered the movement before these dispositions were complete, and beat a hasty retreat, leaving artillery, wagon trains, and many prisoners in our hands.  To Sheridan's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland, and the nation, are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, and small-arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this way would not have been accomplished.  While the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward, General Thomas with staff, General Gordon Granger, commander of the corps making the assault, and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob, from which the entire field could be observed.  The moment the troops were seen going over the last line of rebel defences, I ordered Granger to join his command, and mounting my horse I rode to the front.  General Thomas left about the same time. Sheridan on the extreme right was already in pursuit of the enemy east of the ridge.  Wood, who commanded the division to the left of Sheridan, accompanied his men on horseback in the charge, but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit.  To the left, in Baird's front where Bragg's troops had massed against Sherman, the resistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer.  I ordered Granger to follow the enemy with Wood's division, but he was so much excited, and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemy had taken, that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had got well out of the way.  The enemy confronting Sherman, now seeing everything to their left giving way, fled also.  Sherman, however, was not aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall, when he received orders to pursue at daylight in the morning.  As soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front he directed his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland, to push over the pontoon-bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, and to move forward to Chickamauga Station.  He ordered Howard to move up the stream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it during the night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning.  Morgan L. Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was still held.  Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies. The rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylight in the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.  Hooker, as stated, was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destruction of the bridge at that point.  He got his troops over, with the exception of the artillery, by fording the stream at a little after three o'clock. Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed, he pushed on with the remainder of his command.  At Rossville he came upon the flank of a division of the enemy, which soon commenced a retreat along the ridge.  This threw them on Palmer.  They could make but little resistance in the position they were caught in, and as many of them as could do so escaped.  Many, however, were captured.  Hooker's position during the night of the 25th was near Rossville, extending east of the ridge.  Palmer was on his left, on the road to Graysville.  During the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated, and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could hold out; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory, and informed him that forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside.  Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for the relief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear. Thomas was directed to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanooga loaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition.  Granger's corps was to move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of the Holston, and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat.  In addition to the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, and four days' rations in haversacks.  In the battle of Chattanooga, troops from the Army of the Potomac, from the Army of the Tennessee, and from the Army of the Cumberland participated.  In fact, the accidents growing out of the heavy rains and the sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that the organizations were not kept together, under their respective commanders, during the battle.  Hooker, on the right, had Geary's division of the 12th corps, Army of the Potomac; Osterhaus's division of the 15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; and Cruft's division of the Army of the Cumberland.  Sherman had three divisions of his own army, Howard's corps from the Army of the Potomac, and Jefferson C. Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland.  There was no jealousy--hardly rivalry.  Indeed, I doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact of this intermingling of commands.  All saw a defiant foe surrounding them, and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him, and it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end was accomplished.  The victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds, considering the advantage the enemy had of position, and was accomplished more easily than was expected by reason of Bragg's making several grave mistakes: first, in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twenty thousand troops; second, in sending away a division of troops on the eve of battle; third, in placing so much of a force on the plain in front of his impregnable position.  It was known that Mr. Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on Missionary Ridge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga. It was reported and believed that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference between Bragg and Longstreet, and finding this difficult to do, planned the campaign against Knoxville, to be conducted by the latter general.  I had known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war, the latter very well.  We had been three years at West Point together, and, after my graduation, for a time in the same regiment.  Then we served together in the Mexican War.  I had known Bragg in Mexico, and met him occasionally subsequently.  I could well understand how there might be an irreconcilable difference between them.  Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man, professionally and otherwise.  He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed of an irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious.  A man of the highest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old army he was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was always on the lookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; as a post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest neglect, even of the most trivial order.  I have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg. On one occasion, when stationed at a post of several companies commanded by a field officer, he was himself commanding one of the companies and at the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary.  He was first lieutenant at the time, but his captain was detached on other duty.  As commander of the company he made a requisition upon the quartermaster--himself--for something he wanted.  As quartermaster he declined to fill the requisition, and endorsed on the back of it his reasons for so doing.  As company commander he responded to this, urging that his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to, and that it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it.  As quartermaster he still persisted that he was right.  In this condition of affairs Bragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post. The latter, when he saw the nature of the matter referred, exclaimed: \"My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!\"  Longstreet was an entirely different man.  He was brave, honest, intelligent, a very capable soldier, subordinate to his superiors, just and kind to his subordinates, but jealous of his own rights, which he had the courage to maintain.  He was never on the lookout to detect a slight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.  It may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reason stated, but because Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military genius, and thought he saw a chance of \"killing two birds with one stone.\"  On several occasions during the war he came to the relief "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5864"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U.

BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA--HANCOCK'S POSITION--ASSAULT OF WARREN'S AND WRIGHT'S CORPS--UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD--GOOD NEWS FROM BUTLER AND SHERIDAN.  The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the Ta, the Po and the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of the four.  It takes its rise about a mile south and a little east of the Wilderness Tavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place, but farther away. Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these two streams, and where they are but a few miles apart.  The Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania without crossing either of these streams. Lee's army coming up by the Catharpin Road, had to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came by the Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace. Burnside coming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the Ny near the enemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they were soon driven off by a brigade of Willcox's division, and the stream was crossed.  This brigade was furiously attacked; but the remainder of the division coming up, they were enabled to hold their position, and soon fortified it.  About the time I received the news of this attack, word came from Hancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced over to the Catharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and again at Wooden Bridge. These are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupy on the 8th, while one division should occupy Spottsylvania.  These movements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make the attempt to get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  I made arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmond if he should try to execute this design.  If he had any such intention it was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny.  The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with abrupt banks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy bottoms--at the time we were there--and difficult to cross except where bridged.  The country about was generally heavily timbered, but with occasional clearings.  It was a much better country to conduct a defensive campaign in than an offensive one.  By noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as follows:  Lee occupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and north-east, inclosing the town.  Anderson was on his left extending to the Po, Ewell came next, then Early.  Warren occupied our right, covering the Brock and other roads converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left and Burnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's Tavern, but as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock's front the latter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He formed a line with three divisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon, and was ordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy's flank.  The fourth division of Hancock's corps, Mott commanding, was left at Todd's when the corps first came up; but in the afternoon it was brought up and placed to the left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps.  In the morning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his intrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one to the Army of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G. Wright succeeded him in the command of his corps.  Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left flank of Lee's army, but separated from it, and also from the remainder of Meade's army, by the Po River.  But for the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night he would have attempted to cross the river again at Wooden Bridge, thus bringing himself on the same side with both friend and foe.  The Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly due east. Just below his lower crossing--the troops crossed at three points--it turns due south, and after passing under Wooden Bridge soon resumes a more easterly direction.  During the night this corps built three bridges over the Po; but these were in rear.  The position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce his left during the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the 10th, when Hancock renewed his effort to get over the Po to his front, he found himself confronted by some of Early's command, which had been brought from the extreme right of the enemy during the night.  He succeeded in effecting a crossing with one brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenched in his front, no more were crossed.  Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with the view of forcing a crossing, if it was found that an advantage could be gained.  The enemy was found strongly intrenched on the high ground overlooking the river, and commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery. Anderson's left rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, for Hancock to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side of the stream with the rest of the army--would still farther isolate him from it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of the enemy to unite with the main body.  The idea of crossing was therefore abandoned.  Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement of Hancock's, and I determined to take advantage of it.  Accordingly in the morning, orders were issued for an attack in the afternoon on the centre by Warren's and Wright's corps, Hancock to command all the attacking force.  Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po. Gibbon was placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as a reserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and Mott of the same corps was still to the left of Wright's corps.  Burnside was ordered to reconnoitre his front in force, and, if an opportunity presented, to attack with vigor.  The enemy seeing Barlow's division isolated from the rest of the army, came out and attacked with fury. Barlow repulsed the assault with great slaughter, and with considerable loss to himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault. Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river crossings built by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The second assault was repulsed, again with severe loss to the enemy, and Barlow was withdrawn without further molestation. General T. G. Stevenson was killed in this move.  Between the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place, there was a ravine grown up with large trees and underbrush, making it almost impenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides were also covered with a heavy growth of timber.  Warren, before noon, reconnoitred his front twice, the first time with one and the second with two divisions.  He was repulsed on both occasions, but gained such information of the ground as to induce him to report recommending the assault.  Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably advanced position from the one he started from.  He then organized a storming party, consisting of twelve regiments, and assigned Colonel Emory Upton, of the 121st New York Volunteers, to the command of it.  About four o'clock in the afternoon the assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright's corps, with Mott's division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously. The movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of struggles began.  The battle-field was so densely covered with forest that but little could be seen, by any one person, as to the progress made.  Meade and I occupied the best position we could get, in rear of Warren.  Warren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being among the killed.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy, and was thereby enabled to reorganize his command as soon as covered from the guns of the enemy.  To the left our success was decided, but the advantage was lost by the feeble action of Mott.  Upton with his assaulting party pushed forward and crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to the right and left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners. Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much time was lost in trying to get up the troops which were in the right position to reinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw; but the officers and men of his command were so averse to giving up the advantage they had gained that I withdrew the order.  To relieve them, I ordered a renewal of the assault.  By this time Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division to relieve Barlow, had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corps was now joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It was gallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of the enemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they were withdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the guns he had captured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had gained an important advantage, but a lack in others of the spirit and dash possessed by him lost it to us.  Before leaving Washington I had been authorized to promote officers on the field for special acts of gallantry.  By this authority I conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on the spot, and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been badly wounded in this fight.  Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards of Spottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He was not aware of the importance of the advantage he had gained, and I, being with the troops where the heavy fighting was, did not know of it at the time.  He had gained his position with but little fighting, and almost without loss.  Burnside's position now separated him widely from Wright's corps, the corps nearest to him.  At night he was ordered to join on to this.  This brought him back about a mile, and lost to us an important advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I do to myself for not having had a staff"]]]
