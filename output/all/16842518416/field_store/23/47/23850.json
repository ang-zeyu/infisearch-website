You here, too?\" exclaimed Chester.  \"Yes; and Hal is driving this car.  You keep quiet now.  We're in grave danger and you must get all the rest you can.  We may have need of your services before long.\"  Chester's head dropped back and his eyes closed.  He sat up abruptly again a moment later, however, and demanded sharply:  \"Where's the list?\"  \"Safe,\" replied Stubbs quietly.  Chester sank back again with an exclamation of satisfaction.      CHAPTER XI  MCKENZIE IN ACTION  It was broad daylight now and Hat felt the necessity of traveling at a slower speed than he had through the darkness of the night. Accordingly he reduced the speed of the big car to not more than thirty-five miles an hour.  Stubbs leaned forward and called to Hal.  \"How far do you suppose we are from the Dutch border?\"  \"Don't know,\" was the reply, \"but it's a long ways.  We're not more than 70 miles from Berlin.\"  Several times during the next few hours they were halted, but were permitted to pass on, after showing their passports.  Apparently the Berlin authorities had not wired ahead, and Hal was unable to account for this satisfactorily.  \"Something peculiar about it,\" he muttered, as he bent over the wheel.  For the next few hours the automobile proceeded on its way without interruption, save for a single stop to replenish gasoline and air.  It was well along toward evening when Stubbs announced that the Dutch frontier was only a few miles distant.  Once over the line they would be comparatively safe.  A foreboding of trouble swept over Hal.  Chester had slept during most of the trip thus far.  McKenzie had examined the lad carefully and discovered that he was suffering from a flesh wound in the left side.  The Canadian had bound this up as well as he could as the automobile jostled along.  His experienced eye told him there was nothing dangerous about the wound.  It was painful, of course, and Chester would naturally be stiff in body for some time; but, providing the wound was kept clean, there was no danger of infection.  Now, at Hal's injunction, Stubbs aroused Chester.  The lad opened his eyes slowly.  \"How do you feel, old man?\" asked McKenzie.  Chester sat up and passed a hand across his forehead.  \"I don't feel any too playful,\" he said with a wry smile.  \"Where are we, anyhow?\"  \"Getting pretty close to the Dutch border,\" returned McKenzie.  \"What'd you want to wake me for?\" Chester demanded of Stubbs.  \"Believe me,\" said Stubbs, \"I didn't want to wake you up.  It's usually safer for all concerned when you and Hal are both asleep.  I woke you up because Hal told me to.\"  \"That's all right, then,\" said Chester.  \"But don't you try to rub it into me, Stubbs, just because I've got a bullet hole in me is no sign I'm a cripple, you know.\"  \"Maybe not,\" said Stubbs. \"Here, take this gun.\"  He passed a revolver to Chester.  \"What's the idea?\" demanded Chester, taking the revolver; \"going to fight me a duel or something?\"  \"Don't be a fool,\" said Stubbs.  \"We're still in Germany, remember. You may need that gun before we get out.\"  \"All right, Stubbs,\" returned Chester.  \"Thanks.\"  Ahead, Hal suddenly made out a large body of men in such position as to block the road.  He slowed down the car, and, leaning back, addressed the others.  \"If I'm not mistaken,\" he said quietly, pointing, \"just beyond lies the Dutch border.  Once across we are comparatively safe.  At least the Germans will not dare to follow us on to neutral ground.  At the same time, if we are apprehended by Dutch military authorities our mission will be a failure, because we shall be interned.  What is your advice?\"  \"Get into Holland first and let matters take their course later,\" said Chester quietly.  \"I agree with you,\" said McKenzie.  \"And I,\" said Hal.  \"Well,\" said Stubbs, \"I don't.  Not that it will make any difference, of course, because you will do as you wish anyhow.\"  \"If you have any better plan, Stubbs,\" said Chester, \"let's hear it.\"  \"I don't have any plan,\" declared Stubbs, \"but seems to me you could think of a better one.  To rush through those fellows ahead means a fight, a that's why you decided on that plan.  I'm against a fight at all hazards.\"  \"So I perceive,\" said McKenzie dryly.  \"Well; you stick along anyhow, Stubbs,\" said Chester.  \"Oh, I'll stick,\" said Stubbs, \"but I'm going to tell you right now I don't think I'm going to do you any good.\"  \"Well, if we are decided,\" said Hal, \"we might as well go on.  We'll show our passports again and it may be we'll get through without question.  However, something tells me we are going to have trouble, so get your guns ready.\"  \"If you think we're going to have trouble, I'm absolutely positive of it,\" Stubbs mumbled to himself.  However, each looked to his weapons and made sure that they were in working order.  \"One of us has got to get through,\" said Chester in a low voice.  \"Who has the list, Stubbs?\"  \"Hal,\" was the response.  \"Then Hal must get through no matter what happens to the rest of us,\" said Chester quietly.  \"Good lord!\" said Stubbs.  \"Why didn't I keep that list!\"  As the large automobile approached, several of the Germans ahead stepped directly into the road and one threw up a hand in a signal demanding a halt.  Hal made out that at this point there were perhaps a dozen men, though to each side he saw countless other forms.  These latter, however, appeared no wise interested in the automobile and its occupants, but went about their several duties.  Hal put on the brakes and the automobile came to a stop a few feet from the nearest German, who, it appeared, was a colonel of infantry.  The German, followed by his men, approached the car and surrounded it.  \"Who are you?\" he demanded.  \"Dutch war correspondents,\" replied Hal quietly.  \"Your passports,\" demanded the German.  The four friends produced their passports and extended them to the officer.  The latter scanned them hastily, then cried:  \"As I thought.  You are the men we want.  Seize them!\"  This last command to his soldiers.  Instantly the dozen soldiers swooped toward the automobile, their rifles leveled.  At the same moment Hal sent the large automobile forward with a jump.  The German rifles spat fire.  Revolvers appeared simultaneously in the hands of Chester and McKenzie.  Both sprang to their feet, and, each holding to a side of the machine, they returned the fire, as Hal bent over the wheel.  \"Crack!  Crack!\"  Chester and McKenzie fired together.  In spite of the movement of the car their aim was true, and two German soldiers fell in their tracks. Stubbs still kept his seat.  The automobile, with its first lurch forward, had mowed down several of the enemy, and now dashed forward with a clear path to the Dutch border.  Behind, at command from the German officer, the troopers, still upon their feet, fell to their knees, and, taking deliberate aim at the rapidly moving car, fired.  There was an explosion from the automobile.  The car jumped crazily. Chester, still standing, revolver in hand, was flung violently into his seat, but McKenzie was not so fortunate.  He toppled from the car head foremost.  One of the German bullets had punctured a rear tire.  Hal brought the machine to a stop.  \"Out and run for it!\" cried Hal, and suited the action to the word.  Chester clambered out with more difficulty, for the wound in his side still pained him.  McKenzie, strange as it may seem, had not been badly hurt by his fall.  He got to his feet, still clutching his revolver. As the Germans hurried toward him, he raised the automatic and opened fire.  The first German pitched headlong to earth, as did the second.  McKenzie gave ground slowly.  With a swift look he saw that Hal had almost reached the Dutch border, which he perceived was guarded by a squad of Dutch soldiers.  Chester also was limping in that direction.  Stubbs, in spite of his opposition to fighting, was lending the lad a helping hand.  \"They'll make it, if I can hold these fellows a minute,\" muttered McKenzie.  He faced the foe again, and from a pocket brought forth a second automatic.  \"Not for nothing was I called the best shot in the northwest,\" he said quietly.  Hal's idea in not waiting to assist in the flight of the others, McKenzie knew on the instant.  The list they had risked so much to get must be taken from German territory at all hazards.  McKenzie knew, too, that Chester and Stubbs were simply following instructions when they also fled.  It was every man for himself.  A German bullet whistled close to the Canadian.  \"Well,\" he said quietly, \"I'll get a few of you before you drop me.\"  He faced his foes unflinchingly.      CHAPTER XII  SAFE AT LAST  McKenzie's arms went up again--not shoulder high--just to his hips.  For McKenzie, in his early days, had been reckoned in the Canadian northwest as the most deadly shot in the country.  He fired from his hips and aimed by instinct and not by sight.  Each automatic flashed once and two more of the foe fell to the ground.  McKenzie staggered a bit as a German bullet plowed into his shoulder.  Then his revolvers spoke again.  As he fought, the Canadian gave ground slowly.  He seemed to bear a charmed life.  Two other bullets struck him--one in the arm and the other in the thigh, but no one reached a vital spot.  Hal, Chester and Stubbs, in the meantime, had reached and crossed the Dutch border.  There they were immediately taken in charge by order of' the Dutch officer in command.  Hal addressed the officer quickly.  \"Can't you do something for my friend?\" he demanded, pointing to where McKenzie was still battling against heavy odds.  The Dutch, officer shook his head.  \"I would if I could,\" he said, his face flushed.  \"He is a brave "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6086"],["title","The Scottish Chiefs (#0)"],["body","Scottish Chiefs by Miss Jane Porter     Chapter I.  Scotland.   Bright was the summer of 1296.  The war which had desolated Scotland was then at an end.  Ambition seemed satiated; and the vanquished, after having passed under the yoke of their enemy, concluded they might wear their chains in peace.  Such were the hopes of those Scottish noblemen who, early in the preceding spring, had signed the bond of submission to a ruthless conqueror, purchasing life at the price of all that makes life estimable-liberty and honor.  Prior to this act of vassalage, Edward I., King of England, had entered Scotland at the head of an immense army.  He seized Berwick by stratagem; laid the country in ashes; and, on the field of Dunbar, forced the Scottish king and his nobles to acknowledge him their liege lord.  But while the courts of Edward, or of his representatives, were crowded by the humbled Scots, the spirit of one brave man remained unsubdued. Disgusted alike at the facility with which the sovereign of a warlike nation could resign his people and his crown into the hands of a treacherous invader, and at the pusillanimity of the nobles who had ratified the sacrifice, William Wallace retired to the glen of Ellerslie.  Withdrawn from the world, he hoped to avoid the sight of oppressions he could not redress, and the endurance of injuries beyond his power to avenge.  Thus checked at the opening of life in the career of glory that was his passion-secluded in the bloom of manhood from the social haunts of men--he repressed the eager aspirations of his mind, and strove to acquire that resignation to inevitable evils which alone could reconcile him to forego the promises of his youth, and enable him to view with patience a humiliation of Scotland, which blighted her honor, menaced her existence, and consigned her sons to degradation or obscurity.  The latter was the choice of Wallace.  Too noble to bend his spirit to the usurper, too honest to affect submission, he resigned himself to the only way left of maintaining the independence of a true Scot; and giving up the world at once, all the ambitions of youth became extinguished in his breast, since nothing was preserved in his country to sanctify their fires.  Scotland seemed proud of her chains. Not to share in such debasement, appeared all that was now in his power; and within the shades of Ellerslie he found a retreat and a home, whose sweets beguiling him of every care, made him sometimes forget the wrongs of his country in the tranquil enjoyments of wedded love.  During the happy mouths of the preceding autumn, while Scotland was yet free, and the path of honorable distinction still open before her young nobility, Wallace married Marion Braidfoot, the beautiful heiress of Lammington.  Nearly of the same age, and brought up from childhood together, reciprocal affection had grown with their growth; and sympathy of tastes and virtues, and mutual tenderness, made them so entirely one, that when at the age of twenty-two the enraptured lover was allowed to pledge that faith publicly at the altar, which he had so often vowed in secret to his Marion, he clasped her to his heart, and softly whispered: \"Dearer than life! part of my being! blessed is this union, that mingles thy soul with mine, now, and forever!\"  Edward's invasion of Scotland broke in upon their innocent joys. Wallace threw aside the wedding garment for the cuirass and the sword. But he was not permitted long to use either--Scotland submitted to her enemies; and he had no alternative but to bow to her oppressors, or to become an exile from man, amid the deep glens of his country.  The tower of Ellerslie was henceforth the lonely abode of himself and his bride.  The neighboring nobles avoided him, because the principles he declared were a tacit reproach on their proceedings; and in the course of a short time, as he forbore to seek them, they even forgot that he was in existence.  Indeed, all occasions of mixing with society he now rejected.  The hunting-spear with which he had delighted to follow the flying roebuck from glade to glade, the arrows with which he used to bring down the heavy ptarmigan or the towering eagle, all were laid aside.  Scottish liberty was no more; and Wallace would have blushed to have shown himself to the free-born deer of his native hills, in communion of sports with the spoilers of his country.  Had he pursued his once favorite exercises, he must have mingled with the English, now garrisoned in every town, and who passed their hours of leisure in the chase.  Being resigned to bury his youth--since its strength could no longer be serviceable to his country-books, his harp, and the sweet converse of his tender Marion, became the occupations of his days.  Ellerslie was his hermitage; and there, closed from the world, with an angel his companion, he might have forgotten Edward was lord in Scotland, had not that which was without his little paradise made a way to its gates, and showed him the slavery of the nobles and the wretchedness of the people.  In these cases, his generous hand gave succor where it could not bring redress.  Those whom the lawless plunderer had driven from their houses or stripped of their covering, found shelter, clothing, and food at the house of Sir William Wallace.  Ellerslie was the refuge of the friendless, and the comfort of the unhappy.  Wherever Lady Wallace moved--whether looking out from her window on the accidental passenger, or taking her morning or moonlight walks through the glen, leaning on the arm of her husband--she had the rapture of hearing his steps greeted and followed by the blessings of the poor destitute, and the prayers of them who were ready to perish. It was then that this happy woman would raise her husband's hands to her lips, and in silent adoration, thank God for blessing her with a being made so truly in his own image.  Several months of this blissful and uninterrupted solitude had elapsed, when Lady Wallace saw a chieftain at her gate.  He inquired for its master--requested a private conference--and retired with him into a remote room.  They remained together for an hour.  Wallace then came forth, and ordering his horse, with four followers, to be in readiness, said he meant to accompany his guest to Douglas Castle.  When he embraced his wife at parting, he told her that as Douglas was only a few miles distant, he should be at home again before the moon rose.  She passed the tedious hours of his absence with tranquillity, till the appointed signal of his return appeared from behind the summits of the opposite mountains.  So bright were its beams, that Marion did not need any other light to show her the stealing sands of her hour-glass, as they numbered the prolonged hours of her husband's stay.  She dismissed her servants to their rest; all, excepting Halbert, the gray-haired harper of Wallace; and he, like herself, was too unaccustomed to the absence of his master to find sleep visit his eyes while Ellerslie was bereft of its joy and its guard.  As the night advanced, Lady Wallace sat in the window of her bed-chamber, which looked toward the west.  She watched the winding pathway that led from Lanark down the opposite heights, eager to catch a glimpse of the waving plumes of her husband when he should emerge from behind the hill, and pass under the thicket which overhung the road.  How often, as a cloud obscured for an instant the moon's light, and threw a transitory shade across the path, did her heart bound with the thought that her watching was at an end!  It was he whom she had seen start from the abrupt rock!  They were the folds of his tartan that darkened the white cliff!  But the moon again rolled through her train of clouds and threw her light around.  Where then was her Wallace?  Alas! it was only a shadow she had seen! the hill was still lonely, and he whom she sought was yet far away!  Overcome with watching, expectation, and disappointment, unable to say whence arose her fears, she sat down again to look; but her eyes were blinded with tears, and in a voice interrupted by sighs she exclaimed, \"Not yet, not yet!  Ah, my Wallace, what evil hath betided thee?\"  Trembling with a nameless terror, she knew not what to dread.  She believed that all hostile recounters had ceased, when Scotland no longer contended with Edward.  The nobles, without remonstrance, had surrendered their castles into the hands of the usurper; and the peasantry, following the example of their lords, had allowed their homes to be ravaged without lifting an arm in their defense. Opposition being over, nothing could then threaten her husband from the enemy; and was not the person who had taken him from Ellerslie a friend?  Before Wallace's departure he had spoken to Marion alone; he told her that the stranger was Sir John Monteith, the youngest son of the brave Walter Lord Monteith,** who had been treacherously put to death by the English in the early part of the foregoing year.  This young man was bequeathed by his dying father to the particular charge of his friend William Lord Douglas, at that time governor of Berwick.  After the fall of that place and the captivity of its defender, Sir Jon Monteith had retired to Douglas Castle, in the vicinity of Lanark, and was now the sole master of that princely residence: James Douglas, the only son of its veteran lord, being still at Paris, whither he had been dispatched, before the defeat at Dunbar, to negotiate a league between the French monarch and the then King of Scots.  **Walter Stewart, the father of Sir John Monteith, assumed the name and earldom of Monteith in right of his wife, the daughter and heiress of the preceding earl.  When his wife died he married an Englishwoman of rank, who, finding him ardently attached to the liberties of his country, cut him off by poison, and was rewarded by the enemies of Scotland for this murder with the hand of a British nobleman.-(1809.)
