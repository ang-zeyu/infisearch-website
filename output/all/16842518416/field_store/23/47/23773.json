When my friendly companion found I could not understand him, he looked serious for a minute or two, then shortened his brilliant yellow toga, as though he had arrived at some resolve, and knelt down directly in front of me.  He next took my face between his hands, and putting his nose within an inch of mine, stared into my eyes with all his might. At first I was inclined to laugh, but before long the most curious sensations took hold of me.  They commenced with a thrill which passed all up my body, and next all feeling save the consciousness of the loud beating of my heart ceased.  Then it seemed that boy's eyes were inside my head and not outside, while along with them an intangible something pervaded my brain. The sensation at first was like the application of ether to the skin--a cool, numbing emotion.  It was followed by a curious tingling feeling, as some dormant cells in my mind answered to the thought-transfer, and were filled and fertilised!  My other brain-cells most distinctly felt the vitalising of their companions, and for about a minute I experienced extreme nausea and a headache such as comes from over-study, though both passed swiftly off.  I presume that in the future we shall all obtain knowledge in this way.  The Professors of a later day will perhaps keep shops for the sale of miscellaneous information, and we shall drop in and be inflated with learning just as the bicyclist gets his tire pumped up, or the motorist is recharged with electricity at so much per unit. Examinations will then become matters of capacity in the real meaning of that word, and we shall be tempted to invest our pocket-money by advertisements of \"A cheap line in Astrology,\" \"Try our double-strength, two-minute course of Classics,\" \"This is remnant day for Trigonometry and Metaphysics,\" and so on.  My friend did not get as far as that.  With him the process did not take more than a minute, but it was startling in its results, and reduced me to an extraordinary state of hypnotic receptibility.  When it was over my instructor tapped with a finger on my lips, uttering aloud as he did so the words--  \"Know none; know some; know little; know morel\" again and again; and the strangest part of it is that as he spoke I did know at first a little, then more, and still more, by swift accumulation, of his speech and meaning.  In fact, when presently he suddenly laid a hand over my eyes and then let go of my head with a pleasantly put question as to how I felt, I had no difficulty whatever in answering him in his own tongue, and rose from the ground as one gets from a hair-dresser's chair, with a vague idea of looking round for my hat and offering him his fee.  \"My word, sir!\" I said, in lisping Martian, as I pulled down my cuffs and put my cravat straight, \"that was a quick process.  I once heard of a man who learnt a language in the moments he gave each day to having his boots blacked; but this beats all.  I trust I was a docile pupil?\"  \"Oh, fairly, sir,\" answered the soft, musical voice of the strange being by me; \"but your head is thick and your brain tough.  I could have taught another in half the time.\"  \"Curiously enough,\" was my response, \"those are almost the very words with which my dear old tutor dismissed me the morning I left college. Never mind, the thing is done.  Shall I pay you anything?\"  \"I do not understand.\"  \"Any honorarium, then?  Some people understand one word and not the other.\"  But the boy only shook his head in answer.  Strangely enough, I was not greatly surprised all this time either at the novelty of my whereabouts or at the hypnotic instruction in a new language just received.  Perhaps it was because my head still spun too giddily with that flight in the old rug for much thought; perhaps because I did not yet fully realise the thing that had happened.  But, anyhow, there is the fact, which, like so many others in my narrative, must, alas! remain unexplained for the moment.  The rug, by the way, had completely disappeared, my friend comforting me on this score, however, by saying he had seen it rolled up and taken away by one whom he knew.  \"We are very tidy people here, stranger,\" he said, \"and everything found Lying about goes back to the Palace store-rooms.  You will laugh to see the lumber there, for few of us ever take the trouble to reclaim our property.\"  Heaven knows I was in no laughing mood when I saw that enchanted web again!  When I had lain and watched the brightening scene for a time, I got up, and having stretched and shaken my clothes into some sort of order, we strolled down the hill and joined the light-hearted crowds that twined across the plain and through the streets of their city of booths. They were the prettiest, daintiest folk ever eyes looked upon, well-formed and like to us as could be in the main, but slender and willowy, so dainty and light, both the men and the women, so pretty of cheek and hair, so mild of aspect, I felt, as I strode amongst them, I could have plucked them like flowers and bound them up in bunches with my belt. And yet somehow I liked them from the first minute; such a happy, careless, light-hearted race, again I say, never was seen before. There was not a stain of thought or care on a single one of those white foreheads that eddied round me under their peaked, blossom-like caps, the perpetual smile their faces wore never suffered rebuke anywhere; their very movements were graceful and slow, their laughter was low and musical, there was an odour of friendly, slothful happiness about them that made me admire whether I would or no.  Unfortunately I was not able to live on laughter, as they appeared to be, so presently turning to my acquaintance, who had told me his name was the plain monosyllabic An, and clapping my hand on his shoulder as he stood lost in sleepy reflection, said, in a good, hearty way, \"Hullo, friend Yellow-jerkin!  If a stranger might set himself athwart the cheerful current of your meditations, may such a one ask how far 'tis to the nearest wine-shop or a booth where a thirsty man may get a mug of ale at a moderate reckoning?\"  That gilded youth staggered under my friendly blow as though the hammer of Thor himself had suddenly lit upon his shoulder, and ruefully rubbing his tender skin, he turned on me mild, handsome eyes, answering after a moment, during which his native mildness struggled with the pain I had unwittingly given him--  \"If your thirst be as emphatic as your greeting, friend Heavy-fist, it will certainly be a kindly deed to lead you to the drinking-place. My shoulder tingles with your good-fellowship,\" he added, keeping two arms'-lengths clear of me.  \"Do you wish,\" he said, \"merely to cleanse a dusty throat, or for blue or pink oblivion?\"  \"Why,\" I answered laughingly, \"I have come a longish journey since yesterday night--a journey out of count of all reasonable mileage--and I might fairly plead a dusty throat as excuse for a beginning; but as to the other things mentioned, those tinted forgetfulnesses, I do not even know what you mean.\"  \"Undoubtedly you are a stranger,\" said the friendly youth, eyeing me from top to toe with renewed wonder, \"and by your unknown garb one from afar.\"  \"From how far no man can say--not even I--but from very far, in truth. Let that stay your curiosity for the time.  And now to bench and ale-mug, on good fellow!--the shortest way.  I was never so thirsty as this since our water-butts went overboard when I sailed the southern seas as a tramp apprentice, and for three days we had to damp our black tongues with the puddles the night-dews left in the lift of our mainsail.\"  Without more words, being a little awed of me, I thought, the boy led me through the good-humoured crowd to where, facing the main road to the town, but a little sheltered by a thicket of trees covered with gigantic pink blossoms, stood a drinking-place--a cluster of tables set round an open grass-plot.  Here he brought me a platter of some light inefficient cakes which merely served to make hunger more self-conscious, and some fine aromatic wine contained in a triple-bodied flask, each division containing vintage of a separate hue.  We broke our biscuits, sipped that mysterious wine, and talked of many things until at last something set us on the subject of astronomy, a study I found my dapper gallant had some knowledge of--which was not to be wondered at seeing he dwelt under skies each night set thick above his curly head with tawny planets, and glittering constellations sprinkled through space like flowers in May meadows.  He knew what worlds went round the sun, larger or lesser, and seeing this I began to question him, for I was uneasy in my innermost mind and, you will remember, so far had no certain knowledge of where I was, only a dim, restless suspicion that I had come beyond the ken of all men's knowledge.  Therefore, sweeping clear the board with my sleeve, and breaking the wafer cake I was eating, I set down one central piece for the sun, and, \"See here!\" I said, \"good fellow!  This morsel shall stand for that sun you have just been welcoming back with quaint ritual.  Now stretch your starry knowledge to the utmost, and put down that tankard for a moment. If this be yonder sun and this lesser crumb be the outermost one of our revolving system, and this the next within, and this the next, and so on; now if this be so tell me which of these fragmentary orbs is ours--which of all these crumbs from the hand of the primordial would be that we stand upon?\"  And I waited with an anxiety a light manner thinly hid, to hear his answer.  It came at once.  Laughing as though the question were too trivial, and more to humour my wayward fancy than aught else, that boy circled his rosy thumb about a minute and brought it down on the planet Mars!  I started and stared at him; then all of a tremble cried, \"You trifle with me!  Choose again--there, see, I will set the symbols and name them to you anew.  There now,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/604"],["title","Gulliver of Mars (#3)"],["body"," your soul tell me truly which this planet is, the one here at our feet?\"  And again the boy shook his head, wondering at my eagerness, and pointed to Mars, saying gently as he did so the fact was certain as the day above us, nothing was marvellous but my questioning.  Mars! oh, dreadful, tremendous, unexpected!  With a cry of affright, and bringing my fist down on the table till all the cups upon it leapt, I told him he lied--lied like a simpleton whose astronomy was as rotten as his wit--smote the table and scowled at him for a spell, then turned away and let my chin fall upon my breast and my hands upon my lap.  And yet, and yet, it might be so!  Everything about me was new and strange, the crisp, thin air I breathed was new; the lukewarm sunshine new; the sleek, long, ivory faces of the people new!  Yesterday--was it yesterday?--I was back there--away in a world that pines to know of other worlds, and one fantastic wish of mine, backed by a hideous, infernal chance, had swung back the doors of space and shot me--if that boy spoke true--into the outer void where never living man had been before: all my wits about me, all the horrible bathos of my earthly clothing on me, all my terrestrial hungers in my veins!  I sprang to my feet and swept my hands across my eyes.  Was that a dream, or this?  No, no, both were too real.  The hum of my faraway city still rang in my ears: a swift vision of the girl I had loved; of the men I had hated; of the things I had hoped for rose before me, still dazing my inner eye.  And these about me were real people, too; it was real earth; real skies, trees, and rocks--had the infernal gods indeed heard, I asked myself, the foolish wish that started from my lips in a moment of fierce discontent, and swept me into another sphere, another existence? I looked at the boy as though he could answer that question, but there was nothing in his face but vacuous wonder; I clapped my hands together and beat my breast; it was true; my soul within me said it was true; the boy had not lied; the djins had heard; I was just in the flesh I had; my common human hungers still unsatisfied where never mortal man had hungered before; and scarcely knowing whether I feared or not, whether to laugh or cry, but with all the wonder and terror of that great remove sweeping suddenly upon me I staggered back to my seat, and dropping my arms upon the table, leant my head heavily upon them and strove to choke back the passion which beset me.    CHAPTER III  It was the light touch of the boy An upon my shoulder which roused me. He was bending down, his pretty face full of concernful sympathy, and in a minute said--knowing nothing of my thoughts, of course.  \"It is the wine, stranger, the pink oblivion, it sometimes makes one feel like that until enough is taken; you stopped just short of what you should have had, and the next cup would have been delight--I should have told you.\"  \"Ay,\" I answered, glad he should think so, \"it was the wine, no doubt; your quaint drink, sir, tangled up my senses for the moment, but they are clearer now, and I am eager past expression to learn a little more of this strange country I have wandered into.\"  \"I would rather,\" said the boy, relapsing again into his state of kindly lethargy, \"that you learnt things as you went, for talking is work, and work we hate, but today we are all new and fresh, and if ever you are to ask questions now is certainly the time.  Come with me to the city yonder, and as we go I will answer the things you wish to know;\" and I went with him, for I was humble and amazed, and, in truth, at that moment, had not a word to say for myself.  All the way from the plain where I had awoke to the walls of the city stood booths, drinking-places, and gardens divided by labyrinths of canals, and embowered in shrubberies that seemed coming into leaf and flower as we looked, so swift was the process of their growth. These waterways were covered with skiffs being pushed and rowed in every direction; the cheerful rowers calling to each other through the leafy screens separating one lane from another till the place was full of their happy chirruping.  Every booth and way-side halting-place was thronged with these delicate and sprightly people, so friendly, so gracious, and withal so purposeless.  I began to think we should never reach the town itself, for first my guide would sit down on a green stream-bank, his feet a-dangle in the clear water, and bandy wit with a passing boat as though there were nothing else in the world to think of.  And when I dragged him out of that, whispering in his ear, \"The town, my dear boy! the town!  I am all agape to see it,\" he would saunter reluctantly to a booth a hundred yards further on and fall to eating strange confections or sipping coloured wines with chance acquaintances, till again I plucked him by the sleeve and said: \"Seth, good comrade--was it not so you called your city just now?--take me to the gates, and I will be grateful to you,\" then on again down a flowery lane, aimless and happy, wasting my time and his, with placid civility I was led by that simple guide.  Wherever we went the people stared at me, as well they might, as I walked through them overtopping the tallest by a head or more.  The drinking-cups paused half-way to their mouths; the jests died away upon their lips; and the blinking eyes of the drinkers shone with a momentary sparkle of wonder as their minds reeled down those many-tinted floods to the realms of oblivion they loved.  I heard men whisper one to another, \"Who is he?\"; \"Whence does he come?\"; \"Is he a tribute-taker?\" as I strolled amongst them, my mind still so thrilled with doubt and wonder that to me they seemed hardly more than painted puppets, the vistas of their lovely glades and the ivory town beyond only the fancy of a dream, and their talk as incontinent as the babble of a stream.  Then happily, as I walked along with bent head brooding over the incredible thing that had happened, my companion's shapely legs gave out, and with a sigh of fatigue he suggested we should take a skiff amongst the many lying about upon the margins and sail towards the town, \"For,\" said he, \"the breeze blows thitherward, and 'tis a shame to use one's limbs when Nature will carry us for nothing!\"  \"But have you a boat of your own hereabouts?\" I queried; \"for to tell the truth I came from home myself somewhat poorly provided with means to buy or barter, and if your purse be not heavier than mine we must still do as poor men do.\"  \"Oh!\" said An, \"there is no need to think of that, no one here to hire or hire of; we will just take the first skiff we see that suits us.\"  \"And what if the owner should come along and find his boat gone?\"  \"Why, what should he do but take the next along the bank, and the master of that the next again--how else could it be?\" said the Martian, and shrugging my shoulders, for I was in no great mood to argue, we went down to the waterway, through a thicket of budding trees underlaid with a carpet of small red flowers filling the air with a scent of honey, and soon found a diminutive craft pulled up on the bank.  There were some dainty cloaks and wraps in it which An took out and laid under a tree. But first he felt in the pouch of one for a sweetmeat which his fine nostrils, acute as a squirrel's, told him was there, and taking the lump out bit a piece from it, afterwards replacing it in the owner's pocket with the frankest simplicity.  Then we pushed off, hoisted the slender mast, set the smallest lug-sail that ever a sailor smiled at, and, myself at the helm, and that golden youth amidships, away we drifted under thickets of drooping canes tasselled with yellow catkin-flowers, up the blue alley of the water into the broader open river beyond with its rapid flow and crowding boats, the white city front now towering clear before us.  The air was full of sunshine and merry voices; birds were singing, trees were budding; only my heart was heavy, my mind confused.  Yet why should I be sad, I said to myself presently?  Life beat in my pulses; what had I to fear?  This world I had tumbled into was new and strange, no doubt, but tomorrow it would be old and familiar; it discredited my manhood to sit brow-bent like that, so with an effort I roused myself.  \"Old chap!\" I said to my companion, as he sat astride of a thwart slowly chewing something sticky and eyeing me out of the corner of his eyes with vapid wonder, \"tell me something of this land of yours, or something about yourself--which reminds me I have a question to ask. It is a bit delicate, but you look a sensible sort of fellow, and will take no offence.  The fact is, I have noticed as we came along half your population dresses in all the colours of the rainbow--'fancy suitings' our tailors could call it at home--and this half of the census are undoubtedly men and women.  The rub is that the other half, to which you belong, all dress alike in YELLOW, and I will be fired from the biggest gun on the Carolina's main deck if I can tell what sex you belong to! I took you for a boy in the beginning, and the way you closed with the idea of having a drink with me seemed to show I was dead on the right course.  Then a little later on I heard you and a friend abusing our sex from an outside point of view in a way which was very disconcerting. This, and some other things, have set me all abroad again, and as fate seems determined to make us chums for this voyage--why--well, frankly, I should be glad to know if you be boy or girl?  If you are as I am, no more nor less then--for I like you--there's my hand in comradeship. If you are otherwise, as those sleek outlines seem to promise--why, here's my hand again!  But man or woman you must be--come, which is it?\"  If I had been perplexed before, to watch that boy now was more curious than ever.  He drew back from me with a show of wounded dignity, then bit his lips, and sighed, and stared, and frowned.  \"Come,\" "]]]
