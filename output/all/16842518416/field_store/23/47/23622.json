Clearly $y_{4}$~must involve the time, otherwise our location of events by the four coordinates would be incomplete; but we must not too hastily identify it with the time~$t$. \\PageSep{14}  I suppose that the following would be generally accepted as a satisfactory (pre-relativity) definition of equal time-intervals:---if we have a mechanism \\index{Time!definition of}% capable of cyclic motion, its cycles will measure equal durations of time \\emph{anywhere} and \\emph{anywhen}, provided the mechanism, its laws of behaviour, and all outside influences remain precisely similar. To this the relativist would add the condition that the mechanism (as a whole) must be at rest in the space-time frame considered, because it is now known that a clock in motion goes slow in comparison with a fixed clock. The non-relativist does not disagree in fact, though he takes a slightly different view; he regards the proviso that the mechanism must be at rest as already included in his enunciation, because for him motion involves progress through the aether, which (he considers) directly affects the behaviour of the clock, and is one of those ``outside influences'' which have to be kept ``precisely similar.''  Since then it is agreed that the mechanism as a whole is to be at rest, and the moving parts return to the same positions after a complete cycle, we shall have for the two events marking the beginning and end of the cycle \\[ dx,\\ dy,\\ dz = 0. \\] Accordingly \\Eq{(4.4)} gives for this case \\[ ds^{2} = dy_{4}^{2}. \\] We have seen in \\SecRef{3} that the cycles of the mechanism in all cases correspond to equal intervals~$ds$; hence they correspond to equal values of~$dy_{4}^{2}$. But by the above definition of time they also correspond to equal lapses of time~$dt$; hence we must have $dy_{4}$~proportional to~$dt$, and we express this proportionality by writing \\[ dy_{4} = ic\\, dt, \\Tag{(4.5)} \\] where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, and $c$~is a constant. It is, of course, possible that $c$~may be an imaginary number, but provisionally we shall suppose it real. Then \\Eq{(4.4)} becomes \\[ ds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} - c^{2}\\, dt^{2}. \\Tag{(4.6)} \\]  A further discussion is necessary before it is permissible to conclude that \\Eq{(4.6)}~is the most general possible form for~$ds^{2}$ in terms of ordinary space and time coordinates. If we had reduced~\\Eq{(2.1)} to the rather more general form \\[ ds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} - c^{2}\\, dt^{2} - 2c\\alpha\\, dx\\, dt - 2c\\beta\\, dy\\, dt - 2c\\gamma\\, dz\\, dt, \\Tag{(4.7)} \\] this would have agreed with~\\Eq{(4.6)} in the only two cases yet discussed, viz.\\ (1)~when $dt = 0$, and (2)~when $dx$,~$dy$, $dz = 0$. To show that this more general form is inadmissible we must examine pairs of events which differ both in time and place.  In the preceding pre-relativity definition of~$t$ our clocks had to remain stationary and were therefore of no use for comparing time at different places. What did the pre-relativity physicist mean by the difference of time~$dt$ between two events at different places? I do not think that we can attach any meaning to his hazy conception of what $dt$~signified; but we know one \\PageSep{15} or two ways in which he was accustomed to determine it. One method which he used was that of transport of chronometers. Let us examine then what happens when we move a clock from $(x_{1}, 0, 0)$ at the time~$t_{1}$ to another place \\index{Clocks, transport of}% \\index{Time!convention in reckoning}% $(x_{2}, 0, 0)$ at the time~$t_{2}$.  We have seen that the clock, whether at rest or in motion, provided it remains a precisely similar mechanism, records equal \\emph{intervals}; hence the difference of the clock-readings at the beginning and end of the journey will be proportional to the integrated interval \\[ \\int_{1}^{2} ds. \\Tag{(4.81)} \\] If the transport is made in the direct line ($dy = 0$, $dz = 0$), we shall have according to~\\Eq{(4.7)} \\begin{align*}   -ds^{2} &= c^{2}\\, dt^{2} + 2c\\alpha\\, dx\\, dt - dx^{2}\\displaybreak[0] \\\\   &= c^{2}\\, dt^{2}\\left\\{1 + \\frac{2\\alpha}{c}\\, \\frac{dx}{dt} - \\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\right\\}. \\end{align*} Hence the difference of the clock-readings \\Eq{(4.81)} is proportional to \\[ \\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} dt \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\alpha u}{c} - \\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\Tag{(4.82)} \\] where $u = dx/dt$, i.e\\Add{.}\\ the velocity of the clock. The integral will not in general reduce to $t_{2} - t_{1}$; so that the difference of time at the two places is not given correctly by the reading of the clock. Even when $\\alpha = 0$, the moving clock does not record correct time.  Now introduce the condition that the velocity~$u$ is very small, remembering that $t_{2} - t_{1}$ will then become very large. Neglecting $u^{2}/c^{2}$, \\Eq{(4.82)}~becomes \\begin{gather*}   \\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} dt \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\, \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)\\rlap{\\qquad\\text{approximately}} \\\\   = (t_{2} - t_{1}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{c} (x_{2} - x_{1}). \\end{gather*} The clock, if moved sufficiently slowly, will record the correct time-difference if, and only if, $\\alpha = 0$. Moving it in other directions, we must have, similarly, $\\beta = 0$, $\\gamma = 0$. Thus \\Eq{(4.6)}~is the most general formula for the interval, when the time at different places is compared by slow transport of clocks from one \\index{Transport of clocks}% place to another.  I do not know how far the reader will be prepared to accept the condition that it must be possible to correlate the times at different places by moving a clock from one to the other with infinitesimal velocity. The method employed in accurate work is to send an electromagnetic signal from one to the other, and we shall see in \\SecRef{11} that this leads to the same formulae. We can scarcely consider that either of these methods of comparing time at different places is an essential part of our primitive notion of time in the same way that measurement at one place by a cyclic mechanism is; therefore \\PageSep{16} they are best regarded as conventional. Let it be understood, however, that although the relativity theory has formulated the convention explicitly, the usage of the word \\emph{time-difference} for the quantity fixed by this convention is \\index{Retardation of moving clocks}% in accordance with the long established practice in experimental physics and astronomy.  Setting $\\alpha = 0$ in~\\Eq{(4.82)}, we see that the accurate formula for the clock-reading will be \\begin{gather*}   \\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} dt (1 - u^{2}/c^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\   = (1 - u^{2}/c^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\, (t_{2} - t_{1})   \\Tag{(4.9)} \\end{gather*} for a uniform velocity~$u$. Thus a clock travelling with finite velocity gives too small a reading---the clock goes slow compared with the time-reckoning conventionally adopted.  To sum up the results of this section, if we choose coordinates such that the general quadratic form reduces to \\[ ds^{2} = dy_{1}^{2} + dy_{2}^{2} + dy_{3}^{2} + dy_{4}^{2}, \\Tag{(4.95)} \\] then $y_{1}$, $y_{2}$, $y_{3}$ and $y_{4} \\sqrt{-1}$ will represent ordinary rectangular coordinates and time. If we choose coordinates for which \\[   ds^{2} = dy_{1}^{2} + dy_{2}^{2} + dy_{3}^{2} + dy_{4}^{2}   + 2\\alpha\\, dy_{1}\\, dy_{4} + 2\\beta\\, dy_{2}\\, dy_{4} + 2\\gamma\\, dy_{3}\\, dy_{4}, \\Tag{(4.96)} \\] these coordinates also will agree with rectangular coordinates and time so far as the more primitive notions of time are concerned; but the reckoning by this formula of differences of time at different places will not agree with the reckoning adopted in physics and astronomy according to long established practice. For this reason it would only introduce confusion to admit these coordinates as a permissible space and time system.  We who regard all coordinate-frames as equally fictitious structures have no special interest in ruling out the more general form~\\Eq{(4.96)}. It is not a question of ascribing greater significance to one frame than to another, but of discovering which frame corresponds to the space and time reckoning generally accepted and used in standard works such as the Nautical Almanac.  As far as \\SecRef{14} our work will be subject to the condition that we are dealing with a region of the world in which the $g$'s are constant, or approximately constant. A region having this property is called \\emph{flat}. The theory of this \\index{Flat space-time}% \\index{Special theory of relativity}% case is called the ``special'' theory of relativity; it was discussed by Einstein in 1905---some ten years before the general theory. But it becomes much simpler when regarded as a special case of the general theory, because it is no longer necessary to defend the conditions for its validity as being essential properties of space-time. For a given region these conditions may hold, or they may not. The special theory applies only if they hold; other cases must be referred to the general theory. \\PageSep{17}  \\Section{5.}{The Lorentz transformation} \\index{Lorentz transformation}%  Make the following transformation of coordinates \\index{Transformation of coordinates!Lorentz}% \\begin{gather*}   x = \\beta(x' - ut')),\\   y = y',\\   z = z',\\   t = \\beta (t' - ux'/c^{2}),   \\Tag{(5.1)} \\\\   \\beta = (1 - u^{2}/c^{2})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}, \\end{gather*} where $u$~is any real constant not greater than~$c$.

We shall recognise $x'$,~$y'$,~$z'$ as rectangular coordinates in space, and $t'$~as the associated time. We have thus arrived at another possible way of reckoning space and time---another fictitious space-time frame, equivalent in all its properties to the original one. For convenience we say that the first reckoning is that of an observer~$S$ and the second that of an observer~$S'$, both observers being at rest in their respective spaces\\footnotemark.\\footnotetext   {This is partly a matter of nomenclature. A sentient observer can force himself to ``recollect   that he is moving'' and so adopt a space in which he is not at rest; but he does not so readily   adopt the time which properly corresponds; unless he uses the space-time frame in which he is   at rest, he is likely to adopt a hybrid space-time which leads to inconsistencies. There is no   ambiguity if the ``observer'' is regarded as merely an involuntary measuring apparatus, which by   the principles of \\SecRef{4} naturally partitions a space and time with respect to which it is at rest.}  The constant~$u$ is easily interpreted. Since $S$~is at rest in his own space, his location is given by $x = \\text{const}$. By~\\Eq{(5.1)} this becomes, in $S'$'s~coordinates, $x' - ut' = \\text{const.}$; that is to say, $S$~is travelling in the $x'$-direction with velocity~$u$. Accordingly the constant~$u$ is interpreted as the velocity of~$S$ relative to~$S'$.  It does not follow immediately that the velocity of~$S'$ relative to~$S$ is~$-u$; but this can be proved by algebraical solution of the equations~\\Eq{(5.1)} to determine $x'$,~$y'$, $z'$,~$t'$. We find \\[ x' = \\beta(x + ut),\\quad y' = y,\\quad z' = z,\\quad t' = \\beta(t + ux/c^{2}), \\Tag{(5.3)} \\] showing that an interchange of $S$ and~$S'$ merely reverses the sign of~$u$.  The essential property of the foregoing transformation is that it leaves the formula for~$ds^{2}$ unaltered~\\Eq{(5.2)}, so that the coordinate-systems which it connects are alike in their properties. Looking at the matter more generally, we have already noted that the reduction to the sum of four squares can be made in many ways, so that we can have \\[ ds^{2} = dy_{1}^{2} + dy_{2}^{2} + dy_{3}^{2} + dy_{4}^{2} = dy_{1}'^{2} + dy_{2}'^{2} + dy_{3}'^{2} + dy_{4}'^{2}. \\Tag{(5.4)} \\] \\PageSep{18} The determination of the necessary connection between any two sets of coordinates satisfying this equation is a problem of pure mathematics; we can use freely the conceptions of four-dimensional geometry and imaginary rotations to find this connection, whether the conceptions have any physical significance or not. We see from~\\Eq{(5.4)} that $ds$~is the distance between two points in four-dimensional Euclidean space, the coordinates $(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4})$ and $(y_{1}', y_{2}', y_{3}', y_{4}')$ being rectangular systems (real or imaginary) in that space. Accordingly these coordinates are related by the general transformations from one set of rectangular axes to another in four dimensions, viz.\\ translations and rotations. Translation, or change of origin, need not detain us; nor need a rotation of the space-axes $(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3})$ leaving time unaffected. The interesting case is a rotation in which $y_{4}$~is involved, typified by \\[ y_{1} = y_{1}' \\cos\\theta - y_{4}' \\sin\\theta,\\quad y_{4} = y_{1}' \\sin\\theta + y_{4}' \\cos\\theta. \\] Writing $u = ic \\tan\\theta$, so that $\\beta = \\cos\\theta$, this leads to the Lorentz transformation~\\Eq{(5.1)}.  Thus, apart from obvious trivial changes of axes, the Lorentz transformations are the only ones which leave the form~\\Eq{(4.6)} unaltered.  Historically this transformation was first obtained for the particular case of electromagnetic equations. Its more general character was pointed out by Einstein in 1905.  \\Section{6.}{The velocity of light} \\index{Addition of velocities}%  Consider a point moving along the $x$-axis whose velocity measured by~$S'$ is~$v'$, so that \\[ v' = \\frac{dx'}{dt'}. \\Tag{(6.1)} \\] Then by \\Eq{(5.1)} its velocity measured by~$S$ is \\begin{align*}   v = \\frac{dx}{dt}   &= \\frac{\\beta(dx' - u\\, dt')}{\\beta(dt' - u\\, dx'/c^{2})} \\\\   &= \\frac{v' - u}{1 - uv'/c^{2}}\\quad\\text{by \\Eq{(6.1)}.}   \\Tag{(6.2)} \\end{align*} In non-relativity kinematics we should have taken it as axiomatic that $v = v' - u$.  If two points move relatively to~$S'$ with equal velocities in opposite directions $+v'$ and~$-v'$, their velocities relative to~$S$ are \\[ \\frac{v' - u}{1 - uv'/c^{2}}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad -\\frac{v' + u}{1 + uv'/c^{2}}. \\] As we should expect, these speeds are usually unequal; but there is an exceptional case when $v' = c$. The speeds relative to~$S$ are then also equal, both in fact being equal to~$c$. \\PageSep{19}  Again it follows from~\\Eq{(5.2)} that when \\[ \\left(\\frac{dx'}{dt'}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{dy'}{dt'}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{dz'}{dt'}\\right)^{2} = c^{2}, \\] $ds = 0$, and hence \\[ \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{dz}{dt}\\right)^{2} = c^{2}. \\] Thus when the resultant velocity relative to~$S'$ is~$c$, the velocity relative to~$S$ is also~$c$, whatever the direction. We see that the velocity~$c$ has a unique and very remarkable property.  According to the older views of absolute time this result appears incredible. Moreover we have not yet shown that the formulae have practical significance, since $c$~might be imaginary. But experiment has revealed a real velocity with this remarkable property, viz.\\ $299,860$~km.\\ per~sec. We shall call this the \\emph{fundamental velocity}. \\index{Fundamental velocity}% \\index{Velocity, fundamental}%  By good fortune there is an entity---light---which travels with the fundamental \\index{Light!velocity of}% velocity. It would be a mistake to suppose that the existence of such an entity is responsible for the prominence accorded to the fundamental velocity~$c$ in our scheme; but it is helpful in rendering it more directly accessible to experiment. The Michelson-Morley experiment detected no difference in the \\index{Michelson-Morley experiment}% velocity of light in two directions at right angles. Six months later the earth's \\index{Velocity of light}% orbital motion had altered the observer's velocity by $60$~km.\\ per~sec., corresponding to the change from~$S'$ to~$S$, and there was still no difference. Hence the velocity of light has the distinctive property of the fundamental velocity.  Strictly speaking the Michelson-Morley experiment did not prove directly that the velocity of light was constant in all directions, but that the average to-and-fro velocity was constant in all directions. The experiment compared the times of a journey ``there-and-back.'' If $v(\\theta)$~is the velocity of light in the direction~$\\theta$, the experimental result is \\[ \\left. \\begin{alignedat}{2}   \\frac{1}{v(\\theta)} + \\frac{1}{v(\\theta + \\pi)} &= \\text{const.} &&= C \\\\   \\frac{1}{v'(\\theta)} + \\frac{1}{v'(\\theta + \\pi)} &= \\text{const.} &&= C' \\end{alignedat} \\right\\} \\Tag{(6.3)} \\] for all values of~$\\theta$. The constancy has been established to about $1$~part in~$10^{10}$.  It is exceedingly unlikely that the first equation could hold unless \\[ v(\\theta) = v(\\theta + \\pi) = \\text{const.}; \\] and it is fairly obvious that the existence of the second equation excludes the possibility altogether. However, on account of the great importance of the identification of the fundamental velocity with the velocity of light, we give a formal proof.  Let a ray travelling with velocity~$v$ traverse a distance~$R$ in a direction~$\\theta$, so that \\[ dt = R/v,\\quad dx = R \\cos\\theta,\\quad dy = R \\sin \\theta. \\] \\PageSep{20} Let the relative velocity of~$S$ and~$S'$ be small so that $u^{2}/c^{2}$~is neglected. Then by~\\Eq{(5.3)} \\[ dt' = dt + u\\, dx/c^{2},\\quad dx' = dx + u\\, dt,\\quad dy' = dy. \\] Writing $\\delta R$, $\\delta\\theta$, $\\delta v$ for the change in $R$,~$\\theta$,~$v$ when a transformation is made to $S'$'s~system, we obtain \\begin{align*}   \\delta(R/v) &= dt' - dt = uR \\cos \\theta/c^{2}, \\\\   \\delta(R \\cos\\theta) &= dx' - dx = uR/v, \\\\   \\delta(R \\sin\\theta) &= dy' - dy = 0.   \\intertext{Whence the values of $\\delta R$, $\\delta\\theta$, $\\delta (1/v)$ are found as follows:}   \\delta R &= uR \\cos \\theta/v, \\\\   \\delta\\theta &= -u \\sin \\theta/v, \\\\   \\delta\\left(\\frac{1}{v}\\right) &= u \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{1}{c^{2}} - \\frac{1}{v^{2}}\\right). \\end{align*}  Here $\\delta(1/v)$ refers to a comparison of velocities in the directions~$\\theta$ in~$S$'s system and $\\theta'$~in $S'$'s~system. Writing $\\Delta(1/v)$ for a comparison when the direction is~$\\theta$ in both systems \\begin{align*}   \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{v}\\right)   &= \\delta\\left(\\frac{1}{v}\\right) - \\frac{\\dd}{\\dd\\theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{v}\\right) · \\delta\\theta\\Add{,} \\\\   &= \\frac{u}{c^{2}} \\cos\\theta - \\frac{u}{v^{2}} \\cos\\theta + \\frac{u\\sin\\theta}{v}\\, \\frac{\\dd}{\\dd\\theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{v}\\right) \\\\   &= \\frac{u}{c^{2}} \\cos\\theta + \\tfrac{1}{2} u \\sin^{3}\\theta\\, \\frac{\\dd}{\\dd\\theta} \\left(\\frac{1}{v^{2} \\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right). \\end{align*} Hence \\[ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{v(\\theta)} + \\frac{1}{v(\\theta + \\pi)}\\right) = \\tfrac{1}{2} u\\sin^{3}\\theta\\, \\frac{\\dd}{\\dd\\theta}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{v^{2}(\\theta)} - \\frac{1}{v^{2}(\\theta + \\pi)}\\right)\\right\\}. \\] By~\\Eq{(6.3)} the left-hand side is independent of~$\\theta$, and equal to the constant $C' - C$. We obtain on integration \\begin{align*}   \\frac{1}{v^{2}(\\theta)} - \\frac{1}{v^{2}(\\theta + \\pi)}   &= \\frac{C' - C}{u} (\\sin^{2}\\theta · \\log\\tan \\tfrac{1}{2}\\theta - \\cos\\theta), \\\\ \\intertext{or}   \\frac{1}{v(\\theta)} - \\frac{1}{v(\\theta + \\pi)}   &= \\frac{C' - C}{C} · \\frac{1}{u} (\\sin^{2}\\theta · \\log\\tan \\tfrac{1}{2}\\theta - \\cos\\theta). \\end{align*} It is clearly impossible that the difference of~$1/v$ in opposite directions should be a"]]]
