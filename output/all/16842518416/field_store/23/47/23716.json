Many precious truths the angel now imparted to him: telling him that he, Moroni, while yet living, had hidden up the plates in the hill, four centuries after Christ, to await their coming forth in the destined hour of God's mercy to man; that he, Moroni, was the son of Mormon, a prophet of the ancient Nephites, who had once dwelt on this land; that to the Nephites this sacred hill was known as Cumorah, and to the Jaredites (who had still more anciently inhabited this continent), as Ramah; and much more did he impart to Joseph concerning the mysteries of the past, and the future purposes of Almighty God in the redemption of fallen mankind.  Then the kingdom of Heaven, in all its majesty, and the dominion of the Prince of darkness, in all its terror, were brought to Joseph's vision, and Moroni said:  \"ALL THIS IS SHOWN, THE GOOD AND THE EVIL, THE HOLY AND THE IMPURE, THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE POWER OF DARKNESS, THAT YOU MAY KNOW HEREAFTER THE TWO POWERS, AND NEVER BE INFLUENCED OR OVERCOME BY THAT WICKED ONE.\"  Joseph restored the cover to the box and replaced the earth; and when the Heavenly messenger had ended the counsel and disappeared, the youth again sought his home, marveling greatly at the goodness and infinite power of his Creator.  Happily for the comfort of the chosen Prophet, at this hour he met help within the family circle. He imparted to his parents and the older children all that he had been empowered to reveal; and their understanding and faith were quickened to the acceptance of the truth. They learned to know of a surety that God had spoken and that Joseph must obey.  On each recurrence of the twenty-second day of September during the next three years, Joseph visited the hill Cumorah. Each time he opened the box, viewed its precious contents, and then restored the hiding place to its former appearance. Each time, the messenger visited him on that consecrated spot; chastening him to patience, exacting anew a covenant of self-sacrificing fidelity to the trust, and extending the counsels and instructions pertaining to the re-establishment, at the proper hour, of the Church of Christ upon the earth.  This continued communion wrought God's purpose with Joseph. It gave him a comprehension of the destiny of man, both earthly and eternal; unfolding to his view the progression of his race, from heaven through the probation of this world and back to the judgment seat of Omnipotence. It filled him with a burning zeal, and a higher wisdom than that taught in the schools began to expand his intellect; he was learning the sublime principle of just government; he was being fitted to become the instrument to re-establish the Church which should endure until the coming of Christ to reign therein in glory. Out of His all-compassing power, the Lord gave to this unlearned youth, from year to year, knowledge according to the hour of his need; and the bestowal of this heavenly wisdom was continued to Joseph through all the vicissitudes of the mortality which culminated in that awful day at Carthage.  Footnotes  1. See NOTE 2., APPENDIX.    CHAPTER VI.  JOSEPH'S WILLING TOIL--FOUR YEARS OF WAITING--HE FINDS WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA--HIS MARRIAGE WITH EMMA HALE--THE PROBATION COMPLETED.  When Joseph first stood upon the sacred hill Cumorah, he was in his eighteenth year. The time in which the human character most strongly assumes its shaping was to be with him the ensuing four years.  Wondrous as had been the vision of the host of Heaven and the ranks of Lucifer; exalting as were the communications from the Lord; mighty as was to be the mission of translation; yet Joseph had day by day the humble labors of life to perform. Without a murmur he accepted his lot of toil, working with his hands to aid in the family maintenance, while his mind was busy with eternal truths. There is always a heroism in the honest, uncomplaining home-toil of youth: a necessary heroism, indeed, for without the early-formed habit of industry for man, the Almighty's purposes concerning mankind would fail. And that heroism is doubly beautiful in the life of Joseph, who knew already his destiny, divinely ordained. Left much to itself in the selfishness of earth, a weaker or an unsustained soul would have wasted its powers in vain dreamings or found its destruction in pride and self-glory.  The sweat of the face, therefore, was at once a necessity and a salutation: a requisite for the family welfare and comfort; a protection from enervating dreams. No husbandman of all that neighborhood was more industrious than he; and, except for the hatred bred against him by false teachers and their followers, no one would have had a better reputation.  As the younger sons of the family grew into vigor, the small farm and the home duties less exacted the diligence of Joseph; and when an opportunity came, in his twentieth year, for remunerative employment at a distance, he willingly accepted the offer. The engagement carried him to Susquehanna County, State of Pennsylvania, where the employer, Josiah Stoal, though dwelling in New York State, had some property upon which Joseph worked, while he boarded at the neighboring house of Mr. Isaac Hale. Stoal conceived the idea that there were signs of a silver deposit in his land, and he put his farming men to the work of mining. It was soon evident that he had become infatuated with the hope of achieving sudden and extraordinary wealth and was squandering his means in a pursuit which gave no promise of an adequate return. Joseph, who had become a favorite with Mr. Stoal because of industry and good judgment, remonstrated with him, and finally influenced him to withdraw from his sordid and fruitless project.  Isaac Hale had a daughter, Emma, a good girl of high mind and devout feelings. This worthy young woman and Joseph formed a mutual attachment, and her father was requested to give his permission to their marriage. Mr. Hale opposed their desire for a time, as he was prosperous while Joseph's people had lost their property; and it was on the 18th day of January, 1827, the last year of waiting for the plates, before Joseph and Emma could accomplish their desired union. On that day they were married by one Squire Tarbill, at the residence of that gentleman, in South Bainbridge, in Chenango County, New York. Immediately after the marriage, Joseph left the employ of Mr. Stoal and journeyed with his wife to his parental home at Manchester, where during the succeeding summer, he worked to obtain means for his family and his mission. The time was near at hand for the great promise to be fulfilled and for his patience and faithfulness to be rewarded.  As the hour approached for the delivery of the ancient record into his hands, Joseph prayed earnestly for humility and strength. He had not failed in any of his prescribed visits to Cumorah. Even when at work in Pennsylvania, he had obtained temporary release that he might journey to the hill and meet his Heavenly teacher.  His wife, his parents and brethren were made participants in his hopes, and they added their faith to his, and gave their hearty support to his labor and preparation.  The 21st day of September, 1827, completed the fourth year since Moroni first appeared at Joseph's bedside, and the occasion was deemed a fitting hour for prayer and thanksgiving. In that humble home God's chosen servant and his kindred offered their adoration to the beneficent Father. It was also a time for the review of the trying years since the call first came to Joseph. The family had remained in honest lowliness, unmoved by the assaults and ridicule of the world. Alvin, the eldest son of Joseph and Lucy, had died on the 19th of November, 1824, with a firm belief in the coming of the New Dispensation and with words of comfort and blessing for his brother Joseph upon his lips. The faithful Hyrum, like Joseph, was happily wed. And the younger children were nearly all at years of understanding.  Quiet came with the darkness, and peace dwelt upon the house and by the pillows of this devoted family. The tranquility of the night was long remembered, for it was almost the last time they had on earth in unfearing and undisturbed enjoyment of each other's society.    CHAPTER VII.  FINAL VISIT TO CUMORAH--DELIVERY OF THE PLATES BY THE ANGEL MORONI-- SOLEMN CAUTION TO JOSEPH--ATTACKS BY ASSASSINS AND ROBBERS--POVERTY AND PERSECUTION--HELP FROM MARTIN HARRIS--REMOVAL TO PENNSYLVANIA.  For the fifth time Joseph stood by the place of deposit of the stone box and its precious contents, which for fourteen centuries had remained concealed from human vision and undisturbed by mortal hand. It was the morning of the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven. For the last time he removed the soil and lifted the stone cover, while he prayed that he might be as faithful to his trust as had been the inanimate hillside. The angel of the Lord was at his side and bade him stretch forth his hands and take from their long hiding place the Urim and Thummim and the record.  Joseph touched them and his being was thrilled with a divine joy. He lifted them to the surface and examined their beauty.  The Urim and Thummim was as the angel had described it--two precious stones set in an arch of silver which was fastened to an ancient breastplate of pure gold, curiously wrought. The breastplate was concave on one side and convex on the other, and seemed to have been made for a man of greater stature than is ordinary in modern days. Four golden bands were fastened to it, for the purpose of attaching it to the person of its wearer--two of the bands being for the shoulders, the others for the waist or hips.  The plates, also of gold, were of uniform size; each was slightly less in thickness than a common sheet of tin and was about eight inches in width; and all were bound together by three rings,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],["title","The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#7)"],["body","through one edge of the plates. Thus secured, they formed a book about six inches in thickness. A part of the volume, about one-third, was sealed; the other leaves Joseph turned with his hand. They were covered on both sides with strange characters, small and beautifully engraved.  Moroni instructed Joseph that he must not attempt to open that part of the book which was sealed, for the hour had not come wherein it was destined to be made known; but in God's accepted time he would bring that portion of the record to the knowledge of His children. Then the angel repeated all that he had formerly said in advice and blessing. Joseph was told that the Lord expected him to shield the record from profane touch and sight, even with his life, until his work of translation should be completed and the plates restored to the hands of Moroni; that all the former guardians had relinquished their trust and he alone would be held accountable for their safety; that efforts would be made to rob him of the holy writings, but if he proved faithful the Heavens would give their aid to his support and he would come off triumphant. And he was finally and solemnly warned that if he should betray his mission he must be cut off and destroyed.  With a crowning promise to Joseph that he should not be left to grope in darkness, and that upon the conclusion of the labor of translation, the angel would visit him and again receive the plates, Moroni disappeared, and THE PROPHET OF THE LAST DISPENSATION stood alone upon Cumorah, clasping to his bosom the priceless trust.  Joseph folded the golden record of past generations beneath his mantle and sped homeward. The words of Moroni had been prophetic; three different times in the brief journey to his house, the chosen minister of salvation was assailed by unknown men--emissaries of the evil one, who sought to strike him to the earth and rob him of his precious charge. Once they dealt him a terrific blow with a bludgeon, but he did not fall. He was a man of rare physical endowments, yet on this occasion his own strength and activity, without the help of the Lord, would not have delivered him or been sufficient to cast his assailants one by one prone in the dust with the irresistible force which he used against them.  With the plates unharmed, but himself bruised, and panting from the contest, Joseph reached his home.  After this important hour the powers of darkness arrayed all their subtle and murderous influences against him. Abominable falsehoods were cunningly circulated against him and his father's family, the purpose being to excite the rage of the populace against them. Constantly the Prophet's life was beset by assassins; the sacred record was sought by robbers. Each hour brought some new menace. Men, lurking by his pathway, discharged deadly weapons at his person; and mobs attacked him and invaded his home. Wherever the plates were supposed to be hidden, there were the despoilers breaking through bolts and walls. Open force failing, subtle stratagems were devised for the destruction of the Prophet's life and the abstraction of the plates.  These numerous efforts all failed to accomplish the ends at which they were aimed. But they prevented Joseph from obtaining the safe leisure necessary for his labor of translation. Anxious to pursue his heaven-appointed work without the interruption of these continued attacks, he was led to the idea of removing from Manchester. Personal fear was not an element of his nature, and no selfish motive prompted his resolve; but in no other visible manner could his sacred instructions be fulfilled. The home of Emma's parents in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, was the place which he selected, and thither he determined to journey.  Poverty seemed, however, to present an insurmountable barrier; but it was suddenly removed. Martin Harris, a prosperous and respected farmer of Wayne County, New York, and who was destined in the providence of God to afterwards fill an important part in connection with the divine record, was inspired to come to Joseph with a free offer of help. By the aid thus extended, the Prophet was able to take his departure to Manchester, carrying with him his wife and the sacred plates. As Joseph and Mary were warned to flee with the infant Jesus into Egypt to escape the destruction which Herod had planned, so the Prophet was led to seek another place of residence for the performance of his labor.  But Satan was not idle. Twice while on the journey was the servant of God stopped by officers, who, under a pretended warrant of law, searched his wagon for the plates. But the angel of the Lord blinded the eyes of the wicked and they found not what they sought.  It was in the month of December, 1827, when Joseph reached the house of Isaac Hale in Pennsylvania; and without delay he began his inspired work of translation by the aid of the seer stones.  It may seem strange and unaccountable that such extraordinary efforts should be made to destroy this young man and to get possession of the plates with which he had been entrusted. But his whole life from this time forward until he sealed his testimony with his blood was filled with incidents of the most remarkable character. The words of the angel were that God had a work for Joseph to do, and that his name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds and tongues; or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people; and they were fulfilled to the letter. No man of this generation was so passionately loved; no man was so cruelly hated. Satan knew that if the work of which God had chosen him to be the founder on the earth should prevail, his power and dominion should be overthrown. Against this Prophet, therefore, the profoundest depths of hell were stirred up. While he lived he was the target at which the most deadly shafts of Satan were directed. For the succeeding sixteen or seventeen years from the time of which we write his steps were beset by peril. Violence and murder lurked in his pathway. He was never free from menace. Through his life he enjoyed peace, but it was the peace that came from above and not that which arises from auspicious surroundings and undisturbed quiet. He was a happy man; but his happiness was never due to worldly favor or popularity. God had endowed him with a buoyancy of spirit and a strength of faith that the most deadly opposition and the most threatening difficulties could not repress; with a courage which, in the midst of brutal mobs howling for his blood, never faltered or was quenched. His was a stormy career; but he was amply qualified for it. As he himself said on one occasion:      And as for perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but     a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my     common lot all the days of my life, and for what cause it seems     mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of     the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it.     Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things whether it be     good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim     in. It has all become a second nature to me, and I feel like Paul,     to glory in tribulation, for to this day has the God of my fathers     delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth;     for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the     Lord God hath spoken it.    CHAPTER VII.  JOSEPH COPIES AND TRANSLATES FROM THE PLATES--MARTIN HARRIS AGAIN COMES OPPORTUNELY--PROFESSOR ANTHON AND THE CHARACTERS--MARTIN'S LABOR AS A SCRIBE--HIS BROKEN TRUST--THE TRANSLATION LOST TO JOSEPH--THE PROPHET PUNISHED FOR WILFULNESS.  Joseph's first labor with the plates was in obedience to the general command given to him through Moroni. The particular means by which the translation was to be effected and given to the world had not been made known; and this young, untaught, impoverished man was at that hour unable, within his own resources of education and purse, to arrange for the consummation of the work. He devoted every available moment, however, to his sacred task, constantly praying to the Almighty for aid; and yet the progress was slow.  In every step which Joseph took as the chosen messenger of God, human struggle and sacrifice, to overcome perplexing difficulties and delays, seemed necessary. In this way more than any other was he taught a patient trust, and was sanctified for the exalted destiny which awaited him. Though he had been instructed by Moroni that Jehovah designed the record to be translated for the edification and blessing of the race, he did not experience the direct interposition of God in the accomplishment of the work--except only as the power of the Heavens was manifested through the Urim and Thummim. And much he marveled that the Lord should permit His holy purposes to depend upon weak and slow-moving man. But the Prophet lived to learn and to demonstrate that God commits His decrees to His earthly children for fulfilment; and though he may often work miracles in their behalf, yet are they required to give their best endeavor--even though weak and human--to the appointed deed; and out of their trials, their stumblings, their failures and their ultimate successes, will he bring the triumph of their devotion and His word.  Joseph had leisure and safety, after establishing himself at the house of Isaac Hale, in Harmony, Susquehanna County, State of Pennsylvania, in the month of December, 1827, to examine the sacred history and treasure which had been committed to his ward. And he very soon began a somewhat desultory labor of copying the different styles of strange characters found upon the plates and translating some of them by the aid of the Urim and Thummim. He thus prepared a considerable number of characters on sheets; some of them being accompanied by translations and others being alone. It does not appear that he had "]]]
