Otherwise there is no existence.\" (Doc. & Cov., Sec. 93.)_  DISCUSSION.  _1. Of the Nature of Moral Freedom:_ The controversy in the heavenly council between Christ and Lucifer, gives emphasis to the importance of man's agency--his freedom to will and to do as he shall elect. The choice of the Christ as the Redeemer of the world cannot be regarded as being connected with any event by which the agency or moral freedom of Intelligences was then created. It was the maintenance of that which already existed rather than the creation of any new thing which was involved. Indeed the moral freedom of Intelligences is something which is as eternal as they are. Freedom is an attribute of Intelligences and may not be taken from them without robbing them of all joy and glory and dignity of existence. \"Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be. All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all Intelligence also, otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man and here is the condemnation of man, because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light. And every man who receiveth not the light is under condemnation, for man is spirit.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov., Sec. 93:30-33.]  Whenever God, therefore, speaks of the agency or moral freedom of man,[A] reference is had to the spirit or Intelligence which constitutes the real man, \"for man is spirit,\" that is, mind, Intelligence is the real fact of him. All truth and all Intelligences are independent in that sphere in which God has placed them, to act for themselves, otherwise there is no existence (see above quotation). That is to say, there is no existence where this fact of the freedom of truth and of Intelligences does not obtain. Freedom of man, then, means freedom of the Intelligence which is the chief fact of man; freedom in all estates through which he shall be called to pass, in all spheres in which God shall place him to act, the quality of freedom never leaves him. In obedience or in rebellion against God, it is his freedom that keeps him in either condition, and ministers to his joy or his misery respectively.  [Footnote A: It will be observed that these terms are used interchangeably.]  \"I know,\" says the Nephite Prophet Alma, \"that he [God] granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he alloteth unto men, according to their wills; whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction\" (xxix:4).  The second Nephi says: \"The Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\"[A] Upon these principles it is manifest that God designed that freedom should follow Intelligences into their earth-life.  [Footnote A: II Nephi ii:27.]  _2. Moral Freedom to Follow Man in all Estates:_ When the earthlife was proposed, Intelligences were about to exercise that freedom in a new sphere of existence; in a new environment, under new, and to them, doubtless, strange conditions. The plan Lucifer proposed involved the destruction of his freedom. \"Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man,\" says the Lord. \"Here am I,\" said Lucifer, \"send me. I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind that not one soul shall be lost.\"[A] Under this plan, Intelligences were to have an earth-life in which there would be no losses; a world where there was nothing adventurous and dangerous, a \"game\" in which there are no real stakes; all that was \"hazarded\" would be given back. All must be saved; and no price is to be paid in the work of salvation. The last word is to be sweet. All is to be \"yes,\" \"yes\" in the universe.[B] The fact of \"no\" was nowhere to stand at the core of things. There could be no seriousness attributed to life under such a plan, since there were to be no insuperable \"noes\" and \"losses;\" no genuine sacrifices anywhere; nothing permanently drastic and bitter to remain at the bottom of the cup. \"I will redeem all mankind, that not one soul shall be lost,\" said Lucifer; \"and surely I will do it.\" Man was to have nothing to do in the achievement, all was to be done for him. He was to be passive, merely. Not a thing to act, but something to be acted upon. Such only could be the outcome of a world where all mankind would be saved, \"that not one soul should be lost.\" It would be an utterly meaningless world. Without heroism; listless indifference would claim it. Passage through such an estate would add nothing to Intelligences. And yet, beyond question, there were natures among the Intelligences of heaven that longed for such a scheme of things, so much they dreaded danger, adventure and the stress of life that comes from individual struggle and individual responsibility. \"Give us ease, let us have things done for us without our concern and the pain of striving,\" is their cry. And a third part of the hosts of heaven Lucifer turned away from the Lord in that day, because they made this election, and they became the devil and his angels (Doc. & Cov., Sec. xxix).  [Footnote A: Book of Moses, Ch. iv:4.]  [Footnote B: The expressions here used are a paraphrase of a passage in a lecture of the late Prof. Wm. James, on \"Pragmatism\" (page 295), on the thought, \"May not the notion of a world already saved in toto anyhow, be too saccharine to stand.\"]  _3. The Thoughts of a Modern Philosopher:_ Mr. Wm. James, in his \"Pragmatism,\" has a very wonderful passage bearing upon the whole thought here dwelt upon; and it is so pregnant with suggestion relative to our theme, so supported by philosophical thought and analysis of human nature, both strong and weak, that one marvels at the idea and thought in it which so parallels our own doctrines advanced in the Book of Moses--the doctrines above considered and given to the Church, in large part, in the very first years of her existence.[A] The following is the passage from Mr. James:  [Footnote A: For full account of the Book of Moses, see Seventy's Year Book. No. I, Lessons v and vi. It was published in full by F. D. Richards in the Pearl of Great Price, 1851, Liverpool, England.]      \"Suppose that the world's Author put the case to you before     creation, saying: 'I am going to make a world not certain to be     saved, a world the perfection of which shall be conditional merely,     the condition being that each several agent does its own \"level     best.\" I offer you the chance of taking part in such a world.     Its safety, you see, is unwarranted. It is a real adventure,     with real danger, yet it may win through. It is a social scheme     of co-operative work genuinely to be done. Will you join the     procession? Will you trust yourself and trust the other agents     enough to face the risk?      \"Should you, in all seriousness, if participation in such a     world were proposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not safe     enough? Would you say that, rather than be part and parcel of so     fundamentally pluralistic and irrational a universe, you preferred     to relapse into the slumber of nonentity from which you had been     momentarily aroused by the tempter's voice?[A]  [Footnote A: Of course this proposition of relapsing into \"nonentity\" is no part of the \"Mormon\" scheme of thought, since the actual proposition of our revelations was made to Intelligences alike uncreated and uncreatable, and alike indestructible; so that while in the exercise of their freedom these Intelligences might decline participation in the scheme of things proposed, they could not sink back into nonentities.]      \"Of course, if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing     of the sort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy in most of us which     such a universe would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the     offer--'Top! and schlag auf schlag!\" It would be just like the     world we practically live in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature     would forbid us to say no. The world proposed would seem 'rational'     to us in the most living way.      \"Most of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add     our fiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhaps some would not;     for there are morbid minds in every human collection, and to them     the prospect of a universe with only a fighting chance of safety     would probably make no appeal. There are moments of discouragement     in us all, when we are sick of self and tired of vainly striving.     Our own life breaks down, and we fall into the attitude of the     prodigal son. We mistrust the chances of things. We want a universe     where we can just give up, fall on our father's neck,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60492"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fifth Year (#0)"],["body","(https://mormontextsproject.org/), with thanks to Rachel Helps and BYU Transcribe       The Seventy's Course in Theology  Fifth Year  Divine Immanence and the Holy Ghost  By B.

I. THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTY'S SPECIAL COURSE IN THEOLOGY.  [Footnote: It is suggested that this Introduction be treated in the class as a lesson.]  This Introduction is intended to serve two purposes: an Introduction to the treatise which follows; and a valedictory to the \"Seventy's Course in Theology.\" The latter has reached a period, for the present at least, as arrangements are being made to have prepared one course of study in successive annual manuals for the three quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Seventies, High Priests, and Elders Quorums. The reasons for making this change are that the \"Gospel is one;\" that the duty of becoming acquainted with it rests equally upon High Priests, Seventies, and Elders; that which will qualify one of these quorums to preach this one gospel abroad, will qualify the others for preaching it at home; and _vice versa_. Each of these quorums, where there is a sufficient number in each to form a good, strong class, will still continue, as now, in their separate classes, though studying the same manual. Where the quorums in the smaller wards are not strong enough in numbers to assure a good class separately, they can meet conjointly for class work and under such circumstances, having the same text book, will be a very great advantage. The plan will also economize both time and money in the matter of publishing manuals; for it is patent that one text book can more readily be produced than three, and at less expense.  These considerations, it is hoped, will outweigh any feeling of disappointment which but for them might arise over the discontinuance of the Seventy's special course in Theology; and then, undoubtedly, when the new and united course shall be opened, we may reasonably expect that its lines will be laid on a much larger ground plan, and in its development there will be employed brethren of such scholarship and talent as shall warrant the expectation of the very best text books that can be produced on the great theme of which they will treat--the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.  II. SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT YEAR BOOK.  So much for the \"valedictory\" part of this Introduction; and now as to the subject of the present Year Book. We have here the consideration of a theme in some respects the loftiest and mightest that the mind of man can be led to contemplate: God Immanent in the world; and God in union with men through the medium of the Holy Ghost. Confessedly the subject is one around which much of mystery gathers; and there are not wanting those who, on that account, are in favor of leaving it so, without attempting an exposition of the nature or offices of the Spirit Immanent in the world, and the Spirit Witness to the soul of man. I think no one can be more conscious of human limitations to understand divine things than I am. And I doubt if any one can have greater appreciation of the need of being careful to keep within the limits of what God has revealed upon these subjects; for it is only what he has revealed that can rightly instruct men in the things of God. Moreover in no department is the frank and honest confession \"I don't know,\" more imperative than in Theology; and when it is given as an actual confession of having reached the limits of our knowledge, it is worthy of all praise. But if it becomes tainted with the spirit of \"I don't care,\" then I have no respect for it.  III. MENTAL EFFORT REQUIRED TO MASTER THE THINGS OF GOD.  There is another phase in which the same thing occurs. It requires striving--intellectual and spiritual--to comprehend the things of God--even the revealed things of God. In no department of human endeavor is the aphorism \"no excellence without labor\"--more in force than in acquiring knowledge of the things of God. The Lord has placed no premium upon idleness or indifference here--\"seek and ye shall find;\" \"knock and it shall be opened unto you;\" \"seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study and also by faith\"--such the admonitions God gives in reference to our pursuit of knowledge of divine things.  Oliver Cowdery thought the work of translating from the Nephite plates would be easy. He sought the privilege of translating and was given an opportunity. He, it appears, believed that all that would be necessary would be for him to ask God, and without giving further thought the translation would be given him. His expectation in this was disappointed. He failed to translate. Then the Lord said: \"You supposed that I would give it [i. e., the power to translate] unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me; but behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore you shall feel that it is right.\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 9.)  The incident illustrates the truth here contended for--achievement in divine things, progress in the knowledge of them, comes only with hard striving, earnest endeavor, determined seeking.  IV. THE PLEA OF \"THUS FAR, BUT NO FURTHER.\"  Mental laziness is the vice of men, especially with reference to divine things. Men seem to think that because inspiration and revelation are factors in connection with the things of God, therefore the pain and stress of mental effort are not required; that by some means these elements act somewhat as Elijah's ravens and feed us without effort on our part. To escape this effort, this mental stress to know the things that are, men raise all too readily the ancient bar--\"Thus far shalt thou come, but no farther.\" Man cannot hope to understand the things of God, they plead, or penetrate those things which he has left shrouded in mystery. \"Be thou content with the simple faith that accepts without question. To believe, and accept the ordinances, and then live the moral law will doubtless bring men unto salvation; why then should man strive and trouble himself to understand? Much study is still a weariness of the flesh.\" So men reason; and just now it is much in fashion to laud \"the simple faith;\" which is content to believe without understanding, or even without much effort to understand. And doubtless many good people regard this course as indicative of reverence--this plea in bar of effort--\"thus far and no farther.\" \"There is often a great deal of intellectual sin concealed under this old aphorism,\" remarks Henry Drummond. \"When men do not really wish to go farther they find it an honorable convenience sometimes to sit down on the outmost edge of the 'holy ground' on the pretext of taking off their shoes.\" \"Yet,\" he continues, \"we must be certain that, making a virtue of reverence, we are not merely excusing ignorance; or under the plea of 'mystery' evading a truth which has been stated in the New Testament a hundred times, in the most literal form, and with all but monotonous repetition.\" (Spiritual Law, pp. 89, 90.)  This sort of \"reverence\" is easily simulated, and is of such flattering unction, and so pleasant to follow--\"soul take thine ease\"--that without question it is very often simulated; and falls into the same category as the simulated humility couched in \"I don't know,\" which so often really means \"I don't care, and do not intend to trouble myself to find out.\"  V. THE PRAISE OF SIMPLE FAITH.  I maintain that \"simple faith\"--which is so often ignorant and simpering acquiescence, and not faith at all--but simple faith taken at its highest value, which is faith without understanding of the thing believed, is not equal to intelligent faith, the faith that is the gift of God, supplemented by earnest endeavor to find through prayerful thought and research a rational ground for faith--for acceptance of truth; and hence the duty of striving for a rational faith in which the intellect as well as the heart--the feeling--has a place and is a factor.  But, to resume: This plea in bar of effort to find out the things that are, is as convenient for the priest as it is for the people. The people of \"simple faith,\" who never question, are so much easier led, and so much more pleasant every way--they give their teachers so little trouble. People who question because they want to know, and who ask adult questions that call for adult answers, disturb the ease of the priests. The people who question are usually the people who think--barring chronic questioners and cranks, of course--and thinkers are troublesome, unless the instructors who lead them are thinkers also; and thought, eternal, restless thought, that keeps out upon the frontiers of discovery, is as much a weariness to the slothful, as it is a joy to the alert and active and noble minded. Therefore one must not be surprised if now and again he finds those among religious teachers who give encouragement to mental laziness under the pretense of \"reverence;\" praise \"simple faith\" because they themselves, forsooth, would avoid the stress of thought and investigation that would be necessary in order to hold their place as leaders of a thinking people.
