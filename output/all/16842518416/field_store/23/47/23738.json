With songs of rejoicing to Zion return,       And sorrow and sighing shall flee;   The powers of heaven among you come down.       And Christ in the centre will be.    And then all the watchmen shall see eye to eye,       When the Lord shall bring Zion again;   The wolf and the kid down together shall lie,       And the lion shall dwell with the lamb.    The earth shall be filled with knowledge of God,       And nothing shall hurt or destroy,   And these are the tidings we have to proclaim,--       Glad tidings abounding with joy.    THE HARMONY OF NATURE, OR FREEDOM, PEACE, AND LOVE.    Hark! listen to the gentle breeze,       O'er hill or valley, plain or grove,   It whispers in the ears of man,       The voice of freedom, peace and love.    The flowers that bloom o'er all the land,   In harmony and order stand,   Nor hatred, pride or envy know,   In freedom, peace and love they grow.    The birds their numerous notes resound,   In songs of praise the earth around,   Their voices and their tongues employ,   In songs of freedom, love and joy.    And then behold the crystal stream,   With multitudes of fishes teem;   In silent joy they live and move,   In freedom, union, peace and love.  SECOND PART.    The mountains high, the rivers clear,   Where heaven sheds her dews and tears,   In silence, or with gentle roar,   The God of love and peace adore.    The earth, and air, and sea, and sky,   The holy spirit from on high,   And angels who above do reign,   Cry peace on earth, good will to men.    But most of all a Saviour's love,   Was manifested from above,   He died and rose to life again,   Our freedom, love and peace to gain.    But man,--vile man, alone seems lost,   With hatred, pride and envy tossed,   His hardened soul does seldom move,   In freedom, union, peace or love.    For him, let all creation mourn;   O'er him did Enoch's bosom yearn,   Till he was promised from above,   A day of freedom, peace and love.    INHERITANCE OF THE SAINTS.  \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\"    This earth shall be a blessed place,       To saints celestial given;   Where Christ again shall show his face,   With the redeemed of Adam's race,       In clouds descend from heaven.    Yes, when he comes on earth again,       The wicked burn as stubble;   Thus all his enemies are slain,   And o'er the nations he shall reign,       And end the scenes of trouble.    The trump of war is heard no more,       But all their strife is ended;   While Jesus shall all things restore   To order, as they were before,       And peace o'er all extended.    Sing, O ye heavens! let earth rejoice,       While saints shall flow to Zion,   And rear the temple of his choice,   And in its courts unite their voice,       In praise to Judah's Lion.    Hosanna to the reign of peace!       The day so long expected;   When earth shall find a full release,   The groanings of creation cease,       The righteous well protected.    Come, sound his praise in joyful strains.       Who dwell beneath his banner;   He'll bind old Satan fast in chains,   And wide o'er earth's extended plains,       The nations shout _Hosanna._    REDEMPTION OF ZION.    Lo, far in the realms of Missouri,   When peace crowns the meek and the lowly,   The loud storms of envy and folly       May roll all their billows in vain.    The wicked, with evil intention,   May rouse all their powers of invention,   With lying, intrigue and contention,       Their end will be sorrow and pain.    The saints, crowned with songs of rejoicing,   To Zion shall flow from all nations,   Escaping the great conflagration,       They find out the regions of peace.    Though scattered and driven asunder.   As exiles and pilgrims to wander,   A scene on which angels do ponder,       Yet Jesus will bring their release.    When empires of Babel shall tumble,   Their fabrics in ashes shall crumble,   The Lord will provide for the humble       A city of refuge and peace.    There, there the Lord will deliver   The soul of each faithful believer,   And save them forever and ever,       And sorrow and sighing shall cease.    The saints for those blessings aspire,   And wait with exceeding desire,   Till earth shall be cleansed by fire,       And they their inheritance gain.    Hosanna, such blessings inspire   A song from the heavenly choir,   They sing of the coming Messiah,       From heaven in glory to reign.    REFLECTIONS ON A SUMMER EVENING.    Another day has fled and gone,       The sun declines in western skies,   The birds retired, have ceased their song,       Let ours in pure devotion rise.    The moon her splendid course resumes,       She sheds her light o'er land and sea,   The gentle dews in soft perfumes       Fall sweetly o'er each herb and tree.    While here in meditation sweet,       Those happy hours I call to mind,   When with the saints I oft have met,       Our hearts in pure devotion joined.    Those friends afar I call to mind,       When shall we meet again below;   Their hearts affectionate and kind,       How did they soothe my grief and woe.    As flow'rets in their brightest bloom,       Are withered by the chilling blast,   So man's fond hopes are like a dream,       His days how fleet, how swift they pass.    But cease this melancholy moan,       Nor sigh for those who will not come,   For Israel surely will return       To Zion and Jerusalem.    There is a source of pure delight       For ever shall support my heart:   For Zion's land's revealed to sight,       Where saints will meet no more to part.    MISSION OF THE TWELVE.    How fleet the precious moments roll,       How soon the harvest will be o'er:   The watchmen seek their final rest,       And lift a warning voice no more.    Another year has roll'd away       And took its thousands to the tomb;   Its sorrows and its joys are fled,       To hasten on the general doom.    And eighteen hundred thirty five.       Is rolling swiftly on the wing,   And soon the leaves and tendrils thrive;       A token of returning spring.    The fulness of the gospel shines       With glorious and resplendent rays;   The earth and heav'ns show forth their signs.       As tokens of the latter days.  SECOND PART.    Ye chosen twelve, to you are given,       The keys of this last ministry--   To every nation under heaven,       From land to land, from sea to sea.    First to the Gentiles sound the news       Throughout Columbia's happy land,   And then before it reach the Jews,       Prepare on Europe's shores to stand.    Let Europe's towns and cities hear       The gospel tidings angels bring;   The Gentile nations far and near,       Prepare their hearts His praise to sing.    India's and Afric's sultry plains       Must hear the tidings as they roll--   Where darkness, death and sorrow reign,       And tyranny has long controlled.    Listen, ye islands of the sea--       For every isle shall hear the sound:   Nations and tongues before unknown,       Though long since lost, shall soon be found.    And then again shall Asia hear,       Where angels first the news proclaimed:   Eternity shall record bear,       And earth repeat the loud, Amen.    The nations catch the pleasing sound,       And Jew and Gentile swell the strain,   Hosanna o'er the earth resound,       Messiah then will come to reign.    FAREWELL.    Farewell, my kind and faithful friend--       The partner of my early youth,   While from my home my steps I bend,       To warn mankind and teach the truth.    How oft in silent evening mild,       I to some lonely place retire--   Thy love and kindness call to mind,       Then lift a voice in humble prayer.    O Lord, extend thine arms of love,       Around the partner of my heart,   For thou hast spoken from above,       And called me with my all to part.    Preserve her soul in perfect peace,       From sickness, sorrow and distress,   Until our pilgrimage shall cease.       And we on Zion's hill shall rest.    How gladly would my soul retire       With thee, to spend a peaceful life,   In some sequestered humble vale,       Far from the scenes of noise and strife.    Where men should grieve our souls no more,       Nor rage of sin disturb our peace;   Our troubles, toils and sufferings o'er,       Their lies and persecutions cease.  PART SECOND.    But lo! the harvest wide extends--       The fields are white o'er all the plain--   The tares in bundles must be bound,       While we with care secure the grain.    Shall we repine when Jesus calls,       Or count the sacrifice too great,   To spend our lives as pilgrims here,       Or loose them for the gospel's sake?    When Jesus Christ has done the same,       Without a place to lay his head,   A pilgrim on the earth he came,       Until for us his blood was shed.    Shall we behold the nations doomed       To sword and famine, blood and fire,   Yet not the least exertion make,       But from the scene in peace retire?    No; while his love for me extends,       The pattern makes my duty plain--   I'll sound to earth's remotest ends,       His gospel to the sons of men!    Farewell, my kind and faithful friend,       Until we meet on earth again--   For soon our pilgrimage shall end,       And the Messiah come to reign.    REFLECTIONS.  IN PRISON, APRIL, 1839.    O freedom, must thy spirit now withdraw   From earth, returning to its native heaven,   There to dwell, till armed with sevenfold vengeance   It comes again to earth with king Messiah,   And all his marshalled hosts in glory bright,   To tread the winepress of Almighty God,   And none escape?--ye powers of heaven forbid;--   Let freedom linger still on shores of time,   And in the breasts of thine afflicted saints,   Let freedom find a peaceful retirement,--   A place of rest;--till o'er the troubled earth--   Mercy, justice, and eternal truth,   While"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60077"],["title","The Millennium, and Other Poems (#5)"],["body","hand in hand to exalt the humble   And debase the proud, shall find some nation   Poor, oppressed, afflicted and despised,   Cast out and trodden under foot of tyrants   Proud, the hiss, the bye-word, and the scorn of knaves:--   And there let freedom's spirit wide prevail.   And grow, and flourish--'mid the humble poor,   Exhalted and enriched by virtue,   Knowledge, temperance, and love--till o'er the earth   Messiah comes to reign;--the proud consumed.   No more oppress the poor.--   Let Freedom's eagle then, (forthcoming, like   The Dove from Noah's Ark) on lofty pinions soar,   And spread its wide domain from end to end,   O'er all the vast expanse of this wide earth,--   While freedom's Temple rears its lofty spires   Amid the skies, and on its bosom rests!   A cloud by day and flaming fire by night!!       But stay, my spirit, though thou feign would'st soar   On high; mid scenes of glory, peace and joy;   From bondage free, and bid thy jail farewell:--   Stop,--wait awhile,--let patience have her perfect work,   Return again to suffering scenes through which   The way to glory lies; and speak of things   Around thee,--thou art in prison still.       But spring has now returned, the wintry blasts   Have ceased to howl through my prison crevices.       The soft and gentle breezes of the south   Are whistling gayly past; and incense sweet   On zephyr's wing, with fragrance fills the air,   Wafted from blooming flowrets of the spring;   While round my lonely dungeon oft is heard   Melodious strains as if the birds of spring   In anthems sweet conspired to pity and   Console the drooping spirits there confined.       All things around me show that days, and weeks,   And months have fled, although to me not mark'd   By sabbaths--and but faintly mark'd by dim   And sombre rays of light alternate mid   The gloom of overhanging night which still   Pervades my drear and solitary cell.   Where now those helpless ones I left to mourn?   Have they perished? no.--what then!--has some   Elijah call'd and found them in the last   Extreme, and multiplied their meal and oil?   Yes, verily,--the Lord has fill'd the hearts   Of his poor saints with everlasting love,   Which, in proportion to their poverty,   Increased with each increasing want, till all   Reduced unto the widow's mite and then   Like her, their living they put in, and thus   O'erflowed the treasury of the Lord with more   Abundant stores than all the wealth of kings.   And thus supported, fed, and clothed; and moved   From scenes of sorrow to a land of peace--   They live!--and living still they do rejoice   In tribulation deep:   Well knowing their redemption draweth nigh!    THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.  WRITTEN IN PRISON.    Boast not, O proud Niagara! although   Thou mayest withstand the ravages of time,   While countless millions swept away with all   Their mighty works, are lost in following years:   Yet there is a voice to speak, long and loud!   'Tis Michael's trump, whose mighty blast shall rend   Thy rocks, and bow thy lofty mountains in the dust.   Before whose awful presence thy waters   Blush in retiring modesty; and in   Respectful silence thou shalt stand, and listening,   Wonder and admire, while thunders roll   Majestic round the sky;--the lightnings play,--   The mountains sink,--the valleys rise,--till earth,   Restored to its original--receives   Its final rest, and groans and sighs no more.   Till then weep on, and let thy voice ascend,   In solemn music to the skies;--it is   A funeral dirge,--thou weepest o'er the miseries   Of a fallen world--in anguish deep.    SPRING.  WRITTEN IN PRISON, APRIL, 1839.    See nature bursting into life and bloom:   Joyous, it rises from its wintry tomb,   Decked in pure robes of purple, white, or green:   Perfumed with incense sweet--O lovely scene!   Melodious sounds, with music soft and sweet,   Thrill through the air--thy joyous presence greet.   Behold, O Mary! and remember too,   There is a spring to bloom for me and you;--   We, like the spring, shall burst the sullen gloom.   All clothed in white--eternally to bloom.   We too, will join the choir his praise to sing,   And hail the welcome of Eternal Spring.    SIGNS OF THE TIMES.  WRITTEN IN PRISON.    Lift up your heads, ye scattered saints,       Redemption draweth nigh;   Our Saviour hears the orphans' plaints';       The widow's mournful cry.    The blood of those who have been slain       For vengeance cries aloud:   Nor shall its cries ascend in vain,       For vengeance on the proud.    The signs in heaven and earth appear;       And blood, and smoke, and fire;   Men's hearts are failing them for fear;       Redemption's drawing nigher.    Earthquakes are bellowing 'neath the ground,       And tempests through the air;--   The trumpet's blast with fearful sound,       Proclaims the alarm of war.    The saints are scattered to and fro,       Through all the earth abroad;   The gospel trump again to blow,       And then behold their God.    Rejoice, ye servants of our God,       Who to the end endure;   Rejoice, for great is your reward,       And your defence is sure.    Although this body should be slain       By cruel, wicked hands;   I'll praise my God in higher strains,       And on Mount Zion stand.    Glory to God, ye saints rejoice,       And sigh and groan no more;   But listen to the spirit's voice;       Redemption's at the door.    BIRTHDAY  IN PRISON, APRIL 12, 1839.    This is the day that gave me birth       In eighteen hundred seven;   From worlds unseen I came to earth,       Far from my native heaven.    Thirty and two long years have pass'd,       To grief and sorrow given;   And now to crown my woes at last       I am confined in prison.    'Tis not for crimes that I have done       That to my foes I'm given,   But to the world I am unknown,       And my reward's in heaven.    What troubled scenes may yet ensue       To strew my path with sorrow,   Is not for me to know, 'tis true,       I boast not of to-morrow.    One thing is sure, this life at best       Is like a troubled ocean;   I often wish myself at rest       From all its dire commotion.    But let its troubled bosom heave,       Its surges beat around me;   To truth, eternal truth, I cleave,       Its floods can never drown me.    ZION IN CAPTIVITY.  A LAMENTATION.  WRITTEN IN PRISON.    Torn from our friends and captive led,       'Mid armed legions bound in chains,   That peace for which our fathers bled       Is gone, and dire confusion reigns.    Zion, our peaceful happy home,       Where oft we joined in praise and prayer,   A desolation has become,       And grief and sorrow linger there.    Her virgins sigh, her widows mourn,       Her children for their parents weep;   In chains her priests and prophets groan,       While some in deaths cold arms do sleep.    Exultingly her savage foes       Now ravage, steal and plunder, where   A virgin's, tears, a widow's woes,       Became their song of triumph there.    How long, O Lord, wilt thou forsake       The saints who tremble at thy word?   Awake, O arm of God, awake--       And teach the nations thou art God.    Descend with all thy holy throng,       The year of thy redeem'd bring near;   Haste--haste the day of vengeance on--       Bid Zion's children dry their tears.    Deliver, Lord, thy captive saints,       And comfort those who long have mourn'd;   Bid Zion cease her dire complaints,       And all creation cease to groan.    OUR COUNTRY.  AN EXTRACT.  WRITTEN IN PRISON.    Here nature too, her grandest works display;   Sublimest themes inspire the Poet's lays,   As if creative power in skill progressed,   As onward still it moved towards the west.    Till here it finished with a master hand   Its mightiest works--to excel all other lands.   In awful majesty our mountains rise,   O'erlook the clouds, and tower amid the skies,   Their lofty summits bid defiance bold,   They fear no rival heights in older worlds.    'Tis true Himmaleh, (Asia's highest peak,)   Has dared with Chimborazo to compete;   But then our rocky summits--scarce explored   Some nameless rival heights may yet afford;   Whose towering pride shall seize the starry crown,   And cast Himmaleh, humbled, to the ground.    Our proud volcanoes, belching forth their flames,   With smoke and lava, overwhelm the plains;   Their lightnings play--their awful thunders roar,   Convulse the earth and sea from shore to shore.   Among them Cotopaxi's awful voice   Would silence Etna,--drown Vesuvius' noise;   While Europe wondering listens to admire   The power superior of Columbia's fires.    Our lakes, like inland seas expanding wide,   Have not a parallel on earth beside.   Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan,   And vast Superior form the mighty plan,   Their waves like oceans wash the verdant shore,   In western wilds too boundless to explore.    Can Europe, Africa, or Asia boast   A lake compared with these in all their coasts?   Our rivers too, pursue their lengthened way,   From far off mountains to the distant sea,   Through fertile vales,--the flowery meads along,   And chiming still their gently murmuring song;   Receiving grateful tribute as they run.   From thousand streams all mingling into one.    Lo! wild Missouri's waters have their source   In unknown regions to the west and north,   From limpid lakes or from the mountain snows,   From thousand springing streams its current flows;   Mid vast prairies, winds its lengthened way,   Two thousand miles where savage hunters stray,   Then quits its wildly wanderings to receive   The busy hum of commerce on its wave.    Two thousand more its rapid current flows,   Receiving still large rivers as it goes,   Young Empires flourish all along its tide,   And joyous cities rise on every side.   What is the boasted Nile compared with this?   Its magnitude is lost in nothingness,    Asia and Europe's longest, proudest streams   'Longside Missouri's tide how short they seem!   Our cataracts too,"]]]
