Bernice had more and grander ones, but the two D's were entirely satisfied, and watched the packing of their small trunks with joyful contentment.  Dolly put in her diary, declaring she should write a full account of each day's happenings.  \"Then that'll do for me,\" said Dotty. \"I hate to keep a diary, and what would be the use? It would be exactly like yours, Doll, and I can borrow yours to read to my people after you've read it to your family.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Dolly, good-naturedly, for what pleased one girl usually suited the other.  They didn't take their schoolbooks, for it made a heavy load, and too, all agreed that it would spoil the pleasant vacation. The girls promised to make up the lessons on their return, and so it seemed as if nothing marred the anticipation of their splendid holiday.     CHAPTER III  THE ARRIVAL   The girls were put on the train at Berwick and as Mrs. Berry was to meet them at the station in New York, they were allowed to make the trip alone.  \"I think this train ride the best part of the whole thing,\" said Dolly, as she took off her coat and hung it up beside her chair. \"I do love to ride in a parlour car; I wish we were to travel in it for a week.\"  \"I like it, too,\" agreed Bernice. \"Oh, girls, what fun we're going to have! You won't like Uncle Jeff at first, he's awful queer; but there's one thing sure, he'll let us do just as we like. He's very good-natured.\"  \"What's Mrs. Berry like?\" asked Dotty. \"I suppose we'll obey her?\"  \"Yes, but she's good-natured, too. I can twist her round my finger. Oh, we'll have a high old time.\"  \"S'pose Mrs. Berry shouldn't be there to meet us when we get in,\" suggested Dolly. \"What then?\"  \"She will, of course,\" said Bernice. \"But if she shouldn't, if the car broke down or anything like that, we'd take a taxicab right to the house.\"  This sounded very grown-up and grand to the two D's, who had had little experience with taxicabs, and Dotty exclaimed with glee, \"I'd rather do that than go in Mr. Forbes' car! What a lark it would be! Oh, Bernice, can we go somewhere in a taxicab while we're there?\"  \"I don't know, Dotty,--I s'pose so. But why should we? Uncle Jeff has two cars, and the chauffeur will take us wherever we want to go.\"  \"But I've never been in a taxicab,--without older people, I mean, and I'd love to try it.\"  \"Well, I expect you can,\" returned Bernice, carelessly. \"I dare say you can do pretty much anything you want to.\"  \"But do behave yourself, Dot,\" cautioned Dolly; \"you're so daring and venturesome, I don't know what mischief you'll get into!\"  \"Oh, we won't get into mischief,\" laughed Bernice. \"There'll be enough fun, without doing anything we oughtn't to.\"  \"Of course, I won't do anything wrong,\" declared Dotty, indignantly. \"But there are so many things to do, it sets me crazy to think of it!\"  \"I'm going to buy things,\" announced Bernice. \"There aren't any decent shops in Berwick, and I'm going to get lots of things in the city stores.\"  \"We can't do that,\" said Dolly, decidedly. \"We haven't lots of money like you have, Bernie; I'm going to see things. I want to see all the pictures I possibly can. I love to look at pictures.\"  \"I want to go to the theatre,\" and Dotty looked at Bernice inquiringly. \"Will we, do you s'pose?\"  \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Berry will take us. Perhaps we can go to matinees, alone.\"  \"I don't think we ought to do that,\" and Dolly looked distinctly disapproving.  \"Oh, come now, old priggy-wig,\" said Dotty, \"don't be too awfully 'fraidcat!\"  \"It will be just as Mrs. Berry says,\" Bernice informed them. \"Father said I must obey her in everything. Uncle Jeff won't pay much attention to what we do, but Mrs. Berry will. I wonder if Alicia will be there when we get there.\"  But Alicia wasn't. As the girls came up the stairs into the great station, they saw a smiling, motherly-looking lady waiting to welcome them.  \"Here you are!\" she cried, and it wasn't necessary for Bernice to introduce her friends, except to tell which was which.  \"I feel as if I knew you,\" Mrs. Berry said, and her kindly grey eyes beamed at them both. \"Now I must learn to tell you apart. Dolly with golden hair,--Dotty with black. Is that it?\"  \"Is Alicia here?\" asked Bernice, eagerly.  \"No; she's coming in at the other station. She won't arrive for an hour or more. Where are your checks? Let George take them.\"  The footman took the checks and looked after them, while Mrs. Berry piloted the girls to the waiting motor-car.  It was a large and very beautiful limousine, and they all got in, and were soon rolling up Fifth Avenue.  \"How splendid it all is!\" exclaimed Dolly, looking out at the crowds. \"It seems as if we must get all snarled up in the traffic, but we don't.\"  \"Kirke is a very careful driver,\" said Mrs. Berry, \"and he understands just where to go. How you've grown, Bernice. I haven't seen you for two years, you know.\"  \"Yes, I have. We're all getting to be grown-ups, Mrs. Berry. Isn't Alicia?\"  \"I don't know. I haven't seen her for a long time. But she's at a very fashionable school, so I suppose she is full of notions.\"  \"What are notions?\" asked Dolly, smiling up into the speaker's eyes.  \"Oh, notions,\" and Mrs. Berry laughed, \"well, it's thinking you know it all yourself, and not being willing to listen to advice. I don't believe you have notions, Dolly.\"  \"No, she hasn't,\" said Bernice. \"But Dotty and I have! However, I promised Dad I'd obey you, Mrs. Berry, in everything you say, so I don't believe you'll have any trouble with us.\"  \"Land, no! I don't expect any. Now, let me see; I've two big rooms for you all, with two beds in each. I suppose you'll room with your cousin, Bernice, and these other two girls together?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dolly, quickly, for she had no idea of rooming with any one but Dotty.  \"That settles itself, then.\"  \"But suppose I don't like Alicia,\" said Bernice, doubtfully. \"Suppose we quarrel.\"  \"All right,\" and Mrs. Berry nodded her head, \"there are other rooms. I don't want you to be uncomfortable in any particular. I thought you'd like it better that way. The two rooms I've fixed for you, are two big ones on the second floor. Mine is on the same floor, in the rear. Your uncle's rooms are upon the third floor.\"  \"I think it sounds fine,\" declared Bernice, \"and I'm sure I'll get on with Alicia, if she does have 'notions.'\"  And then they reached the big house on upper Fifth Avenue, and as they entered, Dolly felt a little appalled at the grandeur everywhere about her. Not so Dotty. She loved elegance, and as her feet sank into the deep soft rugs, she laughed out in sheer delight of being in such beautiful surroundings. Mrs. Berry took the girls at once to their rooms, and sent the car for Alicia.  \"I'll give the front room to Dotty and Dolly,\" she said to Bernice; \"and you can have the other. It's quite as nice, only it looks out on the side street, not on the Avenue.\"  \"That's right, Mrs. Berry. Dot and Dolly are more company than Alicia and I are. We're really members of the family. I was so surprised at Uncle Jeff's inviting us. Why did he do it, anyway?\"  \"Why, indeed!\" said Mrs. Berry, but her expression was quizzical. \"No one can tell why Mr. Forbes does things! He is a law unto himself. Now, girls, your trunks are coming up. And here are two maids to unpack for you and put your things away. You can direct them.\"  Mrs. Berry bustled away, and two neat-looking maids appeared, one of whom entered Bernice's room and the other attended on Dot and Dolly.  \"Which frocks shall I leave out for dinner?\" the maid asked, as she shook out and hung up the dresses in the wardrobe.  \"The blue voile for me,\" replied Dolly, \"and--er--what is your name?\"  \"Foster, miss,\" and she smiled at Dolly's gentle face.  \"And the rose-coloured voile for me,\" directed Dotty. \"You'll find, Foster, that our frocks are pretty much alike except as to colour.\"  \"Yes, ma'am. And these patent leather pumps, I daresay?\"  \"Yes, that's right,\" and Dotty flung herself into a big easy-chair and sighed in an ecstasy of delight that she really had a ladies' maid to wait on her. Dolly didn't take it so easily. She wanted to look after her own things, as she did at home. But Dotty motioned to her not to do so, lest Foster should think them inexperienced or countrified.  Their simple belongings were soon in place, and the two D's wandered into Bernice's room.  Here everything was helter-skelter. Finery was piled on beds and chairs, and hats were flung on top of one another, while shoes and veils, gloves and hair-brushes were scattered on the floor.  \"It's my fault,\" laughed Bernice, \"don't blame Perkins for it! I'm hunting for a bracelet, that has slipped out of my jewel case, somehow. It must be in this lot of stockings!\"  It wasn't, but it turned up at last, inside of a hat, and Bernice gave a little squeal of relief.  \"That's all right, then!\" she cried; \"I wouldn't lose that for worlds! It's a bangle father gave me for Christmas, and it has a diamond in the pendant. All right, Perkins, put the things away any place you like. But save hooks and shelves enough for my cousin Alicia. She'll be in this room with me.\"  Each large room had what seemed to the two little women ample room for clothes. But Bernice had brought so much more than they did, that her things overflowed the space provided.  \"I'll wear this to-night, for dinner,\" she said, pulling out a light green silk from a pile of frocks.  \"Oh, Bernie!\" exclaimed Dotty; \"not that! That's a party dress, isn't it?\"  \"Not exactly. I've more dressy ones. But it is a little fussy for a quiet evening at home, I suppose. Well, what shall I wear?\"  \"This?\" and Dotty picked out a simple challie.  \"Oh, gracious, no! That's a morning frock. I guess I'll stick to the green. Don't you think so, Perkins?\"  \"Yes, miss. It's a lovely gown.\" The maid was interested in the girls, her life in the quiet house being usually most uneventful. This sudden invasion of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5893"],["title","Two Little Women on a Holiday (#4)"],["body","people was welcomed by all the servants, and there were many in Jefferson Forbes' palatial home. Mrs. Berry had engaged several extra ones to help with the increased work, but the two maids assigned to the girls were trusted and tried retainers.  And then, there was a bustle heard downstairs, a peal of laughter and a perfect flood of chatter in a high, shrill voice, and with a bounding run up the staircase, Alicia burst into the room where the three girls were.  \"Hello, Bernice, old girl!\" she shouted, and flung her arms around her cousin's neck, giving her resounding smacks on her cheek. \"Golly! Molly! Polly! but I'm glad to see you again! Forgotten me, have you? Take a good look! Your long lost Alicia! 'Tis really she! And look who's here! I'll bet a pig these two stammering, blushing young misses are the far-famed Dolly and Dotty, but which is which?\"  \"Guess!\" said Dotty, laughing, as Dolly stood dismayed, and half frightened at this whirlwind of a girl.  \"All right, I'll guess. Lemmesee! Dolly Fayre and Dotty Rose;--you see I know your names. Why, the fair one is Dolly of course, and that leaves Dotty to be you!\"  \"Right!\" cried Dotty, and Alicia flew to her and grabbed her as enthusiastically as she had Bernice.  \"Oh, you chickabiddy!\" she cried. \"I foresee we shall be chums! I love Towhead, too, but I'm a little afraid of her. See her steely blue eyes, even now, fixed on me in utter disapprobation!\"  \"Not at all,\" said Dolly, politely, \"I think you're very nice.\"  The calm demureness of this speech was too much for Alicia, and she went off in peals of laughter.  \"Oh, you're rich!\" she cried; \"simpully rich! WON'T we have fun! I'm 'most afraid I'll love you more'n the other one--the black haired witch.\" And then Dolly was treated to an embrace that ruffled her hair and collar and came near ruffling her temper. For Dolly didn't like such sudden familiarity, but her good manners kept her from showing her annoyance.  \"Oh, you don't fool me!\" cried Alicia; \"I know you think I'm awful! Too rambunctious and all that! But I'm used to it! At school they call me That Awful Alicia! How's that?\"  \"Fine, if you like it--and I believe you do!\" laughed Dolly.  \"Mind reader! I say, Bernice, where am I to put my togs! You've squatted on every available foot of property in this room! I thought it was to be ours together! But every single bed in the room is covered with your rags. I've two trunks of duds, myself.\"  \"Two trunks! Why did you bring so much?\"  \"Had to have it. There's lots of things I carry around with me beside clothes. Why, I've brought a whole chafing-dish outfit.\"  \"Goodness, Alicia,\" exclaimed Bernice, \"do you think Uncle Jeff won't give us enough to eat?\"  \"I take no chances. But it isn't that. It's thusly. Say we're out of an evening, and on returning, are sent straight to beddy-by. How comforting to have the necessary for a little spread of our own! Oh, I've tried it out at school, and I can tell you there's something in it. But, where, ladies and gentlemen, WHERE I ask you, can I put it? Bernice has all the places full.\"  \"Leave it in your trunk,\" suggested Dolly, \"until you want to use it.\"  \"Angel child!\" cried Alicia. \"I knew you had some brain concealed among that mop of yellow silk floss! I'll do that same, and be thankful if my voracious cousin leaves me enough room for a few scant and skimpy clodings!\"  And then, as Perkins unpacked Alicia's trunks and Foster came in to help, the room really seemed incapable of holding all.  \"We'd better get out, Doll,\" said Dotty, laughing, as Alicia deposited an armful of petticoats and dressing jackets in her lap.  \"Oh, don't go! I want you to hold things till I find a place for them. And, say, are your own wardrobes full?\"  \"No!\" cried Dolly. \"Just the thing! Put your overflow in our room, we've less than a dozen dresses between us.\"  \"Goodness gracious me! Oh, you're going to buy a lot in the city,--I see!\"  \"No, we're not,\" said Dolly, who never sailed under false colours; \"we brought all we had, all our best ones. I mean. But we don't have things like you and Bernice.\"  \"You frank little bunch of honesty! Isn't she the darling! All right, neighbours, since you insist, I'll put some seventeen or twenty-four of my Paris confections in your empty cupboards.\"  Of course, Alicia was exaggerating, but she really did take half a dozen frocks into the two D's room, and hung them in outspread fashion right over their best costumes.  \"And, now, since one good turn deserves another,\" she rattled on, \"I'll just toss my extra shoes and slippers into your lowest bureau drawer, and my stockings into the next one. There's plenty of room.\"  So there was, by crowding the contents already there. But Alicia was so quick of motion, and so gay of speech that they couldn't refuse to let her have her way. And, too, it seemed inevitable, for there wasn't room for Alicia's things and Bernie's in the same room, and the D's shelves and bureau drawers showed much vacancy.  \"Now, what do we wear this evening?\" Alicia asked, tossing over her dresses. \"This, let us say?\" She held up a low--necked evening gown of silk tissue.  \"No, you goose,\" said Bernice, decidedly. \"Your respected uncle would think you were crazy! Here, wear this.\"  Bernice picked out one of the least ornate, a pretty Dresden silk, and then the girls all began to dress for dinner.     CHAPTER IV  A MERRY QUARTETTE   \"Ready for dinner, girls?\" sounded a cheery voice, and Mrs. Berry came bustling in. \"Almost, aren't you? Try to remember that Mr. Forbes doesn't like to be kept waiting.\"  \"I'm scared to death,\" said Bernice, frankly. \"I never know what to say to Uncle Jeff, anyway, and being a guest makes it all the harder.\"  \"Pooh! I'm not afraid,\" exclaimed Alicia. \"Leave it to me. I'll engineer the conversation and all you girls need to do is to chip in now and then.\"  Alicia was a tall, fair girl, larger than any of the others. She was plump and jolly-looking, and had a breezy manner that was attractive because of her smiling good-natured face. She laughed a great deal, and seemed to have no lack of self-confidence and self-assurance. Her dress had many fluttering ribbons of vivid pink, and frills of lace of an inexpensive variety.  She led the way downstairs, calling out, \"March on, march on to victory!\" and the others followed.  The four entered the drawing-room, and found there a tall, dignified gentleman, in full evening dress. He had a handsome face, though a trifle stern and forbidding of expression, and his closely trimmed white beard was short and pointed. He had large, dark eyes, which darted from one girl to the other as the quartette appeared.  \"H'm,\" he said, \"this is Bernice; how do you do, my dear? How do you do?\"  \"I'm Alicia,\" announced that spry damsel, gaily, and she caught him by the hand.  \"Yes, and very like your mother, my dear sister. Well, Alicia, if you possess half her fine traits, you'll make a splendid woman. But I doubt if you are very much like her except in appearance. You look to me like a flibbertigibbet,--if you know what that is.\"  \"Yes, and I am one, thank you, Uncle Jeff,\" and Alicia laughed gaily, not at all abashed at her uncle's remark.  \"These are my two friends from Berwick, uncle,\" said Bernice, introducing them. \"Dolly Fayre and Dotty Rose.\"  \"You are welcome, my dears,\" and the courteous old gentleman bowed to them with great dignity. \"I trust you can find amusement and enjoy your visit here. Now, let us dine.\"  Dolly looked curiously at her host, as he stood back, and bowed the girls out of the room, before he followed them, but Dotty was so interested in the surroundings that she gave no second thought to Mr. Forbes, as she passed him.  The dining-room was a marvel of old time grandeur. Nothing was modern, but the heavy black walnut sideboard and chairs spoke of long usage and old time ways.  Mrs. Berry did not appear at the table, and evidently was not expected, as no place was set for her.  Mr. Forbes sat at the head, and two girls at either side. A grave-faced, important looking butler directed the service, and two footmen assisted. Everything was of the best, and wonderfully cooked and served, but Dolly and Dotty could scarcely eat for the novelty and interest of the scene.  \"Come, come, Miss Fayre, eat your terrapin,\" counselled Mr. Forbes, \"it is not so good cold.\"  \"Oh, gracious, Uncle Jeff,\" exclaimed the volatile Alicia, \"don't call those kids Miss! Call 'em Dotty and Dolly, do.\"  \"Can't remember which is which,\" declared her uncle, looking at the two D's. \"I can remember the last names, because the Fayre girl is fair, and the Rose girl is rosy. I shall call them Rosy and Fairy, I think.\"  \"All right, Mr. Forbes,\" and Dolly smiled and dimpled at the pretty conceit.  \"And you two must call me something less formal,\" he said. \"Suppose you call me Uncle Forbes, as you are not really my nieces.\"  This seemed a fine plan and was readily adopted.  \"And now,\" Mr. Forbes went on, \"I don't mind confessing that I've no idea what to do with you girls. By way of entertainment, I mean.\"  \"Oh, Uncle Jeff,\" said Bernice, \"it's enough entertainment just to be here in New York for a week. Why, we will have all we can do to see the shops and the sights--I suppose we can go around sight-seeing?\"  \"Bless my soul, yes. Of course you can. Go where you like. Order the motors whenever you choose. Mrs. Berry will do all you want her to; just tell her your plans. All I ask is that I shan't be troubled with you during the day.\"  \"Why, uncle,\" cried Alicia, \"won't we see you at all in the daytime?\"  \"No. I am a very busy man. I cannot have my work interrupted by a pack of foolish chatterers.\"  \"Whatever did you ask us for?\" Alicia's round face wore a look of surprised inquiry.  \"Never you mind, miss. I had a very good reason for asking you, but one doesn't always tell his reasons. However, I expect to see you every night at the dinner table, and for an hour or so afterward in the"]]]
