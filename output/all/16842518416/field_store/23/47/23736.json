When these Poems were first written, the Author had no intention of compiling them in one volume: they sprang into existence one after another as occasion called them forth, at times and in places, and under circumstances widely varying. Some came forth upon the bank of the far-famed Niagara, and some were the plaintive strains poured from a full heart in the lonely dungeons of Missouri where the Author was confined upwards of eight months during the late persecution; some were poured from the top of the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and others were uttered while wandering over the flowery plains and wide-extended prairies of the west; some were written in crowded halls and thronged cities, and some in the lonely forest; some were the melting strains of joy and admiration in contemplating the approaching dawn of that glorious day which shall crown the earth and its inhabitants with universal peace and rest; and others were produced on the occasion of taking leave of my family, friends, or the great congregation, on a mission to other and distant parts; and some were wrung from a bosom overflowing with grief at the loss of those who were nearest and dearest to my heart, \"The Regeneration and Eternal Duration of Matter,\" in particular was a production in prison, which was more calculated to comfort and console myself and friends when death stared me in the face, than as an argumentative or philosophical production for the instruction of others. At length, the Author was induced to embody the whole in one volume in the hope that perhaps others might find them a source of instruction, edification, and comfort.    CONTENTS.

Introduction--Location of the Ten Tribes--The way prepared--Their return to their own lands--The waters divided--Their return contrasted with their going out of Egypt.    A glorious theme the sacred muse inspires,   Cheers up the soul, and tunes the sounding lyre:   Lights the dark vale of sorrow, pain and wo,   And gives to man a paradise below.   The joyful time, by prophets long foretold,   At length comes rolling on the astonished world:   When God, the second time, should set his hand,   To gather Israel to their promised land.   An ensign to the nations now is reared,   The standard waving, and the way prepared;   Let kings and empires tremble at his word,   The gentle nations all their aid afford.   What though Assyria's captives long and lone,[A]   Have wandered outcasts to the world unknown,   In some far region to the frozen north,   Where pale Borealis sends his meteors forth!!   Where fields of ice unbounded block the road,   To keep intruders from their drear abode;   Where no sweet flowers the dreary landscape cheer,   Nor plenteous harvests crown the passing year?   What though the land where milk and honey flowed,   And peace and plenty crowned their blest abode,   Has by the Gentiles long been trodden down,   And desolation reigned o'er all the ground?   Yet soon the icy mountains down shall flow,   The parched ground in springs of water flow,   The barren desert yield delicious fruit,   Their souls to cheer, their spirits to recruit;   Mountains before them levelled to a plain,   The valleys rise, the ocean cleave in twain,   The crooked straightened, and the rough made plain,   The way prepared, lo, Israel comes again!   The seven streams of Egypt's rolling flood   Shall feel the power and might of Israel's God,   Their waves on heaps, like towering mountains rise,   They cross dry shod, with wonder and surprise.   And thus with joy Assyria's captives come,   In grand procession to their ancient home;   A scene of joy and wonder more sublime   Than all that passed in hardened Pharaoh's time.   When captive Israel raised to heaven their cry,   And Moses came, commissioned from on high,   Poured the ten plagues on Egypt with his rod,   The monarch trembling, owned the power of God,   And filled with envy, rage, and wild dismay,   Thrust Israel forth, and bade them haste away;   Then moved with wild despair that all was lost,   He straight pursued them with his numerous host;   Before them stretched the vast expanded sea,   And mountains, on each side, hedged up the way,   The roar of chariots armed, pressed on their rear   In dread array, and filled their souls with fear:   Till Moses o'er the sea stretched forth his rod,   And cleared a passage through the mighty flood,   And soon, with safety, led his armies through,   But Pharaoh, close behind, did still pursue;   The floods returning with majestic roar,   His armies sunk, o'erwhelmed, to rise no more;   While Israel still pursued their joyous way,   Their God, in fire by night, in cloud by day   Before them moved, majestic to behold!   Until on Sinai's mount the thunder rolled,   And lightnings flaming in one general glare,   While clouds of smoke hung on the darkened air.   Jehovah spake! the trumpet, long and loud,   Earth's whole foundation to the centre bowed.   Israel and Moses quaking stood around,   A sudden trembling seized the solid ground.   Moses, at length, drew near; the law was given,   Of justice, equal weights, and measure even:   And angels' food became their constant bread,   A month on quails their numerous hosts were fed,   The rock was smitten, and a fountain burst,--   Poured forth its cooling stream to quench their thirst.   His angel led them all their journey through;   The nations trembling, fainted at the view;   Their mighty walls fell tumbling to the ground,   Destruction swept the nations, all around.   But lo! a scene more glorious strikes my view   Than Israel ever saw or Egypt knew:   Ten thousand times ten thousand I behold,   Returning home, as prophets long foretold:   Sing, O ye heavens! let earth rejoice again,   And all prepare for king Messiah's reign.  [Footnote A: The Ten Tribes.]  CHAPTER II.  Situation of the Jews, from their dispersion to the present time, and the desolation of their land and city--Their restoration to the Land of Canaan--Rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple.    Lo! Judea's remnants--long dispersed abroad,   Without a prophet, king, or priest of God--   Have wandered exiles from their native home,   To darkness doomed, till their deliverance comes.   Their city, once so glorious to behold,   Their temple, decked with precious stones and gold,   The seat of wisdom, and the light of kings,   Where mighty nations did their tribute bring,   Have long remained in one wide ruin round,   And desolation reigned o'er all the ground.   But comfort ye my people, saith your God;   Proclaim the joyful tidings far abroad:   Thy sins are pardoned, and thy warfare o'er,   Thy sons and daughters now shall grieve no more;   But kings thy nursing fathers shall become;   Their ships, and beasts, and chariots bring thee home.   The Gentiles, in their arms, thy sons return;   Thy daughters on their shoulders shall be borne.   Trees crowned with fruit their fainting souls shall cheer,   Their desert land like Eden shall appear;   Their fields, where desolation long has reigned,   Shall now, be fenced, and tilled, and sowed again;   And flocks and herds, in plenty shall be seen,   O'er all the plains they feed in pastures green.   Thy ruined cities shall in splendor rise,   Thy lofty towers point upwards to the skies;   Thy temple reared, most glorious to behold,   Its courts adorned with precious stones and gold:   All things restored, as prophets long declared,   Thus king Messiah's way shall be prepared.  CHAPTER III.  Situation of the remnant of Joseph from the fall of the Nephites A. D. 400, to the discovery of America by Columbus--Effect upon the natives at first view of European vessels--Kind reception of the Europeans by the natives--War with the Indians and their defeat--Rapid settlement of the eastern shores--The war renewed, subsequent sufferings of the Colonies--They again drive the red man--Their settlements advance to the Ohio and the lakes--Further struggle of the natives, their final submission.    Rise, heavenly muse, and leave those scenes of joy,   Awhile let other climes, thy pen employ,   Extend thy vision, cross the mighty deep,   And o'er Columbia's scenes in anguish weep.   See Joseph's remnants, long in darkness dwell,   Since by their hands a mighty nation fell.[A]   The light which once illumed their happy land,   Where towns and cities did in order stand,   Had slumbered long beneath their mouldering towers.   Their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60077"],["title","The Millennium, and Other Poems (#1)"],["body","landscape, and their shady bowers.   Had long been scenes of cruelty, and blood,   The scourge and wrath of an avenging God:   When lo! a scene of wonder, struck their view;   O'er the vast deep, an object strange and new,   Came gliding swiftly onward to the shore,   Part fish, part fowl, or something to adore;   They gazed, with admiration and delight,   As plainer still the object hove in sight:   Nor little dreamed, the Gentiles were at hand,   To smite and drive them, from their blessed land.   With warmest friendship, they their guests sustain,   Until too late, they find their struggles vain:   Whole fleets and armies, lined their lengthened shore;   With din of armour bright, and cannon's roar;   Their cities burned, and drenched with human gore,   They sunk in ruin, and were known no more.   See Gentile cities on a sudden rise,   Their lofty spires point upward to the skies,   Where late the shades, spread o'er the red man's grave,   A sacred bower in memory of the brave.   See boundless forests still around them spread,   From north to south, an immeasurable shade;   Where mighty chieftains oft the signal gave,   And struggled long, their country for to save.   Tribes rose to vengeance while their councils rung,   And liberty still thundered from their tongues;   Onward they rushed with rage and wild despair,   The midnight war-whoop rent the darkened air;   While terror seized their unsuspecting prey,   And blood of infants marked their dreadful way!   Towns wrapped in flames and women captive led,   Where cruel torture filled their souls with dread.   Once more the Gentile stung with keen revenge;   Pursues the red skin o'er the woodland range,   Till darkened swamps become their wild retreat;   And there prepared, the advancing foe they meet.   With desperation they their cause maintain;   Till many a chieftain fell,--their struggle vain,   Till by superior force o'erpowered they yield,   And leave the pale-face master of the field.   From the St. Lawrence's snow invested wilds,   To Florida, where constant verdure smiles,   Their towns and cities sprinkle all the shore;   The midnight war-whoop there is heard no more.   But as their rapid settlements advance,   To the dark wilds, round Erie's vast expanse,   Or o'er the Alleghanies bend their course,   Where broad Ohio's waters have their source;   The natives roused once more in dread array,   Assert their rights, spread terror and dismay;   Till over-powered again, they take to flight,   And with reluctance yield their lawful right.   But tribes remoter still, with dread surprize,   Alarmed at their approach, vindictive rise,   Renew the conflict with redoubled force,   With dreadful slaughter mark their vengeful course,   Till checked by force superior to their own,   Again they fly discouraged and undone,   Reduced in numbers, give the struggle o'er,   Tamely submit, and seek their rights no more.  [Footnote A: The Nephites.]  CHAPTER IV.  The American Revolution--Its effects upon other nations--French Revolution--Revolution of Greece, Poland, &c--Present prosperity of the United States of America--Present state of the Indians--Indian prayer.    Meantime the Gentiles break their foreign yoke,   While tyrants tremble at the dreadful stroke,   Assert their freedom, gain their liberty,   And to the world proclaim Columbia free.   O'er ocean's wave triumphant in the breeze,   Her banner floats o'er all the distant seas,   Where dire oppression, long with tyrant sway,   Had ruled mankind, and led them far astray.   With admiration seized, the nations all,   Filled with delight Columbia's deeds extol;   And gazing still, they catch the sacred fire,   And love of liberty their souls inspire.   While nations oft in their extended plan;   From slumber wake to claim the rights of man,   Empires o'erturned, and tyrants headlong hurled,   The voice of freedom echoes round the world.   First, France arose, in triumph led the way,   Till love of conquest led them far astray;   And dire ambition seized the helm of state,   Through seas of blood, where millions met their fate:   Till they reluctant give the struggle o'er,   And rest content with rights enjoyed before.   And next the Greeks their ancient spirit caught,   From long oppression roused they bravely fought,   They burst the Moslem chains emerging free,   Through seas of blood obtained their liberty.   Poland in turn received the sacred fire,   Her noble sons for freedom did aspire;   And struggling long at length they bravely fell.   But cease, my muse; the tale forbear to tell,   And turn again unto the favored shore,   Where freedom's genius kindly hovers o'er,   See states and nations joyfully extend,   Their wide domain almost from end to end;   From the far eastern shores of rugged Maine,   To wild Missouri's rich and flowery plains,   The harvest fields with rural plenty crowned;   And flowery gardens flourish all around;   The humble cottage and the lofty dome,   Each crowned with plenty form an equal home   See on her lakes, and on her thousand streams,   Her vessels float impelled by sail or steam.   While busy commerce floats along her seas,   With sails expanded wide before the breeze;   Far o'er the wave her rich produce they bear,   And in return bring every kind of ware,   To clothe her sons, her daughters to array,   In linen fine and silk and purple gay;   Thus peace and plenty crown Columbia's soil,   A rich reward of industry and toil.   Lo! the poor Indian, if he chance to roam   O'er the wide fields he once could call his own;   Where oft in youth he sported in the chace,   Mourning the change, he scarcely knows the place;   With bursting heart his streaming eyes survey   The sacred mound where lies his father's clay.   O'erwhelmed with grief to heaven he lifts his eyes   Before the throne his prayers like incense rise:   Great Spirit of our fathers lend an ear,   Pity the red man--to his cries give ear,   Long hast thou scourged him with thy chastening sore,   When will thy vengeance cease, thy wrath be o'er;   When will the white man's dire ambition cease,   And let our scattered remnants dwell in peace?   Or shall we, (driven to the western shore)   Become extinct and fall to rise no more?   Forbid, great Spirit; make thy mercy known,   Reveal thy truth, thy wandering captives own,   Make bare thine arm of power for our release,   And o'er the earth extend the reign of peace.  CHAPTER V.  Coming forth of the fulness of the Gospel--Restoration of the Indians and their gathering West of the Mississippi, by the present administration in fulfilment of prophecy--Commission and Ministry of the servants of God in the last dispensation--Commencement of the gathering of the Gentile Church--Their persecution and dispersion in fulfilment of prophecy, from which reflections are drawn on the subject of persecution in general--The enduement of the servants of God and their ministry among all nations--The power of God displayed in making bare his arm in the eyes of all nations--They flow to Zion--Possess the land in peace--Build up a holy city no more to be thrown down--The wars, earthquakes, pestilences, famines and signs in heaven above anil earth beneath which are to precede the Millennium--The resurrection of the saints--The coming of Christ with all his saints--The burning of the wicked--The restitution of the earth with all its blessings.    Ye gloomy scenes far hence, intrude no more;   Sublimer themes invite the muse, to soar   In loftier strains, while scenes both strange and new,   Burst on the sight and open to the view.   Lo! from the opening heavens in bright array,   An angel comes, to earth he bends his way,   Reveals to man in power, as at the first,   The fulness of the Gospel long since lost.   See earth obedient from its bosom yield!   The sacred truth it faithfully conceal'd,   The wise confounded startle at the sight,   The proud and haughty tremble with affright;   The hireling priests against the truth engage,   While hell beneath stands trembling filled with rage.   False are their hopes and all their struggles vain,   Their craft must fall and with it all their gain;   The deaf must hear, the meek their joy increase,   The poor be glad and their oppression cease.   See Congress stand in all the power of state,   Destined, like Cyrus, now to change the fate   Of Joseph's scattered remnants! long oppressed,   And bring them home unto a land of rest;   Beyond the Mississippi's rolling flood,   A land before ordained by Israel's God!   Where Zion's city shall in grandeur rise,   And fill the wondering nations with surprise.   From north, and south, and east behold them come   By tens of thousands to their destined home!   From heaven's king commissioned to proclaim   Repentance, and baptism in his name,   His servants to the Gentiles lift their voice,   While tens of thousands in the sound rejoice,   And they to Zion bend their joyful way,   With songs of joy and gladness hail the day.   The priests and people filled with dread surprise,   Alarm'd at their approach vindictive rise,   And lest the power of truth should still prevail,   They think to cause the prophecy to fail.   And if by fire and sword the saints they drive,   While other sects and parties grow and thrive,   As bloody persecution lifts her thong,   All parties cry at once, the saints are wrong;   For if they were the chosen of the Lord,   He would protect them and fulfil his word.   O fools, and slow of heart to understand   The prophecies concerning Zion's land.   Have ye not read the words of them of old?   When wrapt in vision clear they have foretold   The wicked deeds that you of late fulfil'd,   The scenes that have transpired on Zion's hill?   He that is truly wise will search and see,   He that's already blind more blind shall be;   One truth is clear, the ransom'd shall return,   Another is, the wicked shall be burned.   How vain the thoughts that stripes would change the mind,   Convince"]]]
