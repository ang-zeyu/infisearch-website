If persecution were good argument,   Why not the Jews make ancient saints repent?   Paul of all men the hardest to reclaim,   Stoned, whipt, imprisoned, still remained the same;   Ten thousand heretics rejoiced in fire,   While priests for their conversion did aspire.   'Tis true the Romans many converts made,   When they the inquisition call'd to aid,   Perhaps these modern times have made a few,   Who turn'd from saints to join the drunken crew;   But persecution spreads the truth abroad,   Make servants bolder in the cause of God.   Adds to their numbers, twice ten thousand more,   And makes them stronger than they were before.       See men commission'd in Messiah's name,   Wide o'er the earth the joyful news proclaim;   While from on high the spirit's power descends   On all the saints that bow to his commands,   The deaf shall hear, the blind their sight receive,   The dumb shall sing with joy, the dying live,   The lame shall leap, and all mankind behold   Jehovah's arm made bare, like days of old.   While his elect to Zion gather home,   From every tribe and nation see them come.   See o'er the land where desolation reign'd,   The saints in peace, enjoy their rights again.       Rise, crown'd with light, imperial Zion rise,   Prepare to meet the city from the skies,   Let Joseph's remnants at thy gates attend,   Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend,   While Gentile saints thy spacious courts shall throng,   And join their voices in the general song;   No more shall proud oppression drive the hence,   Nor terror come, for God is your defence   Come, gentle muse, suspend the joyful lay,   And o'er the earth let's take a wide survey;   Soft touch the lyre in slow and mournful strains,   And sing of scenes where death and sorrow reign;   See dire commotion seize the nations all,   While blood and war the stoutest hearts appal,   Kingdom on kingdom in confusion hurl'd,   System on system wreck'd throughout the world,   Sect against sect in bloody strife engage,   Man against man in single combat rage,   While widows mourn the loss of husbands slain,   And virgins for their bridegrooms weep in vain,   While pining famine wastes their strength by day,   And pestilence oft seizes on its prey;   Earthquakes in turn in bellowing fury roar,   And ocean's waves roll frightful to the shore.   See through the heavens the sun in sackcloth mourn,   The moon to blood in frowning anger turns,   The stars affrighted from their spheres are hurled,   System on system wreck'd and world on world,   Earth's whole foundation to the centre nods.   And nature trembling feels the power of God.   While Michael sounds the trumpet loud and long,   See from their graves the saints unnumbered throng;   See through the air the ocean and the earth,   Their dust reviving bursting into birth,   See bone to bone in perfect order fly,   While sinews, flesh, and skin their place supply;   And every hair all number'd in its place,   Immortal beauty does their temples grace.   Thus formed anew with joy they mount on high,   And wing their passage to the upper sky;   Meantime the heavens rend while wrapt in fire,   The nations see the glory of Messiah!   With all the saints to earth he bends his way;   In flames descends, who can abide the day?   The great, the rich, the mighty loudly call,   Saying, ye rocks and mountains on us fall.   But fire consumes the wicked, branch and root,   And leaves their ashes trodden under foot.   Behold the Mount of Olives rend in twain,   While on its top he sets his feet again!   The islands at his word obedient flee!   While to the north he rolls the mighty sea!   Restores the earth in one, as at the first,   With all its blessings, and removes the curse.  CHAPTER VI.  The binding of Satan--Pouring out of the spirit upon all flesh--Harmony of all the beasts of the earth, while peace and the knowledge and glory of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea--The faith of Abel the first martyr--Enoch's song--The testimony of many of the holy prophets and apostles--And the general expectation of all the saints in all nations and generations.    Lo! Satan bound in chains shall rage no more,   Nor tempt mankind till thousand years are o'er;   But perfect peace and harmony extend   Their wide domain to earth's remotest ends,   All flesh shall feel the spirit from on high,   The wolf and lamb in peace together lie.   The cow and bear shall feed in pastures green,   While in the shade their young ones shall be seen,   The lion cease to be a beast of prey,   And like the harmless ox shall feed on hay;   The little child secure from harm shall stray   O'er poisonous serpent's dens shall fearless play;   In all God's holy Mount shall naught destroy,   But men for pruning hooks their spears employ;   Their swords to ploughshares turned, shall till the ground,   While plenteous harvests flourish all around,   And earth o'erwhelm'd with knowledge of the Lord,   Like as the waters fill the mighty flood;   While king Messiah reigns the king of kings,   And saints and angels join his praise to sing.       Hail glorious day, by prophets long foretold;   And sought by holy men from days of old;   Who found it not, but readily confessed,   As pilgrims here, they sought a promised rest.   Hear Abel groan, as first he yields to death,   And is succeeded by his brother Seth;   He dies in faith to wait till Christ appears;   To rise and reign with him a thousand years.   Hear Enoch too, the wondrous scene foretell,   While future glories did his bosom swell;   The vail was rent, while wonders strange and new   Before him rose, and opened to his view.   Long, long he heard the earth in anguish mourn;   Saw heaven weep, while oft his bowels yearn'd;   While all eternity, with pain beheld   The scenes of sorrow which his bosom swell'd:   He saw the Lamb on Calvary expire,   While rocks were rent, and cities wrapt in fire;   He saw him burst the tomb, and mount on high   Enthroned in glory 'mid the upper sky.   Obtain'd the promise, he would come again   To earth, in triumph with his saints to reign;   His soul was glad with joy he tuned the lyre;   And sung the glorious reign of king Messiah.       Hosanna to the Lamb that shall be slain;   All hail the day when Zion comes again;   Out of the earth the truth in power he sends,   While righteousness from heaven shall descend,   And these shall sweep the earth as with a flood,   To gather out the purchase of his blood;   Unto the Zion which he shall prepare;   And Enoch with his city meet them there,   When all the ransom'd saints shall join the lay,   And shout Hosanna in eternal day.   Wide o'er the earth, the Saviour's name extend;   And peace o'er all prevail from end to end.       Thus Enoch sang, while all the heavenly choir;   Join'd in Hosanna to the king Messiah.   Noah too, by faith beheld the scene afar;   And as a type, he did the ark prepare.   Condemned the world, by water overthrown,   While to his view the light triumphant shone,   He gazed with joy on all the glorious scene,   But mourn'd the darkness that should roll between.   Abram with joy beheld the day of rest;   When in his seed all nations should be bless'd,   And gladly wandered as a pilgrim here;   And fell asleep to wait till Christ appears--   In sure and certain hope to rise and reign   In Canaan's land, a right he had obtained.   Isaac and Jacob had the glorious view,   Rejoiced in death and so did Joseph too;   While patient Job in pain look'd far away,   Saw his Redeemer in the latter day,   Stand on the earth, while he himself should rise   And in the flesh behold him with his eyes.   Moses and Joshua, Samuel and Isaiah,   Did each in turn this solemn truth declare;   While David tuned the lyre in joyful lays,   Spake of Messiah's reign, and sung his praise.   Ezekiel, Daniel, Joel, Zachariah,   And Malachi, have spoken of Messiah;   When he should set his feet on earth again,   Burn up the proud, and o'er the nations reign.   Jesus and Peter, John and James, and Paul,   The time would fail me here to mention all;   Who wrapt in vision clear in turn foretold,   The day of wonders I would fain unfold.   Lehi, Nephi, Alma and Mosiah,   Abinedi, who once rejoiced in fire;   Mormon, Moroni and Ether testified;   For this they lived, and in this faith they died;   And all the saints of God in all the earth,   Down from old Adam to the latest birth;   And all the vast creations which extend,   Through boundless space till man can find no end,   And all the heavenly host around the throne,   Shall sound his praise in reverential tone.   Millions unnumber'd at his feet shall fall,   Hail him as king, and crown him Lord of all.    HISTORICAL SKETCH FROM THE CREATION TO THE PRESENT DAY. In Three Parts  PART FIRST.    When earth's foundation first was laid,       The heavens in order stood;   And all the works God's hand had made,       His word pronounced good.    But soon the happy scene was changed,       For man to whom 'twas given,   To choose the way of life or death,       Trangressed the law of heaven.    And thus the evil seed was sown,       And death through all their race;   In which creation long has groaned;       In pain to be released.    'T was then the scene of love began       To be revealed on earth;   By angels borne from heaven to man       The gospel's heavenly birth.    The God of heaven shall send his son,       For man to bleed and die;   And rise again that man may rise,       And reign with him on high.    Repentance and baptism then       By angels were revealed,   The holy ghost descending down,       The heirs of glory seal'd.    Thus men began to exercise       Their faith in Jesus' word,   With joy to embrace the gospel plan,       And call upon the Lord."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60077"],["title","The Millennium, and Other Poems (#3)"],["body","    But many then would not believe,       But soon forgot the Lord;   Soon Enoch rose with mighty power,       Being call'd to preach the word.    He preach'd repentance and baptized,       Through all the happy land,   The people who in Zion dwelt,       Were of one heart and mind.    At length the city was not found,       For God received it up;   The residue were left to drown,       And in the prison shut.    But Noah the Eighth was saved by faith,       When warn'd an ark to build,   And seven of his family,       From whom the earth was fill'd.  PART SECOND.    Again the nations left the Lord       To worship stocks and stones,   Forgot the wonders of the flood,       And sunk in darkness down;    And then again was God reveal'd       To Abram, his friend,   Called him to leave his house and home,       To view a chosen land.    To thee and to thy seed, he said,       I give this blessed land,   Though like the stars for multitude,       And numerous as the sand.    But Abraham died a stranger in       The land 'twas to him given,   Nor owned a place to set his foot,       On it beneath the heaven.    His seed possessed it for a while,       Became a sinful host;   And then ten tribes were led away,       And to our knowledge lost.    From time to time were led away,       Of Israel's chosen seed,   Dispersed o'er islands of the sea,       As all the prophets read.    And thus the ages rolled away,       The appointed time drew near,   As all the prophets had declared       That Christ must soon appear.    John, like a bright and morning star       Rose to prepare his way,   Proclaimed repentance, and baptized       Whoever would obey.    The son of God at length appeared,       And was baptized by John,   The Father sent the spirit down       And owned him for his son.    He to his own the gospel preached,       His own received him not,   Despised all his mighty works,       And counted him as naught.    At length their Lord they crucified,       While nature stood amazed,   The solid rocks in sunder rent,       While Jew and Gentile gazed.    But soon the third bright morn appeared,       When, rising from the dead,   To his disciples he appeared       And thus unto them said:  PART THIRD.    Go ye, and preach in all the world,       Baptizing in my name,   He that believes and is baptized       Salvation shall obtain.    Then rising from Mount Olivet       Unto his Father's throne,   On high to reign until he claims       The kingdoms for his own.    His servants then, in mighty power,       Soon made his gospel known,   The Jews reject while Gentiles come,       And glad their Saviour own.    The Jews dispersed through all the earth,       Jerusalem trodden down,   In desolation long has lain,       And cursed has been the ground.    The Gentile churches for a while       Produced the natural fruit,   Being grafted in the natural vine,       Partaking of the root.    But soon the fruit became corrupt,       By flatteries and lies,   Teachers in pride were puffed up,       The simple truth despised.    Great Babylon at length arose,       In mighty power to reign,   Nations and kings became corrupt,       And many saints were slain.    The scriptures of their plainness robbed,       And mystery thrown around,   That men might sup her golden cup,       And all true knowledge drown.    Thus generations long have passed,       And age on ages rolled,   The latter day approaching fast,       Its glories to unfold.    Our fathers of the Gentile race       Traversed the western main,   And found a wide extended land,       Of valley, hill, and plain.    This land was peopled with a race,       Which long had dwelt alone,   No record nor tradition traced       Their origin unknown.    The Lord in mercy has disclosed       The truth so long concealed,   The record found beneath the ground       Has glorious things revealed.    This is the land which Moses blessed,       To Joseph and his seed;   These are the everlasting hills,       'T was for his bounds decreed.    CHARITY AND TRUE PATRIOTISM.    Behold the man whose tender heart       Expanded with a Saviour's love,   Wide as eternity expands,       His bowels with compassion move.    He looks on Zion from afar,       He hears the captive exiles groan,   Then leaves his wife and children dear,       His brethren and his peaceful home.    And hastens at his Lord's command       To call his brethren from afar,   As volunteers for Zion's land,       That in her sorrows they may share.    He dare assert her injured cause,       And sound the trump of freedom when   They trample on his country's laws,       And disregard both God and man.    His distant brethren hear the sound,       And rise to march to Zion's land;   Behold the armies gathering round       Against the powers of hell to stand.    The little stone begins to roll,       It shall prevail and never cease,   But fill the earth from pole to pole       With freedom, union, love and peace.    THE OPENING OF THE DISPENSATION OF THE FULNESS OF TIMES.    When earth in bondage long had lain,   And darkness o'er the nations reigned,   And all man's precepts proved in vain,   A perfect system to obtain:    A voice commissioned from on high;   Hark, hark, it is the angel's cry,   Descending from the throne of light,   His garments shining clear and white.    He comes the gospel to reveal   In fulness, to the sons of men;   Lo! from Cumorah's lonely hill,   There comes a record of God's will!    Translated by the power of God,   His voice bears record to his word;   Again an angel did appear,   As witnesses do record bear.    Restored the priesthood, long since lost,   In truth and power as at the first,   Thus men commissioned from on high,   Came forth and did repentance cry.    Baptizing those who did believe,   That they the spirit might receive,   In fullness as in days of old,   And have one shepherd and one fold.  SECOND PART.    Ye Gentile nations, cease your strife,   And listen to the words of life;   Turn from your sins with one accord,   Prepare to meet your coming Lord.    Let Judah's remnants far and near   The glorious proclamation hear,   For Israel and the Gentiles too,   The way to Zion shall pursue.    Their voices and their tongues employ   In songs of everlasting joy;   The mountains and the hills rejoice,   Let all creation hear his voice.    From north to south, from east to west,   In thee all nations shall be blessed,   When Abram and his seed shall stand   Unnumbered on the promised land.    CHRIST'S MINISTRY TO THE NEPHITES.    The solid rocks were rent in twain,   When Christ the Lamb of God was slain;   The sun in darkness veiled his face,   The mountains moved and left their place.    And all creation groaned in pain   Till the Messiah rose again;   When earth did cease her dreadful groans,   The sun unveiled his face and shone;    The righteous that were spared alive,   With joy and wonder did believe,   And soon together they convened   Conversing on the things they'd seen:    Which had been given for a sign,   When lo, they heard a voice divine,   And as the heavenly voice they heard   The Lord of glory soon appeared.  SECOND PART.    With joy and wonder all amazed,   Upon their glorious Lord they gazed,   And wist not what the vision meant   But thought it was an angel sent    While in their midst he smiling stood,   Proclaimed himself the son of God,   He said come forth and feel and see,   That you may witness bear of me.    And when they all had felt and seen   Where once the nails and spear had been,   Hosanna they aloud proclaimed,   And blessed and praised his holy name,    He then proceeded to make plain   His gospel to the sons of men,   The prophecies he did unfold,   Yea, things that were in days of old.    And every thing that should transpire   Till element should melt with fire,   Commanding them for to record   The sayings of their risen Lord;    That generation should be blessed,   And with him in his kingdom rest;   But, O! what scenes of sorrow rolled   When he the future did unfold!  PART THIRD.    Four generations should not pass   Until they'd turn from righteousness,   The Nephite nation be destroyed!   The Lamanites reject his word,    The gospel taken from their midst,   The record of their fathers hid,   They dwindle long in unbelief,   And ages pass without relief,    Until the Gentiles from afar,   Should smite them in a dreadful war,   And take possession of their land,   And they should have no power to stand.    But as their remnants wander far,   In darkness, sorrow and despair,   Lo! from the earth their record comes   To gather Israel to their homes.    First to the Gentiles 'tis revealed,   The prophecy must be fulfilled;   That they may know and understand   His gospel, and no more contend.    Hear! O ye Gentiles, and repent,   To you is this salvation sent;   God to the Gentiles lifts his hand,   To gather Israel to their land.    THE NEPHITES, LAMANITES AND GENTILES.    O who that has search'd in the records of old,       And read the last scenes of distress;   Four and twenty were left who with Mormon beheld,       While their nation lay mouldering to dust.    The Nephites destroyed, the Lamanites dwelt,       For ages in sorrow unknown;   Generations have pass'd, till the Gentiles at last,       Have divided their lands as their own.    O, who that has seen o'er the wide spreading plain       The Lamanites wander forlorn,   While the Gentiles in pride and oppression divide       The land they could once call their own.    And who that believes does not long for the hour       When sin and oppression shall cease,   And truth, like the rainbow, display through the shower,       That bright written promise of peace.    O, thou afflicted and sorrowful race,       The days of thy sorrow shall end;   The Lord has pronounced you a remnant of His,       Descended from Abram his friend.    Thy stones with fair colors most glorious shall stand,"]]]
