How are you to find your friend in all the great country that is visible from their rugged flanks?\"  \"Easily,\" I answered him, \"for Ja gave me minute directions.  I recall almost his exact words:  \"'You need merely come to the foot of the highest peak of the Mountains of the Clouds.  There you will find a river that flows into the Lural Az.  \"'Directly opposite the mouth of the river you will see three large islands far out--so far that they are barely discernible.  The one to the extreme left as you face them from the mouth of the river is Anoroc, where I rule the tribe of Anoroc.'\"  And so we hastened onward toward the great cloud-mass that was to be our guide for several weary marches.  At last we came close to the towering crags, Alp-like in their grandeur.  Rising nobly among its noble fellows, one stupendous peak reared its giant head thousands of feet above the others.  It was he whom we sought; but at its foot no river wound down toward any sea.  \"It must rise from the opposite side,\" suggested Perry, casting a rueful glance at the forbidding heights that barred our further progress.  \"We cannot endure the arctic cold of those high flung passes, and to traverse the endless miles about this interminable range might require a year or more.  The land we seek must lie upon the opposite side of the mountains.\"  \"Then we must cross them,\" I insisted.  Perry shrugged.  \"We can't do it, David,\" he repeated. \"We are dressed for the tropics. We should freeze to death among the snows and glaciers long before we had discovered a pass to the opposite side.\"  \"We must cross them,\" I reiterated.  \"We will cross them.\"  I had a plan, and that plan we carried out.  It took some time.  First we made a permanent camp part way up the slopes where there was good water.  Then we set out in search of the great, shaggy cave bear of the higher altitudes.  He is a mighty animal--a terrible animal.  He is but little larger than his cousin of the lesser, lower hills; but he makes up for it in the awfulness of his ferocity and in the length and thickness of his shaggy coat.  It was his coat that we were after.  We came upon him quite unexpectedly.  I was trudging in advance along a rocky trail worn smooth by the padded feet of countless ages of wild beasts.  At a shoulder of the mountain around which the path ran I came face to face with the Titan.  I was going up for a fur coat.  He was coming down for breakfast.  Each realized that here was the very thing he sought.  With a horrid roar the beast charged me.  At my right the cliff rose straight upward for thousands of feet.  At my left it dropped into a dim, abysmal canyon.  In front of me was the bear.  Behind me was Perry.  I shouted to him in warning, and then I raised my rifle and fired into the broad breast of the creature.  There was no time to take aim; the thing was too close upon me.  But that my bullet took effect was evident from the howl of rage and pain that broke from the frothing jowls.  It didn't stop him, though.  I fired again, and then he was upon me.  Down I went beneath his ton of maddened, clawing flesh and bone and sinew.  I thought my time had come.  I remember feeling sorry for poor old Perry, left all alone in this inhospitable, savage world.  And then of a sudden I realized that the bear was gone and that I was quite unharmed.  I leaped to my feet, my rifle still clutched in my hand, and looked about for my antagonist.  I thought that I should find him farther down the trail, probably finishing Perry, and so I leaped in the direction I supposed him to be, to find Perry perched upon a projecting rock several feet above the trail.  My cry of warning had given him time to reach this point of safety.  There he squatted, his eyes wide and his mouth ajar, the picture of abject terror and consternation.  \"Where is he?\" he cried when he saw me.  \"Where is he?\"  \"Didn't he come this way?\" I asked.  \"Nothing came this way,\" replied the old man.  \"But I heard his roars--he must have been as large as an elephant.\"  \"He was,\" I admitted; \"but where in the world do you suppose he disappeared to?\"  Then came a possible explanation to my mind.  I returned to the point at which the bear had hurled me down and peered over the edge of the cliff into the abyss below.  Far, far down I saw a small brown blotch near the bottom of the canon. It was the bear.  My second shot must have killed him, and so his dead body, after hurling me to the path, had toppled over into the abyss.  I shivered at the thought of how close I, too, must have been to going over with him.  It took us a long time to reach the carcass, and arduous labor to remove the great pelt.  But at last the thing was accomplished, and we returned to camp dragging the heavy trophy behind us.  Here we devoted another considerable period to scraping and curing it. When this was done to our satisfaction we made heavy boots, trousers, and coats of the shaggy skin, turning the fur in.  From the scraps we fashioned caps that came down around our ears, with flaps that fell about our shoulders and breasts.  We were now fairly well equipped for our search for a pass to the opposite side of the Mountains of the Clouds.  Our first step now was to move our camp upward to the very edge of the perpetual snows which cap this lofty range.  Here we built a snug, secure little hut, which we provisioned and stored with fuel for its diminutive fireplace.  With our hut as a base we sallied forth in search of a pass across the range.  Our every move was carefully noted upon our maps which we now kept in duplicate.  By this means we were saved tedious and unnecessary retracing of ways already explored.  Systematically we worked upward in both directions from our base, and when we had at last discovered what seemed might prove a feasible pass we moved our belongings to a new hut farther up.  It was hard work--cold, bitter, cruel work.  Not a step did we take in advance but the grim reaper strode silently in our tracks.  There were the great cave bears in the timber, and gaunt, lean wolves--huge creatures twice the size of our Canadian timber-wolves. Farther up we were assailed by enormous white bears--hungry, devilish fellows, who came roaring across the rough glacier tops at the first glimpse of us, or stalked us stealthily by scent when they had not yet seen us.  It is one of the peculiarities of life within Pellucidar that man is more often the hunted than the hunter.  Myriad are the huge-bellied carnivora of this primitive world.  Never, from birth to death, are those great bellies sufficiently filled, so always are their mighty owners prowling about in search of meat.  Terribly armed for battle as they are, man presents to them in his primal state an easy prey, slow of foot, puny of strength, ill-equipped by nature with natural weapons of defense.  The bears looked upon us as easy meat.  Only our heavy rifles saved us from prompt extinction.  Poor Perry never was a raging lion at heart, and I am convinced that the terrors of that awful period must have caused him poignant mental anguish.  When we were abroad pushing our trail farther and farther toward the distant break which, we assumed, marked a feasible way across the range, we never knew at what second some great engine of clawed and fanged destruction might rush upon us from behind, or lie in wait for us beyond an ice-hummock or a jutting shoulder of the craggy steeps.  The roar of our rifles was constantly shattering the world-old silence of stupendous canons upon which the eye of man had never before gazed. And when in the comparative safety of our hut we lay down to sleep the great beasts roared and fought without the walls, clawed and battered at the door, or rushed their colossal frames headlong against the hut's sides until it rocked and trembled to the impact.  Yes, it was a gay life.  Perry had got to taking stock of our ammunition each time we returned to the hut.  It became something of an obsession with him.  He'd count our cartridges one by one and then try to figure how long it would be before the last was expended and we must either remain in the hut until we starved to death or venture forth, empty, to fill the belly of some hungry bear.  I must admit that I, too, felt worried, for our progress was indeed snail-like, and our ammunition could not last forever.  In discussing the problem, finally we came to the decision to burn our bridges behind us and make one last supreme effort to cross the divide.  It would mean that we must go without sleep for a long period, and with the further chance that when the time came that sleep could no longer be denied we might still be high in the frozen regions of perpetual snow and ice, where sleep would mean certain death, exposed as we would be to the attacks of wild beasts and without shelter from the hideous cold.  But we decided that we must take these chances and so at last we set forth from our hut for the last time, carrying such necessities as we felt we could least afford to do without.  The bears seemed unusually troublesome and determined that time, and as we clambered slowly upward beyond the highest point to which we had previously attained, the cold became infinitely more intense.  Presently, with two great bears dogging our footsteps we entered a dense fog.  We had reached the heights that are so often cloud-wrapped for long periods.  We could see nothing a few paces beyond our noses.  We dared not turn back into the teeth of the bears which we could hear grunting behind us.  To meet them in this bewildering fog would have been to court instant death.  Perry was almost overcome by the hopelessness of our situation.  He flopped down on his knees and began to pray.  It was the first time I had heard him at his old habit since my return to Pellucidar, and I had thought that he had given up his little idiosyncrasy; but he hadn't.  Far from it.  I let him pray for a short time undisturbed, and then as I was about"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/605"],["title","Pellucidar (#5)"],["body"," suggest that we had better be pushing along one of the bears in our rear let out a roar that made the earth fairly tremble beneath our feet.  It brought Perry to his feet as if he had been stung by a wasp, and sent him racing ahead through the blinding fog at a gait that I knew must soon end in disaster were it not checked.  Crevasses in the glacier-ice were far too frequent to permit of reckless speed even in a clear atmosphere, and then there were hideous precipices along the edges of which our way often led us.  I shivered as I thought of the poor old fellow's peril.  At the top of my lungs I called to him to stop, but he did not answer me.  And then I hurried on in the direction he had gone, faster by far than safety dictated.  For a while I thought I heard him ahead of me, but at last, though I paused often to listen and to call to him, I heard nothing more, not even the grunting of the bears that had been behind us.  All was deathly silence--the silence of the tomb.  About me lay the thick, impenetrable fog.  I was alone.  Perry was gone--gone forever, I had not the slightest doubt.  Somewhere near by lay the mouth of a treacherous fissure, and far down at its icy bottom lay all that was mortal of my old friend, Abner Perry.  There would his body be preserved in its icy sepulcher for countless ages, until on some far distant day the slow-moving river of ice had wound its snail-like way down to the warmer level, there to disgorge its grisly evidence of grim tragedy, and what in that far future age, might mean baffling mystery.    CHAPTER III  SHOOTING THE CHUTES--AND AFTER  Through the fog I felt my way along by means of my compass.  I no longer heard the bears, nor did I encounter one within the fog.  Experience has since taught me that these great beasts are as terror-stricken by this phenomenon as a landsman by a fog at sea, and that no sooner does a fog envelop them than they make the best of their way to lower levels and a clear atmosphere.  It was well for me that this was true.  I felt very sad and lonely as I crawled along the difficult footing. My own predicament weighed less heavily upon me than the loss of Perry, for I loved the old fellow.  That I should ever win the opposite slopes of the range I began to doubt, for though I am naturally sanguine, I imagine that the bereavement which had befallen me had cast such a gloom over my spirits that I could see no slightest ray of hope for the future.  Then, too, the blighting, gray oblivion of the cold, damp clouds through which I wandered was distressing.  Hope thrives best in sunlight, and I am sure that it does not thrive at all in a fog.  But the instinct of self-preservation is stronger than hope.  It thrives, fortunately, upon nothing.  It takes root upon the brink of the grave, and blossoms in the jaws of death.  Now it flourished bravely upon the breast of dead hope, and urged me onward and upward in a stern endeavor to justify its existence.  As I advanced the fog became denser.  I could see nothing beyond my nose.  Even the snow and ice I trod were invisible.  I could not see below the breast of my bearskin coat.  I seemed to be floating in a sea of vapor.  To go forward over a dangerous glacier under such conditions was little short of madness; but I could not have stopped going had I known positively that death lay two paces before my nose.  In the first place, it was too cold to stop, and in the second, I should have gone mad but for the excitement of the perils that beset each forward step.  For some time the ground had been rougher and steeper, until I had been forced to scale a considerable height that had carried me from the glacier entirely.  I was sure from my compass that I was following the right general direction, and so I kept on.  Once more the ground was level.  From the wind that blew about me I guessed that I must be upon some exposed peak of ridge.  And then quite suddenly I stepped out into space.  Wildly I turned and clutched at the ground that had slipped from beneath my feet.  Only a smooth, icy surface was there.  I found nothing to clutch or stay my fall, and a moment later so great was my speed that nothing could have stayed me.  As suddenly as I had pitched into space, with equal suddenness did I emerge from the fog, out of which I shot like a projectile from a cannon into clear daylight.  My speed was so great that I could see nothing about me but a blurred and indistinct sheet of smooth and frozen snow, that rushed past me with express-train velocity.  I must have slid downward thousands of feet before the steep incline curved gently on to a broad, smooth, snow-covered plateau.  Across this I hurtled with slowly diminishing velocity, until at last objects about me began to take definite shape.  Far ahead, miles and miles away, I saw a great valley and mighty woods, and beyond these a broad expanse of water.  In the nearer foreground I discerned a small, dark blob of color upon the shimmering whiteness of the snow.  \"A bear,\" thought I, and thanked the instinct that had impelled me to cling tenaciously to my rifle during the moments of my awful tumble.  At the rate I was going it would be but a moment before I should be quite abreast the thing; nor was it long before I came to a sudden stop in soft snow, upon which the sun was shining, not twenty paces from the object of my most immediate apprehension.  It was standing upon its hind legs waiting for me.  As I scrambled to my feet to meet it, I dropped my gun in the snow and doubled up with laughter.  It was Perry.  The expression upon his face, combined with the relief I felt at seeing him again safe and sound, was too much for my overwrought nerves.  \"David!\" he cried.  \"David, my boy! God has been good to an old man. He has answered my prayer.\"  It seems that Perry in his mad flight had plunged over the brink at about the same point as that at which I had stepped over it a short time later.  Chance had done for us what long periods of rational labor had failed to accomplish.  We had crossed the divide.  We were upon the side of the Mountains of the Clouds that we had for so long been attempting to reach.  We looked about.  Below us were green trees and warm jungles.  In the distance was a great sea.  \"The Lural Az,\" I said, pointing toward its blue-green surface.  Somehow--the gods alone can explain it--Perry, too, had clung to his rifle during his mad descent of the icy slope.  For that there was cause for great rejoicing.  Neither of us was worse for his experience, so after shaking the snow from our clothing, we set off at a great rate down toward the warmth and comfort of the forest and the jungle.  The going was easy by comparison with the awful obstacles we had had to encounter upon the opposite side of the divide.  There were beasts, of course, but we came through safely.  Before we halted to eat or rest, we stood beside a little mountain brook beneath the wondrous trees of the primeval forest in an atmosphere of warmth and comfort.  It reminded me of an early June day in the Maine woods.  We fell to work with our short axes and cut enough small trees to build a rude protection from the fiercer beasts.  Then we lay down to sleep.  How long we slept I do not know.  Perry says that inasmuch as there is no means of measuring time within Pellucidar, there can be no such thing as time here, and that we may have slept an outer earthly year, or we may have slept but a second.  But this I know.  We had stuck the ends of some of the saplings into the ground in the building of our shelter, first stripping the leaves and branches from them, and when we awoke we found that many of them had thrust forth sprouts.  Personally, I think that we slept at least a month; but who may say? The sun marked midday when we closed our eyes; it was still in the same position when we opened them; nor had it varied a hair's breadth in the interim.  It is most baffling, this question of elapsed time within Pellucidar.  Anyhow, I was famished when we awoke.  I think that it was the pangs of hunger that awoke me.  Ptarmigan and wild boar fell before my revolver within a dozen moments of my awakening.  Perry soon had a roaring fire blazing by the brink of the little stream.  It was a good and delicious meal we made.  Though we did not eat the entire boar, we made a very large hole in him, while the ptarmigan was but a mouthful.  Having satisfied our hunger, we determined to set forth at once in search of Anoroc and my old friend, Ja the Mezop.  We each thought that by following the little stream downward, we should come upon the large river which Ja had told me emptied into the Lural Az op-posite his island.  We did so; nor were we disappointed, for at last after a pleasant journey--and what journey would not be pleasant after the hardships we had endured among the peaks of the Mountains of the Clouds--we came upon a broad flood that rushed majestically onward in the direction of the great sea we had seen from the snowy slopes of the mountains.  For three long marches we followed the left bank of the growing river, until at last we saw it roll its mighty volume into the vast waters of the sea.  Far out across the rippling ocean we descried three islands. The one to the left must be Anoroc.  At last we had come close to a solution of our problem--the road to Sari.  But how to reach the islands was now the foremost question in our minds.  We must build a canoe.  Perry is a most resourceful man.  He has an axiom which carries the thought-kernel that what man has done, man can do, and it doesn't cut any figure with Perry whether a fellow knows how to do it or not.  He set out to make gunpowder once, shortly after our escape from Phutra and at the beginning of the confederation of the wild tribes of Pellucidar.  He said that some one, without any knowledge of the fact that such a thing might be concocted, had once stumbled upon it by accident, and so he couldn't see why a fellow who knew"]]]
