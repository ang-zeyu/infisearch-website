You shall know what France thinks of the service you have done for her, and -- yes, for your own brothers-in-arms as well.  Listen!  You are already promoted, Monsieur Erwin.  I may tell you that much.  And so is your comrade, Blaine. Look!  He already wears his decoration.\"  \"Oh, well,\" said Orris wearily, \"we didn't do so much after all.  We did our bombing -- what we were sent to do.  Then we somehow had to go down in back of the Boche lines.  While there we took that German machine.  It was right handy, and no trouble.  What else could I do but bring back your Bleriot, leaving Lafe here to do all the work of fetching in that Boche machine and the Boche himself?  Got back all right, did you, Lafe.  Looked to me when that other crowd tackled us as if you might have your hands full.\"  Blaine here smiled, nodded, and playfully rejoined:  \"Looked to me as if you, too, would have some time getting back.  And I guess you did too, by the way you look now.\"  All this was vaguely complimentary, yet rather overdoing the thing, or so Erwin seemed to feel, for he sighed and turned on his pillow as if weary.  At this juncture the ward door again opened and there walked in several uniformed men who had just stepped out of a military car, visible through the temporarily open door.  One of these strode forward, while the rest followed.  This foremost one was of distinguished appearance and bore on arm and shoulder the insignia of a French general.  The others were also in uniform, except for one who wore a frock coat.  Just at this minute another door opened and there entered a tall, squarely built form in United States khaki, but without decoration except for the stars of a major general modestly affixed to his straight, stiff coat collar.  \"Why, there's General Pershing!\" whispered Blaine, keeping his hand at the salute which he had intuitively begun upon the appearance of the French.  \"Petain and Pershing!\" gasped Orris to himself, yet turning wearily from a futile attempt at saluting like the rest.  The two commanders greeted each other cordially, though the meeting was rather unexpected on the part of both.  Each had heard of the night bombardment which had taken place only a few days back.  Pershing was on his way to some American billet not far from here.  Petain, having already received reports of the recent exploits of the two airmen, and having decorated Blaine, was now bent upon doing similar things for this wounded American lad who had unwittingly been of such service to the French along its sector.  In a kindly and unassuming way Petain, now reinforced by the presence of the American general, complimented Orris on what he had done, concluding with: \"Not only did you and your comrade capture and bring home a German aviator and his machine, but you have sent two others in the earth and, after all this, while hard pressed by the enemy, you managed to descend upon the foe right where they were preparing for secret attack.  This you frustrated, at great physical cost to yourself.  For all this my Government bestows upon you this decoration.\"  While all the staff looked on, with nurses and flyers respectfully in the background, the general pinned on Erwin's breast a decoration similar to that bestowed upon Blaine.  Continuing, the general said:  \"When you are again able to rejoin the squadron, you, like your friend, will find that your own government has not only approved, but rewarded you also for what you have done.  Farewell!\"  The general with his escort left.  General Pershing stopped only long enough to shake hands informally with those remaining, particularly with Cheval, Blaine and finally with Erwin.  Walking with Sergeant Anson towards the door, the general turned, saying over his shoulder:  \"It wouldn't surprise me a little bit if the heads of the American Corps at Washington did not send you two something in the near future. If they do, try and live up to it.  Good-bye!\"  He was gone.  Monsieur Cheval had also followed, more slowly.  Blaine and Erwin looked at each other meaningfully.  \"Reckon anything will happen, Lafe?\"  \"How should I know, Orry?  Wait awhile and see.\"  Ten days later arrived two war medals, and two appointments; one for Blaine as sergeant in the aviation corps, the other for Orry as first corporal in the same.      CHAPTER V  THE PRACTICE DRILL  About the time that Corporal Orris Erwin was able to take his place again as a fighting aviator, Sergeant Blaine, returning from a long scouting raid over in the enemy's territory, met the boy in the broad drive of the aerodrome looking about him rather strangely.  He threw an arm over Orry's shoulder, and drew him along to the door of the Aero Club.  \"Been in here?\" he asked.  \"It is great!  They asking 'bout you the day we left.  Heard about Cheval?\"  Orris, not feeling like talking, shook his head, vouchsafing:  \"Nothing only that he went along with your squadron at the last minute.\"  \"Poor chap!  He won't raid with us again.  He went down near Essen. There was where we were to unload most of our bombs.  But Archie got him.  Down he went -\"   Blaine's eyes grew moist at the memory.  Erwin understood.   \"Nothing more?\" he ventured.  \"Nary thing, except that we gave the Krupp works hell for about fifteen or twenty minutes.  You should have seen the explosions.\"  \"That part was good.  Say, Blaine,\" Orris, was looking, thoughtful, \"has it ever struck you how terribly uncertain a thing life is --\"  \"Oh, rats!\" Blaine shook his smaller companion as they neared the club door.  \"Stow that sort of talk and thought!  Don't do you a bit of good or those that hear you.  See?\"  \"Still, since my last flight with you, these thing will run across my mind.  What is up now ?  You in on anything yet?\"  \"I've heard -- but don't whisper a word -- that we're on for a job of sausage driving next.  Nothing sure, though.\"  Sausages is the slang term for gas observation balloons which go up at certain points and observe the enemy's positions or maneuvers before and during battle on the earth below.  Sausages do not fight back much but are protected by support battle planes and in other ways.  Reaching the clubroom door, they entered, Blaine pushing his comrade forward and saying with mock politeness:  \"Let me present my comrade Erwin, or Orry, I like to call him.  While doing the Boches the other day at Appincourte Bluff, the Boches came mighty nigh doing him.  But here he is, what's left of him.  Jolly him a bit.  He feels bad!\"  The last tweak in allusion to Orry's remark on the uncertainty of life.  'There were a dozen or more of the air lads in the room and cigarette smoke tinged the air.  Towards Erwin, now recovered after nearly a three week's \"lay-off\" on account of his burns and other wounds, there was a general rush of friendly hands and voices.  \"Oh, you bully l'ill boy!  If I hadn't been kept so busy would have gone round to jolly you up a bit.  But I kept hearin' from you all the same.\"  This from Milton, or \"Milt\" Finzer, a Louisville lad, now in the Royal Flying Corps for more than a year. \"Don't it seem wallopin' to see you in the clubroom again!\"  \"Orry, you stale mutt,\" this from an Americanized Pole, without a trace of foreign accent, \"I'm too glad to see you to talk much about it. When we bombers got back from the raid that night and neither you nor Lafe had showed up, I felt bad enough.  Later when Lafe came in with a German plane and a half dead Boche inside, we felt better.  But we missed you, Orry.\"  \"Did you really and truly miss me?\" Erwin asked, this not in a spirit of doubt or incredulity, but only to hear his friend reemphasize it. One likes at times to have welcome truisms reechoed over again.  It is human nature I suppose.  \"Look here, Lex Brodno, you're a Pole --\"  \"Don't spring that on me again, even in joke I am an American, it my folks did come over from Warsaw.\"  \"Bully!  We're all one over here.  That's the way to talk!\"  Erwin was getting back his old-time spirits.  \"All one in the good old U.S.  All one over here -- eh?  Oh, you sinner!\"  The two walked over to a table, interrupted at every turn by those who wanted to welcome Orry back to the club again.  The following morning Erwin resumed his daily stunt of practice, but was heightened mightily in spirit by noticing in the hangar where he had usually gotten his machines a bright new scouting plane, small, with a tail like a dolphin's, an up-to-date machine gun mounted along the top, just where the one pilot at the wheel could handily squint through the sights.  \"Why, it's British -- one of their latest makes,\" informed Erwin, much pleased.  \"It's -- let's see.\"  He was squinting at the monogram. \"B-X-3.  No. 48.\"  Just then Blaine and Finzer strolled up.  \"Going out for a little spin, Orry?\" queried Blaine, throwing open wider the hangar door.  \"Look at 'em!  Ain't they beauts?\"  There was a row of eight of these snug-built machines, all the same type and monogram, all with machine guns strapped solidly to the fuselage of each, and with motors of great power and pliability.  \"You can do anything with these chaps,\" remarked Milt, \"except fly to the moon.  But these motors would take you a long way.  As for stunts like diving, circling, dipping, playing dead and the like, you never saw the like.  I only hope we go out soon.  I learn there's a new raid on the taps.\"  Blaine was nosing about one of the machines that was like the others, only a trifle larger and had an observer's seat behind the pilot's.  \"That's your, Sergeant?\" queried Erwin, slightly emphasizing the last word.  \"Bet your bottee wootees, Corporal!\"  Another slight emphasis on the last word.  \"As for yours, take your pick.  They're all exactly alike. We must go into preliminary practice today.\"  For an answer Erwin mechanically rolled out the machine he had first examined, and prepared for a short flight.  \"After all, all, these are much like the planes we used at Vimy last year."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6082"],["title","Our Pilots in the Air (#6)"],["body","\"  \"Some improvements and stronger motors added thought,\" said Blaine. \"Going to give it a try-out?\"  \"Yep!  Thought I'd like to get my hand in a bit before we go out in squad formation.\"  He nimbly  vaulted into his seat over the rim of the fuselage, or the body of the machine, as two mechanics pushed forward behind the wings.  An upward flip and the alert planes rose gently into the air, and Erwin was off.  His head was cool, his brain active, and more than all his hands were steady.  About this time Finzer had rolled out another plane and almost immediately rose behind Orris.  The two were at once climbing high, higher, until at an elevation of two to three thousand feet they began to circle, climb and dip in a way that reminded one of two high-flying birds playing at tag far up in the blue expanse of sky above.  Then Erwin's machine did a flip, bringing it above the other machine and \"onto its tail,\" the favorable position for aerial attack. Suddenly Finzer turned his nose earthward and began a whirling dive. Erwin followed; the other coming at once into horizontal poise, turned his nose towards Erwin -- the perfect position for pouring a rain of shot as the other passed.  Of course all this was mere practice, the full handed exercise of the fighting aviator, through which he keeps brain, eye and hand in trim against the perilous, heroic few seconds when he must fight to save his life and machine.  Meantime Blaine, along with Brodno, the Americanized Pole, and one or two others, strolled about, lazily watching the maneuvers above, and telling stories more or less related to their and fighting  experiences flying.  Presently down came the two fliers, each with heightened color and full of that fresh buoyancy which short, lively flights are apt to create. Both were flippantly arguing as to which one had got the best of the other.  \"I own up that I am a little bit stale, Milt.  But you wait until we go out for squadron practice.  I'll show you!\"  \"Yes, you will,\" replied Finzer, good-naturedly caustic.  \"Perhaps I'll show you another trick or two then.\"  And so the chaffing went on as the lads adjourned to the eating-house for lunch.  This meal over, a bugle sounded from the parade ground near the grove of trees.  It was the general summons for squadron practice.  As the boys filed out, each in full flying rig, they saw Commander Byers on the field, watching the mechanics roll out the machines.  There were a dozen or more of the fighting planes, like those which Erwin and Finzer had used for morning practice.  In the east, from over a monotonous expanse of scarred and war-torn country, came the sullen roar of artillery at the front, a stern reminder that real war was close at hand.  Each aviator at once mounted his own machine,         Blaine as squad sergeant in the one he had indicated to Erwin earlier in the day. Erwin took his, while Finzer, Brodno, and a real American lad from Butte, Montana, were assigned to others of these fast, nimble, scouting planes that are really the wasps of the air, carrying their sting with them, always ready and willing to bite.  Meanwhile at each machine two mechanics, under the eye of the airman, went carefully over the mechanism until all were satisfied.  Up they went, singly or in pairs, gyrating playfully, always climbing, and swooping higher, higher, until to the naked eye they became mere dots in the clear sky.  By this time it was noticeable that they had somehow divided into two squads or escadrilles; and at a signal from Commander Byers down below they began maneuvering like two hostile squadrons about to engage in aerial battle.  Thereupon ensued a display of battle tactics that would have been bewildering to an unaccustomed spectator.  These vicious little fighting planes reminded one more of air insects than of birds.  In their forward rushes many of them were doing more than two miles a minute.  \"Watch out!\" said the Commander, his glass at his eyes.  \"The Sergeant is going to loop.\"  True enough, Blaine's machine took a nose flip.  He was riding upside down.  Then he was level again.  The rest of his squad followed suit, then followed their leader at a daring angle, all of them straight and level again.  The first plane in the other line, driven by Erwin, began to loop the loop sidewise, rolling over and over, not unlike a horse rolls over when turned out to grass. The others behind him began much the same tactics while the first line drew away as if preparing for counter moves.  Beyond, in the further sky, two opposing machines having detached themselves from the rest were playing with each other like kittens with wings.  One was making rapid evolutions, the other following, and clinging to the set course in a series of whirls with its own wing-tip as a pivot.  Below, the comments went on from the staff surrounding the Commander, who would say now and then:  \"Look you there!  Was that not fine?\"  \"Hard to beat,\" seemed to be the general verdict.  \"Fritz will have to open his eyes tomorrow.\"  And so the show above went on.  A flock of little birds chirped and flopped past the group below.  What pikers they seemed by comparison, with the show going on above -- far above!  And now they were descending in long spirals, each squad by itself, yet preserving the mathematical distance required, both from the opposing squad and at the same time keeping the line prescribed for such tactics during drills at the home grounds.  Particularly did Blaine distinguish himself in the daring of his stunts.  Erwin was hardly behind him.  They looped again, they rolled, they did the wing and tail slides, doing the last until they fell almost perpendicularly a thousand feet.  Finally they righted hardly two hundred feet above the earth; then shot upward again at almost incredible speed.   And now the two leaders circled slowly as their respective squads followed on towards the ground, some falling, drifting like dead leaves, others slanting lazily as they passed the leaders, and on down, alighting at last each in his appointed place or thereabouts.  And then the two leaders began circling and swooping more and more rapidly until those below felt the  whirring rush of air as the two planes swept by so low that one imagined that an arm would nearly touch them.  All hands knew it was rivalry -- the rivalry of stunts.  Yet to stand below and watch those steel engines falling down on you from the skies took the same kind of nerve to keep from dodging as only airmen themselves are gifted with by practice.  Finally all this drew to a close.  The machines at last ranged themselves at opposite extremes of the landing stage and with a final swoop both were apparently upon the spectators as with the rush of a whirlwind.  Yet, dizzy as it looked, it was mathematically timed.  The two planes flattened as if by magic; they rose, dipped again and, passing each other in the down grade, saluted methodically as they passed the Commander.  Ten seconds later their wheels dropped gently on the gravel at either end of the parade ground two tired looking aviators left their the waiting mechanics and walked soberly to the others.  The stunts were over for the day.      CHAPTER VI  CATCHING THB SPY  \"Well, well, Orry!  How do you feel after your stunts of yesterday?\"  This from Sergeant Blaine as he jumped from his bunk in the aerodrome dormitory the following morning just as the dawn was breaking.  Erwin, still drowsing, opened one eye.  The next instant, remembering what the day probably hold in store for him, he threw off the covers and leapt from his bunk.  At the same time, in order impress Blaine with his general fitness, he hit the big Sergeant a mock blow on the midwind region where, according to ring history, Fitzsimons dropped Corbett in their historic championship fight.  Then he sprang back, arms and fists feinting.  \"Can't you see how I feel?\" he retorted.  \"Want to try me more?\"  \"Nit, you shyster, nit!\"  Blaine was laughing as he recovered, retreating and grimacing, as if in mock misery.  \"I don't want no more solar plexus stuff at this stage of the game.  I guess you're all right.\"  \"Bet your thick cocoanut I am!  I was a bit drowsy at first.  Say, Lafe, you know I must be in on this, whatever it is.\"  \"Sure!  I was at first a bit afraid that all those air stunts might have frazzled you a little, seeing you are just out of hospital.\"  \"Honest Injun, Lafe, I'm all right!  Don't you forget to remember that!\"  \"Well, then, get your clothes on.  I want to talk to you private like.\"  And Blaine sauntered off, lighting, a cigarette, while Erwin hastily put on his clothes.  Going out soon, he encountered Blaine on the parade before the hangars where the starting of planes usually began.  It promised to be a lovely day.  Not a cloud was in the sky.  Off to the east a lone airplane was, soaring high over No-Man Is-Land, doubtless one of the night scouts that are maintained along that portion of the front.  Said Lafe:  \"Last night after the rest of you had gone to the clubroom, Byers sent for me and told me briefly what he wanted us to attempt today.  You know those sausages the Boches got now, over back of that bluff you unearthed the day you came home after our last raid?\"  \"Appincourte?\"  Orris blinked and nodded.  \"I ought to remember.\"  \"Well, the French have tried a time or two to get them, but the Boche planes have been too much for them so far.  Kept them so busy fighting back, they had no time to do much bombing.  And now word has come from headquarters that they must go.  Must!  See?\"  Erwin nodded.  He took a deep breath, feeling already the lift in the pure morning air.  Blaine continued:  \"Well, Anson was to have headed this raid, but he's been promoted also.  He's an ensign now.  I am in his place and they made you corporal under me for two reasons.  One was on account of the stunts you did along with me; then for what you did after you went on your own hook and busted into that Boche"]]]
