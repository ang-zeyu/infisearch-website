He worked mighty hard mixing all sorts of things together, until finally he evolved a substance that looked like powder.  He had been very proud of the stuff, and had gone about the village of the Sarians exhibiting it to every one who would listen to him, and explaining what its purpose was and what terrific havoc it would work, until finally the natives became so terrified at the stuff that they wouldn't come within a rod of Perry and his invention.  Finally, I suggested that we experiment with it and see what it would do, so Perry built a fire, after placing the powder at a safe distance, and then touched a glowing ember to a minute particle of the deadly explosive.  It extinguished the ember.  Repeated experiments with it determined me that in searching for a high explosive, Perry had stumbled upon a fire-extinguisher that would have made his fortune for him back in our own world.  So now he set himself to work to build a scientific canoe.  I had suggested that we construct a dugout, but Perry convinced me that we must build something more in keeping with our positions of supermen in this world of the Stone Age.  \"We must impress these natives with our superiority,\" he explained. \"You must not forget, David, that you are emperor of Pellucidar.  As such you may not with dignity approach the shores of a foreign power in so crude a vessel as a dugout.\"  I pointed out to Perry that it wasn't much more incongruous for the emperor to cruise in a canoe, than it was for the prime minister to attempt to build one with his own hands.  He had to smile at that; but in extenuation of his act he assured me that it was quite customary for prime ministers to give their personal attention to the building of imperial navies; \"and this,\" he said, \"is the imperial navy of his Serene Highness, David I, Emperor of the Federated Kingdoms of Pellucidar.\"  I grinned; but Perry was quite serious about it.  It had always seemed rather more or less of a joke to me that I should be addressed as majesty and all the rest of it.  Yet my imperial power and dignity had been a very real thing during my brief reign.  Twenty tribes had joined the federation, and their chiefs had sworn eternal fealty to one another and to me.  Among them were many powerful though savage nations.  Their chiefs we had made kings; their tribal lands kingdoms.  We had armed them with bows and arrows and swords, in addition to their own more primitive weapons.  I had trained them in military discipline and in so much of the art of war as I had gleaned from extensive reading of the campaigns of Napoleon, Von Moltke, Grant, and the ancients.  We had marked out as best we could natural boundaries dividing the various kingdoms.  We had warned tribes beyond these boundaries that they must not trespass, and we had marched against and severely punished those who had.  We had met and defeated the Mahars and the Sagoths.  In short, we had demonstrated our rights to empire, and very rapidly were we being recognized and heralded abroad when my departure for the outer world and Hooja's treachery had set us back.  But now I had returned.  The work that fate had undone must be done again, and though I must need smile at my imperial honors, I none the less felt the weight of duty and obligation that rested upon my shoulders.  Slowly the imperial navy progressed toward completion.  She was a wondrous craft, but I had my doubts about her.  When I voiced them to Perry, he reminded me gently that my people for many generations had been mine-owners, not ship-builders, and consequently I couldn't be expected to know much about the matter.  I was minded to inquire into his hereditary fitness to design battleships; but inasmuch as I already knew that his father had been a minister in a back-woods village far from the coast, I hesitated lest I offend the dear old fellow.  He was immensely serious about his work, and I must admit that in so far as appearances went he did extremely well with the meager tools and assistance at his command.  We had only two short axes and our hunting-knives; yet with these we hewed trees, split them into planks, surfaced and fitted them.  The \"navy\" was some forty feet in length by ten feet beam.  Her sides were quite straight and fully ten feet high--\"for the purpose,\" explained Perry, \"of adding dignity to her appearance and rendering it less easy for an enemy to board her.\"  As a matter of fact, I knew that he had had in mind the safety of her crew under javelin-fire--the lofty sides made an admirable shelter. Inside she reminded me of nothing so much as a floating trench.  There was also some slight analogy to a huge coffin.  Her prow sloped sharply backward from the water-line--quite like a line of battleship.  Perry had designed her more for moral effect upon an enemy, I think, than for any real harm she might inflict, and so those parts which were to show were the most imposing.  Below the water-line she was practically non-existent.  She should have had considerable draft; but, as the enemy couldn't have seen it, Perry decided to do away with it, and so made her flat-bottomed.  It was this that caused my doubts about her.  There was another little idiosyncrasy of design that escaped us both until she was about ready to launch--there was no method of propulsion. Her sides were far too high to permit the use of sweeps, and when Perry suggested that we pole her, I remonstrated on the grounds that it would be a most undignified and awkward manner of sweeping down upon the foe, even if we could find or wield poles that would reach to the bottom of the ocean.  Finally I suggested that we convert her into a sailing vessel.  When once the idea took hold Perry was most enthusiastic about it, and nothing would do but a four-masted, full-rigged ship.  Again I tried to dissuade him, but he was simply crazy over the psychological effect which the appearance of this strange and mighty craft would have upon the natives of Pellucidar.  So we rigged her with thin hides for sails and dried gut for rope.  Neither of us knew much about sailing a full-rigged ship; but that didn't worry me a great deal, for I was confident that we should never be called upon to do so, and as the day of launching approached I was positive of it.  We had built her upon a low bank of the river close to where it emptied into the sea, and just above high tide.  Her keel we had laid upon several rollers cut from small trees, the ends of the rollers in turn resting upon parallel tracks of long saplings.  Her stern was toward the water.  A few hours before we were ready to launch her she made quite an imposing picture, for Perry had insisted upon setting every shred of \"canvas.\"  I told him that I didn't know much about it, but I was sure that at launching the hull only should have been completed, everything else being completed after she had floated safely.  At the last minute there was some delay while we sought a name for her. I wanted her christened the Perry in honor both of her designer and that other great naval genius of another world, Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, of the United States Navy.  But Perry was too modest; he wouldn't hear of it.  We finally decided to establish a system in the naming of the fleet. Battle-ships of the first-class should bear the names of kingdoms of the federation; armored cruisers the names of kings; cruisers the names of cities, and so on down the line.  Therefore, we decided to name the first battle-ship Sari, after the first of the federated kingdoms.  The launching of the Sari proved easier than I contemplated.  Perry wanted me to get in and break something over the bow as she floated out upon the bosom of the river, but I told him that I should feel safer on dry land until I saw which side up the Sari would float.  I could see by the expression of the old man's face that my words had hurt him; but I noticed that he didn't offer to get in himself, and so I felt less contrition than I might otherwise.  When we cut the ropes and removed the blocks that held the Sari in place she started for the water with a lunge.  Before she hit it she was going at a reckless speed, for we had laid our tracks quite down to the water, greased them, and at intervals placed rollers all ready to receive the ship as she moved forward with stately dignity.  But there was no dignity in the Sari.  When she touched the surface of the river she must have been going twenty or thirty miles an hour.  Her momentum carried her well out into the stream, until she came to a sudden halt at the end of the long line which we had had the foresight to attach to her bow and fasten to a large tree upon the bank.  The moment her progress was checked she promptly capsized.  Perry was overwhelmed.  I didn't upbraid him, nor remind him that I had \"told him so.\"  His grief was so genuine and so apparent that I didn't have the heart to reproach him, even were I inclined to that particular sort of meanness.  \"Come, come, old man!\" I cried.  \"It's not as bad as it looks.  Give me a hand with this rope, and we'll drag her up as far as we can; and then when the tide goes out we'll try another scheme.  I think we can make a go of her yet.\"  Well, we managed to get her up into shallow water.  When the tide receded she lay there on her side in the mud, quite a pitiable object for the premier battle-ship of a world--\"the terror of the seas\" was the way Perry had occasionally described her.  We had to work fast; but before the tide came in again we had stripped her of her sails and masts, righted her, and filled her about a quarter full of rock ballast.  If she didn't stick too fast in the mud I was sure that she would float this time right side up.  I can tell you that it was with palpitating hearts that we sat upon the river-bank and watched that tide come slowly in.  The tides of Pellucidar don't amount to much by comparison with our higher tides of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/605"],["title","Pellucidar (#7)"],["body","outer world, but I knew that it ought to prove ample to float the Sari.  Nor was I mistaken.  Finally we had the satisfaction of seeing the vessel rise out of the mud and float slowly upstream with the tide.  As the water rose we pulled her in quite close to the bank and clambered aboard.  She rested safely now upon an even keel; nor did she leak, for she was well calked with fiber and tarry pitch.  We rigged up a single short mast and light sail, fastened planking down over the ballast to form a deck, worked her out into midstream with a couple of sweeps, and dropped our primitive stone anchor to await the turn of the tide that would bear us out to sea.  While we waited we devoted the time to the construction of an upper deck, since the one immediately above the ballast was some seven feet from the gunwale.  The second deck was four feet above this.  In it was a large, commodious hatch, leading to the lower deck.  The sides of the ship rose three feet above the upper deck, forming an excellent breastwork, which we loopholed at intervals that we might lie prone and fire upon an enemy.  Though we were sailing out upon a peaceful mission in search of my friend Ja, we knew that we might meet with people of some other island who would prove unfriendly.  At last the tide turned.  We weighed anchor.  Slowly we drifted down the great river toward the sea.  About us swarmed the mighty denizens of the primeval deep--plesiosauri and ichthyosauria with all their horrid, slimy cousins whose names were as the names of aunts and uncles to Perry, but which I have never been able to recall an hour after having heard them.  At last we were safely launched upon the journey to which we had looked forward for so long, and the results of which meant so much to me.    CHAPTER IV  FRIENDSHIP AND TREACHERY  The Sari proved a most erratic craft.  She might have done well enough upon a park lagoon if safely anchored, but upon the bosom of a mighty ocean she left much to be desired.  Sailing with the wind she did her best; but in quartering or when close-hauled she drifted terribly, as a nautical man might have guessed she would.  We couldn't keep within miles of our course, and our progress was pitifully slow.  Instead of making for the island of Anoroc, we bore far to the right, until it became evident that we should have to pass between the two right-hand islands and attempt to return toward Anoroc from the opposite side.  As we neared the islands Perry was quite overcome by their beauty. When we were directly between two of them he fairly went into raptures; nor could I blame him.  The tropical luxuriance of the foliage that dripped almost to the water's edge and the vivid colors of the blooms that shot the green made a most gorgeous spectacle.  Perry was right in the midst of a flowery panegyric on the wonders of the peaceful beauty of the scene when a canoe shot out from the nearest island.  There were a dozen warriors in it; it was quickly followed by a second and third.  Of course we couldn't know the intentions of the strangers, but we could pretty well guess them.  Perry wanted to man the sweeps and try to get away from them, but I soon convinced him that any speed of which the Sari was capable would be far too slow to outdistance the swift, though awkward, dugouts of the Mezops.  I waited until they were quite close enough to hear me, and then I hailed them.  I told them that we were friends of the Mezops, and that we were upon a visit to Ja of Anoroc, to which they replied that they were at war with Ja, and that if we would wait a minute they'd board us and throw our corpses to the azdyryths.  I warned them that they would get the worst of it if they didn't leave us alone, but they only shouted in derision and paddled swiftly toward us.  It was evident that they were considerably impressed by the appearance and dimensions of our craft, but as these fellows know no fear they were not at all awed.  Seeing that they were determined to give battle, I leaned over the rail of the Sari and brought the imperial battle-squadron of the Emperor of Pellucidar into action for the first time in the history of a world. In other and simpler words, I fired my revolver at the nearest canoe.  The effect was magical.  A warrior rose from his knees, threw his paddle aloft, stiffened into rigidity for an instant, and then toppled overboard.  The others ceased paddling, and, with wide eyes, looked first at me and then at the battling sea-things which fought for the corpse of their comrade.  To them it must have seemed a miracle that I should be able to stand at thrice the range of the most powerful javelin-thrower and with a loud noise and a smudge of smoke slay one of their number with an invisible missile.  But only for an instant were they paralyzed with wonder.  Then, with savage shouts, they fell once more to their paddles and forged rapidly toward us.  Again and again I fired.  At each shot a warrior sank to the bottom of the canoe or tumbled overboard.  When the prow of the first craft touched the side of the Sari it contained only dead and dying men.  The other two dugouts were approaching rapidly, so I turned my attention toward them.  I think that they must have been commencing to have some doubts--those wild, naked, red warriors--for when the first man fell in the second boat, the others stopped paddling and commenced to jabber among themselves.  The third boat pulled up alongside the second and its crews joined in the conference.  Taking advantage of the lull in the battle, I called out to the survivors to return to their shore.  \"I have no fight with you,\" I cried, and then I told them who I was and added that if they would live in peace they must sooner or later join forces with me.  \"Go back now to your people,\" I counseled them, \"and tell them that you have seen David I, Emperor of the Federated Kingdoms of Pellucidar, and that single-handed he has overcome you, just as he intends overcoming the Mahars and the Sagoths and any other peoples of Pellucidar who threaten the peace and welfare of his empire.\"  Slowly they turned the noses of their canoes toward land.  It was evident that they were impressed; yet that they were loath to give up without further contesting my claim to naval supremacy was also apparent, for some of their number seemed to be exhorting the others to a renewal of the conflict.  However, at last they drew slowly away, and the Sari, which had not decreased her snail-like speed during this, her first engagement, continued upon her slow, uneven way.  Presently Perry stuck his head up through the hatch and hailed me.  \"Have the scoundrels departed?\" he asked.  \"Have you killed them all?\"  \"Those whom I failed to kill have departed, Perry,\" I replied.  He came out on deck and, peering over the side, descried the lone canoe floating a short distance astern with its grim and grisly freight. Farther his eyes wandered to the retreating boats.  \"David,\" said he at last, \"this is a notable occasion.  It is a great day in the annals of Pellucidar.  We have won a glorious victory.  \"Your majesty's navy has routed a fleet of the enemy thrice its own size, manned by ten times as many men.  Let us give thanks.\"  I could scarce restrain a smile at Perry's use of the pronoun \"we,\" yet I was glad to share the rejoicing with him as I shall always be glad to share everything with the dear old fellow.  Perry is the only male coward I have ever known whom I could respect and love.  He was not created for fighting; but I think that if the occasion should ever arise where it became necessary he would give his life cheerfully for me--yes, I KNOW it.  It took us a long time to work around the islands and draw in close to Anoroc.  In the leisure afforded we took turns working on our map, and by means of the compass and a little guesswork we set down the shoreline we had left and the three islands with fair accuracy.  Crossed sabers marked the spot where the first great naval engagement of a world had taken place.  In a note-book we jotted down, as had been our custom, details that would be of historical value later.  Opposite Anoroc we came to anchor quite close to shore.  I knew from my previous experience with the tortuous trails of the island that I could never find my way inland to the hidden tree-village of the Mezop chieftain, Ja; so we remained aboard the Sari, firing our express rifles at intervals to attract the attention of the natives.  After some ten shots had been fired at considerable intervals a body of copper-colored warriors appeared upon the shore.  They watched us for a moment and then I hailed them, asking the whereabouts of my old friend Ja.  They did not reply at once, but stood with their heads together in serious and animated discussion.  Continually they turned their eyes toward our strange craft.  It was evident that they were greatly puzzled by our appearance as well as unable to explain the source of the loud noises that had attracted their attention to us.  At last one of the warriors addressed us.  \"Who are you who seek Ja?\" he asked.  \"What would you of our chief?\"  \"We are friends,\" I replied.  \"I am David.  Tell Ja that David, whose life he once saved from a sithic, has come again to visit him.  \"If you will send out a canoe we will come ashore.  We cannot bring our great warship closer in.\"  Again they talked for a considerable time.  Then two of them entered a canoe that several dragged from its hiding-place in the jungle and paddled swiftly toward us.  They were magnificent specimens of manhood.  Perry had never seen a member of this red race close to before.  In fact, the dead men in the canoe we had left astern after the battle and the survivors who were paddling rapidly toward their shore were the first he ever had seen. He had been greatly impressed by their physical beauty and the promise of superior intelligence which their well-shaped skulls gave.  The two who now paddled out received us into "]]]
