I knew not the particulars of the affair in which Arthur Heselrigge fell, till I heard it from your lips.  I can easily credit them, for I know his unmanly character. Wallace is a Scot, and acted in Scotland as Gilbert Hambledon would have done in England, were it possible for any vile foreigner to there put his foot upon the neck of a countryman of mine. Wherever you have concealed your husband, let it be a distant asylum.  At present no tract within the jurisdiction of Lanark will be left unsearched by the governor's indefatigable revenge.\"  Lady Wallace, overcome with gratitude at this generous speech of the English officer, uttered some inarticulate words, expressive more in sound than clearness, of her grateful feelings.  Hambledon continued, \"I will use my influence with Heselrigge, to prevent the interior of your house from being disturbed again; but it being in the course of military operations, I cannot free you from the disagreeable ceremony of a guard being placed to-morrow morning round the domains.  This I know will be done to intercept Sir William Wallace should he attempt to return.\"  \"Oh! That he were indeed far distant!\" thought the anxious Marion.  The officer then added, \"However, you shall be relieved of my detachment directly.\"  And as he spoke, he waved his sword to them who had seized the harper.  They advanced, still holding their prisoner. He ordered them to commit the man to him, and to sound.  The trumpeter obeyed; and in a few seconds the whole detachment were assembled before their commander.  \"Soldiers!\" cried he, \"Sir William Wallace has escaped our hands. Mount your horses, that we may return to Lanark, and search the other side of the town.  Lead forth, and I will follow.\"  The troops obeyed, and falling back through the open gates, left Sir Gilbert Hambledon alone with Lady Wallace and the wondering Halbert. The brave young man took the now no longer withdrawn hand of the grateful Marion, who had stood trembling while so many of her husband's mortal enemies were assembled under the place of his concealment.  \"Noble Englishman,\" said she, as the last body of soldiers passed from her sight, \"I cannot enough thank you for this generous conduct; but should you or yours be ever in the like extremity with my beloved Wallace (and in these tyrannous times, what brave spirit can answer for its continued safety?) may the ear which has heard you this night, at that hour repay my gratitude!\"  \"Sweet lady,\" answered Hambledon, \"I thank you for your prayer.  God is indeed the benefactor of a true soldier; and though I serve my king, and obey my commanders, yet it is only to the Lord of battles that I look for a sure reward.  And whether he pay me here with victories and honors, or take my soul through a rent in my breast, to receive my laurel in paradise, it is all one to Gilbert Hambledon.  But the night is cold: I must see you safe within your own doors, and then, lady, farewell!\"  Lady Wallace yielded to the impulse of his hand, and with redoubled haste, as she heard another rustling in the tree above her head. Hambledon did not notice it; but desiring Halbert to follow, in a few minutes disappeared with the agitated Marion into the house.  Wallace, whose spirit could ill brook the sight of his domains filled with hostile troops, and the wife of his bosom brought a prisoner before their commander, would instantly have braved all dangers, and have leaped down amongst them; but at the instant he placed his foot on a lower bough to make a spring, the courteous address of Hambledon to his wife had made him hesitate.  He listened to the replies of his Marion with exultation; and when the Englishman ordered his men to withdraw, and delivered himself so generously respecting the safety of the man he came to seize, Wallace could hardly prevent a brave confidence in such virtue from compelling him to come from his concealment, and thank his noble enemy on the spot.  But in consideration that such disclosure would put the military duty and the generous nature of the officer at variance, he desisted, with such an agitation of spirits that the boughs had again shaken under him, and reawakened the alarm of his trembling wife.  \"Omnipotent virtue!\" exclaimed Wallace to himself; \"if it were possible that thy generous spirit could animate the breast of an invading conqueror, how soon would the vanquished cease to forget their former freedom, and learn to love their vassalage!  This man's nobleness, how soon has it quenched the flame of vengeance with which, when I ascended this tree, I prayed for the extirpation of every follower of Edward!\"  \"Sir William! my master!\" cried a well-known voice, in a suppressed tone, as if still fearful of being overheard.  It was Halbert's. \"Speak, my dear lord; are you safe?\"  \"In heart and body!\" returned Wallace, sliding from the tree, and leaping on the ground.  \"One only of the arrows touched me; and that merely striking my bugle, fell back amongst the leaves.  I must now hasten to the dearest, the noblest of women!\"  Halbert begged him to stay till they should hear the retreat from the English trumpets.  \"Till their troops are out of sight,\" added he, \"I cannot believe you safe.\"  \"Hark!\" cried Wallace, \"the horses are now descending the craig.  That must satisfy you, honest Halbert.\"  With these words he flew across the grass, and entering the house, met the returning Marion, who had just bade farewell to Hambledon.  She rushed into his arms, and with the excess of a disturbed and uncertain joy, fainted on his neck.  Her gentle spirit had been too powerfully excited by the preceding scenes. Unaccustomed to tumult of any king, and nursed in the bosom of fondness till now, no blast had blown on her tender form, no harshness had ever ruffled the blissful serenity of her mind.  What then was the shock of this evening's violence!  Her husband pursued as a murderer; herself exposed to the midnight air, and dragged by the hands of merciless soldiers to betray the man she loved!  All these scenes were new to her; and though a kind of preternatural strength had supported her over, when she fell once more into her husband's extended arms, she seemed there to have found again her shelter, and the pillow whereon her harassed soul might repose.  \"My life! My best treasure! Preserver of thy Wallace! Look on him!\" exclaimed he; \"bless him with a smile from those dear eyes.\"  His voice, his caresses, soon restored her to sensibility and recollection.  She wept on his breast, and with love's own eloquence, thanked Heaven that he had escaped the search and the arrows of his enemies.  \"But my dear lady,\" interrupted Halbert, \"remember my master must not stay here.  You know the English commander said he must fly far away. Nay, spies may even now be lurking to betray him.\"  \"You are right,\" cried she.  \"My Wallace, you must depart.  Should the guard arrive soon, your flight may be prevented.  You must go now--but, oh! whither?\"  \"Not far distant, my love.  In going from thee, I leave behind all that makes my life precious to me; how then can I go far away?  No! there are recesses among the Cartlane Craigs, I discovered while hunting, and which I believe have been visited by no mortal foot but my own.  There I will be, my Marion, before sunrise; and before it sets, thither you must send Halbert, to tell me how you fare.  Three notes from thine own sweet strains of Thusa ha measg na reultan mor,** blown by his pipe, shall be a sign to me that he is there; and I will come forth to hear tidings of thee.\"  **Thusa ha measg na reultan mor, etc., are the beginning words of an old Gaelic ditty, the English of which runs thus: \"Thou who art amid the stars, move to thy bed with music,\" etc.-(1809.)  \"Ah, my Wallace, let me go with thee!\"  \"What, dearest!\" returned he, \"to live amidst rocks and streams! to expose thy tender self, and thine unborn infant, to all the accidents of such a lodging!\"  \"But are not you going to so rough, so dangerous a lodging?\" asked she. \"O! would not rocks and streams be Heaven's paradise to me, when blessed by the presence of my husband?  Ah! let me go!\"  \"Impossible, my lady,\" cried Halbert, afraid that the melting heart of his master would consent: \"you are safe here; and your flight would awaken suspicion in the English, that he had not gone far.  Your ease and safety are dearer to him than his own life; and most likely by his care to preserve them, he would be traced, and so fall a ready sacrifice to the enemy.\"  \"It is true, my Marion; I could not preserve you in the places to which I go.\"  \"But the hardships you will endure!\" cried she; \"to sleep on the cold stones, with no covering but the sky, or the dripping vault of some dreary cave!  I have not courage to abandon you alone to such cruel rigors.\"  \"Cease, my beloved!\" interrupted he, \"cease these groundless alarms. Neither rocks nor storms have any threats to me.  It is only tender woman's cares that make man's body delicate.  Before I was thine, my Marion, I have lain whole nights upon the mountain's brow, counting the wintery stars, as I impatiently awaited the hunter's horn that was to recall me to the chase in Glenfinlass.  Alike to Wallace is the couch of down or the bed of heather; so, best-beloved of my heart, grieve not at hardships which were once my sport, and will now be my safety.\"  \"Then farewell!  May good angels guard thee!\"  Her voice failed; she put his hand to her lips.  \"Courage, my Marion,\" said he; \"remember that Wallace lives but in thee.  Revive, be happy for my sake; and God, who putteth down the oppressor, will restore me to thine arms.\"  She spoke not, but rising from his breast, clasped her hands together, and looked up with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6086"],["title","The Scottish Chiefs (#6)"],["body","expression of fervent prayer; then smiling through a shower of tears, she waved her hand to him to depart, and instantly disappeared into her own chamber.  Wallace gazed at the closed door, with his soul in his eyes.  To leave his Marion thus, to quit her who was the best part of his being, who seemed the very spring of the life now throbbing in his heart, was a contention with his fond, fond love, almost too powerful for his resolution.  Here indeed his brave spirit gave way; and he would have followed her, and perhaps have determined to await his face at her side, had not Halbert, reading his mind in his countenance, taken him by the arm, and drawn him toward the portal.  Wallace soon recovered his better reason, and obeying the friendly impulse of his servant, accompanied him through the garden, to the quarter which pointed toward the heights that led to the remotest recesses of the Clyde.  In their way they approached the well where Lord Mar lay.  Finding that the earl had not been inquired for, Wallace deemed his stay to be without peril; and intending to inform him of the necessity which still impelled his own flight, he called to him, but no voice answered.  He looked down, and seeing him extended on the bottom without motion, \"I fear,\" said he, \"the earl is dead.  As soon as I am gone, and you can collect the dispersed servants, send one into the well to bring him forth; and if he be indeed no more, deposit his body in my oratory, till you can receive his widow's commands respecting his remains.  The iron box now in the well is of inestimable value; take it to Lady Wallace and tell her she must guard it, as she has done my life; but not to look into it, at the peril of what is yet dearer to her--my honor.\"  Halbert promised to adhere to his master's orders; and Wallace, girding on his sword, and taking his hunting-spear (with which the care of his venerable domestic had provided him), he pressed the faithful hand that presented it, and again enjoining him to be watchful of the tranquillity of his lady, and to send him tidings of her in the evening, to the cave near the Corie Lynn, he climbed the wall, and was out of sight in an instant.     Chapter III.  Ellerslie.   Halbert returned to the house; and entering the room softly, into which Marion had withdrawn, beheld her on her knees before a crucifix; she was praying for the safety of her husband.  \"May he, O gracious Lord!\" cried she, \"soon return to his home.  But if I am to see him here no more, oh, may it please thee to grant me to meet him within thy arms in heaven!\"  \"Hear her, blessed Son of Mary!\" ejaculated the old man.  She looked round, and rising from her knees, demanded of him, in a kind but anxious voice, whether he had left her lord in security.  \"In the way to it, my lady!\" answered Halbert.  He repeated all that Wallace had said at parting, and then tried to prevail on her to go to rest.  \"Sleep cannot visit my eyes this night, my faithful creature,\" replied she; \"my spirit will follow Wallace in his mountain flight.  Go you to your chamber.  After you have had repose, that will be time enough to revisit the remains of the poor earl, and to bring them with the box to the house.  I will take a religious charge of both, for the sake of the dear intruster.\"  Halbert persuaded his aldy to lie down on the bed, that her limbs at least might rest after the fatigue of so harassing a night; and she, little suspecting that he meant to do otherwise than to sleep also, kindly wished him repose and retired.  Her maids, during the late terror, had dispersed, and were nowhere to be found; and the men, too, after their stout resistance at the gates, had all disappeared; some fled others were sent away prisoners to Lanark, while the good Hambledon was conversing with their lady. Halbert, therefore, resigned himself to await with patience the rising of the sun, when he hoped some of the scared domestics would return; if not, he determined to go to the cotters who lived in the depths of the glen, and bring some of them to supply the place of the fugitives; and a few, with stouter hearts, to guard his lady.  Thus musing, he sat on a stone bench in the hall, watching anxiously the appearance of that orb, whose setting beams he hoped would light him back with tidings of William Wallace to comfort the lonely heart of his Marion.  All seemed at peace.  Nothing was hear but the sighing of the trees as they waved before the western window, which opened toward the Lanark hills.  The morning was yet gray, and the fresh air blowing in rather chilly, Halbert rose to close the wooden shutter; at that moment, his eyes were arrested by a party of armed men in quick march down the opposite declivity.  In a few minutes more their heavy steps sounded in his ears, and he saw the platform before the house filled with English.  Alarmed at the sight, he was retreating across the apartment, toward his lady's room, when the great hall door was burst open by a band of soldiers, who rushed forward and seized him.  \"Tell me, dotard!\" cried their leader, a man of low stature, with gray locks, but a fierce countenance, \"where is the murderer?  Where is Sir William Wallace?  Speak, or the torture shall force you.\"  Halbert shuddered, but it was for his defenseless lady, not for himself.  \"My master,\" said he, \"is far from this.\"  \"Where?\"  \"I know not.\"  \"Thou shalt be made to know, thou hoary-headed villian!\" cried the same violent interrogator.  \"Where is the assassin's wife?  I will confront ye.  Seek her out.\"  At that word the soldiers parted right and left, and in a moment afterward three of them appeared, with shouts, bringing in the trembling Marion.  \"Alas! my lady!\" cried Halbert, struggling to approach her, as with terrified apprehension she looked around her; but they held her fast, and he saw her led up to the merciless wretch who had given the orders to have her summoned.  \"Woman!\" cried he, \"I am the Governor of Lanark.  You now stand before the representative of the great King Edward, and on your allegiance to him, and on the peril of your life, I command you to answer me three questions.  Where is Sir William Wallace, the murderer of my nephew? Who is that old Scot, for whom my nephew was slain?  He and his whole family shall meet my vengeance!  And tell me where is that box of treasure which your husband stole from Douglas Castle?  Answer me these questions on your life.\"  Lady Wallace remained silent.  \"Speak, woman,\" demanded the governor.  \"If fear cannot move you, know that I can reward as well as avenge.  I will endow you richly, if you declare the truth.  If you persist to refuse, you die.\"  \"Then I die,\" replied she, scarcely opening her half-closed eyes, as she leaned, fainting and motionless, against the soldier who held her.  \"What?\" cried the governor, stifling his rage, in hopes to gain by persuasion on a spirit he found threats could not intimidate; \"can so gentle a lady reject the favor of England, large grants in this country, and perhaps a fine English knight for a husband, when you might have all for the trifling service of giving up a traitor to his liege lord, and confessing where his robberies lie concealed?  Speak, fair dame; give me this information, and the lands of the wounded chieftain whom Wallace brought here, with the hand of the handsome Sir Gilbert Hambledon, shall be your reward.  Rich, and a beauty in Edward's court!  Lady, can you now refuse to purchase all, by declaring the hiding place of the traitor Wallace?\"  \"It is easier to die!\"  \"Fool!\" cried Heselrigge, driven from his assumed temper by her steady denial.  \"What? is it easier for these dainty limbs to be hacked to pieces by my soldiers' axes?  Is it easier for that fair bosom to be trodden underfoot by my horse's hoofs, and for that beauteous head of thine to decorate my lance?  Is all this easier than to tell me where to find a murderer and his gold?\"  Lady Wallace shuddered; she stretched her hands to heaven.  \"Speak once for all!\" cried the enraged governor, drawing his sword; \"I am no waxen-hearted Hambledon, to be cajoled by your beauty.  Declare where Wallace is concealed, or dread my vengeance.\"  The horrid steel gleamed across the eyes of the unhappy Marion; unable to sustain herself, she sunk to the ground.  \"Kneel not to me for mercy!\" cried the fierce wretch; \"I grant none, unless you confess your husband's hiding-place.\"  A momentary strength darted from the heart of Lady Wallace to her voice, \"I kneel to Heaven alone, and may it ever preserve my Wallace from the fangs of Edward and his tyrants!\"  \"Blasphemous wretch!\" cried the infuriated Heselrigge; and in that moment he plunged his sword into her defenseless breast.  Halbert, who had all this time been held back by the soldiers, could not believe that the fierce governor would perpetrate the horrid deed he threatened; but seeing it done, with a giant's strength and a terrible cry he burst from the hands that held him, and had thrown himself on the bleeding Marion, before her murderer could strike his second blow. However, it fell, and pierced through the neck of the faithful servant before it reached her heart.  She opened her dying eyes, and seeing who it was that would have shielded her life, just articulated, \"Halbert! my Wallace--to God--\" and with that last unfinished sentence her pure soul took its flight to regions of eternal piece.  The good old man's heart almost burst when he felt that before--heaving bosom now motionless; and groaning with grief, and fainting with loss of blood, he lay senseless on her body.  A terrible stillness was now in the hall.  Not a man spoke; all stood looking on each other, with a stern horror marking each pale countenance.  Heselrigge, dropping his blood-stained sword on the ground, perceived by the behavior of his men that he had gone too far, and fearful of arousing the indignation of awakened humanity, to some act against himself, he addressed the soldiers in an"]]]
