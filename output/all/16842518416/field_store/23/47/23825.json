The question is, which one?\"  \"Perhaps both vos guilty,\" suggested the German student.  \"That may be true, Hans,\" came from Tom.  \"I wonder if one or the other of the rascals is in hiding around here?\"  \"We'll begin a search,\" said Sam.  \"Hans, go and call the others,\" and at once the German cadet started off on his errand.     CHAPTER IV  A TRAIL IS FOUND AND LOST   By this time several carriages had come up, also a number of folks on bicycles and on foot, and to all of these the situation had to be explained.  Among the last to put in an appearance was Captain Putnam, and he was at once all attention, and desired to know how seriously Dick and Frank were injured.  \"It was an outrageous piece of work,\" he said.  \"Still, to be fair, we must admit that the broken brake is largely responsible for what happened, after the start down hill was made.\"  \"But I couldn't help the brake breaking,\" pleaded the general utility man.  \"I did my best, and was thrown out--\"  \"I am not finding fault with you, Snugger,\" cut in the captain, shortly.  \"Let it pass, and leave the stage to be taken care of by the Cedarville blacksmith.  But I wish we might lay hands on the rascal who is responsible for the start of the mishap.\"  \"They have found a coin such as we used when as we were in Africa,\" said Dick.  \"I think that furnishes a clew.\"  \"In what way, Rover?\"  \"Those coins were also used by Dan Baxter and Josiah Crabtree.\"  \"And you think one or the other, or both, are in this neighborhood again?\"  \"It looks plausible, doesn't it?\"  \"Yes, but--it would be very strange.  I should think they would give this locality a wide berth.\"  \"Hardly.  Josiah Crabtree isn't done with the Stanhopes, to my mind, and Baxter will get square with us if he can.\"  While this talk was going on Sam and Tom were following some footprints leading from the clearing where the signal board had been found down a small path toward the lake.  The footprints were clearly defined.  \"The prints are not very large,\" observed Tom, as he and his brother measured them.  \"It looks to me as if Dan Baxter's feet might have made them.\"  \"Certainly they weren't made by old Crabtree,\" said Sam.  \"He had a very long foot and always wore square-toed boots.\"  They followed the prints down to the lake shore, and then along the rim of the lake for nearly half a mile.  Here there was a little cove, and under some bushes they discovered some marks in the wet dirt of the bank, as if a rowboat had been moored there.  In this dirt the footprints came to an end.  \"That's the wind-up of this trail,\" sighed Tom.  \"Water leaves no trail.\"  \"That's so.  But supposing we skirt the lake some more.\"  They went on, and did not give up until the declining sun told them the day was done.  When they reached the Hall they found that all of the others had come in, and that preparations were already going forward for the feast in the evening.  For once Captain Putnam and George Strong, his main assistant, were going to allow the cadets to have their own way.  Secretly the captain was tremendously pleased over the showing his pupils had made on the football field, for this happened to be a year when college athletics were in the ascendancy in all of the States.  But the regular evening drill must not be neglected, and soon the sound of the drum was heard, calling the members of companies A and B to the parade ground.  A rush was made for uniforms, swords, and guns, and soon the boys come pouring forth, Dick as a captain, and his two brothers as under officers.  \"Attention!\" shouted the major of the command.  \"Forward! march!\"  \"Boom! boom! boom, boom, boom!\" went the drums, and then the fifers struck up a lively tune, and around the academy marched the two companies at company front.  Then they went around again by column of fours, and then marched into the messroom, where they stacked arms and sat down at the long mess tables.  The movements were patterned after those at West Point, and could not have been improved upon.  \"Well, what of the hunt,\" asked Dick, as soon as he got the chance to talk to Tom.  \"We followed it to the lake and then lost the trail,\" answered his brother.  \"But I am convinced that the rascal was Dan Baxter.\"  \"I believe you are right, Tom,\" answered Dick, and related what Dora Stanhope had told him.  Of course Tom listened with keen interest.  \"We made a mistake in letting old Crabtree and Baxter go when we had them in Africa.  We should have handed them over to the authorities.\"  \"I am not worried about Baxter so much,\" went on Dick.  \"But I hate to think of Crabtree being around to molest the Stanhopes.\"  \"And especially Dora,\" grinned Tom.  \"Right you are, Tom, and I am not ashamed to admit it to you.  But please don't--don't well, make fun of it to me any more.\"  \"I won't, Dick.\"  Tom gave his brother's hand a squeeze under the table.  \"Dora is all right, and if some day I get her for a sister-in-law I won't complain a bit.\" This plain talk made Dick's face flush, but he felt tremendously pleased, nevertheless, and loved Tom more than ever.  Directly after supper the boys were given until eleven o'clock to do as they pleased.  At once some old barrels were piled high at one end of the campus, smeared with tar, stuffed with wood, and set on fire, and the blaze, mounting to the sky, lit up the neighborhood to the lake on one side and the mountains on the other.  Four cadets had gone down to Cedarville to buy the fireworks and the things to eat, and by nine o'clock these returned, loaded down with their purchases.  Among the crowd was Larry Colby, who sought out Dick as soon as he arrived.  \"I've got news,\" he exclaimed.  \"Whom do you suppose I saw down in Cedarville?  Josiah Crabtree!\"  \"You are certain, Larry?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where did you meet him?\"  \"Down at the restaurant where he went for some ice cream.  He was just paying for a lunch he had had when I came in.\"  \"Did you speak to him?\"  \"No; I wanted to do so, but as soon as he saw our crowd coming in he dusted out of a side door.\"  \"Was he alone?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Humph!\" Dick's brow clouded.  He was inclined to think that Dora had been right concerning the noise she had heard on the side porch.  \"You haven't any idea where he went?\"  \"No; I wanted to follow him, but it was dark on the street and he slipped me.\"  This was all Larry had to tell, and he hurried to arrange the fireworks.  The celebration was a grand success, and lasted until almost midnight.  The boys had brought along a lot of Roman candles and skyrockets, and these they set off from the top of one of the tallest trees on the grounds.  \"So that the Pornell fellows can see them,\" said Sam.  \"I know they will enjoy the show,\" and then he closed one eye suggestively.  The Pornell players had chaffed him on account of his size, and now that the victory was won, he did not mean to let them forget their defeat too quickly.  At about ten o'clock Dick went to Captain Putnam and asked permission to leave the grounds for an hour or two.  \"Where do you wish to go?\" asked the captain.  \"To Mrs. Stanhope's, sir,\" and he related what Dora had told him, and of what news Larry Colby had brought.  \"I am afraid you may get into trouble, Rover,\" said the captain seriously.  \"I will be very careful, sir.  I am not afraid of Mr. Crabtree, should he turn up.\"  \"I don't believe you are afraid of anyone,\" said the master with a smile, for he admired Dick's courage.  \"Then you will let me go?\"  \"Wouldn't you rather have somebody with you?\"  \"I wouldn't mind having Tom along.\"  \"I meant some grown person--like, for instance, Mr. Strong.\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Well, then, take Tom.  But mind and be careful, and don't stay too late if everything is right, down there.\"  Having received this permission, Dick hurried to Tom.  Soon the two brothers were on the way, Tom eating some cake and peanuts as they hurried along.  The latter hated to miss the feast, but did not wish to see his brother under take the mission alone.  It was a clear night, and although there was no moon, the stars twinkled overhead like so many diamonds.  Both knew the short cut to Mrs. Stanhope's cottage well, and made rapid progress.  \"Shall you ring the bell if everything appears to be right?\" asked Tom, as they came in sight of the modest dwelling, set in the widow's well-kept garden.  \"I guess not, Tom.  It's so late.  Both Mrs. Stanhope and Dora have probably gone to bed.\"  They had almost reached the gate to the garden when Dick caught his brother by the sleeve and drew him back into the shadow of a large maple tree.  \"What is it, Dick?\"  \"I think I saw somebody moving around the corner of the house just now.\"  Both boys strained their eyes, but could see nothing that resembled a human form.  \"I don't see a thing, Dick.\"  \"Come, we'll move around to the outside of the garden,\" returned the older brother.  The flower garden was not large, and was separated from the vegetable laths.  As they made their way along this, both caught the sound of a window sliding up.  \"Hark!  Did you hear that?\" whispered Dick excitedly.  \"I did.  It came from the back of the house.\"  \"Somebody must be trying to get into the kitchen window!\"  Dick broke into a run, with Tom at his heels.  Entering the garden by a rear gate, they soon reached the vicinity of the kitchen.  A window stood wide open, and through this they beheld somebody inside the apartment with a blazing match in his hand trying to light a candle.  \"Hi, there, who are you?\" cried Tom, before Dick could stop him.  At the sound of the call the man in the kitchen jumped as though stung by a bee.  Then he wheeled around, with the lighted candle in his hand, and both boys saw that it was Josiah Crabtree.     CHAPTER V  A STRUGGLE IN THE DARK   \"Crab"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6071"],["title","The Rover Boys out West; Or, The Search for a Lost Mine (#4)"],["body","tree, you rascal!\" ejaculated Dick.  \"Who--who is that?\" spluttered the former teacher of Putnam Hall, in dismay.  \"It is I--Dick Rover.  What are you doing here?\"  \"I--I came to call upon the Widow Stanhope,\" stammered Josiah Crabtree.  He was so astonished he knew not what to say.  \"You came to rob her, more likely,\" sneered Tom.  \"You just broke in at the window.\"  \"No, no--it--it is all a mistake, Rover.  I--I am stopping here for the night.\"  \"Indeed!\" gasped Dick, almost struck dumb over the man's show of \"nerve,\" as he afterward expressed it.  \"Yes, I am stopping here.\"  \"With Mrs. Stanhope's permission of course.\"  \"Certainly.  How could I stop here otherwise?\"  \"What are you doing in the kitchen all alone?'\"  \"Why, I--er--I was up in my room, but I--er--wanted a glass of water and so came down for it.\"  \"Then Mrs. Stanhope and Dora have gone to bed?\"  \"Yes, they just retired.\"  \"Have you become friends again?\" asked Dick, just to learn what Josiah Crabtree might say.  \"Yes, Rover, Mrs. Stanhope is once more my best friend.\"  \"Then she doesn't know what a rascal you were out in Africa.\"  \"My dear Richard, you are laboring under a great delusion.  I was never in Africa in my life.\"  \"What!\" roared Dick aghast at the man's audacity.  \"I speak the truth.  I have made an investigation, and have learned that somebody went to Africa under my name, just to take advantage of my--ahem--of my exalted rank as a professor.\"  \"Great Scott! how you can draw the long bow!\" murmured Tom.  \"I speak the plain truth.  I can prove that for the past six months I have been in Chicago and other portions of the West.  \"Well, if you are a guest here, just stay with Tom while I call the Stanhopes,\" said Dick, and leaped in at the window.  \"Boy, you shall do nothing of the kind,\" cried Josiah Crabtree, his manner changing instantly.  \"Why not?  If you are friends, it will do no harm.\"  \"Mrs. Stanhope is--er--is not feeling well, and I will not have her disturbed by a headstrong youth like you.\"  \"We'll see about that.  If you--\"  Dick broke off short, for just then a voice he knew well floated down into the kitchen from upstairs.  \"Who is talking down there?  Is that you, Dick?\"  It was Dora speaking, in a voice full of excitement.  \"Yes, Dora, it is I--and Tom.  We have caught Josiah Crabtree here in your kitchen.\"  \"Oh!\"  The girl gave a little scream.  \"What a villain!  Can you hold him?\"  \"We can try,\" answered Dick.  He turned to Crabtree.  \"I reckon your game is up, old man.\"  \"Let me go!\" growled the former teacher fiercely, and as Dick advanced upon him he thrust the lighted candle full into the youth's face.  Of course Dick had to fall back, not wishing to be burnt, and a second later the candle went out leaving the room in total darkness.  But now Tom sprang forward, bearing Crabtree to the floor.  Over and over rolled the pair, upsetting first a chair and then a small table.  At the sound of the row Dora Stanhope began to scream, fearing one of her friends might be killed, and presently Mrs. Stanhope joined in.  But the cottage was situated too far away for any outsiders to hear, so the boys had to fight the battle alone.  At length Josiah Crabtree pulled himself clear of Tom's hold and made for the open window.  But now Dick had recovered and he hurled the man backward.  The movement kept Crabtree in the room, but it was disastrous to Tom, for as the former teacher fell back his heel was planted on Tom's forehead, and for the time being the younger Rover lay stunned and unable to continue the contest.  Finding himself unable to escape by the window, Josiah Crabtree felt his way to the door and ran out into the hall.  Because of his former visits to the house he knew the ground plan well, and from the hall he darted into the parlor and then into the sitting room.  Dick tried to catch him, and once caught his arm.  But Crabtree broke loose and placed a large center table between them.   \"Don't dare to stop me, Rover,\" hissed the man desperately.  \"If you do you will be sorry.  I am armed.\"  \"So am I armed, Josiah Crabtree.  And I call upon you to surrender.\"  \"What, you would shoot me!\" cried the former teacher, in terror.  \"Why not?  Didn't you try to take my life in Africa?\"  \"I repeat, you are mistaken.\"  \"I am not mistaken, and can prove my assertion by half a dozen persons.\"  \"I have not been near Africa.\"  \"I won't argue the point with you.  Do you surrender or not?\"  \"Yes, I will surrender,\" replied Josiah Crabtree meekly.  Yet he did not mean what he said, and as Dick came closer he gave the lad a violent shove backward, which made the elder Rover boy sit down in an easy chair rather suddenly.  Then he darted into a small conservatory attached to the sitting room.  \"Stop!\" panted Dick, catching his breath.  \"Tom, he is running away!\"  Crash! jingle! jingle! jingle!  Josiah Crabtree had tried the door to the conservatory and finding it locked and the key gone, had smashed out some of the glass and leaped through the opening thus afforded.  By this time Dora was coming downstairs, clad in a wrapper and carrying a lamp in her hand.  The first person she met was Tom, who staggered into the hall with his hand to his bruised forehead.  \"Oh, Tom, are you hurt?\" she shrieked.  \"Not much,\" he answered.  \"But Dick--Dick, where are you?\"  \"Here, in the conservatory.  Crabtree just jumped through the glass!\"  Dora ran into the little apartment, which Mrs. Stanhope had just begun to fill with flowers for the coming winter.  Tom came behind her, carrying a poker he had picked up.  \"Is he out of sight?\" asked Tom.  \"Yes, confound the luck,\" replied his brother.  \"Which way did he go?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"We ought to follow him.\"  \"We will.\"  Dick turned to Dora.  \"After we are gone you had better lock up better than ever, and remain on guard until morning.\"  \"I will, Dick,\" she answered.  The key to the conservatory door was hanging on a nearby nail, and taking it down they unlocked the door, and the two boys passed into the darkness of the night outside.  \"Please take care of yourselves!\" cried Dora after them, and then turned to quiet her mother, who had come downstairs in a state of excitement bordering on hysteria, for, as old readers know, Mrs. Stanhope's constitution was a delicate one.  Running into the garden, Dick made out a dim form in the distance, on the path leading to the lake.  \"There he is!\" he cried.  \"Come, Tom, we must catch him, if we can!\"  \"I am with you,\" answered Tom.  \"But take care what you do.  He may be in a desperate frame of mind.\"  \"He is desperate.  But I am not afraid of him,\" returned the elder Rover, with determination.  Josiah Crabtree was running with all the speed of his long legs, and the two lads soon found that they had all they could do to keep him in sight.  \"Stop!\" yelled Tom, at the top of his voice, but to this command the former, teacher paid no attention.  If anything, he ran the faster.  \"He is bound for the lake,\" said Dick.  \"He must have a boat.\"  But Dick was mistaken, for just before the water came into view Josiah Crabtree branched off onto the road leading into Cedarville. Then of a sudden the shadows of a patch of woods hid him from view.  \"He's gone!\" came from Tom, as he slackened his speed.  \"He didn't turn down to the lake.\"  \"That's so.  He must have gone toward Cedarville.\"  The Rover boys came to a halt and looked about them searchingly. On one side of the road lay a tilled field, on the other were rocks and trees and bushes.  They listened intently, but only the occasional cry of a night bird broke the stillness.  \"We are stumped!\" groaned Dick dismally.  \"What, you aren't going to give up the hunt already, are you?\" demanded Tom.  \"No, but where did he go?\"  \"Perhaps he went back to the house.\"  \"I don't believe he would dare to do that.  Besides, what would he go for?\"  \"What made him go in the first place?\"  \"I am sure I don't know.  Perhaps he was going to abduct Dora--or Mrs. Stanhope.\"  \"If he was going to do that alone, he would have had his hands full.\"  The two boys advanced, but with great caution.  They peered into the woods and behind some of the larger rocks, but discovered nothing.  \"That is the second time we have lost our game to-day,\" remarked Tom soberly.  \"First it was Dan Baxter or somebody else, and now it is Josiah Crabtree.\"  \"It must have been Baxter who tried to wreck the stage.  He and old Crabtree always did hang together.\"  \"If they are stopping anywhere in Cedarville we ought to put the police on their track.\"  \"I'll do that sure.  We can easily hold both on half a dozen charges--if we can catch them.\"     CHAPTER VI  AN INTERESTING LETTER   But to catch Josiah Crabtree was not easy.  The former teacher of Putnam Hall was thoroughly alarmed, and once having taken to the woods, he plunged in deeper and deeper, until to find him would have been almost an impossibility.  Indeed, he completely lost himself, and when the boys had left the vicinity he found himself unable to locate the road again, and so had to remain in the cold and damp woods all night, much to his discomfort.  He could not keep warm, and sat chattering on a rock until daylight.  Finding it of no use to continue the search, Dick and Tom retraced their steps to the Stanhope homestead.  They found Dora on guard, with every window and door either locked or nailed up.  The girl had persuaded her feeble mother to lie down again, but Mrs. Stanhope was still too excited to rest comfortably.  \"Did you catch him?\" Dora asked anxiously, after she had admitted them.  \"No, he got away in the darkness,\" answered Dick.  \"It is too bad.  What do you suppose he was up to?\"  \"That is what we would like to find out, Dora.  Certainly he was up to no good.\"  \"Perhaps he wished to rob us.\"  \"He must know that you do not keep much money in the house.\"  \"Day before yesterday mother had me draw four hundred dollars out of the bank, to pay for the new barn we have had built.
