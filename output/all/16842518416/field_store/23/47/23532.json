(#3)"],["body","debating society (where they were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personal friends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politics they differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was a Whig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over some act of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, I think--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I know both of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been glad at any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make the advance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamer for the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United States Senator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed to fill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, as there was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healed the breach between the two, never after reopened.  Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to West Point--that \"he thought I would go\"--there was another very strong inducement.  I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already the best travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, John Walker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated back as soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texas he acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one would form going there now.  I had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve, in Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky, besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole country within fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me the opportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent, Philadelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places were visited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad collision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have received a temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, to enter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face the music.  Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, and has been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There was probably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity could have been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis for President of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any other representative of his party; unless it was immediately after some of John Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a few hours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever they could find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered meals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a far pleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a like service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Union element in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the churches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was preached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the government, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible. There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements for membership in these churches.  Yet this far-off western village, with a population, including old and young, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for the organization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearing arms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel, West Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers of Volunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, all had citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, except possibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from his graduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from other localities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe, Loudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents of Georgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive at the close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had preceded me at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his first engagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point from that village since my time has been graduated.  I took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about the middle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regular trips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length of time, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two or three days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one, drawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  On this occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three days Pittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal to Harrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave a better opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania, and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At that time the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with the comfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be more pleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphia there was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on which I had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over which canal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road from Harrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached. We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, and made the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an hour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days in Philadelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre, visited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), and got reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long. My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to see the city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st of May, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission, without difficulty, very much to my surprise.  A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea of staying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did not expect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic studies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of August came--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt as though I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid to graduation, I would have to remain always.  I did not take hold of my studies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the second time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my room doing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy from which cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted more time to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much of the time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of a trashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's, Marryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many others that I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so that when January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing in that branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the first year's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had been turned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I never succeeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any one study, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery, infantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.  Early in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a bill was discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this an honorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with much interest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I was selfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later, although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to have seen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure a detail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the Academy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some respectable college; but circumstances always did shape my course different from my plans.  At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extending from the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This I enjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out his business in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which my day-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be able to retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve miles away, in the adjoining county of Clermont, and had bought a young horse that had never been in harness, for my special use under the saddle during my furlough.  Most of my time was spent among my old school-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.  Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets is divided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises. These companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent and commandant selecting the officers for their military bearing and qualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelve lieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeants from the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5860"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 1. (#4)"],["body","second, or junior class; and the corporals from the third, or Sophomore class.  I had not been \"called out\" as a corporal, but when I returned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about my standing in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion was too much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by the number of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among the sergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.  During my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, and reviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossal size and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my eyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemble him in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a moment that some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had no intention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-trade ten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in my mind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimate chum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the United States, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impress me with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded General Scott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two men most to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both up to the day of their death.  The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but they still seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last all the examinations were passed, and the members of the class were called upon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I was anxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, but there was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, and attached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were at least four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my first choice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again there was a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for the class were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September. Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; and again I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besides a horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physical condition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  For six months before graduation I had had a desperate cough (\"Tyler's grip\" it was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundred and seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown six inches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in my father's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, which made my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next younger than myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and I seemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.  Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service with different uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of my assignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not to make the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantry or dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then it took at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor and two more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a time of great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how it looked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls, to see me in it.  The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances that happened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distaste for military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after the arrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati on horseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imagining that every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when I first saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirty and ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's what suspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tub for weeks, turned to me and cried:  \"Soldier! will you work?  No, sir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!\" The horse trade and its dire consequences were recalled to mind.  The other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethel stood the old stage tavern where \"man and beast\" found accommodation, The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  On my return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable, barefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the color of my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed down the outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in the mind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did not appreciate it so highly.  During the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent in visiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally other towns in that part of the State.    CHAPTER III.  ARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.  On the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest military post in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companies of infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th. Colonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commanded the post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, but without vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call had to be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoy themselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, without making written application to state where they were going for how long, etc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, in my early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they came to command posts, made it a study to think what orders they could publish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  I noticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out, that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of disabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service. They had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; but they did not always give their disease the right name.  At West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he was room-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west of Jefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at home at that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle and bridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dent estate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent. There were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a school miss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still an older daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years at boarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had not yet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city with connections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St. Louis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I do not know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did become more enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visit the neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity. Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of the younger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks it is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued for some years without my finding out that there was anything serious the matter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred which developed my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.  The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violent discussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  The administration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the most strenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the great and absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greater part of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, which had been dismounted a year or two before, and designated \"Dismounted Rifles\"--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five miles east of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of May the 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to go into camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await further orders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way down the Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order. About the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twenty days to go to Ohio to visit my parents.  I was obliged to go to St. Louis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati, or the first steamer going up the Ohio River to any point.  Before I left St. Louis orders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the 4th infantry to follow the 3d.  A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving; but before he could reach me I was off, totally ignorant of these events.  A day or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from a classmate and fellow lieutenant in the 4th, informing me of the circumstances related above, and advising me not to open any letter post marked St. Louis or Jefferson Barracks, until the expiration of my leave, and saying that he would pack up my things"]]]
