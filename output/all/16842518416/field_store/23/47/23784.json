He has power over all\" (Sermon at Nauvoo, April 8th, 1843, Hist, of the Church, Vol. V, p. 340.) And as I have said elsewhere: This Mighty Intelligence, who is \"more intelligent than All\" is also the All-Wise One; the All-Powerful One! What he tells other Intelligences to do must be precisely the wisest, fittest thing that they could anywhere or anyhow learn--the thing which it will in all ways behoove them with right loyal thankfulness, and nothing doubting, to do. There goes with this, too, the thought that this All-Wise One is the Un-Selfish One, the All-Loving One, the One who desires that which is highest, and best; not for Himself alone, but for all; and that, too, will be best for Him. His glory, His power, His joy will be enhanced by the uplifting of all, by enlarging them; by increasing their joy, power, and glory. And because this Most-Intelligent One is all this, and does all this, the other Intelligencies worship Him, submit their judgments and their will to His judgment and His will. He knows, and can do that which is best; and this submission of the mind to the most Intelligent, Wisest--wiser than All--is worship. This is the whole meaning of the doctrine and the life of the Christ expressed in--\"Father, not my will but Thy will, be done.\"  _3. The Capacity of Intelligences for Progress:_ If what has been set forth as to the qualities, or attributes of Intelligences be true--that they are conscious of self and of not self; that they have powers of perception, comparison, deliberation, reason, judgment, imagination and volition, (See Lesson I, this treatise) then they have in them the inherent elements of progress. All they need with this inherent equipment for progress is proper environment and action, and the guidance of the Highest Intelligence; at least it must be admitted, as to the last, that progress would be more sure, more rapid when so guided.  _4. Purpose in the Earth-Life of Man:_ To provide the means and opportunity for progress the earth-life of man was planned. As God stood among the Intelligences, he said to those that were with him:      \"We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of     these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;     and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things     whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; and they who keep     their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their     first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those     who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate     shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Book of Abraham, Ch. iii:24-26.]  That is, interpreting the closing declaration, they shall have the blessings of eternal progress. Progress, then, is the purpose for which the earth life of man was planned--that Intelligences might be \"added upon,\" and that eternally.  \"This is my work and my glory,\" says the Lord, \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man;\" (Book of Moses, Ch. i:39, Pearl of Great Price). That is of man _as_ man. Not the immortality of the personal Intelligence or spirit of man, for that is already assured; but the immortality of the spirit and body in their united condition, and which together constitute \"man;\" or the soul, for, in the revelations of God in this last dispensation, the spirit and the body are said to be the \"soul:\" \"Through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. And the spirit and the body is the soul of man. And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 88:14-16).  Again, \"Men are that they might have joy,\" said the Prophet Lehi.[A] \"Men are that they might have joy!\" Have we here the reappearance of the old Epicurean doctrine, \"pleasure is the supreme good, and chief end of life?\" No, verily! Nor any other form of old \"hedonism\"--the Greek ethics of gross self-interest. For mark, in the first place, the different words \"joy\" and \"pleasure.\" They are not synonymous. The first does not necessarily arise from the second, \"joy\" may arise from quite other sources than \"pleasure;\" from pain, even, when the endurance of pain is to eventuate in the achievement of some good: such as the travail of a mother in bringing forth her offspring; the weariness and pain and danger of toil by a father, to secure comforts for loved ones. Nor is the \"joy\" here contemplated the \"joy\" of mere innocence--mere innocence, which say what you will of it, is but a negative sort of virtue. A virtue that is colorless, never quite sure of itself, always more or less uncertain, because untried. Such a virtue--if mere absence of vice may be called virtue--would be unproductive of that \"joy\" the attainment of which is set forth in the Book of Mormon as the purpose of man's existence; for in the context it is written, \"They [Adam and Eve] would have remained in a state of 'innocence.' Having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.\" From which it appears that the \"joy\" contemplated in our Book of Mormon passage is to arise from something more than mere innocence, which is, impliedly, unproductive of \"joy.\" The \"joy\" contemplated in the Book of Mormon passage is to arise out of man's knowledge of evil, of sin; through knowing misery, sorrow, pain and suffering; through seeing good and evil locked in awful conflict; through a consciousness of having chosen in that conflict the better part, the good; and not only in having chosen it, but in having wedded it by eternal compact; made it his by right of conquest over evil. It is a \"joy\" that will arise from a consciousness of having \"fought the good fight,\" of having \"kept the faith.\" It will arises from a consciousness of moral, spiritual and physical strength. Of strength gained in conflict. The strength that comes from experience; from having sounded the depths of the soul; from experiencing all emotions of which mind is susceptible; from testing all the qualities and strength of the intellect. A \"joy\" that will come to man from a contemplation of the universe, and a consciousness that he is an heir to all that is--a joint heir with Jesus Christ and God; from knowing that he is an essential part of all that is. It is a joy that will be born of the consciousness of existence itself--that will revel in existence--in thoughts of and realizations of existence's limitless possibilities. A \"joy\" born of the consciousness of the power of eternal increase. A \"joy\" arising from association with the Intelligences of innumerable heavens--the Gods of all eternities. A \"joy\" born of a consciousness of being, of intelligence, of faith, knowledge, light, truth, mercy, justice, love, glory, dominion, wisdom, power; all feelings, affections, emotions, passions; all heights and all depths! \"Men are that they might have joy;\" and that \"joy\" is based upon and contemplates all that is here set down. (New Witnesses, Vol. III, pp. 199-120.)  [Footnote A: II Nephi ii:25.]  The foregoing considerations discover the purpose of God in the earth-life of man to be the progress and joy of men, kindred Intelligences with God; and with that progress and joy of kindred Intelligences, there must be an ever widening manifestation of the glory of God. \"The glory of God is Intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 93:36); but not \"Intelligence\" only as it inheres in Himself; but also as it finds expression and development in others.  _5. A Union of Spirit and Element Essential to a Fulness of Joy:_ In this progress of Intelligences there must be movement, action, new environment, estates, experiences through which they pass.--Hence Intelligences are begotten spirits, and spirits are begotten men--the \"deathless element\"--Intelligence--must be united with earth-element, to learn what earth-life has to teach, and get itself expressed through earth-elements; which also--so far as such elements shall be essential to an added dignity and power to the spirit of man--will be made immortal, become an indissoluble part of the spiritual personage, the spirit and the body thus inseparably united constituting the \"_soul_ of man.\"[A] \"Man is spirit.\"[B] \"The elements\"--earth elements--\"are eternal; and spirit and element, inseparably connected receive a fullness of joy; and when separated man cannot receive a fullness of joy.\" Hence for man, earth-existence became a necessity to progress, and therefore it was provided.  [Footnote A: \"Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. And the spirit and the body is the soul of man. And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul;\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 88, verses 14, 15, 16).]  [Footnote B: Doc. & Cov. Sec. 93:33, 34.]    LESSON V.  (Scripture Reading Exercise.)

Running throughout the Hebrew scriptures, but more or less vague, there are traces of the pre-earth existence of intelligences, and of strife and struggle in that existence; rebellion and war; failure of certain ones to keep first estates, their being cast out and reserved in chains of darkness to some future day of judgment; some reference also to eternal life that was promised of God before the world was made. Though these lack somewhat in clearness, let me, if they may not be set forth in anything like order, at least mass them, that they may be before us in one view.  _2. The Hebrew Scriptures on the War in Heaven:_ In the very beginning of the Hebrew scripture God, in the creation, is represented as addressing others engaged with him in the creation work: \"And God said let us make man in _our_ image, after _our_ likeness.\"[A] Then after the Fall: \"And the Lord God said: Behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil.\"[B] Perfectly blending with this idea of a plurality of divine Intelligences engaging in the work of creation is the Lord's question to Job: \"Gird up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me: Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof, _when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\"_[C]  [Footnote A: Gen. i:26.]  [Footnote B: Gen. iii:22.]  [Footnote C: Job xxxviii:4-7.]  It seems, then, that there were sons of God before the foundations of the earth were laid, or even the measuring line was stretched upon it. And may it not have been these Sons of God, whom God addressed in the creation work, saying to them: \"Let us make man in our image\"--\"The man has become as one of us?\"  On the return of the Seventy whom Jesus sent out on a special mission into every city and place where he himself proposed to go, they said: \"Lord, even the devils are subject to us in thy name.\" To which Jesus answered: \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" (Luke x:17, 18). As if he would say, \"Your victory over evil spirits in my name, is not the first I have won over Satan. I saw him as lightning fall from heaven.\"[A] One other reference to Lucifer in this same connection is made by the Christ; when addressing contentious Jews, he said: \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.\"[B]  [Footnote A: There is much confusion among the commentators on this passage c. f. Jamieson--Fausset-Brown with the International Revision Commentary on the passage. Dummelow's Commentary, however, says: \"Our Lord poetically compares Satan's discomfiture at the successful mission of the Seventy, to his original fall from heaven.\" He also regards John viii:44, as referring to the same event.]  [Footnote B: St. John viii:44.]  In the Book of Revelation, however, and also in Jude, this \"war in heaven\" is more minutely described. In the former it is said:      \"And there was a war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought     against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and     prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.     And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the     Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out     into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard     a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength,     and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the     accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our     God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,     and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives     unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in     them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the     devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth     that he hath but a short time.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Rev. xii:7-12.]  And this from Jude: \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day\" (Jude 6). Peter also alludes to this event when he says: \"God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment\" (II Peter ii:4).[A]  [Footnote A: It is upon these declarations of Scripture that Milton has based his gorgeous epic, \"Paradise Lost.\"]  _2. Modern Scriptures on the War in Heaven:_ These are the scripture passages which I said in a vague way represent both the pre-earth existence of Intelligences, and a state of strife, struggle, rebellion, war; attended with the loss of \"first estate,\" and place in heaven, being thrust out into outer darkness. But what the point of controversy, the cause of difference upon which the \"war\" was based--all this we are left in ignorance of in these scriptures; and even in those other scriptures yet to be quoted, the brevity is painful, and yet they shed great light upon conditions that one feels must have existed in heaven, from the passages of Hebrew scripture massed above. In the Doctrine and Covenants occurs the following passage:      \"Behold, the Devil was before Adam [speaking of Adam in the Garden     of Eden, and of his temptation], for he rebelled against me, saying     give me thine honor, which is my power; also a third part of the     hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;     and they were thrust down and became the Devil and his angels. And     behold there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which     place is hell.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov., Sec. 29:36-38.]  Again, in the revelation called the \"Vision,\" or \"Vision of the Three Glories,\" the Prophet says:      \"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who     was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the     Only Begotten Son, whom the Father loved, and who was in the bosom     of the Father--was thrust down from the presence of God and the     Son. And was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him--he     was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld and lo, he is     fallen! is fallen! even a son of the morning. And while we were     yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the     vision, for we beheld Satan, that old serpent--even the Devil--who     rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God,     and his Christ.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov., Sec. 76:25-38.]  The Book of Abraham, after representing God's purpose to create an earth in order that the Intelligences in the midst of whom he dwelt might have earth-existence, and be put in the way of eternal progress (Ch. iii:24, 26), then asks: \"Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first. And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him\" (Book of Abraham, Ch. iii:27-28).  Again in the Book of Moses (Pearl of Great Price), after detailing an experience which Moses had with Satan, the Lord said to him:      \"That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only     Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came     before me, saying: Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son,     and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and     surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. But, behold, my     beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning,     said unto me, Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine     forever. Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and     sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had     given him, and also that I should give unto him mine own power; by     the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast     down; and he became Satan, yea, even the Devil, the father of all     lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his     will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Book of Moses iv:1-4.]  This last passage from the Book of Abraham discloses the important truth that this war in heaven was connected with a controversy concerning the redemption of man from conditions in which, apparently, the contemplated earth-life would involve him. The controversy concerned also the choice of One to perform this work of redemption. Two offered themselves, but the terms of one involved at least the sacrifice of two mighty principles; one, the agency of man; the other, the honor and glory of God. \"Here am I, Father, send me,\" said the Christ. Then Lucifer--the Light Bearer, and \"one in authority in the presence of God\"--said: \"Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy Son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.\" But the first spake again, saying,[A] \"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.\" Whereupon the election fell upon the Christ, and Lucifer rebelled.
