There, Lady Clara, now you know it all.\"  The manner in which he made his declaration to her was almost fierce in its energy. He had stopped in the pathway, and she, unconscious of what she was doing, almost unconscious of what she was hearing, had stopped also. The mare, taking advantage of the occasion, was cropping the grass close to them. And so, for a few seconds, they stood in silence.  \"Am I so bold, Lady Clara,\" said he, when those few seconds had gone by--\"Am I so bold that I may hope for no answer?\" But still she said nothing. In lieu of speaking she uttered a long sigh; and then Fitzgerald could hear that she was sobbing.  \"Oh, Clara, I love you so fondly, so dearly, so truly!\" said he in an altered voice and with sweet tenderness. \"I know my own presumption in thus speaking. I know and feel bitterly the difference in our rank.\"  \"I--care--nothing--for rank,\" said the poor girl, sobbing through her tears. He was generous, and she at any rate would not be less so. No; at that moment, with her scanty seventeen years of experience, with her ignorance of all that the world had in it of grand and great, of high and rich, she did care nothing for rank. That Owen Fitzgerald was a gentleman of good lineage, fit to mate with a lady, that she did know; for her mother, who was a proud woman, delighted to have him in her presence. Beyond this she cared for none of the conventionalities of life. Rank! If she waited for rank, where was she to look for friends who would love her? Earls and countesses, barons and their baronesses, were scarce there where fate had placed her, under the shadow of the bleak mountains of Muskerry. Her want, her undefined want, was that some one should love her. Of all men and women whom she had hitherto known, this Owen Fitzgerald was the brightest, the kindest, the gentlest in his manner, the most pleasant to look on. And now he was there at her feet, swearing that he loved her;--and then drawing back as it were in dread of her rank. What did she care for rank?  \"Clara, Clara, my Clara! Can you learn to love me?\"  She had made her one little effort at speaking when she attempted to repudiate the pedestal on which he affected to place her; but after that she could for a while say no more. But she still sobbed, and still kept her eyes fixed upon the ground.  \"Clara, say one word to me. Say that you do not hate me.\" But just at that moment she had not one word to say.  \"If you will bid me do so, I will leave this country altogether. I will go away, and I shall not much care whither. I can only stay now on condition of your loving me. I have thought of this day for the last year past, and now it has come.\"  Every word that he now spoke was gospel to her. Is it not always so,--should it not be so always, when love first speaks to loving ears? What! he had loved her for that whole twelvemonth that she had known him; loved her in those days when she had been wont to look up into his face, wondering why he was so nice, so much nicer than any one else that came near her! A year was a great deal to her; and had he loved her through all those days? and after that should she banish him from her house, turn him away from his home, and drive him forth unhappy and wretched? Ah, no! She could not be so unkind to him;--she could not be so unkind to her own heart. But still she sobbed; and still she said nothing.  In the mean time they had turned, and were now walking back towards the house, the gentle-natured mare still following at their heels. They were walking slowly--very slowly back--just creeping along the path, when they saw Lady Desmond and her son coming to meet them on the road.  \"There is your mother, Clara. Say one word to me before we meet them.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald; I am so frightened. What will mamma say?\"  \"Say about what? As yet I do not know what she may have to say. But before we meet her, may I not hope to know what her daughter will say? Answer me this, Clara. Can you, will you love me?\"  There was still a pause, a moment's pause, and then some sound did fall from her lips. But yet it was so soft, so gentle, so slight, that it could hardly be said to reach even a lover's ear. Fitzgerald, however, made the most of it. Whether it were Yes, or whether it were No, he took it as being favourable, and Lady Clara Desmond gave him no sign to show that he was mistaken.  \"My own, own, only loved one,\" he said, embracing her as it were with his words, since the presence of her approaching mother forbade him even to take her hand in his, \"I am happy now, whatever may occur; whatever others may say; for I know that you will be true to me. And remember this--whatever others may say, I also will be true to you. You will think of that, will you not, love?\"  This time she did answer him, almost audibly. \"Yes,\" she said. And then she devoted herself to a vain endeavour to remove the traces of her tears before her mother should be close to them.  Fitzgerald at once saw that such endeavour must be vain. At one time he had thought of turning away, and pretending that they had not seen the countess. But he knew that Clara would not be able to carry out any such pretence; and he reflected also that it might be just as well that Lady Desmond should know the whole at once. That she would know it, and know it soon, he was quite sure. She could learn it not only from Clara, but from himself. He could not now be there at the house without showing that he both loved and knew that he was beloved. And then why should Lady Desmond not know it? Why should he think that she would set herself against the match? He had certainly spoken to Clara of the difference in their rank; but, after all, it was no uncommon thing for an earl's daughter to marry a commoner. And in this case the earl's daughter was portionless, and the lover desired no portion. Owen Fitzgerald at any rate might boast that he was true and generous in his love.  So he plucked up his courage, and walked on with a smiling face to meet Lady Desmond and her son; while poor Clara crept beside him with eyes downcast, and in an agony of terror.  Lady Desmond had not left the house with any apprehension that there was aught amiss. Her son had told her that Owen had gone off \"to do the civil to Clara;\" and as he did not come to the house within some twenty minutes after this, she had proposed that they would go and meet him.  \"Did you tell him that I wanted him?\" said the countess.  \"Oh, yes, I did; and he is coming, only he would go away to Clara.\"  \"Then I shall scold him for his want of gallantry,\" said Lady Desmond, laughing, as they walked out together from beneath the huge portal.  But as soon as she was near enough to see the manner of their gait, as they slowly came on towards her, her woman's tact told her that something was wrong;--and whispered to her also what might too probably be the nature of that something. Could it be possible, she asked herself, that such a man as Owen Fitzgerald should fall in love with such a girl as her daughter Clara?  \"What shall I say to mamma?\" whispered Clara to him, as they all drew near together.  \"Tell her everything.\"  \"But, Patrick--\"  \"I will take him off with me if I can.\" And then they were all together, standing in the road.  \"I was coming to obey your behests, Lady Desmond,\" said Fitzgerald, trying to look and speak as though he were at his ease.  \"Coming rather tardily, I think,\" said her ladyship, not altogether playfully.  \"I told him you wanted him, as we were crossing to the house,\" said the earl. \"Didn't I, Owen?\"  \"Is anything the matter with Clara?\" said Lady Desmond, looking at her daughter.  \"No, mamma,\" said Clara; and she instantly began to sob and cry.  \"What is it, sir?\" And as she asked she turned to Fitzgerald; and her manner now at least had in it nothing playful.  \"Lady Clara is nervous and hysterical. The excitement of the ball has perhaps been too much for her. I think, Lady Desmond, if you were to take her in with you it would be well.\"  Lady Desmond looked up at him; and he then saw, for the first time, that she could if she pleased look very stern. Hitherto her face had always worn smiles, had at any rate always been pleasing when he had seen it. He had never been intimate with her, never intimate enough to care what her face was like, till that day when he had carried her son up from the hall door to his room. Then her countenance had been all anxiety for her darling; and afterwards it had been all sweetness for her darling's friend. From that day to this present one, Lady Desmond had ever given him her sweetest smiles.  But Fitzgerald was not a man to be cowed by any woman's looks. He met hers by a full, front face in return. He did not allow his eye for a moment to fall before hers. And yet he did not look at her haughtily, or with defiance, but with an aspect which showed that he was ashamed of nothing that he had done,--whether he had done anything that he ought to be ashamed of or no.  \"Clara,\" said the countess, in a voice which fell with awful severity on the poor girl's ears, \"you had better return to the house with me.\"  \"Yes, mamma.\"  \"And shall I wait on you to-morrow, Lady Desmond?\" said Fitzgerald, in a tone which seemed to the countess to be, in the present state of affairs, almost impertinent. The man had certainly been misbehaving himself; and yet there was not about him the slightest symptom of shame.  \"Yes; no,\" said the countess. \"That is, I will write a note to you if it be necessary. Good morning.\"  \"Good-bye, Lady Desmond,\" said Owen. And as he took off his hat with his left hand, he put out his right to shake hands with her, as was customary with him. Lady Desmond was at first inclined to refuse the courtesy; but she either thought better of such intention, or else she had not courage to maintain it; for at parting she did give him her hand.  \"Good-bye, Lady Clara;\" and he also shook hands with her, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5897"],["title","Castle Richmond (#7)"],["body"," need hardly be said that there was a lover's pressure in the grasp.  \"Good-bye,\" said Clara, through her tears, in the saddest, soberest tone. He was going away, happy, light hearted, with nothing to trouble him. But she had to encounter that fearful task of telling her own crime. She had to depart with her mother;--her mother, who, though never absolutely unkind, had so rarely been tender with her. And then her brother--!  \"Desmond,\" said Fitzgerald, \"walk as far as the lodge with me like a good fellow. I have something that I want to say to you.\"  The mother thought for a moment that she would call her son back; but then she bethought herself that she also might as well be without him. So the young earl, showing plainly by his eyes that he knew that much was the matter, went back with Fitzgerald towards the lodge.  \"What is it you have done now?\" said the earl. The boy had some sort of an idea that the offence committed was with reference to his sister; and his tone was hardly as gracious as was usual with him.  This want of kindliness at the present moment grated on Owen's ears; but he resolved at once to tell the whole story out, and then leave it to the earl to take it in dudgeon or in brotherly friendship as he might please.  \"Desmond,\" said he, \"can you not guess what has passed between me and your sister?\"  \"I am not good at guessing,\" he answered, brusquely.  \"I have told her that I loved her, and would have her for my wife; and I have asked her to love me in return.\"  There was an open manliness about this which almost disarmed the earl's anger. He had felt a strong attachment to Fitzgerald, and was very unwilling to give up his friendship; but, nevertheless, he had an idea that it was presumption on the part of Mr. Fitzgerald of Hap House to look up to his sister. Between himself and Owen the earl's coronet never weighed a feather; he could not have abandoned his boy's heart to the man's fellowship more thoroughly had that man been an earl as well as himself. But he could not get over the feeling that Fitzgerald's worldly position was beneath that of his sister;--that such a marriage on his sister's part would be a mesalliance. Doubting, therefore, and in some sort dismayed--and in some sort also angry--he did not at once give any reply.  \"Well, Desmond, what have you to say to it? You are the head of her family, and young as you are, it is right that I should tell you.\"  \"Tell me! of course you ought to tell me. I don't see what youngness has to do with it. What did she say?\"  \"Well, she said but little; and a man should never boast that a lady has favoured him. But she did not reject me.\" He paused a moment, and then added, \"After all, honesty and truth are the best. I have reason to think that she loves me.\"  The poor young lord felt that he had a double duty, and hardly knew how to perform it. He owed a duty to his sister which was paramount to all others; but then he owed a duty also to the friend who had been so kind to him. He did not know how to turn round upon him and tell him that he was not fit to marry his sister.  \"And what do you say to it, Desmond?\"  \"I hardly know what to say. It would be a very bad match for her. You, you know, are a capital fellow; the best fellow going. There is nobody about anywhere that I like so much.\"  \"In thinking of your sister, you should put that out of the question.\"  \"Yes; that's just it. I like you for a friend better than any one else. But Clara ought--ought--ought--\"  \"Ought to look higher, you would say.\"  \"Yes; that's just what I mean. I don't want to offend you, you know.\"  \"Desmond, my boy, I like you the better for it. You are a fine fellow, and I thoroughly respect you. But let us talk sensibly about this. Though your sister's rank is high--\"  \"Oh, I don't want to talk about rank. That's all bosh, and I don't care about it. But Hap House is a small place, and Clara wouldn't be doing well; and what's more, I am quite sure the countess will not hear of it.\"  \"You won't approve then?\"  \"No, I can't say I will.\"  \"Well, that is honest of you. I am very glad that I have told you at once. Clara will tell her mother, and at any rate there will be no secrets. Good-bye, old fellow.\"  \"Good-bye,\" said the earl. Then they shook hands, and Fitzgerald rode off towards Hap House. Lord Desmond pondered over the matter some time, standing alone near the lodge; and then walked slowly back towards the mansion. He had said that rank was all bosh; and in so saying had at the moment spoken out generously the feelings of his heart. But that feeling regarded himself rather than his sister; and if properly analyzed would merely have signified that, though proud enough of his own rank, he did not require that his friends should be of the same standing. But as regarded his sister, he certainly would not be well pleased to see her marry a small squire with a small income.     CHAPTER IV.  THE COUNTESS.   The countess, as she walked back with her daughter towards the house, had to bethink herself for a minute or two as to how she should act, and what she would say. She knew, she felt that she knew, what had occurred. If her daughter's manner had not told her, the downcast eyes, the repressed sobs, the mingled look of shame and fear;--if she had not read the truth from these, she would have learned it from the tone of Fitzgerald's voice, and the look of triumph which sat upon his countenance.  And then she wondered that this should be so, seeing that she had still regarded Clara as being in all things a child; and as she thought further, she wondered at her own fatuity, in that she had allowed herself to be so grossly deceived.  \"Clara,\" said she, \"what is all this?\"  \"Oh, mamma!\"  \"You had better come on to the house, my dear, and speak to me there. In the mean time, collect your thoughts, and remember this, Clara, that you have the honour of a great family to maintain.\"  Poor Clara! what had the great family done for her, or how had she been taught to maintain its honour? She knew that she was an earl's daughter, and that people called her Lady Clara; whereas other young ladies were only called Miss So-and-So. But she had not been taught to separate herself from the ordinary throng of young ladies by any other distinction. Her great family had done nothing special for her, nor placed before her for example any grandly noble deeds. At that old house at Desmond Court company was scarce, money was scarce, servants were scarce. She had been confided to the care of a very ordinary governess; and if there was about her anything that was great or good, it was intrinsically her own, and by no means due to intrinsic advantages derived from her grand family. Why should she not give what was so entirely her own to one whom she loved, to one by whom it so pleased her to be loved?  And then they entered the house, and Clara followed her mother to the countess's own small up-stairs sitting-room. The daughter did not ordinarily share this room with her mother, and when she entered it, she seldom did so with pleasurable emotion. At the present moment she had hardly strength to close the door after her.  \"And now, Clara, what is all this?\" said the countess, sitting down in her accustomed chair.  \"All which, mamma?\" Can any one blame her in that she so far equivocated?  \"Clara, you know very well what I mean. What has there been between you and Mr. Fitzgerald?\"  The guilt-stricken wretch sat silent for a while, sustaining the scrutiny of her mother's gaze; and then falling from her chair on to her knees, she hid her face in her mother's lap, exclaiming, \"Oh, mamma, mamma, do not look at me like that!\"  Lady Desmond's heart was somewhat softened by this appeal; nor would I have it thought that she was a cruel woman, or an unnatural mother. It had not been her lot to make an absolute, dearest, heartiest friend of her daughter, as some mothers do; a friend between whom and herself there should be, nay could be, no secrets. She could not become young again in sharing the romance of her daughter's love, in enjoying the gaieties of her daughter's balls, in planning dresses, amusements, and triumphs with her child. Some mothers can do this; and they, I think, are the mothers who enjoy most fully the delights of maternity. This was not the case with Lady Desmond; but yet she loved her child, and would have made any reasonable sacrifice for what she regarded as that child's welfare.  \"But, my dear,\" she said, in a softened tone, \"you must tell me what has occurred. Do you not know that it is my duty to ask, and yours to tell me? It cannot be right that there should be any secret understanding between yourself and Mr. Fitzgerald. You know that, Clara, do you not?\"  \"Yes, mamma,\" said Clara, remembering that her lover had bade her tell her mother everything.  \"Well, my love?\"  Clara's story was very simple, and did not, in fact, want any telling. It was merely the old well-worn tale, so common through all the world. \"He had laughed on the lass with his bonny black eye!\" and she,--she was ready to go \"to the mountain to hear a love-tale!\" One may say that an occurrence so very common could not want much telling.  \"Mamma; he says--\"  \"Well, my dear?\"  \"He says--. Oh, mamma! I could not help it.\"  \"No, Clara; you certainly could not help what he might say to you. You could not refuse to listen to him. A lady in such a case, when she is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman, as you were with Mr. Fitzgerald, is bound to listen to him, and to give him an answer. You could not help what he might say, Clara. The question now is, what answer did you give to what he said?\"  Clara, who was still kneeling, looked up piteously into her mother's face, sighed bitterly, but said nothing.  \"He told you that he loved you, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, mamma.\"  \"And I suppose you gave him some answer? Eh! my dear?\"  The answer to this was another long sigh.  \"But, Clara, you must tell me. It is absolutely necessary that I"]]]
