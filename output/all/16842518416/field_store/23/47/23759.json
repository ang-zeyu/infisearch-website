Both the reading and the appropriateness of the scriptures chosen should be subject to the criticism of the teacher at the time. Correct pronunciation should be taught and insisted upon and practiced until it shall become habitual. From the selections read before the class, and the suggestions from the teachers the readings will elicit, each member in time will be able to build up a fine list of chapters or parts of chapters that will be suitable for family worship and special reading. It is not expected that this exercise will occupy more than ten minutes, and usually should not occupy more than five. An example of such reading exercise is given in Lesson XIV, Part II.  The object of publishing a special text with each lesson, is to bring before the members of the class passages of striking beauty, doctrinal value, or of spiritual power; both that our Seventies may in this way gradually build up a collection of striking texts, and also that they themselves may form the habit while reading, of noting such passages and making them their own. They will find the noting of such passages a very fruitful and successful means of enriching their own language and enlarging their powers of expression.  _LECTURES_.  Occasionally special lectures and papers are outlined in the lesson. Teachers should make assignments of these exercises two or three weeks before the time for them to be rendered, that there may be ample time for thorough preparation, with the view of making the lectures and papers an intellectual treat to the quorums.  _SUBJECTS OF PRESENT DAY INTEREST_.  In the latter half of the course for the present year, subjects of present day interest are introduced to give variety to, and increase the interest in the lessons. It is suggested that these subjects be treated by having extemporaneous speaking upon the various topics in them. That is to say, let the subject be announced a week in advance for general consideration by all the members of the quorum. Then when assembled, the teacher conducting the exercise should call upon the members without previous notice or warning to speak on some subdivision or special topic associated with the subject matter of the lesson. The notes in these lessons comprise suggestions as to the construction of speeches or lectures, and these should be considered and enlarged upon, as the notes are only hints in the direction of helpfulness to the young and inexperienced members of the class. The purpose of introducing these subjects of present day interest is that the members of the quorums may be trained a little in applying the revealed principles of the Gospel to our present day problems, which to know how to do, and to do it well, is a matter of first rate importance.  Neither in these extemporaneous exercises nor in any other of the lessons should excuses or hesitancy be tolerated. No member should be allowed to refuse to make the effort to speak. Strict class discipline should be maintained all along the line. We are dealing with men, not children; and, moreover, with men who of their own volition and desire have accepted the office of Seventy, and are under the deepest moral obligation to bend every energy to qualify themselves for the high duties pertaining to their office, and therefore should be thoroughly in earnest in these class exercises, and in home study and preparation. No foolish pride that shrinks from revealing one's ignorance or lack of training or ability should stand in the way of taking an active part in class work. He who would make progress in knowledge and the training of mind faculties and polite and graceful deportment, must know that a humble attitude of mind that submits to correction and suggestion, are conditions precedent to that progress. We assemble in quorum capacity for this training. Our quorums are to become our workshops for the education of men, and each should manifest the willingness to try, and no matter how complete the failure or how often it is repeated there should be promptness and thoroughness and earnestness of effort and willingness to try again whenever a member is called upon to take part in class work.  _CLASS CRITICS_.  Class critics may be appointed to criticize in kindness and in fairness, but frankly and honestly, the class exercises; not necessarily confining their criticism to defects alone. Excellence may be noted and moderately praised, but benefits will naturally arise chiefly from having defects in matter and manner pointed out to the member rendering an exercise, such as awkwardness in bearing, unsuitableness of phraseology, wrong use of words, errors in grammar, mispronunciation of words, misconceptions in ideas, defects in logical treatment, inappropriateness of illustration--let all such things be subjects for fair but frank criticism, and submitted to willingly and in good part, for purposes of improvement, and beyond a doubt such criticism would be very helpful.  If the suggestion of the appointment of the critic be acted upon, a different one should be appointed, say every month, or not less seldom than every two months.  _OPENING EXERCISES_.  It will be observed that no suggestions are made in the lessons in relation to opening exercises. It was thought unnecessary to make any since that can be easily managed as each quorum deems proper. We do suggest, however, that singing be made part of such exercise; both on account of its being a very beautiful and appropriate exercise for such meetings as we propose our quorum class meetings to become, and also for the reason that singing is a training that our Elders very much need to equip them for their mission work. All, therefore, should be induced to participate in this exercise to the extent of their abilities. Occasionally ten or fifteen minutes could be devoted to practice in singing--right good earnest work, until each quorum builds up a repertoire of suitable hymns and spiritual songs. It is quite possible, too, for nearly every quorum to have a fine quartette or male chorus, and occasionally these could render special pieces to enliven the meetings and make glad the hearts of the brethren, but not to the displacement of congregational or quorum singing.  And in the selection of hymns and songs, and choruses, appropriateness should be carefully considered. Let the strong, stalwart hymns of the present dispensation be practiced in the quorums, and not the namby, pamby, childish hymns that sometimes find their way into the repertoire of songs sung by our Elders in the mission field. Let us have such hymns as,    \"The morning breaks, the shadows flee;      Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled!   The dawning of a brighter day      Majestic rises on the world.\"  A trumpet blast within itself. Such hymns as,    \"An angel from on high,      The long, long silence broke,\" etc.  Also,    \"Israel, Israel, God is calling,      Calling thee from lands of woe,\" etc.  Also,    \"If you could hie to Kolob.         In the twinkling of an eye,\" etc.  Also,    \"O say, what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest gem,\" etc.  Also,    \"Israel, awake from your long silent slumber!     Shake off the fetters that bound thee so long,\" etc.  These few indicate a class of our hymns that are peculiarly ours--peculiarly Mormon hymns that are vibrant with the spirit of the latter-day work because it produced them--inspired them, and they are more appropriate, at least for Seventies, for missionaries, than the half sectarian songs many of our youth are learning to cultivate a taste for. Let us learn to sing Mormonism as well as to preach it. Every Elder who can sing at all should carefully select a set of hymns that have the missionary spirit in them and learn to sing them.  _PRAYER_.  A word on prayer. If singing be considered important, both in the opening and closing exercises of our meetings, and as an accomplishment of our Seventies, praying must be regarded as of far more importance. As gold to brass; as diamonds to pebbles; so is prayer to singing, even, so much more important is it. Yet how little attention is given to prayer! I mean to the cultivation of the gift of it; to nourishing the spirit of it. After an elapse of two thousand years we still have need of going to the Master and saying, \"Lord teach us how to pray.\" To attempt any extended suggestions on the subject here, however, would be beyond the scope of this introduction; all that can be done is to call attention to the need of good taste being observed when addressing the All Father; appropriateness of our petitions to the occasion, respectfulness and reverence in the manner of our address; avoiding a frequent repetition of the divine name or titles; and, above all, right feeling towards the Good Father when speaking to him.  _THE ORGAN OF THE SEVENTIES_.  The Seventies are to be congratulated upon now having an organ through which the First Council can communicate with them from time to time without the inconvenience and expense of special circulars. That the Seventies have an organ may be matter of surprise to them, since this is the first announcement of the fact, and there has been but little agitation of the matter though it has been the proverbial \"long felt want.\" It came about in the following manner: The First Council suggested to President Joseph F. Smith that the \"Improvement Era,\" now the organ of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, could easily be extended in its scope so as to become also the organ of the Seventies. Its general literature is already, in the main, of the class our Seventies would do well to read. The Era has been the vehicle through which very many important doctrinal articles have been published; and having become the organ of the Seventies, as well as of the Young Men's association, is a guarantee that it will continue that line of work, and perhaps more abundantly in the future than in the past. There will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#2)"],["body","a Seventies' department opened in the magazine, of several pages, in which will be published each month suggestions and directions relative to Seventies' class work, quorum discipline and general management. Of the advantages of such an arrangement little need be urged since they must be obvious to all. Hereafter, then, the Improvement Era will be known as the \"ORGAN OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE YOUNG MEN'S MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS.\"  The First Council bespeak for our organ the hearty support of all the Seventies. Its success has depended heretofore on the love and loyalty of the Young Men's Association; hereafter that will be supplemented by the love and loyalty of the Seventies' quorums. The attention of the members of the quorums should at once be called to this new adjunct in our work and they be invited to become subscribers to our magazine. We suggest that one or two members in each quorum be appointed to solicit subscriptions within the quorum, that each member be given the direct opportunity to become a subscriber. The Era, it will be understood, has no other agents except those appointed by the Young Men's Association in the respective wards and branches of the Church, and now, of course, those who will be appointed by our quorums. The service is to be given without remuneration--soliciting subscriptions within our quorums is to be a work of love and interest. The price is two dollars per year, paid in advance, and subscriptions should be sent by the quorum agent to the manager of the Era, Elder Alpha J. Higgs, Era office, 214 Templeton Building, Salt Lake City. Promptness and efficiency in dealing with this matter is expected.  It is a fortunate circumstance that this inauguration of better working conditions for the quorums of Seventies, and the beginning of the volume of the Era--volume XI--should start off together, viz., in the month of November. But is it not a co-ordination of circumstances brought about by the operation of the Spirit of the Lord upon the minds of the brethren rather than a matter of good fortune? So many things have conjoined for this new movement among the Seventies to augur success that those of us who have been watching its development cannot doubt but that                            _\"God Wills It!\"_  _CONCLUSION_.  And now, brethren of the Seventies, in conclusion: Be earnest in this work. Be thorough, patient, self-denying. A great opportunity has come to us--let us make the most of it, and be grateful that it has come. Let no difficulties appall us. We can overcome them. Let us say of difficulties, what Napoleon said of the Alps, when the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of crossing them with an army was suggested, he answered:                        \"There Shall Be No Alps!\"_  REMEMBER! _To become a Seventy means mental activity, intellectual development, and the attainment of spiritual power_.  _A SUGGESTED LIST OF BOOKS OF REFERENCE_.  The following named books of reference will be especially useful in the present year's course of study. It is not expected, of course, that all our Seventies will be able to secure the entire collection suggested, but it would be well for our members to purchase so many of them as they can afford to buy as the beginning of a small personal library. The books recommended will not only be useful for the present year's lessons, but are standard books that will be useful in all the courses of study yet to be prescribed. Inasmuch as individuals may not be able to purchase these books, we suggest that it would be well for each quorum to take under consideration the propriety of the quorum as a body obtaining this complete list as the foundation of a quorum reference library, that might be available to all for preparation.  1. _\"The Seventy's Indispensible Library:\"_ This consists of the Cambridge Bible, the Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, (bound in one volume) and the Richards-Little Compendium; price, post-paid, $9.00.  _Webster's New Standard Dictionary of the English Language_, adapted for High School, Academic and Collegiate Courses; price, $1.50.  _The Works of Flavius-Josephus,_ in one volume, by William Whiston, A. M., David McKay, Publisher, 23 South Ninth Street, Philadelphia, $1.50.  _Dictionary of the Bible_ (Dr. William Smith's). The most desirable edition of this work is the four volume edition of Prof. H. B. Hackett, D. D., published by Houghton-Mifflin & Co., Boston. It is a very valuable work and contains, \"by universal consent, the fruit of the ripest biblical scholarship of England, and constitutes a library of itself, superceding the use of many books otherwise necessary.\" The price in leather binding, $25.00. The Seventies individually may not be able to purchase this edition, but where quorums unite for the purchase of books this is the edition that should be secured.  There is, however, a one volume edition of this work, known as  _Smith's Smaller Dictionary of the Bible,_ published by Fleming H. Revell Co., New York and Chicago, $1.25, post-paid.  _Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature,_ edited by John Kitto, two volumes, S. W. Green's Son, Publishers, 74, 76 Beekmen St., New York. If Smith's Dictionary is not secured then the work next in value is the one here named.  _\"A Commentary Critical and Explanatory of the Old and New Testament,\"_ Jamieson-Fausset-Brown, S. S. Scranton & Co., Hartford, Publishers. This is a very excellent work, and frequently quoted in the references and also in the notes of the present year's course of study. As remarked in one of the notes, the Elders who make up our ministry may not accept the doctrinal interpretation of this or any other commentary, yet its historical and critical treatises are among the most recent and valuable.  _The Old Testament History,_ by William Smith, Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York; price, $2.00. This work is designed by the compiler and editor as a manual in relation to Hebrew history and on a par with the histories of Greece and Rome, generally used in our best schools. As a digest of Biblical History, it is a most valuable work.  _Dr. Smith's New Testament History,_ with introduction, connecting the history of the Old Testament with the New, Harper Brothers, New York. This work stands in the same relationship to the New Testament History that the previously mentioned work does to the Old.  _\"Illustrated Bible Treasury,\"_ edited by William Wright, D. D. To those who may have neither Cambridge or Oxford or Nelson Bible Helps, we recommend this as a very valuable collection of material, including a Concordance, a Dictionary and Maps, and upwards of 350 illustrations, on Bible subjects; price, post-paid, seventy-five cents.  As helps in the study of the Book of Mormon we recommend:  _Reynolds' Dictionary of the Book of Mormon._  _Y. M. M. I. A. Manuals, Nos. 7, 8 and 9,_ containing Elder Roberts' treatise on the Book of Mormon, including a consideration of External and Internal Evidences, price twenty-five cents per number.  _Defense of the Faith and the Saints_ (just out from the press), price $1.50.  _Y. M. M. I. A. Manual, No. 10;_ subject, Modern Revelation, especially valuable in the study of the Doctrine and Covenants; price twenty-five cents. Manuals can be obtained from the Era office, Templeton Building, Salt Lake City.  _The Book of Abraham._ Its Authenticity as a Divine and Ancient Record, (Elder George Reynolds).  _The Improvement Era, organ of the Seventies and Y. M. M. I. Associations,_ for current literature, comment and special articles on subjects of first year's Seventies' work, price $2.00 per year, in advance.    _The Seventy's Course in Theology._  __FIRST YEAR_._    _PART I._  _Outline History of the Seventy._    LESSON I.  _THE SEVENTY IN THREE DISPENSATIONS._    ANALYSIS.
