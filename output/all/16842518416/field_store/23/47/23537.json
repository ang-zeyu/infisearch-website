We could not and ought not to be rigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so different for emergencies so utterly unanticipated.  The fathers themselves would have been the first to declare that their prerogatives were not irrevocable.  They would surely have resisted secession could they have lived to see the shape it assumed.  I travelled through the Northwest considerably during the winter of 1860-1.  We had customers in all the little towns in south-west Wisconsin, south-east Minnesota and north-east Iowa.  These generally knew I had been a captain in the regular army and had served through the Mexican war.  Consequently wherever I stopped at night, some of the people would come to the public-house where I was, and sit till a late hour discussing the probabilities of the future.  My own views at that time were like those officially expressed by Mr. Seward at a later day, that \"the war would be over in ninety days.\"  I continued to entertain these views until after the battle of Shiloh.  I believe now that there would have been no more battles at the West after the capture of Fort Donelson if all the troops in that region had been under a single commander who would have followed up that victory.  There is little doubt in my mind now that the prevailing sentiment of the South would have been opposed to secession in 1860 and 1861, if there had been a fair and calm expression of opinion, unbiased by threats, and if the ballot of one legal voter had counted for as much as that of any other.  But there was no calm discussion of the question. Demagogues who were too old to enter the army if there should be a war, others who entertained so high an opinion of their own ability that they did not believe they could be spared from the direction of the affairs of state in such an event, declaimed vehemently and unceasingly against the North; against its aggressions upon the South; its interference with Southern rights, etc., etc.  They denounced the Northerners as cowards, poltroons, negro-worshippers; claimed that one Southern man was equal to five Northern men in battle; that if the South would stand up for its rights the North would back down.  Mr. Jefferson Davis said in a speech, delivered at La Grange, Mississippi, before the secession of that State, that he would agree to drink all the blood spilled south of Mason and Dixon's line if there should be a war.  The young men who would have the fighting to do in case of war, believed all these statements, both in regard to the aggressiveness of the North and its cowardice.  They, too, cried out for a separation from such people.  The great bulk of the legal voters of the South were men who owned no slaves; their homes were generally in the hills and poor country; their facilities for educating their children, even up to the point of reading and writing, were very limited; their interest in the contest was very meagre--what there was, if they had been capable of seeing it, was with the North; they too needed emancipation.  Under the old regime they were looked down upon by those who controlled all the affairs in the interest of slave-owners, as poor white trash who were allowed the ballot so long as they cast it according to direction.  I am aware that this last statement may be disputed and individual testimony perhaps adduced to show that in ante-bellum days the ballot was as untrammelled in the south as in any section of the country; but in the face of any such contradiction I reassert the statement.  The shot-gun was not resorted to.  Masked men did not ride over the country at night intimidating voters; but there was a firm feeling that a class existed in every State with a sort of divine right to control public affairs.  If they could not get this control by one means they must by another.  The end justified the means.  The coercion, if mild, was complete.  There were two political parties, it is true, in all the States, both strong in numbers and respectability, but both equally loyal to the institution which stood paramount in Southern eyes to all other institutions in state or nation.  The slave-owners were the minority, but governed both parties.  Had politics ever divided the slave-holders and the non-slave-holders, the majority would have been obliged to yield, or internecine war would have been the consequence.  I do not know that the Southern people were to blame for this condition of affairs. There was a time when slavery was not profitable, and the discussion of the merits of the institution was confined almost exclusively to the territory where it existed.  The States of Virginia and Kentucky came near abolishing slavery by their own acts, one State defeating the measure by a tie vote and the other only lacking one.  But when the institution became profitable, all talk of its abolition ceased where it existed; and naturally, as human nature is constituted, arguments were adduced in its support.  The cotton-gin probably had much to do with the justification of slavery.  The winter of 1860-1 will be remembered by middle-aged people of to-day as one of great excitement.  South Carolina promptly seceded after the result of the Presidential election was known.  Other Southern States proposed to follow.  In some of them the Union sentiment was so strong that it had to be suppressed by force.  Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky and Missouri, all Slave States, failed to pass ordinances of secession; but they were all represented in the so-called congress of the so-called Confederate States.  The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Missouri, in 1861, Jackson and Reynolds, were both supporters of the rebellion and took refuge with the enemy.  The governor soon died, and the lieutenant-governor assumed his office; issued proclamations as governor of the State; was recognized as such by the Confederate Government, and continued his pretensions until the collapse of the rebellion. The South claimed the sovereignty of States, but claimed the right to coerce into their confederation such States as they wanted, that is, all the States where slavery existed.  They did not seem to think this course inconsistent.  The fact is, the Southern slave-owners believed that, in some way, the ownership of slaves conferred a sort of patent of nobility--a right to govern independent of the interest or wishes of those who did not hold such property.  They convinced themselves, first, of the divine origin of the institution and, next, that that particular institution was not safe in the hands of any body of legislators but themselves.  Meanwhile the Administration of President Buchanan looked helplessly on and proclaimed that the general government had no power to interfere; that the Nation had no power to save its own life.  Mr. Buchanan had in his cabinet two members at least, who were as earnest--to use a mild term--in the cause of secession as Mr. Davis or any Southern statesman. One of them, Floyd, the Secretary of War, scattered the army so that much of it could be captured when hostilities should commence, and distributed the cannon and small arms from Northern arsenals throughout the South so as to be on hand when treason wanted them.  The navy was scattered in like manner.  The President did not prevent his cabinet preparing for war upon their government, either by destroying its resources or storing them in the South until a de facto government was established with Jefferson Davis as its President, and Montgomery, Alabama, as the Capital.  The secessionists had then to leave the cabinet.  In their own estimation they were aliens in the country which had given them birth.  Loyal men were put into their places.  Treason in the executive branch of the government was estopped.  But the harm had already been done.  The stable door was locked after the horse had been stolen.  During all of the trying winter of 1860-1, when the Southerners were so defiant that they would not allow within their borders the expression of a sentiment hostile to their views, it was a brave man indeed who could stand up and proclaim his loyalty to the Union.  On the other hand men at the North--prominent men--proclaimed that the government had no power to coerce the South into submission to the laws of the land; that if the North undertook to raise armies to go south, these armies would have to march over the dead bodies of the speakers.  A portion of the press of the North was constantly proclaiming similar views. When the time arrived for the President-elect to go to the capital of the Nation to be sworn into office, it was deemed unsafe for him to travel, not only as a President-elect, but as any private citizen should be allowed to do. Instead of going in a special car, receiving the good wishes of his constituents at all the stations along the road, he was obliged to stop on the way and to be smuggled into the capital.  He disappeared from public view on his journey, and the next the country knew, his arrival was announced at the capital.  There is little doubt that he would have been assassinated if he had attempted to travel openly throughout his journey.    CHAPTER XVII.  OUTBREAK OF THE REBELLION--PRESIDING AT A UNION MEETING--MUSTERING OFFICER OF STATE TROOPS--LYON AT CAMP JACKSON--SERVICES TENDERED TO THE GOVERNMENT.  The 4th of March, 1861, came, and Abraham Lincoln was sworn to maintain the Union against all its enemies.  The secession of one State after another followed, until eleven had gone out.  On the 11th of April Fort Sumter, a National fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, was fired upon by the Southerners and a few days after was captured.  The Confederates proclaimed themselves aliens, and thereby debarred themselves of all right to claim protection under the Constitution of the United States.  We did"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5861"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 2. (#5)"],["body","admit the fact that they were aliens, but all the same, they debarred themselves of the right to expect better treatment than people of any other foreign state who make war upon an independent nation.  Upon the firing on Sumter President Lincoln issued his first call for troops and soon after a proclamation convening Congress in extra session.  The call was for 75,000 volunteers for ninety days' service.  If the shot fired at Fort Sumter \"was heard around the world,\" the call of the President for 75,000 men was heard throughout the Northern States.  There was not a state in the North of a million of inhabitants that would not have furnished the entire number faster than arms could have been supplied to them, if it had been necessary.  As soon as the news of the call for volunteers reached Galena, posters were stuck up calling for a meeting of the citizens at the court-house in the evening.  Business ceased entirely; all was excitement; for a time there were no party distinctions; all were Union men, determined to avenge the insult to the national flag.  In the evening the court-house was packed.  Although a comparative stranger I was called upon to preside; the sole reason, possibly, was that I had been in the army and had seen service.  With much embarrassment and some prompting I made out to announce the object of the meeting.  Speeches were in order, but it is doubtful whether it would have been safe just then to make other than patriotic ones.  There was probably no one in the house, however, who felt like making any other.  The two principal speeches were by B. B. Howard, the post-master and a Breckinridge Democrat at the November election the fall before, and John A. Rawlins, an elector on the Douglas ticket.  E. B. Washburne, with whom I was not acquainted at that time, came in after the meeting had been organized, and expressed, I understood afterwards, a little surprise that Galena could not furnish a presiding officer for such an occasion without taking a stranger.  He came forward and was introduced, and made a speech appealing to the patriotism of the meeting.  After the speaking was over volunteers were called for to form a company.  The quota of Illinois had been fixed at six regiments; and it was supposed that one company would be as much as would be accepted from Galena.  The company was raised and the officers and non-commissioned officers elected before the meeting adjourned.  I declined the captaincy before the balloting, but announced that I would aid the company in every way I could and would be found in the service in some position if there should be a war.  I never went into our leather store after that meeting, to put up a package or do other business.  The ladies of Galena were quite as patriotic as the men.  They could not enlist, but they conceived the idea of sending their first company to the field uniformed.  They came to me to get a description of the United States uniform for infantry; subscribed and bought the material; procured tailors to cut out the garments, and the ladies made them up. In a few days the company was in uniform and ready to report at the State capital for assignment.  The men all turned out the morning after their enlistment, and I took charge, divided them into squads and superintended their drill.  When they were ready to go to Springfield I went with them and remained there until they were assigned to a regiment.  There were so many more volunteers than had been called for that the question whom to accept was quite embarrassing to the governor, Richard Yates.  The legislature was in session at the time, however, and came to his relief.  A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments, one from each congressional district, for one month, to be paid by the State, but pledged to go into the service of the United States if there should be a further call during their term.  Even with this relief the governor was still very much embarrassed.  Before the war was over he was like the President when he was taken with the varioloid:  \"at last he had something he could give to all who wanted it.\"  In time the Galena company was mustered into the United States service, forming a part of the 11th Illinois volunteer infantry.  My duties, I thought, had ended at Springfield, and I was prepared to start home by the evening train, leaving at nine o'clock.  Up to that time I do not think I had been introduced to Governor Yates, or had ever spoken to him.  I knew him by sight, however, because he was living at the same hotel and I often saw him at table.  The evening I was to quit the capital I left the supper room before the governor and was standing at the front door when he came out.  He spoke to me, calling me by my old army title \"Captain,\" and said he understood that I was about leaving the city.  I answered that I was.  He said he would be glad if I would remain over-night and call at the Executive office the next morning. I complied with his request, and was asked to go into the Adjutant-General's office and render such assistance as I could, the governor saying that my army experience would be of great service there. I accepted the proposition.  My old army experience I found indeed of very great service.  I was no clerk, nor had I any capacity to become one.  The only place I ever found in my life to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side coat-pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful than myself.  But I had been quartermaster, commissary and adjutant in the field.  The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how they should be made out.  There was a clerk in the office of the Adjutant-General who supplied my deficiencies.  The ease with which the State of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the close of the war is evidence of the efficiency of Mr. Loomis as an accountant on a large scale.  He remained in the office until that time.  As I have stated, the legislature authorized the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments.  I had charge of mustering these regiments into the State service.  They were assembled at the most convenient railroad centres in their respective congressional districts. I detailed officers to muster in a portion of them, but mustered three in the southern part of the State myself.  One of these was to assemble at Belleville, some eighteen miles south-east of St. Louis.  When I got there I found that only one or two companies had arrived. There was no probability of the regiment coming together under five days.  This gave me a few idle days which I concluded to spend in St. Louis.  There was a considerable force of State militia at Camp Jackson, on the outskirts of St. Louis, at the time.  There is but little doubt that it was the design of Governor Claiborn Jackson to have these troops ready to seize the United States arsenal and the city of St. Louis.  Why they did not do so I do not know. There was but a small garrison, two companies I think, under Captain N. Lyon at the arsenal, and but for the timely services of the Hon. F. P. Blair, I have little doubt that St. Louis would have gone into rebel hands, and with it the arsenal with all its arms and ammunition.  Blair was a leader among the Union men of St. Louis in 1861. There was no State government in Missouri at the time that would sanction the raising of troops or commissioned officers to protect United States property, but Blair had probably procured some form of authority from the President to raise troops in Missouri and to muster them into the service of the United States.  At all events, he did raise a regiment and took command himself as Colonel.  With this force he reported to Captain Lyon and placed himself and regiment under his orders.  It was whispered that Lyon thus reinforced intended to break up Camp Jackson and capture the militia.  I went down to the arsenal in the morning to see the troops start out.  I had known Lyon for two years at West Point and in the old army afterwards.  Blair I knew very well by sight.  I had heard him speak in the canvass of 1858, possibly several times, but I had never spoken to him.  As the troops marched out of the enclosure around the arsenal, Blair was on his horse outside forming them into line preparatory to their march.  I introduced myself to him and had a few moments' conversation and expressed my sympathy with his purpose. This was my first personal acquaintance with the Honorable--afterwards Major-General F. P. Blair.  Camp Jackson surrendered without a fight and the garrison was marched down to the arsenal as prisoners of war.  Up to this time the enemies of the government in St. Louis had been bold and defiant, while Union men were quiet but determined.  The enemies had their head-quarters in a central and public position on Pine Street, near Fifth--from which the rebel flag was flaunted boldly.  The Union men had a place of meeting somewhere in the city, I did not know where, and I doubt whether they dared to enrage the enemies of the government by placing the national flag outside their head-quarters.  As soon as the news of the capture of Camp Jackson reached the city the condition of affairs was changed.  Union men became rampant, aggressive, and, if you will, intolerant.  They proclaimed their sentiments boldly, and were impatient at anything like disrespect for the Union.  The secessionists became quiet but were filled with suppressed rage.  They had been playing the bully.  The Union men ordered the rebel flag taken down from the building on Pine Street.  The command was given in tones of authority and it was taken down, never to be raised again in St. Louis.  I witnessed the scene.  I had heard of the surrender of the camp and that the garrison was on its way to the arsenal.  I had seen the troops start out in the morning and had wished them success.  I now determined to go to the arsenal and await"]]]
