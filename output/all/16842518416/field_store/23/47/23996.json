He would soon become a captain and then perhaps a great admiral.  And so the matter was at last settled. George's brothers knew the master of a trading ship who was getting ready to sail to England. He agreed to take the boy with him and teach him how to be a good sailor.  George's mother was very sad. His uncle had written her a letter saying:  \"Do not let him go to sea. If he begins as a common sailor, he will never be anything else.\"  But George had made up his mind to go. He was headstrong and determined. He would not listen to any one who tried to persuade him to stay at home. At last the day came for the ship to sail. It was waiting in the river. A boat was at the landing, ready to take him on board. The little chest that held his clothing had been carried down to the bank. George was in high glee at the thought of going.  \"Good-by, mother,\" he said.  He stood on the doorstep and looked back into the house. He saw the kind faces of those whom he loved. He began to feel very sad.  \"Good-by, my dear boy!\"  George saw the tears in his mother's eyes. He saw them rolling down her cheeks. He knew that she did not wish him to go. He could not bear to see her grief.  He stood still for a moment, thinking. Then he turned quickly and said, \"Mother, I have changed my mind. I will stay at home and do as you wish.\" Then he called to the black boy, who was waiting at the door, and said, \"Tom, run down to the shore and tell them not to put the chest in the boat. Send word to the captain not to wait for me, for I have changed my mind. I am not going to sea.\"  Who has not heard of George Washington? It has been said of him that he was the \"first in war, the first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\" He was our most famous president. He has been called the Father of his Country.     THE SHEPHERD-BOY PAINTER    One day a traveler was walking through a part of Italy where a great many sheep were pasturing. Near the top of a hill he saw a little shepherd boy who was lying on the ground while a flock of sheep and lambs were grazing around him.  As he came nearer he saw that the boy held a charred stick in his hand, with which he was drawing something on a flat rock. The lad was so much interested in his work that he did not see the stranger.  [Illustration]  The stranger bent over him and looked at the picture he had made on the rock. It was the picture of a sheep, and it was drawn so well that the stranger was filled with astonishment.  \"What is your name, my boy?\" he said.  The lad was startled. He jumped to his feet and looked up at the kind gentleman.  \"My name is Giotto,\" [Footnote: Giotto (_pro_. jot'to).] he answered.  \"What is your father's name?\"  \"Bondone.\" [Footnote: BON do'na.]  \"And whose sheep are these?\"  \"They belong to the rich man who lives in the big white house there among the trees. My father works in the field, and I take care of the sheep.\" \"How would you like to live with me, Giotto? I would teach you how to draw pictures of sheep and horses, and even of men,\" said the stranger. The boy's face beamed with delight. \"I should like to learn to do that--oh, ever so much!\" he answered. \"But I must do as father says.\" \"Let us go and ask him,\" said the stranger.  The stranger's name was Cimabue.[Footnote: Cimabue (_pro_. she ma boo'a).] He was the most famous painter of the time. His pictures were known and admired in every city of Italy.  Bondone was surprised when Cimabue offered to take his little boy to Florence and teach him to be a great painter.  \"I know that the lad can draw pictures wonderfully well,\" he said. \"He does not like to do anything else. Perhaps he will do well with you. Yes, you may take him.\"  In the city of Florence [Footnote: Flor'ence.] little Giotto saw some of the finest pictures in the world. He learned so fast that he could soon paint as well as Cimabue himself.  One day Cimabue was painting the picture of a man's face. Night came on before he had finished it. \"I will leave it till morning,\" he said; \"then the light will be better.\"  In the morning, when he looked at the picture, he saw a fly on the man's nose. He tried to brush it off, but it remained there. It was only a painted fly.  \"Who has done this?\" he cried. He was angry, and yet he was pleased.  Little Giotto came out from a corner, trembling and ashamed. \"I did it, master,\" he said. \"It was a good place for a fly, and I never thought of spoiling your picture.\"  He expected to be punished. But Cimabue only praised him for his great skill. \"There are few men who can draw so good a picture of a fly,\" he said.  This happened six hundred years ago, in the city of Florence in Italy. The shepherd boy became a very famous painter and the friend of many famous men.     TWO GREAT PAINTERS    There was once a painter whose name was Zeuxis. [Footnote: Zeuxis (_pro_. zuke'sis).] He could paint pictures so life-like that they were mistaken for the real things which they represented.  At one time he painted the picture of some fruit which was so real that the birds flew down and pecked at it. This made him very proud of his skill.  \"I am the only man in the world who can paint a picture so true to life,\" he said.  There was another famous artist whose name was Parrhasius. [Footnote: Parrhasius (_pro_. pa ra'shl us).] When he heard of the boast which Zeuxis had made, he said to himself, \"I will see what I can do.\"  So he painted a beautiful picture which seemed to be covered with a curtain. Then he invited Zeuxis to come and see it.  Zeuxis looked at it closely. \"Draw the curtain aside and show us the picture,\" he said.  Parrhasius laughed and answered, \"The curtain is the picture.\"  \"Well,\" said Zeuxis, \"you have beaten me this time, and I shall boast no more. I deceived only the birds, but you have deceived me, a painter.\"  Some time after this, Zeuxis painted another wonderful picture. It was that of a boy carrying a basket of ripe red cherries. When he hung this painting outside of his door, some birds flew down and tried to carry the cherries away.  \"Ah! this picture is a failure,\" he said. \"For if the boy had been as well painted as the cherries, the birds would have been afraid to come near him.\"     THE KING AND THE BEES    One day King Solomon was sitting on his throne, and his great men were standing around him.  Suddenly the door was thrown open and the Queen of Sheba came in.  \"O King,\" she said, \"in my own country, far, far away, I have heard much about your power and glory, but much more about your wisdom. Men have told me that there is no riddle so cunning that you can not solve it. Is this true?\"  [Illustration]  \"It is as you say, O Queen,\" answered Solomon.  \"Well, I have here a puzzle which I think will test your wisdom. Shall I show it to you?\"  \"Most certainly, O Queen.\"  Then she held up in each hand a beautiful wreath of flowers. The wreaths were so nearly alike that none of those who were with the king could point out any difference.  \"One of these wreaths.\" said the queen, \"is made of flowers plucked from your garden. The other is made of artificial flowers, shaped and colored by a skillful artist. Now, tell me, O King, which is the true, and which is the false?\"  The king, for once, was puzzled. He stroked his chin. He looked at the wreaths from every side. He frowned. He bit his lips.  \"Which is the true?\" the queen again asked.  Still the king did not answer.  \"I have heard that you are the wisest man in the world,\" she said, \"and surely this simple thing ought not to puzzle you.\"  The king moved uneasily on his golden throne. His officers and great men shook their heads. Some would have smiled, if they had dared.  \"Look at the flowers carefully,\" said the queen, \"and let us have your answer.\"  Then the king remembered something. He remembered that close by his window there was a climbing vine filled with beautiful sweet flowers. He remembered that he had seen many bees flying among these flowers and gathering honey from them.  So he said, \"Open the window!\"  It was opened. The queen was standing quite near to it with the two wreaths still in her hands. All eyes were turned to see why the king had said, \"Open the window.\"  The next moment two bees flew eagerly in. Then came another and another. All flew to the flowers in the queen's right hand. Not one of the bees so much as looked at those in her left hand.  \"O Queen of Sheba, the bees have given you my answer,\" then said Solomon.  And the queen said, \"You are wise, King Solomon. You gather knowledge from the little things which common men pass by unnoticed.\"  King Solomon lived three thousand years ago. He built a great temple in Jerusalem, and was famous for his wisdom.     OUR FIRST GREAT PAINTER    A long time ago there lived, in Pennsylvania, a little boy whose name was Benjamin West.  This boy loved pictures. Indeed, there were few things that he loved more. But he had never seen any pictures except a few small ones in a book. His father and mother were Quakers, and they did not think it was right to spend money for such things. They thought that pictures might take one's mind away from things that were better or more useful.  One day Benjamin's mother had to go to a neighbor's on some errand. So she told Benjamin to stay in the house and take care of his baby sister till she came back.  He was glad to do this; for he loved the baby.  \"Yes, mother,\" he said, \"I will watch her every minute. I won't let anything hurt her.\"  The baby was asleep in her cradle, and he must not make a noise and waken her. For some time he sat very still. He heard the clock ticking. He heard the birds singing. He began to feel a little lonesome.  A fly lighted on the baby's cheek, and he brushed it away. Then he thought what a pretty picture might be made of his sister's sweet face and little hands.  He had no paper, but he knew where there was a smooth board. He had no pencil, but there was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],["title","Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#6)"],["body","of black charcoal on the hearth. How pretty the baby was! He began to draw. The baby smiled but did not wake up.  [Illustration]  As often as he touched the charcoal to the smooth board, the picture grew. Here was her round head, covered with pretty curls. Here was her mouth. Here were her eyes, and here her dainty ears. Here was her fat little neck. Here were her wonderful hands.  So busy was he with the drawing that he did not think of anything else. He heard neither the clock nor the birds. He did not even hear his mother's footsteps as she came into the room. He did not hear her soft breathing as she stood over him and watched him finish the wonderful drawing. \"O Benjamin! what has thee been doing?\" she cried.  The lad sprang up alarmed.  \"It's only a picture of the baby, mother,\" he said.  \"A picture of the baby! Oh, wonderful! It looks just like her!\"  The good woman was so overjoyed that she caught him in her arms and kissed him. Then suddenly she began to wonder whether this was right.  \"Benjamin, how did thee learn to draw such a picture?\" she asked.  \"I didn't learn,\" he answered. \"I just did it. I couldn't help but do it.\"  When Benjamin's father came home, his mother showed him the picture. \"It looks just like her, doesn't it?\" she said. \"But I am afraid. I don't know what to think. Does thee suppose that it is very wrong for Benjamin to do such a thing?\"  The father did not answer. He turned the picture this way and that, and looked at it from every side. He compared it with the baby's pretty face. Then he handed it back to his wife and said:--  \"Put it away. It may be that the hand of the Lord is in this.\"  Several weeks afterward, there came a visitor to the home of the Wests. It was a good old Friend, whom everybody loved--a-white-haired, pleasant-faced minister, whose words were always wise.  Benjamin's parents showed him the picture. They told him how the lad was always trying to draw something. And they asked what they should do about it.  The good minister looked at the picture for a long time. Then he called little Benjamin to him. He put his hands on the lad's head and said:--  \"This child has a wonderful gift. We cannot understand it nor the reason of it. Let us trust that great good may come from it, and that Benjamin West may grow up to be an honor to our country and the world.\"  And the words of the old minister came true. The pictures of Benjamin West made him famous. He was the first great American painter.     THE YOUNG SCOUT    When Andrew Jackson was a little boy he lived with his mother in South Carolina. He was eight years old when he heard about the ride of Paul Revere and the famous fight at Lexington.  It was then that the long war, called the Revolutionary War, began. The king's soldiers were sent into every part of the country. The people called them the British. Some called them \"red-coats.\"  There was much fighting; and several great battles took place between the British and the Americans.  At last Charleston, in South Carolina, was taken by the British. Andrew Jackson was then a tall white-haired boy, thirteen years old.  \"I am going to help drive those red-coated British out of the country,\" he said to his mother.  Then, without another word, he mounted his brother's little farm horse and rode away. He was not old enough to be a soldier, but he could be a scout--and a good scout he was.  He was very tall--as tall as a man. He was not afraid of anything. He was strong and ready for every duty.  One day as he was riding through the woods, some British soldiers saw him. They quickly surrounded him and made him their prisoner.  \"Come with us,\" they said, \"and we will teach you that the king's soldiers are not to be trifled with.\"  They took him to the British camp.  \"What is your name, young rebel?\" said the British captain.  \"Andy Jackson.\"  \"Well, Andy Jackson, get down here and clean the mud from my boots.\"  Andrew's gray eyes blazed as he stood up straight and proud before the haughty captain.  \"Sir,\" he said, \"I am a prisoner of war, and demand to be treated as such.\"  \"You rebel!\" shouted the captain. \"Down with you, and clean those boots at once.\"  The slim, tall boy seemed to grow taller, as he answered, \"I'll not be the servant of any Englishman that ever lived.\"  [Illustration]  The captain was very angry. He drew his sword to hit the boy with its flat side. Andrew threw out his hand and received an ugly gash across the knuckles.  Some other officers, who had seen the whole affair, cried out to the captain, \"Shame! He is a brave boy. He deserves to be treated as a gentleman.\"  Andrew was not held long as a prisoner. The British soldiers soon returned to Charleston, and he was allowed to go home.  In time, Andrew Jackson became a very great man. He was elected to Congress, he was chosen judge of the supreme court of Tennessee, he was appointed general in the army, and lastly he was for eight years the president of the United States.     THE LAD WHO RODE SIDESADDLE    When Daniel Webster was a child he lived in the country, far from any city. He was not strong enough to work on the farm like his brothers; but he loved books and study.  He was very young when he was first sent to school. The schoolhouse was two or three miles from home, but he did not mind the long walk through the woods and over the hills.  He soon learned all that his teacher could teach; for he was bright and quick, and had a good memory.  His father hoped that Daniel would grow up to be a wise and famous man. \"But,\" said he, \"no man can rightly succeed without an education.\"  So it was decided that the boy should go to some school where he might be prepared for college.  One evening his father said to him, \"Daniel, you must be up early in the morning. You are going to Exeter with me.\"  \"To Exeter, father!\" said Daniel.  \"Yes, to Exeter. I am going to put you in the academy there.\"  The academy at Exeter was a famous school for preparing boys for college. It is still a famous school. But Daniel's father did not say anything about college.  There were no railroads at that time, and Exeter was nearly fifty miles away. Daniel and his father would ride there on horseback.  Early in the morning two horses were brought to the door. One was Mr. Webster's horse; the other was an old gray nag with a lady's sidesaddle on its back.  \"Who is going to ride that nag?\" asked Daniel.  \"Young Dan Webster,\" answered his father.  \"But I don't want a sidesaddle. I'm not a lady.\"  \"I understand,\" said Mr. Webster. \"But our neighbor, Johnson, is sending the nag to Exeter for the use of a lady who is to ride back with me. He does me a favor by allowing you to ride on the animal, and I do him a favor by taking care of it.\"  \"But won't it look rather funny for me to ride to Exeter on a sidesaddle?\"  \"Well, if a lady can ride on it, perhaps Dan Webster can do as much.\"  And so they set out on their journey to Exeter. Mr. Webster rode in front, and Daniel, on the old gray nag, followed behind. The roads were muddy, and they went slowly. It took them two days to reach Exeter.  The people whom they met gazed at them and wondered who they could be. They scarcely noticed the sidesaddle; they noticed only the boy's dark eyes and his strong, noble face.  His clothes were of homemade stuff; his shoes were coarse and heavy; he had no gloves on his hands; he was awkward and bashful.  Yet there was something in his manner and voice that caused everybody to admire him.  Daniel Webster lived to become a famous orator and a great statesman. He was honored at home and abroad.     THE WHISPERERS    \"Boys, what did I tell you?\"  The schoolmaster spoke angrily. He was in trouble because his scholars would not study. Whenever his back was turned, they were sure to begin whispering to one another.  \"Girls, stop your whispering, I say.\"  But still they would whisper, and he could not prevent it. The afternoon was half gone, and the trouble was growing. Then the master thought of a plan.  \"Children,\" he said, \"we are going to play a new game. The next one that whispers must come out and stand in the middle of the floor. He must stand there until he sees some one else whisper. Then he will tell me, and the one whom he names must come and take his place. He, in turn, will watch and report the first one that he sees whisper. And so we will keep the game going till it is time for school to be dismissed. The boy or girl who is standing at that time will be punished for all of you.\"  \"What will the punishment be, Mr. Johnson?\" asked a bold, bad boy. \"A good thrashing,\" answered the master. He was tired, he was vexed, he hardly knew what he said.  The children thought the new game was very funny. First, Tommy Jones whispered to Billy Brown and was at once called out to stand on the floor. Within less than two minutes, Billy saw Mary Green whispering, and she had to take his place. Mary looked around and saw Samuel Miller asking his neighbor for a pencil, and Samuel was called. And so the fun went on until the clock showed that it lacked only ten minutes till school would be dismissed.  Then all became very good and very careful, for no one wished to be standing at the time of dismissal. They knew that the master would be as good as his word.  The clock ticked loudly, and Tommy Jones, who was standing up for the fourth time, began to feel very uneasy. He stood on one leg and then on the other, and watched very closely; but nobody whispered. Could it be possible that he would receive that thrashing? Suddenly, to his great joy he saw little Lucy Martin lean over her desk and whisper to the girl in front of her. Now Lucy was the pet of the school. Everybody loved her, and this was the first time she had whispered that day. But Tommy didn't care for that. He wished to escape the punishment, and so he called out, \"Lucy Martin!\" and went proudly to his seat.  Little Lucy had not meant to whisper. There was something which she wished very much to know "]]]
