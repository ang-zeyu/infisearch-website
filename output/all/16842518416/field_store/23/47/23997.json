With tears in her eyes she went out and stood in the whisperer's place.  [Illustration]  She was very much ashamed and hurt, for it was the first time that she had ever been in disgrace at school. The other girls felt sorry that she should suffer for so small a fault. The boys looked at her and wondered if the master would really be as good as his word.  The clock kept on ticking. It lacked only one minute till the bell would strike the time for dismissal. What a shame that dear, gentle Lucy should be punished for all those unruly boys and girls!  Then, suddenly, an awkward half-grown boy who sat right in front of the master's desk turned squarely around and whispered to Tommy Jones, three desks away.  Everybody saw him. Little Lucy Martin saw him through her tears, but said nothing. Everybody was astonished, for that boy was the best scholar in the school, and he had never been known to break a rule.  It lacked only half a minute now. The awkward boy turned again and whispered so loudly that even the master could not help hearing: \"Tommy, you deserve a thrashing!\"  \"Elihu Burritt, take your place on the floor,\" said the master sternly. The awkward boy stepped out quickly, and little Lucy Martin returned to her seat sobbing. At the same moment the bell struck and school was dismissed.  After all the others had gone home, the master took down his long birch rod and said: \"Elihu, I suppose I must be as good as my word. But tell me why you so deliberately broke the rule against whispering.\"  \"I did it to save little Lucy,\" said the awkward boy, standing up very straight and brave. \"I could not bear to see her punished.\"  \"Elihu, you may go home,\" said the master.  All this happened many years ago in New Britain, Connecticut. Elihu Burritt was a poor boy who was determined to learn. He worked many years as a blacksmith and studied books whenever he had a spare moment. He learned many languages and became known all over the world as \"The Learned Blacksmith.\"     HOW A PRINCE LEARNED TO READ  I    A thousand years ago boys and girls did not learn to read. Books were very scarce and very precious, and only a few men could read them.  Each book was written with a pen or a brush. The pictures were painted by hand, and some of them were very beautiful. A good book would sometimes cost as much as a good house.  In those times there were even some kings who could not read. They thought more of hunting and fighting than of learning.  There was one such king who had four sons, Ethelbald, Ethelbert, Ethelred, and Alfred.[Footnote: Eth'el bald, Eth'el bert, Eth'el red, Al'fred.] The three older boys were sturdy, half-grown lads; the youngest, Alfred, was a slender, fair-haired child.  One day when they were with their mother, she showed them a wonderful book that some rich friend had given her. She turned the leaves and showed them the strange letters. She showed them the beautiful pictures, and told them how they had been drawn and painted.  They admired the book very much, for they had never seen anything like it. \"But the best part of it is the story which it tells,\" said their mother. \"If you could only read, you might learn that story and enjoy it. Now I have a mind to give this book to one of you\"  \"Will you give it to me, mother?\" asked little Alfred.  \"I will give it to the one who first learns to read in it\" she answered.  \"I am sure I would rather have a good bow with arrows\" said Ethelred.  \"And I would rather have a young hawk that has been trained to hunt\" said Ethelbert.  \"If I were a priest or a monk\" said Ethelbald, \"I would learn to read. But I am a prince, and it is foolish for princes to waste their time with such things.\"  \"But I should like to know the story which this book tells,\" said Alfred.    II   A few weeks passed by. Then, one morning, Alfred went into his mother's room with a smiling, joyous face.  \"Mother,\" he said, \"will you let me see that beautiful book again?\"  His mother unlocked her cabinet and took the precious volume from its place of safe keeping.  Alfred opened it with careful fingers. Then he began with the first word on the first page and read the first story aloud without making one mistake.  \"O my child, how did you learn to do that?\" cried his mother.  \"I asked the monk, Brother Felix, to teach me,\" said Alfred. \"And every day since you showed me the book, he has given me a lesson. It was no easy thing to learn these letters and how they are put together to make words. Now, Brother Felix says I can read almost as well as he.\"  \"How wonderful!\" said his mother.  \"How foolish!\" said Ethelbald.  [Illustration]  \"You will be a good monk when you grow up,\" said Ethelred, with a sneer.  But his mother kissed him and gave him the beautiful book. \"The prize is yours, Alfred,\" she said. \"I am sure that whether you grow up to be a monk or a king, you will be a wise and noble man.\"  And Alfred did grow up to become the wisest and noblest king that England ever had. In history he is called Alfred the Great.     \"READ, AND YOU WILL KNOW\"    \"Mother, what are the clouds made of? Why does the rain fall? Where does all the rain water go? What good does it do?\"  Little William Jones was always asking questions.  \"I want to know,\" he said; \"I want to know everything.\"  At first his mother tried to answer all his questions. But after he had learned to read, she taught him to look in books for that which he wished to know.  \"Mother, what makes the wind blow?\"  \"Read, and you will know, my child.\"  \"Who lives on the other side of the world?\"  \"Read, and you will know.\"  \"Why is the sky so blue?\"  \"Read, and you will know.\"  \"Oh, mother, I would like to know everything.\"  \"You can never know everything, my child. But you can learn many things from books.\"  \"Yes, mother, I will read and then I will know.\"  He was a very little boy, but before he was three years old he could read quite well. When eight years of age he was the best scholar at the famous school at Harrow. He was always reading, learning, inquiring.  \"I want to know; I want to know,\" he kept saying.  \"Read, and you will know,\" said his mother. \"Read books that are true. Read about things that are beautiful and good. Read in order to become wise.  \"Do not waste your time in reading foolish books. Do not read bad books, they will make you bad. No book is worth reading that does not make you better or wiser.\"  And so William Jones went on reading and learning. He became one of the most famous scholars in the world. The king of England made him a knight and called him Sir William Jones. Sir William Jones lived nearly two hundred years ago. He was noted for his great knowledge, the most of which he had obtained from books. It is said that he could speak and write forty languages.     THE YOUNG CUPBEARER  I    Long, long ago, there lived in Persia a little prince whose name was Cyrus. [Footnote: Cyrus (_pro_. si'rus).]  He was not petted and spoiled like many other princes. Although his father was a king, Cyrus was brought up like the son of a common man.  He knew how to work with his hands. He ate only the plainest food. He slept on a hard bed. He learned to endure hunger and cold.  When Cyrus was twelve years old he went with his mother to Media to visit his grandfather. His grandfather, whose name was Astyages, [Footnote: Astyages (_pro_. as ti'a jeez).] was king of Media, and very rich and powerful.  Cyrus was so tall and strong and handsome that his grandfather was very proud of him. He wished the lad to stay with him in Media. He therefore gave him many beautiful gifts and everything that could please a prince. One day King Astyages planned to make a great feast for the lad. The tables were to be laden with all kinds of food. There was to be music and dancing; and Cyrus was to invite as many guests as he chose. The hour for the feast came. Everything was ready. The servants were there, dressed in fine uniforms. The musicians and dancers were in their places. But no guests came.  \"How is this, my dear boy?\" asked the king. \"The feast is ready, but no one has come to partake of it.\"  \"That is because I have not invited any one,\" said Cyrus.\" In Persia we do not have such feasts. If any one is hungry, he eats some bread and meat, with perhaps a few cresses, and that is the end of it. We never go to all this trouble and expense of making a fine dinner in order that our friends may eat what is not good for them.\"  King Astyages did not know whether to be pleased or displeased.  \"Well,\" said he, \"all these rich foods that were prepared for the feast are yours. What will you do with them?\"  \"I think I will give them to our friends,\" said Cyrus.  So he gave one portion to the king's officer who had taught him to ride. Another portion he gave to an old servant who waited upon his grandfather. And the rest he divided among the young women who took care of his mother.    II   The king's cupbearer, Sarcas, was very much offended because he was not given a share of the feast. The king also wondered why this man, who was his favorite, should be so slighted.  \"Why didn't you give something to Sarcas?\" he asked.  \"Well, truly,\" said Cyrus, \"I do not like him. He is proud and overbearing. He thinks that he makes a fine figure when he waits on you.\" \"And so he does,\" said the king. \"He is very skillful as a cupbearer.\" \"That may be so,\" answered Cyrus, \"but if you will let me be your cupbearer tomorrow, I think I can serve you quite as well.\"  King Astyages smiled. He saw that Cyrus had a will of his own, and this pleased him very much.  \"I shall be glad to see what you can do,\" he said. \"Tomorrow, you shall be the king's cupbearer.\"    III   You would hardly have known the young prince when the time came for him to appear before his grandfather. He was dressed in the rich uniform of the cupbearer, and he came forward with much dignity and grace.  He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],["title","Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#8)"],["body","a white napkin upon his arm, and held the cup of wine very daintily with three of his fingers.  [Illustration]  His manners were perfect. Sarcas himself could not have served the king half so well.  \"Bravo! bravo!\" cried his mother, her eyes sparkling with pride.  \"You have done well\" said his grandfather. \"But you neglected one important thing. It is the rule and custom of the cupbearer to pour out a little of the wine and taste it before handing the cup to me. This you forgot to do.\"  \"Indeed, grandfather, I did not forget it,\" answered Cyrus.  \"Then why didn't you do it?\" asked his mother.  \"Because I believed there was poison in the wine.\"  \"Poison, my boy!\" cried King Astyages, much alarmed. \"Poison! poison!\"  \"Yes, grandfather, poison. For the other day, when you sat at dinner with your officers, I noticed that the wine made you act queerly. After the guests had drunk quite a little of it, they began to talk foolishly and sing loudly; and some of them went to sleep. And you, grandfather, were as bad as the rest. You forgot that you were king. You forgot all your good manners. You tried to dance and fell upon the floor. I am afraid to drink anything that makes men act in that way.\"  \"Didn't you ever see your father behave so?\" asked the king.  \"No, never,\" said Cyrus. \"He does not drink merely to be drinking. He drinks to quench his thirst, and that is all.\"  When Cyrus became a man, he succeeded his father as king of Persia; he also succeeded his grandfather Astyages as king of Media. He was a very wise and powerful ruler, and he made his country the greatest of any that was then known. In history he is commonly called Cyrus the Great.     THE SONS OF THE CALIPH    There was a caliph of Persia whose name was Al Mamoun. [Footnote: Al Mam'oun] He had two sons whom he wished to become honest and noble men. So he employed a wise man whose name was Al Farra to be their teacher. One day, after lesson hours, Al Farra rose to go out of the house. The two boys saw him and ran to fetch his shoes. For in that country, people never wear shoes in the house, but take them off at the door. The two boys ran for the teacher's shoes, and each claimed the honor of carrying them to him. But they dared not quarrel and at last agreed that each should carry one shoe. Thus the honor would be divided. When the caliph heard of this he sent for Al Farra and asked him, \"Who is the most honored of men?\"  The teacher answered, \"I know of no man who is more honored than yourself.\"  \"No, no,\" said the caliph. \"It is the man who rose to go out, and two young princes contended for the honor of giving him his shoes but at last agreed that each should offer him one.\"  Al Farra answered, \"Sir, I should have forbidden them to do this, but I feared to discourage them. I hope that I shall never do anything to make them careless of their duties.\"  \"Well,\" said the caliph, \"if you had forbidden them thus to honor you, I should have declared you in the wrong. They did nothing that was beneath the dignity of princes. Indeed, they honored themselves by honoring you.\" Al Farra bowed low, but said nothing; and the caliph went on. \"No young man nor boy,\" said he, \"can be so high in rank as to neglect three great duties: he must respect his ruler, he must love and obey his father, and he must honor his teacher.\"  Then he called the two young princes to him, and as a reward for their noble conduct, filled their pockets with gold.     THE BOY AND THE ROBBERS    In Persia, when Cyrus the Great was king, boys were taught to tell the truth. This was one of their first lessons at home and at school.  \"None but a coward will tell a falsehood,\" said the father of young Otanes. [Footnote: Otanes (_pro._ o ta'n ez).]  \"Truth is beautiful. Always love it,\" said his mother.  When Otanes was twelve years old, his parents wished to send him to a distant city to study in a famous school that was there. It would be a long journey and a dangerous one. So it was arranged that the boy should travel with a small company of merchants who were going to the same place. \"Good-by, Otanes! Be always brave and truthful,\" said his father. \"Farewell, my child! Love that which is beautiful. Despise that which is base,\" said his mother.  The little company began its long journey. Some of the men rode on camels, some on horses. They went but slowly, for the sun was hot and the way was rough.  Suddenly, towards evening, a band of robbers swooped down upon them. The merchants were not fighting men. They could do nothing but give up all their goods and money.  \"Well, boy, what have you got?\" asked one of the robbers, as he pulled Otanes from his horse.  \"Forty pieces of gold\" answered the lad.  The robber laughed. He had never heard of a boy with so much money as that.  \"That is a good story\" he said. \"Where do you carry your gold?\"  \"It is in my hat, underneath the lining,\" answered Otanes.  \"Oh, well! You can't make me believe that,\" said the robber; and he hurried away to rob one of the rich merchants.  Soon another came up and said, \"My boy, do you happen to have any gold about you?\"  \"Yes! Forty pieces, in my hat, said Otanes.  \"You are a brave lad to be joking with robbers\" said the man; and he also hurried on to a more promising field.  At length the chief of the band called to Otanes and said, \"Young fellow, have you anything worth taking?\"  Otanes answered, \"I have already told two of your men that I have forty pieces of gold in my hat. But they wouldn't believe me.\"  \"Take off your hat,\" said the chief.  [Illustration]  The boy obeyed. The chief tore out the lining and found the gold hidden beneath it.  \"Why did you tell us where to find it?\" he asked. \"No one would have thought that a child like you had gold about him.\"  \"If I had answered your questions differently, I should have told a lie,\" said Otanes; \"and none but cowards tell lies\"  The robber chief was struck by this answer. He thought of the number of times that he himself had been a coward. Then he said, \"You are a brave boy, and you may keep your gold. Here it is. Mount your horse, and my own men will ride with you and see that you reach the end of your journey in safety.\"  Otanes, in time, became one of the famous men of his country. He was the advisor and friend of two of the kings who succeeded Cyrus.    A LESSON IN JUSTICE  Alexander [Footnote: Al ex an'der.] the king of Macedon, [Footnote: Macedon (pro. mas'e don).] wished to become the master of the whole world. He led his armies through many countries. He plundered cities, he burned towns, he destroyed thousands of lives.  At last, far in the East, he came to a land of which he had never heard. The people there knew nothing about war and conquest. Although they were rich, they lived simply and were at peace with all the world.  The shah, or ruler of these people, went out to meet Alexander and welcome him to their country. He led the great king to his palace and begged that he would dine with him.  When they were seated at the table the servants of the shah stood by to serve the meal. They brought in what seemed to be fruits, nuts, cakes, and other delicacies; but when Alexander would eat he found that everything was made of gold.  \"What!\" said he, \"do you eat gold in this country?\"  \"We ourselves eat only common food,\" answered the shah. \"But we have heard that it was the desire for gold which caused you to leave your own country; and so, we wish to satisfy your appetite.\"  \"It was not for gold that I came here,\" said Alexander. \"I came to learn the customs of your people.\"  \"Very well, then,\" said the shah, \"stay with me a little while and observe what you can.\"  While the shah and the king were talking, two countrymen came in. \"My lord,\" said one, \"we have had a disagreement, and wish you to settle the matter.\"  \"Tell me about it,\" said the shah.  \"Well, it is this way,\" answered the man: \"I bought a piece of ground from this neighbor of mine, and paid him a fair price for it. Yesterday, when I was digging in it, I found a box full of gold and jewels. This treasure does not belong to me, for I bought only the ground; but when I offered it to my neighbor he refused it.\"  The second man then spoke up and said, \"It is true that I sold him the ground, but I did not reserve anything he might find in it. The treasure is not mine, and therefore I am unwilling to take it.\"  The shah sat silent for a while, as if in thought. Then he said to the first man, \"Have you a son?\"  \"Yes, a young man of promise,\" was the answer.  The shah turned to the second man: \"Have you a daughter?\"  \"I have,\" answered the man, \"--a beautiful girl.\"  \"Well, then, this is my judgment. Let the son marry the daughter, if both agree, and give them the treasure as a wedding portion.\"  Alexander listened with great interest. \"You have judged wisely and rightly,\" said he to the shah, \"but in my own country we should have done differently.\"  \"What would you have done?\"  \"Well, we should have thrown both men into prison, and the treasure would have been given to the king.\"  \"And is that what you call justice?\" asked the shah.  \"We call it policy,\" said Alexander.  \"Then let me ask you a question,\" said the shah. \"Does the sun shine in your country?\"  \"Surely.\"  \"Does the rain fall there?\"  \"Oh, yes!\"  \"Is it possible! But are there any gentle, harmless animals in your fields?\"  \"A great many.\"  \"Then,\" said the shah, \"it must be that the sun shines and the rain falls for the sake of these poor beasts; for men so unjust do not deserve such blessings.\"     THE GENERAL AND THE FOX    There was once a famous Greek general whose name was Aristomenes. [Footnote: Aristomenes (_pro_. ar is tom'e neez).] He was brave and wise; and his countrymen loved him.  Once, however, in a great battle with the Spartans, his army was beaten and he was taken prisoner.  In those days, people had not learned to be kind to their enemies. In war, they were savage and cruel; for war always makes men so.  The"]]]
