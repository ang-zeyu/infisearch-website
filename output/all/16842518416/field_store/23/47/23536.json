During my year on the Columbia River, the small-pox exterminated one small remnant of a band of Indians entirely, and reduced others materially.  I do not think there was a case of recovery among them, until the doctor with the Hudson Bay Company took the matter in hand and established a hospital.  Nearly every case he treated recovered.  I never, myself, saw the treatment described in the preceding paragraph, but have heard it described by persons who have witnessed it.  The decimation among the Indians I knew of personally, and the hospital, established for their benefit, was a Hudson's Bay building not a stone's throw from my own quarters.  The death of Colonel Bliss, of the Adjutant General's department, which occurred July 5th, 1853, promoted me to the captaincy of a company then stationed at Humboldt Bay, California.  The notice reached me in September of the same year, and I very soon started to join my new command.  There was no way of reaching Humboldt at that time except to take passage on a San Francisco sailing vessel going after lumber.  Red wood, a species of cedar, which on the Pacific coast takes the place filled by white pine in the East, then abounded on the banks of Humboldt Bay.  There were extensive saw-mills engaged in preparing this lumber for the San Francisco market, and sailing vessels, used in getting it to market, furnished the only means of communication between Humboldt and the balance of the world.  I was obliged to remain in San Francisco for several days before I found a vessel.  This gave me a good opportunity of comparing the San Francisco of 1852 with that of 1853.  As before stated, there had been but one wharf in front of the city in 1852--Long Wharf.  In 1853 the town had grown out into the bay beyond what was the end of this wharf when I first saw it.  Streets and houses had been built out on piles where the year before the largest vessels visiting the port lay at anchor or tied to the wharf.  There was no filling under the streets or houses.  San Francisco presented the same general appearance as the year before; that is, eating, drinking and gambling houses were conspicuous for their number and publicity.  They were on the first floor, with doors wide open.  At all hours of the day and night in walking the streets, the eye was regaled, on every block near the water front, by the sight of players at faro. Often broken places were found in the street, large enough to let a man down into the water below.  I have but little doubt that many of the people who went to the Pacific coast in the early days of the gold excitement, and have never been heard from since, or who were heard from for a time and then ceased to write, found watery graves beneath the houses or streets built over San Francisco Bay.  Besides the gambling in cards there was gambling on a larger scale in city lots.  These were sold \"On Change,\" much as stocks are now sold on Wall Street.  Cash, at time of purchase, was always paid by the broker; but the purchaser had only to put up his margin.  He was charged at the rate of two or three per cent. a month on the difference, besides commissions.  The sand hills, some of them almost inaccessible to foot-passengers, were surveyed off and mapped into fifty vara lots--a vara being a Spanish yard.  These were sold at first at very low prices, but were sold and resold for higher prices until they went up to many thousands of dollars.  The brokers did a fine business, and so did many such purchasers as were sharp enough to quit purchasing before the final crash came.  As the city grew, the sand hills back of the town furnished material for filling up the bay under the houses and streets, and still further out. The temporary houses, first built over the water in the harbor, soon gave way to more solid structures.  The main business part of the city now is on solid ground, made where vessels of the largest class lay at anchor in the early days.  I was in San Francisco again in 1854.  Gambling houses had disappeared from public view.  The city had become staid and orderly.    CHAPTER XVI.  RESIGNATION--PRIVATE LIFE--LIFE AT GALENA--THE COMING CRISIS.  My family, all this while, was at the East.  It consisted now of a wife and two children.  I saw no chance of supporting them on the Pacific coast out of my pay as an army officer.  I concluded, therefore, to resign, and in March applied for a leave of absence until the end of the July following, tendering my resignation to take effect at the end of that time.  I left the Pacific coast very much attached to it, and with the full expectation of making it my future home.  That expectation and that hope remained uppermost in my mind until the Lieutenant-Generalcy bill was introduced into Congress in the winter of 1863-4.  The passage of that bill, and my promotion, blasted my last hope of ever becoming a citizen of the further West.  In the late summer of 1854 I rejoined my family, to find in it a son whom I had never seen, born while I was on the Isthmus of Panama.  I was now to commence, at the age of thirty-two, a new struggle for our support.  My wife had a farm near St. Louis, to which we went, but I had no means to stock it.  A house had to be built also.  I worked very hard, never losing a day because of bad weather, and accomplished the object in a moderate way.  If nothing else could be done I would load a cord of wood on a wagon and take it to the city for sale.  I managed to keep along very well until 1858, when I was attacked by fever and ague. I had suffered very severely and for a long time from this disease, while a boy in Ohio.  It lasted now over a year, and, while it did not keep me in the house, it did interfere greatly with the amount of work I was able to perform.  In the fall of 1858 I sold out my stock, crops and farming utensils at auction, and gave up farming.  In the winter I established a partnership with Harry Boggs, a cousin of Mrs.  Grant, in the real estate agency business.  I spent that winter at St. Louis myself, but did not take my family into town until the spring. Our business might have become prosperous if I had been able to wait for it to grow.  As it was, there was no more than one person could attend to, and not enough to support two families.  While a citizen of St. Louis and engaged in the real estate agency business, I was a candidate for the office of county engineer, an office of respectability and emolument which would have been very acceptable to me at that time.  The incumbent was appointed by the county court, which consisted of five members.  My opponent had the advantage of birth over me (he was a citizen by adoption) and carried off the prize.  I now withdrew from the co-partnership with Boggs, and, in May, 1860, removed to Galena, Illinois, and took a clerkship in my father's store.  While a citizen of Missouri, my first opportunity for casting a vote at a Presidential election occurred.  I had been in the army from before attaining my majority and had thought but little about politics, although I was a Whig by education and a great admirer of Mr. Clay.  But the Whig party had ceased to exist before I had an opportunity of exercising the privilege of casting a ballot; the Know-Nothing party had taken its place, but was on the wane; and the Republican party was in a chaotic state and had not yet received a name.  It had no existence in the Slave States except at points on the borders next to Free States. In St. Louis City and County, what afterwards became the Republican party was known as the Free-Soil Democracy, led by the Honorable Frank P. Blair.  Most of my neighbors had known me as an officer of the army with Whig proclivities.  They had been on the same side, and, on the death of their party, many had become Know-Nothings, or members of the American party. There was a lodge near my new home, and I was invited to join it.  I accepted the invitation; was initiated; attended a meeting just one week later, and never went to another afterwards.  I have no apologies to make for having been one week a member of the American party; for I still think native-born citizens of the United States should have as much protection, as many privileges in their native country, as those who voluntarily select it for a home.  But all secret, oath-bound political parties are dangerous to any nation, no matter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which first bring them together.  No political party can or ought to exist when one of its corner-stones is opposition to freedom of thought and to the right to worship God \"according to the dictate of one's own conscience,\" or according to the creed of any religious denomination whatever. Nevertheless, if a sect sets up its laws as binding above the State laws, wherever the two come in conflict this claim must be resisted and suppressed at whatever cost.  Up to the Mexican war there were a few out and out abolitionists, men who carried their hostility to slavery into all elections, from those for a justice of the peace up to the Presidency of the United States. They were noisy but not numerous.  But the great majority of people at the North, where slavery did not exist, were opposed to the institution, and looked upon its existence in any part of the country as unfortunate. They did not hold the States where slavery existed responsible for it; and believed that protection should be given to the right of property in slaves until some satisfactory way could be reached to be rid of the institution.  Opposition to slavery was not a creed of either political party.  In some sections more anti-slavery men belonged to the Democratic party, and in others to the Whigs.  But with the inauguration of the Mexican war, in fact with the annexation of Texas, \"the inevitable conflict\" commenced.  As the time for the Presidential election of 1856--the first at which I had the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5861"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 2. (#3)"],["body"," of voting--approached, party feeling began to run high.  The Republican party was regarded in the South and the border States not only as opposed to the extension of slavery, but as favoring the compulsory abolition of the institution without compensation to the owners.  The most horrible visions seemed to present themselves to the minds of people who, one would suppose, ought to have known better. Many educated and, otherwise, sensible persons appeared to believe that emancipation meant social equality.  Treason to the Government was openly advocated and was not rebuked.  It was evident to my mind that the election of a Republican President in 1856 meant the secession of all the Slave States, and rebellion.  Under these circumstances I preferred the success of a candidate whose election would prevent or postpone secession, to seeing the country plunged into a war the end of which no man could foretell.  With a Democrat elected by the unanimous vote of the Slave States, there could be no pretext for secession for four years.  I very much hoped that the passions of the people would subside in that time, and the catastrophe be averted altogether; if it was not, I believed the country would be better prepared to receive the shock and to resist it.  I therefore voted for James Buchanan for President.  Four years later the Republican party was successful in electing its candidate to the Presidency.  The civilized world has learned the consequence.  Four millions of human beings held as chattels have been liberated; the ballot has been given to them; the free schools of the country have been opened to their children.  The nation still lives, and the people are just as free to avoid social intimacy with the blacks as ever they were, or as they are with white people.  While living in Galena I was nominally only a clerk supporting myself and family on a stipulated salary.  In reality my position was different.  My father had never lived in Galena himself, but had established my two brothers there, the one next younger than myself in charge of the business, assisted by the youngest.  When I went there it was my father's intention to give up all connection with the business himself, and to establish his three sons in it:  but the brother who had really built up the business was sinking with consumption, and it was not thought best to make any change while he was in this condition.  He lived until September, 1861, when he succumbed to that insidious disease which always flatters its victims into the belief that they are growing better up to the close of life.  A more honorable man never transacted business.  In September, 1861, I was engaged in an employment which required all my attention elsewhere.  During the eleven months that I lived in Galena prior to the first call for volunteers, I had been strictly attentive to my business, and had made but few acquaintances other than customers and people engaged in the same line with myself.  When the election took place in November, 1860, I had not been a resident of Illinois long enough to gain citizenship and could not, therefore, vote.  I was really glad of this at the time, for my pledges would have compelled me to vote for Stephen A. Douglas, who had no possible chance of election.  The contest was really between Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Lincoln; between minority rule and rule by the majority.  I wanted, as between these candidates, to see Mr. Lincoln elected.  Excitement ran high during the canvass, and torch-light processions enlivened the scene in the generally quiet streets of Galena many nights during the campaign.  I did not parade with either party, but occasionally met with the \"wide awakes\" --Republicans--in their rooms, and superintended their drill.  It was evident, from the time of the Chicago nomination to the close of the canvass, that the election of the Republican candidate would be the signal for some of the Southern States to secede.  I still had hopes that the four years which had elapsed since the first nomination of a Presidential candidate by a party distinctly opposed to slavery extension, had given time for the extreme pro-slavery sentiment to cool down; for the Southerners to think well before they took the awful leap which they had so vehemently threatened.  But I was mistaken.  The Republican candidate was elected, and solid substantial people of the North-west, and I presume the same order of people throughout the entire North, felt very serious, but determined, after this event.  It was very much discussed whether the South would carry out its threat to secede and set up a separate government, the corner-stone of which should be, protection to the \"Divine\" institution of slavery.  For there were people who believed in the \"divinity\" of human slavery, as there are now people who believe Mormonism and Polygamy to be ordained by the Most High.  We forgive them for entertaining such notions, but forbid their practice.  It was generally believed that there would be a flurry; that some of the extreme Southern States would go so far as to pass ordinances of secession.  But the common impression was that this step was so plainly suicidal for the South, that the movement would not spread over much of the territory and would not last long.  Doubtless the founders of our government, the majority of them at least, regarded the confederation of the colonies as an experiment.  Each colony considered itself a separate government; that the confederation was for mutual protection against a foreign foe, and the prevention of strife and war among themselves.  If there had been a desire on the part of any single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while the number of States was limited to the original thirteen, I do not suppose there would have been any to contest the right, no matter how much the determination might have been regretted. The problem changed on the ratification of the Constitution by all the colonies; it changed still more when amendments were added; and if the right of any one State to withdraw continued to exist at all after the ratification of the Constitution, it certainly ceased on the formation of new States, at least so far as the new States themselves were concerned.  It was never possessed at all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi, all of which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation. Texas and the territory brought into the Union in consequence of annexation, were purchased with both blood and treasure; and Texas, with a domain greater than that of any European state except Russia, was permitted to retain as state property all the public lands within its borders.  It would have been ingratitude and injustice of the most flagrant sort for this State to withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and done to introduce her; yet, if separation had actually occurred, Texas must necessarily have gone with the South, both on account of her institutions and her geographical position. Secession was illogical as well as impracticable; it was revolution.  Now, the right of revolution is an inherent one.  When people are oppressed by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of the oppression, if they are strong enough, either by withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and substituting a government more acceptable.  But any people or part of a people who resort to this remedy, stake their lives, their property, and every claim for protection given by citizenship--on the issue.  Victory, or the conditions imposed by the conqueror--must be the result.  In the case of the war between the States it would have been the exact truth if the South had said,--\"We do not want to live with you Northern people any longer; we know our institution of slavery is obnoxious to you, and, as you are growing numerically stronger than we, it may at some time in the future be endangered.  So long as you permitted us to control the government, and with the aid of a few friends at the North to enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape of our property, we were willing to live with you.  You have been submissive to our rule heretofore; but it looks now as if you did not intend to continue so, and we will remain in the Union no longer.\" Instead of this the seceding States cried lustily,--\"Let us alone; you have no constitutional power to interfere with us.\"  Newspapers and people at the North reiterated the cry.  Individuals might ignore the constitution; but the Nation itself must not only obey it, but must enforce the strictest construction of that instrument; the construction put upon it by the Southerners themselves.  The fact is the constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to 1865.  Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring.  If they had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war between brothers.  The framers were wise in their generation and wanted to do the very best possible to secure their own liberty and independence, and that also of their descendants to the latest days.  It is preposterous to suppose that the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rules of government for all who are to come after them, and under unforeseen contingencies.  At the time of the framing of our constitution the only physical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his labor, were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rude machinery, propelled by water power, had been invented; sails to propel ships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze--but the application of stream to propel vessels against both wind and current, and machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of.
