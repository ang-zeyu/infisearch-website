In answer to the pressing of the button there came a knock at the door.  A moment later Lieutenant Blum entered.  He took in the situation at a glance.  Tom released his hold upon Captain Koenig and jumped for the lieutenant.  As the negro's arms went round the man, Jack dipped quickly into the lieutenant's pocket and produced the keys to the quarters occupied by the prisoners, and to the store room.  The lieutenant writhed in the negro's grasp and with a kick caught Tom on the right shin.  Immediately Tom released his bold and sought his brass knuckles.  Before he could strike, however, Lieutenant Blum had disappeared through the door.  Jack whipped out his revolver and fired, but the German did not stop. The lad muttered an imprecation.  \"Quick, now!\" ordered Lord Hastings.  He was calm, cool and collected.  Revolvers in the box were disposed of between the three, and then all dashed below to where the prisoners were locked.  Two men guarded the deck at this point.  Seeing their enemies bearing down on them, both opened fire.  The revolvers of Lord Hastings flashed simultaneously and the two Germans dropped.  Quickly Jack fitted one of the keys to the door, and the crews of the Algonquin and the Gloucester streamed forth.  The first man out was Captain Stoneman.  Jack gave him a pair of revolvers.  The other weapons were divided up as far as they would go.  \"To the bridge with you, Stoneman!\" cried Lord Hastings.  \"You'll find Chadwick there.  Take the bridge and hold those machine guns until we get there.  Much depends on your getting there before the enemy can recover from their surprise.\"  Stoneman dashed away.  Lord Hastings designated that the others who were armed should follow.  These hurried after Stoneman.  \"Now for the rifles!\" cried Lord Hastings.  Jack led the way and Lord Hastings and members of the Algonquin and Gloucester crews followed.  At the same moment a bugle blared above and there came the hoarse sounds of commands.  \"We've been discovered!\" shouted Jack.  \"There is no time to lose, sir.\"  He fitted a key to the door of the compartment where the rifles, ammunition and small arms were stored.  The men, perhaps sixty all told, rushed forward and grabbed weapons and ammunition.  \"I'll lead these men, Jack,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"One of those keys fits the other prisoners' compartment.  Go below and release them.  Arm them and then come on deck.  You go with him, Tom. If any of the prisoners hang back, lock them up or shoot them.  This is no time for fooling.  You other men, follow me.\"  Lord Hastings dashed on deck, closely followed by his men.  Jack wasted no time.  Quickly he descended to the deck below where the other prisoners were held.  These, too, were under guard from the outside.  Sounds of confusion from within told the lads that the prisoners had heard the sounds of firing above.  Men kicked upon the barred door.  They were eager to get out and join in the fray, the nature of which they could not tell.  The two Germans on guard there were plainly uneasy.  No orders had reached them, and they appeared afraid that the door would give beneath kicks and blows rained upon it from within; and they knew that there would be no stopping the prisoners should they break through.  Consequently they were watching the door when lack and the negro appeared in sight and the attackers had the advantage.  One swerved suddenly, however, and raised his weapon.  Jack fired and the man dropped.  Tom accounted for the second.  Then Jack opened the door.  He held up a hand as the men streamed forth.  \"Follow me and get guns!\" he shouted to make himself heard above the babel of voices.  The others understood the import of the words.  There was a wild cheer as they dashed after Jack and the negro Tom.      CHAPTER IX  THE FIGHT  Frank, on deck, was doing his work.  At the first stroke of six bells, the lad had dropped his hand to his pocket.  A moment later there came a sharp report from below.  \"Things have started moving,\" said Frank quietly.  The officer on the bridge had also caught the sound of the revolver shot.  He looked up sharply.  A moment later Lieutenant Blum dashed forward and jumped to the bridge.  He spoke hurriedly to the officer of the deck, and both made a leap for the machine guns.  Frank smiled quietly to himself.  Here was fighting in which he knew his true value.  The lad's revolver flashed.  The man nearest to the first machine gun dropped in his track.  The second man, Lieutenant Blum, touched the nearest machine gun.  Frank's revolver spoke again.  The German lieutenant pitched forward on his face.  \"So much for you!\" cried Frank.  He leaped to the bridge and covered the man at the wheel.  \"A false move and you are a dead man,\" he said.  \"Hold her steady.\"  A glance told the helmsman that the lad meant what he said.  The German kept his hand on the wheel.  Came the cries of men as those released below poured on deck in the wake of Lord Hastings.  Frank gazed in that direction.  As he did so, the man at the wheel rose suddenly, snatched the revolver from the lad's hand and before Frank could turn, brought it down heavily on his head.  Frank dropped limply to the deck.  The helmsman himself sprang toward the machine gun, while the big vessel, with no hand to guide her wallowed in the trough of the sea.  There came a hoarse command from Lord Hastings, who had seen Frank fall.  Several men fired at the helmsman and he went down.  The bridge was unmanned now but its capture was to be no sinecure.  The opposition from forward had developed considerable force and the Germans there realized that possession of the bridge by the Americans and Englishmen meant disaster.  The third officer, in command, roared out his orders and a score of heavily armed Germans from the forecastle gathered about him.  At Lord Hastings' command, his forces scattered--it would be every man for himself.  The Germans under the third officer held the forecastle and between them and the opposition amidships was the bridge.  Now more men swarmed from aft.  The British and Americans were between two fires.  A volley belched from the third officer's men.  Two Americans went down.  From their scattered positions about the deck, the allies returned the fire, and with effect, as Lord Hastings could see, for several men dropped.  \"Good work, men!\" shouted Lord Hastings.  The British commander knew that Jack, Tom and the other prisoners would be on deck in a few moments, and that if he could hold the deck until that time, the bridge might be captured by a massed attack.  But now, with the Germans guarding the bridge from the forecastle, it was well nigh impossible, for the allied sailors would be mowed down. For the same reason, the Germens in the forecastle were unable to advance upon the bridge.  Meantime the Vaterland staggered helplessly.  Suddenly there was a wild cry from forward.  On deck dashed Jack and the negro, Tom, followed by the released prisoners.  The Germans in the forecastle were panic stricken at sight of these unexpected re-enforcements for the opposition.  They poured in a withering fire, but it was returned with such deadly effect that the Germans scattered.  But the Germans aft pressed into the heat of the conflict, disregarding shots rained upon them by the allies.  Lord Hastings called his men to make a massed stand.  They gathered about him and dashed headlong at the Germans.  Revolvers replaced rifles now, for the fighting was at too close quarters for the use of the latter.  Men emptied their revolvers in the very faces of their enemies, then clubbed their weapons and continued the struggle.  As the allies turned to meet this attack, the Germans in the forecastle rallied and dashed for the bridge.  From behind them, the force led by Jack with Tom flung themselves forward.  At almost the same time consciousness returned to Frank on the bridge. Slowly he raised his head, saw the men approaching him, picked up the revolver that lay near his hand and emptied it into the face of the foe.  His second automatic leaped from his pocket and also flashed fire.  Taken by surprise, the Germans hesitated.  At the same moment Frank staggered toward the machine guns.  He gripped one, whirled it so that it covered the deck.  But he could not fire.  Lord Hastings' force was in the line of fire and to have opened up with the rapid-firer would have annihilated the allies as well as the Germans.  A bullet whistled past the lad's head and he ducked instinctively.  He emptied the second revolver into the mass of his foes and hurled the now useless weapon in their faces.  Then the Germans were upon him.  But Jack, who realized what would follow should the Germans gain control of the bridge, had urged his men to greater efforts, and these now fell upon the Germans from behind.  With absolute disregard for their own safety, and fighting side by side, Jack and the giant negro forced their way through the struggling mass.  The negro wreaked terrible havoc with his deadly pair of brass knuckles, but Jack was giving an equally good account of himself with his two clubbed revolvers.  Two men sprang to the bridge.  Frank met the first with a blow of his right fist and the man dropped back.  The second made the bridge and Frank grappled with him.  The two went down in a heap.  \"To the bridge, Tom!\" called Jack.  With a desperate effort the two broke through the mass of the enemy and leaped safely to the bridge.  Four Germans piled forward with them.  Meantime Lord Hastings' force was so hardly pressed that he for the moment lost sight of the bridge.  Under the volleys of the Germans who still stuck to the forecastle, the Americans and English threw themselves to the deck for what little shelter they could find.  There they sniped off what numbers of the enemy they could.  Then the Germans who held the forecastle charged.  There was nothing for Lord Hastings"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6072"],["title","The Boy Allies with Uncle Sam's Cruisers (#7)"],["body","do now but order his men to their feet to meet this situation.  At command, they leaped up quickly and presented a solid front to the foe.  In the foremost of the fighting was Captain Stoneman, erstwhile commander of the Algonquin.  He had long since discarded his empty automatics to favor of bare fists, and now he flung himself into the midst of the battle.  Others sprang forward with him, those who were still armed firing point blank into the mass of the foe.  The Germans gave ground.  The men who had been released last by Jack and the big negro now dashed forward with wild cries of joy and fell upon the enemy from the rear.  On the bridge, Jack, Frank and the negro Tom now were battling with fully a dozen men.  No shots were fired.  All on the bridge had exhausted their ammunition, and now fell to with butts of revolvers and their naked fists.  \"Charge 'em!\" shouted Jack suddenly, who realized that the enemy was working back so that they could get their hands on the machine guns.  Frank and the negro asked no questions.  Jack dashed forward; they followed him.  \"I'm coming, suh!\" shouted the negro.  His long arms flew about like flails, and wherever those brass knuckles struck a man went down.  Jack felled two men with as many blows.  The negro accounted for two more.  Frank dropped one to the deck.  There were still seven against three, and the Germans pressed forward with wild cries.  Again the brass knuckles found their mark and a German toppled to the deck.  Glancing around, the huge negro saw Frank locked in a close embrace with a powerful German.  The negro stepped back and struck out viciously.  The grip on Frank relaxed.  There were but five men to deal with now.  One of these Jack disposed of with a blow to the point of the chin. Frank brought his revolver crashing down on the head of another.  Tom's knuckles went home again.  There were only two Germans on the bridge now.  These turned to run. Tom stepped forward with quick strides and grasped one by the arm, twisted sharply and sent him hurling into the sea.  Then, with the rage of battle still in his heart and before Frank or Jack could stop him, he struck the remaining German a powerful blow in the face.  The man crumpled tip and lay still.  The three now were the undisputed masters of the bridge.  But along the deck the battle still raged.  Jack sprang to the nearest machine gun.  Frank and Tom each manned another.      CHAPTER X  VICTORY  \"Never mind that gun, Frank!\" shouted Jack.  \"Take the wheel!\"  Frank obeyed without hesitation.  He knew that one machine there would be as good as a dozen, and he realized that to keep the big ship on an even keel would be of great assistance.  Again Jack raised his voice.  \"Lord Hastings!\"  His hard pressed commander caught the sound of the lad's voice.  He glanced about.  \"To the bridge!\" cried Jack.  \"Get out of the line of fire, sir.\"  Lord Hastings gave a sharp order to his men.  Immediately they jumped back, and at a second command, dashed toward the bridge, fully two hundred of them.  The others lay about the deck in scattered heaps.  Realizing the import of this ruse, the Germans ran swiftly after them that they too might be out of the line of fire from the machine guns on the bridge.  But the men under Lord Hastings had acted too promptly for the Germans.  With the British and Americans out of harm's way, Jack turned the machine gun loose on the deck.  Shrieks and cries arose.  Jack stopped his fire.  That single machine gun had done more execution in one single instant than the attacking party had done in the rest of the battle.  \"Throw down your arms!\" Jack commanded.  The Germans obeyed.  \"Jack,\" said Lord Hastings, \"take twenty men and search the ship below.  Shoot any man who offers resistance.  Tom, take the wheel. Frank, take twenty men and go to the engine room and make prisoners of the stokers.\"  The two lads hurried away on their several errands.  Frank found the men in the engine room working as though nothing had happened.  In some unaccountable manner they had not heard of the fighting above.  Frank's men covered them.  There was no resistance.  Jack, descending the hatch with his men, encountered opposition in the captain's cabin.  Half a dozen men had taken refuge there and refused to emerge.  \"Come out or we shall fire through the door!\" Jack shouted.  Revolvers spoke from the inside and bullets crashed through the door. This was the German reply.  \"Break down the door, men,\" said Jack quietly.  This was the work of an instant, although one man dropped while it was being done.  The door flew inward.  A single volley greeted Jack and his men as they appeared in the doorway but the men had stooped low and none was hit.  Before the Germans could fire again, Jack and his men dashed forward. The Germans were soon overpowered.  Jack marched them back on deck.  There Lord Hastings had just accepted the surrender of the vessel from a young ordnance officer, the sole German officer left alive with the exception of Captain Koenig, who was still unconscious in his cabin.  \"Jack!\" instructed Lord Hastings, \"take fifty men and march the prisoners below and lock them up.\"  Jack touched his cap.  \"Very good, sir.\"  He selected his men, surrounded the prisoners and marched them below.  Frank appeared a few moments later with the crew of the engine room. These, too, were locked up, Lord Hastings detailed some of the victorious seamen for engine room duty, ordered the decks cleared of the dead and injured, and motioned Frank to follow him.  \"Mr. Chadwick,\" he said, \"you are my second officer.  You will hold the bridge until Mr.  Templeton, the first officer, relieves you.\"  Frank touched his cap and Lord Hastings descended below.  Half an hour later the captured raider got under way.  Jack and Lord Hastings were also on the bridge now.  \"Shape your course north, sir,\" said Lord Hastings to Jack.  \"North she is, sir,\" said Jack, passing the word along.  \"I suppose you will be interested to know where we are bound?\" asked Lord Hastings a few moments later.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Frank and Jack in a single voice.  \"New York,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"New York!\" echoed Jack.  \"I supposed of course we were bound for Liverpool or Glasgow.\"  Lord Hastings smiled.  \"No,\" he said.  \"I had offered, if successful in this venture, to turn the Vaterland over to the American government.  It will be used to transport troops to Europe.\"  \"I see, sir,\" said Frank.  \"And when shall we return to England, sir?\"  \"Not immediately, I believe.  We shall probably remain in New York until the first United States expeditionary force sets forth.  We shall probably go aboard one of the convoys.\"  \"That suits me, sir,\" said Jack.  \"Does it you, Frank?\"  \"Down to the ground,\" was Frank's reply.  \"Very well,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"Mr. Templeton, you will take the bridge.  I'll announce the watches later.  In the meantime I'll go down and have a talk with my friend, Captain Koenig.  Come along, Frank.\"  Under administering hands Captain Koenig had returned to consciousness.  He was in no amiable mood.  \"How are you, Captain?\" said Lord Hastings cheerfully, as he entered the cabin.  Captain Koenig looked at him with a savage scowl.  \"I trust you are feeling better, sir,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"No, I'm not, you blasted Britisher!\" said Captain Koenig in very good English.  \"I'm sorry, Captain.  Is there anything I can do for you until I turn you over to the United States military authorities as a prisoner of war?\"  \"Not a thing,\" declared Captain Koenig.  \"Too bad,\" commented Lord Hastings.  \"What do you say to concluding that game of chess?\"  Captain Koenig's reply was a fierce German imprecation.  \"Come, Captain,\" said Lord Hastings,  \"don't let your temper run away with you.  It is very foolish.  Why, do you not remember how calmly I took my captivity?\"  \"You had something up your sleeve,\" growled Captain Koenig.  \"Well, that's true,\" returned Lord Hastings, \"and I'm glad that you haven't.  Until we reach New York, Captain, you shall be kept under close guard here.  If there is anything you want, please let me know.\"  Lord Hastings bowed and left the German commander to his own reflections.  Half an hour later, on deck, Frank again encountered Elizabeth Wheaton.  \"It was splendid!\" exclaimed the girl.  \"I am so sorry I doubted you in the first place.\"  \"I guess it was only natural,\" said Frank, with a smile.  \"I guess I would have done as you did under the circumstances. How is your mother?\"  \"She is as happy as she can be.  She says that she knew the American navy would look out for us.\"  \"You might tell her,\" said Frank, with a smile, \"that it was the British navy that pulled off this job, although I am an American.  Lord Hastings and Mr. Templeton are British.\"  \"I guess I won't tell her,\" laughed the girl.  \"It would spoil it for her.  She thinks there is nothing like the American navy.  But what are your duties now?\"  \"Well,\" said Frank, \"I am the second officer of this ship, rank of lieutenant.  Mr. Templeton is the first officer.\"  \"Is that so?\" asked the girl in some surprise.  \"You are so young for such an important position.\"  Frank turned red.  \"I--I--I'm not so awfully young,\" he stammered.  \"May be not,\" admitted Miss Wheaton, with a smile,  \"but I'll wager you are not over twenty.\"  \"I'm nineteen,\" said Frank.  \"Just a year older than I am,\" mused the girl, \"and still, think of what a lot of excitement you have been through.\"  \"Were you frightened during the fight?\" asked Frank, changing the subject.  \"Not a bit.  I knew you would capture the ship.  Mother wasn't frightened either, but some of the others were.  It must have been terrible.\"  \"It was,\" said Frank simply.  Frank took the bridge at 6 o'clock and Jack turned in.  And, as the big ship sailed smoothly along during the long hours of the night, Frank gazed out over the deep with a strange sensation in his breast.  He was going back to his own country for the"]]]
