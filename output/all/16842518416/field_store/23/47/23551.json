Burnside to his right, then Hancock, and Wright on the extreme right, extending towards Hanover Court House, six miles south-east of it.  Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry was watching our left front towards Cold Harbor.  Wilson with his division on our right was sent to get on the Virginia Central Railroad and destroy it as far back as possible.  He got possession of Hanover Court House the next day after a skirmish with Young's cavalry brigade.  The enemy attacked Sheridan's pickets, but reinforcements were sent up and the attack was speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distance towards Cold Harbor.    CHAPTER LV.  ADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR--AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR--BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR --CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE--RETROSPECTIVE.  On the 31st Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor.  He found it intrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry.  A hard fight ensued but the place was carried.  The enemy well knew the importance of Cold Harbor to us, and seemed determined that we should not hold it.  He returned with such a large force that Sheridan was about withdrawing without making any effort to hold it against such odds; but about the time he commenced the evacuation he received orders to hold the place at all hazards, until reinforcements could be sent to him.  He speedily turned the rebel works to face against them and placed his men in position for defence.  Night came on before the enemy was ready for assault.  Wright's corps was ordered early in the evening to march directly to Cold Harbor passing by the rear of the army.  It was expected to arrive by daylight or before; but the night was dark and the distance great, so that it was nine o'clock the 1st of June before it reached its destination.  Before the arrival of Wright the enemy had made two assaults on Sheridan, both of which were repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy.  Wright's corps coming up, there was no further assault on Cold Harbor.  Smith, who was coming up from White House, was also directed to march directly to Cold Harbor, and was expected early on the morning of the 1st of June; but by some blunder the order which reached Smith directed him to Newcastle instead of Cold Harbor.  Through this blunder Smith did not reach his destination until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then with tired and worn-out men from their long and dusty march.  He landed twelve thousand five hundred men from Butler's command, but a division was left at White House temporarily and many men had fallen out of ranks in their long march.  Before the removal of Wright's corps from our right, after dark on the 31st, the two lines, Federal and Confederate, were so close together at that point that either side could detect directly any movement made by the other.  Finding at daylight that Wright had left his front, Lee evidently divined that he had gone to our left.  At all events, soon after light on the 1st of June Anderson, who commanded the corps on Lee's left, was seen moving along Warren's front.  Warren was ordered to attack him vigorously in flank, while Wright was directed to move out and get on his front.  Warren fired his artillery at the enemy; but lost so much time in making ready that the enemy got by, and at three o'clock he reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in his front, and besides his lines were so long that he had no mass of troops to move with.  He seemed to have forgotten that lines in rear of an army hold themselves while their defenders are fighting in their front.  Wright reconnoitred some distance to his front:  but the enemy finding Old Cold Harbor already taken had halted and fortified some distance west.  By six o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to make an assault.  In front of both the ground was clear for several hundred yards and then became wooded.  Both charged across this open space and into the wood, capturing and holding the first line of rifle-pits of the enemy, and also capturing seven or eight hundred prisoners.  While this was going on, the enemy charged Warren three separate times with vigor, but were repulsed each time with loss.  There was no officer more capable, nor one more prompt in acting, than Warren when the enemy forced him to it.  There was also an attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's corps at the same time; but it was feeble and probably only intended to relieve Anderson who was being pressed by Wright and Smith.  During the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view of dispossessing us of the important position we had gained, but without effecting their object.  Hancock was moved from his place in line during the night and ordered to the left of Wright.  I expected to take the offensive on the morning of the 2d, but the night was so dark, the heat and dust so excessive and the roads so intricate and hard to keep, that the head of column only reached Old Cold Harbor at six o'clock, but was in position at 7.30 A.M. Preparations were made for an attack in the afternoon, but did not take place until the next morning.  Warren's corps was moved to the left to connect with Smith:  Hancock's corps was got into position to the left of Wright's, and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in reserve. While Warren and Burnside were making these changes the enemy came out several times and attacked them, capturing several hundred prisoners.  The attacks were repulsed, but not followed up as they should have been.  I was so annoyed at this that I directed Meade to instruct his corps commanders that they should seize all such opportunities when they occurred, and not wait for orders, all of our manoeuvres being made for the very purpose of getting the enemy out of his cover.  On this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia Central Railroad, having damaged it considerably.  But, like ourselves, the rebels had become experts in repairing such damage.  Sherman, in his memoirs, relates an anecdote of his campaign to Atlanta that well illustrates this point.  The rebel cavalry lurking in his rear to burn bridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted at hearing trains go whistling by within a few hours after a bridge had been burned, that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels. One of them said, \"No use, boys, Old Sherman carries duplicate tunnels with him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up; better save your powder.\"  Sheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the Chickahominy, to find crossings and the condition of the roads.  He reported favorably.  During the night Lee moved his left up to make his line correspond to ours.  His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor. Mine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy, with a division of cavalry guarding our right.  An assault was ordered for the 3d, to be made mainly by the corps of Hancock, Wright and Smith; but Warren and Burnside were to support it by threatening Lee's left, and to attack with great earnestness if he should either reinforce more threatened points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorable opportunity should present itself.  The corps commanders were to select the points in their respective fronts where they would make their assaults.  The move was to commence at half-past four in the morning.  Hancock sent Barlow and Gibbon forward at the appointed hour, with Birney as a reserve.  Barlow pushed forward with great vigor, under a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry, through thickets and swamps.  Notwithstanding all the resistance of the enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome, he carried a position occupied by the enemy outside their main line where the road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter for troops as if it had been made for that purpose.  Three pieces of artillery had been captured here, and several hundred prisoners.  The guns were immediately turned against the men who had just been using them.  No (*33) assistance coming to him, he (Barlow) intrenched under fire and continued to hold his place.  Gibbon was not so fortunate in his front.  He found the ground over which he had to pass cut up with deep ravines, and a morass difficult to cross.  But his men struggled on until some of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy. Gibbon gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left, and here he intrenched and held fast.  Wright's corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle-pits in their front, but accomplished nothing more.  Smith's corps also gained the outer rifle-pits in its front.  The ground over which this corps (18th) had to move was the most exposed of any over which charges were made.  An open plain intervened between the contending forces at this point, which was exposed both to a direct and a cross fire.  Smith, however, finding a ravine running towards his front, sufficiently deep to protect men in it from cross fire, and somewhat from a direct fire, put Martindale's division in it, and with Brooks supporting him on the left and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the outer--probably picket--rifle-pits.  Warren and Burnside also advanced and gained ground--which brought the whole army on one line.  This assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to compensate: but the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence sufficiently to induce him to take the offensive.  In fact, nowhere after the battle of the Wilderness did Lee show any disposition to leave his defences far behind him.  Fighting was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning.  At eleven o'clock I started to visit all the corps commanders to see for myself the different positions gained and to get their opinion of the practicability of doing anything more in their respective fronts.  Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong to make any further assault"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5864"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 5. (#6)"],["body","success.  Wright thought he could gain the lines of the enemy, but it would require the cooperation of Hancock's and Smith's corps.  Smith thought a lodgment possible, but was not sanguine:  Burnside thought something could be done in his front, but Warren differed.  I concluded, therefore to make no more assaults, and a little after twelve directed in the following letter that all offensive action should cease.   COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864.-12.30 P.M. MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,  Commanding A. P.  The opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case an assault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of farther advance for the present.  Hold our most advanced positions and strengthen them. Whilst on the defensive our line may be contracted from the right if practicable.  Reconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and advances made to advantageous positions by regular approaches. To aid the expedition under General Hunter it is necessary that we should detain all the army now with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg.  To do this effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of the intrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there.  Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy should break through General Smith's lines, and all should be ready to resist an assault.  U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.   The remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we now held.  By night we were as strong against Lee as he was against us.  During the night the enemy quitted our right front, abandoning some of their wounded, and without burying their dead.  These we were able to care for.  But there were many dead and wounded men between the lines of the contending forces, which were now close together, who could not be cared for without a cessation of hostilities.  So I wrote the following:   COLD HARBOR, VA., June 5, 1864.  GENERAL R.  E. LEE, Commanding Confederate Army.  It is reported to me that there are wounded men, probably of both armies, now lying exposed and suffering between the lines occupied respectively by the two armies.  Humanity would dictate that some provision should be made to provide against such hardships.  I would propose, therefore, that hereafter, when no battle is raging, either party be authorized to send to any point between the pickets or skirmish lines, unarmed men bearing litters to pick up their dead or wounded, without being fired upon by the other party.  Any other method, equally fair to both parties, you may propose for meeting the end desired will be accepted by me.  U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.   Lee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead to misunderstanding, and proposed that in future, when either party wished to remove their dead and wounded, a flag of truce be sent.  I answered this immediately by saying:   COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.  GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.  Your communication of yesterday's date is received.  I will send immediately, as you propose, to collect the dead and wounded between the lines of the two armies, and will also instruct that you be allowed to do the same.  I propose that the time for doing this be between the hours of 12 M. and 3 P.M. to-day.  I will direct all parties going out to bear a white flag, and not to attempt to go beyond where we have dead or wounded, and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops.  U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.   Lee's response was that he could not consent to the burial of the dead and removal of the wounded in the way I proposed, but when either party desired such permission it should be asked for by flag of truce and he had directed that any parties I may have sent out, as mentioned in my letter, to be turned back.  I answered:   COLD HARBOR, VA, June 6, 1864.  GENERAL R. E. LEE. Commanding Army, N. Va.  The knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of attention, between the two armies, compels me to ask a suspension of hostilities for sufficient time to collect them in, say two hours.  Permit me to say that the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me, and the same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish to send out on the same duty without further application.  U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.   Lee acceded to this; but delays in transmitting the correspondence brought it to the 7th of June--forty-eight hours after it commenced --before parties were got out to collect the men left upon the field. In the meantime all but two of the wounded had died.  And I wrote to Lee:   COLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864. 10.30 A.M.  GEN. R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.  I regret that your note of seven P.M. yesterday should have been received at the nearest corps headquarters, to where it was delivered, after the hour which had been given for the removal of the dead and wounded had expired; 10.45 P.M. was the hour at which it was received at corps headquarters, and between eleven and twelve it reached my headquarters.  As a consequence, it was not understood by the troops of this army that there was a cessation of hostilities for the purpose of collecting the dead and wounded, and none were collected.  Two officers and six men of the 8th and 25th North Carolina Regts., who were out in search of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments, were captured and brought into our lines, owing to this want of understanding.  I regret this, but will state that as soon as I learned the fact, I directed that they should not be held as prisoners, but must be returned to their commands.  These officers and men having been carelessly brought through our lines to the rear have not determined whether they will be sent back the way they came, or whether they will be sent by some other route.  Regretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of wounded men left upon the battle-field have been rendered nugatory, I remain, &c.,  U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.   I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.  I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22d of May, 1863, at Vicksburg.  At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained.  Indeed, the advantages other than those of relative losses, were on the Confederate side. Before that, the Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired a wholesome regard for the courage, endurance, and soldierly qualities generally of the Army of the Potomac.  They no longer wanted to fight them \"one Confederate to five Yanks.\"  Indeed, they seemed to have given up any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the open field.  They had come to much prefer breastworks in their front to the Army of the Potomac.  This charge seemed to revive their hopes temporarily; but it was of short duration.  The effect upon the Army of the Potomac was the reverse.  When we reached the James River, however, all effects of the battle of Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared.  There was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg.  We were in a Southern climate, at the beginning of the hot season.  The Army of the Tennessee had won five successive victories over the garrison of Vicksburg in the three preceding weeks.  They had driven a portion of that army from Port Gibson with considerable loss, after having flanked them out of their stronghold at Grand Gulf.  They had attacked another portion of the same army at Raymond, more than fifty miles farther in the interior of the State, and driven them back into Jackson with great loss in killed, wounded, captured and missing, besides loss of large and small arms:  they had captured the capital of the State of Mississippi, with a large amount of materials of war and manufactures.  Only a few days before, they had beaten the enemy then penned up in the town first at Champion's Hill, next at Big Black River Bridge, inflicting upon him a loss of fifteen thousand or more men (including those cut off from returning) besides large losses in arms and ammunition.  The Army of the Tennessee had come to believe that they could beat their antagonist under any circumstances.  There was no telling how long a regular siege might last.  As I have stated, it was the beginning of the hot season in a Southern climate.  There was no telling what the casualties might be among Northern troops working and living in trenches, drinking surface water filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.  If Vicksburg could have been carried in May, it would not only have saved the army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the bullets of the enemy, but it would have given us a splendid army, well equipped and officered, to operate elsewhere with. These are reasons justifying the assault.  The only benefit we gained--and it was a slight one for so great a sacrifice--was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenches after that, being satisfied with digging the enemy out.  Had the assault not been made, I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in the siege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it would have proven successful, and would have saved life, health and comfort.    CHAPTER LVI.  LEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES--GENERAL LEE --VISIT TO BUTLER--THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG--THE INVESTMENT OF PETERSBURG.  Lee's position was now so near Richmond, and the intervening swamps of the Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in the face of an enemy, that I determined to make my next left flank move carry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River. (*34) Preparations for this were promptly commenced. The move was a hazardous one to make:  the Chickahominy River, with its marshy and heavily timbered approaches, had to be crossed; all the bridges over it east of Lee were destroyed; the enemy had a shorter line and better roads to travel on to confront me in "]]]
