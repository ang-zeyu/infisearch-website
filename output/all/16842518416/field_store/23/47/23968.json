Harry's seat was by the engine and Frank sat at the steering wheel, which manipulated the dipping and diving rudders as well as the rearward steering surface. One of his feet was on the brake--an automatic contrivance that cut off the spark. The other reposed on the foot pump which was used in case anything went wrong with the force-feed lubrication.  \"All right,\" said Frank, twisting the valve that sent the gasolene flowing to the carburetor and adjusting the switch.  Billy could stand it no longer. He had been watching with anxious eyes the preparations and apparently the boys were going to fly without him.  \"Say, Frank,\" he began hesitatingly, \"I don't suppose you could--\"  Frank turned and saw the wistful look in the young reporter's eyes.  \"Take you up?\" he said, with a laugh at Billy's downcast appearance.  Billy nodded.  \"Well, there's not much room for passengers the way she is fixed at present,\" laughed Harry catching Frank's mirth, \"but if you want to squeeze in by me here, you can. Here, Le Blanc, bring out that spare seat.\"  A few seconds later the delighted reporter was sitting on a small aluminum seat fitted with clamps to screw to the framework, and handles to grasp hold of tightly when the craft was in mid-air.  \"Let her go,\" cried Frank, as soon as the delighted Billy had taken his place.  Sanford and Le Blanc, one at each of the propellers, gave them a few twists, and after about the third silent revolution there came the startling roar of the exhaust that told the boys that all the cylinders were getting down to work. Blue flames and smoke belched out of the vents and the mechanics sprang back, as the propellers whirled round at a pace that made them seem blurred shadows.  \"Hang on till I get up speed,\" shouted Frank to the two mechanics, who, with several volunteer helpers, seized hold of the rear framework and held the struggling aeroplane back with all their might. Her frame shook as if it was being swept by some mighty convulsion. The racket was terrific, ear-splitting. The wind from the propellers blew hats in every direction and streamed out the hair of the men holding the aeroplane back, as if they had been poking their faces into an electric fan.  Faster and faster the propellers revolved, as Frank increased the power of his mixture and advanced the spark. At last, when the men holding the craft were shouting that they couldn't hang on much longer, Frank dropped his hand, the signal that the craft was to be released.  Like a scared jack-rabbit, the big-winged craft shot forward over the uneven ground at race-horse speed. Several boys on bicycles, who started after the air-ship, were speedily distanced.  After a short run, Frank jerked forward his control wheel, and the Golden Eagle, amid a cheer that was of course inaudible to the boys above the uproar of the engine, shot upward into the blue.  A few seconds later there was another roar of applause as the black Buzzard darted forward, and was soon soaring upward in pursuit of the speedy Golden Eagle. Old Schmidt in his monoplane was the next off--the crowd howling with mirth as the queer green contrivance scuttled over the ground in a series of spasmodic hops, just like its grasshopper namesake. Then came Gladwin, the novice, and a half dozen others. Presently the air above the plains was full of ambitious air craft, but with the exception of old Schmidt, who rose to a height of about a hundred feet and contented himself with circling about the grounds, none of them made any but the shortest of flights.  The attention of the crowd, therefore, naturally centered on the two rivals--as they were universally conceded to be--the Golden Eagle and the Buzzard. There was no difficulty in telling the craft apart, as they circled about high above the now crowded grounds. The spirit of emulation seemed to have seized on Malvoise. He followed the boys closely, and every feat they performed he attempted to imitate.  Frank at first contented himself with practicing swoops and glides, but after a while, tiring of this, he headed his craft due east and the Golden Eagle was soon a diminishing speck against the sky. The crowd watched till the big 'plane became a pin point and then vanished altogether. The Buzzard was off after them in a flash and the crowd cheered her just as impartially as they had the boys, as the graceful, black flyer stopped her soaring and headed off in the direction in which the Golden Eagle had rapidly vanished.  Before she had gone a mile, though, it was apparent to the watchers that something was wrong. A cloud of black smoke enveloped her engine and she wobbled badly. A rush across the field began. Suddenly the black aeroplane made a dash downward at a speed that seemed as if her driver had lost control of her altogether.  \"He'll be dashed to death,\" cried the crowd, as they saw the craft shoot downward.  Indeed it seemed so.  But Malvoise was too experienced an aviator to be caught napping. As soon as his engine began to miss fire and to smoke, he had set his guiding planes at a sharp angle and dropped in the manner described.  Had the Buzzard not been fitted with air-cushion buffers on her landing wheels and steel springs on the skids that supported her stern, a serious accident must have inevitably occurred. But, as it was, the Frenchman only received a severe jarring and was scowling over his engine when the crowd rushed down on him.  As the crowd of curious onlookers swept down on the disabled aeroplane and her furious driver, a loud \"honk-honk\" was heard and a big touring car came dashing across the plain. The people scattered right and left as soon as it was apparent that the car's destination was the stranded Buzzard.  Beside its driver, the car had only a single occupant, an old man it seemed by the tuft of gray hair that was projected from his chin, and which was all that could be seen of his face. The rest of his features were covered by a motoring mask with large glass eye-holes that made him look not unlike a goggle-eyed frog.  \"Come here, Malvoise,\" croaked the newcomer, in a voice strangely like that of the creature he remotely resembled.  The Frenchman instantly left his engine and hurried to the side of the automobile. The two conversed in low tones, though it was easy to see that the old man was in a violent rage.  \"I tell you the Buzzard must win,\" he concluded, after storming at Malvoise for an accident that had really been no fault of his. \"I've put up a $50,000 plant for the manufacture of aeroplanes of her type and I've got to have that cup in order to sell them.\"  \"I told you, Mr. Barr,\" rejoined the Frenchman, \"that I had found a man who would do what we want. I told you that over the 'phone last night, you recollect.\"  \"Oh, yes, I recollect,\" croaked the old man impatiently, \"but he doesn't seem to have done much. You are sure we have no other dangerous rivals?\"  \"Quite,\" was the reply. \"Old Schmidt's monoplane is the only other one that comes near us and we can easily outdistance her.\"  \"Good! that only leaves the Golden Eagle to contest for the cup with us.\"  \"Yes, and she is never going to get it,\" grinned the Frenchman.  \"She must not,\" said the old man, earnestly, \"I owe those boys a grudge for the way they robbed me of my ivory. I never found the other tusks they said they had left behind either. I believe that ill-favored black rascal, Sikaso, got them.\"  \"You leave it to me,\" was the rejoinder of the Frenchman, to whom the latter part of this speech had been incomprehensible of course, \"the Buzzard will win the cup, never fear.\"  At this moment, the heavy-set figure of Sanborn was seen shouldering its way through the crowd.  \"Why here's our man now,\" whispered Malvoise to old Barr. \"This is the mechanic of the Chester boys of whom I spoke to you.\"  Old Barr greeted Sanborn graciously, but he seemed somewhat surprised when the mechanic, after some talk, suddenly said:  \"I have something important to tell you, Mr. Barr.\"  \"What is it?\" demanded the magnate, not without impatience.  \"I cannot tell you here, somebody might overhear us. I'll take a ride with you in your car.\"  \"But it won't do for the Chester boys to see us together.\"  \"They won't be back for some time. They are off on a long flight. I can tell you my proposition and be back at the aerodrome by the time they return.\"  \"Very well, I will hear what you have to say.\"  As the car moved slowly off, the chauffeur steering it carefully among the scattered crowd, the two occupants of the tonneau were engaged in a conversation that must have been deeply interesting, judging from old Barr's gestures and exclamations. If one could have penetrated behind his mask they would have seen his thin lips curled in a delighted smile and his eyes glisten with cupidity at the proposition Sanborn was craftily unfolding.     CHAPTER IV.  EBEN JOYCE APPEARS.   Hardly had the automobile containing the old man and the machinist vanished down the road in a cloud of dust before a shout from the crowd proclaimed that the Golden Eagle was once more in sight. At first a mere speck against the blue, she rapidly assumed shape and was soon circling above the heads of the onlookers, her engine droning steadily, as if she had been some gigantic beetle.  \"I say, Frank, this is glorious. How much better she flies than when she was laden down with her cabin and fittings.\"  Billy shouted this comment at the top of his voice, so as to be heard by the others above the roar of the engine.  Far below them--spread out like the figures on a carpet--they could see the plain; with its big crowd massed in one corner and dozens of tiny figures scuttling about so as to get a better view of the air-craft by getting right underneath it.  \"Watch, I'm going to give them a scare.\"  It was Frank who spoke, and, as he did"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6149"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Treasure Quest; Or, The Golden Galleon (#4)"],["body","o, he shoved forward his control-wheel post till the front elevating planes were dropped at an acute angle. There was a sharp snap as he opened the circuit and the roar of the propellers came to a sudden stop.  \"Good Lord, Frank, what are you going to do?\" gasped Billy, to whom floating in the air with the engine cut out was a new and somewhat terrifying sensation.  \"Glide,\" was the reply.  \"Hold on tight now!\"  Suddenly the great craft began to descend in a quick dropping rush that sent the air tingling against Billy's cheeks as though they had been plunging through a hailstorm. There was a mighty buzzing in his ears, and every stay and wire on the big craft sang its own song, as the wind rushed through them as if the Golden Eagle had been converted into a monster Aeolian harp.  Down and down they dropped.  A sudden fear shot into Billy's mind.  What if Frank couldn't start the engine again?  They would be dashed to death to a certainty.  And now it seemed that instead of the aeroplane gliding down on the earth that the earth was rushing upward with terrific velocity to meet them.  Just as Billy was about to shout aloud in actual terror at the disaster that seemed unavoidable, there was a sharp \"click\" as Frank closed the circuit with his emergency foot pedal and the engine began to revolve once more.  Her two propellers shoving her ahead with a mighty push, the big aeroplane began to shoot upwards again in a long swinging arc. She had dropped to within twenty feet of the ground.  It was a hair-raising feat and the crowd that had scattered in terror, as the monster craft bore down on them, quickly reassembled and sent up a cheer.  There was an even heavier scowl than his habitual frown on the face of Malvoise as, having completed his repairs on the engine that had caused him to make such an abrupt descent, he prepared to go up once more.  \"Sacre!\" he muttered, \"those pigs of American boys would certainly get the cup if it wasn't for my foresight in providing against such an emergency.\"  The crowd scampered across the field to the Frenchman's side as it was seen he was about to take the air again, and a dozen volunteers laid on to the rear frames of his craft and held her back while he started the engine. The Frenchman took his seat with deliberation and adjusted his gloves with care. It was easy to see that he fairly reveled in the admiration he excited.  Just as the Frenchman was about to start his engine, preparatory to giving the word to let go, there was a shout from the crowd and cries of:  \"Let him through.\"  \"No, keep him out.\"  \"Who is he, anyhow?\"  \"Aw, he's an old man; let him get through.\"  \"He's crazy.\"  \"No, he isn't.\"  \"I am not crazy,\" came in a shrill, cracked voice, \"unless it is with my wrongs.\"  Malvoise looked up quickly.  He saw an old man with long, flowing gray hair and clothes of the shabbiest making his way toward him. Close behind followed a young woman of unusual beauty, who seemed to be endeavoring to stop the aged man from going further. But he was not to be restrained. In a few strides he was at the side of the Buzzard, and gazing with piercing eyes into the French aviator's face.  \"Well, what do you want, old man?\" asked Malvoise sharply.  \"I want the world to know that the Buzzard is my invention, my design, the child of my brain from her top-plane to her landing wheels;\" shrilled the old man, who seemed beside himself with excitement.  \"Father, do be calm, I beg of you,\" entreated the young woman.  \"Calm, child! how can I be calm when I realize that I have been robbed of the work of years by the craftiness of this old man, Barr?\"  \"Hush!\" exclaimed the Frenchman, as the old man voiced the name of his employer, \"don't talk so loud. I know who you are now. You are Eben Joyce, the inventor.\"  \"Yes, I am,\" replied the old man in a lower voice, for he too saw that the more curious members of the crowd were pressing so close to them that every word of their conversation must have been audible. \"I am indeed Eben Joyce, the unfortunate inventor from whom Luther Barr by trickery secured my working drawings and specifications for the Buzzard. For a paltry five hundred I sold them all to him on the understanding that I was to have a share in the business. There will be millions in it--millions in it for him, but not a cent for me; for the agreement that I foolishly signed contains a clause that resigns all my interest in the Buzzards. Fool that I was, in my lack of knowledge of business trickery, I did not realize what the cunningly-worded sentence meant till it was too late. The five hundred went to pay my debts, and my daughter and I now face starvation.\"  \"Well, that's none of my business,\" was the brutal reply. \"I simply am here to drive the Buzzards, not to talk about them.\"  \"What!\" stammered the old man, \"will you have no pity on us nor even direct where we may find Luther Barr if he is on the grounds?\"  \"I can't waste any time on you, I tell you,\" cried the Frenchman, his eye scanning the sky, where the Golden Eagle was maneuvering in circles and swoops.  \"Moreover,\" went on Malvoise, \"I should not advise you to mention Barr's name as the manufacturer of the Buzzards. He has a business deal on in which it is important he should not be known as an aeroplane speculator. If he learns that you are giving his secrets away, he will make it hot for you, I can tell you. You were sent to Bellevue yesterday, were you not?\"  \"I was--yes,\" pitifully cried the old man, \"but I was at once released, and it was with money given me by one of the doctors who heard my story and pitied me that I came down here to-day to find Luther Barr and see whether--although in law he owes me nothing--whether I could not persuade him to at least give me something to keep the wolf from the door till I have perfected my new automatic balancing device for air-craft.\"  As he spoke, the old man's eyes kindled with pride at the achievement he hoped to accomplish. He shook off the touch of his daughter's hand on his ragged coat-sleeve. In his kindling enthusiasm he seemed to have forgotten his cares and anxieties.  \"Oh, sir,\" he went on eagerly, \"it would take very little money now before the invention is ready and if Mr. Barr could find it in his heart to help me I would gladly share the proceeds with him. It is the most needed improvement of the age for air-craft and--\"  \"Oh, you are like all crazy inventors,\" brutally blurted out Malvoise, \"every idea that enters your cracked brain you think is the greatest improvement of the age, as you say. What good would your inventions be anyway without money to back them up--they'd only be junk for the scrap pile.\"  The old man's eyes filled with tears as the Frenchman began his rough speech, but the look in them changed rapidly to one of amazed anger as the aviator continued. Drawing himself up to his full height the old man seemed about to launch a terrific denunciation at the other when his daughter once more intervened.  \"Come, father,\" she said gently, \"we shall gain nothing by remaining here. You have been robbed of your invention and it is evident that Mr. Barr means to adhere closely to what he and his like call business methods. Come, let us get back to the city and--\"  Her words were cut short by a shout from Malvoise. He started up his engine suddenly and before the old man could step back out of the way, the helpers, taken by surprise, let go of the rear structure to which they had been clinging.  \"Out of my way!\" yelled Malvoise, as like some huge juggernaut the black aeroplane bore down on old Eben Joyce. But the warning came too late.  A horrified cry of:  \"He's killed!\" went up from the crowd, as the end of one of the planes struck the old man and knocked him on to the grass with crashing force.  His daughter shrieked aloud as she saw the accident and rushed to her father's side as the Buzzard swept on.  Old Mr. Joyce lay very still. There was a deep gash in his head where the aeroplane had struck him.  In the midst of the excitement there fell over the crowd a dark shadow. Everybody looked up to see what had caused it, and there, right above them, was the Golden Eagle. Frank had seen the crowd and driven the aeroplane above it to see what was the matter.  The next minute the great aeroplane glided groundward and landed within a few feet of the crowd. The press made way as the Eagle's occupants hastened to the side of the wounded man.  \"Here, Harry, here, Billy, carry him to our shed and lay him on one of the cots,\" commanded Frank. \"I'll tell Le Blanc to get on his motor cycle and hurry back with a doctor.\"  The boys picked the unconscious man up and carried him to the Golden Eagle's shed. His pitiful emaciation made their task an easy one. The unfortunate old man was reduced almost to a skeleton.  \"Oh, thank you so much, sir,\" exclaimed Eben Joyce's daughter, clasping her hands gratefully, you--you don't think that he is badly hurt, do you?\"  \"Why, he has a nasty cut,\" replied Frank, who had hastily examined it, \"but I think it is only a flesh wound. He'll pull through, never fear. You are a relative of his, miss?\"  \"I am his daughter,\" exclaimed the girl.  At this moment, Malvoise, who had checked the Buzzard and dismounted, hastened up. His face was livid and his hands shook as though with palsy.  \"It was an accident--it was all an accident,\" he cried. \"I didn't mean to. Is--is he dead?\"  \"He is not,--and he is not likely to die,\" sternly replied Frank, looking full into the Frenchman's cringing face, \"do you know who he is?\"  \"Do I know who he is?\" repeated the Frenchman slowly, \"why, no, monsieur, I never saw him before in my life.\"     CHAPTER V.  A STRANGE STORY.   It was not long before, under the friendly administrations of the boys, Old Eben Joyce opened his eyes on a cot in their aerodrome and gave a long sigh. It was several minutes, however, before he realized what had happened.  \"How can I thank you--?\" he concluded, after he had informed the"]]]
