See grand Niagara's stream majestic glide,   The venturous steamer floating on its tide:   Its limpid waters draining half a world,   Into the yawning gulf are headlong hurled,   And for a moment lose the light of day,--   Dash on the rocks--then rise in misty spray.    The playful sunbeams trembling kiss its tears,   And from this loved embrace the bow appears;   Commingling colors of the liveliest hue   From purple red, to yellow, pink, and blue.   These mingling join the sportive, airy dance,   Their beauty half concealed from vulgar glance;   Now veil'd in clouds--now bursting to the view   In blushing modesty, the dance renew;   While music rolls in awful, solemn sound,   Heard in the distance, many leagues around.    Or turn to Tequendama's awful steep,   See wild Bogota's waters boldy leap,   Down from the lofty Andes' heights of snow,   To flowery plains, where spring's soft breezes blow:   'Mid scenes of majesty unrival'd stand,   And view the wonders of Columbia's land.   Our climate stretching far through every zone,   Presents variety elsewhere unknown.   Lo! in the North eternal winter reigns,   And binds the ocean in his icy chains;   Locked in the stupor of his cold embrace   All nature seems to sleep:--yet here we trace   Some signs of life,--of joy, and happiness,   Some icy cottage of domestic bliss,   Where love sits smiling, (from the blast secure)   In native modesty,--with soul as pure,   And chaste, and lovely, as their virgin snows,   While to the chase her lord, or lover goes;   And if per chance he takes a Bear, or Seal,   Amid the dangers of the icy field,   Returns in triumph to his humble cot   Where lost in love his troubles are forgot.   Our northern states present a clime severe,   Where wintry blasts are howling half the year;   But spring arising from its wintry tomb,   Renew'd in freshness sheds a sweet perfume;   Decked in pure robes of purple, white or green,   Adorned with flowrets bright:--O, lovely scene!   Melodious sounds of music, soft and sweet   Thrill through the air,--it's joyous welcome greet.   There autumn's richest blessings crown the year,   And there the rose on beauty's cheek appears.    Our southern climes for mildness may compare,   With Italy, and France, whose gentle air   Became the subject of the Poet's dream,   Or breathed in music soft, the lover's theme.   There rapturous passions kindle in the soul   Their warmest fires,--impatient of control:   There love's soft graces beam in woman's eye   And beauty's cheek is tinged with paler dye.   There balmy sweets perfume the breath of morn,   And shady groves the noonday walks adorn;   While gentle zephyrs kiss the blushing flowers,   And healthful breezes cool the evening hours.   Our soil, with Eden's garden would compare,   Nay more,--forbidden fruit was growing there;   But here the trees of life and knowledge stand reveal'd,   And free to all,--no poison is conceal'd   In wisdom's fruit,--Our Eves may satisfy   Their souls with knowledge here; nor fear to die.    O, MISSOURI, HOW ART THOU FALLEN!  WRITTEN IN PRISON.    Missouri, a country how sad and how low,       How fallen from glory, from freedom, from pride,   O, would that oblivion its mantle would throw       O'er thee, and the depth of thy wickedness hide.    Thou should'st never rejoice--think not of the day       When Columbia for freedom first struggled so bold,   When thousands assembled in battle array,       The star-spangled banner of freedom unfurled;    Think not of the patriots that bled in her cause,       Who met all undaunted the foemen's dark brow,   They gave to their country beneficent laws       Of right and protection but where are they now?    Disturb not the rest of the free and the brave,       Enshrined deep in honor they sweetly repose,   They swore that the banner of freedom should wave       O'er their dear native land regardless of foes,    But thou, O Missouri, hast trampled on all       That free men would fight for or patriots feel   O thou queen of the west how great is thy fall--       Thy wounds deep and deadly no balsam can heal.    Let us fly, let us fly to the land where the light       Of Liberty's stars still illumine each spot,   Where the cottager's smile for ever is bright,       And the chains of a tyrant encircle us not.    In the fair Illinois the eagle's bold wing       Is stretched o'er a people determined and free,   And the shouts of her sons in melody ring       O'er her bower covered groves and fine prairie.    A NEW YEAR'S SONG.    This morning in silence I ponder and mourn,   O'er the scenes that have passed no more to return,   How vast are the labors, the troubles and fears,   Of eight hundred millions who've toiled through the year.    How many ten thousands were slain by their foes,   While widows and orphans have mourn'd o'er their woes,   While pestilence, famine and earthquakes appear,   And signs in the heavens throughout the past year.    How many been murder'd and plunder'd and robb'd,   How many oppressed and driven by mobs,   How oft have the heaven's bedewed with their tears   The earth o'er the scenes they beheld the past year.    But the day-star has dawn'd o'er the land of the bless'd,   The first beams of morning, the morning or rest;   When cleans'd from pollution the earth shall appear   As the garden of Eden, and peace crown the year.    Then welcome the new year, I hail with delight,   The season approaching with time's rapid flight;   While each fleeting moment brings near and more near,   The day, long expected, the great thousand years.    I praise and adore the eternal I Am;   Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb,   Who order the seasons that glide o'er the spheres,   And crown with such blessings, each happy new year.    A LAMENTATION.  ON TAKING LEAVE OF NEW-YORK.    Adieu to the city, where long I have wandered,       To tell them of judgments and warn them to flee;   How often in sorrow, their woes I have pondered:       Perhaps in affliction, they'll think upon me.    With a tear of compassion, in silence retiring,       The last ray of hope for your safety expiring;   A feeling of pity this bosom inspiring--       Sing this lamentation and think upon me.    How often at evening your halls have resounded       With th' pure testimony of Jesus, so free;   While the meek were rejoicing, the proud were confounded,       The poor had the gospel;--they'll think upon me.    When Empires shall tremble at Israel returning,       And earth shall be cleans'd by the Spirit of burning;   When proud men shall perish, and Priests with their learning,--       Sing this lamentation, and think upon me.    When the Union is severed, and liberty's blessings       Withheld from the sons of Columbia, once free;   When bloodshed and war, and famine d'stress them,       Remember the warning! and think upon me.    When this mighty city shall crumble to ruin,       And sink as a millstone, the merchants undoing;   The ransom'd, the highway of Zion pursuing,--       Sing this lamentation, and think upon me.    LAMENTATION BY P. P. PRATT.  IN MEMORY OP HIS DEPARTED WIFE, WHO DIED, MARCH 25, 1837.    The joys of home I once have tasted,       All its pleasures called my own;   Friendship's purest pleasures graced it,       But they're gone,--I'm left alone,    Now no more that smile of gladness       Welcomes me at my return;   But a lonely, solemn sadness:       Oh she's gone,--I'm left alone!    Oft when clouds of care and trouble,       Like a tempest o'er me roll'd,   A look, a word, an act of kindness,       Served to calm my troubled soul.    When by pain and sickness wasted,       Oft she lingered near my bed;   Fed me, nursed me as an angel,       Washed my feet or bathed my head.    When to western wilds I wandered,       Rear'd in solitude my cot;   Clear'd away the gloomy forest,--       She with flowers adorned the spot.    When by ruthless mobs was driven,       Wounded, bleeding, from my home,   Wandering in a land of strangers,       Pilgrim like she with me roamed.    When in distant climes I wander'd,       To bear glad tidings to mankind;   She shared my toils and travels gladly,       Or would consent to stay behind.    Returning from a distant journey,       She always met me with a smile;   Wash'd my feet and changed my raiment,       And bade me rest from all my toil.    But now alone I'm left to wander,       From land to land, from sea to sea;   And none except my only offspring       Will scarce inquire what comes of me.    And e'n to him I'll seem a stranger,       While he is reared by other hands;   He'll hardly feel I am his father,       When I return from distant lands.    What is it then for which I linger,       Still in this dark and dreary waste?   Where nothing centers my affection,       Where others' joys I cannot taste.    If I must still consent to tarry,       'Twill be to bear another's grief:   To save mankind from sin and sorrow,       And bring the broken heart relief.    To comfort those who mourn in Zion,       And bid ten thousand others come;   Where the widow, orphan, virgin,       And the poor may find a home.    FUNERAL HYMN.  ON THE DEATH OF MRS. PRATT.    Creation speaks with awful voice--       Hark! 'tis a universal groan   Re-echoes through the vast extent       Of worlds unnumbered called to mourn.    For sickness, sorrow, pain and death,       With awful tyranny have reigned;   While all eternity has shed       Her tears of sorrow o'er the slain.    But hark, again; a voice is heard,       Resounding through the sullen gloom;   A mighty conquerer has appear'd,       And rose triumphant from the tomb.    No longer let creation mourn;       Ye sons of sorrow, dry your tears;   Life--life--eternal life is ours,       Dismiss your doubts, dispel your fears.    The King shall soon in clouds descend,       With all the heav'nly hosts above;   The dead shall rise and hail"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60077"],["title","The Millennium, and Other Poems (#7)"],["body","friends,       And always dwell with those they love.    No tears, no sorrow, death or pain,       Shall e'er be known to enter there;   But perfect peace, immortal bloom,       Shall reign triumphant ev'ry where!    FAREWELL MEMORIAL.    Keep these few lines till time shall end,   In memory of your absent friend;   Who wanders o'er life's boisterous wave,   The meek, the humble poor to save.    While I endure I'll spend my breath   In prayer for those who love the truth.   In distant lands I'll call to mind,   My true and faithful friends so kind.    Let these few lines adorn the place   Where you retire to seek his grace;   Then lift your voice in humble prayer,   For him whose lines are hanging there.    THE PILGRIM.    On the shores of Ontario I'm now doom'd to wander.   A pilgrim in exile, a stranger I roam,   While the prince and the beggar, the wise and the simple,   In palace or cottage can each find a home.   The foxes have holes and the birds they have nests,   And all but a preacher has somewhere to rest.    GENERAL CONFERENCE, FAREWELL.    Farewell, ye servants of the Lord,   To whom we oft have preach'd the word;   May you improve the wisdom given,   And lead ten thousand souls to heaven.    Farewell, ye saints of latter days,   With whom we've met in prayer and praise,   In whose kind hearts the truth has shone,   By which we're gathered all in one.    Farewell kind friends, whose hearts are true   We can no longer stay with you;   Arise--the voice of truth obey,   O come and wash your sins away.    Farewell to all whose stubborn wills   Bind them in chains of darkness still:   Our voice no longer you shall hear,   Till Jesus shall in clouds appear:    Then you shall see, and hear, and know,   What you rejected here below.   Though you may sink in endless pain,   Yet _truth eternal will remain_.    THE DOWNFALL OF BABYLON    An angel of glory from heaven descended,   While his power and glory enlightened the earth;   With a voice strong and mighty, his cry was extended,   Babylon is fallen and hushed in her mirth;    The dwelling of devils and every foul spirit,   The cage of uncleanness and of hateful birds.   All nations had tasted her wine and were drunken,   But now she is fallen the angel brings word;    Her merchants were great men, and through her abundance,   They long had wax'd rich in her traffic though vain,   But now she is fallen,--is fallen,--is fallen,   Her riches and glory have ended in pain;    Her plagues in one day--death, mourning and famine,   And flame shall devour her and burn her withal;   The kings of the earth at the smoke of her burning,   Shall stand afar off and lament her sad fall.    Her merchants shall weep for their traffic is ended,   Their gold and their silver, their stones and their pearls,   Their linen and purple, their silk and their scarlet,   And all things that wealth could procure in the world.    Their vessels of ivory and brass, iron and marble,   And cinnamon and odours, frankincense and wine.   And oil and fine flour, wheat, beasts, sheep and horses,   And chariots and slaves, and the souls of mankind.    Rejoice, O thou Heaven! ye holy apostles,   And prophets for God hath avenged you withal,   For like a great millstone doth sink in the ocean,   E'en so on a sudden shall Babylon fall;    The voice of musicians, the harp and the pipers,   And trumpets and organs no longer shall sound,   No craftsmen, mechanic or workman whatever,   Within thy dominion shall ever be found;    No more shall the sound of a millstone be heard,   The light of a candle no more in thee shine,   The voice of the bridegroom and bride ever silent,   Darkness and sorrow, and death shall be thine.    PRATT'S DEFENCE  BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES OF MISSOURI.    As down in a lone dungeon with darkness o'er-spread,   In silence and sorrow I made my lone bed,       While far from my prison my friends had retired,       And joy from this bosom had almost expired.    From all that was lovely constrained for to part,   From wife and from children so dear to my heart;       While foes were exulting, and friends far away,       In half broken slumbers all pensive I lay.    I thought upon Zion--her sorrowful doom:--   I thought on her anguish--her trouble and gloom.       How for years she had wandered, a captive forlorn,       Cast out and afflicted, and treated with scorn.    I thought on the time when some five years ago,   Twelve hundred from Jackson were driven by foes,       While two hundred houses to ashes were burned;--       Our flourishing fields to a desert were turned.    I remembered these crimes still unpunished remained,   And the like oft repeated--again, and again,       From counties adjoining, compelled to remove,       We purchased in Caldwell, Prairie and Grove.    And there 'mid the wild flowers that bloomed o'e the plain,   Our rights and our freedom we thought to maintain:       Nor dreamed that oppression would drive us from thence,       The laws of our country we claimed for defence    But soon as kind autumn rewarded our toil,   And plenty around us began for to smile,       Our foes were assembled--being tempted with gain;       To ravage and plunder, and drive us again.    When many were driven, and plundered, and robb'd.   And some had been murdered by this dreadful mob,--       When cries for redress and protection were vain,       We arose in our strength our own rights to maintain.    The mob soon dispersed, to the Rulers appealed,   Saying, lend us your aid, and the Mormons will yield,       For surely they never were known to resist       A mob when commissioned by Rulers and Priests.    This soon was considered by far the best plan;   And orders were issued for ten thousand men,       Including the Wilsons, and Gillums, of course,       And all the mob forces, for better, for worse.    These soon were forthcoming, in dreadful array!   Some painted like Indians, all armed for the fray!       The Mormons soon yielded without the first fire,       And the mobers accomplished their utmost desire.    Some females were ravished--and cattle and grain   Became a free booty--and one pris'ner slain.       Some twenty or thirty were murdered outright,       And ten thousand others were BANISHED THE STATE!    By what LAW of the Statute to me is unknown;   But it must be by law all these great things were done;       For the next Legislature the expense to defray,       Voted two hundred thousand the soldiers to pay.    To resist THIS oppression--THESE excellent laws,   Was murder! and treason!! (in technical clause,)       So while women and children were driven away       Their husbands and fathers in prison must stay.    So now to the jury and judge I submit;   I'm not learned in _such_ laws,--they may hang or acquit--       But though they should hang me, or keep me in jail,       The spirit of Freedom and Truth will prevail.    PRATT'S DELIVERANCE.  \"The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed.\"  ISAIAH.    The chains are rent, the dungeon's gloom       No more these active limbs confine.   I rise as from the dreary tomb,       Where long in prison I repined.    I mount--I fly--I haste away,       Buoyed, as it were, on angel's wings;   O home! O friends! O liberty!--       O God of strength, thy praise I'll sing.    Hosanna now in highest strains,       Glory to God and to the Lamb,   Hosanna to the king who reigns       In heaven and earth--the great I Am.    VISIT TO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.  [Extract from the Author's Journal.]  When we came near the base of the mountain, two beautiful and transparent lakes, surrounded with a romantic forest of evergreen, and other trees, added greatly to the interest of the scene. Between these lakes a mansion was reared for the public entertainment of those whom curiosity draws to the place. This house furnished pleasure boats, fishing apparatus, guides, &c., for the accommodation of parties of pleasure, and others who wished to spend a few hours amid these romantic and picturesque scenes of sublimity and grandeur, where nature in her wildest freaks had combined the gentle and lovely, which seems to soothe and calm the spirits with the awfully grand, the terribly majestic, and the wild and romantic, as if calculated at once to interest the curious, to please the merry, to add gloom to solitude, and fervor to devotion; and in a word, to fill the contemplative mind with the highest degree of wonder and admiration. Our road led directly between the two small lakes, through what is called the notch. The mountains on each hand reared their majestic piles almost perpendicular for many hundred feet.    While clouds hung lowering on their bosoms,   And their tall summits high above   The misty vapors stood in awful pride,   And still serenely smiled amid clear skies,   And all the splendor of the morning sun.  When we had passed between the lakes and walked a short distance, we left the road and took a footpath to the left hand, and commenced our ascent up the steep sides of the mountain. Our path for many hundred feet was very steep, and in many places almost perpendicular; but the rough fragments of rock afforded steps; and these, together with twigs and shrubs which we seized with our hands, enabled us to climb with some degree of safety as well as speed. When we had arrived at the distance of perhaps half a mile, the scene was truly awful. Huge fragments of rock were thrown together in inconceivable confusion, as if by some terrible convulsion of nature; recalling to mind a time long since passed, when    Earth with a tremendous groan,   Did for a dying Jesus mourn.  Passing still onward on our airy way, the timber began to be of a different variety, suited to a colder climate, and fast diminishing in its size, until at length we were only surrounded with dwarf cedars, or spruce; and still higher up, even these ceased to vegetate, and a bleak, bald, and rocky summit still reared its dreary head a"]]]
