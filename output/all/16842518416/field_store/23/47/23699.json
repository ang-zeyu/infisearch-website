That leaves me all right. If you want to buy it back at any time you must apply to him.”  The man in the white hat stared at Walter as if he was a museum freak.  “Boy,” he said, in a tone of enforced admiration, “you're smart!”  “I am glad you think so, sir,” returned Walter. “You pay me a compliment.”  “How old are you?”  “Seventeen.”  “A seventeen-year-old boy who can get the better of Jim Beckwith is smart, and no mistake.”  “Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me whether it's true that the watch belongs to Mr. Beckwith, as he says?”  “I bought it of another man, who may have stolen it from him,” said he of the white hat, cautiously.  “Well, you'll have to settle with him. I'm out of it!”  While Walter was speaking, an extraordinary change came over the countenance of the man in the white hat. The color faded from his cheeks and he half rose from his seat. He was not looking at Walter, but beyond him, toward the door. Walter turned, following his look, and when he saw who had entered he understood the situation.     CHAPTER XI  THE MAN FROM DAKOTA   The man who had just entered the reading-room was no other than Detective Green.  He nodded pleasantly to Walter.  “So you have put up here,” he said. “Well, it is a good place. And is this gentleman a friend of yours?” indicating the man in the white hat.  “I bought the watch from him.”  “Ha! I thought so. I see you know me, Steve Ashton.”  “Yes, sir,” answered Ashton, nervously. “I hope you are well.”  “You are very kind. Then you really hope I am well?”  “Of course. Why shouldn't I?”  “Well, there are some of your companions, I hear, who are not so cordial--Jim Beckwith, for instance. By the way, you have some business arrangements with Jim Beckwith?”  “I know him, sir,” answered Astern, hesitatingly. “You know him well, I suspect. So you sold my young friend here a watch?”  “Yes, sir.”  “At a remarkable sacrifice?”  “Yes, sir. It was worth more than he paid for it.”  “And yet it seemed likely to be a losing bargain for him. It would have been--but for me.”  Ashton looked at Walter inquiringly. The latter smiled.  “You gave me credit for being smarter than I was,” said Walter. “Mr. Green, here, came to my assistance.”  “I think, Mr. Ashton,” said Detective Green, with suavity, “that you have a wife and family in Dakota?”  “I, sir--”  “Yes; and it was to obtain money to join them that you sold your watch on the train?”  “Yes, sir,” answered Ashton, faintly.  “I am going to give you a bit of advice. It will be wise for you to go to Dakota, as you planned. This is a wicked city--in spots--and I am afraid you have been keeping bad company. How long have you known Beckwith?”  “About six months.”  “And he drew you into this business?”  “Yes, sir.”  “I thought so. You are new to the profession. Still, I knew you. I make it a point to get acquainted with the new men. Is the watch honestly yours?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Get it back from Beckwith, and then drop his acquaintance. If necessary, leave Chicago. Have you a trade?”  “Yes, sir. I am a machinist.”  “It is a good trade. Go back to it. Is that advice friendly?”  “Yes, sir,” answered Ashton, with more confidence. “I didn't expect to get friendly advice from Detective Green.”  “Perhaps not. You didn't know me, that was all. You looked upon me as an enemy, I suppose?”  “Yes, sir.”  “I am an enemy to those who are incurably bad. I think you were meant for an honest man.”  “So I was, sir. I should be still if I hadn't met with Jim Beckwith.”  “Have done with him, then. If you follow my advice you need not fear meeting with me again.”  The detective went up to the desk, bought a cigar and then left the room, with a nod to Ashton and Walter.  “Will you follow his advice?” asked Walter.  “Yes, I will. Hereafter I will depend upon honest work for an honest livelihood. What is your name?”  “Walter Sherwood.”  “Then, Walter Sherwood, I am glad I did not succeed in robbing you. Yet I am glad I met you. It will lead to my reformation. Will you give me your hand?”  “Willingly.”  Steve Ashton shook the proffered hand energetically.  “If I can do you a favor at any time I shall be glad to do so.”  “Perhaps you can. I cannot afford to live at a hotel. Can you recommend me to some respectable but modest-priced boarding-house?”  “Yes. The widow of a machinist who used to be employed in the same shop as myself keeps a few boarders. I think she would take you for six dollars a week, or five if you have a friend to room with you.”  “Can you show me the place after supper--that is, unless you are in a hurry to start for Dakota?” He added, with a smile.  “I never was in Dakota in my life,” said Ashton. “I told you a lie.”  “I was beginning to think so.”  “But I shall drop all that. From this time on you can trust me.”  After supper Walter went round with Ashton to a house in Harrison Street--the boarding-house referred to. The door was opened by a careworn woman of middle age.  “How do you do, Mr. Ashton?” she said, with an inquiring look.  “Very well, thank you, Mrs. Canfield. Have you any rooms vacant?”  “Are you asking for yourself?”  “No, for my young friend here, Mr. Sherwood.”  “Do you want a large room or a small one?” asked Mrs. Canfield, brightening up a little.  “That depends a little on the price,” answered Walter.  “I can give you a hall bedroom and board for five dollars and a half a week.”  “Can you show me the room?”  “Be kind enough to follow me.”  Walter followed the landlady up a narrow staircase, or rather two of them, and was shown a hall bedroom, which seemed to be uncomfortably full, though it only contained a bedstead, a chair, a very small bureau and a washstand. There was scarcely room for him to stand unless he stood on the bed. It was indeed vastly different from his nice college room and from his comfortable chamber at home.  “I should like to see a larger room,” said Walter, not venturing to make any comment on the hall room.  He was shown an adjoining apartment, about ten feet by twelve. It was small, but decidedly preferable to the other.  “How much do you charge for this room, Mrs. Canfield?”  “I shall have to charge you six dollars if you occupy it alone, but if you can get another young gentleman to occupy it with you I will say ten dollars for the two.”  “I will take it alone at first. Can I move in tomorrow morning?”  “I will have it ready for you by eleven o'clock.”  “That will do.”  “How do you like it?” asked Ashton, when they were in the street.  “I think I can make it do.”  “I suppose you have been used to something better?”  “Yes.”  “I can direct you to a better house.”  “Thank you, but six dollars a week is all I can afford at present. I have no income, but I shall look for a place at once.”  “You haven't any trade, have you?”  “No,” answered Walter, with a smile. Brought up as he had been, it seemed odd to be asked if he had a trade.  “Some trades pay very well. I have a nephew who is a bricklayer. He gets from three to four dollars a day.”  “I am afraid I should not like that business. Besides, it would take a good while to learn it.”  Walter smiled to himself as he pictured some of his aristocratic college friends seeing him laying bricks. He was not a snob, nor would he have disdained to notice a friend or school companion filling such a position, but he felt that Providence must have something in store for him more congenial, though perhaps less lucrative.  “I have a cousin who is a carpenter,” proceeded Ashton. “He makes two dollars and a half a day, and supports a wife and three children in comfort.”  “I wonder if I could support a family on fifteen dollars a week?”  thought Walter. “Fortunately, I have only to support myself. I ought to be able to do that in a large city like Chicago.”  Reared in comfort, Walter knew very little of the competition and struggles of workingmen, and had an idea that he would be able easily to command a salary of ten dollars a week, though he was wholly disqualified for any special line of business. This he set down as the minimum. Paying six dollars a week for board, he calculated that he could get along on this salary with extreme economy. Fortunately, he was pretty well provided with clothing, or would be when he had sent for his trunk, and would not find it necessary for some time to come to purchase anything, except probably a pair of shoes, a necktie, or some trifle. Then probably his pay would soon be raised, and this would make him comfortable.  That evening Walter went to Hooley's Theater and occupied a dollar seat. It was hardly prudent, but he had seventy dollars still, and that seemed to him a large sum. He enjoyed the play, and got a sound night's rest after it.  The next morning he settled his hotel bill, took his gripsack in his hand, and walked over to his new boarding-house.     CHAPTER XII  IN SEARCH OF EMPLOYMENT   “Wanted--A young man of seventeen or eighteen in an insurance office, No. 169 La Salle Street.”  This notice attracted the attention of Walter as he ran his eyes over the advertising columns of the Chicago _Times_ on the second day after his arrival in the city.  “I think that will suit me,” he said to himself. “It is a nice, respectable business, and I think I should like it. I will go to the office and make inquiries.”  He entered a large building, devoted to offices, and ascended to the third story, where he found the office of Perkins & Windermere, the names given in the advertisement. A young man of about his own age was coming out of the office as he entered--an unsuccessful applicant, Walter inferred.  Opening the door, he saw a man of about forty seated in a revolving chair at a desk.  “I believe you advertised for an assistant,” began Walter, as the occupant of the chair turned round.  “Yes,” replied Mr. Perkins--for it was he--eying Walter with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],["title","Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

CHAPTER I  OUR FRIENDLY NERVES   \"Hop up, Dick, love! See how glorious the sun is on the new snow. Now isn't that more beautiful than your dreams? And see the birdies! They can't find any breakfast. Let's hurry and have our morning wrestle and dress and give them some breakie before Anne calls.\"  The mother is Ethel Baxter Lord. She is thirty-eight, and Dick-boy is just five. The mother's face is striking, striking as an example of fine chiseling of features, each line standing for sensitiveness, and each change revealing refinement of thought. The eyes and hair are richly brown. Slender, graceful, perennially neat, she represents the mother beautiful, the wife inspiring, the friend beloved. Happily as we have seen her start a new day for Dick, did she always add some cheer, some fineness of touch, some joy of word, some stimulating helpfulness to every greeting, to every occasion.  The home was not pretentious. Thoroughly cozy, with many artistic touches within, it snuggled on the heights near Arlington, the close neighbor to many of the Nation's best memories, looking out on a noble sweep of the fine, old Potomac, with glimpses through the trees of the Nation's Capitol, glimpses revealing the best of its beauties. It was a home from which emanated an atmosphere of peace and repose which one seemed to feel even as one approached. It was a home pervaded with the breath of happiness, a home which none entered without benefit.  The husband, Martin Lord, was an expert chemist who had long been in the service of the Government. Capable, worthy, manly, he was blest in what he was, and in what he had. They had been married eight years, and the slipping away of the first child, Margaret, was the only sadness which had paused at their door. Mrs. Lord had been Ethel Baxter for thirty years. Her father was an intense, high-strung business man, an importer, who spent much time in Europe where he died of an American-contracted typhoid-fever, when Ethel was ten. Her mother was one of a large well-known Maryland family, fair, brown-eyed too, and frail; also, by all the rights of inheritance, training and development, sensitive and nervous. In her family the precedents of blue blood were religiously maintained with so much emphasis on the \"blue\" that no beginning was ever made in training her into a protective robustness. So, in spite of elaborate preparation and noted New York skill and the highest grade of conscientious nursing, she recovered poorly after Ethel's birth. Strength, even such as she formerly had, did not return. She didn't want to be an invalid. She was devoted to her husband and eager to companion and mother her child. The surgeons thought her recovery lay in their skill, and in ten years one operated twice, and two others operated once each, but for some reason the scalpel's edge did not reach the weakness. Then Mr. Baxter died, and all of her physical discomforts seemed intensified until, in desperation, the fifth operation was undertaken, which was long and severe, and from which she failed to react. So Ethel was an orphan at eleven, though not alone, for the good uncle, her mother's brother, took her to his home and never failed to respond to any impulse through which he felt he could fulfil the fatherhood and motherhood which he had assumed. Absolutely devoted, affectionate, emotional, he planned impulsively, he gave freely, but he knew not law nor order in his own high-keyed life; so neither law nor order entered into the training of his ward.  Ethel Baxter's childhood had been remarkably well influenced, considering the nervous intensity of both parents. For the mother's sake, their winters had been spent in Florida, their summers on Long Island. Her mother, in face of the fact that she rarely knew a day of physical comfort and for years had not felt the thrill of physical strength, most conscientiously gave time, thought and prayer to her child's rearing. Hours were devoted to daily lessons, and many habits of consideration and refinement, many ideals of beauty, many niceties of domestic duty and practically all her studies, were mother-taught. Ethel was active, physically restless, impulsive, cheerful, fairly intense in her eagerness for an expression of the thrilling activities within. She was truly a high-type product of generations of fine living, and her blue blood did show from the first in the rapid development of keenness of mind and acuteness of feeling. Typically of the nervous temperament, she early showed a superb capacity for complex adjustments. Yet, with one damaging, and later threatening idea, the mother infected the child's mind; the conception of invalidism entered into the constructive fabric of the child-thought all the more deeply, because there was little of offensively selfish invalidism ever displayed by the mother. But many of the concessions and considerations instinctively demanded by the nervous sufferer were for years matters-of-course in the Baxter home; and these demands, almost unconsciously made by the mother, could but modify much of the natural expression of her child's young years.  Another damaging attitude-reaction, intense in its expression, followed the unexpected death of Ethel's father. The mother, true to the ancient and honorable precedents of her family, went into a month of helplessness following the sad news. She could not attend the funeral, and for weeks the activities of the household were muffled by mourning; when she left her room, it was to wear the deepest crepe, while a half-inch of deadest black bordered the hundreds of responses which she personally sent to notes of condolence. She never spoke again of her husband without reference to her bereavement. Then, a year later, when the mother herself suddenly went, it seemed to devolve on the child to fulfil the mother's teachings. Her uncle's attitude, moreover, toward his sister's death was in many ways unhappy, for he did not repress expressions of bitterness toward the surgeons and condemned the fate which had so early robbed Ethel of both parents.  Thus, early and intensely, a morbid attitude toward death, a conviction that self-pity was reasonable, normal, wholesome, a belief that it was her duty to publicly display intensive evidences of her affliction, determined a lasting and potent influence in this girl's life which was to alloy her young womanhood--disturbing factors, all, which before twelve caused much emotional disequilibrium. She now lived with her uncle in New York City and her summers were spent in Canada. The sense of fitness was so strong that during the next two vitally important, developing years she avoided any physical expression of her natural exuberance of spirits; and habits now formed which were, for years, to deny her any right use of her muscular self. She read much; she read well; she read intensely. She attended a private school and long before her time was an accredited young lady. Mentally, she matured very early, and with the exception of the damaging influences which have been mentioned, she represented a superior capacity for feeling and conceiving and accomplishing, even as she possessed an equally keen capacity for suffering.  She was most winsome at sixteen, a bit frail and fragile, often spoken of as a rare piece of Sevres, beloved with a tenderness which would have warped the disposition of one less unselfish; emotionally intense, brilliancy and vivacity periodically burst through the habit of her reserve. A perfect pupil, and in all fine things literary, keenly alive, she had"]]]
