I am grieved we asked, or your Governor-General granted, a right to us to land on these shores and make our fish. Lord Elgin ought to have known that every foot of the sea-coast of Nova Scotia has been granted, and is now private property.  “To concede a privilege to land, with a proviso to respect the rights of the owner, is nonsense. This comes of not sending a man to negociate who is chosen by the people, not for his rank, but for his ability and knowledge. The fact is, I take blame to myself about it, for I was pumped who would do best and be most acceptable to us Americans. I was afeared they would send a Billingsgate contractor, who is a plaguy sight more posted up about fisheries than any member of parliament, or a clever colonist (not a party man), and they know more than both the others put together; and I dreaded if they sent either, there would be a _quid pro quo,_ as Josiah says, to be given, afore we got the fisheries, if we ever got them, at all. ‘So,’ sais I, out of a bit of fun, for I can’t help taken a rise out of folks no how I can fix it, ‘send us a lord. We are mighty fond of noblemen to Washington, and toady them first-rate. It will please such a man as Pierce to show him so much respect as to send a peer to him. He will get whatever he asks.’  “Well, they fell into the trap beautiful. They sent us one, and we rowed him up to the very head waters of Salt River in no time.1 But I am sorry we asked the privilege to land and cure fish. I didn’t think any created critter would have granted that. Yes, I foresee trouble arising out of this. Suppose ‘Cayenne Pepper,’ as we call the captain that commanded the ‘Cayenne’ at Grey Town, was to come to a port in Nova Scotia, and pepper it for insultin’ our flag by apprehenden trespassers (though how a constable is to arrest a crew of twenty men unless, Irishman like, he surrounds them, is a mystery to me). What would be done in that case? Neither you nor I can tell, Squire. But depend upon it, there is a tempestical time comin’, and it is as well to be on the safe side of the fence when there is a chance of kicking going on.  1 To row up Salt River is a common phrase, used generally to denote political defeat. The distance to which a party is rowed up Salt River depends entirely upon the magnitude of the majority against him. If the defeat is overwhelming, the unsuccessful party is said “to be rowed up to the very head waters of Salt River.” The phrase has its origin in the fact that there is a small stream of that name in Kentucky, the passage of which is made difficult and laborious, as well by its tortuous course as by numerous shallows and bars. The real application of the phrase is to the unhappy wight who propels the boat, but politically, in slang usage, it means the man rowed up, the passenger—I. INMAN.   “The bombardment of Grey Town was the greatest and bravest exploit of modern times. We silenced their guns at the first broadside, and shut them up so sudden that envious folks like the British now swear they had none, while we lost only one man in the engagement, but he was drunk and fell overboard. What is the cannonade of Sebastopool to that? Why it sinks into insignificance.”  He had hardly ceased speaking, when the wheels of a carriage were heard rapidly approaching the door. Taking out his watch, and observing the hour, he said: “Squire, it is now eleven o’clock. I must be a movin’. Good bye! I am off to Halifax. I am goin’ to make a night flight of it. The wind is fair, and I must sail by daylight to-morrow morning. Farewell!”  He then shook hands most cordially with me, and said: “Squire, unless you feel inclined at some future day to make the tour of the States with me, or somethin’ turns up I am not availed of, I am afraid you have seen the last Journal of your old friend ‘Sam Slick.’”     CHAPTER II. CLIPPERS AND STEAMERS.   Whoever has taken the trouble to read the “Wise Saws” of Mr Slick, will be prepared to resume the thread of his narrative without explanation, if indeed these unconnected selections deserve the appellation. But as this work may fall into the hands of many people who never saw its predecessor, it may be necessary to premise that our old friend Sam, having received a commission from the President of the United States, to visit the coast of Nova Scotia, and report to him fully on the state of the fisheries, their extent and value, the manner in which they were prosecuted, and the best mode of obtaining a participation in them, he proceeded on his cruise in a trading vessel, called the “Black Hawk,” whereof Timothy Cutler was master, and Mr Eldad Nickerson the pilot. The two preceding volumes contained his adventures at sea, and in the harbours of the province, to the westward of Halifax. The present work is devoted to his remarks on “nature and human nature.”  While amusing himself fishing within three miles of the coast, off La Haive, in contravention of the treaty, he narrowly escaped capture by the British cruiser “Spitfire,” commanded by Captain Stoker. By a skilful manoeuvre, he decoyed the man-of-war, in the eagerness of the chase, on to a sand-bar, when he dexterously slipt through a narrow passage between two islands, and keeping one of them in a line between the “Black Hawk” and her pursuer, so as to be out of the reach of her guns, he steered for the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, and was soon out of sight of the islands behind which his enemy lay embedded in the sand; from this point the narrative is resumed in Mr Slick’s own words.1  1 His remarks on the fisheries I have wholly omitted, for they have now lost their interest. His observations on “nature and human nature” are alone retained, as they may be said to have a universal application.—ED.   “I guess,” said I, “Captain, the ‘Spitfire’ will have to put into Halifax to report herself and be surveyed, so we may pursue our course in peace. But this ‘Black Hawk’ is a doll, ain’t she? don’t she skim over the water like a sea gull? The truth is, Cutler, when you ain’t in a hurry, and want to enjoy yourself at sea, as I always do, for I am a grand sailor, give me a clipper. She is so light and buoyant, and the motion so elastic, it actilly exilerates your spirits. There is something like life in her gait, and you have her in hand like a horse, and you feel as if you were her master, and directed her movements. I ain’t sure you don’t seem as if you were part of her yourself. Then there is room to show skill and seamanship, and if you don’t in reality go as quick as a steamer, you seem to go faster, if there is no visible object to measure your speed by, and that is something, for the white foam on the leeward side rushes by you in rips, raps, and rainbows like Canadian rapids.  “Then if she is an atrysilly1 like this, and she is doing her prettiest, and actilly laughs again, she is so pleased, why you are satisfied, for you don’t make the breeze, you take it as you find it, like all other good gifts of Providence, and say, ‘ain’t she going like wink, how she forges ahead, don’t she?’ Your attention is kept alive, too, watchin’ the wind, and trimmin’ sail to it accordingly, and the jolly ‘Oh, heave oh,’ of the sailors is music one loves to listen to, and if you wish to take a stretch for it in your cloak on deck, on the sunny or shady side of the companion-way, the breeze whistles a nice soft lullaby for you, and you are off in the land of Nod in no time.”  1 The Atricilla, or laughing sea-gull. Its note resembles a coarse laugh. Hence its name. It is very common in the Bahamas.   “Dreaming of Sophy Collingwood,” sais the Captain, “and the witch of Eskisooney, eh?”  “Yes, dreamin’ of bright eyes and smilin’ faces, or anythin’ else that’s near and dear, for to my idea, the heart gives the subject for the head to think upon. In a fair wind and a charmin’ day like this, I never coiled up on the deck for a nap in my life, that I had’nt pleasant dreams. You feel as if you were at peace with all the world in general, and yourself in partikeler, and that it is very polite of folks to stay to home ashore, and let you and your friends enjoy yourselves without treadin’ on your toes, and wakin’ of you up if asleep, or a jostlin’ of you in your turn on the quarter-deck, or over-hearin’ of your conversation.  “And ain’t you always ready for your meals, and don’t you walk into them in rael right down earnest? Oh, nothing ever tastes so good to me as it does at sea. The appetite, like a sharp knife, makes the meat seem tender, and the sea air is a great friend of digestion, and always keeps company with it. Then you don’t care to sit and drink after dinner as you do at an hotel of an idle day, for you want to go on deck, light your cigar, take a sweep round the horizon with your glass to see if there is any sail in sight, glance at the sky to ascertain if the breeze is likely to hold, and then bring yourself to anchor on a seat, and have a dish of chat for a dessert with the captain, if he is a man of books like you, Cutler, or a man of reefs, rocks, and sandbars, fish, cordwood, and smugglin’, or collisions, wracks, and salvage, like the pilot.  “Then, if you have a decent sample or two of passengers on board, you can discuss men and things, and women and nothings, law, physick, and divinity, or that endless, tangled ball of yarn, politicks, or you can swap anecdotes, and make your fortune in the trade. And by the same trail of thought we must give one or two of these Blue-Noses now and then a cast on board with us to draw them out. “Well, if you want to read, you can go and turn in and take a book, and solitudinise to it, and there is no one to disturb you.

I got enough for common use. It warn’t all pure gold; but it was kind of small change, and answered every purpose of trade or travel. Oh, it’s no use a talkin’; where time ain’t the main object, there’s nothin’ like a sailin’ vessel to a man who ain’t sea-sick, and such fellows ought to be cloriformed, put to bed, and left there till the voyage is over. They have no business to go to sea, if they are such fools as not to know how to enjoy themselves.  “Then sailors are characters; they are men of the world, there is great self-reliance in them. They have to fight their way in life through many trials and difficulties, and their trust is in God and their own strong arm. They are so much in their own element, they seem as if they were born on the sea, cradled on its billows, and, like Mother Carey’s chickens, delighted in its storms and mountain waves. They walk, talk, and dress differently from landsmen. They straddle as they pace the deck, so as to brace the body and keep their trowsers up at the same time; their gait is loose, and their dress loose, and their limbs loose; indeed, they are rather too fond _of slack._ They climb like monkeys, and depend more on their paws than their legs. They tumble up, but never down. They count, not by fingers, it is tedious, but by hands; they put a part for the whole, and call themselves hands, for they are paid for the use of them, and not their heads.  “Though they are two-handed they are not close-fisted fellows. They despise science, but are fond of practical knowledge. When the sun is over the foreyard, they know the time of day as well as the captain, and call for their grog, and when they lay back their heads, and turn up the bottom of the mug to the sky, they call it in derision taking an observation. But though they have many characteristics in common, there is an individuality in each that distinguishes him from the rest. He stands out in bold relief—I by myself, I. He feels and appreciates his importance. He knows no plural. The word ‘our’ belongs to landsmen; ‘my’ is the sailor’s phrase—my ship, my captain, my messmate, my watch on deck, ‘my eyes!’ ‘you lubber, don’t you know that’s _me?’_ I like to listen to their yarns and their jokes, and to hear them sing their simple ditties. The odd mixture of manliness and childishness—of boldness and superstitious fears; of preposterous claims for wages and thoughtless extravagance; of obedience and discontent—all goes to make the queer compound called ‘Jack.’ How often have I laughed over the fun of the forecastle in these small fore and aft packets of ourn! and I think I would back that place for wit against any bar-room in New York or New Orleans, and I believe they take the rag off of all creation.  “But the cook is my favourite. He is a scientific man, and so skilful in compounds, he generally goes by the name of doctor. I like the daily consultation with him about dinner: not that I am an epicure; but at sea, as the business of life is eating, it is as well to be master of one’s calling. Indeed, it appears to be a law of nature, that those who have mouths should understand what to put in them. It gratifies the doctor to confer with him, and who does it not please to be considered a man of importance? He is therefore a member of the Privy Council, and a more useful member he is too than many Right Honourables I know of—who have more acres than ideas. The Board assembles after breakfast, and a new dish is a great item in the budget. It keeps people in good humour the rest of the day, and affords topics for the table. To eat to support existence is only fit for criminals. Bread and water will do that; but to support and gratify nature at the same time is a noble effort of art, and well deserves the thanks of mankind. The cook too enlivens the consultation by telling marvellous stories about strange dishes he has seen. He has eaten serpents with the Siamese, monkeys in the West Indies, crocodiles and sloths in South America, and cats, rats, and dogs with the Chinese; and of course, as nobody can contradict him, says they are delicious. Like a salmon, you must give him the line, even if it wearies you, before you bag him; but when you do bring him to land his dishes are savoury. They have a relish that is peculiar to the sea, for _where there is no garden, vegetables are always most prized._ The glorious onion is duly valued, for as there is no mistress to be kissed, who will dare to object to its aroma?  “Then I like a Sunday at sea in a vessel like this, and a day like this, when the men are all clean and tidy, and the bell rings for prayers, and all hands are assembled aft to listen to the captain as he reads the Church Service. It seems like a family scene. It reminds me of dear old Minister and days gone by, when he used to call us round him, and repeated to us the promise ‘that when two or three were gathered together in God’s name, he would grant their request.’ The only difference is, sailors are more attentive and devout than landsmen. They seem more conscious that they are in the Divine presence. They have little to look upon but the heavens above and the boundless ocean around them. Both seem made on purpose for _them—_the sun to guide them by day, and the stars by night, the sea to bear them on its bosom, and the breeze to waft them on their course. They feel how powerless they are of themselves; how frail their bark; how dependent they are on the goodness and mercy of their Creator, and that it is He alone who can rule the tempest and control the stormy deep. Their impressions are few, but they are strong. It is the world that hardens the heart, and the ocean seems apart from it.  “They are noble fellows, sailors, and I love them; but, Cutler, how are they used, especially where they ought to be treated best, on board of men-of-war? The moment a ship arrives in port, the anchor cast and the sails furled—what dees the captain do? the popular captain too, the idol of the men; he who is so kind and so fond of them? Why, he calls them aft, and says, ‘Here, my lads, here is lots of cash for you, now be off ashore and enjoy yourselves.’ And they give three cheers for their noble commander—their good-hearted officer—the sailor’s friend—the jolly old blue jacket,—and they bundle into the boats, and on to the beach, like school-boys. And where do they go? Well, we won’t follow them, for I never was in them places where they _do_ go, and so I can’t describe them, and one thing I must say, I never yet found any place answer the picture drawn of it. But if half only of the accounts are true that I have heerd of them, they must be the devil’s own seminaries of vice—that’s a fact. Every mite and morsel as bad as the barrack scenes that we read of lately.  “Well, at the end of a week back come the sailors. They have had a glorious lark and enjoyed themselves beyond anything in the world, for they are pale, sick, sleepy, tired out, cleaned out, and kicked out, with black eyes, broken heads, swelled cheeks, minus a few teeth, half their clothes, and all their money.  “‘What,’ says the captain, ‘what’s the matter with you, Tom Marlin, that you limp so like a lame duck?’  “‘Nothing, your honour,’ says Tom, twitching his forelock, and making a scrape with his hind leg, ‘nothing, your honour, but a scratch from a bagganet.’  “‘What! a fight with the soldiers, eh? The cowardly rascals to use their side arms!’  “‘We cleared the house of them, Sir, in no time.’  “‘That’s right. Now go below, my lads, and turn in and get a good sleep. I like to see my _lambs_ enjoy themselves. It does my heart good.’  “And yet, Cutler, that man is said to be a father to his crew.”  “Slick,” said Cutler, “what a pity it is you wouldn’t always talk that way!” Now if there is any created thing that makes me mad, it is to have a feller look admiren at me, when I utter a piece of plain common sense like that, and turn up the whites of his eyes like a duck in thunder, as much as to say, what a pity it is you weren’t broughten up a preacher. It ryles me considerable, I tell you.  “Cutler,” said I, “did you ever see a colt in a pasture, how he would race and chase round the field, head, ears, and tail up, and stop short, snort as if he had seen the ghost of a bridle, and off again hot foot?”  “Yes,” said he, “I have, but you are not a colt, nor a boy either.”  “Well, did you ever see a horse when unharnessed from a little, light waggon, and turned out to grass, do nearly the same identical thing, and kick up his heels like mad, as much as to say, I am a free nigger now?”  “Well, I have,” said he.  “Stop,” said I, a touchin’ of him on his arm; “what in the world is that?” and I pointed over the taffrail to the weather-bow.  “Porpoises,” said he.  “What are they a doin’ of?”  “Sportin’ of themselves.”  “Exactly,” sais I, “and do you place man below the beasts of the field and the fishes of the sea? What in natur’ was humour given to us for but for our divarsion? What sort of a world would this be if every fellow spoke sermons and talked homilies, and what in that case would parsons do? I leave you to cypher that out, and then prove it by algebra; but I’ll tell you what they wouldn’t do, I’ll be hanged if they’d strike for higher wages, for fear they should not get any at all.”  “I knock under,” said he; “you may take my hat; now go on and finish the comparison between Clippers and Steamers.”  “Well,” sais I, “as I was a sayin’, Captain, give me a craft like this, that spreads its wings like a bird, and looks as if it was born, not made, a whole-sail breeze, and a seaman every inch of him like you on the deck, who looks you in the face, in a way as if he’d like to say, only bragging ain’t genteel, Ain’t she a clipper now, and ain’t I the man to handle her? Now this ain’t the case in a steamer. They ain’t vessels, they are more like floating factories; you see the steam machines and the enormous fires, and the clouds of smoke, but you don’t visit the"]]]
