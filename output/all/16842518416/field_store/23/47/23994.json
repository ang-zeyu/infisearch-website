And now, my friends, please to excuse       My lisping and my stammers;       I, for this once, have done my best,       And so--I'll make my manners.  The little boy's name was Edward Everett. He grew up to become a famous man and one of our greatest orators.     WRITING A COMPOSITION    \"Children, to-morrow I shall expect all of you to write compositions,\" said the teacher of Love Lane School. \"Then, on Friday those who have done the best may stand up and read their compositions to the school.\"  Some of the children were pleased, and some were not.  \"What shall we write about?\" they asked.  \"You may choose any subject that you like best,\" said the teacher.  Some of them thought that \"Home\" was a good subject. Others liked \"School.\" One little boy chose \"The Horse.\" A little girl said she would write about \"Summer.\"  The next day, every pupil except one had written a composition.  \"Henry Longfellow,\" said the teacher, \"why have you not written?\"  \"Because I don't know how,\" answered Henry. He was only a child.  \"Well,\" said the teacher, \"you can write words, can you not?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the boy.  \"After you have written three or four words, you can put them together, can you not?\"  \"Yes, sir; I think so.\"  \"Well, then,\" said the teacher, \"you may take your slate and go out behind the schoolhouse for half an hour. Think of something to write about, and write the word on your slate. Then try to tell what it is, what it is like, what it is good for, and what is done with it. That is the way to write a composition.\"  Henry took his slate and went out. Just behind the schoolhouse was Mr. Finney's barn. Quite close to the barn was a garden. And in the garden, Henry saw a turnip.  \"Well, I know what that is,\" he said to himself; and he wrote the word _turnip_ on his slate. Then he tried to tell what it was like, what it was good for, and what was done with it.  Before the half hour was ended he had written a very neat composition on his slate. He then went into the house, and waited while the teacher read it.  The teacher was surprised and pleased. He said, \"Henry Longfellow, you have done very well. Today you may stand up before the school and read what you have written about the turnip.\"  Many years after that, some funny little verses about Mr. Finney's turnip were printed in a newspaper. Some people said that they were what Henry Longfellow wrote on his slate that day at school.  But this was not true. Henry's composition was not in verse. As soon as it was read to the school, he rubbed it off the slate, and it was forgotten. Perhaps you would like to read those funny verses. Here they are; but you must never, _never_, NEVER think that Henry Longfellow wrote them.        Mr. Finney had a turnip,       And it grew, and it grew;       It grew behind the barn,       And the turnip did no harm.        And it grew, and it grew,       Till it could grow no taller;       Then Mr. Finney took it up,       And put it in the cellar.        There it lay, there it lay,       Till it began to rot;       Then Susie Finney washed it       And put it in a pot.        She boiled it, and boiled it,       As long as she was able;       Then Mrs. Finney took it,       And put it on the table.        Mr. Finney and his wife       Both sat down to sup;       And they ate, and they ate,       They ate the turnip up.   All the school children in our country have heard of Henry W. Longfellow. He was the best loved of all our poets. He wrote \"The Village Blacksmith,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" and many other beautiful pieces which you will like to read and remember.     THE WHISTLE    Two hundred years ago there lived in Boston a little boy whose name was Benjamin Franklin.  On the day that he was seven years old, his mother gave him a few pennies.  He looked at the bright, yellow pieces and said, \"What shall I do with these coppers, mother?\"  It was the first money that he had ever had.  \"You may buy something, if you wish,\" said his mother.  \"And then will you give me more?\" he asked.  His mother shook her head and said: \"No, Benjamin. I cannot give you any more. So you must be careful not to spend these foolishly.\"  The little fellow ran into the street. He heard the pennies jingle in his pocket. How rich he was!  Boston is now a great city, but at that time it was only a little town. There were not many stores.  As Benjamin ran down the street, he wondered what he should buy. Should he buy candy? He hardly knew how it tasted. Should he buy a pretty toy? If he had been the only child in the family, things might have been different. But there were fourteen boys and girls older than he, and two little sisters who were younger.  What a big family it was! And the father was a poor man. No wonder the lad had never owned a toy.  He had not gone far when he met a larger boy, who was blowing a whistle.  \"I wish I had that whistle,\" he said.  The big boy looked at him and blew it again. Oh, what a pretty sound it made!  \"I have some pennies,\" said Benjamin. He held them in his hand, and showed them to the boy. \"You may have them, if you will give me the whistle.\" \"All of them?\"  \"Yes, all of them.\"  \"Well, it's a bargain,\" said the boy; and he gave the whistle to Benjamin, and took the pennies.  Little Benjamin Franklin was very happy; for he was only seven years old. He ran home as fast as he could, blowing the whistle as he ran.  \"See, mother,\" he said, \"I have bought a whistle.\"  \"How much did you pay for it?\"  \"All the pennies you gave me.\"  \"Oh, Benjamin!\"  One of his brothers asked to see the whistle.  \"Well, well!\" he said. \"You've paid a dear price for this thing. It's only a penny whistle, and a poor one at that.\"  \"You might have bought half a dozen such whistles with the money I gave you,\" said his mother.  The little boy saw what a mistake he had made. The whistle did not please him any more. He threw it upon the floor and began to cry.  \"Never mind, my child,\" said his mother, very kindly. \"You are only a very little boy, and you will learn a great deal as you grow bigger. The lesson you have learned to-day is never to pay too dear for a whistle.\" Benjamin Franklin lived to be a very old man, but he never forgot that lesson.  Every boy and girl should remember the name of Benjamin Franklin. He was a great thinker and a great doer, and with Washington he helped to make our country free. His life was such that no man could ever say, \"Ben Franklin has wronged me.\"     THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD  I    In Scotland there once lived a poor shepherd whose name was James Hogg. His father and grandfather and great-grandfather had all been shepherds.  It was his business to take care of the sheep which belonged to a rich landholder by the Ettrick Water. Sometimes he had several hundreds of lambs to look after. He drove these to the pastures on the hills and watched them day after day while they fed on the short green grass.  He had a dog which he called Sirrah. This dog helped him watch the sheep. He would drive them from place to place as his master wished. Sometimes he would take care of the whole flock while the shepherd was resting or eating his dinner.  One dark night James Hogg was on the hilltop with a flock of seven hundred lambs. Sirrah was with him. Suddenly a storm came up. There was thunder and lightning; the wind blew hard; the rain poured.  The poor lambs were frightened. The shepherd and his dog could not keep them together. Some of them ran towards the east, some towards the west, and some towards the south.  The shepherd soon lost sight of them in the darkness. With his lighted lantern in his hand, he went up and down the rough hills calling for his lambs.  Two or three other shepherds joined him in the search. All night long they sought for the lambs.  Morning came and still they sought. They looked, as they thought, in every place where the lambs might have taken shelter.  At last James Hogg said, \"It's of no use; all we can do is to go home and tell the master that we have lost his whole flock.\"  They had walked a mile or two towards home, when they came to the edge of a narrow and deep ravine. They looked down, and at the bottom they saw some lambs huddled together among the rocks. And there was Sirrah standing guard over them and looking all around for help \"These must be the lambs that rushed off towards the south,\" said James Hogg.  [Illustration]  The men hurried down and soon saw that the flock was a large one.  \"I really believe they are all here,\" said one.  They counted them and were surprised to find that not one lamb of the great flock of seven hundred was missing.  How had Sirrah managed to get the three scattered divisions together? How had he managed to drive all the frightened little animals into this place of safety?  Nobody could answer these questions. But there was no shepherd in Scotland that could have done better than Sirrah did that night.  Long afterward James Hogg said, \"I never felt so grateful to any creature below the sun as I did to Sirrah that morning.\"    II   When James Hogg was a boy, his parents were too poor to send him to school. By some means, however, he learned to read; and after that he loved nothing so much as a good book.  There were no libraries near him, and it was hard for him to get books. But he was anxious to learn. Whenever he could buy or borrow a volume of prose or verse he carried it with him until he had read it through. While watching his flocks, he spent much of his time in reading. He loved poetry and soon began to write poems of his own. These poems were read and admired by many people.  The name of James Hogg became known all over Scotland. He was often called the Ettrick Shepherd,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],["title","Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#2)"],["body","he was the keeper of sheep near the Ettrick Water.  Many of his poems are still read and loved by children as well as by grown up men and women. Here is one:--       A BOY'S SONG        Where the pools are bright and deep,       Where the gray trout lies asleep,       Up the river and o'er the lea,       That's the way for Billy and me.        Where the blackbird sings the latest,       Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,       Where the nestlings chirp and flee,       That's the way for Billy and me.        Where the mowers mow the cleanest,       Where the hay lies thick and greenest,       There to trace the homeward bee,       That's the way for Billy and me.        Where the hazel bank is steepest,       Where the shadow falls the deepest,       Where the clustering nuts fall free,       That's the way for Billy and me.        Why the boys should drive away,       Little maidens from their play,       Or love to banter and fight so well,       That's the thing I never could tell.        But this I know, I love to play       In the meadow, among the hay--       Up the water, and o'er the lea,       That's the way for Billy and me.     THE CALIPH AND THE POET    Once upon a time there was a famous Arab [Footnote: Ar'ab.] whose name was Al Mansur. He was the ruler of all the Arabs, and was therefore called the caliph. [Footnote: Caliph (_pronounced_ ka'lif).]  Al Mansur loved poetry and was fond of hearing poets repeat their own verses. Sometimes, if a poem was very pleasing, he gave the poet a prize. One day a poet whose name was Thalibi [Footnote: Thal i'bi.] came to the caliph and recited a long poem. When he had finished, he bowed, and waited, hoping that he would be rewarded.  \"Which would you rather have\" asked the caliph, \"three hundred pieces of gold, or three wise sayings from my lips?\"  The poet wished very much to please the caliph. So he said, \"Oh, my master, everybody should choose wisdom rather than wealth.\"  The caliph smiled, and said, \"Very well, then, listen to my first wise saying: When your coat is worn out, don't sew on a new patch; it will look ugly.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" moaned the poet. \"There go a hundred gold pieces all at once.\" The caliph smiled again. Then he said, \"Listen now to my second word of wisdom. It is this: When you oil your beard, don't oil it too much, lest it soil your clothing.\"  \"Worse and worse!\" groaned the poor poet. \"There go the second hundred. What shall I do?\"  \"Wait, and I will tell you,\" said the caliph; and he smiled again. \"My third wise saying is--\"  \"O caliph, have mercy!\" cried the poet. \"Keep the third piece of wisdom for your own use, and let me have the gold.\"  The caliph laughed outright, and so did every one that heard him. Then he ordered his treasurer to pay the poet five hundred pieces of gold; for, indeed, the poem which he had recited was wonderfully fine.  The caliph, Al Mansur, lived nearly twelve hundred years ago. He was the builder of a famous and beautiful city called Bagdad.     \"BECOS! BECOS! BECOS!\"    Thousands of years ago the greatest country, in the world was Egypt.  It was a beautiful land lying on both sides of the wonderful river Nile. In it were many great cities; and from one end of it to the other there were broad fields of grain and fine pastures for sheep and cattle.  The people of Egypt were very proud; for they believed that they were the first and oldest of all nations.  \"It was in our country that the first men and women lived,\" they said. \"All the people of the world were once Egyptians.\"  A king of Egypt, whose name was Psammeticus, [Footnote: Psammeticus (_pro._ sam met'i kus).] wished to make sure whether this was true or not. How could he find out?  He tried first one plan and then another; but none of them proved anything at all. Then he called his wisest men together and asked them, \"Is it really true that the first people in the world were Egyptians?\"  They answered, \"We cannot tell you, O King; for none of our histories go back so far.\"  Then Psammeticus tried still another plan.  He sent out among the poor people of the city and found two little babies who had never heard a word spoken. He gave these to a shepherd and ordered him to bring them up among his sheep, far from the homes of men. \"You must never speak a word to them,\" said the king; \"and you must not permit any person to speak in their hearing.\"  The shepherd did as he was bidden. He took the children far away to a green valley where his flocks were feeding. There he cared for them with love and kindness; but no word did he speak in their hearing.  They grew up healthy and strong. They played with the lambs in the field and saw no human being but the shepherd.  Thus two or three years went by. Then, one evening when the shepherd came home from a visit to the city, he was delighted to see the children running out to meet him. They held up their hands, as though asking for something, and cried out, \"Becos! becos! becos!\"  [Illustration]  The shepherd led them gently back to the hut and gave them their usual supper of bread and milk. He said nothing to them, but wondered where they had heard the strange word \"becos,\" and what was its meaning.  After that, whenever the children were hungry, they cried out, \"Becos! becos! becos!\" till the shepherd gave them something to eat.  Some time later, the shepherd went to the city and told the king that the children had learned to speak one word, but how or from whom, he did not know.  \"What is that word?\" asked the king.  \"Becos.\"  Then the king called one of the wisest scholars in Egypt and asked him what the word meant.  \"Becos,\" said the wise man, \"is a Phrygian [Footnote: Phrygian (_pro_. frij'i an).] word, and it means _bread_.\"  \"Then what shall we understand by these children being able to speak a Phrygian word which they have never heard from other lips?\" asked the king.  \"We are to understand that the Phrygian language was the first of all languages,\" was the answer. \"These children are learning it just as the first people who lived on the earth learned it in the beginning.\"  \"Therefore,\" said the king, \"must we conclude that the Phrygians were the first and oldest of all the nations?\"  \"Certainly,\" answered the wise man.  And from that time the Egyptians always spoke of the Phrygians as being of an older race than themselves.  This was an odd way of proving something, for, as every one can readily see, it proved nothing.     A LESSON IN HUMILITY    One day the caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, [Footnote: Haroun-al-Raschid (_pro._ ha roon' al rash'id).] made a great feast. The feast was held in the grandest room of the palace. The walls and ceiling glittered with gold and precious gems. The table was decorated with rare and beautiful plants and flowers.  All the noblest men of Persia [Footnote: Per'sia.] and Arabia [Footnote: A ra'bi a.] were there. Many wise men and poets and musicians had also been invited.  In the midst of the feast the caliph called upon the poet, Abul Atayah, [Footnote: A'bul Ata'yah.] and said, \"O prince of verse makers, show us thy skill. Describe in verse this glad and glorious feast.\"  The poet rose and began: \"Live, O caliph and enjoy thyself in the shelter of thy lofty palace.\"  \"That is a good beginning,\" said Raschid. \"Let us hear the rest.\" The poet went on: \"May each morning bring thee some new joy. May each evening see that all thy wishes have been performed.\"  \"Good! good!\" said the caliph, \"Go on.\"  The poet bowed his head and obeyed: \"But when the hour of death comes, O my caliph, then alas! thou wilt learn that all thy delights were but a shadow.\"  [Illustration]  The caliph's eyes were filled with tears. Emotion choked him. He covered his face and wept.  Then one of the officers, who was sitting near the poet, cried out: \"Stop! The caliph wished you to amuse him with pleasant thoughts, and you have filled his mind with melancholy.\"  \"Let the poet alone,\" said Raschid. \"He has seen me in my blindness, and is trying to open my eyes.\"  Haroun-al-Raschid (Aaron the Just) was the greatest of all the caliphs of Bagdad. In a wonderful book, called \"The Arabian Nights,\" there are many interesting stories about him.     THE MIDNIGHT RIDE        Listen, my children, and you shall hear     Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.                   Longfellow.   The midnight ride of Paul Revere happened a long time ago when this country was ruled by the king of England.  There were thousands of English soldiers in Boston. The king had sent them there to make the people obey his unjust laws. These soldiers guarded the streets of the town; they would not let any one go out or come in without their leave.  The people did not like this. They said, \"We have a right to be free men, but the king treats us as slaves. He makes us pay taxes and gives us nothing in return. He sends soldiers among us to take away our liberty.\"  The whole country was stirred up. Brave men left their homes and hurried toward Boston.  They said, \"We do not wish to fight against the king, but we are free men, and he must not send soldiers to oppress us. If the people of Boston must fight for their liberty, we will help them.\" These men were not afraid of the king's soldiers. Some of them camped in Charlestown, [Footnote: Charles'town.] a village near Boston. From the hills of Charlestown they could watch and see what the king's soldiers were doing.  They wished to be ready to defend themselves, if the soldiers should try to do them harm. For this reason they had bought some powder and stored it at Concord,[Footnote: Concord (_pro_. kong'krd).] nearly twenty miles away.  When the king's soldiers heard about this powder, they made up their minds to go out and get it for themselves.  Among the watchers at Charlestown was a brave young man named Paul Revere. He was ready to serve his country in any way that he could.  One day a friend of his who lived in Boston came to see him. He came very quietly and secretly, to"]]]
