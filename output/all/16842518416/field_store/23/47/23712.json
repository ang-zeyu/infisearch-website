[38]      It would be a useless repetition of facts already stated in the     preceding pages of the present volume, to undertake separately to     prove all these points; and we shall confine ourselves in this     place to the three first very important articles. The reflection     must have suggested itself to those who have perused the New     Testament, that Christ is as frequently distinguished there by     the appellation of the \"Son of Man,\" as by that of the \"Son of     God,\" in reference no doubt to his humanity, and to the famous     prophecy contained in the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of     Isaiah: \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:\"     which Christians, on the authority of many passages in the four     Gospels, apply to Christ, although the Jews some times interpret     it of the Messiah, and some times of King Hezekiah. The Mexicans     bestowed the appellation of Topilitzin on Quetzalcohuatl, the     literal signification of which is \"our son,\" or \"our child,\"     the proper name being compounded of \"to,\" \"our,\" and \"piltzin,\"     defined by Alonso de Molina in his rare and copious vocabulary of     the Mexican and Spanish languages to be mino o nina, \"a boy or a     girl,\" and associated by him with the cognate terms of \"piltontli\"     and \"pilzintia;\" and it may not be unreasonably assumed, since     analogies, which are numerous and not isolated, as their number     increases, increase also their ratio of probability, not only that     the Mexicans were acquainted with Isaiah's famous prophecy, but to     mark their belief of the accomplishment of that prophecy, in the     person of Quetzalcohuatl, that they named him Topiltzin; no less     account of his having been born from a virgin of the daughters of     men, then because another equally celebrated prediction of the     same prophet declared that he should receive a name from that very     circumstance: \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign,     Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his     name Immanuel.\" And the proper name Topilitzin does in fact bear     a signification corresponding, if not literally, yet entirely in     substance with that of Immanuel: since \"God with us,\" which is the     interpretation of the Hebrew name, means God domiciliated amongst     men; and the full force of the expression is preserved in the term     Topilitzin, which might be interpreted the Son of Man, or God on a     level with men; for the Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl took     human nature upon him, partaking of all infirmities of man, and     was not exempt from sorrow, pain, or death, and that he suffered     voluntarily to atone for the sins of mankind. [39]  As already remarked, there is much attributed to this Deity of native American tradition that seems incompatible with the character of Messiah, and with his labors while in the western hemisphere; but for all that one may see in outline here the leading truths respecting the Son of God as made known to the Nephites through prophecies and the Christ's advent among them, all of which is set forth in the Book of Mormon; while that which is not congruous to Messiah and his mission to the Nephites, results--as already pointed out--from the confusion of a number of traditions concerning several other great characters who have figured in native American history, and of whom the Book of Mormon speaks. But, in the foregoing excerpts from the works of those skilled in the lore of ancient America, we have the account of \"The great or the glorious Man of the country,\" [40] that can be no other than the Hebrew Messiah--the Jesus Christ of the Book of Mormon. There are the signs of his birth: the signs of his death; his sudden advent among the people; his personal appearance--not incompatible with the personal appearance of Messiah, but rather in harmony with it; his birth of a virgin; his being the only son of God; his name signifying \"God with man;\" his being the creator of heaven and earth; his crucifixion for the sins of the world; his being peculiarly \"the Lord\" to whom men prayed; his love of peace, his hatred of war; his respect for existing religion, yet his enlargement of it and the addition of religious rites and ceremonies; his teaching the people perfectly in their own tongue, yet also in new and honied words; his compassion for the sick, and healing them; his choosing special disciples to teach his religion and making them priests of the same order as himself; the beauty and gentleness of his religion that stands in such marked contrast to the subsequent harsh and sanguinary superstition that darkened the lives of the natives; his instructions as to historical records; his taking with him on his departure from the country four of the principal and most virtuous youths of the city of Cholula to the sea where he separated from them and sent back messages to his followers by them, promising to return; [41] his prediction of other and white races to come and occupy the western world and rule it; his mysterious departure from the land, and his promise to return. All this, which so perfectly agrees both with the character and ministry of Messiah among the Nephites, as described in the Book of Mormon, is set forth in such clearness that it cannot be discredited because of some evident fantasies and incongruities in other parts of the traditions.

In fact all the Nephite kings seem to have performed priestly functions; while under the Republic Alma was made president of the state and high priest of the Church, (Mosiah xxix: 42), and in the fifty-third year of the Republic Nephi, the son of Helaman, was, for a time, both president of the Republic and high priest of the Church. (Helaman iii: 37 and chapter iv.)  4. The Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl united in his own person the character of king, priest and prophet. (Kingsborough, Vol. VI., p. 213). Prescott speaking of Montezuma says: \"He had been elected to the regal dignity in preference to his brothers for his several qualification both as a ruler and a priest, a combination of offices sometimes found in the Mexican candidates, as it was, more frequently, in the Egyptian.\" (Conquest of Mexico, Vol. I., p. 215). The same author speaking of the Incas of Peru says: \"As the representative of the sun he stood at the head of the priesthood and presided at the most important of the religious festivals.\" (Conquest of Peru, Vol. I., p. 41). In a note on this passage Mr. Prescott takes exception to what he calls the \"sweeping assertion\" of Carli to the effect that the royal and sacerdotal authority were blended together in Peru; yet in another passage Prescott himself compares the ancient Peruvian government with that of the Jews and says: \"The Inca was both the law giver and the law. He was not merely the representative of divinity, or like the pope, its vicegerant, but he was divinity itself.\" (Conquest of Peru, Vol. I., p. 135). Tschudi emphatically states the union of king and priest in the Incas as follows: \"Moreover, the monarchs of Peru, as children of the sun, and descendants, in a direct line, from Manco-Capac, were the high priests and oracles in religious matters. Thus uniting the legislative and executive power, the supreme command in war, absolute sovereignity in peace, and a venerated high priesthood in religious feasts, they exercised the highest power ever known to man--realized in their persons the famous union of the pope and the emperor, and more reasonably than Louis XIV., might have exclaimed: \"I am the state!\" (Peruvian Antiquities, Tschudi, pp. 74, 75).  5.

The chronology of legends, or even traditions, is very uncertain; and the variation of a few hundred years or so is not serious. The main point in the above case is that Votan came to America some hundreds of years B. C.  9. Of Lehi's family there were himself and wife, and four sons. Zoram, the servant of Laban; he married one of the daughters of Ishmael. Of Ishmael's family there was himself and wife, two married sons and five daughters. If, as it is supposed, the four sons of Lehi married the four daughters of Ishmael then there were nine families that formed the colony. Ishmael, however, died during the colony's wanderings in Arabia, and hence there were eight families that reached America in the Nephite colony. (For above facts see I. Nephi ii, vi, vii, xvi: 34).  10. I. Nephi ii.  11. Bancroft, Native Races, Vol. V., p. 166.  12. I. Nephi i, and I. Nephi ii.  13.

Perhaps the fullest and most accessible work on the subject is Bancroft's Native Races, Vol. III., pp. 248, 287; and P. De Roo's America Before Columbus, Vol. I., chapters xxii, xxiii.  26. Native Races, Bancroft, Vol. III., p. 250.  27. See II. Nephi xv: 2, 10.  28. See III. Nephi xi: 21, 28, also III. Nephi xviii: 1, 25. Compare these several passages from Nephi with the statement in the text.  29. This may simply be the traditional remembrance of the fact that the sign of the birth of Jesus was made an epoch from which the Nephites thenceforward reckoned their time. See III. Nephi ii: 4-8.  30. \"Priests after the order of Quetzalcohuatl.\" The Book of Mormon teaches that the Nephites had the high Melchizedek priesthood among them. That is to say, the priesthood of their high priests was after the same order of priesthood as that held by the son of God. Hence we have Alma saying: \"I am called to speak after this manner [he was preaching obedience to the people] according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus. * * * * * And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea to preach unto my beloved brethren.\" (Alma v: 44, 49). \"I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.\" (Alma xii: 1). The whole chapter deals with this subject of the priesthood, and should be considered as part of the reference. Jesus when instructing the twelve he had chosen from among the Nephites, said to them: \"Ye shall be judges of this people according to the judgement which I shall give unto you, which shall be just; therefore what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.\" (III. Nephi xxvii: 27). It is fairly clear, that Jesus appointed priests after his own order even as the traditions of the Mexicans teach that their deity Quetzalcohuatl appointed priests after his own order. The coincident of the tradition and the Nephite record is remarkable, and affords an item of incidental evidence of considerable importance.  31. Compare this statement with the following passage: \"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye enter into temptation. * * * * * Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name; and whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you. Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.\" (III. Nephi xviii: 12, 21).  32. Native Races, Bancroft, Vol. III., pp. 259, 260, 274. For a description of the Nephite \"golden age,\" whence comes this \"golden age\" of the tradition, see III. Nephi, chapter xxiv, xxviii.  33. With this statement compare III. Nephi xvi: 6, 16; also III. Nephi xx: 14, 20, 27, 28; also III. Nephi xxi: 12, 25. Where the Savior predicts the coming of the Gentiles to the promised land, and their privileges and responsibilities respecting it.  34. Bancroft, Native Races, Vol. III., p. 251.  35. Compare I. Nephi xi: 12-21; I. Nephi x: 4-6. Also I. Nephi xi: 21; Ether iii: 6-16.  36. Mosiah iii: 4, 5.  37. Helaman xiv: 12; Ether iii: 14-16.  38. III Nephi xi: 6-12.  39. Kingsborough's Mexican Antiquities, Vol. VI., p. 507.  40. The happy suggestion of title is De Roo's Ante, p. 298.  41. Readers of the Book of Mormon will find in this circumstance a resemblance to the fact of Jesus granting to three of the twelve disciples chosen from among the Nephites the privilege of remaining on earth without tasting death until he should return in glory. And when it is remembered that in granting this request to the three Nephites Jesus coupled the name of John, the beloved disciple, in Judea, to whom had been granted the same privilege (St. John xxi), sufficient ground work was laid for the tradition of the \"four\" \"most virtuous youths\" who were given a special mission by Quetzalcohuatl to his followers. The incident concerning the three Nephite disciples and the mention of John in connection with them will be found in III. Nephi xxviii.    CHAPTER XXXII  EXTERNAL EVIDENCES--THE HEBREW ORIGIN OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN RACES--HEBREW RELICS.  I next call attention to the evidences of the Hebrew origin of the native Americans, which origin, of course, if established beyond reasonable doubt, will be one more item of evidence--one, too, of very great weight in the volume of cumulative evidence here being compiled, since the Hebrew origin of the native American races is fundamental as testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon. The Hebrew origin of those races in our book is so unequivocally stated and so emphasized that if the said American races could be proven beyond doubt to be of other than Hebrew origin, the claims of the Book of Mormon would be shattered.  The chief sources of information on this subject are the writings of Gregoria Garcia, Edward King (Lord Kingsborough), and James Adair. The first is a Spanish Dominican author, born about 1560; he died 1627. He spent some twelve years in Central American countries as a missionary among the natives, during which time he gathered his materials for his chiefest work, \"Origin de los Indios.\" While contending for the theory that the Indians are descendants of the Ten Tribes, Garcia collected evidences on both sides of the question, though both his evidences and arguments tend to prove the theory of Hebrew origin.  Lord Kingsborough was born in 1795, and died at Dublin in 1837. His \"Antiquities of Mexico,\" ten volumes, imperial folio, were published in London between 1830-48, consequently, since he died in 1837, some of the volumes were issued after his death. His theory is that the Indians are descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel, and to the establishment of this view he bends all his energies. He is open to the charge of being over zealous for his theory, and doubtless has been somewhat extravagant in his assumptions of proofs--in matters of detail, at least; but, after all proper discount is made for the over-zeal of an enthusiast--fanatic, if you will,--there remains a body of evidence in his works for the Hebrew origin of native American races which has never been successfully disposed of by those who dispute his theory. Even Bancroft, who holds his theory in contempt, is forced to admit that his \"enthusiasm is never offensive,\" and further says of him, \"There is a scholarly dignity about his work which has never been attained by those who have jeered and railed at him.\" [1]  Adair's work, \"History of the North American Indians,\" is included in the eighth volume of Kingsborough's works. James Adair was an English trader among the North American Indians from 1735 to 1775--forty years. It was in 1775 that his work was published. His observations were confined to the North American Indians; hence these three authors may be said to cover the entire field of our investigation. I shall give extracts from all these writers, making use of Bancroft's abridgment of their works as being at once accurate and most accessible to the reader.  I.  _Garcia._  I begin with Garcia:      The opinion that the Americans are of Hebrew origin is supported by     similarities in character, dress, religion, physical peculiarities,     condition, and customs. The Americans are at heart cowardly, and     so are the Jews; the history of both nations proves this. The Jews     did not believe in the miracles of Christ, and for their unbelief     were scattered over the face of the earth, and despised of all     men; in like manner the people of the New World did not readily     receive the true faith as preached by Christ's Catholic disciples,     and are therefore persecuted and being rapidly exterminated.     Another analogy presents itself in the ingratitude of the Jews for     the many blessings and special favors bestowed on them by God.     * * * * * * Both Jews and Americans are noted for their want of     charity and kindness to the poor, sick and unfortunate; both are     naturally given to idolatry; many customs are common to both such     as raising the hands to heaven when making a solemn affirmation,     calling all near relatives brothers, showing great respect and     humility before superiors, burying their dead on hills and high     places without the city, tearing their clothing on the reception     of bad tidings, giving a kiss on the cheek as a token of peace,     celebrating a victory with songs and dances, casting out of the     place of worship women who are barren, drowning dogs in a well,     practicing crucifixion. * * * * * * * * The dress of the Hebrew     was in many points like that of the Americans. * * * * * * The     Jews preferred the flesh-pots of Egypt and a life of bondage to     heavenly manna and the promised land; the Americans liked a life of     freedom and a diet of roots and herbs, better than the service of     the Spaniards with good food. The Jews were famous for fine work     in stone, as is shown by the buildings of Jerusalem, and a similar     excellence in this art is seen in the American ruins. The Mexicans     have a tradition of a journey undertaken at the command of a god,     and continued for a long time under the direction of certain high     priests, who miraculously obtained supplies for their support, this     bears a striking resemblance to the Hebrew story of the wandering     in the desert. [2] * * * * Moreover, many traces of their old laws     and ceremonies are to be found among them at the present day.     For instance, both Jews and Americans gave their temple into the     charge of priests, burned incense, anointed the body, practiced     circumcision, kept perpetual fires on their altars, forbade women     to enter the temple immediately after giving birth, and husbands     to sleep with their wives for seven days during the period of    "]]]
