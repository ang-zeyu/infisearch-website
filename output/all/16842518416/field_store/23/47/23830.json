A moment later she disappeared from sight.  \"You shall pay for that, Captain Koenig!\" said Jack to himself, between clenched teeth.      CHAPTER VI  RECONNOITERING  Jack and Frank leaned against the lifelines, gazing over the stem of the Vaterland as the vessel's triple screws drove her ahead.  Jack's eyes were fixed thoughtfully upon the strong if crudely constructed turret on the after deck, from which protruded the glistening nose of an 8-inch gun.  His gaze wandered forward past the rakish stacks to the light bridge which spanned the Vaterland's beam.  Mounted on the bridge, in addition to the two naval telescopes, were four rapid-fire guns, each capable of spitting bullets at the rate of five hundred a minute, though, sheltered as they were under the tarpaulins, they looked harmless enough.  Frank regarded Jack curiously.  \"What's on your mind?\" he asked.  \"I was thinking,\" said Jack slowly, \"that if I could get my hands on one of those machine guns on the bridge, these Germans would wish they were home in the Kiel Canal.\"  \"You mean?\" said Frank.  \"I mean that if I had five minutes to man one of those rapid-firers up yonder I could rake this ship from stem to stern.  There'd be a few less Germans in this world before they got me.  Anyway, it's a point worth remembering.\"  Frank nodded his head.  \"It certainly is,\" he replied.  Jack resumed his study of the big ship.  Half way up each mast he saw the round-covered dots which denoted the powerful searchlights, and from the tops of the thin masts sagged the wireless aerials.  Immediately under the bridge and sheltered somewhat by it was the wireless room.  The entire ship, even to the rifle barrels, was painted the dead, neutral gray which is known as \"war color.\"  Frank followed the direction of Jack's gaze.  \"They are well prepared, aren't they?\" he said.  \"They certainly are,\" declared Jack.  \"Well,\" said Frank, \"we must remember that we are to do nothing yet. The time will come, though, and it is as well to know beforehand what we will have to contend with.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Jack.  \"That's why I am trying to impress all these things on my memory.\"  \"Come,\" said Frank, \"we'll interview the captain.\"  Jack followed his friend to the captain's cabin.  The captain expressed much pleasure at seeing them.  \"How goes everything this morning, Captain?\" asked Frank.  \"Good!\" was the response.  \"What can I do for you?\"  \"We've just been looking about the Vaterland,\" said Jack in German. \"It must have required remarkable ingenuity to have converted this ship into the formidable vessel it is now.\"  \"You think so?\" said the captain.  \"I am glad.  I did it under my own plans.\"  \"And you have had the most remarkable success,\" said Frank.  \"The Emperor will have much to thank you for when the war is over.\"  \"Ja!\" exclaimed Captain Koenig.  \"I shall have the Iron Cross.\"  \"Undoubtedly, Captain,\" declared Jack.  \"By the way, how large a crew do you carry?\"  \"Almost two hundred officers and men,\" was the reply.  \"But your prisoners,\" exclaimed Frank.  \"Surely you have many of them?\"  \"We have now more than 300 prisoners aboard this ship,\" declared Captain Koenig; \"mostly men.  Besides the women who came aboard with you, there are only five.\"  \"That's a pretty big load, Captain?\"  \"The Vaterland,\" said Captain Koenig proudly,  \"has accommodations for more than a thousand souls.\"  \"I knew it was a big ship,\" said Frank, \"but I had no idea it carried so many.  By the way, where do you keep your prisoners?\"  \"Forward, beneath the main deck,\" replied the Captain.   \"They are well guarded, of course?\"  \"Well guarded, indeed,\" was the captain's reply.  \"They are of course, unarmed and the door to their prison is locked. Besides, there are armed men on guard without every instant.\"  \"I see you, have spared no pains to keep everything safe,\" said Frank.  \"You are right, sir.  The Vaterland is in my hands, and it shall stay in my hands.  No ship of war can catch me.  I am well prepared on all sides.\"  \"Your foresight is to be commended, Captain,\" declared Jack.  \"The Kaiser has reason to be proud of you.\"  \"You think so?\" exclaimed Captain Koenig.  \"I am pleased.\"  The lads went on deck again after some further conversation.  \"He's a pretty conceited old pirate, if you ask me,\" declared Jack.  \"So he is,\" Frank agreed; \"yet when you stop to think of it he has some reason to be.  He's doing a pretty good job for the Kaiser.\"  \"A pretty bad job for the Allies,\" said Jack.  \"Which is the reason we are here,\" declared Frank.  \"Hello, here comes Miss Wheaton; I'll have a word with her.\"  He lifted his cap as he spoke.  Miss Wheaton bowed and would have passed on had not Frank intercepted her.  \"Won't you stop a moment, Miss Wheaton?\" the lad asked.  \"I wish to have nothing to do with German spies,\" returned the girl coldly.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Frank, and stepped back.  The girl passed on.  Five paces beyond, however, she stopped, turned and retraced her steps.  \"I had taken you for Americans, aboard the Algonquin,\" she declared. \"Surely you are not German?\"  \"No,\" said Frank, \"I am an American.\"  \"And are helping the enemies of your country,\" declared the girl.  \"Just a moment, Miss Wheaton,\" said Frank quietly.  He looked around hurriedly.  There was not a soul near, save Jack.  \"Do not believe all you see,\" the lad whispered.  \"You mean?\" exclaimed the girl.  Frank shrugged his shoulders.  \"Appearances are often deceitful,\" he said quietly.  Miss Wheaton looked at the lad in some amazement.  Then she said: \"I hope I do not misunderstand you.\"  \"I am sure you don't,\" said Frank with a smile.  \"The Vaterland has been engaged in her nefarious trade altogether too long.  It is time somebody put a stop to it.  Well, the time will come.\"  Miss Wheaton extended a hand, which the lad grasped.  \"I am sorry I doubted you,\" she said.  \"Why, that's all right,\" said Frank.  The girl inclined her head and passed on.  Frank turned to Jack.  \"A very nice girl,\" he said, indicating Miss Wheaton.  \"Most likely,\" Jack agreed.  \"However, you always were rather strong for the girls.  I hope you didn't tell her our business.\"  \"Why--why, no,\" said Frank, flushing.  \"I simply told her she must not believe all she sees.\"  \"Which was simply another way of telling her we are not what we represented ourselves to Captain Koenig,\" said Jack.  \"Now she'll probably go straight to the captain and tell him what she has learned.\"  \"No, she won't,\" said Frank.  \"She wouldn't do that.\"  \"How do you know she won't?\"  \"Well, I don't know it, but I don't think she will.\"  \"What you think and what she may do are likely to be altogether different,\" declared Jack.  \"You are too quick with your tongue sometimes, Frank.\"  \"But,\" Frank protested, \"she thought we were Germans and ignored us.\"  \"What do we care what she thinks?  If she ignores us so much the better to my way of thinking.\"  \"But--\" Frank began.  \"But, nothing,\" interrupted Jack.  \"We are here for a single purpose, and it makes no difference what any one thinks of us.\"  \"You are probably right, Jack,\" Frank agreed.  \"I'll have to keep a tight rein on my tongue.  However, I am sure Miss Wheaton will not betray us.\"  \"Humph!\" said Jack, and the conversation ended.  It was late that afternoon when the lookout forward gave the news that there was a ship in the offing.  Immediately the Vaterland altered her course slightly and headed for the newcomer, which it developed was a merchant ship.  \"Here comes another victim,\" said Frank.  \"You don't suppose--\" began Jack.  \"Too soon, I'm afraid,\" said Frank, with a shake of his head.  \"I wish it were, but I am afraid it is too soon.\"  Within range, the Vaterland put a shot across the bow of the stranger. The newcomer obeyed this command instantly.  She hove to.      CHAPTER VII  ABOARD THE STRANGER  It was the steamer Gloucester that the Vaterland had sighted and which had heaved to in response to the Vaterland's shot across her bow.  The Gloucester was a small steamer, more on the order of a pleasure yacht than a freight vessel.  In one of the cabins, as the vessel came to, sat a man in an invalid chair.  Beside him stood a huge negro.  \"See what the trouble is, Tom,\" ordered the invalid as the ship's engines stopped.  The negro hurried on deck, but was back in a few minutes, breathing excitedly.  \"It's the raider, suh,\" he said.  \"The Vaterland.\"  \"Good!\" said the man in the invalid's chair.  \"Wheel me on deck, Tom.\"  The negro did as ordered.  There the invalid passed the word for the captain, who came toward him.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Captain Tucker, saluting.  \"The vessel ahead, I understand,\" said the invalid, \"is the Vaterland?\"  \"It is, Mr. Hamilton.\"  \"Very good.  Call the first, second and third officers.\"  The captain obeyed and a few moments later the three officers stood before Hamilton.  \"You must not forget, gentlemen,\" said 'Hamilton, \"that we are bound simply on a pleasure cruise.  I was not willing that a German raider should interfere with the prescription of an ocean voyage ordered by, my physician.  You understand?\"  The officers nodded.  The men were: First officer, Mr. Sanborn; second officer, Mr. Partridge, and third officer, Mr. Richardson.  \"Very well, then,\" said Mr. Hamilton.  \"That is all.\"  He turned again to the negro.  \"Tom,\" he said, \"bring my bags and stow them in the cutter yonder.  We will be taken prisoners aboard the raider.\"  The negro did as commanded and again took his stand by Hamilton. \"Mind, Tom,\" said Mr. Hamilton, \"no weapons.\"  \"None, suh?\" questioned the negro.  \"Not a single one.\"  \"Well, suh,\" said the negro, \"dis ain't no weapon I got here.  I just carry it for luck, Mistah Hamilton.\"  He displayed a  pair of brass knuckles.  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Hamilton, \"but be sure you put them where they will not be found.\"  \"Dey won't find 'em,\" chuckled the negro.  He rolled up the leg of one trouser and stowed the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6072"],["title","The Boy Allies with Uncle Sam's Cruisers (#5)"],["body","knuckles carefully in the top of his sock.  As the Vaterland's small boat approached the Gloucester, Captain Tucker ordered a gangway rigged.  Mr. Hamilton's chair was wheeled to this gangway, and those aboard waited the arrival of the German officer in the small boat.  Lieutenant Blum, the Vaterland's officer, leaped nimbly over the rail.  \"The captain?\" he demanded.  Captain Tucker stepped forward.  \"I'm Captain Tucker,\" he said. \"This,\" he indicated Mr. Hamilton, \"is the owner, Mr. Hamilton, who is on a voyage for his health.\"  \"I'm sorry his health cannot be given more consideration,\" said Lieutenant Blum, \"but I am under necessity of sinking your ship.  Mr. Hamilton may continue his voyage aboard the Vaterland.\"  The prisoners were safely transferred to the Vaterland and a short time later a rumbling explosion marked the end of the steamer Gloucester.  Mr. Hamilton, through the courtesy of Captain Koenig, was assigned one of the larger cabins, near the captain's own.  Hamilton spoke to Captain Koenig in fluent German.  The German captain seemed to take considerable interest in the invalid.  As the chair of the invalid was wheeled along the deck, the invalid glanced sharply at Jack and Frank.  Neither lad manifested the slightest surprise and Mr. Hamilton was soon out of sight.  Members of the crew of the Gloucester, all except the negro Torn, who was to be allowed to tend Mr. Hamilton personally, were soon locked safely between decks and the Vaterland proceeded on her way.  Several hours later, Captain Koenig, in paying a visit to the cabin found the latter studying over a chess board.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Captain Koenig.  \"So you play chess, eh?\"  \"A little,\" said Mr. Hamilton.  \"That is fortunate,\" declared the captain.  \"I too love the game.  I shall be pleased to have you play with me at some future time.\"  \"I shall be glad, Captain,\" said Mr. Hamilton quietly.  The German commander soon took his leave.  Hamilton turned to the negro, who, upon the captain's departure, had taken the brass knuckles from his sock and was examining them carefully.  \"Tom,\" said he, \"if you don't keep those knuckles out of sight I shall heave them overboard.\"  \"Yussuh,\" exclaimed Tom, and hid the knuckles hastily.  \"Listen to me, Tom,\" said Hamilton.  \"Whenever I am in here I want you to station yourself outside the door.  And I want you to tell me before you let any one in, understand?\"  \"Yussuh.\"  \"And mind you keep those knuckles out of sight.  There'll be no use for them until I give the word. Remember that.\"  \"Yussuh.\"  There came a knock on the door and Hamilton fell back on his cushions as he ordered Tom to open the door.  A moment later girl introduced herself and then said:  \"I've come to see you because we are fellow prisoners, Mr. Hamilton, and to see if there is anything I can do for you.  I know you cannot help yourself, being an invalid.\"  Mr. Hamilton smiled.  \"Don't you worry about me, young woman,\" he said.  \"I'm not half so helpless as you think.  See?\"  Mr. Hamilton stood up, dropped the robe from his lap and skipped nimbly across the cabin.  Elizabeth Wheaton stepped back in surprise.  \"But I thought--\" she began.  \"So does Captain Koenig,\" said Hamilton with a smile.  \"By the way, Miss Wheaton, are you armed?\"  \"No.\"  Hamilton explored the seat of his chair.  He produced a box, which he opened.  There lay at least a dozen shining automatics.  Hamilton gave one to the girl.  \"Take this,\" he said simply.  \"You may have need of it, although if nothing goes wrong with my plans, all will be well.\"  The girl took the weapon and hid it in the folds of her dress.  At that moment Tom poked his head in the door indicating that some one was approaching. Miss Wheaton left the cabin without another word.  A moment later Jack and Frank entered the cabin.  Mr. Hamilton, who was again in his invalid chair covered with a robe, leaped to his feet and extended a hand to each lad.  \"By Jove!  We are glad to see you, sir,\" said Frank, \"although we did not expect you so soon.\"  \"I started sooner than I had expected,\" laughed Lord Hastings, for such Mr. Hamilton proved to be.  \"Have you found out the lay of the land?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack, and explained briefly.  He produced a long sheet of paper, which he passed to Lord Hastings.  \"What's this?\" demanded the latter.  \"Deck plan, sir,\" said Jack quietly.  \"I obtained it from Captain Koenig, sir, though he doesn't know it.\"  \"Very good,\" said Lord Hastings, and examined it carefully.  Jack put a finger to the paper.  \"There,\" he pointed out, \"is the second deck.  In here are the prisoners of the Algonquin and the Gloucester.  In the compartment below are perhaps two hundred other prisoners.  Abaft this compartment is the strong room in which are the small arms and ammunition. Lieutenant Blum carries the keys.  In there, too, are hundreds of rifles.\"  \"Very well,\" said Lord Hastings, and briefly sketched a plan of action.  Then he added:  \"This work must be done promptly and there must be no slip.  A slip means failure.  Now follow the instructions I give you.\"  He spoke softly for perhaps fifteen minutes, and when Frank and Jack took their leave at the expiration of that period, the faces of both were flushed.  \"At 11 o'clock tomorrow morning,\" Jack whispered.  \"Be a sailor,\" Frank instructed.  \"You mean six bells.\"  \"All right,\" laughed Jack.  \"Have it your own way. Six bells or 11 o'clock.  We'll be ready.\"      CHAPTER VIII  SIX BELLS   It was at 10 o'clock the following morning that Lord Hastings received a call from Captain Koenig.  \"Ah!\" exclaimed the German commander.  \"I find that I have time on my hands.  Would it be too much to ask you to have a game of chess with me now?\"  \"Indeed, no,\" was Lord Hastings' reply.  \"I shall be pleased.  I shall have my man roll me to your quarters within fifteen minutes.\"  \"Very good!\" said Captain Koenig.  He bowed and departed.  Lord Hastings quickly ordered the negro to find Frank and Jack and order them to his cabin.  A few moments more and they stood before him.  \"Frank,\" said Lord Hastings, \"you approach the bridge and stand there. When the men come from below, it may be that we will need a man near the bridge to pick off the gunner should he train one of the rapid-firers on us.  Do not move, however, unless it is necessary.  If we can reach the bridge without attracting attention by firing a shot it will be infinitely better.  Jack, you come with me.  I shall now engage the captain in a game of chess.\"  Frank stooped and from his boots brought out two automatics.  Jack did likewise.  These they put in their pockets.  Then Frank left his commander's cabin.  Above he encountered Miss Wheaton, who approached him.  \"I have learned what is about to happen,\" said the girl, \"and I want to know if I can be of some assistance.\"  \"You can help most,\" said Frank, \"by going to your cabin and staying there.  Make sure that none of the women come on deck.\"  \"But,\" said the girl, \"I had hoped to be of more value than that.\"  \"Believe me,\" said Frank, \"if you can make sure that the women remain in their cabins you will have done much.\"  Elizabeth Wheaton nodded her head.  \"None shall come out,\" she said quietly.  She turned on her heel and made her way to her own cabin. Then she summoned the other women prisoners and when they were inside she locked the door, taking care, however, that none saw her turn the key, for she did not wish to answer unnecessary questions.  Frank took a position where he could cover the bridge.  There were only two men there--the officer of the deck and the quartermaster at the wheel.  Below, Lord Hastings motioned to the giant negro to wheel him to Captain Koenig's cabin.  \"I'm depending on you, Tom,\" he said quietly.  \"When I give the word--\"  \"Yussuh!\" said Tom, grinning.  \"I'll be watching you, suh.\"  He wheeled Lord Hastings to Captain Koenig's cabin. Jack followed.  The German commander expressed his pleasure at the opportunity of matching his wits against his prisoner across the chess board.  He espied Jack and eyed him askance.  \"I'm somewhat of a chess player myself,\" Jack explained.  \"I thought I would enjoy the battle.  Mr. Hamilton, here, has no objections to my presence.\"  \"Nor have I, in that event,\" said Captain Koenig.  The chess board stood upon a small table.  The pieces were in place. Johnson wheeled Lord Hastings into position and fell into position behind him.  Captain Koenig drew up a chair.  Jack remained standing.  The ad was perfectly calm in spite of the excitement that raged in his breast.  Lord Hastings played silently and without anxiety, as though nothing were about to transpire.  Even the negro, Tom, showed nothing of the excitement that he felt.  Now and then, though, his hand touched the pair of brass knuckles which he had transferred from his sock to his right-hand pocket.  As the game progressed Captain Koenig became manifestly pleased, for he felt that he was winning.  Lord Hastings glanced at the clock.  It lacked five minutes to 11.  He looked at Tom significantly, and the negro shifted his position closer to Captain Koenig.  Suddenly six bells struck.  As the last stroke sounded, Lord Hastings, apparently accidentally, brushed one of the chessmen from the board.  \"Your pardon,\" he said to Captain Koenig.  He bent over, apparently to pick up the chessman.  Instead, his hand sought the box in his chair and when he sat straight again, his revolver covered Captain Koenig.  The commander of the Vaterland started up with an inarticulate cry.  At the same moment Tom sprang forward, and his two hands grasped the German commander's throat.  Captain Koenig was fat and he was conceited and he had been foolishly lax.  But he was a competent commander in the German navy, which means that he was a brave and resourceful man.  He allowed his body to relax in the negro's clutch.  His foot sought for and found a tiny button below the chess table.  He pressed it.  A buzzer sounded in another"]]]
