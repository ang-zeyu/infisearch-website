Some attendants came in and whisked away the snow hillocks and floor covering, leaving the ballroom once again in order for dancing.  \"Makes me feel young again, to play those kiddy games,\" said Kenneth, as he was dancing with Patty.  \"I like them,\" returned Patty; \"I hate to think that my childhood is over, and I love games of any kind.\"  \"Your childhood will never be over,\" returned Kenneth; \"I think you are the incarnation of youth, and always will be.\"  \"I'm not so much younger than you.\"  \"Five years,--that's a long time at our age. By the way, when are the Hepworths coming home?\"  \"Next week; and we're planning the loveliest reception for them. You know their apartment is all ready, and we're going to have just a few people to supper there, the night they return.\"  \"Shall I be one of the few?\"  \"Well, rather! The best man at the wedding must surely be at the home-coming. Doesn't it seem funny to think of Christine as mistress of her own home? She'll be perfectly lovely, I know. My goodness gracious! Ken, what time is it? I'm afraid I'm staying too late. I promised Nan I'd leave at half-past twelve.\"  \"It's not much more than that. Can't you stay for another dance?\"  \"No, I can't possibly. I must run right away, or my motor car will turn into a pumpkin, and Louise into a white mouse. Take me to Mrs. Homer, please, and I will say good-night to her.\"  But as they crossed the room, they met Van Reypen coming toward them.  \"Our dance, I think,\" he said, coolly, as he took Patty's hand.  The music had just started, and its beautiful rhythm was too tempting for Patty to resist.  \"I'm just on my way home,\" she said, \"but we'll go around the room once, and then I must go.\"  \"Once indeed!\" said Philip, gaily; \"we won't stop until the music does.\"  \"Yes, we will; I must go now,\" but somehow or other they circled the room several times. Patty loved dancing, and Philip was one of the best of partners.  But at last she laughingly protested that she really must go home, and they went together to say good-night to their hostess. And then Patty said good-night to Philip, and ran away to the dressing-room, where Louise was patiently waiting for her.  And soon, muffled up in her furs, they were rapidly spinning along toward home.  \"I didn't keep you waiting very long, did I, Louise?\" said Patty, kindly.  \"No, Miss Patty, you're right on time. I expect you would have liked to stay longer.\"  \"Yes, I should, but I promised Mrs. Fairfield not to.\"  When at last Patty reached her own little boudoir, she declared she was more tired than she had realised. So Louise took off her pretty frock, and Patty sat in her blue silk dressing gown while the maid brushed her hair. Then she brought her a cup of hot milk, and left her for the night.  Patty wasn't sleepy, and she dawdled around her room, now and then sipping the milk, and then looking over her engagements for the next day.  \"Oh,\" she thought, suddenly, \"I've left my fan at the party. I'm sorry, for it's my pet fan. Of course it will be safe there, but I think I'll telephone Marie to look it up and put it away.\"  Knowing that the Homers would not yet have retired, Patty picked up her telephone and called the number.  A masculine voice gave back a cheery \"Hello!\"  \"Is this Mr. Homer?\" said Patty.  \"No, indeed. I'm Kit Cameron. Who are you, please?\"  \"Isn't this The Wimbledon apartment house?\"  \"It sure is.\"  \"Isn't this 6483?\"  \"No, it's 6843. Please tell me who you are?\"  A spirit of mischief entered into Patty. She knew this must be Marie Homer's cousin, who lived on the floor above the Homers, and who, Mrs. Homer had said, detested girls.  \"But I have the wrong number,\" she said. \"I didn't mean to call you.\"  \"But since you did call me, you must tell me who you are.\"  \"I'm a captive princess,\" said Patty, in rather a melancholy tone. \"I'm imprisoned in the dungeon of a castle.\"  \"How awful! May I get a squad of soldiers and come to your rescue, oh, fair lady?\"  \"Nay, nay, Sir Knight; and anyway you do not know that I am a fair lady.\"  \"Your voice tells me that. Surely such musical tones could belong only to the most beautiful princess in the world.\"  \"Oh, yes, I am THAT,\" and Patty laughed, roguishly; \"but a well-behaved princess would not be talking to a strange man. So I must say good-bye.\"  \"Oh, no, no! wait a minute; you haven't told me your name yet.\"  \"And I don't intend to. You detest girls, anyway.\"  \"Yes, I always have, but you see I never met a princess before.\"  \"You haven't met me yet.\"  \"But I shall! Don't make any mistake about that.\"  \"How can you? I'm going to ring off now, and you have no way of tracing me.\"  \"I can find out from Central.\"  \"No, you can't.\"  \"Why can't I?\"  \"Because I forbid you to do so.\"  \"All right; then I can't find out that way, but I'll find out some other way. I'll go on a quest.\"  \"Goodness, what is a quest?\"  \"Oh, it just means that I henceforth devote my whole life to finding you.\"  \"But you can't find me, when you don't know my name.\"  \"I'll make up a name for you. I'll call you Princess Poppycheek.\"  \"How could you guess I'm a brunette?\"  \"I can tell it from your voice. You have snapping black eyes and dark curly hair, and the reddest of red cheeks.\"  \"Exactly right!\" exclaimed Patty, giggling to think how far this description was from her blonde pink-and-white type.  \"I knew it was right!\" exclaimed the voice, exultantly; \"and I shall find you very soon.\"  \"Then I shall await your coming with interest. You prefer brunettes, do you?\"  \"Well, as a matter of fact, I have always admired blondes more, but I'm quite willing to change my tastes for you. Do you sing?\"  For answer, Patty sang softly into the telephone, the little song of \"Beware, take care, she is fooling thee.\"  Although she did little more than hum it, Mr. Cameron was greatly impressed with her voice.  \"By jove!\" he exclaimed. \"You CAN sing! Now, I can find you easily. There are not many voices like that in this wicked world.\"  \"Do you sing yourself? But I don't want to know, I haven't the least interest in a stranger, and besides, I'm going to ring off now.\"  \"Oh, wait a minute! I don't sing, but I do something better. Don't ring off, just listen a minute.\"  Patty listened, and in a moment she heard a violin played softly. It was played by a master hand, and she heard an exquisite rendition of the \"Spring Song.\"  \"Beautiful!\" she exclaimed, as the last notes died away, and then suddenly realising that she herself was acting in a most unconventional manner, she said abruptly, \"Thank you; good-bye,\" and quickly hung up her receiver.  For some time she sat thinking about it. Curled up in a big easy chair, her blue silk boudoir gown trailing around her, she sat giggling over her escapade.  \"It's all right,\" she assured herself, \"for of course I know who he is, though he doesn't know me. He is Mrs. Homer's nephew, so it's just the same as if I had met him properly. And, anyhow, he hasn't an idea who I am, and he never can find out from the description he has of me!\"  Still giggling over the episode, Patty went to bed and to sleep.  The next morning, as she thought it over, she realised that she hadn't succeeded in securing her fan, and she determined to go around and see Marie that afternoon, and get it.  So that afternoon she went to make her call.  \"It was a beautiful party,\" she said to Marie, as the two girls chatted together. \"I love games for a change from dancing, and the games you had were so novel.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say that,\" said Marie, \"for I was afraid they would seem too childish.\"  \"No, indeed,\" returned Patty; \"and now put on your hat and come out with me for a little while. I'm going to a picture exhibition, and I'd love to have you go too. But first, did I leave my fan here last evening?\"  \"There was a beautiful fan left here,--an Empire fan. Is this yours?\"  Marie produced the fan and Patty recognised it as her own.  \"But I can't go this afternoon,\" said Marie, \"because Cousin Kit is coming down to practise some new music. Won't you stay and hear him play? He is really a very good violinist.\"  Patty considered. She rather wanted to meet this young man, but she was afraid he would think her forward. So after a little further chat, she rose, saying she must go. And it was just as she was going out that Mr. Cameron came in, with his violin under his arm.  Patty was obliged to pause a moment, as Marie presented her cousin, but the young man, though courteous, showed no interest whatever in Miss Fairfield. Patty's pretty face was almost invisible through her motor veil, and as Mr. Cameron had no idea that she was the girl who had talked to him the night before, and as he really had no interest in girls in general, he merely made a very polite bow and went directly toward the piano.  \"I wish you'd stay and hear some music,\" said Marie, but Patty only murmured a refusal, not wanting Mr. Cameron to hear her voice, lest he recognise it.  He was an attractive looking man of fine physique and handsome face, but he looked extremely dignified and not very good-natured.  \"All musicians are cross,\" Patty thought to herself as she went down in the elevator, \"and I wasn't going to have that man think that I went around to Marie's to see him!\"  She decided to call for Elise to go to the art gallery with her, and she found that young woman ready and glad to go.  \"I hadn't a thing to do this afternoon,\" said Elise, as they started off, \"and I love to go anywhere with you, Patty. Shall we have a cup of tea afterwards?\"  And so it was after they had seen the pictures, and as they were sitting in a cosy little tea-room, that Elise said suddenly:  \"Do you know Mr. Cameron? He's a cousin of Marie Homer's.\"  \"I don't know him,\" said Patty, smiling, \"but I've been introduced to him. Just as I was leaving Marie's to-day, he came in. But he was very abstracted in his manner. He merely bowed, and without a word he went straight on to the piano and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5631"],["title","Patty's Suitors (#3)"],["body","fussing with his music.\"  \"You were just leaving, anyway?\"  \"Yes; but I would have remained a few moments, if he had been more sociable. But, of course, I couldn't insist on his talking to me, if he didn't want to.\"  \"He doesn't like girls,\" said Elise, but as she spoke she smiled in a self-conscious way.  \"So I've heard,\" said Patty, smiling herself. \"He seems young to be what they call a woman-hater. I thought only old bachelors were that. Well, he has no interest for me. There are plenty of boys in our own set.\"  \"Don't you tell, if I tell you something,\" and now Elise looked decidedly important.  \"What is it? I won't tell.\"  \"Well, it's the funniest thing! That Mr. Cameron wants to meet me, though he never has seen me.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Patty, in astonishment. \"Why does he want to meet you?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure. But he was at Marie's this morning, and asked her if she knew any girl who was gay and merry and had a sweet voice, and had dark hair and eyes and rosy cheeks. And Marie says she knows he means me, and I think he does too! Isn't it exciting?\"  \"Yes,\" said Patty, drily. \"But you don't sing much, Elise.\"  \"Oh, of course I don't sing like you do, but I have a fairly decent voice.\"  \"But how mysterious it is. What does he know about you?\"  \"I don't know. It IS mysterious. He wouldn't tell Marie anything except that he wanted to know the name of the girl he described; and he said she must be friendly enough with Marie to call her up on the telephone in the middle of the night.\"  \"But did you do that?\" asked Patty, who was really shaking with laughter.  \"Yes; I called her up last night after I got home from the party, because I'd left my spangled scarf there, and I wanted her to put it away safely for me.\"  \"I always leave things at a party, too,\" said Patty, looking innocent. \"I left my fan at Marie's last night. So I went there to-day and got it.\"  \"Well, I thought I'd better telephone, for so many girls leave things and they get scattered or lost.\"  \"Well, what did your telephoning have to do with Mr. Cameron?\"  \"I don't know; that's the queer part of it. Perhaps the wires were crossed and he heard me talking.\"  \"H'm,\" said Patty, \"perhaps he did. When are you going to meet him, Elise?\"  \"I don't know; but Marie says she'll have a few friends to tea some day soon, and she'll ask him. She says it'll have to be a very small tea, because he hates to meet people.\"  \"Why doesn't she have just you two? I think it would be more romantic.\"  \"Oh, nonsense. This isn't romance. I think Mr. Cameron is a freak, anyway. But it's all amusing, and I hope you'll be at the tea, yourself, Patty.\"  \"I will if I'm asked,\" said Patty.     CHAPTER III  THE HEPWORTHS AT HOME   It was the day of Christine's home-coming, and Patty was busy as a bee preparing for the great event. The pretty apartment where the Hepworths were to live was all furnished and equipped, but Patty was looking after the dainty appointments of a party.  Not a large party, only about a dozen of their own set. Nan was there, too, and Elise Farrington, and they were arranging flowers in bowls and jars and vases, till the rooms were a bower of blossoms.  \"What time will they arrive?\" said Elise.  \"We expected them about six o'clock,\" returned Patty; \"but I had a telegram, and their train is delayed, so they can't get here until nine. So I want the party all assembled when they come. It's five now, and everything's about done, so we can scoot home and get some dinner and get dressed, and be back here before they arrive. I'll be here by half-past eight, for the caterers are coming then, and I want to see about the table.\"  So they all went home to dress, and before half-past eight Patty was back again.  There were two maids already installed, but Patty found plenty to do in superintending matters, and she hadn't much more than completed the decorations of the table, when the guests began to come.  \"Isn't the apartment lovely?\" exclaimed Mona Galbraith, as she went through the rooms. \"This music-room, or living-room, or whatever you call it, is just dear! Who selected the furnishings?\"  \"Oh, Mr. Hepworth and Christine,\" said Patty; \"two artists, you know; of course the rooms ought to be beautiful. It is a lovely place, and just the right setting for that darling of a Christine.\"  The whole merry crowd were assembled in the living-room, when the bride and groom arrived. A shout of welcome went up from the young people, and Christine was smothered in girlish embraces, while the men vigorously shook Mr. Hepworth's hand, or clapped him on the shoulder, in their masculine way of congratulation.  Christine looked very sweet and smiling, in a pretty travelling gown, but Patty carried her off at once and insisted that she get into a house gown.  \"The idea,\" said Patty, \"of a hostess in a high-collared frock and all her guests in evening dress!\"  So Christine quickly changed to a little chiffon gown of pale green and Patty tucked a pink rose in her hair and some more in her belt.  \"Now you look like a bride,\" said Patty, nodding approval at her, and leading her to a mirror; \"look at that vision of beauty! Aren't you glad I made you change?\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Christine, in mock humility; \"it's much better so.\"  The evening was a merry one. They danced and they sang and they chatted and finally they had the delightful supper that Patty had ordered.  Christine, blushing prettily, took the head of the table, while Gilbert Hepworth, with a proud air of proprietorship, sat at the other end.  Patty, as guest of honour, sat at the right hand of her host.  \"It has always been my aspiration,\" she said, with a beaming smile at Christine, \"to have a married friend to visit. I warn you, Christine, I shall spend most of my time here. There's one little nook of a bedroom I claim as my own and I expect to occupy it very frequently. And, besides, I have to give you lessons in housekeeping. You're a great artist, I know, but you must learn to do lots of other things beside paint.\"  \"I wish you would, Patty,\" and the little bride looked very much in earnest; \"I truly want to keep house, but being an artist and a Southern girl both, I don't believe I'm very capable.\"  \"You're a blessed dear, that's what YOU are\"; and Patty turned to Hepworth, saying, \"Isn't she?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" he returned; \"I've only just begun to realise the beautiful qualities in her nature. And it is to you, Patty, that I owe my happiness. I shall never forget what you did in order that Christine might come to New York.\"  \"And now we are surprised at the result,\" said Patty, who never could be serious for long at a time. \"Come on, people, you've had enough supper, let's have one more dance and then we must go home and leave these turtledoves to their own nest.\"  But the one dance proved to mean several, until at last Patty said, \"This will never do! Christine is all tired out, and as the superintendent of this party I order you all to go home at once.\"  The others laughingly agreed, except Philip Van Reypen, who came near Patty and murmured, \"You haven't danced with me once to-night, and you've been awful cruel to me lately, anyway. Now let us have one more dance in honour of the bride's home-coming.\"  \"No,\" said Patty, firmly, \"not another dance to-night.\"  \"Just a part of one, then,\" begged Philip; but Patty was inexorable.  And so the merry crowd dispersed, Patty lingering a moment to give Christine a good-night kiss and wish her every blessing and happiness in her new home.  \"And I have you to thank for it all, Patty dear,\" said Christine, her blue eyes looking lovingly into Patty's own.  \"Nonsense, thank your own sweet self. You well deserve the happiness that has come to you. And now good-night, dear; I'll be over some time to-morrow.\"  The laughing group went away, and as it had been planned, Mona took Patty home in her car.  \"I wish you'd go on home with me, Patsy,\" said Mona, as they rolled along toward Patty's house.  \"Can't possibly do it. I've a thousand and one things to look after to-morrow morning.\"  \"But it isn't late; really it's awfully early. And I'll send you home early to-morrow morning.\"  \"No, I mustn't, really, Mona. I have to look after some things for the Happy Saturday Club, which it won't do to neglect. And I want to run over to Christine's to-morrow morning, too. I have some things to take to her.\"  \"Do you know, Patty, I think they're an awfully humdrum couple.\"  \"Who? The Hepworths? Oh, I don't think humdrum is the right word,--they're just serious-minded.\"  \"But Mr. Hepworth is so old and prosy, and Christine seems to me just a little nonentity.\"  \"Now, Mona, that isn't fair. Just because you are a frivolous-headed butterfly of fashion, you oughtn't to disdain people who happen to have one or two ideas in their heads.\"  \"Well, the only ideas they have are about pictures.\"  \"Pictures are good ideas.\"  \"Yes, good enough, of course. But there's no fun in them.\"  \"That's the whole trouble with the Hepworths. They haven't any fun in them. Neither of them has a sense of humour. But that's good, too; for if one had and the other hadn't, they'd be miserable for life. But as it is they don't know what they miss.\"  \"No, they don't. Patty, don't ever marry a man without a sense of humour.\"  \"Trust your Aunt Patty for that. But I don't propose to marry anybody.\"  \"Of course not; he'd propose to you.\"  \"Funny Mona! Don't let your sense of humour run away with you. Well, this facetious 'he' that you conjured up in your imagination may propose all he likes; I sha'n't accept him,--at least not for many years. I mean to have a lot of fun before I get engaged. Can you imagine me settled down in a little apartment like Christine's, devoting myself to domestic duties?\"  \"No; but I can fancy you married to a millionaire with two or three country houses and yachts and all sorts of things.\"  \"Good gracious, Mona. I don't aspire to all that! Just because YOU're a millionairess, yourself, you needn'"]]]
