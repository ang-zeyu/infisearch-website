So in his eyes, and probably in those of a higher power, this apparently ignoble act would redound no little to the credit of the girl's heart.  Charles listened to this explanation with a silent shrug of the shoulders.  Such a deed could scarcely be otherwise regarded by the priest, but Barbara's disregard of his first gift offended him far more than the excellent disposition evinced by the hasty act pleased him.  She had flung the first tangible token of his love into the insatiable jaws of a worthless profligate, like a copper coin thrown as alms to a beggar. It grieved the soul of the economical manager and lover of rare works of art to have this ancient and also very valuable family heirloom broken to pieces.  Malfalconnet would not fail to utter some biting jest when he heard that Charles must now, as it were, purchase this costly ornament of himself.  He would have forgiven Barbara everything else more easily than this mad casting away of a really royal gift.  Expressing his indignation to the almoner without reserve, he closed the interview with him.  When Charles was again alone he tried to rise, in order, while pacing up and down the room, to examine his resolution once more.  But his aching foot prevented this plan and, groaning aloud, he sank back into his arm-chair.  His heart had not been so sore for a long time, and it was Barbara's fault.  Yet he longed for her.  If she had laid her delicate white hand upon his brow, he said to himself, or had he been permitted to listen to even one of her deeply felt religious songs, it would have cheered his soul and even alleviated his physical suffering.  Several times he stretched his hand toward the bell to send for her; but she had offended him so deeply that he must at least let her feel how gravely she had erred, and that the lion could not be irritated unpunished, so he conquered himself and remained alone.  The sense of offended majesty strengthened his power of resisting the longing for her.  Indignant with himself, he again drew the maps toward him.  But like a cloth fluttering up and down between a picture and the beholder, memories of Barbara forced themselves between him and the plans over which he was bending.  This could not continue!  Perhaps, after all, her singing was the only thing which could restore his lost composure.  He longed for it even more ardently than for her face.  If he sent for her, he could show her by his manner what fruit her transgressions had borne.  The rest would follow as a matter of course. Now every fibre of his being yearned for the melody of her voice.  Obeying a hasty resolution, he rang the bell and ordered Adrian to call Quijada and command Barbara to sing in the Golden Cross that afternoon.  After the valet had replaced his aching foot in the right position, Don Luis appeared.  Without any further comment the Emperor informed him that he had determined to sever the bond of love which united him to the singer.  While speaking, he looked his friend sharply in the face, and when he saw, by his silent bow, that his decision called forth no deeper emotion in him, he carelessly added that, nevertheless, he intended to hear her sing that day, and perhaps many times more.  Perceiving a significant smile upon the lips of the faithful follower, and recognising the peril contained in the last resolve, he shook his finger at Quijada, saying: \"As if even the inmost recesses of your soul were concealed from me!  You are asking yourself, Why does Charles deny me leave to visit Villagarcia, and thereby cruelly prevent my being happy with my dear, beautiful young wife, after so long a separation, if he considers himself strong enough to turn his back, without further ceremony, upon the woman he loves, after seeing and hearing her again?\"  Your Majesty has read correctly,\" replied Don Luis, \"yet my wish for a brief stay with Doha Magdalena de Ulloa is very different from your Majesty's desire.\"  \"How?\" demanded Charles in a sharp tone of inquiry.  \"Is my strength of will, in your opinion, so far inferior to yours?\"  \"Your Majesty can scarcely deem me capable of so presumptuous an error,\" replied Quijada.  \"But your Majesty is Charles V, who has no superior save our Lord in heaven.  I, on the contrary, am only a Castilian nobleman, and as such prize my honour as my highest treasure; but, above all other things, even above the lady of my heart, stands the King.\"  \"I might know that,\" cried the Emperor, holding out his hand to his friend.  \"Yet I refused you the leave of absence, you faithful fellow. The world calls this selfishness.  But since it still needs me, it ought in justice to excuse me, for never have I needed you so much as during these decisive weeks, whether war is declared--and it will come to that-- or not.  Think how many other things are also impending!  Besides, my foot aches, and my heart, this poor heart, bears a wound which a friend's careful hand will soothe.  So you understand, Luis, that the much- tormented Charles can not do without you just now.\"  Quijada, with sincere emotion, bent over the monarch's hand and kissed it tenderly, but the Emperor, for the first time, hastily stroked his bearded cheek, and said in an agitated tone, \"We know each other.\"  \"Yes, your Majesty,\" cried the Spaniard.  \"In the first place, I will not again annoy my master with the request for a leave of absence.  Dona Magdalena must try how she can accommodate herself to widowhood while she has a living husband, if the Holy Virgin will only permit me to offer your Majesty what you expect from me.\"  \"I will answer for that,\" the Emperor was saying, when Adrian interrupted him.  The messenger had returned from Prebrunn with the news that the singer had taken cold the day before, and could not leave the house.  Charles angrily exclaimed that he knew what such illness meant, and his under lip protruded so far that it was easy to perceive how deeply this fresh proof of Barbara's defiance and vanity incensed him.  But when the chamberlain said that the singer had been attacked by a violent fever, Charles changed colour, and asked quickly in a tone of sincere anxiety: \"And Dr. Mathys?  Has he seen her?  No?  Then he must go to her at once, and I shall expect tidings as soon as he returns. Perhaps the fever was seething in her blood yesterday.\"  He had no time to make any further remarks about the sufferer, for one visitor followed another.  Shortly before noon the Bishop of Arras ushered in Duke Maurice, who wished to take leave of him.  Granvelle, in a businesslike manner, summed up the result of the negotiations, and Charles made no objection; but after he had said farewell to the Saxon prince, he remarked, with a smile which was difficult to interpret: \"One thing more, my dear Prince.  The beautiful singer has suffered from the gagliarde, which she had the honour of dancing with you; she is lying ill of a fever.  We will, however, scarcely regard it as an evil omen for the agreements which we concluded on the same day.  With our custom of keeping our hands away from everything which our friendly ally claims as his right, our alliance, please God, will not fail to have good success.\"  A faint flush crimsoned the intelligent face of the Saxon duke, and an answer as full of innuendo as the Emperor's address was already hovering on his lips, when the chief equerry's entrance gave him power to restrain it.  Count Lanoi announced that his Highness's travelling escort was ready, and the Emperor, with an air of paternal affection, bade the younger sovereign farewell.  As soon as the door had closed behind Maurice, Charles, turning to Granvelle, remarked, \"The Saxon cousin returned our clasp of the hand some what coldly, but the means of rendering it warmer are ready.\"  \"The Elector's hat,\"  replied the Bishop of Arras.  \"I hope it will prevent him from making our heads hot, as the Germans say, instead of his own.\"  \"If only our brains keep cool,\" replied the Emperor.  \"It is needful in dealing with this young man.\"  \"He knows his Machiavelli,\" added the statesman, \"but I think the Florentine did not write wholly in vain for us also.\"  \"Scarcely,\" observed the Emperor, smiling, and then rang the little bell to have his valet summon Dr. Mathys.  The leech had returned from his visit to Barbara, and feared that the burning fever from which she was suffering might indicate the commencement of inflammation of the lungs.  Charles started up and expressed the desire to be conveyed at once in the litter to Prebrunn; but the physician declared that his Majesty's visit would as certainly harm the feverish girl as going out in such weather would increase the gout in his royal master's foot.  The monarch shrugged his shoulders, and seized the despatches and letters which had arrived.  The persons about him suffered severely from his detestable mood, but the dull weather of this gloomy day appeared also to have a bad effect upon the confessor De Soto, for his lofty brow was scarcely less clouded than the sky.  He did not allude to Barbara by a single word, yet she was the cause of his depression.  After his conversation with the sovereign he had retired to his private room, to devote himself to the philological studies which he pursued during the greater portion of the day with equal zeal and success.  But he had scarcely begun to be absorbed in the new copy of the best manuscript of Apuleius, which had readied him from Florence, and make notes in the first Roman printed work of this author, when Cassian interrupted him.  He had missed the servant in the morning.  Now the fellow, always so punctual when he had not gazed too deeply into the wine-cup, stood before him in a singular plight, for he was completely drenched, and a disagreeable odour of liquor exhaled from him.  The flaxen hair, which bristled around his head and hung over his broad, ugly face, gave him so unkempt and imbecile an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5567"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 07 (#5)"],["body","that it was repulsive to the almoner, and he harshly asked where he had been loitering.  But Cassian, confident that his master's indignation would soon change to approval and praise, rapidly began to relate what had occurred outside the little castle at Prebrunn when the festival under the lindens was over.  After helping to place the Wittenberg theologian in custody, he had followed Barbara at some distance during her nocturnal walk.  While she waited in front of Dr. Hiltner's house and talked with the members of the syndic's family after their return, he had remained concealed in the shadow of a neighbouring dwelling, and did not move until the doctor had gone away with the singer.  He cautiously glided behind them as far as the garden, witnessed the syndic's cordial farewell to his companion, and dogged the former to the Prebrunn jail.  Here he had again been obliged to wait patiently a long while before the doctor came out into the open air with the prisoner.  The rope had been removed from Erasmus's hands, and Cassian had remained at his heels until he stopped in the village of Kager, on the Nuremberg road.  The young man had taken a lunch in the tavern there; the money for it was given him by the syndic.  Cassian had seen the gold pieces which had been placed in Erasmus's hand, to pay his travelling expenses, glitter in the rosy light of dawn.  In reply to the almoner's question whether he remembered any portion of the conversation between the syndic and the singer, Cassian admitted that he had been obliged to keep too far away from them to hear it, but Dr. Hiltner's manner to the girl had been very friendly, especially when he took leave of her.  The anything but grateful manner with which the almoner received this story was a great disappointment to the overzealous servant; nay, he secretly permitted himself to doubt his master's wisdom and energy when the latter remarked that the arrest of a man who had merely entered a stranger's garden was entirely unjustifiable, and that he was aware of the singer's acquaintanceship with the Hiltners.  With these words he motioned Cassian to the door.  When the prelate was again alone he gazed thoughtfully into vacancy.  He understood human beings sufficiently well to know that Barbara had not deceived him in her confession.  In spite of the nocturnal walk with the head of the Ratisbon heretics, she was faithful to the Catholic Church.  Erasmus's visit at night alone gave him cause for reflection, and suggested the doubt whether he might not have interceded too warmly for this peculiar creature and her excitable artist nature.     CHAPTER III.  Silence pervaded the little castle in Prebrunn; nay, there were days when a thick layer of straw in the road showed that within the house lay some one seriously ill, who must be guarded from every sound.  In Ratisbon and the Golden Cross, on the contrary, the noise and bustle constantly increased.  On the twenty-eighth of May, King Ferdinand arrived with his family to visit his brother Charles.  The Reichstag would be opened on the fifth of June, and attracted to the Danube many princes and nobles, but neither the Elector John of Saxony nor the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, the heads of the Smalcald league.  King Ferdinand's two daughters were to be married the first of July, and many a distinguished guest came to Ratisbon in June.  Besides, several soldiers began to appear.  The Emperor Charles's hours were filled to the brim with work and social obligations.  The twinges of the gout had not wholly disappeared, but remained bearable.  The quiet good-breeding of the two young archduchesses pleased the Emperor, and their young brother Maximilian's active mind and gay, chivalrous nature delighted him, though many a trait made him, as well as the confessor, doubt whether he did not incline more toward the evangelical doctrine than beseemed a son of his illustrious race.  But Charles himself, in his youth, had not been a stranger to such leanings. If Maximilian was intrusted with the reins of government, he would perceive in what close and effective union stood the Church and the state.  Far from rousing his opposition by reproaches, the shrewd uncle won his affection and merely sowed in his mind, by apt remarks, the seeds which in due time would grow and bear their fruit.  The Austrians watched with sincere admiration the actually exhausting industry of the illustrious head of their house, for he allowed himself only a few hours' sleep, and when Granvelle had worked with him until he was wearied, he buried himself, either alone or with some officers of high rank, in charts of the seat of war, in making calculations, arranging the levying of recruits and military movements, and yet did not withdraw from the society of his Viennese relatives and other distinguished guests.  Still, he did not forget Barbara.  The leech was daily expected to give a report of her health, and when, during the middle of June, Dr. Mathys expressed doubts of her recovery, it rendered him so anxious that his relatives noticed it, and attributed it to the momentous declaration of war which was on the eve of being made.  When the sufferer at last began to recover, his selfishness was satisfied with the course of events.  True, he thought of the late springtime of love which he had enjoyed as an exquisite gift of Fortune, and when he remembered many a tender interview with Barbara a bright smile flitted over his grave countenance.  But, on the whole, he was glad that this love affair had come to so honourable an end.  The last few weeks had claimed his entire time and strength so rigidly and urgently that he would have been compelled to refuse Barbara's demands upon his love or neglect serious duties.  Besides, a meeting between Barbara and his nephew and young nieces could scarcely have been avoided, and this would have cast a shadow upon the unbounded reverence and admiration paid him by the wholly inexperienced, childlike young archduchesses, which afforded him sincere pleasure.  The confessor had taken care to bring this vividly before his mind.  While speaking of Barbara with sympathizing compassion, he represented her illness as a fresh token of the divine favour which Heaven so often showed to the Emperor Charles, and laid special stress upon the disadvantages which the longer duration of this love affair-- though in itself, pardonable, nay, even beneficial--would have entailed.  Queen Mary's boy choir was to remain in Ratisbon some time longer, and whenever the monarch attended their performances--which was almost daily- the longing for Barbara awoke with fresh strength.  Even in the midst of the most arduous labour he considered the question how it might be possible to keep her near him--not, it is true, as his favourite, but as a singer, and his inventive brain hit upon a successful expedient.  By raising her father to a higher rank, he might probably have had her received by his sister Mary among her ladies in waiting, but then there would always have been an unwelcome temptation existing.  If, on the other hand, Barbara would decide to take the veil, an arrangement could easily be made for him to hear her often, and her singing might then marvellously beautify the old age, so full of suffering and destitute of pleasure, that awaited him.  He realized more and more distinctly that it was less her rare beauty than the spell of her voice and of her art which had constrained him to this late passion.  The idea that she would refuse to accept the fate to which he had condemned her was incomprehensible to his sense of power, and therefore did not occur to his mind.  Yet, especially when he was bearing pain, he did not find it difficult to silence even this wish for the future, for then memories of the last deeply clouded hours of their love bond forced themselves upon him.  He saw her swinging like a Bacchante in the dance with the young Saxon duke; the star which had been thrown away appeared before his eyes, and his irritated soul commanded him never to see her again.  But the suffering of a person whom we have once loved possesses a reconciling power, and he who usually forgot no insult, even after the lapse of years, was again disposed to forgive her, and reverted to the wish to continue to enjoy her singing.  When, before their wedding day, he gave his nieces the diadems which Jammtzer had made for them, his resentment concerning the ornament sold by Barbara again awoke.  He could no longer punish her for this \"loveless\" deed, as he called it, but he made the marquise feel severely enough his indignation for her abuse of the young girl's inexperience, for, without granting her a farewell audience, he sent her back to Brussels, with letters to Queen Mary expressing his displeasure. Instead of her skilful maid Alphonsine, a clumsy Swabian girl accompanied her--the former had married Cassian.  Barbara heard nothing of all these things; her recovery was slow, and every source of anxiety was kept from her.  She had never been ill before, and to be still at a time when every instinct urged her to battle for her life happiness and her love, to prove the power of her beauty and her art, put her slender stock of patience to the severest test.  During the first few days she was perfectly conscious, and watched with keen suspense what was passing around her.  It made her happy to find that Charles sent his own physician to her but, on the other hand, she was deeply and painfully agitated by his failure to grant the entreaty which she sent by Dr. Mathys to let her see his face, even if only for a moment.  Gombert and Appenzelder, Massi, the Wollers from the Ark, Dr. Hiltner's wife and daughter, the boy singer Hannibal, and many gentlemen of the court-nay, even the Bishop of Arras--came to inquire for her, and Barbara had strictly enjoined Frau Lerch to tell her everything that concerned her; for every token of sympathy filled the place, as it were, of"]]]
