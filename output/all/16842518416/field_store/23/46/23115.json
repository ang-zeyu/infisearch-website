There was no cloth on; for this was an article which Martin did not number among his possessions. Floy had substituted two towels, which, united, covered perhaps half the table.  A portion of the loaf—for there was but one—she had toasted by the fire, and this had been placed on a separate plate from the other. On the whole, therefore, though it was far from being a sumptuous repast, every thing looked clean and neat; and this alone adds increased zest to the appetite. At least, Martin felt more of an appetite than usual; and, between them, the two despatched all that had been provided.  “Is there any more bread in the closet?” asked Martin.  “No,” said Floy: “it is all gone.”  “Then I must bring some home when I return to supper.”  “I have been thinking,” said Floy, hesitatingly, “that, if you would trust me to do it, and would bring home the materials, I would make some bread; and that would be cheaper than buying it; and, besides, it would give me something to do.”  “What!” asked Martin, as he looked, with an air of surprise, at the diminutive form of little Floy, “do you know how to make bread? How came a child like you to learn?”  “Mother used to be sick a good deal,” said Floy, “and was confined to her bed, so that she could do nothing herself. She used to direct me what to do; so that, after a while, I came to know how to cook as well as she.”  “Well, what shall I have to bring home?” asked the miser, whom the hint of its being cheaper had enlisted in favor of the plan.  “Let me see,” said Floy, as she sat down and began to reflect: “there’s flour and saleratus and salt. But we’ve got the salt; so you need only get the first two.”  “Very well; I will attend to it. Oh! I forgot to ask what sewing you knew how to do. Can you make shirts?”  “Yes; I have made a good many.”  “Then I will bring you home some to-night, if I can get any.”  When she had cleared away the dinner-dishes, washed them, and put them in the closet,—an operation which the simplicity of the meal rendered but a short one,—Floy began to look round her, to see what else she could do. A desire seized her to explore the old house, of which so many rooms had for years remained deserted. They were bare and desolate, inhabited only by spiders and crickets, who occupied them rent free. It might have been years, perhaps, since they had echoed to the steps of a human foot. They looked dark and gloomy enough to have been witness to many a dark deed of midnight assassination. But it was all fancy, doubtless; and in little Floy they produced no other feeling than that of chilliness. She rummaged all the closets with a feeling of curiosity, but found nothing in any one of them to reward her search until she came to the last. There was a large roll of something on the floor, which, on examination, proved to be a small carpet, quite dirty, and somewhat moth-eaten. It had probably been left there inadvertently, and remained undiscovered until the present moment. Floy spread it out, and examined it critically. An idea struck her, which she hastened to put into execution. Threading her way back to the miser’s room, she procured a stout stick which stood in the corner, and, going back, gave the carpet a sound drubbing, which nearly stifled her with dust. Nevertheless, she persevered, and soon got it into quite a respectable state of cleanness. She then managed, by a considerable effort, to lug it to Martin’s room, and, in an hour or so, had spread it out, and finally fastened it by means of some tacks which she found in one corner of the closet. The effect was certainly wonderful. The carpet actually gave the room a very cosy and comfortable appearance; and little Floy took considerable credit to herself for the metamorphosis.  “What will he say?” thought she. “I wonder whether he will be pleased.”  It was but a few minutes after this change had been effected that Martin came in. It was about three o’clock,—sooner than Floy expected him; but he had thought she might require the materials early, in order to make preparations for the evening meal.  As he opened the door, he started back in surprise at the changed appearance of the room. It occurred to him, for a moment, that he had strayed into the wrong place; but the sight of Floy, sitting at the window, re-assured him, and he went in.  “What is all this?” he inquired in a bewildered tone.  Floy enjoyed his surprise. She told him in what manner she had effected the change, and asked him if he did not like it.  He could not do otherwise than answer in the affirmative; and, in truth, an unusual sense of comfort came over him as he sat down and looked about him.  Floy had taken possession of the flour, and was already kneading it.  “Now,” said she, after this was done, “I must put it down by the fire to rise; that will not take long; and then it will be ready to bake.”  “Have you got any shirts for me?” she inquired after a while.  “Yes,” said Martin, recollecting himself, and unrolling a bundle which he had placed on the table. “There are half a dozen for you to begin on; and, if you do them well, you can have some more.”  Floy looked pleased.  “Now,” said she, “I shall have something to do when you are away.”  “You like to be doing something?” said Martin, inquiringly.  “Oh, yes! I can’t bear to be idle.”  Martin did not go out again that afternoon. About six o’clock, Floy set the table, and placed upon it a plate of warm cakes which might have pleased the palate of an epicure. It was the best meal the miser had tasted for years, and he could not help confessing it to himself. Floy was gratified at the appetite with which he ate.  Thus matters went on. The presence of the little girl seemed to restore Martin to a part of his former self. He was no longer so grasping and miserly as before. Through little Floy’s ministry, he began to have more of a relish for the comforts of life, and less to grudge the expense necessary to obtain them.  It was not many weeks before he fell sick, in consequence of imprudent exposure to the rain. At first he did not regard it; but a fever set in, and he was confined to his bed.  At the urgent solicitation of Floy, he consented to have a physician called, though not without something of reluctance at the thought of the fee.  Then it was that he began to appreciate more fully the importance of Floy’s services. Ever ready to minister to his wants, no one could wish a more faithful or attentive nurse. As she sat by his bedside in the long days through which his sickness was protracted, busily engaged with her sewing, he would lie for hours, watching the motion of her busy fingers with pleased interest. Occasionally—for he had nothing else to do—his mind would wander back to the scenes of his early manhood, and he would sigh over the recollection of the happiness which might have been his. Then his thoughts would be borne along the dreamy years which had intervened, unlighted by the rays of friendship, and uncheered by the presence of affection. The image of his daughter, whom he had cast off, and of whose after-fate he knew nothing, came up before him, and he could not repel it. A change, a beneficial and salutary change, was rolling over his mind,—the fruit of those long involuntary hours of sickness and self-communing.  On the first day succeeding his recovery, he invited Floy to go out with him. It was an unusual request, and Floy hardly knew what to make of it. She got her bonnet, however (for shawl she had none), and complied. It was a chilly March day, and the thin dress which she had worn from the time of her coming to Kendrick’s was but an ill protection against the weather. She shivered involuntarily.  “You are cold,” said Martin; “but you will not need to go far.”  He led the way into a dry-goods store.  “Have you any warm shawls suitable for a little girl?” he inquired. He selected one, and paid for it. “Show me some dress-patterns,” he continued.  Two different ones were chosen. Martin paid for them.  “Can you direct me,” he inquired, “to any good dressmaker’s?”  The clerk had at first been inclined to laugh at the old man, whose attire, though warmer, was no better looking than Floy’s; but the promptness with which he paid for his purchases, and the glimpse which had in this way been obtained of a well-filled pocket-book, inspired him with a feeling of respect, and he readily complied with his request.  “Now,” said Martin cheerfully to Floy, “we will have you a little better dressed, so that you need not fear the cold.”  “I am sure,” said Floy, gratefully, “that I am much obliged, and I don’t know how I can repay you.”  “You have already,” said the old man with feeling. “I don’t know how I should have got along without you when I was sick.”  “Floy,” said Martin, thoughtfully, as they came out from the dressmaker’s, “although you have been with me for some time, I have never thought to ask your name,—I mean your other name besides Floy.”  “My name is not Floy,” said the child. “They only call me so. My real name is Florence,—Florence Eastman.”  “Florence Eastman!” said the old man, starting back in uncontrollable agitation. “Who was your mother? Tell me quick!”  “Her name,” said the child, somewhat surprised, “was Florence Kendrick.”  “Who was her father?”  “Martin Kendrick.”  “And where is he? Did you ever see him?”  “No,” said Floy, shaking her head. “He was angry with mother for marrying as she did, and would never see any of us.”  “And your mother?” said Martin, striving to be calm. “Is she dead?”  “Yes,” said Floy, sorrowfully. “First, my father died, and we were left very poor. Then mother was obliged to work very hard, sewing; and finally she took a fever, and died, leaving me alone in the world. For a week, I wandered about without a home; but at last you took me in. I don’t know what would have become of me if you had not,” said she, gratefully.  “Floy,” said Martin, looking at her steadfastly, “do you know my name?”  “No,”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56222"],["title","Bertha's Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf (#3)"],["body"," said Floy. “I have often wondered what it was, but never liked to ask you.”  “Then,” said he, in an agitated tone, “you shall know now. I am Martin Kendrick, your GRANDFATHER!”  Floy was filled with amazement, but, after a moment, threw herself into his arms. “Will you forgive mother?” she asked.  “I will! I have! But, alas! she has much more to forgive me. Would that she were still alive!”  Every day, Martin Kendrick became more alive to the claims of affection. His miserly habits gave way, and he became more considerate in his dealings with his tenants. The old house, in which he lived so many years, was torn down; and he bought a neat cottage just out of the city, where he and Floy live happily together. Floy, who has been sent to school, exhibits uncommon talent, and is fitting for the station she will soon assume as the heiress of her grandfather.     MY CASTLE.       “I have a beautiful castle,       With towers and battlements fair;     And many a banner, with gay device,       Floats in the outer air.      “The walls are of solid silver;       The towers are of massive gold;     And the lights that stream from the windows       A royal scene unfold.      “Ah! could you but enter my castle,       With its pomp of regal sheen,     You would say that it far surpasses       The Palace of Aladeen;—      “Could you but enter as I do,       And pace through the vaulted hall,     And mark the stately columns,       And the pictures on the wall;—      “With the costly gems about them,       That send their light afar,     With a chaste and softened splendor,       Like the light of a distant star!”      “And where is this wonderful castle,       With its rich emblazonings,     Whose pomp so far surpasses       The homes of the greatest kings?”      “Come out with me at morning,       And lie in the meadow-grass,     And lift your eyes to the ether blue,       And you will see it pass.      “There! can you not see the battlements;       And the turrets stately and high,     Whose lofty summits are tipped with clouds,       And lost in the arching sky?”      “Dear friend, you are only dreaming;       Your castle so stately and fair     Is only a fanciful structure,—       A castle in the air.”      “Perchance you are right. I know not       If a phantom it may be;     But yet, in my inmost heart, I feel       That it lives, and lives for me;—      “For, when clouds and darkness are round me,       And my heart is heavy with care,     I steal me away from the noisy crowd,       To dwell in my castle fair.      “There are servants to do my bidding;       There are servants to heed my call;     And I, with a master’s air of pride,       May pace through the vaulted hall.      “And I envy not the monarchs       With cities under their sway;     For am I not, in my own right,       A monarch as proud as they?      “What matter, then, if to others       My castle a phantom may be,     Since I feel, in the depth of my own heart,       That it is not so to me?”     MISS HENDERSON’S THANKSGIVING DAY.   Thanksgiving Day dawned clearly and frostily upon the little village of Castleton Hollow. The stage which connected daily with the nearest railroad station (for as yet Castleton Hollow had not arrived at the dignity of one of its own) came fully freighted, both inside and out. There were children and children’s children, who, in the pursuit of fortune, had strayed away from the homes where they first saw the light; but who were now returning, to revive, around the old familiar hearth, the associations and recollections of their early days.  Great were the preparations among the housewives of Castleton Hollow. That must indeed be a poor household which, on this occasion, could not boast its turkey and plum-pudding,—those well-established dishes; not to mention its long rows of pies,—apple, mince, and pumpkin,—wherewith the Thanksgiving board is wont to be garnished.  But it is not of the households generally that I propose to speak. Let the reader accompany me, in imagination, to a rather prim-looking brick mansion, situated on the principal street, but at some distance back, being separated from it by a front yard. Between this yard and the fence ran a prim-looking hedge, of very formal cut, being cropped in the most careful manner, lest one twig should, by chance, have the presumption to grow higher than its kindred. It was a two-story house, containing in each story one room on either side of the front door; making, of course, four in all.  If we go in, we shall find the outward primness well supported by the appearance of things within. In the front parlor—we may peep through the door, but it would be high treason, in the present moistened state of our boots, to step within its sacred precincts—there are six high-backed chairs standing in state, two at each window. One can easily see, from the general arrangement of the furniture, that from romping children, unceremonious kittens, and unhallowed intruders generally, this room is most sacredly guarded.  Without speaking particularly of the other rooms,—which, though not furnished in so stately a manner, bear a family resemblance to “the best room,”—we will usher the reader into the opposite room, where he will find the owner and occupant of this prim-looking residence.  Courteous reader! Miss Hetty Henderson. Miss Hetty Henderson, let me make you acquainted with this lady (or gentleman), who is desirous of knowing you better.  Miss Hetty Henderson, with whom the reader has just passed through the ceremony of introduction, is a maiden of some thirty-five summers, attired in a sober-looking dress of irreproachable neatness, but most formal cut. She is the only occupant of the house, of which, likewise, she is proprietor. Her father, who was the village physician, died some ten years since; leaving to Hetty,—or perhaps I should give her full name, Henrietta,—his only child, the house in which he lived, and some four thousand dollars in bank-stock, on the income of which she lived very comfortably.  Somehow, Miss Hetty had never married; though, such is the mercenary nature of man, the rumor of her inheritance brought to her feet several suitors. But Miss Hetty had resolved never to marry,—at least, this was her invariable answer to matrimonial offers; and so, after a time, it came to be understood that she was fixed for life,—an old maid. What reasons impelled her to this course were not known; but possibly the reader will be furnished with a clew before he finishes this narrative.  Meanwhile, the invariable effect of a single and solitary life combined attended Hetty. She grew precise, prim, and methodical, to a painful degree. It would have been quite a relief if one could have detected a stray thread even upon her well-swept carpet; but such was never the case.  On this particular day,—this Thanksgiving Day of which we are speaking,—Miss Hetty had completed her culinary preparations; that is, she had stuffed her turkey and put it in the oven, and kneaded her pudding; for, though she knew that but one would be present at the dinner, her conscience would scarcely have acquitted her if she had not made all the preparations to which she had been accustomed on such occasions.  This done, she sat down to her knitting; casting a glance every now and then at the oven, to make sure that all was going on well. It was a quiet morning; and Miss Hetty’s thoughts kept time to the clicking of her knitting-needles.  “After all,” thought she, “it’s rather solitary taking dinner alone, and that on Thanksgiving Day. I remember, a long time ago, when my father and my brothers and sisters were living, what a merry time we used to have round the table. But they are all dead; and I—I alone—am left.”  Miss Hetty sighed; but, after a while, the recollections of those old times returned. She tried to shake them off; but they had a fascination about them, after all, and would not go at her bidding.  “There used to be another there,” thought she,—“Nick Anderson. He too, I fear, is dead.”  Hetty heaved a thoughtful sigh, and a faint color came into her cheeks. She had reason. This Nicholas Anderson had been a medical student, apprenticed to her father; or rather placed with him, to be prepared for his profession. He was perhaps a year older than Hetty, and had regarded her with more than ordinary warmth of affection. He had, in fact, proposed to her, and had been conditionally accepted on a year’s probation. The trouble was, he was a little disposed to be wild, and, being naturally of a lively and careless temperament, did not exercise sufficient discrimination in the choice of his associates. Hetty had loved him as warmly as one of her nature could love. She was not one who would be drawn away beyond the dictates of reason and judgment by the force of affection. Still, it was not without a feeling of deep sorrow,—deeper than her calm manner led him to suspect,—that, at the end of the year’s probation, she informed Anderson that the result of his trial was not favorable to his suit, and that henceforth he must give up all thoughts of her.  To his vehement asseverations, promises, and protestations, she returned the same steady and inflexible answer; and, at the close of the interview, he left her, quite as full of indignation against her as of grief for his rejection.  That night, his clothing was packed up, and lowered from the window; and, when the next morning dawned, it was found that he had left the house, never, as was intimated in a slight note pencilled and left on the table in his room, to return again.         *       *       *       *       *  While Miss Henderson’s mind was far back in the past, she had not observed the approach of a man, shabbily attired, accompanied by a little girl apparently some eight years of age. The man’s face bore the impress of many cares and hardships. The little girl was of delicate appearance; and an occasional shiver showed that her garments were too thin "]]]
