Now--\" she added--\"now I think I've discovered the reason why my friends are forever worrying about fire. No doubt when they give me such advice they have seen you prowling around my house with that light of yours; and they think that if you haven't already set my house on fire, you're just a-going to.\"  When Freddie Firefly saw that Mrs. Ladybug was making Benjamin Bat's mistake of thinking that his light could start a blaze, he had to smile.  \"Nonsense!\" he cried. \"I'm always very careful, Mrs. Ladybug, when I'm near your house. You know that I wouldn't want your charming children to burn up.\"  And now Mrs. Ladybug pointed her other knitting needle at Freddie.  \"Well, if you're not careless, you're silly, anyhow,\" she snapped. \"I wouldn't object so much to your light if only you'd put it to some good use. But as long as I've known you--and that's several weeks--I've never seen you do anything but caper about the meadow and dance.\" And then Mrs. Ladybug began to knit furiously, as if to show Freddie Firefly that she was never idle, even if she did spend a good deal of time away from home. \"Do you intend always to fritter your nights away as you do now?\" she inquired.  \"What else could I do? I should like to know--\" Freddie began.  \"Why not use your light in some kind of work?\" Mrs. Ladybug asked him.  \"What work, I should like to know--\" Freddie said. And since Mrs. Ladybug did not at once answer him, he added: \"I don't believe you can suggest anything--can you?\"  \"Oh, yes, I can!\" she declared quickly. \"I was thinking. That's why I didn't reply sooner. Probably you don't know that I have helped many youngsters to begin to work. For instance, it was I that told Daddy Longlegs to help Farmer Green with his harvesting.\" Little Mrs. Ladybug felt so proud of herself that she dropped a stitch without noticing it.  \"Daddy Longlegs! HE'S not young!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed.  \"Oh! yes, he is! He's not so old as you think,\" Mrs. Ladybug replied. \"He's just about your age. And if he can work, you certainly can.\"  \"But I didn't know that Daddy Longlegs was working for Farmer Green,\" Freddie Firefly said.  \"He tried to, one day. But the wind blew too hard. ... It wasn't really Daddy's fault,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained. \"And you ought not to attempt to work on windy nights, either,\" she went on. \"For your light might go out, and then there'd be a terrible accident.\"     XXI  ALL ABOUT TRAINS   \"What do you mean?\" Freddie Firefly asked little Mrs. Ladybug. \"What accident could happen if the wind blew out my light?\" And he laughed very hard, because he knew that no gale was strong enough even to dim his greenish-white gleams.  \"Why,\" replied Mrs. Ladybug, \"the train would strike you and be wrecked. You see,\" she continued, \"I have everything planned for you. You're going to spend your nights on the railroad tracks, signalling the trains.\"  Well, Freddie Firefly rather liked Mrs. Ladybug's idea. And though he knew that she was mistaken about some things, he began to think that perhaps she was quite wise, after all.  \"Aren't you afraid I might set fire to the trains?\" he inquired slyly.  \"No, indeed!\" she answered. \"You'd stop them, you know, before they ran over you.\"  \"But I don't know how to make a train stop,\" he objected. \"I've never worked on a railroad in all my life.\"  \"Why, it's simple enough,\" said little Mrs. Ladybug. \"When a train came along you would stand on the track right in front of it and wave your light.\" And while she smiled at Freddie Firefly as if to say, \"You see how easy it is,\" she dropped six more stitches out of her knitting--and never found them, either.  Freddie Firefly, however, did not smile at all. On the contrary, he looked somewhat worried.  \"Are you sure it's safe?\" he asked her. \"If the train failed to stop, with me on the track in front of it--\"  \"Don't worry about that!\" cried little Mrs. Ladybug. \"You'll never amount to anything if you worry. And if you don't wish to fritter away your time dancing in this meadow, you'll take my advice and begin to work at once.\"  \"I'll think about the matter,\" said Freddie Firefly. And then he added somewhat doubtfully: \"It's a long way to the railroad.\"  \"Pooh!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed. \"Old Mr. Crow often visits it. And if he can fly that far, at his age, a youngster like you ought not to mind the trip.\"  \"Perhaps you know best,\" Freddie Firefly told Mrs. Ladybug at last. \"I'll take your advice just this once, and I'll see how I like the work. But there's another question I'd like to ask you: What will the trains do after they stop?\"  While laughing over Freddie's question Mrs. Ladybug shook so hard that she unravelled sixteen rows of her knitting before she could stop.  \"Bless you!\" she cried, as soon as she could speak. \"I don't know what the trains will do. That's their affair--not yours nor mine. Everybody's aware that trains are made for two purposes--to start and to stop. But I never should think of being so rude as to ask them WHY, or WHAT, or WHEN, or WHERE.\"  So Freddie Firefly thanked Mrs. Ladybug most politely. He was sure, now, that she was one of the wisest persons in the whole valley. No doubt, he thought, she knew almost as much as old Mr. Crow, or even Solomon Owl. And he wished he knew half what she did.  \"I'll start for the railroad track at once,\" Freddie told Mrs. Ladybug. And waving his cap at her, while she waved her knitting at him, he set forth towards the village, the lights of which twinkled dimly in the distance.     XXII  WORK ON THE RAILROAD   Freddie Firefly did not intend to go into the village itself. He expected to travel only as far as the railroad tracks, where they curved around a bend in the river before stretching straight away towards the town.  Though he spent a much longer time in making the journey than old Mr. Crow ever took, Freddie at last reached the railroad, where he promptly sat himself down between the rails to wait for a train. And there Freddie Firefly stayed all alone, in the dark, with nothing to keep from feeling forlorn except the croaking of a band of noisy frogs in a pool near-by.  After a while Freddie began to grow so weary of his new task that he wished he had never taken Mrs. Ladybug's advice.  \"I don't believe I like working,\" he said with a sigh, as he thought of the good time his family was having at that very moment, dancing in Farmer Green's meadow.  And then all at once he heard a faint whistle, far off down the valley. And a little later a low rumble caught his ear--a rumble which grew louder and louder until at last it turned into a roar, just as a stream of light shot around the curve in the track ahead of him, which followed the bend of the river.  Freddie Firefly was startled. He couldn't think what made that long lane of light. And he was about to jump into the bushes and hide when he saw all at once that it was exactly what he had been waiting for.  \"It's a train!\" he cried aloud. And he began flashing his light bravely while he swayed from side to side, for Mrs. Ladybug had told him that he must swing his light--if he expected to stop the train.  And all the while the train tore on towards Freddie Firefly. To his great surprise it showed not the slightest sign of stopping. And in spite of what Mrs. Ladybug had said, Freddie Firefly began to be afraid that it wasn't going to pause at all.  He soon saw that if he did not do something quickly the train would run over him. But by the time he had made up his mind to jump off the track, out of harm's way, it was too late for him to escape in that fashion.  So Freddie Firefly crawled hurriedly into a chink beneath the railroad tie on which he had been sitting. And with a horrible scream the train thundered over him. To Freddie's dismay it paid no heed to his flashing light, though he thought it must surely have seen that signal.  Those were terrible moments for Freddie Firefly, while the train was passing above him. The frightful noise, the trembling of the ground, the rush of the air--all those things made him wonder whether he could ever reach home again, alive and unharmed. He was even more scared than he had been when he found himself in the power of that dreadful creature, Jennie Junebug.     XXIII  WHY FREDDIE WAS GLAD   Even after the train had rushed shrieking into the village two miles away, and the echoes had grown still, Freddie Firefly cowered in his hiding-place on the railroad track, crouched in the chink beneath one of the ties.  At last he crept out, trembling in every limb. But in spite of his terror he skipped off the track very spryly.  Safe at one side of the rails, which gleamed in the moonlight, Freddie felt himself all over, to make sure that he had broken no bones.  \"I seem to be unhurt,\" he mused. \"But never, never again will I listen to anything that Mrs. Ladybug says.\"  And having made himself that solemn promise, he hurried away toward Farmer Green's meadow, which he reached just before dawn.  As he crossed the fields he thought that he smelled smoke. But he couldn't see a blaze anywhere. And when he came to the meadow he was so eager to dance that he forgot to ask anybody if there had been a fire.  Luckily he arrived in time to take part in the last dance of the night. And after the dance was over he astonished all his family with the strange tale that he told them.  Before going to their homes all Freddie's relations gathered around him to listen to his story of the night's adventure. And there were many \"Ohs\" and \"Ahs\" when he reached the point where the train ran over him.  \"You're lucky you didn't have a leg cut off,\" his favorite cousin remarked, \"though that wouldn't have been so bad as losing a wing.\"  Freddie Firefly shuddered.  \"Anyway, you're better off than Mrs. Ladybug is,\" somebody piped up.  \"Why, what's happened to her?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5727"],["title","The Tale of Freddie Firefly (#7)"],["body"," Firefly inquired.  \"Haven't you heard?\" several of his cousins cried.  \"No! no!\" he shouted.  \"Her house caught fire to-night, while she was away from home,\" they explained.  \"I thought I smelled smoke as I was coming back from the railroad,\" Freddie observed. And then a sad picture came into his mind.  \"And Mrs. Lady bug's children--\" he began breathlessly.  \"Oh! The neighbors saved them,\" his favorite cousin said. \"They're only slightly scorched. But their ma's house is ruined.\"  Then, to everybody's great surprise, Freddie Firefly began to dance up and down and sing with joy.  \"Oh, I'm so glad! Oh, I'm so glad!\" he chanted over and over again.  His relations could scarcely believe that he was quite himself.  \"His fright on the railroad must have injured his mind,\" they said to one another. \"Or perhaps the train ran over his head when he didn't know it.\" They could think of no other reason for Freddie's queer actions. Always before he had seemed too kind-hearted to rejoice over another person's ill luck.  \"What do you mean?\" three hundred voices shouted. \"Why are you glad?\"  \"I'm glad I tried to stop the train,\" Freddie Firefly answered, \"because now Mrs. Ladybug can't say that I set her house on fire. She knows that I was working on the railroad to-night. And nobody can be in two places at the same time.\"  THE END."]]]
