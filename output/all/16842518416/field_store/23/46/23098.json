They swear in brokers and other officers, and investigate the validity of claims to civic freedom.  For the proper discharge of these and similar duties, they are singularly adapted through their local knowledge, which is likewise of material service to her Majesty's judges at the Central Criminal Court.  This circumstance further renders them most efficient as city magistrates,--far more so, indeed, than any police or stipendiary magistrate could ever hope to be. Personally acquainted with the inhabitants of their respective wards, they are in a position to obtain peculiar and authentic information as to the characters, habits, and motives of witnesses, accusers, and accused.  Their devotion to public business is wholly disinterested, for there are no pecuniary emoluments attached to the office, which has truly little to recommend it, save as being a sphere of active utility, and as a gratifying token of the good-will of one's fellow-citizens.  The proper style of the Court is the \"Court of the Mayor and Aldermen in the Inner Chamber.\" It consists of the Lord Mayor or his deputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--and not less than twelve other aldermen.  The proceedings of the Court are entered in journals called \"Repertories,\" which are kept in the muniment-room.  The Recorder, the Steward of Southwark, the Clerk to the Lord Mayor, the keepers, governors, chaplains, and surgeons of the different prisons, and other officers of the Corporation, are elected by this Court, which, for assiduity, intelligence, and incorruptibility, yields to no body of men in the kingdom.  Court of Common Council.  But however distinguished may be the civic position, however great the moral influence, of the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen, the controlling power is, after all, centred in the Common Council.  At a very remote period the freemen of the City were accustomed to meet in general assembly, and to act as one body.  As their numbers increased, the many inconveniences of such a mode of proceeding soon became manifest; and so early as the reign of the first Edward representatives began to be chosen from each ward for the despatch of real business.  At first the guilds, or trading companies, claimed the right of election as their exclusive privilege, and consequently excited the jealousy of the mass of the inhabitants.  It was therefore arranged that the men of each guild or \"mystery\" should choose their own delegates from among themselves, and this was the more easily accomplished, as at that time each craft occupied a separate quarter, as is still the custom in the East.  This arrangement, however, was of brief duration, and a more permanent settlement was effected in the reign of Richard II.  It was then agreed that every ward should annually elect four of the most efficient persons in the ward to sit in the Common Council for the following year, and whose names should be presented to the mayor --that high functionary being charged to accept no more than eight members of any one \"mystery\" for the whole city.  As the wards varied in extent and population, it was further agreed that the larger wards should return six councillors, and the smaller four or two, according to their sufficiency.  The number of the Common Council was then fixed at 96 members, but gradually increased to the present number of 206, who are chosen as follows:-  Bassishaw and Lime Street each return 4; Dowgate, Candlewick, Cordwainers, Cornhill, Queenhithe, Vintry, and Walbrook, 6; Bread Street, Bridge, Billingsgate, Broad Street, Cheap, Coleman Street, Cripplegate Within, and Cripplegate Without, Tower, Langbourn, Castle Baynard, Aldersgate, Aldgate, and Portsoken, 8; Bishopsgate and Farringdon-within, 14; and Farringdon-without, 16.  These true representatives of the citizens constitute the Court of Common Council, under the style and title of \"Court of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commoners of the City of London in Common Council assembled.\" It requires the presence of the Lord Mayor, or his deputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--two aldermen and thirty-eight common councilmen, to make a quorum.  There are usually twelve ordinary meetings in the year, and on an average thirteen extraordinary meetings, convened for special purposes by a requisition to the Lord Mayor signed by seven members.  The proceedings are conducted as nearly as possible according to the routine of the House of Commons, and embrace a vast variety of subjects of local and sometimes national importance.  The Court has a double function --legislative and executive.  In the former capacity it enacts by-laws for the better government of the Corporation, in conformity with immemorial usage confirmed by 15 Edward III., and again more recently and fully by the Municipal Corporations Act.  The charter of Edward III. authorizes the mayor and aldermen, with the assent of the commonalty, \"where any customs theretofore used and obtained proved hard or defective, or any matters newly arising within the City needed amendment, and no remedy had been previously provided, to apply and ordain a convenient remedy, as often as it should seem expedient; so that the same were agreeable to good faith and reason, for the common advantage of the citizens, and other liege subjects sojourning with them, and useful to king and people.\" Vested with such powers as these, the Corporation of London are clearly competent to introduce whatever reforms circumstances may render desirable.  As practical men of business, the Court of Common Council may fairly be supposed to be the best judges as to the nature of the amendments to be made, and the right time of making them.  Persons engaged in commercial pursuits are not usually obstructive, or opposed to useful innovations.  On the contrary, being wedded to no theories, they are constantly impelled to change, and to act upon each emergency as it arises.  The past history of the City of London is one long illustration of this position,--it is an uninterrupted series of reforms, many of them rather beneficial to the nation at large than to the Corporation itself.  On what grounds, then, is it justifiable to supersede this salutary internal action of the Corporation, and to exercise the arbitrary power of the legislature to enforce crude and inapplicable innovations? This interference with the self-government of the City is, in fact, a vote of censure on the duly elected representatives of the citizens, with whom the majority of the citizens themselves are, however, perfectly satisfied.  But, in truth, that \"self-government\" is the head and front of their offence, for is it not a stumbling-block to ministerial and oligarchical influence?  In addition to the power of enacting by-laws, the Common Council superintend the disposal of the funds of the Corporation; and without their previous consent no larger sum than 100 pounds can be paid for any purpose whatsoever. Their executive functions are also considerable.  Upon this court depends the responsibility of electing the common serjeant, the town clerk, the two judges, and officers of the Sheriffs' Court, the clerk of the peace, the coroner, the remembrancer, the commissioner of the city police, and various other officers of inferior note and standing.  The Citizens.  The \"complete\" citizen may be defined as a ten-pound householder, paying scot and bearing lot.  The freedom of the City is not, however, attainable by simple residence.  It is to be acquired only by three modes--by patrimony, by apprenticeship, or by redemption.  A royal charter, even, is insufficient to make the grantee free of the City. The freedom of the City is not confined to the male sex.  Freewomen are called free sisters, but cannot transmit their freedom, which is, moreover, suspended during coverture.  Freedom by service is acquired by a seven years' apprenticeship to a freeman or freewoman, the indenture being enrolled at the Chamberlain's office within twelve months of its execution.  The apprentice need not necessarily be articled to a member of any guild, fraternity, or trading company, but he must not be the son of an alien.  Freedom by redemption, or purchase, is of a threefold nature:--1st.  It may take the form of a fine for any breach of the apprenticeship indentures; 2nd.  It is often bestowed as an honorary distinction on individuals eminent for their public services; and 3rd.  Admission to the freedom of the City is by presentment by persons entitled to confer that privilege.  It is imperative on all persons elected to a corporate office, or \"occupying premises and carrying on any trade, business, or profession, within the City and its liberties,\" to become free of the City.  This is done by the payment of the fees of the officers and of 5 pounds to the Corporation.  The advantages of the freedom, though not so great in the present day as in ancient times, are still considerable.  Besides being a bond of union and mutual protection, it entitles its possessor to a vote at the elections of the aldermen and the common council of the ward.  Only freemen can act as brokers, or, indeed, carry on any trade within the boundaries of the City.  The Companies.  As the City of London waxed mighty and opulent, proportionate was the increase of the wealth and importance of its component parts.  The humble guilds or crafts gradually developed themselves into large and influential trading companies, to belong to which was deemed an honour not beneath the consideration of royalty.  Edward III., for instance, did not disdain to be enrolled in the Worshipful Company of Linen Armourers, now Merchant Tailors; and his example was followed by his successor, Richard II. The example, indeed, was contagious, for in the reign of the latter monarch the company in question could boast of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5609"],["title","The Corporation of London, Its Rights and Privileges (#5)"],["body","fellowship of four royal dukes, ten earls, ten barons, and five bishops.  The custom has come down to our own times, and the proudest names in the aristocracy are recorded in the books of the City companies.  The presidents of these crafts or mysteries were styled Wardens, who were assisted by a small number of delegates of the guild in presenting to the City Chamberlain all defaults against the rules and ordinances of the mystery.  These companies were not all equally regarded by either the sovereign or the citizens.  Towards the close of the reign of Edward II. the more important companies separated from the less wealthy; and this distinction was soon so far recognized, that precedency was given to the following twelve companies:- 1. Mercers; 2.  Grocers; 3.  Drapers; 4.  Fishmongers; 5.  Goldsmiths; 6. Skinners; 7.  Merchant Tailors; 8.  Haberdashers; 9.  Salters; 10. Ironmongers; 11.  Vintners; 12.  Cloth workers.  In these companies the freemen from early times have been of two classes; the upper, entitled to wear the \"livery\" or uniform of the company; and the lower, consisting mostly of workmen.  The representatives of the companies were chosen from the former, and are mentioned in the charters as probi homines.  In the fifteenth year of Edward IV. the Common Council enacted, that the masters, wardens, and probi homines of the several mysteries should repair to the Guildhall in their last liveries, for the purpose of electing the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and other civic officers; and that the members of the Common Council should be the only other persons present.  This court now consists of the Lord Mayor or his deputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--four aldermen, and the liverymen of the companies who are also freemen.  Their office is to elect the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, chamberlain, bridge-master, and auditors of the City and Bridge-house accounts, and the four ale-conners. The official style of the court is, \"A Meeting or Assembly of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Liverymen of the several Companies of the City of London in Common Hall assembled.\" The franchise is confined to liverymen of a year's standing, who have paid their livery fines in full, without receiving any drawback or allowance.  The mode of proceeding is by a show of hands, but a poll may be demanded by any of the candidates, or by two electors.  The Sheriffs.  The office of Sheriff has somewhat fallen from its ancient \"high estate.\" According to Stow, they were formerly \"the mayor's eyes, seeing and supporting part of the case, which the person of the mayor is not alone sufficient to bear.\" In olden times the sheriffs were always conjoined with the mayor and aldermen in proclamations requiring them to preserve the peace of the City.  From a very remote period the right of electing these officers belonged to the citizens, and later charters acknowledge and confirm the privilege.  Henry I. granted to them to hold Middlesex to farm, for 300 pounds a year, and to appoint their own sheriff; while the second charter of John confirms to them the sheriffwick of London and Middlesex at the rent or farm of 300 pounds, \"blank sterling money,\" and declares that they \"shall make amongst themselves sheriffs whom they will, and remove them when they will.\" In those times this was a very important privilege, for the sheriff, or shire-reve, as the king's bailiff, was possessed of extraordinary powers, which he usually exercised in a very corrupt and oppressive manner.  The sheriffs of London are the sheriff of Middlesex; in the former capacity they are addressed in the plural, in the latter in the singular.  Though shorn of its beams, the office of Sheriff is still a highly honourable one, nor are the duties light or unimportant which devolve upon these functionaries.  The honour, moreover, is as costly as it is onerous; not only do the sheriffs receive no salary, but they are conventionally expected to disburse several thousand pounds in charities and hospitality.  The inspection of the city gaols occupies no small portion of their time, nor do they enjoy much intermission from the incessant demands for eleemosynary aid.  That an office so costly and troublesome should be an object of competition, is certainly a striking proof of the disinterested and patriotic spirit of the citizens of London.  The Law Courts.  With characteristic love of fair play, our ancestors laid it down as a leading principle, that \"justice should be administered at every man's own door, in the presence of his neighbours.\" It is, indeed, a primary element of good government, that the dispensation of justice should be prompt and inexpensive, and without favour of persons.  With the exception of the City of London, however, and a few other privileged places, the local tribunals were gradually superseded through the centralizing action of the superior courts.  But even in London the civic franchises have been seriously diminished through the ruling of those courts that the privilege claimed by the citizens to be sued only before their own local tribunals is confined to real, and does not extend to transitory actions.  The highest court of civic judicature was the Hustings Court, so called from the Saxon word hustings, signifying the \"house of things,\" or causes.  It was presided over by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, but the proceedings were actually conducted, and judgment pronounced, by the Recorder.  All real and mixed cases, saving ejectment, fell within the province of this court, which was held at Guildhall on every alternate Tuesday.  This court, however, though not formally abolished, does not now sit, and all the business formerly transacted at it is transferred to the Lord Mayor Court and the City Small Debts Court. In ancient times, the registration of deeds, wills, and titles to land, belonged also to this court, and the record in the Hustings of a sale or purchase of lands was deemed a sufficient voucher.  It has been suggested that, as the necessity of a proper system of registration of the sale or mortgage of real property is becoming daily more evident, the machinery for accomplishing that purpose is afforded by the Court of Hustings, so far, at least, as the City is concerned.  Practically, the most important court, however, at the present day, is the Lord Mayor's Court, or Court of Aldermen of the Outer Chamber.  As in the Hustings Court, the actual judge is the Recorder, though the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are supposed to preside.  In some respects, this court is one of equity, with the advantage over the Court of Chancery of being at the same time more expeditious, quite as equitable, and far less expensive.  As a court of common law, it takes cognizance of all personal and mixed actions, without exception, and in its operations and bearings is altogether a striking example of the benefits incidental to local self-government.  The Sheriffs' Court of the City of London for the recovery of small debts is also admirably adapted to the requirements of a free commercial people, and is of inestimable value to the small tradesmen of London.  Public Charities.  The monastic institutions in Roman Catholic countries provide for, and thereby foster, a large amount of idle and reckless habits.  Previous to the Reformation, this was certainly the case in England.  Not only the sick, the maimed, and the accidentally necessitous were fed and clothed,--the same indiscriminating charity was extended to those far less worthy of the sympathy of their fellow-creatures.  On the suppression of conventual establishments, it would have fared badly with the deserving poor in London had not the Corporation stepped forward to help them.  At present, the princely sum of 10,000 pounds is annually disbursed from the corporate funds in contributions to various hospitals, asylums, schools, dispensaries, and local charities; but even this large sum of money would be inadequate to the purpose, were it not supplemented by the individual munificence of the citizens.  The Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, the Aldermen, and the other civic dignitaries vie with one another in an open-handed liberality, which asks no other condition than that the recipient shall actually stand in need of aid, and be worthy of relief and assistance.  It is much to be feared, however, that with the declining influence of the Corporation, the stream of private charity will also dry up. The continued payment of the 10,000 pounds a year may, indeed, be secured by Act of Parliament; but no Act of Parliament can alter human nature.  Proud of their position as the chosen delegates and representatives of their fellow-citizens, among whom they and their fathers have lived for generations, the City potentates have, of their abundance, contributed lavishly and without stint to every local institution deserving of sympathy and support.  And not only these, but the livery companies likewise have given lordly amounts to charitable establishments both within and without the City liberties, and have founded schools in many distant parts of the kingdom. But if the Corporation is to be \"reformed\" after the manner of Sir George Grey and his coadjutors--if the esprit de corps, which is now so beneficially and beneficently exhibited, is to be suppressed, what reasonable hope remains that men who have been arbitrarily deprived of all real interest in City matters will still devote their time, their energies, and their fortunes to purposes which only remunerate them with toil, anxiety, and personal discomfort? The inevitable tendency of the proposed Bill is to reduce the entire administration of the City to a dull, heartless routine.  Step by step the continental system of home government is being insinuated into this hitherto free country. Yet a few years of unchecked progress in that direction, and it will be proposed to appoint crown officers to preside over county and town, city and borough.
