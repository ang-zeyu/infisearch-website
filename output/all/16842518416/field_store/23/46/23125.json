Give back our land and our country, give back our     herds of game; Give back the furs and the forests that were ours     before you came; Give back the peace and the plenty. Then come     with your new belief, And blame, if you dare, the hunger that _drove_ him to     be a thief.\"    A CRY FROM AN INDIAN WIFE   My forest brave, my Red-skin love, farewell; We may not meet to-morrow; who can tell What mighty ills befall our little band, Or what you'll suffer from the white man's hand? Here is your knife! I thought 'twas sheathed for aye. No roaming bison calls for it to-day; No hide of prairie cattle will it maim; The plains are bare, it seeks a nobler game: 'Twill drink the life-blood of a soldier host. Go; rise and strike, no matter what the cost. Yet stay. Revolt not at the Union Jack, Nor raise Thy hand against this stripling pack Of white-faced warriors, marching West to quell Our fallen tribe that rises to rebel. They all are young and beautiful and good; Curse to the war that drinks their harmless blood. Curse to the fate that brought them from the East To be our chiefs--to make our nation least That breathes the air of this vast continent. Still their new rule and council is well meant. They but forget we Indians owned the land From ocean unto ocean; that they stand Upon a soil that centuries agone Was our sole kingdom and our right alone. They never think how they would feel to-day, If some great nation came from far away, Wresting their country from their hapless braves, Giving what they gave us--but wars and graves. Then go and strike for liberty and life, And bring back honour to your Indian wife. Your wife? Ah, what of that, who cares for me? Who pities my poor love and agony? What white-robed priest prays for your safety here, As prayer is said for every volunteer That swells the ranks that Canada sends out? Who prays for vict'ry for the Indian scout? Who prays for our poor nation lying low? None--therefore take your tomahawk and go. My heart may break and burn into its core, But I am strong to bid you go to war. Yet stay, my heart is not the only one That grieves the loss of husband and of son; Think of the mothers o'er the inland seas; Think of the pale-faced maiden on her knees; One pleads her God to guard some sweet-faced child That marches on toward the North-West wild. The other prays to shield her love from harm, To strengthen his young, proud uplifted arm. Ah, how her white face quivers thus to think, _Your_ tomahawk his life's best blood will drink. She never thinks of my wild aching breast, Nor prays for your dark face and eagle crest Endangered by a thousand rifle balls, My heart the target if my warrior falls. O! coward self I hesitate no more; Go forth, and win the glories of the war. Go forth, nor bend to greed of white men's hands, By right, by birth we Indians own these lands, Though starved, crushed, plundered, lies our nation low... Perhaps the white man's God has willed it so.    DAWENDINE   There's a spirit on the river, there's a ghost upon the shore, They are chanting, they are singing through the starlight evermore, As they steal amid the silence,     And the shadows of the shore.  You can hear them when the Northern candles light the Northern sky, Those pale, uncertain candle flames, that shiver, dart and die, Those dead men's icy finger tips,     Athwart the Northern sky.  You can hear the ringing war-cry of a long-forgotten brave Echo through the midnight forest, echo o'er the midnight wave, And the Northern lanterns tremble     At the war-cry of that brave.  And you hear a voice responding, but in soft and tender song; It is Dawendine's spirit singing, singing all night long; And the whisper of the night wind     Bears afar her Spirit song.  And the wailing pine trees murmur with their voice attuned to hers, Murmur when they 'rouse from slumber as the night wind through them stirs; And you listen to their legend,     And their voices blend with hers.  There was feud and there was bloodshed near the river by the hill; And Dawendine listened, while her very heart stood still: Would her kinsman or her lover     Be the victim by the hill?  Who would be the great unconquered? who come boasting how he dealt Death? and show his rival's scalplock fresh and bleeding at his belt. Who would say, \"O Dawendine!     Look upon the death I dealt?\"  And she listens, listens, listens--till a war-cry rends the night, Cry of her victorious lover, monarch he of all the height; And his triumph wakes the horrors,     Kills the silence of the night.  Heart of her! it throbs so madly, then lies freezing in her breast, For the icy hand of death has chilled the brother she loved best; And her lover dealt the death-blow;     And her heart dies in her breast.  And she hears her mother saying, \"Take thy belt of wampum white; Go unto yon evil savage while he glories on the height; Sing and sue for peace between us:     At his feet lay wampum white.  \"Lest thy kinsmen all may perish, all thy brothers and thy sire Fall before his mighty hatred as the forest falls to fire; Take thy wampum pale and peaceful,     Save thy brothers, save thy sire.\"  And the girl arises softly, softly slips toward the shore; Loves she well the murdered brother, loves his hated foeman more, Loves, and longs to give the wampum;     And she meets him on the shore.  \"Peace,\" she sings, \"O mighty victor, Peace! I bring thee wampum white. Sheathe thy knife whose blade has tasted my young kinsman's blood to-night Ere it drink to slake its thirsting,     I have brought thee wampum white.\"  Answers he, \"O Dawendine! I will let thy kinsmen be, I accept thy belt of wampum; but my hate demands for me That they give their fairest treasure,     Ere I let thy kinsmen be.  \"Dawendine, for thy singing, for thy suing, war shall cease; For thy name, which speaks of dawning, _Thou_ shalt be the dawn of peace; For thine eyes whose purple shadows tell of dawn,     My hate shall cease.  \"Dawendine, Child of Dawning, hateful are thy kin to me; Red my fingers with their heart blood, but my heart is red for thee: Dawendine, Child of Dawning,     Wilt thou fail or follow me?\"  And her kinsmen still are waiting her returning from the night, Waiting, waiting for her coming with her belt of wampum white; But forgetting all, she follows,     Where he leads through day or night.  There's a spirit on the river, there's a ghost upon the shore, And they sing of love and loving through the starlight evermore, As they steal amid the silence,     And the shadows of the shore.    WOLVERINE   \"Yes, sir, it's quite a story, though you won't believe it's true, But such things happened often when I lived beyond the Soo.\" And the trapper tilted back his chair and filled his pipe anew.  \"I ain't thought of it neither fer this many 'n many a day, Although it used to haunt me in the years that's slid away, The years I spent a-trappin' for the good old Hudson's Bay.  \"Wild? You bet, 'twas wild then, an' few an' far between The squatters' shacks, for whites was scarce as furs when things is green, An' only reds an' 'Hudson's' men was all the folk I seen.  \"No. Them old Indyans ain't so bad, not if you treat 'em square. Why, I lived in amongst 'em all the winters I was there, An' I never lost a copper, an' I never lost a hair.  \"But I'd have lost my life the time that you've heard tell about; I don't think I'd be settin' here, but dead beyond a doubt, If that there Indyan 'Wolverine' jest hadn't helped me out.  \"'Twas freshet time, 'way back, as long as sixty-six or eight, An' I was comin' to the Post that year a kind of late, For beaver had been plentiful, and trappin' had been great.  \"One day I had been settin' traps along a bit of wood, An' night was catchin' up to me jest faster 'an it should, When all at once I heard a sound that curdled up my blood.  \"It was the howl of famished wolves--I didn't stop to think But jest lit out across for home as quick as you could wink, But when I reached the river's edge I brought up at the brink.  \"That mornin' I had crossed the stream straight on a sheet of ice An' now, God help me! There it was, churned up an' cracked to dice, The flood went boiling past--I stood like one shut in a vice.  \"No way ahead, no path aback, trapped like a rat ashore, With naught but death to follow, and with naught but death afore; The howl of hungry wolves aback--ahead, the torrent's roar.  \"An' then--a voice, an Indyan voice, that called out clear and clean, 'Take Indyan's horse, I run like deer, wolf can't catch Wolverine.' I says, 'Thank Heaven.' There stood the chief I'd nicknamed Wolverine.  \"I leapt on that there horse, an' then jest like a coward fled, An' left that Indyan standin' there alone, as good as dead, With the wolves a-howlin' at his back, the swollen stream ahead.  \"I don't know how them Indyans dodge from death the way they do, You won't believe it, sir, but what I'm tellin' you is true, But that there chap was 'round next day as sound as me or you.  \"He came to get his horse, but not a cent he'd take from me. Yes, sir, you're right, the Indyans now ain't like they used to be; We've got 'em sharpened up a bit an' _now_ they'll take a fee.  \"No, sir, you're wrong, they ain't no 'dogs.' I'm not through tellin' yet; You'll take that name right back again, or else jest out you get! You'll take that name right back when you hear all this yarn, I bet.  \"It happened that same autumn, when some Whites was comin' in, I heard the old Red River carts a-kickin' up a din, So I went over to their camp to see an English skin.  \"They said, 'They'd had an awful scare from Injuns,' an' they swore That savages had come around the very night before A-brandishing their tomahawks an' painted up for war.  \"But when their plucky Englishmen had put a bit of lead Right through the heart of one of them, an' rolled him over, dead, The other cowards said that they had come on peace instead.  \"'That "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5625"],["title","Flint and Feather: Collected Verse (#5)"],["body","(the Whites) had lost some stores, from off their little pack, An' that the Red they peppered dead had followed up their track, Because he'd found the packages an' came _to give them back_.'  \"'Oh!' they said, 'they were quite sorry, but it wasn't like as if They had killed a decent Whiteman by mistake or in a tiff, It was only some old Injun dog that lay there stark an' stiff.'  \"I said, 'You are the meanest dogs that ever yet I seen,' Then I rolled the body over as it lay out on the green; I peered into the face--My God! 'twas poor old Wolverine.\"    THE VAGABONDS   What saw you in your flight to-day, Crows, awinging your homeward way?  Went you far in carrion quest, Crows, that worry the sunless west?  Thieves and villains, you shameless things! Black your record as black your wings.  Tell me, birds of the inky hue, Plunderous rogues--to-day have you  Seen with mischievous, prying eyes Lands where earlier suns arise?  Saw you a lazy beck between Trees that shadow its breast in green,  Teased by obstinate stones that lie Crossing the current tauntingly?  Fields abloom on the farther side With purpling clover lying wide--  Saw you there as you circled by, Vale-environed a cottage lie,  Girt about with emerald bands, Nestling down in its meadow lands?  Saw you this on your thieving raids? Speak--you rascally renegades!  Thieved you also away from me Olden scenes that I long to see?  If, O! crows, you have flown since morn Over the place where I was born,  Forget will I, how black you were Since dawn, in feather and character;  Absolve will I, your vagrant band Ere you enter your slumberland.    THE SONG MY PADDLE SINGS   West wind, blow from your prairie nest, Blow from the mountains, blow from the west. The sail is idle, the sailor too; O! wind of the west, we wait for you. Blow, blow! I have wooed you so, But never a favour you bestow. You rock your cradle the hills between, But scorn to notice my white lateen.  I stow the sail, unship the mast: I wooed you long but my wooing's past; My paddle will lull you into rest. O! drowsy wind of the drowsy west, Sleep, sleep, By your mountain steep, Or down where the prairie grasses sweep! Now fold in slumber your laggard wings, For soft is the song my paddle sings.  August is laughing across the sky, Laughing while paddle, canoe and I, Drift, drift, Where the hills uplift On either side of the current swift.  The river rolls in its rocky bed; My paddle is plying its way ahead; Dip, dip, While the waters flip In foam as over their breast we slip.  And oh, the river runs swifter now; The eddies circle about my bow. Swirl, swirl! How the ripples curl In many a dangerous pool awhirl!  And forward far the rapids roar, Fretting their margin for evermore. Dash, dash, With a mighty crash, They seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.  Be strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe! The reckless waves you must plunge into. Reel, reel. On your trembling keel, But never a fear my craft will feel.  We've raced the rapid, we're far ahead! The river slips through its silent bed. Sway, sway, As the bubbles spray And fall in tinkling tunes away.  And up on the hills against the sky, A fir tree rocking its lullaby, Swings, swings, Its emerald wings, Swelling the song that my paddle sings.    THE CAMPER   Night 'neath the northern skies, lone, black, and grim: Naught but the starlight lies 'twixt heaven, and him.  Of man no need has he, of God, no prayer; He and his Deity are brothers there.  Above his bivouac the firs fling down Through branches gaunt and black, their needles brown.  Afar some mountain streams, rockbound and fleet, Sing themselves through his dreams in cadence sweet,  The pine trees whispering, the heron's cry, The plover's passing wing, his lullaby.  And blinking overhead the white stars keep Watch o'er his hemlock bed--his sinless sleep.    AT HUSKING TIME   At husking time the tassel fades To brown above the yellow blades,   Whose rustling sheath enswathes the corn   That bursts its chrysalis in scorn Longer to lie in prison shades.  Among the merry lads and maids The creaking ox-cart slowly wades Twixt stalks and stubble, sacked and torn At husking time.  The prying pilot crow persuades The flock to join in thieving raids; The sly racoon with craft inborn His portion steals; from plenty's horn His pouch the saucy chipmunk lades At husking time.    WORKWORN   Across the street, an humble woman lives; To her 'tis little fortune ever gives; Denied the wines of life, it puzzles me To know how she can laugh so cheerily. This morn I listened to her softly sing, And, marvelling what this effect could bring I looked: 'twas but the presence of a child Who passed her gate, and looking in, had smiled. But self-encrusted, I had failed to see The child had also looked and laughed to me. My lowly neighbour thought the smile God-sent, And singing, through the toilsome hours she went. O! weary singer, I have learned the wrong Of taking gifts, and giving naught of song; I thought my blessings scant, my mercies few, Till I contrasted them with yours, and you; To-day I counted much, yet wished it more-- While but a child's bright smile was all your store,  If I had thought of all the stormy days, That fill some lives that tread less favoured ways, How little sunshine through their shadows gleamed, My own dull life had much the brighter seemed; If I had thought of all the eyes that weep Through desolation, and still smiling keep, That see so little pleasure, so much woe, My own had laughed more often long ago; If I had thought how leaden was the weight Adversity lays at my kinsman's gate, Of that great cross my next door neighbour bears, My thanks had been more frequent in my prayers; If I had watched the woman o'er the way, Workworn and old, who labours day by day, Who has no rest, no joy to call her own, My tasks, my heart, had much the lighter grown.    EASTER   April 1, 1888  Lent gathers up her cloak of sombre shading   In her reluctant hands. Her beauty heightens, fairest in its fading,   As pensively she stands Awaiting Easter's benediction falling,   Like silver stars at night, Before she can obey the summons calling   Her to her upward flight, Awaiting Easter's wings that she must borrow   Ere she can hope to fly-- Those glorious wings that we shall see to-morrow   Against the far, blue sky. Has not the purple of her vesture's lining   Brought calm and rest to all? Has her dark robe had naught of golden shining   Been naught but pleasure's pall? Who knows? Perhaps when to the world returning   In youth's light joyousness, We'll wear some rarer jewels we found burning   In Lent's black-bordered dress. So hand in hand with fitful March she lingers   To beg the crowning grace Of lifting with her pure and holy fingers   The veil from April's face. Sweet, rosy April--laughing, sighing, waiting   Until the gateway swings, And she and Lent can kiss between the grating   Of Easter's tissue wings. Too brief the bliss--the parting comes with sorrow.   Good-bye dear Lent, good-bye! We'll watch your fading wings outlined to-morrow   Against the far blue sky.    ERIE WATERS   A dash of yellow sand, Wind-scattered and sun-tanned; Some waves that curl and cream along the margin of the strand; And, creeping close to these Long shores that lounge at ease, Old Erie rocks and ripples to a fresh sou'-western breeze.  A sky of blue and grey; Some stormy clouds that play At scurrying up with ragged edge, then laughing blow away, Just leaving in their trail Some snatches of a gale; To whistling summer winds we lift a single daring sail.  O! wind so sweet and swift, O! danger-freighted gift Bestowed on Erie with her waves that foam and fall and lift, We laugh in your wild face, And break into a race With flying clouds and tossing gulls that weave and interlace.    THE FLIGHT OF THE CROWS   The autumn afternoon is dying o'er   The quiet western valley where I lie Beneath the maples on the river shore,   Where tinted leaves, blue waters and fair sky   Environ all; and far above some birds are flying by  To seek their evening haven in the breast   And calm embrace of silence, while they sing Te Deums to the night, invoking rest   For busy chirping voice and tired wing--   And in the hush of sleeping trees their sleeping cradles swing.  In forest arms the night will soonest creep,   Where sombre pines a lullaby intone, Where Nature's children curl themselves to sleep,   And all is still at last, save where alone   A band of black, belated crows arrive from lands unknown.  Strange sojourn has been theirs since waking day,   Strange sights and cities in their wanderings blend With fields of yellow maize, and leagues away   With rivers where their sweeping waters wend   Past velvet banks to rocky shores, in canyons bold to end.  O'er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead,   Till lashed to life by storm-clouds, have they flown? In what wild lands, in laggard flight have led   Their aerial career unseen, unknown,   'Till now with twilight come their cries in lonely monotone?  The flapping of their pinions in the air   Dies in the hush of distance, while they light Within the fir tops, weirdly black and bare,   That stand with giant strength and peerless height,   To shelter fairy, bird and beast throughout the closing night.  Strange black and princely pirates of the skies,   Would that your wind-tossed travels I could know! Would that my soul could see, and, seeing, rise   To unrestricted life where ebb and flow   Of Nature's pulse would constitute a wider life below!  Could I but live just here in Freedom's arms,   A kingly life without a sovereign's care! Vain dreams! Day hides with closing wings her charms,   And all is cradled in repose, save where   Yon band of black, belated crows still frets the evening air.    MOONSET   Idles the night wind through the dreaming firs, That waking murmur low, As some lost melody returning stirs The love of long ago; And through the far, cool distance, zephyr"]]]
