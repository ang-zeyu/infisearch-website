I am willing that Guy should enjoy as many privileges as I do, though the estate is mine; but he mustn’t interfere with my rights.”  “That’s right, Master Hector. Why don’t you speak to your uncle about it? I would, if I were you.”  “So I will, if it is necessary. I will speak to Guy first, and that may be sufficient. I don’t want to enter complaint against him if I can help it.”  “You didn’t see Master Guy ride out, did you?”  “‘No; I was reading. If I had seen him, I would have stopped him.”  “I am afraid it wouldn’t have done any good.”  “Do you mean that he would have taken the buggy in spite of me?” asked Hector, indignantly.  “I think he would have tried. To tell the truth, Master Hector, I refused to get the buggy ready for him, till he brought out a paper from his father commanding me to do it. Then, of course, I had no choice.”  Hector was staggered by this.  “Have you got the paper?” he asked.  “Yes,” answered Edward, fumbling in his vest pocket.  He drew out a small scrap of notepaper, on which was written, “My son, Guy, has my permission to ride out in the buggy. You will obey me rather than Hector.”  This was signed, “Allan Roscoe.”  “So it seems my uncle is the trespasser,” said Hector. “It is he who takes the responsibility. I will go and speak to him at once.”  “Wait a minute! There comes Master Guy, returning from his ride. You can have it out with him first.”  In fact, Hector had only to look down the avenue to see the rapid approach of the buggy. Guy held the reins, and was seated in the driver’s seat with all the air of a master. The sight aggravated Hector, and not without reason. He waited until Guy, flinging the reins to Edward, leaped from the buggy, then he thought it time to speak.  “Guy,” he said, calmly, “it seems to me that you owe me an apology.”  “Oh, I do, do I?” sneered Guy. “What for, let me ask?”  “You have driven out in my buggy, without asking my permission.”  “Oh, it’s your buggy, is it?” said Guy, with another sneer.  “Of course it is. You know that as well as I do.”  “I don’t know it at all.”  “Then I inform you of it. I don’t want to be selfish; I am willing that you should ride out in it occasionally; but I insist upon your asking my permission.”  Guy listened to these words with a sneer upon his face. He was about the same age and size as Hector, but his features were mean and insignificant, and there was a shifty look in his eye that stamped him as unreliable. He did not look like the Roscoes, though in many respects he was in disposition and character similar to his father.  “It strikes me,” he said, with an unpleasant smile, “that you’re taking a little too much upon yourself, Hector Roscoe. The buggy is no more yours than mine.”  “What do you say, Edward?” said Hector, appealing to the coachman.  “I say that the buggy is yours, and the horse is yours, and so I told Master Guy, but he wouldn’t take no notice of it.”  “Do you hear that, Guy?”  “Yes, I do; and that’s what I think of it,” answered Guy, snapping his fingers. “My father gave me permission to ride out in it, and I’ve got just as much right to it as you, and perhaps more.”  “You know better, Guy,” said Hector, indignantly; “and I warn you not to interfere with my rights hereafter.”  “Suppose I do?” sneered Guy.  “Then I shall be under the necessity of giving you a lesson,” said Hector, calmly.  “You will, will you? You’ll give me a lesson?” repeated Guy, nodding vigorously. “Who are you, I’d like to know?”  “If you don’t know, I can tell you.”  “Tell me, then.”  “I am Hector Roscoe, the owner of Roscoe Hall. Whether your father is to be my guardian or not, I don’t know; but there are limits to the power of a guardian, and I hope he won’t go too far.”  “Hear the boy talk!” said Guy, contemptuously.  “I wish to treat my uncle with becoming respect; but he is a newcomer here--I never saw him till three months since--and he has no right to come here, and take from me all my privileges. We can all live at peace together, and I hope we shall; but he must treat me well.”  “You are quite sure Roscoe Castle belongs to you, are you, Hector?”  “That’s the law. Father left no will, and so the estate comes to me.”  “Ho! ho!” laughed Guy, with malicious glee.  “If you only knew what I know, you wouldn’t crow quite so loud. It’s a splendid joke.”  There was something in this that attracted Hector’s attention, though he was not disposed to attach much importance to what Guy said.  “If I only knew what you know!” he repeated.  “Yes; that’s what I said.”  “What is it?”  “You’ll know it soon enough, and I can tell you one thing, it’ll surprise you. It’ll take down your pride a peg or two.”  Hector stared at his cousin in unaffected surprise. What could Guy possibly mean? Had his father perhaps made a will, and left the estate to some one else--his uncle, for example? Was this the meaning of Guy’s malicious mirth?  “I don’t know to what you refer,” he said; “but if it’s anything that is of importance to me, I ought to know it. What is it?”  “Go and ask father,” said Guy, with a tantalizing grin.  “I will,” answered Hector, “and without delay.”  He turned to enter the house, but Guy had not exhausted his malice. He was in a hurry to triumph over Hector, whom he disliked heartily.  “I don’t mind telling you myself,” he said.  “You are not what you suppose. You’re a lowborn beggar!”  He had no sooner uttered these words, than Hector resented the insult. Seizing the whip from Guy, he grasped him by the collar, flung him to the ground and lashed him with it.  “There,” said he, with eyes aflame, “take that, Guy Roscoe, and look out how you insult me in future!”  Guy rose slowly from the ground, pale with fury, and, as he brushed the dust from his clothes, ejaculated:  “You’ll pay dearly for this, Hector!”  “I’ll take the consequences,” said Hector, as coldly as his anger would allow. “Now, I shall go to your father and ask the meaning of this.”     CHAPTER III. HECTOR LEARNS A SECRET.    Hector entered the library with some impetuosity. Usually he was quiet and orderly, but he had been excited by the insinuations of Guy, and he was impatient to know what he meant--if he meant anything.  Allan Roscoe looked up, and remarked, with slight sarcasm:  “This is not a bear garden, Hector. You appear to think you are on the playground, judging by your hasty motions.”  “I beg your pardon, uncle,” said Hector, who never took amiss a rebuke which he thought deserved. “I suppose I forgot myself, being excited. I beg your pardon.”  “What is the cause of your excitement?” asked Mr. Roscoe, surveying the boy keenly.  “Guy has said something that I don’t understand.”  “He must have said something very profound, then,” returned Allan Roscoe, with light raillery.  “Indeed, Uncle Allan, it is no laughing matter,” said Hector, earnestly.  “Then let me hear what it is.”  “He intimates that he knows something that would let down my pride a peg or two. He hints that I am not the heir of Castle Roscoe.”  The boy used the term by which the house was usually known.  Allan Roscoe knit his brow in pretended vexation.  “Inconsiderate boy!” he murmured. “Why need he say this?”  “But,” said Hector, startled, “is it true?”  “My boy,” said his uncle, with simulated feeling, “my son has spoken to you of a secret which I would willingly keep from you if I could. Yet, perhaps, it is as well that you should be told now.”  “Told what?” exclaimed Hector, quite at sea.  “Can you bear to hear, Hector, that it is indeed true? You are not the owner of this estate.”  “Who is then?” ejaculated the astonished boy.  “I am; and Guy after me.”  “What! Did my father leave the estate away from me? I thought he did not leave a will?”  “Nor did he.”  “Then how can anyone else except his son inherit?”  “Your question is a natural one. If you were his son you would inherit under the law.”  “If I were his son!” repeated Hector, slowly, his head swimming. “What do you mean by that? Of course I am your brother’s son.”  “It is very painful for me to tell, Hector. It will be distressing for you to hear. No tie of blood connects you with the late owner of Castle Roscoe.”  “I don’t believe you, Uncle Allan,” said Hector, bluntly.  “Of course, therefore, I am not your uncle,” added Allan Roscoe, dryly.  “I beg your pardon; I should have said Mr. Allan Roscoe,” said Hector, bowing proudly, for his heart was sore, and he was deeply indignant with the man who sat, smooth and sleek, in his father’s chair, harrowing up his feelings without himself being ruffled.  “That is immaterial. Call me uncle, if you like, since the truth is understood. But I must explain.”  “I would like to know what is your authority for so surprising a statement, Mr. Roscoe. You cannot expect me to believe that I have been deceived all my life.”  “I make the statement on your father’s authority--I should say, on my brother’s authority.”  “Can you prove it, Mr. Roscoe?”  “I can. I will presently put into your hands a letter, written me by my brother some months since, which explains the whole matter. To save you suspense, however, I will recapitulate. Where were you born?”  “In California.”  “That is probably true. It was there that my brother found you.”  “Found me?”  “Perhaps that is not the word. My brother and his wife were boarding in Sacramento in the winter of 1859. In the same boarding house was a widow, with a child of some months old. You were that child. Your mother died suddenly, and it was ascertained that she left nothing. Her child was, therefore, left destitute. It was a fine, promising boy--give me credit for the compliment--and my brother, having no children of his own, proposed to his wife to adopt it. She was fond of children, and readily consented. No formalities were necessary, for there was no one to claim you. You were at once taken in charge by my brother and his wife, therefore, and very soon they came to look upon you with as much"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5674"],["title","Hector's Inheritance, Or, the Boys of Smith Institute (#2)"],["body","as if you were their own child. They wished you to consider them your real parents, and to you the secret was never made known, nor was it known to the world. When my brother returned to this State, three years after, not one of his friends doubted that the little Hector was his own boy.  “When you were six years old your mother died--that is, my brother’s wife. All the more, perhaps, because he was left alone, my brother became attached to you, and, I think, he came to love you as much as if you were his own son.”  “I think he did,” said Hector, with emotion. “Never was there a kinder, more indulgent father.”  “Yet he was not your father,” said Allan Roscoe, with sharp emphasis.  “So you say, Mr. Roscoe.”  “So my brother says in his letter to me.”  “Do you think it probable that, with all this affection for me, he would have left me penniless?” asked the boy.  “No; it was his intention to make a will. By that will he would no doubt have provided for you in a satisfactory manner. But I think my poor brother had a superstitious fear of will making, lest it might hasten death. At any rate, he omitted it till it was too late.”  “It was a cruel omission, if your story is a true one.”  “Your--my brother, did what he could to remedy matters. In his last sickness, when too weak to sign his name, he asked me, as the legal heir of his estate, to see that you were well provided for. He wished me to see your education finished, and I promised to do so. I could see that this promise relieved his mind. Of one thing you may be assured, Hector, he never lost his affection for you.”  “Thank Heaven for that!” murmured the boy, who had been deeply and devotedly attached to the man whom, all his life long, he had looked upon as his father.  “I can only add, Hector,” said Mr. Roscoe, “that I feel for your natural disappointment. It is, indeed, hard to be brought up to regard yourself as the heir of a great estate, and to make the discovery that you have been mistaken.”  “I don’t mind that so much, Mr. Roscoe,” said Hector, slowly. “It is the hardest thing to think of myself as having no claim upon one whom I have loved as a father--to think myself as a boy of unknown parentage. But,”  he added, suddenly, “I have it only on your word. Why should I believe it?”  “I will give you conclusive proof, Hector. Read this.”  Allan Roscoe took from his pocket a letter, without an envelope. One glance served to show Hector that it was in the handwriting of his late father, or, at any rate, in a handwriting surprisingly like it.  He began to read it with feverish haste.  The letter need not find a place here. The substance of it had been accurately given by Mr. Allan Roscoe. Apparently, it corroborated his every statement.  The boy looked up from its perusal, his face pale and stricken.  “You see that I have good authority for my statement,” said Mr. Roscoe.  “I can’t understand it,” said Hector, slowly.  “I need only add,” said Mr. Roscoe, apparently relieved by the revelation, “that my brother did not repose confidence in me in vain. I accept, as a sacred charge, the duty he imposed upon me. I shall provide for you and look after your education. I wish to put you in a way to prepare yourself for a useful and honorable career. As a first step, I intend, on Monday next, to place you in an excellent boarding school, where you will have exceptional privileges.”  Hector listened, but his mind was occupied by sad thoughts, and he made no comment.  “I have even selected the school with great care,” said Mr. Roscoe. “It is situated at Smithville, and is under the charge of Socrates Smith, A. M., a learned and distinguished educator. You may go now. I will speak with you on this subject later.”  Hector bowed. After what he had heard, his interest in other matters was but faint.  “I shall be glad to get him out of the house,” thought Allan Roscoe. “I never liked him.”     CHAPTER IV. A SKIRMISH.    Hector walked out of the house in a state of mental bewilderment not easily described. Was he not Hector Roscoe, after all? Had he been all his life under a mistake? If this story were true, who was he, who were his parents, what was his name? Why had the man whom he had supposed to be his father not imparted to him this secret? He had always been kind and indulgent; he had never appeared to regard the boy as an alien in blood, but as a dearly loved son. Yet, if he had, after all, left him unprovided for, he had certainly treated Hector with great cruelty.  “I won’t believe it,” said Hector, to himself.  “I won’t so wrong my dear father’s memory at the bidding of this man, whose interest it is to trump up this story, since he and his son become the owners of a great estate in my place.”  Just then Guy advanced toward Hector with a malicious smile upon his face. He knew very well what a blow poor Hector had received, for he was in his father’s confidence, and he was mean enough, and malicious enough, to rejoice at it.  “What’s the matter with you, Hector?” he asked, with a grin. “You look as if you had lost your last friend.”  Hector stopped short and regarded Guy fixedly.  “Do you know what your father has been saying to me?” he asked.  “Well, I can guess,” answered Guy. “Ho! ho! It’s a great joke that you have all the time fancied yourself the heir of Castle Roscoe, when you have no claim to it at all. I am the heir!” he added, drawing himself up proudly; “and you are a poor dependent, and a nobody. It’s funny!”  “Perhaps you won’t think it so funny after this!” said Hector, coolly, exasperated beyond endurance. As he spoke he drew off, and in an instant Guy measured his length upon the greensward.  Guy rose, his face livid with passion, in a frame of mind far from funny. He clinched his fists and looked at Hector as if he wished to annihilate him. “You’ll pay for this,” he screamed. “You’ll repent it, bitterly, you poor, nameless dependent, low-born, very likely--”  “Hold, there!” said Hector, advancing resolutely, and sternly facing the angry boy. “Be careful what you say. If this story of your father’s is true, which I don’t believe, you might have the decency to let me alone, even if you don’t sympathize with me. If you dare to say or hint anything against my birth, I’ll treat you worse than I have yet.”  “You’ll suffer for this!” almost shrieked Guy.  “I am ready to suffer now, if you are able to make me,” said Hector. “Come on, and we’ll settle it now.”  But Guy had no desire for the contest to which he was invited. He had a wholesome fear of Hector’s strong, muscular arms, aided, as they were, by some knowledge of boxing. Hector had never taken regular lessons, but a private tutor, whom his father had employed, a graduate of Yale, had instructed him in the rudiments of the “manly art of self-defense,” and Hector was very well able to take care of himself against any boy of his own size and strength. In size, Guy was his equal, but in strength he was quite inferior. This Guy knew full well, and, angry as he was, he by no means lost sight of prudence.  “I don’t choose to dirty my hands with you,” he said. “I shall tell my father, and it would serve you right if he sent you adrift.”  In Hector’s present mood, he would not, perhaps, have cared much if this threat had been carried into execution, but he was not altogether reckless, and he felt that it was best to remain under Mr. Roscoe’s protection until he had had time to investigate the remarkable story which he suspected his reputed uncle had trumped up to serve his own interests.  “Tell your father, if you like,” said Hector, quietly. “I don’t know whether he will sustain you or not in your insults, but if he does, then I shall have two opponents instead of one.”  “Does that mean that you will attack my father?” demanded Guy, hoping for an affirmative answer, as it would help him to prejudice his father against our hero.  “No,” answered Hector, smiling, “I don’t apprehend there will be any necessity, for he won’t insult me as you have done.”  Guy lost no time in seeking his father, and laying the matter before him, inveighing against Hector with great bitterness.  “So he knocked you down, did he, Guy?” asked Allan Roscoe, thoughtfully.  “Yes; he took me unawares, or he couldn’t have done it,” answered Guy, a little ashamed at the avowal.  “What did you do?”  “I--I told him he should suffer for it.”  “Why did he attack you?”  “It was on account of something I said.”  “What was it?”  Guy reluctantly answered this question, and with correctness.  “It was your fault for speaking to him when he was feeling sore at making a painful discovery.”  “Do you justify him in pitching into me like a big brute?” asked Guy, hastily.  “No; but still, I think it, was natural, under the circumstances. You should have kept out of his way, and let him alone.”  “Won’t you punish him for attacking me?” demanded Guy, indignantly.  “I will speak to him on the subject,” said Allan Roscoe; “and will tell him my opinion of his act.”  “Then shan’t I be revenged upon him?” asked Guy, disappointed.  “Listen, Guy,” said his father. “Is it no punishment that the boy is stripped of all his possessions, while you step into his place? Henceforth he will be dependent upon me, and later, upon you. He has been hurled down from his proud place as owner of Castle Roscoe, and I have taken his place, as you will hereafter do.”  “Yes,” said Guy, gleefully; “it will be a proud day when I become master of the estate.”  Allan Roscoe was not a specially sensitive man, but this remark of his son jarred upon him.  “You seem to forget, Guy, that you do not succeed till I am dead!”  “Yes, I suppose so,” answered Guy, slowly.  “It almost seems as if you were in a hurry for me to die.”  “I didn’t mean that, but it’s natural to suppose that I shall live longer than you do, isn’t it?”  “I suppose so,” returned Allan Roscoe, shortly.  “Of course that’s what I mean.”  “Then, since you are so much better off than Hector, you had better be more"]]]
