He is one who stimulates the imagination and raises the standards of art in whatever he models. His work is pregnant with life and is thoroughly individual, so that you feel when you look upon his figures that you have met more than mere bronze or marble. His portraits are of a very high order, many of which can be seen in medal form in the Fine Arts Palace. He lives in New York, where he is well appreciated.    Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney  Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney is one of the foremost American woman sculptors. The Fountain of El Dorado is her first public contribution.    Bruno Zimm  Bruno Zimm, living in New York, was a pupil of the late Karl Bitter. He has designed work for former Expositions, and we trust that his name will be better known in the future. He has added great beauty to the Fine Arts Palace by his classic friezes designed in effective, bold masses. The archaic style used in his work is evident in many of the sculptural forms at this Exposition.    Sculpture Around the Fine Arts Lagoon    The first group of statuary in the following list is located on the south-east side of the Fine Arts Lagoon. Proceeding thence to the left and through the colonnade, the most important subjects will be found in the order described.  Sea Lions. Frederick G. R. Roth       Most carefully studied as to form and babies; you almost: hear the bark       of the great mate.  The Scout. Cyrus Edwin Dallin       The horse and the Indian wait motionless; his hand shading his eyes from       the sun, the Indian looks intently into the distance for sign of the       enemy.  Wind and Spray. Anna Coleman Ladd       A ring of figures - male and female - fleeting and gay - like the wind       and the spray.  Diana. Haig Patigian       The goddess of the hunt appears with her bow; the arrow has just left       the string.  Peace. Sherry Fry       Quiet, serene, she stands, her brow bedecked with olive leaves; her       serpent bordered robe may betoken the wisdom of peace.  The Kirkpatrick Fountain (extreme left).

Ward       A noted American clergyman, lecturer, reformer, author, journalist;       lived between 1813 and 1887; a man of forceful personality and fine       intellect; he looks the very man of opinions who would not hesitate to       give them to you - and you would be prone to accept them.

A Muse Finding the Head of Orpheus.

Michael Angelo. Robert Ingersoll Aitken       We seem to hear him say \"And now where next to place the chisel?\" He is       creating \"Day,\" which is seen in the Medici Chapel, Church of San       Lorenzo, Florence, Italy.  Nymph. Isidore Konti       A poetic conception of the origin of the stream, from which the fawn       drinks.  Young Pan. Janet Scudder       A favorite subject. Pan is piping his woodland notes and marching to his       own music. Such expressive little hands are those that hold the pipes!       The crab comes up to listen and is held - spellbound.  Wildflower. Edward Berge       Everybody's love! A real darling! A little flower of the fields.  Mother and Child.

Furio Piccirilli       Orpheus has just looked back-Eurydice, realizing that he is forever lost       to her, looks mournfully after him. Great longing fills her soul.  Boy and Frog.

Olin Warner       Her pine-cone wand thrown down, her pan-pipes cast aside, the       ivory-crowned nymph indulges in the dance.  The Outcast.

Charles Cary Rumsey       The youth who is just beginning to gather his sheaves, looks up and sees       the stars! A new treatment in sculpture.  The Pioneer Mother. Charles Grafly       A simple, dignified woman dressed in home-spun. At her knees a boy and a       girl - the future builders of the Western country. She has crossed the       cactus-covered plains, has endured the greatest hardships, that she may       rear her sturdy little ones to lay the foundations of a mighty Western       empire. The bulls' heads are symbolic of sacrifice; oak leaves symbolize       strength. She is best seen in the afternoon.  Thomas Jefferson. Karl Bitter       The seated president, with a world of thought upon his face, has on his       lap the Declaration of Independence.  Lincoln.

Best seen       from across the road.  William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878)       An American poet of the first rank. He sits thoughtfully - his       manuscript before him. Laurels grace his pedestal.  The Sower. Albin Polasek       Along the field he goes, scattering his seed.  Centaur. Olga Popoff Muller       This bestial creature is in the act of abducting a beautiful woman. She       has almost swooned from fright.  The Boy with the Fish. Bela Pratt       They are singing for joy - the fish seeming to be most comfortably at       home. Even the little turtle is happy. The little toes must not be       overlooked.  Returning from the Hunt. John J.

Evelyn Beatrice Longman       A group of tender, loving trustfulness. In the background are seen angel       heads, denoting the spiritual side of love.

Edith Woodman Burroughs       Is this little Adam with the apple, or only a little boy with a ball?  Youth. Victor H. Salvatore       A little maid in sweet simplicity - against the shrubbery.  Soldier of Marathon. Paul Noquet       Recalling one of the Niobids of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. The last       dying agony of a Greek soldier. His shield stands at the left.  Primitive Man. Olga Popoff Muller       He hauls the quarry home. Would the nose of primitive man be so lacking       in primitiveness?  The Scalp. Edward Berge       The Indian stands exultant! His hands alone betray what has happened.       The rest of the work is most carefully treated to cover the barbarous       side of the subject.  Apollo Hunting. Haig Patigian       \"I shot an arrow into the air.\" This muscular figure recalls the work on       Machinery Palace done by the same sculptor.  A Faun's Toilet. Attilio Piccirilli       An awkward, somewhat bashful, wholly boyish faun - his costume an ivy       crown.  Duck Baby. Edith Barretto Parsons       A gleeful little soul with chubby toes - more gleeful than the quacking       ducks she squeezes.  A Maiden of the Roman Campagna. Albin Polasek       Like an antique bronze from Pompeii. The anemones in her braided hair       are surely some of those that grow so plentifully on the great Campagna       beyond Rome.

The       United States is symbolized by the eagle.  Rock and Flower Group. Anna Coleman Ladd       A decorative group with no special meaning. It might be called \"Idle       Moments.\"  Great Danes. Anna Vaughan Hyatt       Watchful Danes guard well the portals.

Holm       The \"first mother\" holds her babe to her breast.  The Fountain of Time, Lorado Taft       The great ocean of Time is rolling on, carrying with it men and women of       all conditions of thought. Some advance blindly, some hopelessly, some       fearfully, some buffeted by the great waves as they roll on.  Nymph - A Garden Figure. Edward T. Quinn       Showing how any figure gains in beauty by being placed among the       shrubbery.  The Dying Lion. Paul Wayland Bartlett       A powerful and most realistic group.

Beta Pratt       Such was the type of man who left the town of New Bedford,       Massachusetts, a whaling port, to seek his occupation in northern water."]]]
