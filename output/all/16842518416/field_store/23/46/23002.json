He knew Charles's delicate appreciation of music, and could confidently anticipate that her voice would satisfy him and win his interest.  But if this occurred, and the sovereign learned that Wolf wished to marry the singer to whom their Majesties owed such great pleasure, it would be an easy matter for the Emperor to place him in a position which could not fail to content the just desire of the girl whom he loved for an existence free from want.  The interview with the monarch, to which he was to lead Barbara at once, therefore seemed to him like a bridge to her consent, and when he met at the Ark the court musician, Massi, followed by a servant carrying his violin case, he called to him: \"Just look at the shining stars up above us, Massi!  They are friendly to me, and, if they keep their promise, the journey here will be blessed.\"  \"Amen!\" replied the other as he pressed his hand cordially and asked for further particulars; but Wolf put him off until the next day, exclaim ing: \"Jungfrau Blomberg, whose voice and execution bewitched you also, is now to sing before his Majesty.  Wish her the best luck, for on her success depend many things for her, and perhaps for your friend also. Once more, uphold us!\"  He turned toward the Grieb as he spoke, and the longing for Barbara quickened his pace.  The fear that the gouty monarch could cherish any other wishes concerning the young girl than to enjoy her singing was farthest from his thoughts.  Who would ever have seen an aspirant for woman's favour in the suffering Emperor, bowed during the last few years by the heaviest political cares, and whose comparative youthfulness was easily overlooked?  At the main entrance of the Grieb Wolf was accosted by the master of the house.  The wife of this obedient husband, Frau Lerch, known throughout all Ratisbon as \"Lerch, the mantuamaker,\" had told him to keep watch, and impressed it upon him to let no one, no matter who it might be, enter her rooms on the ground floor except the cantor knight, as she called Wolf.  Barbara had had little time for reflection as she fled from the Emperor's envoys, but a clever woman's brain thinks quickly when an important decision is to be made, and while turning the gray she had decided that it would be better for her purpose, and the haste connected with it, to go to Frau Lerch than to her own home.  In the Grieb she was sure of finding admittance at once if she knocked at Frau Lerch's window, while the cantor house was closed early, and a long time might pass before the door opened to her.  Besides, she did not know how her father, who could never be depended upon in such matters, would regard the honour that awaited her; thirdly--and this alone was decisive --the white dress, which she meant to wear instead of the riding habit, was at Frau Lerch's, and what good service the skilful, nimble fingers of her mother's ex-maid could render in this hurried change of garb.  Besides, it had also darted into her mind that the baron might accompany her to her shabby abode, and that would have seemed like a humiliation. Why should the court know what indigent circumstances had been the portion of the artist to whom the Emperor, through no less a personage than Baron Malfalconnet, sent an \"entreaty\" for her appearance?  All this had been clear to her in the course of a few seconds, and her choice had proved fortunate, for the gate of the Grieb was still unlocked, and the old hostler Kunz, who had been in the service of the Gravenreuths, the former owners of the Grieb, and had known \"Wawerl\" from childhood, was just coming out of the tavern, and willingly agreed to take the gray back to Peter Schlumperger's stable.  When Barbara entered the huge building a ray of light shone from the private chapel at the left, dedicated to Saint Dorothea.  This seemed to her like a sign from heaven, and, before knocking at Frau Lerch's door, she glided into the sanctuary, threw herself upon her knees before the image of the saint, and besought her to bestow the most melting sweetness and the deepest influence upon her voice while singing before his Majesty.  Then it seemed as though the face of the kindly saint smiled assent, and in hurried words Barbara added that the great monarch was also the most thorough connoisseur, and the altar here should lack neither candles nor flowers if she would bestow upon her the power to win his approval. While speaking, she raised her clasped hands toward the Virgin's image, and concluded her fervent prayer with the passionate exclamation: \"Oh, hear me, hear me, thou inexhaustible fountain of mercy, for if I do not fulfil what he expected when he entreated me to sing before him, and I see that he lets me go disappointed, the peace of this heart will be destroyed!  Hear, oh, hear me, august Queen of Heaven!\"  Relieved and strengthened, she at last sprang up, and a few minutes after Frau Lerch, with loud exclamations of admiration, was combing her long, thick, waving locks of fair hair.  Overflowing with delight at such beauty, the thin little woman then helped her \"darling Wawerl,\" her \"wonderfully sweet nightingale,\" to change her dress.  Wolf's gift, the velvet robe with the marten border, would have been too heavy and oppressive for singing, and, besides, was not yet finished. Barbara, she declared, had done right to choose the white one, which was intended for the next dance at the New Scales.  Nothing could be more becoming to her enchanting little princess, and Barbara yielded herself entirely to the experienced assistant, who had all the laces and ribbons she needed close at hand.  She could even supply her with new and dainty satin shoes.  While Frau Lerch was working with wonderful dexterity, she also permitted her nimble tongue no rest.  In the tenderest accents of faithful maternal solicitude she counselled her how to conduct herself in his Majesty's presence.  Hurriedly showing Barbara how the stiff Spanish ladies of the court curtsied, she exclaimed: \"And another thing, my darling pet: It is important for all ladies, even those of royal blood, to try to win the favour of so great a monarch when they meet him for the first time.  You can use your eyes, too, and how effectually!  I saw you a short time ago, and, if I had been a young gentleman, how gladly I would have changed places with the handsome recruiting officer Pyramus at the New Scales! That was a flaming fire!  Now, isn't it true, darling--now we no longer have even a single glance for such insignificant fellows!  Consider that settled!  But things of that sort have no effect upon his august Majesty. You must cast down your sparkling blue eyes in modest embarrassment, as if you still wore the confirmation wreath.  All the fashionable sons of the burghers complain of your repellent coldness.  Let his Majesty feel it too.  That will pour oil on the flames, and they must blaze up high; I'd stake both my hands on it, much as I need them.  But if it results as I expect, my darling, don't forget old Lerch, who loves you even more than your own mother did.  How beautiful and stately she was!  But she forgot her little Wawerl only too often.  I have a faithful nature, child, and understand life.  If, sooner or later, you need the advice of a true, helpful friend, you know where to find little old Lerch.\"  These warnings had sounded impressive enough, but Barbara had by no means listened attentively.  Instead, she had been anticipating, with torturing impatience, her appearance before the great man for whom she was adorned and the songs which she would have to sing.  If she was permitted to choose herself, he would also hear the bird-song, with the \"Car la saison est bonne,\" which had extorted such enthusiastic applause from the Netherland maestro.  But no!  She must choose something grander, more solemn, for she wished to make a deeper, stronger, more lasting impression upon the man who was now to listen to her voice.  Mere lukewarm satisfaction would not content her in the case of the Emperor Charles; she wished to arouse his enthusiasm, his rapture.  What bliss it would be if she was permitted to penetrate deeply into his soul, if it were allotted to her to make the ruler's grave eyes sparkle with radiant delight!  In increasing excitement, she saw herself, in imagination, lowering the sheet of music, and the sovereign, deeply moved, holding out both hands to her.  But that would have been too much happiness!  What if the violent throbbing of her heart should silence her voice?  What if the oppressive timidity, which conquers every one who for the first time is permitted to stand in the presence of majesty, should cause her to lose her memory and be unable to find the mood which she required in order to execute her task with the perfection that hovered before her mind?  Yes, that would happen!  With cruel self-torture she dwelt upon the terrible dread, for she thought she had noticed that the best success often followed when she had expected the worst result.  Fran Lerch perceived what was passing in her mind, and instilled courage until she had finished her work and held up the mirror before Barbara.  The girl, whether she desired to do so or not, could not help looking in. She did it reluctantly, and, after hastily assuring herself that she was presentable, she turned the glittering disk away and would not glance at it again.  She feared that the contemplation of her own image might disturb her; she wished to think only of the worthy execution of her task, and the shorter time she kept the Emperor waiting the less she need fear having an ill- humoured listener.  So she hurriedly ejaculated a few words of gratitude to the old attendant and seized the kerchief for her head, which she had taken to Prufening with her; but the dressmaker wound around her hair a costly lace veil which she had ready for a customer.  \"The valuable article may be lost,\" she thought.  \"But if, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5563"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 03 (#7)"],["body","or later, something happens which my lambkin, who thinks only of her sweet babble, does not dream, it will return to me with interest.  Besides, she must see what maternal affection I feel for her.\"  Then, with tender caution, she kissed the girl's glowing cheeks, and the blessing with which she at last dismissed her sounded devout and loving enough.  Wolf had not waited long; it was just striking eleven when Barbara met him at the door talking with Herr Lerch, the owner of the house.  Before leaving the Grieb, she again glanced into the chapel in the courtyard dedicated to Saint Dorothea, and uttered a swift though silent prayer for good success, and that her singing might have a deep influence upon the august hearer.  Meanwhile she scarcely heeded what her friend was saying, and, while walking at his side the short distance through a part of Red Cock Street and across the Haidplatz, he had no words from her lips except the request that he would tell her father of the great honour awaiting her.  Wolf, too, had imposed silence upon himself; it was necessary for the singer, on the eve of this important performance, to refrain from talking in the night air.     CHAPTER XV.  Baron Malfalconnet possessed the gift of lending Time wings and using the simplest incident as the foundation for an entertaining story.  He knew that his Majesty did not like waiting, and the quarter of an hour which Barbara had mentioned might easily become a longer period.  So he adorned the description of his ride as an envoy most generously with many partially invented details.  Wolf, Herr Peter Schlumperger, Frau Kastenmayr, his estimable sister, and the party of Ratisbon excursionists, upon whom he had scarcely bestowed a passing glance, all played a large and by no means enviable part.  But he gained his object, for the impatient monarch listened gladly, and all the more willingly in proportion to the more brilliant eloquence with which the clever connoisseur of mankind placed Barbara in contrast to all the obscure, insignificant, and ridiculous personages whom he pretended to have met.  The peculiar charm which her individuality thus obtained corresponded with the idea which the monarch himself had formed of the expected guest, and it flattered him to hear his conjecture so remarkably confirmed.  A few questions from the monarch followed the baron's report.  While the latter was still answering the last one, Chamberlain de Praet announced the singer's arrival, and Count Bueren escorted the aged Marquise de Leria to the monarch.  The Emperor went at once to the table, and as he descended the stairs, leaning lightly on Malfalconnet's arm, it was scarcely perceptible that he used the left foot less firmly than the other.  According to his command, only the small table at which he was to sit with the marquise had been laid in the dining-room.  The boy choir had taken a position opposite to it.  At his entrance Barbara rose quickly from the chair, into which she had sunk by no means from weariness.  With a throbbing heart, and still heavily oppressed by anxiety, she awaited the next moments and what they would bring.  The Benedictio Mensae was again to open the concert.  She needed no notes for this familiar music.  Yet she looked toward Appenzelder, who had thanked her for her appearance as if she had done him a great favour.  Now the orchestra behind her was silent.  Now she saw the lackeys and attendants bow profoundly.  Now Appenzelder raised his arm.  She saw it, but he had not yet touched the desk with the little ebony staff, and she availed herself of the pause to glance toward the anxiously expected sovereign, whose presence she felt.  There he stood.  Barbara scarcely noticed the old lady at his left; he, he alone captivated her eyes, her heart, her senses, her whole being.  What a happy surprise!  How Wolf, Maestro Gombert, and others had described the Emperor, and how he stood before her!  This chivalrous, superb, almost youthful gentleman and hero, whose haughty, self-assured bearing so admirably suited the magnificence of his rich-hued garments, was said to be a gouty old man, bowed by the weight of care!  Had it not been so abominable, it would have tempted her to laugh.  How petty men were, how cruel was the fate of the great, to whom envy clings like their own shadow, and whose image was basely distorted even by those who knew the grandeur of their intellect and their deeds, and who owed to them their best success in life!  Her heart beat for this man, not only with the artist's desire to satisfy the connoisseur, no, but with stormy passion--she felt it now; yet, though the god of love was called a blind boy, she had retained the full, clear strength of vision and the absolute power of discernment.  No one, not even the handsomest young knight, could compare in her eyes with the mature, powerful guide of the destiny of many millions, whose lofty brow was illumined by the grandeur of his intellect, and with whose name the memory of glorious victories was associated.  The pride justified by his birth had led him from one lofty deed to another, and he could not help carrying his head so high, for how far all the rest of mankind lay beneath him!  There was no living mortal to whom the Emperor Charles would have been obliged to look up, or before whom he need bow his head at all.  She would fain have been able to stamp his image deeply, ineffaceably upon her soul.  But, alas!  Just at that moment a short, imperious sound reached her ear. Appenzelder had struck the desk with his baton.  The Benedictio must begin at once, and now her breath was really coming so quickly that it seemed impossible for her to sing in this condition.  Deeply troubled, she pressed her hand upon her bosom.  Then the cruel, tyrannical baton struck the wood a second time, and----  But what did this mean?  The Emperor had left his elderly companion after she was seated at the table, and was advancing--her eyes, clouded by anxious expectation, did not deceive her--and was walking with stately dignity toward the boy choir; no, not to it, but directly toward herself.--Now it seemed as though her heart stood still.  At no price could she have produced even a single note.  But it was not required, for the wave of the imperial hand which she saw was to Appenzelder, and commanded him to silence his choir.  The unexpected movement concerned her alone, and ere Barbara found time to ask herself what brought him to her, he already stood before her.  How friendly and yet how chivalrously stately as the slight bow which the monarch bestowed upon her; and he had scarcely done so when, in peculiar German, whose strange accent seemed to her extremely charming and musical, he exclaimed: \"we welcome you to the Golden Cross, fairest of maidens.  You now behold what man can accomplish when he strives for anything with genuine zeal.  The wisest among the wise declare that even gods fail in the conflict against the obstinacy of beautiful women, and yet our longing desire succeeded in capturing you, lovely fugitive.\"  Barbara alternately flushed and paled as she listened to these words.  She had not heard Frau Lerch's counsel, and yet, obedient to a secret impulse, she timidly lowered her blue eyes.  But not a word of the sovereign had escaped her, and, though she still lacked the power of speech, she found courage to smile and shake her head in denial.  The Emperor did not miss a single change of feature, and, swiftly understanding her mute contradiction, went on gaily: \"Look! look!  So, fairest of the fair, you refuse to acknowledge our glorious victory? That bears witness to a specially independent comprehension of things. But we, how are we to explain such a denial of an accomplished fact?\"  Then Barbara stunmoned up courage and answered, still with downcast eyes, \"But, your Majestv, how can I regard myself as conquered and captured when I voluntarily yielded to your Majesty's wish?\"  \"And may I perhaps also hope that it gives you pleasure to grant my entreaty?\" asked the sovereign in a subdued tone, gazing as he spoke deep into the eyes which the young girl had just raised to his.  Barbara did not instantly find the reply she sought, and only bent her head in assent, but the Emperor was not satisfied with this mute answer, and eagerly desired to learn whether it was so difficult for her to admit what he so ardently wished to hear.  Meanwhile her quick intellect had found the fitting response, and, with a look which told the questioner more than she intended to betray, she answered softly: \"Why should I not have fulfilled your Majesty's request gladly and proudly?  But what followed the walk here, what befell me here, is so much more beautiful and greater--\"  \"And may we know,\" interrupted the Emperor urgently, \"what you find here that affords your heart so much pleasure?  \"You and your favour,\" she answered quickly, and the flush which suddenly crimsoned her cheeks showed him how deeply she was moved.  Then Charles went close to her and whispered: \"And do you wish to know, most bewitching woman, how he, in whose presence you confess that you are glad to remain, looked forward to your coming?  As he would greet happiness, spring.  And note that I look you in the face, it seems as though Easter bells were pealing the resurrection of a love long buried in this breast.  And you, maiden, you will not belie this hope?\"  Barbara clung to the back of the chair for support, while from her deeply agitated soul struggled the exclamation: \"This poor heart, my lord, belongs to you--to you alone!  How it mastered me, who can describe?  But here, my lord, now----\"  Then the monarch whispered warmly: \"You are right.  What we have to say to each other requires a more fitting time and a different place, and we will find them.\"  Then he stepped back, drew himself up to his full height, waved his hand to her with gracious condescension, and in a loud, imperious tone commanded"]]]
