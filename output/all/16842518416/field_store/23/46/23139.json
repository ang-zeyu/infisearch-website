They're fine young things, every one of them--Whitneys, Peppers and my boy--as fine as they are made. And whoever says they're not, doesn't know a good piece of work when it's before his eyes. Bless me!\" pulling out his handkerchief to mop his face violently, \"I don't want to see any finer.\"  \"I hope I shall have a sight of Jasper's and Polly's faces when you tell them what you intend to do,\" said Mrs. Whitney; \"where are your cards, father?\"  \"Tell them? I shan't tell them at all,\" cried the old gentleman; \"I'm going to have a surprise, too. No one must know it but you and Mrs. Pepper.\"  \"Oh!\" said Mrs. Whitney. \"It was very stupid in me not to understand that. It will be all right, father; Mrs. Pepper and I will keep our secret, you needn't fear.\"  \"If you can only keep HER out of the way,\" exclaimed Mr. King, pointing irascibly in the direction of Mrs. Chatterton's apartments, \"all will be well. But I doubt if you can; her meddlesome ears and tongue will be at work as usual,\" he added in extreme vexation.  \"Here comes Jasper,\" exclaimed Mrs. Whitney, which had the satisfactory result of bringing her father out of his irritation, into a flutter over the concealment of the party preparations.  \"Jasper,\" cried Polly that evening, as they ran into the music-room to play a duet, \"we're all right about everything now, as your father says we may invite the girls and your friends.\"  \"And he said when I asked him if we ought not to have cake and coffee, 'I'll attend to that,'\" said Jasper, \"so everything is all straight as far as I can see, Polly.\"  \"The private boxes trouble me, I must confess,\" said Polly, drumming absently on the keys, while Jasper spread the sheet of music on the rack. \"You know there must be two; one for dear Mr. King and one for the boys as guests of honor. Now how shall we manage them?\"  She took her hand off suddenly from the keys and folded it over its fellow on her knee, to study his face anxiously.  \"It's pretty hard to get them up, that's a fact,\" said Jasper truthfully, \"but then, you know, Polly, we've always found that when a thing had to be done, it was done. You know the little brown house taught us that.\"  \"So it did,\" said Polly, brightening up. \"Dear little old brown house, how could I ever forget it! Well, I suppose,\" with a sigh, \"it will come to us as an inspiration when it's time to fix them.\"  \"I suppose so too,\" said Mrs. Pepper, passing the door, as usual with her mending basket, \"and when two people start to play a duet, I think they much better put their minds on that, and not waste precious time on all sorts of questions that will take care of themselves when the time comes.\"  \"You are right, Mrs. Pepper,\" cried Jasper with a laugh, and seating himself before the piano. \"Come, Polly!\"  \"Mamsie is always right, isn't she, Jasper?\" cried Polly with pride, putting her hands down for the first chords.  \"Indeed she is,\" responded the boy heartily. \"Here now, Polly, remember, you slipped up a bit on that first bar. Now!\"  The twenty-first of December came all too soon for Polly and Jasper, whose school duties had engrossed them till two days before, but after hard work getting up the stage properties, and the many rehearsals, everything was at last pronounced ready, the drawing-room and music-room locked, the keys given to Mrs. Whitney who promised faithfully to see that no one peeped in who should not, and Polly hurried into her hat and jacket, to go to the station with Jasper to meet the boys.  Thomas drove furiously, as they were a bit late, and they arrived only a minute before the train puffed in.  \"Here they are!\" cried Polly, and \"Here they are!\" cried Jasper, together, in great excitement, on the platform.  \"Halloo, Polly!\" cried Joel, prancing out of the car first, and \"How d'ye do, Polly?\" as they all hurried after. \"Halloo, Jasper!\"  \"Oh, Polly! it's good to see you!\" This from Davie, not ashamed to set a kiss on her red lips.  Van and Percy looked as if they wanted to, but contented themselves with wringing her hand nearly off, while Joel declared he would look after the luggage.  \"No, I will,\" cried Van, dropping Polly's hand.  \"You forget,\" said Percy quietly, \"I hold the checks, I'll attend to it myself.\" He unclosed his brown traveling glove, and Van, at sight of them, turned back.  \"Go along, do, then,\" he cried; \"I don't want to, I'm sure; I'd much rather stay with Polly. How d'ye do, Thomas?\" he called carelessly to the coachman on his box, who was continually touching his hat and indulging in broad smiles of content.  Polly was tiptoeing in very delight, holding Davie's hand closely while her eyes roved from one to the other of the boys, and her tongue ran fast indeed. A group of girls, who had also come down to the station to meet friends, stopped a bit as they came laughing and chatting by.  \"How d'ye, boys?\" they said carelessly to the three home-comers. \"Oh, Polly! won't it be entrancing to-night?\" cried one of them, seizing her arm as she spoke.  \"Hush!\" said Polly, as she tried to stop her.  \"May I bring Elsie Fay? she's come on the train to stay over Christmas with her aunt. May I, Polly?\" begged another girl eagerly.  \"Yes, yes,\" said Polly in a paroxysm of fear lest Joel, who was crowding up between them, should catch a word; \"do be still,\" she whispered. \"Bring anybody; only stop, Alexia.\"  \"He won't hear,\" said Alexia carelessly; \"that boy doesn't mind our talking; his head's full of skating and coasting.\"  \"You're going to have something to-night that you don't want me to know about,\" declared Joel, his chubby face set defiantly, and crowding closer; \"so there; now I'm going to find out what it is.\"  \"If we don't want you to know, you ought not to try to find out, Joel Pepper,\" cried Alexia. \"And you shan't, either.\"  \"There, now you see,\" cried Polly, unable to keep still, while her face grew red too. \"O dear! what shall we do?\"  \"You are--you are,\" cried Joel, capering up and down the platform, his black eyes shining with delight. \"Now I know for certain, and it's at our house, too, for you asked Polly if you might bring some other girl, Elsie somebody or other, so! Oh! I'll soon know.\"  \"Joel,\" exclaimed Jasper suddenly, clapping him on the shoulder, \"I'm going round to the gymnasium; want to go with me?\"  Joel stopped his capering at once, this new idea thrusting out the old one.  \"Don't I, though!\" he cried, with a nod at Polly and her friends. \"But I'll find out when I do get home,\" the nod declared plainly.  But Jasper also nodded. He said, \"He won't get home till late; depend on me.\" And then \"Come on, Joe,\" he cried; \"I'm going to walk,\" and they were off.  Alexia pinched Polly's gray woolen jacket sleeve convulsively. \"What an escape,\" she breathed.  \"Here comes Percy,\" cried Polly nervously, and she broke away from her and the other girls, and ran to meet him, and the two boys following.  \"Where's Jasper?\" asked Percy, rendered quite important in air and step, from his encounter with the baggage officials.  \"Oh! he isn't going home with us,\" said Polly. \"Come, do let us get in,\" and she scampered off to the carriage and climbed within.  \"That's funny,\" said Percy, jumping in after.  Van opened his lips to tell where Jasper had gone, but remembering Percy's delight in such an expedition, he closed them quickly, and added himself to the company in the carriage. Davie followed, and closed the door quickly.  \"Stop! where's Joel?\" asked Percy. \"Thomas, we've forgotten Joe,\" rapping on the glass to the coachman.  \"No, we haven't; he isn't going to drive,\" said Polly.  \"Oh!\" and Percy, thinking that Joel had stolen a march on them on his good strong legs, now cried lustily, \"Go on, Thomas; get ahead as fast as you can,\" and presently he was lost in the babel of laughter and chatter going on in the coach.  \"I've a piece of news,\" presently cried Van in a lull. \"Davie's bringing home a prize; first in classics, you know.\"  \"Oh, Davie!\" screamed Polly, and she leaned over to throw her arms around him; \"Mamsie will be so glad. Davie, you can't think how glad she'll be!\"  Davie's brown cheek glowed. \"It isn't much,\" he said simply, \"there were so many prizes given out.\"  \"Well, you've taken one,\" cried Polly, saying the blissful over and over. \"How perfectly elegant!\"  Van drummed on the carriage window discontentedly. \"I could have taken one if I'd had the mind to.\"  \"Hoh-oh!\" shouted Percy over in his corner. \"Well, you didn't have the mind; that's what was wanting.\"  \"You keep still,\" cried Van, flaming up, and whirling away from his window. \"You didn't take any, either. Polly, his head was under water all the time, unless some of the boys tugged him along every day. We hardly got him home at all.\"  \"No such thing,\" contradicted Percy flatly, his face growing red. \"Polly, he tells perfectly awful yarns. You mustn't believe him, Polly, You won't, will you?\" He leaned over appealingly toward her.  \"Oh! don't, don't,\" cried Polly, quite dismayed, \"talk so to each other.\"  \"Well, he's so hateful,\" cried Van, \"and the airs he gives himself! I can't stand them, Polly, you know\"--  \"And he's just as mean,\" cried Percy vindictively. \"Oh! you can't think, Polly. Here we are,\" as Thomas gave a grand flourish through the stone gateway, and up to the steps.  \"I'll help you out,\" and he sprang out first.  \"No, I will,\" declared Van, opening the door on the other side, jumping out and running around the carriage. \"Here, Polly, take my hand,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],["title","Five Little Peppers Midway (#6)"],["body",".\"  \"No, I got here first,\" said Percy eagerly, his brown glove extended quite beyond Van's hand.  \"I don't want any one to help me, who speaks so to his brother,\" said Polly in a low voice, and with her most superb air stepping down alone, she ran up the steps to leave them staring in each other's faces.  Here everybody came hurrying out to the porch, and they were soon drawn into the warm loving welcome awaiting them.  \"Oh, Felicie! I don't want that dress,\" said Polly as she ran into her room after dinner, to Mrs. Whitney's French maid, \"I'm going to wear my brown cashmere.\"  \"Oh, Mademoiselle!\" remonstrated Felicie, adjusting the ruffle in the neck of the white nun's veiling over her arm.  \"Oh, no, Polly! I wouldn't,\" began Mrs. Pepper, coming in, \"the white one is better for to-night.\"  \"Mamsie!\" cried Polly, breaking away from the mirror where she was pulling into place the bright brown waves over her forehead, \"how lovely! you've put on your black silk; and your hair is just beautiful!\"  \"Madame has ze fine hair,\" said Felicie, \"only I wish zee would gif it to me to prepaire.\"  \"Yes, I have good hair,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"and I'm thankful for it. No one looks dressed up, in my opinion, with a ragged head. The finer the gown, the worse it makes careless hair look. No, Polly, I wouldn't wear the brown dress to-night.\"  \"Why, Mamsie!\" exclaimed Polly in surprise, \"I thought you'd say it was just the thing when only the girls and Jappy's friends are coming to the play. Besides, I don't want to look too dressed up; the Princess ought to be the only one in a white gown.\"  \"You won't be too conspicuous,\" said her mother; adding slowly, \"you might wear the nun's veiling well enough as you haven't any part in the play, Polly,\" and she scanned the rosy face keenly.  \"I don't want any part,\" cried Polly; \"they all play better than I do. Somebody must see that everything goes off well behind the scenes; that's my place, Mamsie. Besides, you forget I am to play my sonata.\"  \"I don't forget,\" said her mother; \"all the more reason you should wear the white gown, then.\"  \"All right,\" cried Polly, merrily dashing across the room to Felicie, \"put it over my head, do. Well, I'm glad you think it is right to wear it, Mamsie,\" as the soft folds fell around her. \"I just love this dress. Oh, Auntie! how perfectly exquisite!\"  Mrs. Whitney came in smilingly and put a kiss on the tall girl's cheek. \"Do I look nicely?\" she asked naively, turning around under the chandelier.  \"Nicely?\" exclaimed Polly, lifting her hands, \"why you are fresh from fairyland. You are so good to put on that lovely blue moire and your diamond cross, just for the boys and girls.\"  \"I am glad you like it,\" said Mrs. Whitney hastily. \"Now, Polly, don't you worry about anything; I'll see that the last things are done.\"  \"Well, I am worrying,\" confessed Polly, quite in a tremble; \"I must see to one corner of the private box for the boys. You know the last India shawl you lent me wasn't pinned up straight and I couldn't fix it, for Van wanted me just then, and I couldn't get away without his suspecting something. Oh, Auntie! if you would see to that.\"  \"I will,\" said Mrs. Whitney, not daring to look at Mrs. Pepper, \"and to all the other things; don't give a thought to them, Polly.\"  \"How good you are,\" cried Polly with a sigh of relief. \"Oh, Auntie! we couldn't do anything without you.\"  \"And you don't need to go into the drawing-room at all,\" said Mrs. Whitney, going to the door. \"Just keep behind the scenes, and get your actors and Phronsie ready, and your mother and I will receive your friends. Come, Mrs. Pepper.\"  \"That is splendid,\" cried Polly, left behind with the maid, \"now I can get ready without flying into a flurry, Felicie; and then for Phronsie and the rest!\"  \"There is a dreadful commotion in there among the audience,\" said Jasper, out in the green room; \"I imagine every one who had an 'invite,' has come. But I don't see how they can make such a noise.\"  \"Oh! a few girls and boys make just about as much confusion as a good many,\" observed Polly. \"Jasper, wouldn't you like to see Joel's eyes when Aunt Whitney leads him into the private box?\" she allowed herself time to exclaim. \"Yes,\" laughed Jasper, pulling out his watch from beneath his dragon-skin; \"well, we have only five minutes more, Polly. We must have the curtain up sharp.\"  \"O dear, dear!\" cried Polly, flying here and there to bestow last touches on the different members of her cast. \"Now, Clare, you must remember not to give such a shriek when you go on, mustn't he, Jappy? Just a dull, sullen roar, your part is.\"  \"Well, I'm nearly dead under here,\" cried Clare, glaring beneath his dragon face. \"I'll shriek, or roar, just as I like, so!\"  \"Very well,\" said Polly, \"I don't know but it's as well, after all, that you are cross; you'll be more effective,\" she added coolly. \"Let me see--oh! the door of the cave wants a bit more of gray moss; it looks thin where it hangs over. You get it, will you, Hannah?\" to one of the maids who was helping.  \"And just one thing more,\" scanning hastily the stage setting, \"another Chinese lantern is needed right here,\" going toward the front of the stage, \"and that green bush is tumbling over; do set it straight, somebody; there now, I believe everything is all ready. Now let us peep out of the curtain, and get one good look at the audience. Come, Phronsie, here's a fine place; come, boys!\"  The different members of the cast now applied their eyes to as many cracks in the curtain as could be hastily managed.  There was a breathing space.  \"What, what?\" cried Polly, gazing into the sea of faces, and the dragons nearly knocked the Princess over as Mr. King gave the signal for the band stationed in the wide hall, to send out their merriest strains.     V  AFTER THE PLAY   It was all over. Phronsie had been swept off, a vision of loveliness, to the cave; the dragons had roared their loudest, and the gallant knight had covered himself with glory in the brilliant rescue of the Princess; the little page had won the hearts of all the ladies; Mr. King had applauded himself hoarse, especially during the delivery of the prologue, when \"I cry you mercy, sirs, and ladies fair,\" rang out; the musical efforts of Polly and Jasper in the \"Wait\" between the two acts were over, and the crowded house, in every way possible, had expressed itself delighted with all things from beginning to end.  \"Phronsie, Phronsie, they're calling you,\" whispered Polly excitedly, out in the green room.  \"Come, Princess.\" The head dragon held out his hand. \"Hurry dear! See the flowers!\"  \"They can't be for me,\" said Phronsie, standing quite still; \"Polly has done all the work; they're hers.\"  \"Nonsense, child!\" cried Polly, giving her a gentle push forward. \"Go on, and take them.\"  \"Polly, you come too,\" begged Phronsie, refusing to stir, and holding her by the gown.  \"I can't, Phronsie,\" cried Polly in distress; \"don't you see they haven't called me. Go on, child, if you love me,\" she implored.  Phronsie, not being able to resist this, dropped Polly's gown and floated before the footlights.  \"Thank you,\" she said, bowing gravely to the sea of faces, as her hands were filled with roses, \"but I shall give these to Polly, because we couldn't any of us have done it without her.\" And so she brought them back to put into dismayed Polly's lap.  \"The authors--the authors of the play!\" cried a strong voice, privately urged on by Mr. King.  \"There, now's your turn,\" cried Clare to Polly. \"And go ahead, old dragon,\" to Jasper, \"make your prettiest bow.\"  So the chief dragon led up blushing Polly to the front of the stage, to hear a neat little speech from Mr. Alstyne, thanking them for the pleasure of the evening and congratulating them on its success; and the band played again, the camp chairs were folded up and removed, the green-room and stage were deserted, and actors and audience mingled in a gay, confusing throng.  Phronsie, in her little silver and white gown and gleaming cap, began to wander among the guests, unconscious that she had not on the red cashmere dress she had worn all day. Groups stopped their conversation to take her into their midst, passing her on at last as one might hand over a precious parcel to the next waiting hands. Polly, seeing that she was well cared for, gave herself up to the enjoyment of the evening.  \"Well, sir, how did you like it?\" asked Jasper, with a small pat on Joel's back.  \"Well enough,\" said Joel, \"but why didn't you make more of it? You could have crawled up on top of the cave, and slashed around there; and you old dragons were just three muffs in the last act. I'd rather have had Polly in the play; she's twice the go in her.  \"So would we all have preferred Polly,\" cried Jasper, bursting into a laugh, \"but she wouldn't act--she directed everything; she was all the play, in fact.\"  Polly meanwhile was saying to Pickering Dodge, \"No, not to-night; you must dance with one of the other girls.\"  \"But I don't choose to dance with anybody but you,\" said Pickering, holding out his hand. \"Come, Polly, you can't refuse; they're forming the Lancers. Hurry!\"  Polly's feet twitched nervously under her white gown, and she longed more than ever after the excitement she had passed through, to lose herself in the witching music, and the mazy dance. She hesitated a bit, but just then glancing across the room, \"Come,\" she said, \"I want you to dance with Ray Simmons. You can't refuse,\" using his own words; and before he was conscious how it was done, he was by Ray's side, and asking for the pleasure of the dance.  Polly stood quite still and saw them go away and take the last places in the set, and a sorry little droop fell upon the curves of the laughing mouth. She was very tired, and the elation that had possessed her over the success of the evening was fast dropping out, now that everybody was enjoying themselves in their own way, leaving her alone. She felt left out in the"]]]
