Together they entered; and a moment afterwards, just as Miss Hetty was preparing to lay the cloth for dinner, a knock sounded through the house.  “Goodness!” said Miss Hetty, fluttered. “Who can it be that wants to see me at this hour?”  Smoothing down her apron, and giving a look at the glass to make sure that her hair was in order, she hastened to the door.  “Will it be asking too much, madam, to request a seat by your fire for myself and little girl for a few moments? It is very cold.”  Miss Hetty could feel that it _was_ cold. Somehow, too, the appealing expression of the little girl’s face touched her. So she threw the door wide open, and bade them enter.  Miss Hetty went on preparing the table for dinner. A most delightful odor issued from the oven; one door of which was open, lest the turkey should overdo. Miss Hetty could not help observing the wistful glance cast by the little girl towards the tempting dish as she placed it on the table.  “Poor little creature!” thought she. “I suppose it is a long time since she has had a good dinner.”  Then the thought struck her, “Here I am alone to eat all this. There is quite enough for half a dozen. How much these poor people would relish it!”  By this time the table was arranged.  “Sir,” said she, turning to the traveller, “you look as if you were hungry as well as cold. If you and your little daughter would like to sit up, I should be happy to have you.”  “Thank you, madam!” was the grateful reply. “We are hungry, and shall be much indebted to your kindness.”  It was rather a novel situation for Miss Hetty,—sitting at the head of the table, dispensing food to others beside herself. There was something rather agreeable about it.  “Will you have some of the dressing, little girl? I have to call you that; for I don’t know your name,” she added, in an inquiring tone.  “Her name is Henrietta; but I generally call her Hetty,” said the traveller.  “What!” said Miss Hetty, dropping the spoon in surprise.  “She was named after a very dear friend of mine,” said he, sighing.  “May I ask,” said Miss Hetty, with excusable curiosity, “the name of this friend? I begin to feel quite an interest in your little girl,” she added, half apologetically.  “Her name is Henrietta Henderson,” said the stranger.  “Why, that is my name!” ejaculated Miss Hetty.  “And she was named after you,” said the stranger, composedly.  “Why, who in the world are you?” she asked, her heart beginning to beat unwontedly fast.  “Then you don’t remember me?” said he, rising, and looking steadily at Miss Hetty. “Yet you knew me well in bygone days,—none better. At one time, it was thought you would join your destiny to mine——”  “Nick Anderson!” said Miss Hetty, rising in confusion.  “You are right. You rejected me because you did not feel secure of my principles. The next day, in despair at your refusal, I left the house, and, ere forty-eight hours had passed, was on my way to India. I had not formed the design of going to India in particular; but, in my then state of mind, I cared not whither I went. One resolution I formed,—that I would prove by my conduct that your apprehensions were ill founded. I got into a profitable business. In time, I married; not that I had forgotten you, but that I was solitary, and needed companionship. I had ceased to hope for yours. By and by, a daughter was born. True to my old love, I named her Hetty, and pleased myself with the thought that she bore some resemblance to you. Afterwards my wife died; misfortunes came upon me; and I found myself deprived of all my property. Then came yearnings for my native soil. I have returned (as you see), not as I departed, but poor and care-worn.”  While Nicholas was speaking, Miss Hetty’s mind was filled with conflicting emotions. At length, extending her hand frankly, she said,—  “I feel that I was too hasty, Nicholas. I should have tried you longer. But, at least, I may repair my injustice. I have enough for us all. You shall come and live with me.”  “I can only accept your generous offer on one condition,” said Nicholas.  “And what is that?”  “That you will be my wife!”  A vivid blush came over Miss Hetty’s countenance. She “couldn’t think of such a thing,” she said. Nevertheless, an hour afterwards the two united lovers had fixed upon the marriage-day.         *       *       *       *       *  The house does not look so prim as it used to do. The yard is redolent with many fragrant flowers. The front door is half open, revealing a little girl playing with a kitten.  “Hetty,” says a matronly lady, “you have got the ball of yarn all over the floor. What would your father say if he should see it?”  “Never mind, mother; it was only kitty that did it.”  Marriage has filled up a void in the heart of Miss Hetty. Though not so prim, or perhaps careful, as she used to be, she is a good deal happier. Three hearts are filled with thankfulness at every return of MISS HENDERSON’S THANKSGIVING DAY.     LITTLE CHARLIE.       A violet grew by the river-side,       And gladdened all hearts with its bloom;     While over the fields, on the scented air,       It breathed a rich perfume.     But the clouds grew dark in the angry sky,       And its portals were opened wide;     And the heavy rain beat down the flower       That grew by the river-side.      Not far away, in a pleasant home,       There lived a little boy,     Whose cheerful face and childish grace       Filled every heart with joy.     He wandered one day to the river’s verge,       With no one near to save;     And the heart that we loved with a boundless love       Was stilled in the restless wave.      The sky grew dark to our tearful eyes,       And we bade farewell to joy;     For our hearts were bound by a sorrowful tie       To the grave of the little boy.     The birds still sing in the leafy tree       That shadows the open door:     We heed them not; for we think of the voice       That we shall hear no more.      We think of him at eventide,       And gaze on his vacant chair     With a longing heart, that will scarce believe       That Charlie is not there.     We seem to hear his ringing laugh,       And his bounding step at the door;     But, alas! there comes the sorrowful thought,—       We shall never hear them more!      We shall walk sometimes to his little grave,       In the pleasant summer hours;     We will speak his name in a softened voice,       And cover his grave with flowers;     We will think of him in his heavenly home,—       His heavenly home so fair;     And we will trust with a hopeful trust       That we shall meet him there.     BERTHA’S CHRISTMAS VISION.   It was the night before Christmas. Snow was falling without; and the wind dashed the cold flakes, in eddying whirls, into the faces of those wayfarers whom business or pleasure kept out thus late. They drew their warm garments more closely about them, and hurried onward; little heeding the pelting of the storm while the vision of a cheerful hearth and a merry family circle danced before their eyes and warmed their hearts. Merry St. Nicholas, too, the patron saint of children, was abroad. It was a busy night with him. Thousands of parcels must be made up, and showered down as many chimneys into expectant stockings, before the morrow’s dawn. So he gives the reins to his coursers, and speeds swiftly along,—                              “through forest and brake;     Through deep, drifting snow; over river and lake;     Over hill, over dale, where the keen northern blast,     With fierce, angry moaning, drives fearfully past.”  In a large and pleasant room sat little Bertha, gazing thoughtfully into the fire. The fire crackled and burnt; and shadows, cast by its flickering light, danced on the wall. But little Bertha’s thoughts were far away, and she heeded them not. For many weeks, she had been looking forward to this very night; and now she was trying to conjecture what gifts good St. Nicholas had in store for her. At length she grew weary of conjecture, took a lamp from the table, and went up stairs to bed. It was a neat little chamber; and the counterpane on Bertha’s bed rivalled in whiteness the falling snow without. Bertha looked out of the window, against the panes of which the snow was beating noisily.  “It is a cold night,” thought she. “St. Nicholas will have a hard time of it. What if he should not come at all?”  Bertha’s apprehensions were soon dispelled; for, as she looked out, the sound of silvery bells came nearer and nearer, till at length it paused under her window, and, a moment afterwards, was heard in an opposite direction. Bertha rubbed her eyes, and strove to distinguish the sleigh from which these sounds proceeded; but she could distinguish nothing.  “Can it be St. Nicholas?” thought she.  Even as she spoke, mingling with the sound of the retreating bells, she thought she could distinguish the words of a song. She listened attentively; and these were the words which the wind bore to her:—      “The path I have chosen       Is covered with snow;     The streams are all frozen;       Yet onward I go.      “I glide o’er the mountain,       And skim o’er the lea;     I pass by the fountain;       Yet no eye can see—      “My form or my shadow       On snow-drift or mound,     On hill-top or meadow,       Or frost-spangled ground.      “While sleigh-bells are ringing       Upon the highway,     And glad parties singing       So thoughtless and gay,—      “I pass through and over       Each hamlet and hall     Ere mortals discover       Who gave them a call.      “I pause but to count o’er       The gifts for each one,     And then quickly mount o’er       The stile. I am gone!”  “That must certainly be Santa Claus,” thought Bertha. So she carefully"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56222"],["title","Bertha's Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf (#5)"],["body"," up her stockings before the fire, and went to bed. She soon became tired of waiting for St. Nicholas to come; and, in a few minutes, she was asleep. But the thoughts of Christmas had taken fast hold of her mind, and, as she slept, shaped themselves into the following dream:—  She thought, that, as she was lying awake in her chamber, there appeared suddenly before her three figures, clad in white. Slowly they advanced, hand in hand, till they stood before her bedside. Then, with united voices, they chanted the following lines:—      “Maiden, from the fields of air       We have winged our rapid flight,     Bringing gifts both rich and rare,       On this frosty Christmas night.     Guard them ever: they will be     Of exceeding worth to thee.”  They ceased; and Bertha, in great astonishment, inquired,—  “What! are you St. Nicholas? Or,” she added, recollecting herself, “perhaps you are his sisters?”  The visitors resumed their chant:—      “Maiden, no! Thy Christmas saint     Beareth gifts of mortal taint:     At the touch of sure decay     They shall vanish quite away.     Those we bear are not of earth:     Theirs has been a higher birth.”  The visitors ceased; and one of their number, coming forward, commenced anew:—      “I am Faith. To thee I bear       Childlike trust and confidence     In the ever-watchful care       Of our Father’s providence.     Maiden, one of sisters three,     This the gift I bear to thee.”  The second came forward, and repeated:—      “I am Hope. When darksome clouds       Gather round thy earthly way,     And Misfortune’s shadowy veil       Intercepts the light of day,     I will come on wings of light:       Clouds and mist shall straightway fly,     And reveal the golden gates       Of a happier home on high.     Maiden, one of sisters three,     This the gift I bear to thee.”  Smiling graciously on the wondering Bertha, Hope drew back, and gave place to her sister, who commenced as follows:—      “I am Charity. Let me       Ever on thy steps attend,     And, as long as life shall last,       Be thy counsellor and friend.     In thy bosom I would sow       Seeds of gentleness and love,     And, a resident of earth,       Fit thee for a home above.     Maiden, last of sisters three,     This the gift I bear to thee.”  Again the sisters joined hands, and, with united voices, chanted, as at first,—      “Maiden, from the fields of air       We have winged our rapid flight,     Bringing gifts both rich and rare,       On this frosty Christmas night.     Faith and Hope and Charity!     Earthly maiden, sisters three,     These the gifts we bear to thee.”  Their voices died away, and they were gone. Bertha opened her eyes, and, lo! it was all a vision that had come to her on this Christmas night. The morning sun was shining brightly through the window-panes. Noisily over the frozen snow dashed the sleighs; and their bells rang a merry peal in honor of Christmas Day. Bertha glanced at the well-filled stockings that hung in front of the fire, and then she knew that St. Nicholas had been there with his budget of gifts; and the words sung by the sisters came into her mind:—      “Maiden, no! Thy Christmas saint     Beareth gifts of mortal taint.     Those we bear are not of earth:     Theirs has been a higher birth.”  “I will not forget the gifts of the good sisters,” she murmured softly. “Doubtless it is my heavenly Father who has sent them to me.”  So it was that little Bertha, attended by the three sisters, walked peacefully and happily through life.  The ways of God’s providence, so dark and mysterious to many, became plain and clear to her; for she saw with the eye of Faith. Clouds sometimes gathered about her path; but Hope waved her wand, and they were at once dispelled. Jealousy and envy and angry thoughts disturbed her not; for her heart was filled with the heavenly spirit of Charity.  Would that we all might be blessed with Bertha’s Christmas vision!     WIDE-AWAKE.   Many years ago, in a city whose name I cannot now recall, there lived a poor woman, whose husband had died, leaving nothing but a little son. For some time, she continued to support herself, and her son, whom she dearly loved, by working early and late at the spinning-wheel. But, after a while, a heavy misfortune fell upon her: it was no less than the loss of eyesight. So she was obliged to give up her spinning; for now she could distinguish neither the web nor the woof. You can imagine her distress at being deprived so suddenly of seeing the great and beautiful spectacle of fields, flowers, and sky, which every day presents to our gaze. Still, she would not have heeded all this; but she found herself cut off, at the same time, from all means of subsistence.  Meanwhile, her son had grown up into a stout, active boy of twelve. He was full of life and animation; and that, I suppose, was the reason he had received the name of “Wide-awake.” Now, little Wide-awake had a kind heart as well as manly spirit; and when he saw that his mother, who had worked so hard and so long for him, had become blind, he said to himself, “Now it is my turn to work.”  So he told his mother that he was going to seek for work, and that, after three months, he would faithfully return. But first he sold the spinning-wheel, which was no longer of any use, and one or two other articles, and gave the money to a neighbor, who promised to spend it for his mother as she had need. Then he took a cheerful leave of his mother, and went off with a light heart, though his pockets were empty.  He had not walked far when he overtook an old woman, who was bending beneath the weight of a heavy burden. She was homely, and appeared very tired. Wide-awake was passing by, when she called out to him, “Come here, little boy: help me to carry this bundle. I am old, weak, and tired; you are young and strong.”  Wide-awake was very obliging; and, though the old woman’s tone was not the pleasantest in the world, he very willingly took one side of the bundle, and helped her to carry it. The day was hot, and the bundle heavy; but he bore up stoutly, so that the old woman began to get over her ill humor, and to ask him some questions. So he told her his whole story,—how his mother was blind and unable to work, and he was seeking his fortune.  “Well,” said the old woman, “if that is the case, I think you had better come and live with me. I live in a little cottage not far off, and am in want of a boy to go on errands and do other little things for me. If you will come and stay with me three months, I will reward you as you deserve. But I will warn you that I am very particular, and shall require you to obey me in every thing.”  Of course, Wide-awake was only too glad to accept the old woman’s offer. He was quite sure that he should be able to suit her; and he could not help picturing to himself how glad his mother would be to have him return with perhaps a piece of gold; for this seemed a great sum to Wide-awake, and a very generous compensation for three months’ labor.  After a while, they came to the old woman’s cottage. It was a small house, containing three rooms. One of these was a kitchen, in which the old woman did all her cooking; another was her chamber; and the third she told Wide-awake he should have to sleep in.  Early the next morning, the old woman came to his bedside, and shook him roughly.  “Up! up!” said she. “Is not the sun up? and you are lying here asleep! What is your name?”  “Wide-awake,” said he, rubbing his eyes.  “Then,” said the old woman, “hereafter, be sure to be wide awake before the sun. Dress yourself as quickly as possible, and I will give you your breakfast; and then to work.”  Wide-awake was up and dressed in a moment. The old woman set before him a bowl of bread and milk for his breakfast. After he had eaten this, she took him to a fold near by, where he saw ten beautiful sheep.  “These,” said she, “will be your care. You will drive them to the great meadow a mile hence, and watch them, taking care that none stray away. Three times a day—at morning, noon, and night—you will drive them to the spring, and let them drink; and, at seven o’clock, you may bring them back.”  Wide-awake promised faithfully to obey her in every respect. He found the great meadow without difficulty. He watched the sheep, and watered them, as he had been directed, and, at nightfall, drove them home. The old woman counted the sheep, and, finding them all there, was well content, and gave Wide-awake his supper.  So time passed on. Every day the old woman became better satisfied with Wide-awake, who, on his part, was looking forward to the time when he might go home.  One morning about this time, as Wide-awake was about to drive out his sheep as usual, the old woman stopped him.  “They have grown quite fat,” said she; “so I shall carry them to the city and sell them. I shall be gone a week, and shall leave you here to take care of the house while I am gone. You will not have much to do. But there is one thing I must warn you against: you must not, on any account, open the door of the closet which is in your chamber. If you do, you will repent it.”  Wide-awake was not troubled with curiosity; and so he found no difficulty in making this promise.  The old woman departed, and Wide-awake was left alone. Having nothing else to do, he began to think of home and his mother. Then he began to wonder how much his mistress meant to give him for his services. He determined that he would buy a nice arm-chair for his mother, and a great many other things, if his money only held out. But they were all for his mother’s comfort, and not for his own, as I have already explained that Wide-awake was far from being selfish.  On the fourth day after the old woman’s departure, a stout man came to the door, and asked leave to rest a little while. Wide-awake knew that his mistress would have no objection; so he gave him permission, and, moreover, placed before him some bread and milk. The man "]]]
