When the meaning is, there is, it is, _nia_ is preceded by _e_: _na liqa gera enia ada_ they have their holes; _ma te ai enia i luma_ there is only one person in the house; with _na_ demonstrative added: _nia na_ that is it, that is so.  4. The form _ni_ is seen in _nifai_ what? where? It occurs in certain phrases as meaning, it is, there is: _e uta ro si lio ni agamu_ how is it ye are of two minds? _na light fuana noni ni maa_ the light of the body it is the eye.  5. The plural sign _gi_ is used with the forms in the plural but not with those ending in _lu_: _gia gi fi dao na_ we have just come.  6. The forms in the plural third _igera_ and _gera_ are used as equivalent to a plural article: _igera na judea_ the Jews.  7. The pronouns of the third person singular and plural may be used of impersonal or inanimate things.  B.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO VERBS OR TO PREPOSITIONS AS OBJECT.  Singular: (1) _nau_. (2) _oe_. (3) _a_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.   Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_.              (3) _gera_, _da_, _dalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _goro_.   Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _daro_.  1. Examples of usage are, _gera saegera sui_ they were all summoned, _nia lea fonosia_ he went to get it. A second object of the verb always appears in the suffixed pronoun singular and plural third: _gu langi si adasia na ola_ I did not see a canoe, _gera gutafigera na mwane gi_ they persecuted the men.  All prepositions governing nouns have the pronoun suffixed as an anticipatory object in agreement with the noun: _gera lea fonosia fera_ they went to harm the land, _fafia si doo_ concerning the matter.  2. The verb _dori_ (to wish) has the pronoun suffixed where in Sa'a none would be used: _nia langi si doria gwou ana_ he would not drink (it) of it.  3. To _taifili_ (alone) the pronouns are suffixed: _te taifilia_ he alone, _taifiligera_ they alone.  C.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO NOUNS OR TO VERBAL NOUNS USED AS PREPOSITIONS.  Singular: (1) _gu_. (2) _mu_. (3) _na_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.   Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_. (3) _gera_, _da_, _dalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _goro_.   Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _dar   1. These are the pronouns denoting possession and they are suffixed to a certain class of nouns only, those which denote names of parts of the body, or of family relationship, or of things in close relationship to the possessor.  In all other cases possession is denoted by the use of the ordinary personal pronouns.  2. When things and not persons are in question _ni_ is used in place of _da_ in plural third: _lea alua i fulini_ go and put them in their places.  3. Of the plural forms those ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in the number of the persons concerned.  4. These pronouns are also suffixed to the preposition _fua_ to, used as a dative, to _afuta_ all, and to certain other words which show a noun termination but which have no independent existence as nouns: _otofa_ concerning, _oofa_ approaching to, enceinte, _sie_, at the house of (in the vocabulary all such words are followed by a hyphen); also to _mara_ of one's own accord, alone, _te taifilia marana_ he alone; also to the verb _too_ to hit, _toogu_, _toona_, hit me, etc.   DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.  These are _na_, _ne_, this; _nena_, _nana_, _nane_, that.  1. These all follow a noun or a pronoun: _a mwela ne_ this person, _nia nana_ that is it.  2. _Na_ is added after the negative _langi_: _langi na no_, not that; and after _sui_ finished: _sui na_ that is finished.  3. _Go_ an adverb, there, is used as a demonstrative: _tefe doo go ana_ only one thing, _inau go agu_ I for my part; _ne_ may be added, _gone_ that, _inia gone_ that is so. _Ba_ means that, there: _diena ba_ good! _bago_ is used following a noun or a pronoun: _a doo bago_ that person there.   INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.  1. The words used are _ati_, who; _taa, tafa_, what. The personal article _a_ makes _ati_ who, singular, _gerati_ plural.  Both _ti_ and _taa_ are nouns. The adverb _ba_ may be added to _ati_ for the purpose of emphasis: _ati ba_ who? _Ti_ stands for the name of the person and _ati_ means, what is the name? _ati mwane_ what man? The demonstrative _ne_ may be added for emphasis: _ati ne_ who is it then? _Ati_ has also an indefinite use: _ati susulia_ who knows?  2. With _taa_, _tafa_, the definite article _si_ may be used: _si taa_ what, that which, _taa_ may follow the noun, _ta si doo taa_ what sort of thing? _si doo taa ne_ what? The adverb _fai_ (where) may be used as an interrogative pronoun: _nifai_ which, what?   INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.  The uses of _ta_, _te__, have been dealt with under \"articles.\" These two words are used as signifying, any, some, other.  The noun _sai_ place, thing, has an indefinite use: _sai ai_ that which, what, _sai na_ that which, _ta sai ai_, one, another (of things), _sai oe_ your place, your duty, _tani oto ni sai ai_ some people. (The Rev. A. I. Hopkins states in a note that _sai_ in Lau is used of food only).   RELATIVE PRONOUNS.  There are no relative pronouns. Their place is supplied by various locutions.  1. By the suffixed pronoun: _inia nane gu bae kekerofana fasi uri_ this is he of whom I spoke. The addition of the demonstrative _ne, nena_, serves to make the meaning clearer: _inia nena ai garni mi maasia_ he is the person for whom we are waiting.  2. By making use of a coordinate clause: _igami ne too gera ada fuada na_ we are the people whom they have chosen.   POSSESSIVES.  Singular: (1) _agu_. (2) _amu_. (3) _ana_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _aga_, _agolu_.   Exclusive: (1) _agami_, _agamelu_. (2) _agamu_, _agamolu_.              (3) _agera_, _ada_, _adalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _agoro_.   Exclusive: (1) _agamere_. (2) _agamoro_. (3) _adaro_.  The possessive is used:  1. Of things to eat and drink: _si fangala agu_ something for me to eat, _o ngalia amu_ take it for your eating, _si doo ana gera priest tafiligera_ food for the priests only.  When the sense relates to food in general and not to a particular meal the ordinary personal pronouns are employed as possessives: _si doo ni gwou inau_ a drink for me.  2. As meaning, for me, for my part, etc., belonging to, at, with: _geni agu_ a wife for me, _nia lea ana_ he went his way, _gu ka gele dau go agu_ if I but touch, _fuana ngalia fera nia agolu_ to get his land for ourselves, _si mamana nia ana_ power in himself, his power, _si doo oro agu_ I have many things, _e langi ana_ not in it, lost, _nia soe agera_ he questioned them, _soea satana ana a doo bago_ ask so-and-so his name, _nia ledia tasi doo agu_ he asked me about something, _ooganga agera_ their debt.  3. As the object of a neuter verb (i. e., a verb which does not take a transitive suffix): _gera da qele ana_ they marvelled at him, _gu ingo amu_ I beseech thee, _dau agu_ touch me, _bota ana_ blessed is he.  4. With verbs when the object is separated from the verb: _nia bubu tete adalu_ he regarded them fixedly, _ka lugatai saufini ana_ let him go secretly, _da bae aisile ana_ they spoke scornfully of him: _ala meme gamu_ to bite and rend you, is a variant.  5. To express, of, from, among: _ati mwane agamu_ what man of you?  6. The forms ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in the number of the people concerned.  7. The adverb _afoa_ apart is also followed by the possessive: _afoa ana_ apart from him.  8. It will be seen that the one possessive in Lau does the work of the three that are used in Sa'a.   A Port Adam man asking for a wife at Sa'a and saying _geni ana_ (as has happened at times) would be asked whether he wanted to eat her--the Sa'a use being _keni nana_, _'ana_ being reserved of things to eat.   ADJECTIVES.  1. Words which are qualifying terms may also be used in the form of verbs, but some may be used without verbal particles and follow the qualified word. _Mwane baita_ a big man, _mwela tou_ a little child.  2. Some words have a form which is used only of adjectives, either of termination or of prefix.  a. Adjectival terminations are: _a_, _la_.  The termination _a_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _rodo_ night, _rorodoa_ dark, darkness, cloud; _bulu_ to be black, _bubulua_ black.  _La_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _mwai_ a bag, _mwaila_ rich, _kobu_ to be fat, _kobukobula_ fat, whole, big; _tagalo_ to be wandering, _tagalola_ matted, thick, of forest.  b. Adjectival prefixes are _a_, _ma_, _tata_, _m_. These are all prefixed to verbs.  The _a_ is prefixed to verbs to form participles: _luga_ to loose, _aluga_ loose; _la_ to lift up, _alaa_ upwards, up.  _Ma_ denotes condition: _lingi_ to pour, _malingi_ spilled, _ngi_ to divide, _mangisingisi_ broken, divided, _matala_ only, merely; _tefe mwela matala_ an only child.  _Tata_ denotes spontaneity: _tatagwelu_ headlong.  _M_ as a prefix appears to be used in the word _moi_ broken, (Sa'a _'o'i_ to break, _ma'o'i_ broken).  3. Comparison: Degrees of comparison are shown by the use of prepositions or adverbs, or by a simple positive statement. The prepositions used are _fasi_ from, _tasa_ beyond, in excess. The suffixed pronoun is used with _fasi_, but the possessive is used with _tasa_: _na boso nia baita fasia na asufe_ a pig is larger than a rat; _gera baita tasa agera_ these are much larger than those.  The adverbs employed are _gele_ little, somewhat, _asia_ very, too much: _nia baita asia_ it is very (too) large.  A positive statement carries comparison by implication: _doo ne nia baita_ that is biggest, _sai ai ne ni diena, sai ai nena ni taa na_ this is good, that is bad; i.e., this is better than that.   VERBS.  Almost any word may be used as a verb by prefixing the verbal particles, but some words are naturally verbs as being the names of actions and not of things. There are also verbs which have special forms as such by means of a prefix or termination. Verbal particles precede"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],["title","Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#3)"],["body"," verb; they have a temporal force.  1. The verbal particles are _ka_, _ko_. The particles are written apart from the verb, but the speakers like to join them to the governing pronouns of the first and second persons singular, _gu_, _o_.  _Ka_ is used both of present and of future time: _nia ka bae uri_ he speaks thus, _ka urina_ if that be so, _tasi doo taa gera ka odea_ what will they do? _lelea ka rodo_ go till nightfall; the illatives _fi_, _fe_, may be added.  _Ko_ is used only with the personal pronoun, second singular _o_, and may express either present or future time: the illative may be added.  The preposition _fuana_ to him, to it, in order that, is used as a subjunctive or optative.  2. Time and Moods: A subjunctive is formed by _ana_ if, when, followed by the particle _ka_, or by the use of _saea_.  Conditional affirmation is expressed by _saumala_.  The illatives are _fi_ and _fe_, and mean, then, in that case, following upon, just now, for the first time: _ta ka fi uri_ then said he, _gami mifi saitamana na tala uta_ and how shall we know the way?  _Fe_ as an illative denotes, in that case, following upon; _fe_ is also used like _ha'i_ in Sa'a, to denote repetition or continuance or restoration: _na abana e fe boeboela lau_ his hand was restored whole again, _gera ka fe dao toona_ they will certainly reach him, _daro fe lea lau_ go they went on again, _da tefe bae ana tesi baela_ they all cried out together.  _Na_ is used following the verb to form a preterit: _nia mae na_ he is dead. Finality is shown by the use of _sui_: _sui na_ it is all finished, _nia kafi dao sui na_ when he shall have arrived, _sui nana_ it is finished, _sui ta_ thereupon, after that.  For the imperative the simple verb is used: _o lea amu_ go away; _fasi_ may be added for politeness: _lea fasi amu_ you go!  3. Negative Particles: The foregoing particles are not used in negative sentences. The negative particles are _langi_, _e langi_, _si_. These may be combined: _nia langi si saea_ he does not know it, _e langi mu si rongoa ma e langi mu si saea_ you have neither heard it nor seen it, _e langi nau gu si lea_ I am not going, _e langi uri ta ai e adasia_ no one has seen it, _e langi asia_ not at all. The verbal particle _ka_ may be used in negative sentences with the addition of _si_, _kasi bobola_ it is not fitting. The dehortative and the negative imperative is _fasia_: _fasia oko lea_ do not go! _fasia gera ka adasia_ let them not see it, _o fasia oko luia_ do not forbid it.  Genitives: _ni_, _i_ are used to express purpose.  4. Suffixes to verbs: There are certain terminations which, when added to neuter verbs or to verbs active only in a general way, make them definitely transitive or determine their action upon some object. These are of two forms:  a. A consonant with _i_: _fi_, _li_, _mi_, _ni_, _ngi_, _si_, or _i_ by itself; e.g. _tau_, _taufi_; _mae_, _maeli_: _ano_, _anomi_; _mou_, _mouni_; _sau_, _saungi_; _ada_, _adasi_; _manatat_, _manatai_; to the verb _taa_ to be bad, both _si_ and _li_ are added and the causative _fa_ is prefixed: _fataasi_, _fataali_, to make worse. Certain verbs which are active in Lau are neuter in Sa'a: _angai_ to lift, _angaia_ lift it, Sa'a _angainia_; _faodo_ to straighten, _faodoa_ straighten it, Sa'a _ha'aodohie_; _famae_ to kill, _famaea_, Sa'a _ha'amaesie_; _famou_ to frighten, _famoua_, Sa'a _ ha'ama'usie_.  b. The termination _ai_ is suffixed by itself to nouns to convert them into verbs, _sato_, _satoai_. When this syllable _ai_ is suffixed to verbs the genitive _ni_ may be added, and to the form _aini_ the consonants f, m, ng, t, are prefixed: _oli_ to return, _olifaini_ to carry back, _ala_ to answer, _alamaini_ to consent, _sau_ to become, _saungaini_ to make, _tagala_ lost, _tagalangaini_ to drive out, _foaa_ to pray, _foaataini_ to pray for. The forms in _ai_ are also used intransitively: _tege_ to fall, _tegelai_ lost, _oli_ to turn, _olitai_ converted.  The genitive _ni_ (cf. M. L., p. 532) is often omitted and is not invariably used as it is in Sa'a, since the form _ai_ without the addition of _ni_ is transitive: _gonitai_ to receive, _gwoutai_ or _gwoutaini_ to be left alone, _oalangai_ to apportion, _fatolamai_ to command.  _Ani_ appears to be used by itself as a transitive suffix: _ui_ to throw, _uiani_ to throw away, _laga_ to drive, _lagaani_ to drive away, _taba_ to strike, _tabaani_ to destroy; _ani_ is used also with _too_ to hit, _tooani_ to understand.  With either class of suffixes there is no difference in meaning between one suffix and another.  5. Prefixes to verbs: These are causative and reciprocal.  The causative is _fa_: it may be prefixed to almost any word, and it may be used with words which have a transitive suffix. The use of _fa_ frequently obviates the use of a transitive suffix and of itself makes verbs transitive.  The reciprocal is _qai_: generally when _qai_ is prefixed to a verb the action of the verb is enlarged and the subject is included. The illative _fe_ also marks repetition or restoration or continuance; it is followed by the adverb _lau_ again: _na abana e fe boeboela lau_ his hand was restored whole.  6. Passive: The passive is expressed by the use of the personal pronoun plural third _gera_ or _da_, with the verb and the adverb _na_ already: _gera taufia na_ it has been washed; _gera_ and _da_ are used impersonally. The word _saetana_ it is said, _sae_ to say, is used as a passive: _se doo saetana_ the thing said, _si baela ne saetana uri_ the word which was said.  7. Auxiliary verbs: _Alu_ to put, is used as meaning, to be, to become; _talae_, v. tr. to begin, means also to become; _sau_ to make, with the possessive _ana, sau ana_ to become.  8. Reflexive verb: The word _mara_ with suffixed pronoun is used to denote reflexive action: _nia saungia marana_.  It also carries the meaning self, of one's own accord: _i bobongi ka manata tetea ana marana_ the morrow can take care of itself.  9. Reduplication: Verbs are reduplicated in two ways: (a) by reduplication of the first syllable: _liu_, _liliu_; _bae_, _babae_; (b) by repetition of the whole word: _gwou_, _gwougwou_.  There is no difference between the various forms beyond an intensification in meaning. In the vocabulary the reduplicated form is presented under the entry of the stem.   ADVERBS.  There are pure adverbs in Lau, but many words used as adverbs are truly nouns and others are verbs; adjectives may also occur in this employment.  1. Adverbs of place: _mai_ here, hither; go there, thither, _ne_ may be added, gone, also _langi_ go, no. _Lo_ there, is compounded with _go_ and _gi_, _logo_ north, west; _se_ here, a noun, _i se_, _isena_, here, in this place, _gula_ place, a noun: _si gula na_ this place, here, _gula i maa_ outside. _bali_ side, a noun, _bali ne_ here, on this side; _i bali jordan i bali logo_ on the far side of Jordan; _ifai_ where, _gamu mai ifai_ whence are you? _tau_, a verb, far off: _alaa_ up, south, east, _ilangi_, _ifafo_, up.  2. Adverbs of time: _kada na_ (_ne_), _manga na_, now; _si manga, kademanga_, when, _i kademanga na_ (_ne_), at the time when; _i angita, si manga uta_, when? _inao_ of old, in the past; _ua mai inao_ from of old; _isingana ne_ henceforth: _alua fasi_, _taraina_, presently; _urii_ just now; _lau, _lau go_, again; _oli_ back; _na_, _ua na_, already; _ua_ yet, still, still left; _ua go i uarodo_ while still dark in the early morning; _ua mai ana lua_ from the flood, _toongi ua inao_ old clothes, _e langi ua_ not yet, still wanting; _firi_, _tefou_, always; _too ka tau_ forever; _suli dangifiri_ daily; _taraina_ to-day; _i rogi_ yesterday; _maaedangi i fafo_ day before yesterday; _bobongi_ to-morrow; _taraina lao rodo_ to-night; _talae_ first; _loulou_ quick; _aliali_ forthwith; _maasia_, _kade manga_, while.  3. Adverbs of manner: _alafana_ as, like, as if; _uri_, _uria_, _sae_, _saea_, that (of quotation); _uri_, _urina_, thus; _e uta_ how?  _gele_ somewhat; _asia_ completely, too much; _saumala_ granted that; _falaete, mamaloni_, only; _ooni_ merely; _talai_ for no reason; _tefou_ together; _afui_ altogether (precedes verb); _boro_, _oto_, _otomone_, _tamone_, _bota ana_, perhaps; _mone_ gives life, _ba_ gives force, to the narrative; _ba_ also explains and makes the diction less abrupt; _tasa_, _tasaana_, too much; _faoroa_ often.   PREPOSITIONS.  1. Simple prepositions.  Locative, _i_.     Motion to, _fua_, _isuli_, _suli_.     Motion from, _fasi_, _ita_.     Causation, _fafi_.     Position, _fonosi_.  Dative, _fua_.     Instrumental, _ana_, _ani_.     Relation, _ana_, _ani_, _fai_, _sai_, _usi_.     Gentive, _ni_, _i_.  The locative _i_ is seen in _ifai_ where; it is also largely used with adverbs of place and time and it precedes every name of place. With the exception of the locative, the instrumental, the genitive, and also _ana_, _ita_, _usi_, all the foregoing prepositions are used with a suffixed pronoun; _ita_ is used with the possessive.  _Isuli_ denotes motion after, motion over: _sulia rodo ma na asua_ day and night, _manata suli_ to know.  _Fafi_ means, about, concerning, because of, around, on: _gera ogu fafia_ they crowded round him, _nia alua abana fafia_ he laid his hand on him, _lau fafi_ to rescue, _fafi taa_ what about, why; _fuana_ in order that, _mae fuana_ to die to his disadvantage, _soe ledia fuana_ question him about it, _bae fuana_ forbid him, _fuana taa_ wherefore?  Of the two instrumental prepositions _ana_ is the one in more general use, its meaning is with: _doo gera saungia ana_ the thing they killed him with. _Ana_ appears to denote the actual instrument, _ani_ the method of action; _ani_ may be translated withal. When the noun denoting the instrument is not preceded by an article or when the noun is used in a general sense, _ani_ is used in the place of _ana_: _suu fafia ani taa_ to clothe himself with what? _lea ani ola_ to go by canoe.  The pronoun _a_ may be suffixed to _ani_; _tasi doo "]]]
