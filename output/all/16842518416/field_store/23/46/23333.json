There were other means of earning a living, to be sure, but Wayneboro was an agricultural town mainly, and unless he hired out on a farm there seemed no way open to him, while the little sewing his mother might be able to procure would probably pay her less than a dollar a week.  The blow fell sooner than he expected. In the course of the next week Mrs. Carr was notified that Ebenezer Graham had been appointed her successor, and she was directed to turn over the papers and property of the office to him.  She received the official notification by the afternoon mail, and in the evening she was favored by a call from her successor.  Ebenezer Graham was a small man, with insignificant, mean-looking features, including a pair of weazel-like eyes and a turn-up nose. It did not require a skillful physiognomist to read his character in his face. Meanness was stamped upon it in unmistakable characters.  “Good-evening, Mr. Graham,” said the widow, gravely.  “Good-evening, ma'am,” said the storekeeper. “I've called to see you, Mrs. Carr, about the post office, I presume you have heard--”  “I have heard that you are to be my successor.”  “Just so. As long as your husband was alive, I didn't want to step into his shoes.”  “But you are willing to step into mine,” said Mrs. Carr, smiling faintly.  “Just so--that is, the gov'ment appear to think a man ought to be in charge of so responsible a position.”  “I shall be glad if you manage the office better than I have done.”  “You see, ma'am, it stands to reason that a man is better fitted for business than a woman,” said Ebenezer Graham, in a smooth tone for he wanted to get over this rather awkward business as easily as possible. “Women, you know, was made to adorn the domestic circles, et cetery.”  “Adorning the domestic circle won't give me a living,” said Mrs. Carr, with some bitterness, for she knew that but for the grasping spirit of the man before her she would have been allowed to retain her office.  “I was comin' to that,” said the new postmaster. “Of course, I appreciate your position as a widder, without much means, and I'm going to make you an offer; that is, your boy, Herbert.”  Herbert looked up from a book he was reading, and listened with interest to hear the benevolent intentions of the new postmaster.  “I am ready to give him a place in my store,” proceeded Ebenezer. “I always keep a boy, and thinks I to myself, the wages I give will help along the widder Carr. You see, I like to combine business with consideration for my feller creeters.”  Mrs. Carr smiled faintly, for in spite of her serious strait she could not help being amused at the notion of Ebenezer Graham's philanthropy.  “What's going to become of Tom Tripp?” asked Herbert, abruptly.  “Thomas Tripp isn't exactly the kind of boy I want in my store,” said Mr. Graham. “He's a harum-scarum sort of boy, and likes to shirk his work. Then I suspect he stops to play on the way when I send him on errands. Yesterday he was five minutes longer than he need to have been in goin' to Sam Dunning's to carry some groceries. Thomas doesn't seem to appreciate his privileges in bein' connected with a business like mine.”  Tom Tripp was hardly to blame for not recognizing his good luck in occupying a position where he received a dollar and a half a week for fourteen hours daily work, with half a dozen scoldings thrown in.  “How do you know I will suit you any better than Tom?” asked Herbert, who did not think it necessary to thank Mr. Graham for the proffered engagement until he learned just what was expected of him, and what his pay was to be.  “You're a different sort of a boy,” said Ebenezer, with an attempt at a pleasant smile. “You've been brought up different. I've heard you're a smart, capable boy, that isn't afraid of work.”  “No, sir, I am not, if I am fairly paid for my work.”  The new postmaster's jaw fell, and he looked uneasy, for he always grudged the money he paid out, even the paltry dollar and a half which went to poor Tom.  “I always calkerlate to pay fair wages,” he said; “but I ain't rich, and I can't afford to fling away money.”  “How much do you pay Tom Tripp?” asked Herbert.  He knew, but he wanted to draw Mr. Graham out.  “I pay Thomas a dollar and fifty cents a week,” answered the storekeeper, in a tone which indicated that he regarded this, on the whole, as rather a munificent sum.  “And he works from seven in the morning till nine o'clock at night,”  proceeded Herbert.  “Them are the hours,” said Ebenezer, who knew better how to make money than to speak grammatically.  “It makes a pretty long day,” observed Mrs. Carr.  “So it does, ma'am, but it's no longer than I work myself.”  “You get paid rather better, I presume.”  “Of course, ma'am, as I am the proprietor.”  “I couldn't think of working for any such sum,” said Herbert, decidedly.  Mr. Graham looked disturbed, for he had reasons for desiring to secure Herbert, who was familiar with the routine of post-office work.  “Well,” he said, “I might be able to offer you a leetle more, as you know how to tend the post office. That's worth somethin'! I'll give you--lemme see--twenty-five cents more; that is, a dollar and seventy-five cents a week.”  Herbert and his mother exchanged glances. They hardly knew whether to feel more amused or disgusted at their visitor's meanness.  “Mr. Graham,” said Herbert, “if you wish to secure my services, you will have to pay me three dollars a week.”  The storekeeper held up both hands in dismay.  “Three dollars a week for a boy!” he exclaimed.  “Yes, sir; I will come for a short time for that sum, till you get used to the management of the post office, but I shall feel justified in leaving you when I can do better.”  “You must think I am made of money,” said Ebenezer hastily.  “I think you can afford to pay me that salary.”  For twenty minutes the new postmaster tried to beat down his prospective clerk, but Herbert was obstinate, and Ebenezer rather ruefully promised to give him his price, chiefly because it was absolutely necessary that he should engage some one who was more familiar with the post-office work than he was. Herbert agreed to go to work the next morning.     CHAPTER III. A PRODIGAL SON.    Herbert did not look forward with very joyful anticipations to the new engagement he had formed. He knew very well that he should not like Ebenezer Graham as an employer, but it was necessary that he should earn something, for the income was now but two dollars a week. He was sorry, too, to displace Tom Tripp, but upon this point his uneasiness was soon removed, for Tom dropped in just after Mr. Graham had left the house, and informed Herbert that he was to go to work the next day for a farmer in the neighborhood, at a dollar and a half per week, and board besides.  “I am glad to hear it, Tom,” said Herbert, heartily. “I didn't want to feel that I was depriving you of employment.”  “You are welcome to my place in the store,” said Tom. “I'm glad to give it up. Mr. Graham seemed to think I was made of iron, and I could work like a machine, without getting tired. I hope he pays you more than a dollar and a half a week.”  “He has agreed to pay me three dollars,” said Herbert.  Tom whistled in genuine amazement.  “What! has the old man lost his senses?” he exclaimed. “He must be crazy to offer such wages as that.”  “He didn't offer them. I told him I wouldn't come for less.”  “I don't see how he came to pay such a price.”  “Because he wanted me to take care of the post office. I know all about it, and he doesn't.”  “As soon as he learns, he will reduce your wages.”  “Then I shall leave him.”  “Well, I hope you'll like store work better than I do.”  The next two or three days were spent in removing the post office to one corner of Eben-ezer Graham's store. The removal was superintended by Herbert, who was not interfered with to any extent by his employer, nor required to do much work in the store. Our hero was agreeably surprised, and began to think he should get along better than he anticipated.  At the end of the first week the storekeeper, while they were closing the shutters, said: “I expect, Herbert, you'd just as lieves take your pay in groceries and goods from the store?”  “No, sir,” answered Herbert, “I prefer to be paid in money, and to pay for such goods as we buy.”  “I don't see what odds it makes to you,” said Ebenezer. “It comes to the same thing, doesn't it?”  “Then if it comes to the same thing,” retorted Herbert, “why do you want to pay me in goods?”  “Ahem! It saves trouble. I'll just charge everything you buy, and give you the balance Saturday night.”  “I should prefer the money, Mr. Graham,” said Herbert, firmly.  So the storekeeper, considerably against his will, drew three dollars in bills from the drawer and handed them to his young clerk.  “It's a good deal of money, Herbert,” he said, “for a boy. There ain't many men would pay you such a good salary.”  “I earn every cent of it, Mr. Graham,” said Herbert, whose views on the salary question differed essentially from those of his employer.  The next morning Mr. Graham received a letter which evidently disturbed him. Before referring to its contents, it is necessary to explain that he had one son, nineteen years of age, who had gone to Boston two years previous, to take a place in a dry-goods store on Washington Street. Ebenezer Graham, Jr., or Eben, as he was generally called, was, in some respects, like his father. He had the same features, and was quite as mean, so far as others were concerned, but willing to spend money for his own selfish pleasures. He was fond of playing pool, and cards, and had contracted a dangerous fondness for whisky, which consumed all the money he could spare from necessary expenses, and even more, so that, as will presently appear, he failed to meet his board bills regularly. Eben had served an apprenticeship in his father's store, having been, in fact, Tom"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],["title","Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#2)"],["body","pp's predecessor; he tired of his father's strict discipline, and the small pay out of which he was required to purchase his clothes, and went to Boston to seek a wider sphere.  To do Eben justice, it must be admitted that he had good business capacity, and if he had been able, like his father, to exercise self-denial, and make money-getting his chief enjoyment, he would no doubt have become a rich man in time. As it was, whenever he could make his companions pay for his pleasures, he did so.  I now come to the letter which had brought disquietude to the storekeeper.  It ran thus:  “DEAR SIR: I understand that you are the father of Mr. Eben Graham, who has been a boarder at my house for the last six months. I regret to trouble you, but he is now owing me six weeks board, and I cannot get a cent out of him, though he knows I am a poor widow, dependent on my board money for my rent and house expenses. As he is a minor, the law makes you responsible for his bills, and, though I dislike to trouble you, I am obliged, in justice to myself, to ask you to settle his board bill, which I inclose.  “You will do me a great favor if you will send me the amount--thirty dollars--within a week, as my rent is coming due.  “Yours respectfully, SUSAN JONES.”  The feelings of a man like Ebenezer Graham can be imagined when he read this unpleasant missive.  “Thirty dollars!” he groaned. “What can the graceless boy be thinking of, to fool away his money, and leave his bills to be settled by me. If this keeps on, I shall be ruined! It's too bad, when I am slaving here, for Eben to waste my substance on riotous living. I've a great mind to disown him. Let him go his own way, and fetch up in the poorhouse, if he chooses.”  But it is not easy for a man to cast off an only son, even though he is as poorly supplied with natural affections as Ebenezer Graham. Besides, Eben's mother interceded for him, and the father, in bitterness of spirit, was about to mail a registered letter to Mrs. Jones, when the cause of his anguish suddenly made his appearance in the store.  “How are you, father?” he said, nonchalantly, taking a cigar from his mouth. “Didn't expect to see me, did you?”  “What brings you here, Eben?” asked Mr. Graham, uneasily.  “Well, the cars brought me to Stockton, and I've walked the rest of the way.”  “I've heard of you,” said his father, frowning. “I got a letter last night from Mrs. Jones.”  “She said she was going to write,” said Eben, shrugging his shoulders.  “How came it,” said his father, his voice trembling with anger, “that you haven't paid your board bill for six weeks?”  “I didn't have the money,” said Eben, with a composure which was positively aggravating to his father.  “And why didn't you have the money? Your wages are ample to pay all your expenses.”  “It costs more money to live in Boston than you think for, father.”  “Don't you get ten dollars a week, sir? At your age I got only seven, and saved two dollars a week.”  “You didn't live in Boston, father.”  “I didn't smoke cigars,” said his father, angrily, as he fixed his eye on the one his son was smoking. “How much did you pay for that miserable weed?”  “You're mistaken, father. It's a very good article. I paid eight dollars a hundred.”  “Eight dollars a hundred!” gasped Mr. Graham. “No wonder you can't pay your board bill--I can't afford to spend my money on cigars.”  “Oh, yes, you can, father, if you choose. Why, you're a rich man.”  “A rich man!” repeated Mr. Graham, nervously. “It would take a rich man to pay your bills. But you haven't told me why you have come home.”  “I lost my situation, father--some meddlesome fellow told my employer that I occasionally played a game of pool, and my tailor came to the store and dunned me; so old Boggs gave me a long lecture and my walking papers, and here I am.”  Ebenezer Graham was sorely troubled, and, though he isn't a favorite of mine, I confess, that in this matter he has my sincere sympathy.     CHAPTER IV. HERBERT LOSES HIS PLACE.    Ebenezer Graham with some difficulty ascertained from Eben that he had other bills, amounting in the aggregate to forty-seven dollars. This added to the board bill, made a total of seventy-seven dollars. Mr. Graham's face elongated perceptibly.  “That is bad enough,” he said; “but you have lost your income also, and that makes matters worse. Isn't there a chance of the firm taking you back?”  “No, sir,” replied the prodigal. “You see, we had a flare up, and I expressed my opinion of them pretty plainly. They wouldn't take me back if I'd come for nothing.”  “And they won't give you a recommendation, either?” said Ebenezer, with a half groan.  “No, sir; I should say not.”  “So you have ruined your prospects so far as Boston is concerned,” said his father, bitterly. “May I ask how you expect to get along?”  “I have a plan,” said Eben, with cheerful confidence.  “What is it?”  “I would like to go to California. If I can't get any situation in San Francisco, I can go to the mines.”  “Very fine, upon my word!” said his father, sarcastically. “And how do you propose to get to California?”  “I can go either by steamer, across the isthmus, or over the Union Pacific road.”  “That isn't what I mean. Where are you to get the money to pay your fare with?”  “I suppose you will supply that,” said Eben.  “You do? Well, it strikes me you have some assurance,” ejaculated Mr. Graham. “You expect me to advance hundreds of dollars, made by working early and late, to support a spendthrift son!”  “I'll pay you back as soon as I am able,” said Eben, a little abashed.  “No doubt! You'd pay me in the same way you pay your board bills,” said Ebenezer, who may be excused for the sneer. “I can invest my money to better advantage than upon you.”  “Then, if you will not do that,” said Eben, sullenly, “I will leave you to suggest a plan.”  “There is only one plan I can think of, Eben. Go back to your old place in the store. I will dismiss the Carr boy, and you can attend to the post office, and do the store work.”  “What, go back to tending a country grocery, after being a salesman in a city store!” exclaimed Eben, disdainfully.  “Yes, it seems the only thing you have left. It's your own fault that you are not still a salesman in the city.”  Eben took the cigar from his mouth, and thought rapidly.  “Well,” he said, after a pause, “if I agree to do this, what will you pay me?”  “What will I pay you?”  “Yes, will you pay me ten dollars a week--the same as I got at Hanbury & Deane's?”  “Ten dollars a week!” ejaculated Ebenezer, “I don't get any more than that myself.”  “I guess there's a little mistake in your calculations, father,” said Eben, significantly. “If you don't make at least forty dollars a week, including the post office, then I am mistaken.”  “So you are--ridiculously mistaken!” said his father, sharply. “What you presume is entirely out of the question. You forget that you will be getting your board, and Tom Tripp only received a dollar and a half a week without board.”  “Is that all you pay to Herbert Carr?”  “I pay him a leetle more,” admitted Ebenezer.  “What will you give me?”  “I'll give you your board and clothes,” said Ebenezer, “and that seems to be more than you made in Boston.”  “Are you in earnest?” asked Eben, in genuine dismay.  “Certainly. It isn't a bad offer, either.”  “Do you suppose a young man like me can get along without money?”  “You ought to get along without money for the next two years, after the sums you've wasted in Boston. It will cripple me to pay your bills,” and the storekeeper groaned at the thought of the inroads the payment would make on his bank account.  “You're poorer than I thought, if seventy-five dollars will cripple you,” said Eben, who knew his father's circumstances too well to be moved by this representation.  “I shall be in the poorhouse before many years if I undertake to pay all your bills, Eben.”  After all, this was not, perhaps, an exaggeration, for a spendthrift son can get through a great deal of money.  “I can't get along without money, father,” said Eben, decidedly. “How can I buy cigars, let alone other things?”  “I don't want you to smoke cigars. You'll be a great deal better off without them,” said his father, sharply.  “I understand; it's necessary to my health,” said Eben, rather absurdly.  “You won't smoke at my expense,” said Ebenezer, decidedly. “I don't smoke myself, and I never knew any good come of it.”  “All the same, I must have some money. What will people say about a young man of my age not having a cent in his pocket? They think my father is very mean.”  “I'll allow you fifty cents a week,” said Mr. Graham, after a pause.  “That won't do! You seem to think I am only six or seven years old!”  Finally, after considerable haggling, Mr. Graham agreed to pay his son a dollar and a half a week, in cash, besides board and clothes. He reflected that he should be obliged to board and clothe his son at any rate, and should save a dollar and a half from Herbert's wages.  “Well,” he said, “when will you be ready to go to work?”  “I must have a few days to loaf, father. I have been hard at work for a long time, and need some rest.”  “Then you can begin next Monday morning. I'll get Herbert to show you how to prepare the mail, so that you won't have any trouble about the post-office work.”  “By the way, father, how do you happen to have the post office? I thought Mrs. Carr was to carry it on.”  “So she did, for a time, but a woman ain't fit for a public position of that kind. So I applied for the position, and got it.”  “What's Mrs. Carr going to do?”  “She's got her pension,” said Ebenezer, shortly.  “Eight dollars a month, isn't it?”  “Yes.”  “That ain't much to support a family.”  “She'll have to do something else, then, I suppose.”  “There isn't much to do in Wayneboro.”  “That isn't my lookout. She can take in sewing, or washing,” suggested Ebenezer, who did not trouble himself much about the care of his neighbors. “Besides there's Herbert-"]]]
