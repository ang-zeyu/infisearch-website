Now the reader understands how it happened that Squire Pope and Nick Holden made a call on Philip. As to what passed at the interview, we must refer him to the next chapter.     CHAPTER VI. FUSS ABOUT A FIDDLE.   “Ahem! Good evening!” said Squire Pope to Frank Dunbar, taking no notice of Philip’s cold but polite salutation.  “Good evening! Will you go into the house?” said Frank.  “I believe not. I have not time.”  “I am sorry father isn’t home. He just started for the village.”  “Ahem! it was not to see your father that I called,” answered Squire Pope. “I wish to have a few words with this young man,” indicating Philip stiffly.  “I am at your service, Squire Pope,” said Philip, with ceremonious politeness.  “We came about the fiddle,” interrupted Nick Holden, who always wanted to have a share in the conversation.  Squire Pope frowned, for he did not relish Nick’s interference.  “Nicholas,” he said severely, “I apprehend I am competent to manage the business we have come upon.”  “Don’t get riled, squire,” said Nick, by no means abashed by this rebuke. “I thought you were kinder slow about comin’ to the point.”  “Your interruption was very indecorous. I do not require any assistance or any suggestions.”  “All right, squire!”  Squire Pope now turned to our hero, and said:  “As I was about to say, when interrupted by Nicholas, I have come to require you to give up the Violin which, without authority and against my express command, you withheld from the auction.”  “The violin is mine, Squire Pope,” said Philip firmly, “and I mean to keep it!”  “You talk like an ignorant boy. As a minor, you had no claim to the possession of any article except your clothing. I judged it best that the violin should be sold at the auction, and it is presumptuous for you to set up your judgment against mine!”  “I don’t take that view of it,” said Philip, and then he stopped.  He knew it was of no use to argue against the squire, who was obstinate to the verge of pig-headedness, if I may be allowed to use the expression. He felt that it would be only wasting his breath.  “It is quite immaterial how you view the subject,” said the squire pompously. “My mind is made up, and my resolution is not likely to be shaken by a boy.”  “Then, sir,” answered Philip, in a respectful tone but with a slight smile, “it is hardly worth while for me to say any more.”  “I am glad you have arrived at so sensible a conclusion,” said Squire Pope. “I take it that you have the violin here.”  “Yes, sir.”  “Then bring it out and give it to me.”  Now came the critical point, when Philip must array himself in determined opposition to Squire Pope. He felt that he was entirely in the right; still he regretted the necessity of the antagonism.  Philip had one thing in his favor: He had plenty of self-control, and, although he was very indignant at the course of the squire, which he regarded as unjustifiable, he made up his mind to be as respectful as circumstances would permit.  “I don’t think you understand me, Squire Pope,” he said. “I refuse to give up the violin!”  “You refuse to give up the violin!” repeated Squire Pope, scarcely believing the testimony of his ears. “Do I hear you aright?”  “Yes, sir.”  “I never saw such impudence!” ejaculated Nick Holden, wishing to egg on the squire.  “Do you mean to defy me to my face?” demanded Squire Pope, growing very red.  “I don’t wish to defy you or anybody else,” returned Philip; “but I shall stand up for my rights.”  “Misguided boy!” said the squire severely; “you will yet rue this rash and heedless course. Frank,” he continued, turning to Frank Dunbar, “do you know where Philip’s violin is!”  “Yes, sir.”  “Do me the favor to bring it out and place it in my hands.”  “You must excuse me, Squire Pope,” answered Frank. “It belongs to Philip, and I have no right to meddle with it.”  “If Philip has told you this, he has misrepresented,” said the squire, rather discouraged by this second rebuff. “The violin does not belong to Philip. It belongs to this young man.”  And, with a wave of his hand, he designated Nick Holden.  It was not polite, but Frank Dunbar was so surprised by this announcement that he whistled.  As for Philip, he regarded Nick calmly; but there didn’t seem to be any sign of yielding in his look.  “It belongs to Nicholas, because I have sold it to him,” continued Squire Pope doggedly.  “That’s so!” corroborated Nick complacently. “The squire sold me the fiddle for two-fifty. It’s mine now, and you’d better fetch it along out, or there’ll be trouble.”  Philip turned to Squire Pope, and said quietly:  “As you had no right to sell it, the sale amounts to nothing. If you had a right, I should say you were not very shrewd to sell an instrument that cost twenty-five dollars—and was considered a bargain at the price—for two dollars and fifty cents.”  “The violin cost twenty-five dollars!” ejaculated the squire, in genuine surprise.  For, as it has already been stated, he had no idea whatever of the usual price for a violin.  “Yes, sir.”  “Don’t you believe him, squire,” said Nicholas, afraid that he would lose what he knew to be a good bargain. “No fiddle that was ever made cost twenty-five dollars. It’s ridiculous!”  “It does seem a large price,” said the squire guardedly.  Squire Pope would doubtless have been surprised to learn that certain violins of celebrated make—such as the Cremonas—have sold for thousands of dollars. Probably he would have disbelieved it.  Nevertheless, he began to think that he had been too precipitate in accepting Nick Holden’s offer.  If he should sacrifice, or sell at an utterly inadequate price, any article belonging to the boy whom he considered his ward, he knew that he would be blamed, and he began to consider how he could recede from the bargain.  “Nicholas,” he said, “I didn’t exactly sell the violin to you. I will ascertain what is a fair price for it, and then I will consider your proposal.”  “You sold it right out, squire,” said Nick, “and I can prove it. Didn’t you just say it was mine. There, now!”  Nick turned triumphantly to Frank and Phil, but, for very good reasons, they did not care to side with him.  “I say, you haven’t treated me right,” persisted Nick, who had no particular respect nor veneration for the squire, and was not to be deterred from speaking as he felt. “I offered you two-fifty, and you said I should have it, and you got me to call at your house to come here for it.”  “I cannot sacrifice the property of my ward,” said Squire Pope. “I must ascertain how much the violin is worth.”  “A bargain is a bargain, every time!” said Nick, irritated.  “I will let you have it as cheap as anybody,” said the squire, who thought it possible that Nick might be the only one who desired to purchase it. “That ought to satisfy you. Philip, go and bring me the violin, and I will carry it home and dispose of it to the best advantage.”  “You must excuse me, Squire Pope. I shall not let it leave my possession.” Just then Squire Pope espied Mr. Dunbar returning from the village, and hailed him as a probable ally. He laid the matter before him, and requested him to compel Philip to get the violin.  “You must excuse me, squire,” said Mr. Dunbar coldly. “Philip is my guest, and he shall be protected in his rights as long as he remains here.”  Without a word, Squire Pope walked off, in angry discomfiture, in one direction, while Nick, equally dissatisfied, walked off in another.  “They don’t seem happy!” said Frank slyly.  “I wish I knew where it was going to end,” returned Philip gravely.  “It seems to me,” said Frank, “the squire is making a great fuss about a fiddle, for a man of his dignity.”  “He doesn’t care about the violin. He wants to have his own way,” said Philip, thus hitting the nail on the head.     CHAPTER VII. MR. JOE TUCKER   Before going further, I will introduce to the reader, a citizen of Norton, who filled a position for which he was utterly unfitted. This man was Joe Tucker, in charge of the almshouse.  He had not been selected by the town authorities on the ground of fitness, but simply because he was willing to work cheap. He received a certain low weekly sum for each one of his inmates, and the free use of apartments for himself and family, with the right to cultivate the ten acres of land connected with the establishment, and known as the Town Farm.  His family consisted of three persons—himself, his wife, and a son, Ezekiel, familiarly known as Zeke, now sixteen years old. The leading family trait was meanness.  Mr. Tucker supplied a mean table even for a poorhouse, and some of the hapless inmates complained bitterly. One had even had the boldness to present a complaint to the selectmen, and that body, rather reluctantly, undertook to investigate the justness of the complaint. They deputed Squire Pope to visit the poorhouse and inquire into the matter.  Now, though Squire Pope thought himself unusually sharp, it was the easiest thing in the world for a cunning person like Joe Tucker to satisfy him that all was right.  “Mr. Tucker,” said Squire Pope pompously, “I am deputed by the selectmen, and I may add by the overseers of the poor, to investigate a complaint made by one of the paupers in relation to the fare you offer them.”  “Who is it!” inquired Mr. Tucker.  “It is Ann Carter. She says you don’t allow her sugar in her tea, and only allow one slice of bread at supper, and that the meat is so bad she can’t eat it.”  “Just like the old woman!” exclaimed Mr. Tucker indignantly. “Oh, she’s a high-strung pauper, she is! Expects all the delicacies of the season for seventy-five cents a week. She’d ought to go to the Fifth Avenoo Hotel in New York, and then I’ll bet a cent she wouldn’t be satisfied.”  It is observable that even in his imaginary bets "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5673"],["title","The Young Musician; Or, Fighting His Way (#5)"],["body","Mr. Tucker maintained his economical habits, and seldom bet more than a cent. Once, when very much excited, he had bet five cents, but this must be attributed to his excited state of mind.  “So you regard her complaints as unreasonable, do you, Mr. Tucker?” observed the investigating committee.  “Unreasonable? I should think they was. I allow, Squire Pope, we don’t live like a first-class hotel”—Mr. Tucker’s language was rather mixed—“but we live as well as we can afford to. As to sugar, we don’t allow the paupers to put it in for themselves, or they’d ruin us by their extravagance. Mrs. Tucker puts sugar in the teapot before she pours it out. I s’pose Ann Carter would put as much in one cup of tea as Mrs. T. uses for the whole teapotful, if she had her way.”  This was very probably true, as the frugal Mrs. Tucker only allowed one teaspoonful for the entire supply.  “That looks reasonable, Mr. Tucker,” said the squire approvingly. “Now about the bread and the meat?”  “The paupers has plenty of bread,” said Mr. Tucker. “Our bread bill is actually enormous.”  “And as to the meat?”  “We don’t give ’em roast turkey every day, and we don’t buy tenderloin steaks to pamper their appetites,” said Mr. Tucker, “though we’re perfectly willing to do it if the town’ll pay us so we can afford it. Do you think the town’ll agree to pay me twenty-five cents more a week for each one, squire?”  “Certainly not. It can’t be thought of,” said the squire hastily, knowing that if the selectmen advocated such a measure they would probably lose their reelection.  “If it would, we might live a little better, so that Ann Carter wouldn’t have to complain, though, bless your soul! that woman is always complainin’.”  “Ahem! Mr. Tucker, you present the matter to me in a new light. I really feel that Ann Carter is very unreasonable in her complaints.”  “I knowed you’d do me justice, squire,” said Mr. Tucker effusively. “You’re a sharp man. You ain’t a-goin’ to be taken in by any of them paupers’ rigmarole. I always said, Squire Pope, that you was the right man in the right place, and that the town was lucky to have so intelligent and public-spirited a citizen fillin’ her most important offices.”  “Mr. Tucker,” said the squire, “you gratify me. It has ever been my aim to discharge with conscientious fidelity the important trusts which the town has committed to my charge—”  “I’ll bear witness to that, squire.”  “And your sincere tribute gives me great satisfaction.”  “I hope you’ll report things right to the board, Squire Pope?” said Mr. Joe Tucker insinuatingly.  “Be assured I will, Mr. Tucker. I consider you a zealous and trustworthy official, striving hard to do your duty in the place the town has assigned you.”  “I do, indeed, squire,” said Mr. Tucker, pulling on a red handkerchief and mopping some imaginary tears. “Excuse my emotions, sir, but your generous confidence quite unmans me. I—I—trust now that I shall be able to bear meekly the sneers and complaints of Ann Carter and her fellow paupers.”  “I will stand by you, Mr. Tucker,” said Squire Pope cordially, for the man’s flattery, coarse as it was, had been like incense to his vanity. “I will stand by you, and uphold you by my testimony.”  “Thank you, squire. With such an impartial advocate I will continue to do my duty and fear nothing.”  As Squire Pope left the almshouse, Mr. Tucker winked at himself in the glass, and said quizzically:  “I guess I’m all right now. The vain old fool thinks he’s a second Solomon, and thinks I regard him as such. Oh, it takes me to get round him!”  Squire Pope wrote an elaborate report, in which he stated that, after searching investigation, he had ascertained that the complaints of Ann Carter were absolutely groundless, and gave it as his conviction that Mr. Tucker’s treatment of her and her associate paupers was characterized by remarkable consideration and humanity.  Such officials as he have much to answer for, and yet there are plenty just as false to their responsibilities as he.  It was two days after Squire Pope’s ineffectual attempt to possess himself of Philip’s violin, that our hero was walking along a country road, on his return from an errand which, he had undertaken for his friend’s father, when his attention was drawn to the yelping of a small dog, that seemed in fear or pain.  Looking over the stone wall, Philip saw Zeke Tucker amusing himself by thrusting the dog’s head into a pool of dirty water, and holding it there till the animal was nearly strangled. The dog’s suffering appeared to yield the most exquisite amusement to the boy, who burst into peal after peal of rude laughter as he watched the struggles of his victim.  Philip, like every decent boy, had a horror of cruelty, and the sight stirred him to immediate anger and disgust.  “What are you doing there, Zeke Tucker?” he demanded sternly.  “None of your business!” answered Zeke, frowning.  “You’d better answer my question,” said Philip, who had by this time jumped over the wall.  “Then I will. I’m havin’ a little fun. What have you got to say about it?” retorted Zeke.  And once more he plunged the head of the poor dog into the filthy pool.  The next moment he found himself floundering on his back, while the dog, slipping from his grasp, was running across the meadows. “What did you do that for!” demanded Zeke, springing up, his face flaming with rage.  “I rather think you understand well enough,” answered Philip contemptuously.  “What business have you to touch me? I can have you arrested, you low pauper!”  “What’s that? What did you call me?” demanded Philip.  “I called you a pauper.”  “By what right?”  “Squire Pope told my father he was going to bring you over to the poorhouse to live. You just see if my father doesn’t give it to you then!”  “Thank you,” said Phil contemptuously; “but I don’t propose to board at your establishment, not even to obtain the pleasure of your society.”  “Maybe you can’t help yourself,” said Zeke gleefully.  For he saw what had escaped the notice of Philip, whose back was turned—namely, a four-seated carryall, containing his father and Squire Pope, which had just halted in the road, hard by.  “Mr. Tucker,” said Squire Pope, in a low tone, “now will be the best opportunity to capture the boy and carry him to the almshouse.”  “All right—I’m ready,” said Tucker readily.  For another boarder would bring him sixty cents a week more.  They stopped the horses and prepared for business.     CHAPTER VIII. IN THE ENEMY’S HANDS   Philip heard a step, and turned to see whose it was; but, when he recognized Mr. Tucker, the latter’s hand was already on his collar.  “What have you been doin’ to Zeke? Tell me that, you young rascal,” said Mr. Tucker roughly.  “He pitched into me savage, father,” answered Zeke, who had picked himself up, and was now engaged in brushing the dust from his coat.  “Pitched into ye, did he?” repeated Joe Tucker grimly. “I reckon he didn’t know your father was ’round. What have you got to say for yourself, eh?”  Philip regarded his captor contemptuously, and didn’t struggle to escape, knowing that he was not a match for a man five inches taller than himself. But contempt he could not help showing, for he knew very well that Zeke had inherited his mean traits largely from his father.  “I’ll thank you to remove your hand from my collar, sir,” said Philip. “When you have done that, I will explain why I pitched into Zeke, as he calls it.”  “Don’t you let go, father!” said Zeke hastily. “He’ll run away, if you do.”  “If I do, you can catch me between you,” returned Philip coolly.  “I reckon that’s so,” said Mr. Tucker, withdrawing his hand, but keeping wary watch of our hero.  “Now go ahead!” said he.  Philip did so.  “I saw Zeke torturing a small dog,” he explained, “and I couldn’t stand by and let it go on.”  “What was he doin’ to him?” inquired Mr. Tucker.  “Putting the poor animal’s head into this dirty pool, and keeping it there till it was nearly suffocated.”  “Was you doin’ that, Zeke?” asked his father.  “I was havin’ a little fun with him,” said Zeke candidly.  “It might have been fun to you, but it wasn’t to him,” said Phil.  “Why didn’t you ask Zeke to stop, and not fly at him like a tiger?” demanded Mr. Tucker.  “I did remonstrate with him, but he only laughed, and did it again.”  “He hadn’t no right to order me,” said Zeke. “It wa’n’t no business of his if I was havin’ a little fun with the dog.”  “And I had a little fun with, you,” returned Philip—“You couldn’t have complained if I had dipped your head in the water also.”  “I ain’t a dog!” said Zeke.  “I should respect you more if you were,” said Philip.  “Are you goin’ to let him talk to me like that!” asked Zeke, appealing to his father.  “No, I ain’t,” said Mr. Tucker angrily. “You’ve committed an assault and battery on my son, you rascal, and you’ll find there ain’t no fun in it for you. I could have you arrested and put in jail, couldn’t I, squire?”  “Ahem! Well, you could have him fined; but, as he is to be under your care, Mr. Tucker, you will have a chance of making him conduct himself properly.”  “What do you mean by that, Squire Pope?” asked Philip quickly.  “Young man, I do not choose to be catechized,” said Squire Pope, in a dignified manner; “but I have no objections to tell you that I have made arrangements with Mr. Tucker to take you into the poorhouse.”  “I’ve heard that before, but I couldn’t believe it,” said Philip proudly.  “I guess you’ll have to believe it pretty soon, he, he!” laughed Zeke, with a grin which indicated his high delight. “I guess dad’ll make you stand round when he gits you into the poor-house.”  “Don’t you consider me capable of earning my own living, Squire Pope?” asked Philip.  “Ahem! Yes, you will be one of these days. You won’t have to stay in the almshouse all your life.”  “You’ll have a chance to earn your livin’ with me.” said Mr. Tucker. “I shall give you something to do, you may depend.”  “You can make him saw and split wood,"]]]
