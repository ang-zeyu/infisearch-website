It did not occur to him, however, that he was responsible for Sam's presence in the city. He was glad to see a familiar Hampton face, and he said cordially: \"How are you, Sam?\"  Sam nodded.  \"You don't mean to say that you are stopping here, do you?\"  \"Yes, I do,\" said Ben, smiling. \"Why not?\"  \"Because it's a first-class hotel.\"  \"Why shouldn't I stay at a first-class hotel, Sam?\"  \"Because you are a poor boy. Maybe you've got some relations among the servants?\"  \"If I have I don't know it.\"  \"Your uncle told me you were stopping here, but I didn't believe it.\"  \"Do you believe it now?\" asked Ben.  \"Perhaps you just stay round here to make people believe you are a guest of the house.\"  \"Why should I care what people think? Nobody knows me here. However, Sam, if you want to be convinced, just come up to my room with me.\"  Sam concluded to accept the invitation, and accompanied Ben to the desk.  \"Please give me the key to number sixty-six,\" said Ben.  \"Here it is, sir.\"  Sam began to think Ben's statement was true, after all. There was no room for doubt when Ben ushered him into the handsome chamber which he occupied.  \"Make yourself at home, Sam,\" said Ben, enjoying his companion's surprise.  \"It's very queer,\" thought Sam. \"I wonder whether he won't run off without paying his bill.\"  Sam rather hoped that this might be the case, as it would involve Ben in disgrace.  \"Your uncle tells me you are going to sail for California on Saturday.\"  \"Yes, Sam.\"  \"Have you bought your ticket?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How much did you pay?\"  \"Excuse me. I would rather not tell just now.\"  \"I suppose he goes in the steerage,\" thought Sam.  As he could learn nothing more from our hero, Sam soon left him.  It was certainly remarkable that the boy to whom he had recently offered the position of his bootblack should be a guest of a fashionable New York hotel.     CHAPTER XI.  MISS SINCLAIR'S STRATAGEM.   Mr. Campbell had no particular reason to think that Miss Ida Sinclair, registering from Philadelphia, was the ward of whom he was in pursuit. Still, he thought it worth while to find out what he could about her, and managed to waylay Ben in the corridor of the hotel the next morning.  \"Good morning, boy!\" he said stiffly, not having the art of ingratiating himself with young people.  \"Good morning, man!\" Ben thought of replying, but he thought this would be hardly polite, and said: \"Good morning, sir,\" instead.  He suspected Mr. Campbell's purpose, and resolved to answer cautiously.  \"This is a nice hotel,\" said the guardian, resolving to come to the point by degrees.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I suppose you are too young to have traveled much?\"  \"I never traveled much, sir.\"  \"Didn't I see you in the company of a young lady?\"  \"Very likely, sir.\"  \"Your sister, I suppose?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"A relation, I suppose?\"  \"I call her Cousin Ida,\" said Ben truthfully.  \"Indeed! And she is from Philadelphia?\"  Ben was placed in a dilemma. He saw that he should be forced to misrepresent, and this he did not like. On the other hand, he could not tell the truth, and so betray Miss Sinclair to her persecutor.  \"You can tell by looking at the hotel register,\" he said coldly.  Mr. Campbell judged by Ben's tone that our hero meant to rebuke his curiosity, and, having really very little idea that he was on the right track, he thought it best to apologize.  \"Excuse my questions,\" he said, \"but I have an idea that I know your cousin.\"  \"In that case,\" said Ben, \"if you will tell me your name I will speak to Cousin Ida about it.\"  Now Mr. Campbell was in a dilemma. If Ida Sinclair were really the ward of whom he was in pursuit, his name would only put her on her guard. He quickly thought of a ruse.  \"I will send a card,\" he said.  He stepped to the clerk's desk, and asked for a blank card. After an instant's hesitation, he penciled the name James Vernon, and handed it to Ben.  \"The young lady may not remember my name,\" he said; \"but in an interview I think I can recall it to her recollection. Please give it to your cousin.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  Ben went up-stairs and tapped for admission at Miss Sinclair's door.  \"Well, Ben?\" she said inquiringly.  \"Here is a card which a gentleman down-stairs asked me to hand you.\"  \"James Vernon!\" repeated the young lady, in surprise. \"Why, I don't know any gentleman of that name.\"  \"He said you might not remember it; but he thought he could recall it to your recollection in a personal interview.\"  \"I don't want a personal interview with any gentleman.\"  \"Not with your guardian?\" asked Ben, smiling.  \"Was the man who handed you this card my guardian?\"  \"Yes; he tried to find out all he could from me; but wasn't very successful. Then he said he thought he knew you, and handed me this card.\"  \"So he thinks to delude me by masquerading under a false name! He must suspect that I am his ward.\"  \"Of course you won't see him?\"  \"No.\"  \"What shall I say?\"  \"That I don't remember the name, and decline to see him.\"  \"Won't that increase his suspicions?\"  \"I can't help it.\"  \"Very well.\"  Ben went below; but thought he might as well put off the interview. It was not till afternoon that Mr. Campbell met him again.  \"Did you deliver my card, boy?\" he asked.  \"My name is Benjamin,\" returned our hero, who did not fancy the manner of address.  \"Very well. Did you deliver my card, Benjamin?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What did your cousin say?\"  \"That she knew no gentleman or family of your name.\"  \"I did not expect she would remember; but I have reasons for asking an interview.\"  \"You mustn't be offended, sir; but she declines to meet a stranger.\"  Mr. Campbell was baffled.  \"She mistakes my motive,\" he said, in a tone expressive of annoyance. \"How long do you stay here?\"  \"I can't say, sir,\" said Ben coldly.  Mr. Campbell bit his lip and walked away. He did not fancy being foiled by a boy. It occurred to him, however, that by waiting patiently he might see the young lady at dinner. He kept watch, therefore, till he saw Ben entering the dining-room, and then, entering himself, secured a seat near-by. But the young lady, greatly to his chagrin, did not appear. Ben observed his vigilant watch, and after dinner reported to Miss Sinclair.  The young lady smiled.  \"I have thought of a way to deceive him and quiet his suspicions,\" she said.  Ben looked curious.  \"If I remain away from the table he will feel sure that I am his ward.\"  \"Yes, I suppose so.\"  \"Listen to my plan, then. I have the New York Herald here, with half a column of advertisements of seamtresses. I will give you a list of three, and you shall engage one to be here early to-morrow morning. Select one with a figure as much like mine as possible.\"  \"All right!\"  \"I see you look puzzled,\" said Miss Sinclair, smiling.  \"I am, a little; I don't know what good that will do.\"  \"Then I will explain. I shall dress the seamstress in one of my own dresses, and let her go to the table with you. Mr. Campbell will naturally suppose that she is Miss Ida Sinclair, and will be satisfied.\"  \"I see! That is splendid!\" exclaimed Ben, entering with hearty enthusiasm into the conspiracy.  It happened, luckily, that the first seamstress on whom he called was sufficiently like Miss Sinclair in figure to justify him in engaging her. He directed her to call at the hotel at eight the next morning without fail. The poor girl was glad to make this engagement, having been without employment for two weeks previous.  When she arrived, Miss Sinclair, without confiding too much in her, made known her desire, and the girl, who had had but a scanty breakfast, was glad to embrace the opportunity of enjoying the hospitality of a first-class hotel. Miss Sinclair had really work enough to employ her during the day.  When Mr. Campbell caught sight of Ben approaching the dining-room in company with a young lady, he advanced eagerly and peered into the young lady's face. He turned away in disappointment.  \"I have made a fool of myself. It is only a common country girl. I must look elsewhere for my ward.\"  Directly after breakfast Ben had the satisfaction of seeing the obnoxious guardian depart in a hack.  \"Good-by, Mr. Vernon!\" he said politely. \"I see you are leaving the hotel.\"  \"Good-by!\" muttered Campbell.  \"I hope you'll excuse my cousin for not seeing you?\"  \"I don't think she's the one I supposed,\" said Campbell. \"It's of no consequence.\"  Ben hastened to inform Miss Sinclair of her guardian's departure.  \"Now the field is clear,\" said Ida, breathing a sigh of relief.  \"I say, Ida, you managed him tip-top,\" said Ben admiringly. \"I never should have thought of such a plan.\"  Miss Sinclair smiled faintly.  \"I don't like to employ deceit,\" she said, \"but it seems necessary to fight such an enemy with his own weapons.\"  \"He wanted to deceive you. He put a wrong name on his card.\"  \"That is true, Ben. I must thank you for the manner in which you have aided me in this matter. I should not have known how to act if I had not had you to call upon.\"  Ben's face brightened.  \"I am glad to hear you say that, Cousin Ida,\" he said. \"You are spending so much money for me that I shall be glad to feel that I have earned some of it.\"  \"Have no trouble on that score, Ben. I foresee that you will continue to be of great service to me. I regard the money expended for you as well invested.\"  Ben heard this with satisfaction. It naturally gave him a feeling of heightened importance when he reflected that a wealthy heiress had selected him as her escort and right-hand man, and that she was satisfied with her choice.  On Saturday morning Miss Sinclair and Ben went on board "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5623"],["title","The Young Explorer; Or, Claiming His Fortune (#8)"],["body","California steamer, and when the tide served, they started on their long voyage.     CHAPTER XII.  IN SAN FRANCISCO.   Ben was not seasick, and enjoyed the novel experiences vastly. Miss Sinclair was less fortunate. For four days she was sick and confined to her stateroom. After that she was able to appear among the other passengers. Ben was very attentive, and confirmed the favorable opinion she had already formed of him.  At last the voyage came to a close. It was a bright, cheery morning when the steamer came within sight of San Francisco. It was not a populous and brilliant city as at present, for Ben's expedition dates back to the year 1856, only a few years after the discovery of gold. Still, there was a good-sized town on the site of the future city. The numerous passengers regarded it with rejoicing hearts, and exchanged hopeful congratulations. Probably with the exception of Miss Sinclair, all had gone out to make or increase their fortunes. Her fortune was already made. She had gone to enjoy personal liberty, and to find her plighted husband.  \"Well, Ben, we have nearly reached our destination,\" said Miss Sinclair, as she looked earnestly in the direction of the embryo city. \"You are glad, are you not?\"  \"Yes, Cousin Ida,\" said Ben slowly.  \"But you look thoughtful. Is there anything on your mind?\"  \"I feel sorry that I am to part from you, Cousin Ida.\"  \"Thank you, Ben, but we are not to part permanently. You don't mean to forsake me utterly?\"  \"Not if you need me,\" said our hero.  \"I shall still require your services. You remember that I came out here in search of a--friend?\" said Miss Sinclair, hesitating.  \"Yes, I know, Cousin Ida.\"  \"I am desirous that he should know that I am in San Francisco, but, unfortunately, though I know he is in California, I have no idea where, or in what part of it he is to be found. Once in communication with him, I need have no further apprehension of interference or persecution on the part of my guardian.\"  \"To be sure,\" said Ben straightforwardly. \"I suppose you would marry him?\"  \"That may come some time,\" said Miss Sinclair, smiling, \"but he must be found first.\"  \"You will travel about, I suppose?\" said Ben.  \"No; I shall engage some one to travel for me. It would not be suitable for a young lady to go from one mining-camp to another.\"  \"Have you thought of any one you can send?\" asked our hero.  \"Yes,\" said Miss Sinclair. \"He is rather young, but I shall try the experiment.\"  \"Do you mean me?\" asked Ben quickly.  \"Yes; are you willing to be my agent in the matter?\"  \"I should like it of all things,\" said Ben, with sparkling eyes.  \"Then you may consider yourself engaged. The details we will discuss presently.\"  \"And where will you stay, Cousin Ida?\"  \"In San Francisco. I have become acquainted with a lady on board who proposes to open a boarding-house in the city, or, rather, to take charge of one already kept by her sister. In my circumstances, it will be better for me to board with her than at a hotel. There I shall have a secure and comfortable home, while you are exploring the mining-districts in my interest.\"  \"That is an excellent plan,\" said Ben.  \"So I think.\"  Here the conversation was interrupted by the bustle of approaching departure. Ben landed in the company of Miss Sinclair and Mrs. Armstrong, and the three proceeded at once to the boarding-house, over which the latter was in future to preside. A comfortable room was assigned to Miss Sinclair, and a small one to Ben. They were plainly furnished, but both enjoyed being on land once more.  Our young hero, finding that his services were not required for the present, began to explore the city. It was composed almost wholly of wooden houses; some but one story in height, even on the leading streets, with here and there sand-hills, where now stand stately piles and magnificent hotels. He ascended Telegraph Hill, which then, as now, commanded a good view of the town and harbor; yet how different a view from that presented now. Ben was partly pleased and partly disappointed. Just from New York, he could not help comparing this straggling village on the shores of the Pacific with the even then great city on the Atlantic coast. He had heard so much of San Francisco that he expected something more. To-day a man may journey across the continent and find the same comfort, luxury, and magnificence in San Francisco which he left behind him in New York.  In his explorations Ben came to a showy building which seemed a center of attraction. It seemed well filled, and people were constantly coming in and going out. Ben's curiosity was excited.  \"What is that?\" he asked of a man who lounged outside, with a Mexican sombrero on his head and his hands thrust deep in his pockets.  \"That's the Bella Union, my chicken.\"  \"I don't know any better now.\"  \"Just go in there with a pocketful of gold-dust, like I did, and you'll find out, I reckon.\"  \"Is it a gambling-house?\" inquired Ben, rather excited, for he had heard much of such places, but never seen one.  \"It's the devil's den,\" said the man bitterly. \"I wish I'd never seen it.\"  \"Have you been unlucky?\"  \"Look here, boy, jest look at me,\" said the stranger. \"An hour ago I was worth a thousand dollars in gold-dust-took six months' hard work to scrape it together at the mines-now I haven't an ounce left.\"  \"Did you lose it there?\" asked Ben, somewhat startled.  \"Well, I staked it, and it's gone.\"  \"Have you nothing left?\"  \"Not an ounce. I haven't enough to pay for a bed.\"  \"What will you do for a place to sleep?\" inquired Ben, to whom this seemed an alarming state of things.  The stranger shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't worry about that,\" he said. \"I'll stretch myself out somewhere when night comes. I'm used to roughing it.\"  \"Won't you get cold sleeping out of doors?\" asked Ben.  The other gave a short, quick laugh.  \"What do you take me for, boy? I don't look delicate, do I?\"  \"Not very,\" answered Ben, smiling.  \"I've slept out under the stars pretty reg'lar for the past six months. I only wish I was back to the mines.\"  \"Do you think I can go in?\" Ben said hesitatingly.  \"Yes, youngster, there's nothin' to bender, but take a fool's advice, and ef you've got money in your pocket, don't do it.\"  \"You don't think I'd gamble, do you?\" said Ben, horror-struck.  \"I've seen youngsters smaller than you bet their pile.\"  \"You won't catch me doing it. I am a poor boy, and have nothing to lose.\"  \"All right, then. You're a country boy, ain't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"So was I once, but I've had the greenness rubbed off'n me. I was jest such a youngster as you once. I wish I could go back twenty years.\"  \"You're not very old yet,\" said Ben, in a tone of sympathy. \"Why don't you reform?\"  \"No, I'm not old-only thirty-six-and I ain't so bad as I might be. I'm a rough customer, I expect, but I wouldn't do anything downright mean. Ef you're goin' into this den, I'll go with you. I can't take care of myself, but mayhap I can keep you out of danger.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  So Ben and his new acquaintance entered the famous gambling-den. It was handsomely furnished and decorated, with a long and gaily appointed bar, while the mirrors, pictures, glass, and silverware excited surprise, and would rather have been expected in an older city. There were crowds at the counter, and crowds around the tables, and the air was heavy with the odor of Chinese punk, which was used for cigar-lights, The tinkle of silver coin was heard at the tables, though ounces of gold-dust were quite as commonly used in the games of chance.  \"I suppose a good deal of money is won here?\" said Ben, looking around curiously.  \"There's a good deal lost,\" said Ben's new acquaintance.  \"Gentlemen, will you drink with me?\" said a young man, with flushed face, rising from a table near-by, both hands full of silver and gold, \"I've been lucky to-night, and it's my treat.\"  \"I don't care if I do,\" said Ben's companion, with alacrity, and he named his drink.  \"What'll the boy have?\"  \"Nothing, thank you,\" answered Ben, startled,  \"That won't do. I insist upon your drinking,\" hiccuped the young man, who had evidently drunk freely already. \"Take it as a personal insult, if you don't.\"  \"Never mind the boy,\" said his new friend, to Ben's great relief. \"He's young and innocent. He hasn't been round like you an' me.\"  \"That's so,\" assented the young man, taking the remark as a compliment. \"Well, here's to you!\"  \"I wouldn't have done it,\" said Ben's new friend rejoining him; \"but it'll help me to forget what a blamed fool I've been to-night. You jest let the drink alone. That's my advice.\"  \"I mean to,\" said Ben firmly. \"Do people drink much out here?\"  \"Whisky's their nat'ral element,\" said the miner. \"Some of 'em don't drink water once a month. An old friend of mine, Joe Granger, act'lly forgot how it tasted. I gave him a glass once by way of a joke, and he said it was the weakest gin he ever tasted.\"  \"Are there no temperance societies out here?\" asked Ben.  The miner laughed.  \"It's my belief that a temperance lecturer would be mobbed, or hung to the nearest lamppost,\" he answered.  It is hardly necessary to say that even in 1856 intemperance was hardly as common in California as the statements of his new friend led Ben to suppose. His informant was sincere, and spoke according to his own observation. It is not remarkable that at the mines, in the absence of the comforts of civilization, those who drink rarely or not at all at home should seek the warmth and excitement of drink.  \"What's your name, boy?\" asked the miner abruptly.  \"Ben Stanton.\"  \"Where were you raised?\"  Though the term was a new one to Ben, he could not fail to understand it.  \"In the State of Connecticut.\"  \"That's where they make wooden nutmegs,\" said the miner, \"isn't it?\"  \"I never saw any made there,\" answered Ben, smiling.  \"I reckon you've come out here to make your fortin?\"  \"I should like to,\" answered Ben; \"but I shall be satisfied if I make a living, and "]]]
