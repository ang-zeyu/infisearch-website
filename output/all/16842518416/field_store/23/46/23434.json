His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.  He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.  (Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!  It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope across the bed.  Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.  But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.  The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.  Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug. The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.  Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.  As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,--except one eye.  At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the window sill to the tree outside.  \"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,\" said Mr. Tod.  Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.  He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--  \"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,\" said Mr. Tod.  The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also--grinning immensely.  He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.  When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.  Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.  But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.  In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened SOMETHING--much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.  There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop drip of water trickling from the mattress.  Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.  Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.  Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!  \"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,\" said Mr. Tod.  \"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot-water bottle.\"  \"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.\"  He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen--\"First I will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the blanket ...\"  He opened the door....  Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.  Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.  They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.  Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.  Everything was upset except the kitchen table.  And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.  The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.  The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry Jam.  And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.  When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.  Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.  As soon as the coast was clear Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes--  \"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them while I watch at the door.\"  But Benjamin was frightened--  \"Oh; oh! they are coming back!\"  \"No they are not.\"  \"Yes they are!\"  \"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry.\"  Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--  \"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them.\"  Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!  At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.  After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The day passed heavily.  Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.  In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.  \"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?\"  Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.  Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.  Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.  A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.  Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.  THE END     THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE  for THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE OF NEWLANDS   ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! \"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?\"  THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--  \"Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?\"  But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"  AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.  Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.  LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],["title","A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#6)"],["body","a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!  PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a VERY small person.  Lucie ran on, and on.  THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      \"Lily-white and clean, oh!     With little frills between, oh!     Smooth and hot--red rusty spot     Never here be seen, oh!\"  LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out \"Who's that?\"  Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.  THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.  Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!  \"WHO are you?\" said Lucie. \"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?\"  The little person made a bob-curtsey--\"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!\" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.  \"WHAT'S that thing?\" said Lucie--\"that's not my pocket-handkin?\"  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!\"  And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.  THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse--\"That isn't my pinny?\" said Lucie.  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.  \"THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's my pinny!\"  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  \"Oh that IS lovely!\" said Lucie.  \"AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"  \"Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  \"WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?\"  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.\"  \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.  \"WHAT are those funny little white things?\"  \"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.\"  \"There's my last pocket-handkin!\" said Lucie.  \"AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\"  \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"  \"WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?\" said Lucie.  \"Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"  \"Will their jackets take off?\" asked Lucy.  \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're ALWAYS marked at washing!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!  THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.  WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.  THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!  AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.  LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say \"Good-night,\" and to thank the washer-woman--But what a VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?  AND how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with PRICKLES!  Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.      * * * *  (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?  And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)   THE TALE OF GINGER & PICKLES  ONCE upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was \"Ginger and Pickles.\"  It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.  The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.  They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.  In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything --except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops.  Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.  The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.  The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.  Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.  \"I cannot bear,\" said he, \"to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels.\"  \"I have the same feeling about rats,\" replied Pickles, \"but it would never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's.\"  \"On the contrary, they would go nowhere,\" replied Ginger gloomily.  (Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not give credit.)  Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.  Now the meaning of \"credit\" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says she will pay another time.  And Pickles makes a low bow and says, \"With pleasure, madam,\" and it is written down in a book.  The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.  But there is no money in what is called the \"till.\"  The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.  But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.  As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.  Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.  They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.  When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog licence.  \"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,\" said Pickles.  \"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\"  \"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;\" said Pickles. \"The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\"  \"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.\"  \"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,\" replied Ginger.  \"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream crackers?\" \"You have eaten them yourself,\" replied Ginger.  Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.  They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.  \"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\"  \"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?\"  \"Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with compts'\" replied Ginger.  After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been"]]]
