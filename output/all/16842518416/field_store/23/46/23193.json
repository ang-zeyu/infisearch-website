On Friday afternoon he engaged in a pleasant discussion with Mrs. Marshall on some scriptural topic. Missionaries all understand the power of song, Mr. Durant was no exception, so at one point he sang one of his hymns:    \"How the light from Zion's mountain     Clears the mists of error's age:   Clarified in ray and fountain,     How its truths our fears assuage!    \"Tempest-tossed, we still are certain     Life is but a pleasant span.   Hope has painted every curtain     Pictured in the gospel plan.    \"Once again to every nation,     Jesus opens wide the door;   Here are truths that bring salvation,     Preached and practiced as of yore.    \"Joyful tidings to the people     From the perfect courts on high;   Sweetest chimes from tower and steeple     Ring: Redemption's drawing nigh.    \"Shine, thou light, with doubled splendor,     Spread thy soothing, restful rings,   Till the sun of Zion, tender     Rise, with healing in his wings!\"  The daughter was an interested listener, and at the close broke in with--\"It seems to me that there is no such thing as perfect happiness after all. We are always being disappointed in relation to some hope or desire, and when we engage in that which affords pastime or amusement, there is invariably a penalty following. Is not this true, Mr. Durant?\"  \"I could scarcely dispute with a lady, even if there were grounds for it,\" said he, gallantly.  \"But I prefer you would,\" she said, \"because you appear to know all about these things and I desire to learn. Why is it, for instance, that after enjoying myself greatly at a dance or other late entertainment, injured nature afterward cries out for revenge, and takes it? So with all things it seems to me. The pleasure experienced in meeting a dear friend is beclouded by the knowledge that there must be a parting soon; and death is ever near as if to remind us of the fact that life, happiness, honor, wealth, youth, are all fleeting and unsubstantial.\"  \"Very true.\"  \"Why Claire,\" said her mother, \"you are becoming a regular pessimist. Surely at your age there is no need to borrow trouble about death or anything else.\"  \"I do not borrow it, mamma, it comes. Pain follows pleasure, sorrow treads upon the heals of happiness, and misfortune is the constant attendant of fortune. There is, as I said, no perfect happiness, so it seems to me.\"  \"Pardon me,\" said the missionary, \"but you did not finish your sentence. Shall I do so for you?\"  \"O, by all means,\" replied the girl with eager delight.  \"Well, then,\" he continued, \"doubtless what you meant to say was that there is no such thing as perfect happiness in either the contemplation or realization of things which in themselves are fleeting and unsubstantial--that is, the things of the world. Every movement of the machinery of a steamer, for instance, creates friction, which in turn indicates an eventual breaking down, and so it is with all temporal things; thus we cannot rely upon them for permanent good, and in addition they are constantly subjecting us to peril.  \"It is impossible to create perfect results out of imperfect conditions; therefore, there can be no complete or unbroken happiness come out of earthly surroundings, for the reason that all such things are changeable and fleeting. And yet there is such a state as perfect joy unclouded and endless.\"  \"But not in this life, as you yourself have shown.\"  \"Yes, in this life.\"  \"I thought you referred to this life as uncertain and ephemeral and as such curtailed or extinguished its own joys.\"  \"That is true, also. But yet endless and supreme delight is to be found in it.\"  \"Where and how, pray?\"  \"In observing principles and practicing truths which lead to immortality, and which confer upon us the title-deeds to homes where pains and penalties are unknown, where all is peace, contentment and love.\"  \"Oh, yes, I did not think of that.\"  \"In such enjoyment there is no alloy. More than that; the more it is engaged in, the more enjoyable it becomes; it does not cloy, we cannot become surfeited; the more we devote our attention and effort to it the greater the desire we have to continue and to increase our experience. This is that perfect happiness with which nothing else can compare.\"  \"But would you have us dispense with all pleasures--with the refined indulgences, the innocent pastimes and the intellectual recreations which lighten our burdens at least for the time being, and have us participate in sacred things only? Should there be no buoyancy of spirit, no diversion, no relaxation, in order that there might be no penalty as the result of indulgence?\"  \"Why, what an--pardon me--absurd idea! Of course you do not advance it seriously and should therefore be free from criticism. Rather than that such a rule of conduct as you have suggested is the proper one, it is almost as bad as that in which amusement alone prevails. The medium course, which enables us to enjoy all that is properly enjoyable in its appropriate season, and still does not cause us to loose sight of the great aim and end of existence, is the right one. We should let our pastimes be the incidents in our career, not the objects of it; thus they lighten our burdens, and, for the time being, dispel some of the shadows that cross our pathway, whereas, if made the purpose of living--the only things to be considered--they become burdensome and even sinful.\"  \"Then the devout Christian may be happy and jovial without being less a Christian, on account of that?\"  \"Yes, indeed. More--it is pleasing to our Father for His children to be light-hearted, so long as their pleasures are proper and are enjoyed in moderation. The people from among whom I come enjoy themselves as much as other people do, but do not overlook their devotions, and above all they remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\"  \"That seems to me,\" said Mrs. Marshall, \"to be a sensible form of Christianity. Why, a person, according to your faith, can be profoundly religious and yet deny himself no proper amusement.\"  \"Most decidedly; that is our belief and practice.\"  \"It seems to me I would like to be a member of your Church,\" said the girl, artlessly, at which interesting stage of the conversation, Rev. Fitzallan entered, who greeted the party stiffly, his brow having a distinct frown as he looked at the westerner.  \"Pardon me,\" said the Clergyman, after a few commonplaces had passed, \"but we 'gather wisdom by the wayside,' and I have just acquired some information from that source concerning our friend here from the wilds, and as it surprised me, I thought it might equally surprise the rest of you, himself included, perhaps.\"  Evidently the churchman had been engaged in the questionable calling of picking up stray scraps of gossip here and there, containing as usual some truth mixed with much error. There was obviously trouble ahead.  \"Anything concerning me is not apt to be of sufficient consequence to be very interesting,\" said Mr. Durant, \"and having already stated all I thought worth saying about myself and my errand, there can be little or nothing that is surprising, I am sure.\"  \"Is it not a fact that you are from Salt Lake City?\"  \"It is.\"  \"It is! Why you never informed us of this and yet you have been associated with us several days.\"  \"Indeed! May I ask you, Mrs. Marshall, and you, Miss Marshall, what part of the country our friend here comes from?\"  The ladies did not know.  \"Indeed! Why sir, you have been associated with this family several weeks, and yet they do not know what particular point you came from. Perhaps like myself, you were never asked.\"  \"This is evasion,\" said the now thoroughly excited churchman. \"There is no place in my district possessed of such peculiar conditions as would place one of its inhabitants under suspicion because of them.\"  \"Nor in mine either, that I know of,\" calmly rejoined Durant.  \"Is not Salt Lake City the headquarters and residence of a class of people known as Mormons who hold exclusive sway there?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"That is what I have heard.\"  \"Surely, I am not accountable for what you have heard. There are a great many Mormons in Salt Lake, and just as many that are not Mormons; it is the headquarters of the Church as you suggest, but its members are not in exclusive sway there.\"  \"How can that be?\"  \"No matter about the means; the fact itself is what concerns us.\"  The churchman was discomfited and measurably confused; he was compelled to change his course.  \"You told us,\" said he, \"that you were an advocate of the Church of Jesus Christ; should there not be a suffix in these words--Latter-day Saints?\"  \"That is correct.\"  \"And is not 'Mormonism' its other name?\"  \"No, it has no other name. It is called 'Mormonism' by nearly every one not connected with it, and yet that is not a proper designation.\"  \"Then to yourself you are a 'Latter-day Saint,' and to the world you are a 'Mormon?'\"  \"That is it exactly.\"  \"Strange that we should be kept in ignorance of it so long.\"  \"I have answered every question fairly and in addition have stated everything necessary to a full explanation of my cause and myself. If the doctrine I teach be true--and it has stood all tests so far--can you find nothing more than a name to oppose it?\"  \"I hope sir, you do not accuse me of innuendo?\"  \"I accuse you of nothing.\"  \"Come now,\" said Mrs. Marshall, \"do not be too earnest.\"  \"Well, madam,\" said Rev. Fitzallan, \"I thought my services in this connection would be received graciously and thankfully. As they are not I occupy the position of an intruder and will take my leave.\"  \"Not on my account, I hope,\" said Mr. Durant. \"If there is an intruder here it is I, and it would be my duty to depart.\"  \"You must not go under such circumstances,\" said Mrs. Marshall.  The girl's looks seconded her mother's words, and the irate churchman permitted his passion to overcome his judgment.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but I will take my leave."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],["title","Considerations on Representative Government (#0)"],["body","ON REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT  By John Stuart Mill   Author Of \"A System Of Logic, Ratiocinative And Inductive\"    [Redactor's note: Italics are indicated by underscores surrounding the _italicized text_.]  [Footnotes initially found throughout the text have been numbered and placed at the end of the text.]     Preface   Those who have done me the honor of reading my previous writings will probably receive no strong impression of novelty from the present volume; for the principles are those to which I have been working up during the greater part of my life, and most of the practical suggestions have been anticipated by others or by myself. There is novelty, however, in the fact of bringing them together, and exhibiting them in their connection, and also, I believe, in much that is brought forward in their support. Several of the opinions at all events, if not new, are for the present as little likely to meet with general acceptance as if they were.  It seems to me, however, from various indications, and from none more than the recent debates on Reform of Parliament, that both Conservatives and Liberals (if I may continue to call them what they still call themselves) have lost confidence in the political creeds which they nominally profess, while neither side appears to have made any progress in providing itself with a better. Yet such a better doctrine must be possible; not a mere compromise, by splitting the difference between the two, but something wider than either, which, in virtue of its superior comprehensiveness, might be adopted by either Liberal or Conservative without renouncing any thing which he really feels to be valuable in his own creed. When so many feel obscurely the want of such a doctrine, and so few even flatter themselves that they have attained it, any one may without presumption, offer what his own thoughts, and the best that he knows of those of others, are able to contribute towards its formation.

All speculations concerning forms of government bear the impress, more or less exclusive, of two conflicting theories respecting political institutions; or, to speak more properly, conflicting conceptions of what political institutions are.  By some minds, government is conceived as strictly a practical art, giving rise to no questions but those of means and an end. Forms of government are assimilated to any other expedients for the attainment of human objects. They are regarded as wholly an affair of invention and contrivance. Being made by man, it is assumed that man has the choice either to make them or not, and how or on what pattern they shall be made. Government, according to this conception, is a problem, to be worked like any other question of business. The first step is to define the purposes which governments are required to promote. The next, is to inquire what form of government is best fitted to fulfill those purposes. Having satisfied ourselves on these two points, and ascertained the form of government which combines the greatest amount of good with the least of evil, what further remains is to obtain the concurrence of our countrymen, or those for whom the institutions are intended, in the opinion which we have privately arrived at. To find the best form of government; to persuade others that it is the best; and, having done so, to stir them up to insist on having it, is the order of ideas in the minds of those who adopt this view of political philosophy. They look upon a constitution in the same light (difference of scale being allowed for) as they would upon a steam plow, or a threshing machine.  To these stand opposed another kind of political reasoners, who are so far from assimilating a form of government to a machine, that they regard it as a sort of spontaneous product, and the science of government as a branch (so to speak) of natural history. According to them, forms of government are not a matter of choice. We must take them, in the main, as we find them. Governments can not be constructed by premeditated design. They \"are not made, but grow.\" Our business with them, as with the other facts of the universe, is to acquaint ourselves with their natural properties, and adapt ourselves to them. The fundamental political institutions of a people are considered by this school as a sort of organic growth from the nature and life of that people; a product of their habits, instincts, and unconscious wants and desires, scarcely at all of their deliberate purposes. Their will has had no part in the matter but that of meeting the necessities of the moment by the contrivances of the moment, which contrivances, if in sufficient conformity to the national feelings and character, commonly last, and, by successive aggregation, constitute a polity suited to the people who possess it, but which it would be vain to attempt to superinduce upon any people whose nature and circumstances had not spontaneously evolved it.  It is difficult to decide which of these doctrines would be the most absurd, if we could suppose either of them held as an exclusive theory. But the principles which men profess, on any controverted subject, are usually a very incomplete exponent of the opinions they really hold. No one believes that every people is capable of working every sort of institution. Carry the analogy of mechanical contrivances as far as we will, a man does not choose even an instrument of timber and iron on the sole ground that it is in itself the best. He considers whether he possesses the other requisites which must be combined with it to render its employment advantageous, and, in particular whether those by whom it will have to be worked possess the knowledge and skill necessary for its management. On the other hand, neither are those who speak of institutions as if they were a kind of living organisms really the political fatalists they give themselves out to be. They do not pretend that mankind have absolutely no range of choice as to the government they will live under, or that a consideration of the consequences which flow from different forms of polity is no element at all in deciding which of them should be preferred. But, though each side greatly exaggerates its own theory, out of opposition to the other, and no one holds without modification to either, the two doctrines correspond to a deep-seated difference between two modes of thought; and though it is evident that neither of these is entirely in the right, yet it being equally evident that neither is wholly in the wrong, we must endeavour to get down to what is at the root of each, and avail ourselves of the amount of truth which exists in either.  Let us remember, then, in the first place, that political institutions (however the proposition may be at times ignored) are the work of men--owe their origin and their whole existence to human will. Men did not wake on a summer morning and find them sprung up. Neither do they resemble trees, which, once planted, \"are aye growing\" while men \"are sleeping.\" In every stage of their existence they are made what they are by human voluntary agency. Like all things, therefore, which are made by men, they may be either well or ill made; judgment and skill may have been exercised in their production, or the reverse of these. And again, if a people have omitted, or from outward pressure have not had it in their power to give themselves a constitution by the tentative process of applying a corrective to each evil as it arose, or as the sufferers gained strength to resist it, this retardation of political progress is no doubt a great disadvantage to them, but it does not prove that what has been found good for others would not have been good also for them, and will not be so still when they think fit to adopt it.  On the other hand, it is also to be borne in mind that political machinery does not act of itself. As it is first made, so it has to be worked, by men, and even by ordinary men. It needs, not their simple acquiescence, but their active participation; and must be adjusted to the capacities and qualities of such men as are available. This implies three conditions. The people for whom the form of government is intended must be willing to accept it, or, at least not so unwilling as to oppose an insurmountable obstacle to its establishment. They must be willing and able to do what is necessary to keep it standing. And they must be willing and able to do what it requires of them to enable it to fulfill its purposes. The word \"do\" is to be understood as including forbearances as well as acts. They must be capable of fulfilling the conditions of action and the conditions of self-restraint, which are necessary either for keeping"]]]
