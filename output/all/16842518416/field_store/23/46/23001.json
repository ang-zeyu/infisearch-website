The majestic dignity which he knew how to bestow upon it, made his figure, though it did not exceed middle height, appear taller; and the self-confident smile which rested on his full lips, as he was sure of a speedy triumph, well beseemed a general whose sword and brain had gained the most brilliant victories.  Adrian had seen him thus more than once after battles had been won or when he had unhorsed some strong antagonist in the tournament, but it was many a long year ago.  He felt as though a miracle was wrought before his eyes, and, deeply loved, kissed his master's sleeve.  Charles noticed it, and, as if in token of gratitude, patted him lightly on the shoulder.  This was not much, but it made the faithful fellow happy. How long it was since the last time his imperial aster had gladdened him by so friendly a sign of satisfaction!  Were the days to return when, in the Netherlands, Charles had condescended to treat even humble folk with blunt familiarity?  Adrian did not doubt that he should learn speedily enough what had caused this unexpected change; but the discovery of the real reason was now far from his alert mind, because he was still confident that the Emperor's heart had for years been closed against the charms of woman. Nevertheless, the experienced man told himself that some woman must be connected with this amazing rejuvenation. Otherwise it would surely have been one of the wonders which he knew only from legends.  And lo!  Chamberlain de Praet was already announcing a lady--the Marquise de Leria.  If Master Adrian had ever permitted himself to laugh in his master's presence, it would certainly have happened this time, for the curtseying old woman in velvet, silk, and plumes, whose visit his Majesty did not refuse, was probably the last person for whose sake Charles endured the satin shoe on his sensitive foot.  How oddly her round, catlike head, with its prominent cheek bones, and the white wig combed high on the top, contrasted with the rouged, sunken cheeks and eyebrows dyed coal black!  Adrian hastily calculated that she was not far from seventy.  But how tightly she laced, how erect was her bearing, how sweet the smile on her sunken mouth!  And how did her aged limbs, which must have lost their flexibility long ago, accomplish with such faultless grace the low curtseys, in which she almost touched the floor?  But the valet, who had grown gray in Charles's service, had witnessed still more surprising things, and beheld the presence of royalty bestow strength for performances which even now seemed incomprehensible.  The lame had leaped before his eyes, and feeble invalids had stood erect long hours when the duties of the court, etiquette, the command of royalty, compelled them to do so.  What a mistress in ruling herself the marquise had become during her long service at the French and Netherland courts! for not a feature betrayed her surprise at the Emperor's altered appearance while she was thanking him fervently for the favour of being permitted to share the meal with the august sovereign, which had bestowed so much happiness upon her.  Charles cut this speech short, and curtly requested her to take under her charge, in his royal sister's place, a young lady of a noble family.  The marquise cast a swift glance of understanding at the Emperor, and then, walking backward with a series of low bows, obeyed the sovereign's signal to leave him.  Without any attempt to conceal from the valet the strong excitement that mastered him, Charles at last impatiently approached the window and looked down into the Haidplatz.  When his master had turned his back upon him, Adrian allowed himself to smile contentedly.  Now he knew all, and therefore thought, for the first time, that a genuine miracle had been wrought in the monarch.  Yet it gave him pleasure; surely it was a piece of good fortune that this withering trunk was again putting forth such fresh buds.     CHAPTER XIV.  Wolf Hartschwert had asked the guards who were stationed at the end of Red Cock Street whether any riders had passed them.  Several horses always stood saddled for the service of the court. Malfalconnet mounted his noble stallion, and Count Lanoi, the equerry, gave his companion a good horse and furnished two mounted torch-bearers.  But the Emperor's envoys had not far to ride; halfway between the abbey of Prufening and Ratisbon, just outside the village of Dcchbetten, they met the returning excursionists.  Barbara's voice reached Wolf from a considerable distance.  He knew the playmate of his childhood; her words never sounded so loud and sharp unless she was excited.  She had said little on the way out, and Herr Peter Schlumperger asked what had vexed her.  Then she roused herself, and, to conquer the great anxiety which again and again took possession of her, she drank Herr Peter's sweet Malmsey wine more recklessly than usual.  At last, more intoxicated by her own vivacity than by the juice of the grape, she talked so loudly and freely with the other ladies and gentlemen that it became too much even for Frau Kastenmayr, who had glanced several times with sincere anxiety from her golden-haired favourite to her brother, and then back to Barbara.  Such reckless forwardness ill beseemed a chaste Ratisbon maiden and the future wife of a Peter Schlumperger, and she would gladly have urged departure.  But some of the city pipers had been sent to the forest, and when they began to play, and Herr Peter himself invited the young people to dance, her good humour wholly disappeared; for Barbara, whom the young gentlemen eagerly sought, had devoted herself to dancing with such passionate zest that at last her luxuriant hair became completely loosened, and for several measures fluttered wildly around her.  True, she had instantly hastened deeper into the woods with Nandl Woller, her cousin, to fasten it again, but the incident had most unpleasantly wounded Frau Kastenmayr's strict sense of propriety.  Nothing unusual ought to happen to a girl of Barbara's age, and the careless manner in which she treated what had befallen her before the eyes of so many men angered the austere widow so deeply that she withdrew a large share of her favour.  This was the result of the continual singing.  Any other girl would fasten her hair firmly and resist flying in the dance from one man's arm to another's, especially in the presence of a suitor who was in earnest, and who held aloof from these amusements of youth.  Doubtless it was her duty to keep her brother from marriage with a girl who, so long as her feet were moving in time to the violins and clarionets, did not even bestow a single side glance upon her estimable lover.  So her displeasure had caused the early departure.  Torch-bearers rode at the head of the tolerably long train of the residents of Ratisbon, and some of the guests carried cressets.  So there was no lack of light, and as the lantern in her neighbour's hand permitted the baron to recognise Barbara, Malfalconnet, according to the agreement, rode up to the singer, while Wolf accosted Herr Peter Schlumperger, and informed him of the invitation which the steward, in the Emperor's name, was bringing his fair guest.  The Ratisbon councillor allowed him to finish his explanation, and then with quiet dignity remarked that his Majesty's summons did not concern him.  It rested entirely with jungfrau Blomberg to decide whether she would accept it at so late an hour.  But Barbara had already determined.  The assent was swift and positive, but neither the light of the more distant torches nor of the lantern close at hand was brilliant enough to show the baron how the girl's face blanched at the message that the Emperor Charles did not command, but only humbly entreated her to do him a favour that evening.  She had with difficulty uttered a few words of thanks; but when the adroit baron, with flattering urgency, besought her to crown her kindness and remember the saying that whoever gives quickly gives doubly, she pressed her right hand on her throbbing heart, and rode to Frau Kastenmayr's side to explain briefly what compelled her to leave them, and say to her and her brother a few words of farewell and gratitude.  Herr Peter replied with sincere kindness; his sister with equally well- meant chilling displeasure.  Then Barbara rode on with the two envoys, in advance of the procession, at the swiftest trot.  Her tongue, just now so voluble, seemed paralyzed.  The violent throbbing of her heart fairly stopped her breath.  A throng of contradictory thoughts and feelings filled her soul and mind.  She was conscious of one thing only.  A great, decisive event was imminent, and the most ardent wish her heart had ever cherished was approaching its fulfilment.  It is difficult to talk while riding rapidly; but Malfalconnet was master of the power of speech under any circumstances, and the courtier, with ready presence of mind, meant to avail himself of the opportunity to win the favour of the woman whose good will might become a precious possession.  But he was not to accomplish this, for, when he addressed the first question to Barbara, she curtly replied that she did not like to talk while her horse was trotting.  Wolf thought of the loud voice which had reached him a short time before from the midst of the Ratisbon party, but he said nothing, and the baron henceforward contented himself with occasionally uttering a few words.  The whole ride probably occupied only a quarter of an hour, but what a flood of thoughts and feelings swept in this short time through Barbara's soul!  She had just been enraged with herself for her defiance and the reckless haste which perhaps had forever deprived her of the opportunity to show the Emperor Charles her skill as a singer.  The cruel anxiety which tortured her on this account had urged her at Prufening to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5563"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Volume 03 (#5)"],["body","forwardness which hitherto she had always shunned.  She had undoubtedly noticed how deeply this had lowered her in Frau Kastenmayr's esteem, and the discovery had been painful and wounded her vanity; but what did she care now for her, for her brother, for all Ratisbon?  She was riding toward the great man who longed to see her, and to whom--she herself scarcely knew whence she gained the courage--she felt that she belonged.  She had looked up to him as to a mountain peak whose jagged summit touched the sky when her father and others had related his knightly deeds, his victories over the most powerful foes, and his peerless statesmanship.  Only the day before yesterday she had listened to Wolf with silent amazement when he told her of the countries and nations over which this mightiest of monarchs reigned, and described the magnificence of his palaces in the Netherlands, in Spain, and in Italy.  Of the extent of his wealth, and the silver fleets which constantly brought to him from the New World treasures of the noble metal of unprecedented value, Barbara had already heard many incredible things.  Yet, during this ride through the silent night, she did not even bestow the lightest thought upon the riches of the man who was summoning her to his side.  The gold, the purple, the ermine, the gems, and all the other splendours which she had seen, as if in a dream, hovering before her at the first tidings that she was invited to sing before the Emperor Charles, had vanished from her imagination.  She only longed to display her art before the greatest of men, whose \"entreaty\" had intoxicated her with very different power from the Malmsey at Herr Peter's table, and show herself worthy of his approval.  That the mightiest of the mighty could not escape pain seemed to her like a mockery and a spiteful cruelty of Fate, and at the early mass that day she had prayed fervently that Heaven might grant him recovery.  Now she believed that it was in her own hands to bring it to him.  How often had she been told that her singing possessed the power to cheer saddened souls!  Surely the magic of her art must exert a totally different influence upon the man to whom her whole being attracted her than upon the worthy folk here, for whom she cared nothing.  She, ay, she, was to free his troubled spirit from every care, and if she succeeded, and he confessed to her that he, too, found in her something unusual, something great in its way, then the earnest diligence which Master Feys had often praised in her would be richly rewarded; then she would be justified in the pride which, notwithstanding her poverty, was a part of her, like her eyes and her lips, and for which she had so often been blamed.  She had always rejected coldly and unfeelingly the young men who sought her favour, but with what passionate yearning her heart throbbed for the first person whom she deemed worthy of it, yet from whom she expected nothing save warm sympathy for the musical talents which she held in readiness for him, earnest appreciation which raised her courage, and also, perhaps, the blissful gift of admiration!  Never had she rejoiced so gleefully, so proudly, and so hopefully in the magic of her voice, and she also felt it as a piece of good fortune that she was beautiful and pure as the art with which she expected to elevate and cheer his soul.  Transported out of herself, she did not heed the starry heavens above her head, at which she usually gazed with so much pleasure--Wolf had taught her to recognise the most beautiful planets and fixed stars--nor at the night birds which, attracted by the torches of the horsemen riding in advance, often darted close by her, nor the flattering words to which she was wont to listen willingly, and which few understood how to choose better than the well-trained breaker of hearts at her side.  The envoys had taken care that the city gate should be kept open for them.  Not until the hoofs of her gray horse rang upon the pavement did Barbara awake from the dream of longing which had held her captive.  She started in alarm, raised her little plumed cap, and drew a long breath. The ancient, well-known houses along the sides of the streets brought her back to reality and its demands.  She could not appear before the Emperor just as she was, in her riding habit, with disordered hair.  Besides, her head was burning after the dancing and the wine which she had drunk.  She must calm herself ere entering the presence of the royal connoisseur whose approval could render her so happy, whose dissatisfaction or indifference would make her wretched.  Quickly forming her resolution, she turned to Malfalconnet and explained that she could not appear before his Majesty until after she had allowed herself a short period of rest; but the baron, who probably feared that some feminine caprice would spoil, even at the twelfth hour, the successful issue of his mission, thought that he must deny this wish, though in the most courteous manner and with the assurance that he would procure her an opportunity to collect her thoughts quietly in the Golden Cross.  Barbara unexpectedly wheeled her horse, struck him a blow with the whip, and called to the astonished gentlemen, \"In front of the Golden Cross in a quarter of an hour.  You, Wolf, can wait for me at the Grieb.\"  The last words were already dying away as she clashed swiftly up the street and across the Haidplatz.  Bright sparks flashed from the paving stones struck by her horse's hoofs.  \"Confounded witch!\"  cried Malfalconnet.  \"And how the unruly girl wheels her horse and sits erect in her wild career over the flagstones!  If the gray falls, it will do her no harm.  Such rising stars may drop from the skies, but they will leap up again like the cats which I threw from the roof when a boy.  His Majesty will get something to trouble him if he continues his admiration.  Sacre Dieu!  What a temperament!--and a German!\"  Hitherto both had ridden on at a walk, gazing after Barbara, although she had already vanished in the darkness, which was illumined only by the stars in the cloudless sky.  Now the clock struck half-past ten, and Malfalconnet exclaimed, half to the young knight, half to himself, \"If only the wild bird does not yet escape our snare!\"  \"Have no fear,\" replied Wolf.  \"She will keep her promise, for she is truthfulness itself.  But you would oblige me, Herr Baron, if in future you use a tone less light in speaking of this young lady, who is worthy of every honour.  Her reputation is as faultless as the purity of her voice, and, obstinate as she may be----\"  \"So this masterpiece of the Creator finds much favour in your eves and your keen ears, Sir Knight,\" Malfalconnet gaily interrupted.  \"From any one else, my young friend, I should not suffer such a warning to pass; but we are now riding in the Emperor's precincts, so it would cause me sore embarrassment if my steel pierced you, for my neck, which is very precious to me, would then probably fall under the rude axe of the executioner.  Besides, I wish you well, as you know, and I understand you German pedants.  Henceforward--I swear it by all the saints!--I will utter no disrespectful word of your lovely countrywoman until you yourself release my tongue.\"  \"That will never be done!\" Wolf eagerly protested, \"and the mere supposition would force me to bare my sword, if it were not you----\"  \"If it were not sheer madness for your thumb-long parade dagger to cross blades with my good sword,\" laughed Malfalconnet.  \"Ere you drew your rapier, I think your lust for murder would have fled.  So let us leave our blades in their sheaths and permit my curiosity, to ask just one more question: What consideration induces you, Sir Knight, to constrain yourself to discreet peaceableness toward me, who, Heaven knows, excited your ire with no evil intent?\"  \"The same which restrains you from the duel with me,\" replied Wolf quietly; and then, in a warmer tone, continued: \"You are dear to me because you have shown me kindness ever since I came to the court.  But you are the last person who would admit that gratitude should fetter the hand which desires to defend itself.  In comparison with you, Baron, I am but an insignificant man, but noble blood flows in my veins as well as in yours, and I, too, am no coward.  Perhaps you suspect it because I have accepted many things from you which I would overlook from no one else. But I know that, however your jesting tongue sins against me, it has nothing to do with your disposition, whose kindness has ever been proved when the occasion offered.  But you are now denying respect to a lady--\"  \"From that, too, my heart is as far removed as the starry sky above our heads from the wretched pavement of this square,\" Malfalconnet interrupted.  \"Yes, Sir Knight, you judged me aright, and God save me from thinking or speaking evil of a lady who is so dear to the heart of a friend!\"  As he spoke he held out his right hand to his companion with gay yet stately cordiality.  Wolf eagerly clasped it, and directly after both swung themselves from their horses in the courtyard of the Golden Cross, Malfalconnet to inform the Emperor of the successful result of his ride, the Ratisbon knight to arrange for the proper stationing of the boy choir, and then, obedient to Barbarbara's injunction, to go to the Grieb.  He knew the baron, and was aware that any one whom this chivalrous gentleman assured of his friendship might rely upon it, but that he did not spare even the most sacred things if he might hope thereby to win the approval and arouse the mirth of his imperial master.  In the glad conviction that he had done his best for the woman he loved, and yet had not forfeited the favour of the influential man to whom he owed a debt of gratitude, whose active mind he admired, and who had, moreover, won his affection, he went to the neighbouring Grieb.  The favour which the Emperor showed Barbara seemed to him not only a piece"]]]
