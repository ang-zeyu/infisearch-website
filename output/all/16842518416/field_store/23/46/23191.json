No one would put you in such a category, and it is not a part of the work of a Christian to come into a circle as I have and engender harsh feelings, far from it.\"  \"Oh, no matter. We might talk again at another time, when I may be pleased to continue our remarks, but not tonight as I only intended remaining a short time, having an important engagement which I was compelled to make since I saw you last evening; so, if you will excuse me, I will wish you all good evening.\"  And so saying, the churchman, in not a very pleasant mood, withdrew.  Said Brown: \"Stranger, I am somewhat familiar with the doctrines of different Christian societies, and from the way you expressed yourself regarding the personality of God, I would like very much to hear your views regarding other differences. If the rest of your views are as reasonable as these you have given expression to, I should like very much to hear them, and you can now proceed without interruption. Do you differ from these ministers very much in other principles?\"  \"I am afraid the difference on many very important principles is just as great as the difference concerning the personality of God. But if you really desire to go with me in this search after the kingdom of God, and the others are willing, I assure you it will give me great pleasure.\"  Unanimous approval was expressed at once, and Mr. Brown continued, saying:  \"I never before had as great a desire in this direction, and must confess that my curiosity has become quite aroused.\"  \"Then,\" said Durant, \"we will take King James' translation of the Holy Scriptures as the law book, and 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God' for our text; and if we should discover before we have finished that the teachings of men differ greatly from the teachings of Christ, I will be somewhat justified in saying that religionists have 'transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.'\" (Isaiah xxiv: 5. Jeremiah ii: 13.)  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Brown, \"I will proceed,\" and obtaining the family Bible he continued: \"And should your assertions prove correct, it might perhaps account for the increase of infidelity, and it might also cause others as well as myself to stop and consider. Now, then, to the 'law and the testimony.' Give me the chapter and verse, that I may know you make no mistake.\"  The doctor then for the first time took part, saying: \"I am also becoming very much interested, and think I shall join you with my Bible. Let us all come into the circle.\"  \"All right, we will examine the Gospel of Jesus Christ from the Bible, principle by principle. In order to have a clear understanding concerning this, it will be necessary for us to go back to the days of our Father Adam. Through the transgression of our first parents, death came upon all the human family, and mankind could not, of themselves, overcome the same and obtain immortality. To substantiate this, see first, second and third chapters of Genesis, Romans 5th chapter and 12th verse, and I. Corinthians 15th chapter and 21st and 22nd verses. But in order that they should not perish, God sent His Son Jesus Christ into the world to satisfy this broken law and to deliver mankind from the power of death. (John iii: 16; Romans v: 8; John iv: 9.) And as all became subject to death by Adam, so will all men be resurrected from death through the atonement of Christ (I. Cor. xv: 20-23; Rom. v: 12-19; Mark xvi: 15, 16), and will stand before the judgment seat of God to answer for their own sins and not for Adam's transgression. (Acts xvii: 31; Rev. xx: 12-15; Matt. xvi: 27.) Am I right as far as I have gone?\"  \"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"I have been following you with your quotations, and find them correct. Proceed.\"  \"Then I have proved one of the principles of some of the so-called Christians incorrect, for they do not believe that the wicked will have the same chance of resurrection as the righteous. Jesus Christ did not die for our individual sins, only on condition that we conform to the plan He has marked out, which will bring us a remission of our sins. The only way we can prove that we love Him is by keeping His commandments (John xiv: 15); therefore, if we say we love God and keep not His commandments, we are liars and the truth is not in us. (I. John ii: 4.) I think I have proved to your satisfaction that there is something defective with their understanding of the attributes of God, and I think I can prove also that they do not keep His commandments. Christ has given us to understand two things which you must remember while on this search after the 'kingdom of God.' First, that we must follow Him; secondly, that when He left His disciples He was to send them the Comforter that would lead them into all truth; therefore we must follow Christ and accept all the principles which were taught by His disciples while in possession of the Holy Spirit, though it should prove the world to be in error.\"  \"Thus far your arguments are reasonable, also in accordance with Holy Writ; and as there is no other name given us except Jesus Christ whereby we can be saved (Acts iv: 12), you may now lay before us the conditions; but give us chapter and verse, as I said before, that we may know you speak correctly.\"  \"We will now examine into the conditions; but first remember that God does not send men into the world for the purpose of preaching contrary doctrines, for this always creates confusion, and God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. (I. Cor. xiv: 33.) Paul has said, if any man teach another gospel let him be accursed. (Gal. i: 8, 9.) The first condition is this: To believe there is a God (not the kind mentioned in the English prayer book), but the God that created man in His own image, and to have faith in that God and in Jesus Christ whom He has sent.  \"Go on,\" said the party in concert.  \"Well,\" continued Durant, \"the kind of faith required is that which will enable a man, under all circumstances, to say, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation.' (Rom. i: 16.) This is the kind of faith by which Noah prepared an ark; by which the worlds were framed; by which the Red Sea was crossed as on dry land; by which the walls of Jericho fell down; it was by this faith that kingdoms were subdued; righteousness was wrought; promises were obtained, and the mouths of lions were closed. (Heb. xi: 32, 38.) This faith comes by hearing the word of God (Rom. x: 14), and the lack of this faith, and the absence of prayer and fasting, caused even the apostles to be unsuccessful on one occasion in casting out devils. (Matt. xvii: 14, 20.) No wonder, then, that without faith it is impossible to please God. (Heb. xi: 6.) Faith, then, is the first grand and glorious stepping-stone to that celestial pathway leading towards the eternal rest. The more we search into eternal truth, the more we discover that God works upon natural principles. All the requirements which He makes of us are very plain and simple. How natural that the principle of faith should be the primary one of our salvation! With what principle are we more familiar? Faith is the first great principle governing all things; but great and grand as it is, it is dead without works. (James ii: 14-17.) We must not expect salvation by simply having faith that Jesus is the Christ, for the devils in purgatory are that far advanced (James ii: 19.) In fact if you will read the entire second chapter of James you will see that faith without works is as dead and helpless as the body after the spirit has taken its departure. It is utter folly to think of gaining an exaltation in His presence unless we obey the principles He advocated (Matt. vii: 21), for no one speaks truthfully by saying he is a disciple of Christ while not observing His commandments. (John viii: 31.) In fact, the only way by which man can truthfully say he loves Jesus Christ is by keeping His commandments.\" (John xiv: 12-21.)  \"Is it not recorded in Holy Writ,\" said the doctor, \"that if we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we will be saved?\"  \"You have referred to the words used by Paul and Silas to the keeper of the prison. These disciples were asked by this keeper what he should do to be saved, and was assured, as you have quoted, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.' Then the disciples immediately laid before them those principles which constituted true belief, and not until this man and his house had embraced the principles taught by these disciples were they filled with true belief and really rejoiced. (Acts xvi: 81-33.) You see by this example that we must not deceive ourselves by thinking that we can be hearers of the word only and not doers.\" (James i: 22,23.)  \"But, friend,\" said the lawyer, \"here is a passage found in the tenth chapter of Romans, which, in my opinion, will be extremely hard for you to explain. The passage referred to reads as follows: 'If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.' Now, then, it looks to me as if salvation is here promised through faith alone. How do you explain it?\"  \"Very easily. Let us thoroughly examine this passage in all its different phases. In the first place, this letter was written by Paul to individuals who were already members of the church. They had rendered obedience to the laws of salvation, and having complied with those requirements were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56685"],["title","Mr. Durant of Salt Lake City, \"That Mormon\" (#5)"],["body","to salvation providing their testimony remained within them like a living spring; and in order that they should not become lukewarm, Paul exhorted them to continue bearing testimony of the divinity of Christ, and not let their hearts lose sight of the fact that God had raised His Son from the dead, and inasmuch as they kept themselves in this condition, salvation would be theirs. This is the only sensible view one can take of this passage. Unquestionably, Paul was speaking to sincere members of the church, who had been correctly initiated into the folds of Christ, not aliens living 1800 years after.\"  \"That appears to be correct, and is satisfactory; but further on in the same chapter we find this expression: 'For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.' It appears to me here that reference is not made to those who had embraced the gospel and those who had the faith, but salvation is made general to whomsoever shall call upon the name of the Lord.\" (Rom. x: 13.)  \"Exactly, but the next verse gives an explanation so simple that none can fail to understand it: 'How, then, shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how shall they hear without a preacher? So, then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.' In other words, if there is faith, there have been works, and having true faith, no person will remain in that condition without complying with further works of salvation to which that faith urges him.\"  \"I see, I see,\" said Brown, the others remaining silent, but interested; \"you are right, but I never looked at the matter in that way before.\"  \"Now, then, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Durant: \"I maintain as before stated, that faith is the first principle of the gospel leading to salvation, but it will not bring us to the top of the glorious gospel ladder without the other principles.\"  \"Well, suppose we accept this as the first round in the gospel ladder, where will we find the second?\"  \"To explain this question involves, perhaps, some little time, and as it must be near the 'witching hour' of midnight, I would not care to be responsible for extending the sitting beyond, or even up to, that time. To give this information is, in some measure, my errand among you, and if desired I shall be pleased to meet with you again. Before leaving I hope to be able to address the citizens publicly, and will do so if a suitable place can be obtained.\"  Both the doctor and the lawyer were disposed to remonstrate against adjournment, and there seemed to be none who were not willing to remain and hearken unto that which to them was somewhat in the nature of an awakening, notwithstanding, as stated, it was growing late, and the exercises had been purely colloquial. It might be mentioned that only the more important parts of the conversation have been produced here--for the reproduction of everything in the nature of mere colloquy, the auxiliary questions, answers and suggestions, would make this a large book instead of a small one. Besides, the full conversation would be no more interesting for the particular object to which this book is devoted than would the matter reported.  The visitors took their departure with evident regret, albeit their interest in the occasion was more attributable to unsatisfied curiosity than to concurrence in all that the stranger had said.  \"He can talk Bible by the yard,\" said one.  \"Yes, and show what it means better than a regular minister,\" said another.  \"He said he had a mission among us,\" chimed in a third; \"I wonder what it can be?\"  The parting on the veranda was one in which friendly feelings prevailed all around, and the meeting on the morrow, when the second of the grand fundamental principles of the gospel was to be explained, seemed uppermost in every mind.    CHAPTER V.  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES.  The audience had increased in numbers when the time for the continuance of the gospel exposition arrived. Rev. Fitzallen was not present; he had an engagement elsewhere, was the word he left; but his absence was compensated for by the presence of two or three others.  But little time was spent in formality, and a beginning was effected by our legal friend saying:  \"Mr. Durant, you closed last night with a definition of the first principle in the series of steps to be taken by the convert to Christianity, with a promise that tonight we should have the second explained. Will you now proceed to fulfill the promise?\"  \"Most willingly, if it is desired.\"  Unanimous approval was at once manifested, and the western man proceeded.  \"The second follows the first, just as naturally as the second step follows the first when a child learns to walk. When faith in God is once created, the knowledge that we have at some time, perhaps many times during our lives, done things displeasing to Him, naturally follows immediately, therefore repentance makes its appearance as the second principle of the gospel. When John came preaching in the wilderness, as the forerunner of Christ, his message to the people was, 'Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' (Matt. iii: 2.) When Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, it was with a message calling them to repentance. (Mark i: 15.) When He chose His disciples and began sending them forth, it was to call mankind to repentance. (Mark vi: 7-12.) When He upbraided the cities wherein the most of His mighty works were done, it was because they repented not. (Matt. xi: 20.) True repentance is that which will cause him who stole to steal no more; that which will keep corrupt communications from our mouths; that which will cause us to so conduct our walks through life as not to grieve the Spirit of God; that which will cause all bitterness, wrath, anger, and evil speaking to be put away from us, and will make us kind one to another, tender-hearted and forgiving even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven us. (Ephesians iv: 28-32.) When he who has committed a sin shall commit it no more, then he has repented with that Godly sorrow which worketh repentance to salvation, and not with the sorrow of the world, bringing with it death. (II. Cor. vii: 10.) When a sinner repents with such repentance more joy is found in heaven than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. (Luke xv: 7.) This, then, ladies and gentlemen, is the second round in the gospel ladder according to the plan given us by the Master, and without it, faith is of no substantial consequence whatever.\"  \"Your reasoning is both logical and just,\" said Brown, \"and no one can find fault with those doctrines. This world of ours would certainly be more pleasant if these teachings were followed, and when a person is filled with that kind of faith, and has truly repented with such repentance, it must be manifest that he is entitled to salvation.\"  \"But he must not stop at that,\" the speaker went on, \"there are other principles just as important, just as necessary, for him to obey. If I am in possession of enough faith to convince me that I have sinned against you, and the knowledge of this causes me sincerely to repent, I must not and cannot rest until I am satisfied I have your forgiveness for the wrong. So it is with sinning against God and His laws; He has marked out the path of repentance and it is our duty to follow that divine way until we arrive at the sacred altar of forgiveness. Sin must be forgiven before it can be wiped out, and God in His wisdom selected and placed in His Church water baptism, as spoken of last night, for this purpose. It is a means whereby man can receive forgiveness of sin.\"  \"And do you really believe that baptism brings forgiveness of sin?\" queried the lawyer.  \"Certainly, provided, however, honest faith and sincere repentance go before it, and the ordinance is administered in the proper way by one who is endowed with divine authority; otherwise I believe it is of no avail whatever.\"  \"It seems to me you surround the principle of baptism with more safeguards than anyone else of whom I have ever heard. Why so?\"  \"Perhaps I do, and yet it should not be the case. Every principle of the gospel should be well and carefully protected, and the failure on the part of man to do this is the main cause of so many different so-called plans of salvation existing among us today, when there should be only one true and perfect plan, as found in the days of Christ.\"  \"You are certainly giving me ample information on religious conditions. It does seem strange that there should be so many different roads, leading, as is claimed, in one direction. I declare, I never thought of that before.\"  \"Well, we will try to cover all those points before we finish. Let us examine this principle. Let us see if the idea of water baptism appears reasonable. The Lord has wisely and kindly selected this form of ordinance for the remission of sins. It was with this object in view that John advocated the principle. (Mark i: 4.) Peter promised it on the day of Pentecost. (Acts ii: 38.) Saul also received aid to arise and have his sins washed away. (Acts xxii: 16.) And so it was taught by different disciples as a means whereby God would forgive sins.\"  \"And as you have already stated, there are various modes of baptism among different sects. What is your method?\"  \"The only correct form, as stated before, is that explained in the Bible. Baptism was performed anciently by immersion, in fact no other mode was thought of until centuries after the day of Christ. The word baptize is from the Greek _baptizo_ or _bapto_, meaning to plunge or immerse, and such noted writers as Polybius, Strabo, Dion Cassius, Mosheim, Luther, Calvin, Bossuet, Schaaf, Baxter, Jeremy Taylor, Robinson, and others, all agree that with the ancients immersion, and no other form, was baptism. The holy record itself explains the mode so plainly that even a wayfaring man might"]]]
