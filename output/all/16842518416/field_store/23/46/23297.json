A flat, broad-brimmed hat sat squarely on his head, and as he held his arms straight down at his side, and as his cheeks bore little round daubs of red paint, Mr. Hepworth was exactly like a gigantic specimen of the nursery Noah.  He came across the deck with a staggering, uncertain motion, as if the ship were rolling and pitching about. His realistic acting made them all laugh, and when he dropped into a deck chair and, calling the steward, asked faintly for a cup of weak tea, Patty declared she believed she wouldn't go to Paris after all.  \"For I'm sure,\" she said, \"that I don't want to go wabbling across a deck and looking as ill and woebegone as you do.\"  Mr. Hepworth smiled at her. \"You'll have so many remedies and preventives given you,\" he said, \"and you'll be so busy pitching them overboard that you won't have time to be seasick. Really I don't believe you'll think of such a thing all the way over, let alone experiencing it.\"  \"You're a great comfort,\" said Patty heartily; \"you always tell me the most comforting things. Now everybody else declares that after I've been at sea for a day I'll be so ill that I won't care whether I live or die.\"  \"Nonsense,\" declared Mr. Hepworth; \"don't pay any attention to such croakings.\"  \"I agree with you,\" said Elise. \"I've made up my mind that I'm not going to be seasick, but I'm going to have a perfectly jolly time all the way across.\"  \"Of course you'll have jolly times,\" said Marian, who was in one of her doleful moods; \"but think of us who are left behind! We won't have any jolly time until you come back again.\"  \"Oh, I don't know!\" said Kenneth. \"Of course I'm devoted to these two girls, but I'm not going to let it blight my young existence and crush my whole career, just because I have to live without them for six months.\"  \"But you don't love Patty as I do,\" said Marian with a sigh, as she gazed at her adored cousin.  \"No, Marian, I don't,\" said Kenneth; \"not as YOU do, for I assume that you love her as a first cousin. Now my affection for Patty is more on the order of a grandmother's brother-in-law once removed. You can't be too careful about the exact type of attachment you feel for a young lady, and I think that expresses my regard for Patty. Now toward Elise I feel more like a great niece's uncle's brother-in-law. There is a very subtle distinction between the two, but I know that both girls are acutely aware of the exact kind and degree of my regard for them.\"  \"I am, anyway,\" said Patty; \"and I must say, Ken, that it's much easier to leave you, with that definite affection of yours, than it is to go away from Marian and leave her floundering in her deep and somewhat damp woe.\"  Marian vouchsafed a sad sort of smile, and said it was all very well for them to make fun of her, but she couldn't help missing Patty.  \"Nobody can help missing Patty,\" declared Mr. Hepworth; \"and for my part, if I find that I miss her very much I shall go straight over to Paris and bring her back.\"  \"I hope you will,\" cried Patty; \"that is, I hope you'll come over, and perhaps we can persuade you not to be in such a dreadful hurry to come back.\"  \"I had expected to run over in the early spring, anyway,\" said Mr. Hepworth carelessly, as if it were a matter of no moment; \"I want to do certain French sketches that I've had my mind on for some time.\"  \"Well, if you do come,\" said Elise cordially, \"come right to our house and I know we can put you up. The Farringtons are erratic, but always hospitable; and I hereby invite this whole crowd to visit us in Paris, either jointly or severally, whenever the spirit moves you.\"  \"If I find a spirit that can move me over to Paris, I shall come often,\" declared Kenneth; \"but I'm afraid I'm too substantially built to be wafted across the ocean in the clutches of any spirit.\"  Just then the notes of a bugle sounded clear and sweet from below.  \"That's the ship's bugler,\" declared Mr. Hepworth, \"and that's the bugle call for supper. Shall we go down and refresh ourselves?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" cried Patty, jumping from her nest of steamer rugs; \"I'm as hungry as a hawk.\"  But it somehow happened that all of the gay young crowd left the Upper Deck to go to the supper room before Patty and Mr. Hepworth started. He detained her for a moment while he said: \"Little girl, will you miss me while you're away?\"  \"Even if I expected to I wouldn't own up to it,\" said Patty, as she gave him a mischievous glance.  \"Why wouldn't you own up to it?\" Mr. Hepworth spoke quite seriously and looked intently at the pretty face before him, with its golden hair crowned by the shining green sea-wreath.  \"I don't know,\" said Patty slowly. She felt herself forced by his impelling gaze to raise her eyes to his, and for the first time it occurred to her that Mr. Hepworth felt more interest in her than she had ever suspected. \"I don't know why I wouldn't own up to it, I'm sure,\" she went on; \"in fact, now that I come to think of it, I believe I should own up to it.\"  \"Well, own it then. Tell me you will miss me, and will sometimes wish I might be with you.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Patty, laughing merrily, \"I only meant I would own it if it were true. Of course I sha'n't really miss you; there'll be so much to amuse and interest me that I sha'n't have time to miss anybody except papa and Nan.\"  \"That's just what I thought,\" said Mr. Hepworth.     CHAPTER V  GOOD-BYES   At last the day of sailing came. The steamer was to leave her dock at three o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and soon after two Patty went on board, accompanied by Nan and her father.  A crowd of friends had also gathered to bid Patty goodspeed, and besides these the Farringtons had many friends there to say good-bye to them.  With the exception of Marian, it was not a sad parting. Indeed it seemed rather a hilarious occasion than otherwise. This was partly because most of the persons concerned felt truly sorry to miss Patty's bright presence out of their lives, and feared that if they showed any regret the situation might become too much for them.  Hilda and Lorraine felt this especially, and they were so absurdly gay that it was quite clear to Patty that their gaiety was assumed. But she was grateful to them for it, for, as she had previously confided to Nan, she didn't want a weepy, teary crowd to bid her good-bye; she wanted to go away amid laughter and smiles.  As the brief hour before sailing passed, more and more people came to see them off, and Patty began to think that everybody she ever knew would be there.  Many of the friends brought gifts, and many had already sent fruit or flowers, both to the Farringtons and to Patty. Down in the dining-saloon a whole table was occupied with the gifts to their party, and more than a fair proportion of these belonged to Patty. She was quite bewildered, for sailing away from her native land was a new experience to her, and it had never occurred to her that it would include this elaborate profusion of farewell gifts.  There was a great basket of red roses from Winthrop Warner, and Bertha had sent a box of candy. Roger had sent candy, too, and Kenneth had sent a beautiful basket of fruit that seemed to include every known variety. Nor were the gifts only from Patty's intimate friends. She was surprised to learn how many of her acquaintances and relatives and casual friends had sent a token of good wishes for her voyage. The truth is that Patty was a general favourite and made friends with all whom she met.  Mr. Hepworth had once told her that she was a Dispenser of Happiness. If so, she was now reaping the reward, for her friends had surely showered happiness upon her.  And besides the table full of gifts there were many letters and telegrams in the ship's little post-office. These delighted Patty, too, and she laid the budget aside to enjoy after the trip had fairly begun.  Among the last to arrive was Mr. Hepworth. He brought no fruit or flowers, but he was followed by a messenger boy fairly staggering under the weight of his burden.  \"I knew, Patty,\" he said, \"that you'd have all the flowers and fruit and sweets you could possibly want, so I've brought you a different kind of gift.\"  \"There seems to be plenty of it,\" said Patty as she looked at the small boy. His arms were full of papers and magazines, which, as they afterward discovered, included every newspaper, magazine, and weekly periodical published in New York.  \"You know,\" said Mr. Hepworth, \"you can't get current reading matter after you start, and a good deal of this stuff you won't find in Paris, either; though you can get American publications there more easily than you can in London. But read what you want, Patty, and pitch the rest overboard.\"  The boy was directed to carry his load to Patty's stateroom and deposit it there. Patty thanked Mr. Hepworth for his thoughtful gift, and said she would read every word of it and probably carry a great deal of it ashore with her.  \"Come on, Patty,\" said Kenneth, \"we're going to see where your deck chairs are, so we can have a mental picture of just how you're going to look for the next week or so.\"  About a dozen merry young people trooped up the next deck and found the chairs that had been reserved for the Farrington party. But when Patty saw them she burst out laughing. The two that were intended for herself and Elise had been decorated in an absurd fashion. They were tied with ribbon bows and bunches and garlands of flowers. They were filled with fancy pillows, and tied on in several places were letters and small packages done up in paper.  \"They look like ridiculous Christmas trees,\" cried Patty. \"I'm crazy to open those bundles, for I know they're full of foolishness that you girls have rigged up for us.\"  \"Don't open them now,\" said Hilda, \"for we have to leave you and go ashore in a few moments."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5731"],["title","Patty in Paris (#6)"],["body",", Patty, you will write to us, won't you?\"  \"I rather think I will,\" cried Patty; \"you've all been so good to me I never could thank you enough if I wrote every day and all day.\"  \"Come with me, Patty,\" said Kenneth; \"I want to show you something up at this end of the ship.\"  So Patty went off with Kenneth, and when they were well away from the laughing crowd he drew a small box from his pocket and gave it to her, saying: \"Patty, you mustn't think I'm a sentimental fool, for I'm not; but I wish you'd wear that while you're away, and sometimes think of me.\"  Patty flashed a comical glance at him.  \"Good gracious, Ken,\" she exclaimed, \"it's an awful funny thing, this going away; it makes all your friends so serious and so afraid you'll forget them. Of course I shall think of you while I'm away.\"  \"Who else has been asking you to think of him?\" growled Kenneth; \"that ridiculous Hepworth, I suppose! Well, now look here, miss, you're to think of me twice to his once. Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes, I understand,\" said Patty demurely; \"and now may I look in the box before I promise to wear your gift? It might be a live beetle. I saw a lady once who wore a live beetle attached to a tiny gold chain. Oh, it was awful!\"  \"It isn't a live beetle,\" said Kenneth, smiling, \"but it is attached to a tiny gold chain. Yes, of course you may look at it, and if you don't like it you needn't wear it.\"  So Patty opened the box and discovered a little gold locket, set with tiny pearls and hanging from a slender gold chain. It was very graceful and dainty, and Patty's first impulse was one of delight. But as she looked up and met Kenneth's serious gaze she suddenly wondered if she were promising too much to say she would wear it.  \"What's inside of it?\" she inquired, as if to gain time.  \"Look and see.\"  Patty opened the locket and found it contained a most attractive picture of Kenneth's handsome, boyish face.  \"What a splendid likeness!\" she exclaimed; \"you're awfully good-looking, Ken, and I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll wear the locket with pleasure--sometimes, you know, not all the time, of course--until I find somebody who is handsomer than you, or--whom I like better.\"  \"Pooh,\" cried Kenneth, \"I don't care how often you replace it with a picture of a handsomer man, but, Patty, I don't want you to find any one you like better. Promise me you won't.\"  \"Oh, I can't promise that, Ken. Just think of the fascinating Frenchmen I shall probably meet, with their waxed moustaches and their dandified manners. How can I help liking them better than a plain, unvarnished American boy?\"  \"All right, my lady; if you set your affections on a French popinjay, I'll come over there and fight a duel with him. I know you're too sensible to look at those addle-pated dandies, but I wish you'd promise not to like anybody better than THIS plain, unvarnished American boy.\"  \"I won't promise you anything, Ken,\" said Patty, not unkindly, but with a gentle, definite air. \"I thank you for your locket. It is beautiful, and I do love pretty things. I'll wear it sometimes; let me see, to-day is Saturday; well, I'll wear it every Saturday; that will insure your being thought of at least once a week.\"  And with this Kenneth had to be content, for a roguish laugh appeared in Patty's eyes and he knew she would not treat matters seriously any further.  Dropping the locket in her little handbag, Patty turned to go back to the others.  \"But you're not keeping your promise,\" said Kenneth, detaining her.  \"What promise?\"  \"You said you'd wear the locket on Saturdays, and to-day is Saturday.\"  Patty was a little embarrassed. She knew if she went back to the group with the trinket hanging round her neck, every one would know at once that Kenneth had given it to her, and they would surmise far more than the simple, truth. And she was especially conscious that Mr. Hepworth would notice it, and would think it meant all Kenneth had wanted it to mean, which was far more than she had accepted it as meaning.  Kenneth saw her hesitation and stood watching her.  \"Wear it, dear,\" he said quietly; \"an old friend like myself has a perfect right to give you a little keepsake.\" Then Patty had an inspiration. She clasped the little chain about her neck and then tucked the locket down inside her collar so that it was entirely out of sight.  \"You little witch!\" cried Kenneth as she raised her laughing eyes to his; \"but at any rate you're wearing it, and that's all I asked of you.\"  \"Yes,\" said Patty; and, as gaily and unaffectedly as a child, she grasped Kenneth's hand and ran down the long deck to join the others.  Although determined to ignore the episode, Patty's cheeks bore a heightened colour and she let poor Kenneth severely alone, devoting her attention to the others.  But it was nearly time: for the last farewell to be said, and indeed some of the party had said good-bye and left the steamer.  And then again Patty was carried off for a little confidential talk at the other end of the deck, and this time it was by her father.  He seemed to have many final bits of advice to give her regarding the minutiae of her journey, her money matters, her relation toward the Farringtons, and her correct demeanour in many ways.  \"I'm not at all afraid to trust you out of my sight, Patty, girl,\" he said, \"for I have absolute faith in your common sense and your good judgment. I know you won't do anything wrong or unladylike, but I want to warn you, my little girl, not to get mixed up in any romantic adventures. You're altogether too young for that sort of thing, and I warn you I sha'n't allow you to be engaged to anybody for years and years to come.\" Patty laughed merrily at this. \"Indeed, papa,\" she said, \"nothing is further from my mind than any such performance as you suggest, and I haven't the slightest desire to think of being engaged until I'm at least as old as Nan. And anyway, I don't believe anybody would like me well enough to want to be engaged to me. Oh--that is--unless it might be Kenneth.\"  And then Patty told her father the whole story of Kenneth and the locket.  \"You did just right, Patty,\" said her father. \"Kenneth is a nice boy, but he is altogether too young, and you are, too, to attach any sentimental significance to his gift. Wear the locket if you want to, or when you want to, but let it be understood that it means nothing more than the merest friendly keepsake.\"  \"Yes, that's just what I think,\" said Patty, with an air of satisfaction at this prosaic settlement of the subject. \"Oh, papa, you're the only one I'm going to miss very much, you and Nan; but especially you.\"  \"I know it, my girl; we have been a great deal to each other all these years, and of course we shall miss each other. But the time will soon pass away, and since we have to part we must be brave about it, and we must not spoil the happiness of it by the sorrow of it.\"  \"Dear papa,\" said Patty, squeezing his hand, \"you are always so wise and good. That's just the point; we must not spoil the happiness by the sorrow, though that is what Marian is always trying to do. Poor Marian, she's such a pathetic creature; I wish she would cheer up.\"  \"I think she will, Patty. Nan and I are going to take her home with us and keep her for a fortnight or more, and we'll make her so gay that she'll forget you're gone.\"  \"Good for you, papa; that's lovely! You do think of the nicest things for people!\"  \"Well, now, chickabiddy, I suppose I'll have to leave you. Keep up a good heart and a spirit of cheerfulness. Stick to your sense of proportion and your sense of humor. Remember that the time will soon pass, and pass happily, too; and then you'll come sailing back to this very dock, and I'll be here waiting for you.\"  They rejoined the group and then the farewells began in earnest. Patty was embraced and kissed by all the girls, until Nan declared there would be nothing left for her to say good-bye to. The men shook hands and expressed hearty good wishes, and with one last kiss from her father Patty was left alone with the Farringtons.  As the steamer sailed away there was much waving of handkerchiefs and flags, and the friends on shore were kept in sight just as long as possible.  But when they could no longer be distinguished, Patty said: \"Come on, Elise; let's do something to occupy our minds, or I feel sure I shall cry like a baby in spite of my noble and brave resolutions.\"  \"All right,\" said Elise, \"I'm with you. Let's go down and put things to rights in our stateroom.\"  So down they went on their errand. The girls were to share the same stateroom, and as it was large and conveniently arranged, they were glad to be together. But as they entered the door they nearly fell over in astonishment, for sitting on the sofa, with his paws extended in welcome, was a very large, very white, and very fleecy \"Teddy Bear.\" In one paw he held a card on which was written:             Oh Patty dear,            Oh Elise dear,       We don't want you to go away;            But if you will,            Keep with you still       This merry little stowaway.     CHAPTER VI  THE OLD MA'AMSELLE   The girls laughed heartily over the Teddy Bear, and agreed that it was a delightful companion for their trip. Elise set him up on the little shelf above the washstand, and he gazed down upon them like a fat and good-natured patron saint. Patty named him Yankee Doodle, and gave him an American flag to hold; but Elise, not wishing to seem to slight the French nation, gave him a silken tri-colour of France to hold in his other paw. Apparently unprejudiced in his sympathies, Yankee Doodle held both flags, and continued to wear his jolly and complacent grin.  It was great fun for the girls to arrange their stateroom. As they expected to occupy it for the next ten days, they proceeded to make it as homelike as possible. They both had so many cabin bags and wall pockets and basket catchalls which had been parting gifts that it was difficult to find wall"]]]
