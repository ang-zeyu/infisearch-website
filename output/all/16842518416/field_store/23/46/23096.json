PREFACE.  Some apology is necessary on the part of one whose acquaintance with civic affairs is of such recent date, for presuming to stand forth as the champion of the fights and privileges of the City of London. No man of common spirit, however, could tamely submit to the insulting charges and coarse insinuations with which the Corporation has long been assailed by malevolent or ignorant individuals.  That the civic system is free from spot or blemish, no one in his senses would pretend to assert.  But it may honestly and truly be asserted that the Court of Aldermen have both the power and the inclination to amend whatever is defective, and to introduce whatever reforms are desirable, without the irritating and officious interference of the imperial legislature.  The system may not be perfect, for it is of human origin; but its administrators are men of upright character, practically conversant with the requirements of trade, and animated by am earnest desire to promote the interests of their fellow-citizens. Why, then, are they not intrusted with the honourable task of gradually improving the machinery of the civic government, and of completing the good work they have long since spontaneously inaugurated?  It might, perhaps, have been better had this pamphlet never taken form and substance.  A feeble advocate endangers, and oftentimes loses, the best possible cause; but still, out of the fulness of the heart the mouth will speak, and pour forth sentiments and feelings that no longer brook control.  This, at least, is the only excuse that can be offered for troubling the public with the opinions of a comparative novice.  7, LEADENHALL STREET, July 26th, 1858.    CONTENTS.  INTRODUCTORY SKETCH.

INTRODUCTORY SKETCH.  London under the Romans--Gilds--Burghs--Charter of William the Conqueror--Reflections--Subsequent Charters--City divided into Wards--Civic Hospitality--The Quo Warranto Case--Restoration of the Charter.  The first historical notice of the City of London occurs in that portion of the Annals of Tacitus which treats of the insurrection of Boadicea.  At that time it was a place much frequented by merchants, attracted partly by the natural advantages of the site, and partly by the vicinity of the Roman camp at Islington.  It is stated that 70,000 persons, of both sexes and of all ages, were massacred by that fierce heroine in London and at St. Albans; but it must not be supposed that the ordinary  population of those two towns could have formed so large an aggregate.  It is far more probable that numbers of old men, women, and children flocked thither from the neighbourhood, in the hope of escaping from the violence and rapine of the patriot army.  Their expectations,  however, were disappointed, as the Roman general deemed it more prudent to evacuate an untenable post, than to risk the dominion of the entire island on the event of a battle fought under adverse circumstances.  At the same time the slaughter of the inhabitants justifies  the inference that they were foreigners rather than natives, some being traders from Gaul, but the majority either Roman colonists or the followers and hangers-on of the stationary camp.  Indeed, it may be gathered from the description of Tacitus, that these traders were chiefly commissariat contractors and brokers or money-changers.  The Romans do not appear to have evinced a high order of commercial instinct, nor to have looked upon the development of trade as one of the chief objects of government.  Their mission was to overrun other nations, and to prevent them from indulging in internecine  warfare.  To them mankind are therefore indebted for the preservation of whatever civilization was then extant, and for stopping the retrogressive course of the human race.  This was particularly observable in their conquest of Greece and the kingdoms of Asia Minor, where incessant quarrels between rival cities and principalities had checked the progress of the arts, sciences, and literature.  Content to conquer in battle, and, as the just reward of their superior prowess, to impose tribute and a governor, they seldom interfered with local customs and usages.  Perhaps one great secret of their marvellous success was this systematic abstinence from intermeddling with the local administrations.  The principle of self-government  was never more fully appreciated than by this remarkable people, who, sending forth consuls, vice-consuls,  and prefects, yet left to the conquered the management of  their own affairs and the guardianship of their own interests.  Not even in the most corrupt days of the empire was it attempted to absorb the patronage of every department and province for the benefit of a few, under the pretext of imparting greater vigour to the administration of public affairs by centralization.  It was not deemed wise or necessary to constitute central boards for the direction of matters with which not a single member might, possibly, be acquainted.  They did not aim at an ideal perfection, but were satisfied with doing what was practicable, and with a large average of general prosperity.  To each civitas--corresponding to our phrase of \"city and county\"--was assigned the regulation of its own domestic policy, by means of annual magistrates, a chosen senate, and the general assembly of the free inhabitants.  Through this wise policy of non-interference, the City of London rapidly acquired wealth and importance, and before the evacuation of the island by the Romans, had attained a position of considerable grandeur.  The civic institutions of the Saxons were, indeed, admirably suited for the adaptation of the municipal customs bequeathed to them by their predecessors, and which became developed to their full proportions through the greater amount of individual liberty that prevailed among the Germanic races.  Of the purely Teutonic institutions, one of the most characteristic was that of Gilds.  Originally, a gild was nothing more than an association of ten families, for purposes of mutual protection and security.  By the custom of \"frankpledge,\" every freeman at the age of fourteen was called upon to give securities for his good behaviour. Gilds were therefore formed, binding themselves to produce the offender if any breach of the peace was committed by one of their members, or to give redress to the injured party.  To carry out these objects a small fund was raised, to which every one contributed; and thence was derived the name of the association: \"gildan,\" in Saxon, signifying to pay.  With a view to becoming better acquainted with one another, and to draw more closely the bands of friendship, convivial meetings were held at fixed periods, when a vast quantity of beer was quaffed in honour of the living, and to the memory of the dead.  In after-times this truly Saxon institution assumed greater proportions, and embraced both ecclesiastical and secular gilds.  Of the former it is unnecessary to make further mention, but the latter formed the germ of the present livery companies.  The earlier secular or mercantile gilds were associations of members of a particular trade or craft, for the purpose of maintaining and advancing the privileges of their peculiar calling.  The term was also applied to a district or \"soke,\" possessed of independent franchises, as in the case of the Portsoken Ward, which was anciently known as the Cnighten Gild.  A \"soke,\" or soca, it may be incidentally observed, was the territory in which was exercised the soca, or the privilege of hearing causes and disputes, levying fines, and administering justice within certain limits. The practice of gildating or embodying the aggregate free population of a town was of considerably later date.  In France and in Flanders, corporations and communes, or commonalties, appear to have existed in the middle of the eleventh century, but the earliest mention of the Corporation of London occurs in the second year of the reign of Richard I.  Availing himself of the king's absence in the Holy Land, his brother John, Earl of Moreton, anxious to acquire the co-operation of the city of London in his traitorous designs upon the crown, convened a general assembly of the citizens, and confirmed their ancient rights and privileges by a formal deed or charter.  It was then, for the first time, that the commonalty of the city was regularly and officially recognized as a corporate body.  The distinctive rights of a town corporation were the election of a council presided over by a mayor or bailiff, a common seal, a bell to convoke the citizens, and local jurisdiction.  But although it was not before the reign of Richard I. that the citizens of London were formed into a body corporate, they had enjoyed, as the inhabitants of a free burgh, the immunities and many essential privileges of a corporation, from the time of Edward the Confessor, if not of Alfred.  Without stopping to discuss the etymology of the word \"burgh,\" it may suffice to observe that at the period of the Conquest by far the greater part of the cities and towns of England were the private property of the king, or of some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5609"],["title","The Corporation of London, Its Rights and Privileges (#1)"],["body","or secular lord, on whom they had been conferred by royal grant.  These burghs, as they were called, were said to be held in demesne, and paid to their superior certain tolls, duties, and customs, levied on goods exposed for sale at markets and fairs.  The inhabitants were actually little better than villeins or serfs, and were entirely at the mercy of their feudal lord.  Immense, therefore, were the advantages possessed by the free burghs, such as London, which governed themselves, and compounded for all dues by the payment of a fixed annual sum.  These annual contributions were styled the \"farm,\" and, when perpetual, the burghs so compounding were said to be held at fee-farm of the king in capite, as was the case with London.  One of the chief privileges implied by this tenure was that of exercising an independent jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, administered by magistrates chosen by the burgesses.  It is supposed that criminal law was originally dispensed in the free gilds into which the city was divided, under the presidency of an alderman.  These divisions were afterwards called wards, and were analogous to the corresponding division of the shire into hundreds.  In each ward was held a court-leet, or ward-mote, dating from the time of Alfred, though the actual institution of wards by that name is no later than the reign of Edward I. Civil causes, in London at least, were tried before a peculiar tribunal, the president of which was probably the portreve, or, in minor causes, an alderman.  The Norman Conquest naturally suspended for a time all these privileges, and reduced all free towns to the level of burghs in demesne.  Desirous, however, to secure the good will of the citizens, William hastened to assure them of his protection, and to confirm their prescriptive rights and immunities.  Thus ran the gracious expression of the royal pleasure:--\"William the king greets William the bishop, and Godfrey the portreve, and all the burghers within London, French and English, friendly.  And I make known to you that I will that ye be law-worthy, as ye were in the days of King Edward. And I will, that each child be his father's heir after his father's days. And I will not suffer that any man command you any wrong. God keep you.\"  The import of this charter was to make the citizens \"free tenants,\" reserving to the king the seigniory, or proprietary title.  The epithet \"law-worthy\" is equivalent to a declaration that they were freemen, for in the feudal ages none other were entitled to the forms of law; while the right of heirship apparently exempted them from the rule of primogeniture which prevailed among the Norman conquerors;--it is probable, however, that this exemption did not long hold good. In other respects the citizens of London continued to be governed by their own laws and usages, administered by their own magistrates after the ancient and established forms.  A nucleus of liberty was thus preserved amidst the tyrannical usurpations of the Norman barons, and the bold burgesses many a time stoutly resisted the encroachments that were attempted to be made on their hereditary rights.  At all periods of English history, indeed, have the citizens of London stepped forward as the champions of freedom, and shown themselves the incorruptible guardians of the public interests.  Never at any time, however, was there greater necessity for a sturdy bulwark against the growing power of the oligarchy than at the present moment.  Little by little--or, rather, by rapid strides--does the Government seek to get within its grasp the control of every department of the commonwealth. To-day, the East-India Company is abolished, for the sake of the \"better government of India;\" to-morrow, the Corporation is to be \"reformed,\" for the \"better government\" of the City; the day after, some other long-established institution will be swept away. There is nothing so repugnant to a ministry as whatever savours of self-government; for how.  in that case can the \"Dowbs\" be provided for? So long as the citizens manage their own affairs, there is no patronage at the disposal of ministers to bestow on a faithful or a wavering partisan.  Young \"honourables\" and other needy scions of the governing classes have little ambition to undertake civic duties, while they are only onerous and expensive.  Let the wedge be first applied.  Let \"reform\" worm its way into the constitution of the Corporation, and then by degrees the whole edifice may gradually be subverted.  Stipendiary magistracies and paid offices of any kind, if not too laborious, are always acceptable for sons, nephews, cousins, and influential supporters.  The danger from this quarter is in truth greater than when Norman William had the island prostrate at his feet, and when the liberties of the City hung upon his word.  That word went forth to save and to preserve.  The stern warrior respected the rights of the industrious burgesses, and by his wisdom paved the way for the future greatness of the metropolis.  But theoretical and doctrinaire statesmen are willing to risk all for the sake of consistency to certain arbitrary first principles, which do not apply to the spirit of the British people.  The charter of William the Conqueror, the reader will have remarked, alludes in a very general manner to the liberties and privileges enjoyed by the City.  The first detailed and specific notice of their character occurs in the charter of Henry I.  In the early part of his reign, being anxious to fix himself securely in his seat, the usurper conveyed, or confirmed, a grant to the citizens to hold Middlesex to farm for the yearly rental of 300 pounds; to appoint their own sheriff and their own justiciar; to be exempt from various burdensome and vexatious taxes in force in other parts of the kingdom; to be free from all denominations of tolls, customs, passage, and lestage, throughout the kingdom and along the seaboard; and to possess many other equally important privileges.  This valuable charter was renewed by King Stephen, during whose stormy and troubled reign the metropolis enjoyed a degree of prosperity unknown to the rest of the kingdom. The comparative peace and security which distinguished the happy lot of the citizens of London, have been justly attributed to the maintenance of their ancient institutions, which may be said to have grown out of the habits, requirements, thoughts, and feelings characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race.  Nor were the Londoners unconscious of their power, or ungrateful to their benefactor.  It was chiefly through their influence and exertions that the empress was finally driven out of the kingdom, and Stephen established on the throne.  Henry II. confirmed the purport of preceding charters, and added some further immunities, concluding with the declaration that their ancient customs and liberties were to be held as of inheritance from the king and his heirs.  They became, therefore, the property of the citizens, and were bequeathed from father to son, as a cherished heirloom.  It is true that under Richard I. they were exposed to some extortion, for which they received ample amends during the reign of his weak and inglorious successor.  Not only did they obtain five different charters confirmatory of their ancient privileges, together with the restoration of the sheriffwick, usurped by the last three monarchs, but also the first formal recognition of the mayoralty.  These favours, however, did not render them untrue to the general interests of the nation, or betray them into a corrupt acquiescence with the absolute tendencies of the Crown.  At that time, as at all others, while duly reverencing the royal prerogatives, they resolutely opposed themselves to the undue aggrandizement of the kingly power at the expense of the other estates of the realm.  It was within the precincts of the City, at the metropolitan church of St. Paul's, that the articles of Magma Charta were first proposed and accepted by acclamation, the citizens binding themselves by oath to defend and enforce them with their lives.  Nor was it for themselves alone that they were prepared to shed their blood.  Their solicitude extended to all other cities and towns throughout the kingdom, for the preservation of whose free customs and immunities they expressly stipulated.  During the long feeble reign of Henry III., no fewer than ten charters were granted to the citizens of London.  In the thirty-first year of that monarch, the mayor and commonalty of the City of London are mentioned for the first time as a corporate body, possessing a common seal.  The reign of Edward I. was rendered memorable for the convocation of the first parliament of the freely-elected representatives of the people, for the purpose of voting the supplies necessary for the conduct of public affairs.  Previously to this, grants of money were usually obtained through the personal influence of the barons over the cities and towns held in demesne.  The burgesses, however, did not sit with the knights of shires, but apart by themselves, and, through loyalty or obsequiousness, assessed themselves in a contribution nearly one third greater than that granted by the barons and knights. The convenient precedent was not overlooked, and it became henceforth customary to expect the like liberality from subsequent parliaments. At this period, also, the principal divisions of the city were first denominated wards; these wards were presided over by an alderman, assisted by a council chosen by the inhabitants of each division.  In the twelfth year of his reign, Edward, incensed by what he considered the disrespectful conduct of the civic magistrates, disfranchised the city, and governed it for twelve years through means of a custos. The experiment, however, did not answer, and the king was glad to restore the liberties of the City on payment of a heavy fine. At a later period, the mayor and sheriffs successfully resisted a"]]]
