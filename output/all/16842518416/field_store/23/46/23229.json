She wished it was already morning that she might tell Flora all that had happened.     CHAPTER VIII  A TWILIGHT TEA-PARTY   It was late when Grace and Sylvia awoke the following morning, but they were down-stairs before the boys appeared. Mrs. Hayes greeted them smilingly, but she said that Flora was not well and that Mammy would take her breakfast to her up-stairs.  \"After breakfast you must go up and stay with her a little while,\" said Mrs. Hayes.  \"Why, Flora was never ill in her life,\" declared Ralph; \"what's the matter?\"  \"She is not really ill, but she fell over something last night and bruised her arm and shoulder, so that she feels lame and tired, and I thought a few hours in bed would be the best thing for her,\" explained Mrs. Hayes. \"Mammy doesn't seem to know just how it happened,\" she concluded.  Sylvia and Grace had talked over the \"ghost\" before coming down-stairs. Grace had tried best to convince Sylvia that she had really dreamed \"Lady Caroline,\" but Sylvia insisted that a figure in a wide plumed hat and a trailing gown had really stepped out of the closet.  \"The moon was shining right where she stood. I saw her just as plainly as I could see you when you sat up in bed,\" Sylvia declared. But both the girls agreed that it would be best not to say anything about \"Lady Caroline\" until they had told Flora.  After breakfast Mammy came to tell the visitors that Flora was ready to see them.  \"But jus' for a little while,\" she added, as she opened the door of Flora's chamber.  Flora was bolstered up in bed, and had on a dainty dressing-gown of pink muslin tied with white ribbons. But there was a bandage about her right wrist, and a soft strip of cotton was bound about her head.  \"Oh, girls! It's too bad that I can't help you to have a good time to-day,\" she said, \"and all because I was so clumsy.\"  Both the girls assured her that it was a good time just to be at the Hayes plantation.  \"Flora! There is a ghost! Just as you said! I saw it. Just about midnight,\" said Sylvia.  \"Truly!\" exclaimed Flora, in rather a faint voice.  \"Yes. And it was Lady Caroline. For it wore a big hat, like the one in the picture, and its dress trailed all about it,\" replied Sylvia.  \"Then I guess Grace will believe this is a haunted house,\" said Flora, a little triumphantly.  \"I didn't see it,\" said Grace. \"And, truly, I believe Sylvia just dreamed it.\"  Flora sat up in bed suddenly.  \"Sylvia did not dream it. I know she saw it,\" she declared.  \"Well, perhaps so. But I didn't,\" and Grace laughed good-naturedly; but Flora turned her face from them and began to cry.  \"After my being hurt, and--\" she sobbed, but stopped quickly.  Sylvia and Grace looked at each other in amazement.  \"It's because she is ill. And she's disappointed because you didn't see Lady Caroline,\" Sylvia whispered. In a moment Flora looked up with a little smile.  \"I am so silly,\" she said. \"You must forgive me. But I'm sure Sylvia did see--\"  \"I begin to think she did,\" Grace owned laughingly. She had happened to look toward the open closet and had seen certain things which made her quite ready to own that Flora might be right. But she was rather serious and silent for the rest of the visit. Before they left Flora's room Flora asked Sylvia not to tell anyone that she had seen a \"ghost.\" \"You see, the boys would laugh, and no one but me really believes the house is haunted,\" she explained.  Of course Sylvia promised, but she was puzzled by Flora's request.  It was decided that Ralph and Philip should ride back to Charleston that afternoon when Uncle Chris drove the little visitors home, and that Flora should stay at the plantation with her mother for a day or two.  Sylvia had enjoyed her visit. She had even enjoyed seeing the \"ghost,\" but she was sorry that she could not tell her mother and father of the great adventure. Nevertheless she was glad when the carriage stopped in front of her own home, and she saw Estralla, smiling and happy in the pink gingham dress, waiting to welcome her.  \"Sylvia, I'm coming over to-night. I've got something to tell you,\" Grace said, as the two friends stood for a moment at Sylvia's gate, after they had thanked Uncle Chris, and said good-bye to Sylvia's brothers.  Grace was so serious that Sylvia wondered what it could be. \"It isn't that Estralla is going to be sold right away, is it?\" she asked anxiously.  \"No. I'll tell you after supper,\" Grace responded and ran on to her own home.  Sylvia's mother and father were interested to hear all that she had to tell them about the corn-shucking, and of the wonderful cake with its palmetto flag. She told them about poor Dinkie, and what Philip had said: that Dinkie should not be sold away from her children, or whipped.  Mr. Fulton seemed greatly pleased with Sylvia's account of her visit. He said Philip was a fine boy, and that there were many like him in South Carolina.  They had just finished supper when Grace appeared, and the two little girls went up to Sylvia's room.  \"What is it, Grace?\" Sylvia asked eagerly. \"I can't think what you want to tell me that makes you look so sober.\"  Grace looked all about the room and then closed the door, not seeing a little figure crouching in a shadowy corner.  \"I wouldn't want anybody else to hear. It's about the ghost,\" she whispered. \"I know all about it. It was Flora herself! Yes, it was!\" she continued quickly. \"When we were in her room this morning I saw a big hat with a long feather on it, hanging on her closet door, and a long blue skirt, one of her mother's. They weren't there yesterday, for the door was open, just as it was to-day.\"  \"Well, what of that?\" asked Sylvia.  \"Oh, Sylvia! Can't you see?\" Grace asked impatiently. \"Flora dressed up in her mother's things, and then came up the stairs to our room. She was determined to make us think she had a truly ghost in her house. Then when you called out, she got frightened and stumbled on the stairs. You know we heard someone fall and cry out. Of course it was Flora. Nobody seems to know how she got hurt. The minute I saw that plumed hat I knew just the trick she had played. I knew there wasn't a ghost,\" Grace concluded triumphantly.  Sylvia felt almost disappointed that it had not really been \"Lady Caroline.\" She wondered why Flora had wanted to deceive them.  \"I don't think it was fair,\" she said slowly.  \"Of course it wasn't fair. I wouldn't have believed that a Charleston girl would do such a mean trick,\" declared Grace. \"Of course, as we were her company, we can't let her know that we have found her out.\"  \"Perhaps she meant to tell us, anyway,\" suggested Sylvia hopefully. \"I'm sure she did. She thought it would make us laugh.\"  \"Well, then why didn't she?\" asked Grace.  Sylvia's face clouded; she could not answer this question, but she was sure that Flora had not meant to frighten or really deceive them, and she wanted to defend her absent friend.  \"Well, Grace, we know Flora wouldn't do anything mean. And, you see, she got hurt, and so she's just waiting to get well before she tells us of the joke. You wait and see. Flora will tell us just as soon as we see her again.\"  There was a little note of entreaty in Sylvia's voice, as if she were pleading with Grace not to blame Flora.  \"I know one thing, Sylvia. You wouldn't do anything mean, if you are a Yankee,\" Grace declared warmly. \"What's that noise?\" she added quickly.  The room was shadowy in the gathering twilight, and the two little girls had been sitting near the window. As Grace spoke they both turned quickly, for there was a sudden noise of an overturned chair in the further corner of the room, and they could see a dark figure sprawling on the floor.  Before Sylvia could speak she heard the little wailing cry which Estralla always gave when in trouble, and then: \"Don't be skeered, Missy! It's nobuddy. I jes' fell over your doll-ladies.\"  \"Oh, Estralla! You haven't broken my dolls! What were you up here for, anyway?\" and Sylvia quite forgot all her plans to rescue Estralla as she ran toward her.  The \"doll-ladies,\" as the little darky girl had always called Sylvia's two china dolls which sat in two small chairs in front of a doll's table in one corner of the room, were both sprawling on the floor, their chairs upset, and the little table with its tiny tea-set overturned. Grace lit the candles on Sylvia's bureau, while Sylvia picked up her treasured dolls, \"Molly\" and \"Polly,\" which her Grandmother Fulton had sent her on her last birthday.  \"I wuz up here, jest a-sittin' an' a-lookin' at 'em, Missy,\" wailed Estralla. \"I never layed hand on 'em. An' when you an' Missy Grace comes in I da'sent move. An' then when I does move I tumbles over. I 'spec' now I'll get whipped.\"  \"Keep still, Estralla. You know you won't get whipped,\" replied Sylvia, finding that Molly and Polly had not been hurt by their fall, and that none of the little dishes were broken.  \"You ought to tell her mother to whip her. She's no business up here,\" said Grace.  \"Don't, Grace!\" Sylvia exclaimed. \"We don't get whipped every time we make a mistake. And Estralla hasn't anything of her own. Just think, your Uncle Robert can sell her away from her own mother. You said yourself that you didn't think that was fair.\"  Estralla had scrambled to her feet and now stood looking at the little white girls with a half-frightened look in her big eyes.  \"Oh, Missy! I ain't gwine to be sold, be I?\" she whispered.  Sylvia put her arm around Estralla's shoulders. \"No!\" she said, \"you shall not be sold. Now, don't look so frightened. We will have a tea-party for Molly and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],["title","Tales of Chinatown (#0)"],["body","OF CHINATOWN  By Sax Rohmer  1916      CONTENTS       THE DAUGHTER OF HUANG CHOW      KERRY'S KID      THE PIGTAIL OF HI WING HO      THE HOUSE OF GOLDEN JOSS      THE MAN WITH THE SHAVEN SKULL      THE WHITE HAT      TCHERIAPIN      THE DANCE OF THE VEILS      THE HAND OF THE MANDARIN QUONG      THE KEY OF THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN      THE DAUGHTER OF HUANG CHOW       I  “DIAMOND FRED”    In the saloon bar of a public-house, situated only a few hundred yards from the official frontier of Chinatown, two men sat at a small table in a corner, engaged in earnest conversation. They afforded a sharp contrast. One was a thick-set and rather ruffianly looking fellow, not too cleanly in either person or clothing, and, amongst other evidences that at one time he had known the prize ring, possessing a badly broken nose. His companion was dressed with that spruceness which belongs to the successful East End Jew; he was cleanly shaven, of slight build, and alert in manner and address.  Having ordered and paid for two whiskies and sodas, the Jew, raising his glass, nodded to his companion and took a drink. The glitter of a magnificent diamond which he wore seemed to attract the other's attention almost hypnotically.  “Cheerio, Freddy!” said the thick-set man. “Any news?”  “Nothing much,” returned the one addressed as Freddy, setting his glass upon the table and selecting a cigarette from a packet which he carried in his pocket.  “I'm not so sure,” growled the other, watching him suspiciously. “You've been lying low for a long time, and it's not like you to slack off except when there's something big in sight.”  “Hm!” said his companion, lighting his cigarette. “What do you mean exactly?”  Jim Poland--for such was the big man's name--growled and spat reflectively into a spittoon.  “I've had my eye on you, Freddy,” he replied; “I've had my eye on you!”  “Oh, have you?” murmured the other. “But tell me what you mean!”  Beneath his suave manner lay a threat, and, indeed, Freddy Cohen, known to his associates as “Diamond Fred,” was in many ways a formidable personality. He had brought to his chosen profession of crook a first-rate American training, together with all that mental agility and cleverness which belong to his race, and was at once an object of envy and admiration amongst the fraternity which keeps Scotland Yard busy.  Jim Poland, physically a more dangerous character, was not in the same class with him; but he was not without brains of a sort, and Cohen, although smiling agreeably, waited with some anxiety for his reply.  “I mean,” growled Poland, “that you're not wasting your time with Lala Huang for nothing.”  “Perhaps not,” returned Cohen lightly. “She's a pretty girl; but what business is it of yours?”  “None at all. I ain't interested in 'er good looks; neither are you.”  Cohen shrugged and raised his glass again.  “Come on,” growled Poland, leaning across the table. “I know, and I'm in on it. D'ye hear me? I'm in on it. These are hard times, and we've got to stick together.”  “Oh,” said Cohen, “that's the game, is it?”  “That's the game right enough. You won't go wrong if you bring me in, even at fifty-fifty, because maybe I know things about old Huang that you don't know.”  The Jew's expression changed subtly, and beneath his drooping lids he glanced aside at the speaker. Then:  “It's no promise,” he said, “but what do you know?”  Poland bent farther over the table.  “Chinatown's being watched again. I heard this morning that Red Kerry was down here.”  Cohen laughed.  “Red Kerry!” he echoed. “Red Kerry means nothing in my young life, Jim.”  “Don't 'e?” returned Jim, snarling viciously. “The way he cleaned up that dope crowd awhile back seemed to show he was no jug, didn't it?”  The Jew made a facial gesture as if to dismiss the subject.  “All right,” continued Poland. “Think that way if you like. But the patrols have been doubled. I suppose you know that? And it's a cert there are special men on duty, ever since the death of that Chink.”  Cohen shifted uneasily, glancing about him in a furtive fashion.  “See what I mean?” continued the other. “Chinatown ain't healthy just now.”  He finished his whisky at a draught, and, standing up, lurched heavily across to the counter. He returned with two more glasses. Then, reseating himself and bending forward again:  “There's one thing I reckon you don't know,” he whispered in Cohen's ear. “I saw that Chink talking to Lala Huang only a week before the time he was hauled out of Limehouse Reach. I'm wondering, Diamond, if, with all your cleverness, you may not go the same way.”  “Don't try to pull the creep stuff on me, Jim,” said Cohen uneasily. “What are you driving at, anyway?”  “Well,” replied Poland, sipping his whisky reflectively, “how did that Chink get into the river?”  “How the devil do I know?”  “And what killed him? It wasn't drowning, although he was all swelled up.”  “See here, old pal,” said Cohen. “I know 'Frisco better than you know Limehouse. Let me tell you that this little old Chinatown of yours is pie to me. You're trying to get me figuring on Chinese death traps, secret poisons, and all that junk. Boy, you're wasting your poetry. Even if you did see the Chink with Lala, and I doubt it--Oh, don't get excited, I'm speaking plain--there's no connection that I can see between the death of said Chink and old Huang Chow.”  “Ain't there?” growled Poland huskily. He grasped the other's wrist as in a vise and bent forward so that his battered face was close to the pale countenance of the Jew. “I've been covering old Huang for months and months. Now I'm going to tell you something. Since the death of that Chink Red Kerry's been covering him, too.”  “See here!” Cohen withdrew his arm from the other's grasp angrily. “You can't freeze me out of this claim with bogey stuff. You're listed, my lad, and you know it. Chief Inspector Kerry is your pet nightmare. But if he walked in here right now I could ask him to have a drink. I wouldn't but I could. You've got the wrong angle, Jim. Lala likes me fine, and although she doesn't say much, what she does say is straight. I'll ask her to-night about the Chink.”  “Then you'll be a damned fool.”  “What's that?”  “I say you'll be a damned fool. I'm warning you, Freddy. There are Chinks and Chinks. All the boys know old Huang Chow has got a regular gold mine buried somewhere under the floor. But all the boys don't know what I know, and it seems that you don't either.”  “What is that?”  Jim Poland bent forward more urgently, again seizing Cohen's wrist, and:  “Huang Chow is a mighty big bug amongst the Chinese,” he whispered, glancing cautiously about him. “He's hellish clever and rotten with money. A man like that wants handling. I'm not telling you what I know. But call it fifty-fifty and maybe you'll come out alive.”  The brow of Diamond Fred displayed beads of perspiration, and with a blue silk handkerchief which he carried in his breast pocket he delicately dried his forehead.  “You're an old hand at this stuff, Jim,” he muttered. “It amounts to this, I suppose; that if I don't agree you'll queer my game?”  Jim Poland's brow lowered and he clenched his fists formidably. Then:  “Listen,” he said in his hoarse voice. “It ain't your claim any more than mine. You've covered it different, that's all. Yours was always the petticoat lay. Mine's slower but safer. Is anyone else in with you?”  “No.”  “Then we'll double up. Now I'll tell you something. I was backing out.”  “What? You were going to quit?”  “I was.”  “Why?”  “Because the thing's too dead easy, and a thing like that always looks like hell to me.”  Freddy Cohen finished his glass of whisky.  “Wait while I get some more drinks,” he said.  In this way, then, at about the hour of ten on a stuffy autumn night, in the crowded bar of that Wapping public-house, these two made a compact; and of its outcome and of the next appearance of Cohen, the Jewish-American cracksman, within the ken of man, I shall now proceed to tell.     II  THE END OF COHEN    “I've been expecting this,” said Chief Inspector Kerry. He tilted his bowler hat farther forward over his brow and contemplated the ghastly exhibit which lay upon the slab of the mortuary. Two other police officers--one in uniform--were present, and they treated the celebrated Chief Inspector with the deference which he had not only earned but had always demanded from his subordinates.  Earmarked for important promotion, he was an interesting figure as he stood there in the gloomy, ill-lighted place, his pose that of an athlete about to perform a long jump, or perhaps, as it might have appeared to some, that of a dancing-master about to demonstrate a new step.  His close-cropped hair was brilliantly red, and so was his short, wiry, aggressive moustache. He was ruddy of complexion, and he looked out unblinkingly upon the world with a pair of steel-blue eyes. Neat he was to spruceness, and while of no more than medium height he had the shoulders of an acrobat.  The detective who stood beside him, by name John Durham, had one trait in common with his celebrated superior. This was a quick keenness, a sort of alert vitality, which showed in his eyes, and indeed in every line of his thin, clean-shaven face. Kerry had picked him out as the most promising junior in his department.  “Give me the particulars,” said the Chief Inspector. “It isn't robbery. He's wearing a diamond ring worth two hundred pounds.”  His diction was rapid and terse--so rapid as to create the impression that he bit off the ends of the longer words. He turned his fierce blue eyes upon the uniformed officer who stood at the end of the slab.  “They are very few, Chief Inspector,” was the reply. “He was hauled out by the river police shortly after midnight, at the lower end of Limehouse Reach. He was alive then--they heard his cry--but he died while they were hauling him into the boat.”  “Any statement?” rapped Kerry.  “He was past it, Chief Inspector. According to "]]]
