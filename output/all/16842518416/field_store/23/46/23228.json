Grace and Sylvia promptly declared that they were not at all tired, and that a ride was just what they would like best.  The plantation's \"big house,\" as the negroes called the owner's home, was the largest house Sylvia had ever entered. Its high piazza with the tall pillars was covered by a tangle of jessamine vines and climbing roses. The front hall led straight through the house to another piazza, which looked out over beautiful gardens and a tiny lake. Behind a thick hedge of privet were the cabins of the house servants. The negroes who did the work on the plantation, caring for the horses and cows, and working in the cotton fields, lived at some distance from the \"big\" house.  Mrs. Hayes came out on the piazza to welcome the party. She had come down from Charleston on the previous day. It seemed to Sylvia she had never seen so many negroes before in all her life. Neat colored maids were flitting about the house, colored men were at work in the garden, and colored children peered smilingly around the corner of the house.  A colored maid was told to look after Grace and Sylvia, and she led the way up the beautiful spiral staircase to a pleasant chamber overlooking the garden. There were two small white beds, with a little mahogany light-stand between them. On this stand stood a tall brass candlestick. There were two dressing-tables, and two small bureaus, and a number of comfortable chintz-covered chairs. The floor was of dark, shining wood, and beside each bed was a long, soft white rug.  Sylvia and Grace knew that this room had been arranged especially for any of Flora's young friends whom she might entertain, and they both thought it was one of the nicest rooms that anyone could imagine. The smiling colored maid brushed their hair, helped them into the fresh muslin dresses they had each brought, and when they were ready opened the door and followed them down the stairs where they found Flora awaiting them.  \"Luncheon is all ready,\" she said, and led the way into the dining-room, where Mrs. Hayes and Flora's two older brothers, Ralph and Philip, were waiting for them. The boys were tall, good-looking lads, and as they were in the uniform of the Military School of Charleston, of which they were pupils, Sylvia thought they must be quite grown up, although Ralph was only sixteen and his brother two years younger. They had ridden out on horseback from Charleston, and had just arrived.  Flora introduced them to Sylvia, and Grace greeted them as old acquaintances.  \"I suppose you girls are looking forward to the corn-shucking to-night?\" Ralph asked, with his pleasant smile, as he held Sylvia's chair for her to take her seat at the table, while Philip performed the same service for Grace.  \"Oh, my dear boy! You have betrayed Flora's surprise,\" said Mrs. Hayes. \"She had planned not to let the girls know about it until nightfall.\"  \"What is a 'corn-shucking'?\" questioned Sylvia; for she had always lived in a city and did not know much about farm or plantation affairs.  \"Shall I tell her, Flora?\" questioned Ralph, laughingly.  \"No! No, indeed! Wait, Sylvia, then it will be a surprise after all,\" responded Flora.  Sylvia smiled happily. She was sure that this visit was going to be even more delightful than when she had been Flora's guest in the early spring. There seemed to be so many things to do on a plantation, she thought.  The young people were all hungry, and enjoyed the roasted duck, with the sweet-potatoes and the grape jelly. Beside these there were hot biscuit and delicious custards. Sylvia had finished her custard when two maids brought a large tray into the room, and in a moment the little girls exclaimed in admiring delight; for the tray contained two doves, made of blanc-mange, resting in a nest of fine, gold-colored shreds of candied orange-peel, and an iced cake in the shape of a fort, with the palmetto flag on a tiny staff.  At the sight of their State flag both the boys arose from their seats and saluted.  \"That's the flag to fly over Charleston's forts!\" declared Ralph as he sat down.  After luncheon was over Mrs. Hayes advised the girls to lie down for a little rest before starting for their ride. But they all declared they were not tired, and there were so many things to see and enjoy at the plantation that Sylvia and Grace were delighted when Flora suggested that first of all they should go out through the garden to the negro quarters, stopping at the stables on their way for a look at the ponies.  Sylvia was ready before the other girls and stood on the piazza waiting. She was leaning against one of the vine-covered pillars that supported the piazza, and Ralph and Philip, who were sitting just around the corner, did not know she was there and could not see her. Sylvia could hear their voices, but did not at first notice what they were saying until the word \"Yankee\" caught her ear.  \"The first thing you know those northern Yankees will take our forts,\" she heard Philip say, and heard Ralph laugh scornfully as he responed: \"They can't do it, or free our slaves, either. Say, did you know Father was going to sell Dinkie; she's making such a fuss that I reckon she'll get a lashing; says she don't want to leave her children.\"  There was a little silence, and then the younger boy spoke.  \"I wish they wouldn't sell Dinkie. I hate to have her go. It isn't fair. Of course she feels bad to leave those little darkies of hers. Jove!\" and the boy's voice had an angry tone, \"Dinkie shan't be whipped! I won't have it. She used to be my mammy.\"  Suddenly Sylvia realized that she was listening, and ran down the steps toward the little lake which lay glimmering in the sun beneath the shade of the overhanging pepper trees. She ran on past the lake down a little path which led toward the pine woods. She no longer felt happy, and full of anticipations of the surprise in store at the corn-shucking. All she could think of was \"Dinkie,\" a woman who was to be sold away from her children, and who was to be whipped because she rebelled against the cruelty of her master.  \"It's because she's a slave,\" Sylvia whispered to herself. \"I hate slavery. My father said Yankees always fought for what was right. Why don't they fight against slavery?\" She quite forgot that Flora and Grace would wonder where she had gone, and be alarmed at her absence.  \"I do wish I could see Dinkie,\" she thought. \"I wish I could do something to help set every slave free.\" Then she remembered that Philip had declared that Dinkie should neither be sold nor whipped.  \"I like Philip,\" she declared aloud, and was surprised to hear a little chuckling laugh from somewhere behind her, and turned quickly to find a smiling negro woman close behind her.  \"I likes Massa Philip myse'f,\" declared the woman, \"an' I wishes I could see him jus' a minute,\" and her smile disappeared. \"I'se shuah Massa Philip won' let 'em sell Dinkie, or lash her either,\" and putting her apron over her face the woman began to cry.  \"He won't! I heard him say he wouldn't have it,\" Sylvia assured her eagerly. \"Don't cry, Dinkie,\" and she patted the woman's arm.  Dinkie let her apron fall and looked eagerly at Sylvia.  \"You'se the little Yankee missy, ain't you?\" she questioned. \"I hear say that Yankees don't believe in selling black folks.\"  \"They don't; I'm sure they don't. I'll run right back and tell Philip you want to see him,\" replied Sylvia. \"You stay right here by this tree,\" she added, pointing to a big live-oak.  \"Yas, Missy, I thanks you,\" replied the woman.  Sylvia ran back toward the house as fast as she could go. She could see the ponies standing before the house, a small negro boy holding their bridle-reins. The girls were on the steps waiting for her.  \"I mustn't let them know that Dinkie wants to see Philip,\" she thought, as the girls called out that they had been looking everywhere for her. At that moment the two boys came along the piazza.  \"Philip is going to teach you how to mount, and how to hold your reins, Sylvia,\" said Flora.  Grace and Sylvia were to ride the white ponies, and Flora was to ride a small brown horse which her mother usually rode.  Philip came slowly down the steps. He looked very sober, and Sylvia was sure that he was thinking about Dinkie. \"I don't believe he thinks slavery is right,\" she thought, as Philip raised his cap, and asked if she was ready to mount \"Snap,\" the pony which she was to ride.  Flora and Grace were already mounted, and trotted slowly off. Sylvia and Philip were alone on the driveway.  \"Dinkie wants to see you. She's waiting down by the oak, beyond the lake,\" said Sylvia. \"And don't let her be whipped,\" she added.  The boy looked up at her quickly.  \"Don't tell the girls that she sent for me,\" he replied. \"Dinkie shan't be whipped, or sold either.\" He did not thank Sylvia for her message, and she was glad that he did not. With a brief word of direction as to the proper manner of holding the reins, he turned toward the lake, and Sylvia's pony trotted slowly down the drive to where Flora and Grace were waiting.  Flora led the way past the stables, and down a broad path which led to the negro quarters. The ponies went at a slow pace, as Flora wanted to be sure that Sylvia was not afraid, and that she was enjoying her first ride.  \"The corn-shucking will be here,\" she said, pointing with her pretty gold-mounted whip to a number of corn-cribs. \"They will bring the corn in from the fields, and we will come down in good season.\"  \"And the moon will be full to-night,\" said Grace, beginning to sing:  \"'De jay-bird hunt de sparrer-nes',     All by de light of de moon.   De bee-martin sail all 'roun',     All by de light of de moon.   De squirrel he holler from de top of de tree;     Mr. Mole he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5696"],["title","A Yankee Girl at Fort Sumter (#7)"],["body","in de groun',   Oh, yes! Mr. Mole he stay in de groun'--'\"  Sylvia listened and smiled as she looked at the happy faces of her friends. But she could not forget Dinkie, and wondered if Philip could really protect the unhappy woman from a whipping, and prevent her being sold away from her children.  As they passed the cabins of the negroes the children ran out bobbing and smiling to their young mistress, and Flora called out a friendly greeting.  \"Father's going to sell a lot of those niggers,\" she said carelessly. \"They eat more than they're worth.\"  \"But won't their mothers feel dreadfully to let them go?\" ventured Sylvia. \"Of course they will,\" declared Grace, before Flora could respond. \"And I do think it's a shame. Did you know Uncle Robert is going to sell Estralla?\" she asked turning to Sylvia.  Sylvia's grasp on the reins loosened, and she nearly lost her seat on the broad back of the fat pony.  \"What for?\" she questioned, thinking to herself that Estralla should not be sold away from her home and mother if she, Sylvia, could prevent it.  \"Oh, Uncle's agent says she isn't of any use, and he can get a good price for her. He would have sold her last month if your mother had not taken her in. I expect Aunt Connie will be half crazy, for all her other children are gone,\" said Grace.  \"We mustn't ride too far this time,\" Flora interrupted, \"because it's Sylvia's first ride. Hasn't she done well? Do you suppose you can turn the pony?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" answered Sylvia, drawing the left rein so tightly that the little pony swung round before Flora had time to give a word of direction. As they were now headed toward home \"Snap\" went off at a good pace, well in advance of the others. It was all Sylvia could do to keep her seat, but she was not frightened, and when the pony raced up the driveway and came to a standstill directly in front of the piazza steps she was laughing with delight. For the moment she had quite forgotten Dinkie and Estralla.     CHAPTER VII  SYLVIA SEES A GHOST   \"It was splendid,\" declared Sylvia as Grace and Flora dismounted and the three little friends entered the house. Flora's black \"Mammy\" was waiting for them on the piazza.  \"Thar's some 'freshments fur yo' in de dinin'-room,\" she said; and the girls were glad for the cool milk and the tiny frosted cakes which a negro girl served them. Sylvia wondered if Flora ever did anything for herself; for there seemed to be so many negro servants who were on the alert to wait upon all the white people at the \"big house.\"  \"Come up to my room, girls, and rest until it's time to dress for supper,\" said Flora.  Flora's room was just across the hall from the one where Grace and Sylvia were to sleep. Instead of a small white bed like theirs there was a big bed of dark mahogany with four tall, high posts. The bed was so high that there was a cushioned step beside it. The portrait of a lady hung over a beautiful inlaid desk, and Flora pointed to it with evident pride.  \"That's my great-grandmother; and her father built this house. My mother says that she was Lady Caroline, and that she was so beautiful that whenever she went to Charleston people would run after her coach just to look at her,\" and Flora looked at her companions expectantly, quite forgetting that she had told them the story before.  \"Oh, Flora! Every time I come out here you tell me about your wonderful great-grand-mother,\" said Grace, \"and you used to tell me that her ghost haunted this house.\"  \"Well, it does,\" declared Flora.  Sylvia had never heard of Lady Caroline's ghost. \"Do tell me about it, Flora,\" she urged.  There was a wide cushioned seat with many pillows beneath the windows, and here the girls established themselves very comfortably.  \"Yes, tell Sylvia the story,\" said Grace, piling up several cushions behind her back. \"Of course it isn't true, but it's thrilling.\"  \"It is true,\" persisted Flora. \"My mother says that her own governess saw Lady Caroline's ghost. And that she had on the very hat she has on in the portrait, and the same blue dress and lace collar. You know there's a secret stairway in this house. It leads from one of the closets in your room down to a closet in my father's library and out-of-doors, and Lady Caroline's ghost always comes in that way.\"  Sylvia looked up at the beautiful pictured face with a little shiver. \"I guess that the governess dreamed it,\" she said.  \"Of course she did,\" declared Grace. \"I think you look like that picture, Flora,\" she added.  \"Well, whether you believe it or not, everybody knows that this is a haunted house,\" persisted Flora. \"Why, there is an account of it in a book.\"  But Grace shook her head laughingly. \"Flora, show Sylvia your lovely lace-work,\" she said.  Flora nodded, but Sylvia was sure that she was not pleased at Grace's refusal to believe in the ghost.  \"Mammy! Mam-m-e-e,\" called Flora, and in a moment the black woman stood bobbing and smiling in the doorway.  \"Bring my lace-work,\" said Flora.  \"Yas, Missy,\" and Mammy trotted across the room to a little table in the further corner and brought Flora a covered basket. She opened it and set it down in front of her little mistress.  \"Do's yo' want anyt'ing else, Missy Flora?\" she asked.  \"If I do I'll call,\" replied the little girl, and Mammy again disappeared.  The basket was lined with rose-colored silk, and there were little pockets all around it. In the centre lay a cushion on which was a lace pattern defined by delicate threads and tiny circles of pins. A little strip of finished lace was rolled up in a bit of tissue paper. Flora took off the paper. \"See, it is the jessamine pattern,\" she explained. \"My mother's governess was a Belgian lady, and she taught my mother how to make lace and my mother taught me.\"  \"I wish I could make lace,\" said Sylvia. \"It would be lovely to make some for a present for my mother.\"  \"Of course it would. I'll teach you this winter,\" promised the good-natured Flora; \"let me see your hands. You know a lace-maker's hands must be as smooth as silk, because any roughness would catch the delicate threads.\"  Sylvia's hands were still scratched and roughed from her fall in Miss Rosalie's garden and her scramble over the wall, and Flora shook her head. \"You'll have to wait awhile. And you must wear gloves every time you go out, and wash your hands in milk every night,\" she said very seriously. \"Now I'll show you my embroidery. Mam-m-e-e! Mam-m-e-e,\" and another basket was brought and opened. This basket was also lined with rose-colored silk, but the silk had delicate green vines running over it. On the inside of the cover, held in place by tiny straps, were two pairs of shining scissors with gold handles, a gold-mounted emery bag, shaped like a strawberry, an embroidery stiletto of ivory, and a gold thimble.  Flora lifted out the embroidery frame, and putting on her thimble took a few exact, dainty stitches in the collar.  \"What lovely work you can do, Flora!\" exclaimed Sylvia. \"Don't you ever play dolls?\" remembering her own cherished dolls in their small chairs in the corner of her room at home.  \"Oh, I used to,\" replied Flora, \"but since I began school at Miss Patten's I don't seem to care about dolls.\"  \"Flora can play on the harp,\" announced Grace.  \"Oh, only just a little,\" responded Flora quickly.  \"I think Flora can do more things than any girl I ever knew,\" declared Sylvia admiringly; \"and I was just thinking that the servants did everything in the world.\"  Flora laughed. \"You never lived on a plantation, or you couldn't think that. Why, my mother works more than Mammy ever did. She has to tell all the house darkies what to do, and see that all the hands have clothes, and that the fruits are preserved. Why, she's always busy,\" replied Flora. \"And of course ladies have to know how to do things,\" she concluded.  When Grace and Sylvia went to their own room Flora went with them. \"I'll show you where that secret staircase is,\" she said, and opening the closet door pressed on a broad panel which moved slowly.  \"There,\" and Flora drew Sylvia near so she could look down a dark narrow stairway.  \"But that isn't seeing a ghost,\" Grace said laughingly.  It was rather late when Mrs. Hayes led the way back to the house, and Grace declared that she was almost too sleepy to walk up-stairs. But Sylvia was not at all sleepy. After the colored girl had helped them prepare for bed, blown out the candle, and left the room, she lay watching the shadows of the moving vines on the wall. She wished she was at home, for who knew but that Estralla's master might sell her before she returned. Sylvia wondered what she could do to protect the little girl. \"I might hide her,\" she thought; but what place would be secure? Suddenly she remembered something that she had heard Captain Carleton say when she was eating luncheon on that unlucky trip to Fort Sumter. \"This fort could make South Carolina give up slavery,\" he had said. Why, then, of course Estralla would be perfectly safe if she was only at Fort Sumter, concluded the little girl, with a long sigh of relief. \"I must get her there just as soon as I get home,\" she decided.  Then suddenly Sylvia sat straight up in bed. The closet door had swung softly open, and a figure with a big hat and trailing dress stepped out. Sylvia was not frightened. \"It's the ghost,\" she whispered; and leaning across poked Grace, exclaiming: \"Grace! Look quick! here is Lady Caroline!\"  In an instant Grace was wide awake.  \"Where?\" she demanded, in a frightened voice, clutching Sylvia's hand.  \"Right there! By the closet door,\" said Sylvia. \"Oh! she's gone!\"  For as she looked toward the closet the figure had disappeared.  \"There, you waked me up for nothing. You dreamed it,\" declared Grace.  \"Oh, I didn't! Truly, I didn't. I haven't been asleep,\" Sylvia insisted. \"It is just as Flora said. There is a ghost.\" Just then both the girls heard a startled cry, and a sound as if something had fallen in the room under them.  \"What's that?\" "]]]
