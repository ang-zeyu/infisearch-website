After I get pretty well along in years,--I think I shall marry a college professor, or a great scientist. I do love brainy men.\"  \"Well, there are no brainy men in our set.\"  \"Oh, Mona, what a libel! Our boys,--somehow I never can think of them as men,--are quite brainy enough for their age. And at the present day, I'd rather have fun with Ken or Roger, just talking foolishness, than to discourse with this wise professor I'm talking about. But of course, I wouldn't marry Ken or Roger even if they wanted me to, which they don't.\"  \"Oh, yes, they do, Patty; everybody wants to marry you.\"  \"Don't be a goose, Mona; you know perfectly well that Roger is over head and ears in love with you. Of course, I'm mortally jealous, for he was my friend first, and you stole him away from me. But I'll forgive you if you'll let up on this foolish subject and talk about something interesting.\"  \"I will, Patty, if you'll tell me one thing. Don't you like Mr. Van Reypen very much?\"  \"Phil Van Reypen? Of course I do! I adore him,--I worship the ground he walks on! I think he's the dearest, sweetest chap I ever knew!\"  \"Would you marry him?\"  \"Not on your life! Excuse my French, Mona, but you do make me tired! NOW will you be good? We're nearly home and I had a lot of things I wanted to ask you, and here you've been and went and gone and wasted all our time! Foolish girl! Here we are at my house, and I thank you, kind lady, for bringing me safely home. If you'll let your statuesque footman see me in at my own door, I'll promise to dream of you all night.\"  The girls exchanged affectionate good-nights, and Patty ran up the steps and Louise let her in.  \"Nobody home?\" asked Patty, noting the dim lights in the rooms.  \"No, Miss Patty,\" answered Louise, \"Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield are not in yet.\"  \"Well, I'm not a bit sleepy, Louise, and I'm not going to bed now. I shall stay in the library for awhile,--perhaps until they come home.\"  Louise took Patty's wraps and went away, and Patty wandered around the library selecting a book to read. The girl was a light sleeper, and she often liked to read a while before retiring.  But after she had selected a book and arranged a cosy corner in a big easy-chair by a reading light, she still sat idle, with her book unopened.  \"I don't feel a bit like reading,\" she thought to herself; \"I do hate to come home from a party so early. Of course I could write some letters, but I don't feel like that, either. I feel like doing something frisky.\"  She jumped up and turned on more lights. Then, chancing to see herself in the long mirror, she bowed profoundly to the pretty reflected figure, saying: \"Good-evening, Miss Fairfield, how well you're looking this evening. Won't you sing a little for us?\"  Then she danced into the music-room, and sitting down at the piano, sang a gay little song.  Then she sang another, and then looking over some old music she came across the little song, \"Beware,\" that she had sung over the telephone to Kit Cameron. Naturally her thoughts turned to that young man, whom she had almost forgotten, and she wondered if he had met Elise yet.  \"That was quite a jolly little escapade,\" she said to herself; \"that young man certainly thought I was a little black-eyed beauty, and when he does see Elise, of course he'll think she's the one. I believe I'll call him up and mystify him a little more. It's all right, because I've really been introduced to him, and if he doesn't remember me, _I_ can't help it! Probably he'll be out anyway; but I'll have a try at it.\"  Returning to the library, Patty sat down at the telephone and called up Mr. Cameron's number.  His own gay, cheery self answered \"Hello,\" and Patty said in a shy little voice, \"Is this you, Mr. Cameron?\"  \"Bless my soul! if it isn't my fair Unknown, again!\"  \"Why do you call me, fair, when you know I'm dark?\"  \"Oh, fair in this case means bewitching and lovely. It doesn't stand for tow hair and light blue eyes! and neither do I!\"  \"But you said you liked blondes.\"  \"I used to, before I knew you.\"  \"But you don't know me.\"  \"Oh, but I do! I know you a whole heap better than lots of people who have seen you. There's something in a telephone conversation that discloses the real inner nature. It was dear of you to call me up to-night. You don't know how it pleases me!\"  \"Oh, I didn't do it to please you. But I'm all alone in my dungeon tower--\"  \"Wait a minute; what IS a dungeon tower?\"  \"Oh, don't quibble. Anyway, I'm all alone, and I simply had to have some one to speak to.\"  \"How did you know I'd be here?\"  \"Be there! Why, I assumed that you sat at your telephone every evening, waiting to see if I would call you!\"  \"You little rascal! That's exactly what I have done, but I don't see how you knew it. Are you still a captive princess?\"  \"Yes; they keep me on bread and water, and not very much of that.\"  \"Couldn't I come and try to liberate you?\"  \"No, Sir Knight. Alas, you would but be captured yourself.\"  \"But to be captured in such a cause, would be a glorious fate!\"  \"Oh, aren't you romantic! I really wish it were the Fifteenth Century, and you could come on a dashing charger, and rescue me with a rope ladder! I'm simply dying for an escapade!\"  \"All right; I'll be there in a few minutes!\"  \"No, no! it's just five centuries too late. Now, one can only meet people in humdrum drawing-rooms.\"  \"And do you think there's no romance left in the world?\"  \"_I_ can't find any.\" Naughty Patty put a most pathetic inflection in her voice, which touched Mr. Cameron's heart.  \"Look here, my lady,\" he said, \"there IS romance left in this old world, and we're IT! Now, this telephoning is all very well, but I'm determined to meet you face to face. And that before long, too.\"  \"Oh, you've been making inquiries about me. You know I forbade that.\"  \"No, you didn't; you only said I mustn't ask Central who telephoned. There was surely no harm in asking my cousin who called her up the other night. And very naturally she told me. So she's going to be the Fairy Godmother who will bring us together by the touch of her magic wand.\"  \"Oh, if you know who I am, the fun is all gone out of our escapade!\"  \"Not at all; the fun is only about to begin.\"  \"Then Marie did tell you all about me?\" And Patty's tones betokened disappointment.  \"She didn't need to tell me much about you. She told me your name, and the rest I want to know about you, I either know already or I shall learn for myself.\"  \"If you know my name, why don't you call me by it?\" And Patty had great difficulty to stifle her laughter.  \"May I call you by your first name?\"  \"Not as a regular thing, of course. But if you know it, you may use it just once. But you can only use it to say good-night. For this session is over now.\"  \"But I don't WANT to say good-night. I want to talk to you a long time yet.\"  \"Alas, that may not be. It is even now time for my jailers to visit my dungeon, and if they catch me at this foolish trick, they will probably reduce my allowance of bread and water. And so, if you're going to call me by name, you must do it quickly, for I'm going to hang up this receiver, as soon as I say good-night!\"  Patty's positive tones apparently carried conviction that she would do just as she said, for Mr. Cameron sighed deeply and responded, \"It is such a beautiful name it seems a pity to use it only once. But I know you mean what you say, so as your liege knight, fair lady, I obey. Good-night--Elise--\"  The name came slowly, as if the speaker wished to make the most of it, and Patty fairly thrust the receiver back on its hook as she burst into laughter. It surely was a joke on the young man! He had asked Marie who was her pretty brunette friend, and Marie had honestly thought he must mean Elise Farrington.  Patty was still giggling when her parents came in from a concert they had been attending.  \"What IS the matter, Patty?\" asked Nan. \"Why do you sit up here alone, grinning like a Chessy cat, and giggling like a school-girl? Were the Hepworths so funny that you can't get over it?\"  And then Patty told Nan and her father the whole story of Kit Cameron and the telephone.  Nan laughed in sympathy, but Mr. Fairfield looked a little dubious.  \"And I thought you a well-brought up young woman,\" he said,--half in earnest and half in jest. \"Do you think it's correct to telephone to strange young men? I'm shocked! that's what I am,--SHOCKED.\"  \"Fiddlesticks, Fred,\" said Nan; \"it's perfectly all right. In the first place, the man HAS been introduced to Patty. She met him at Miss Homer's.\"  \"But she telephoned BEFORE she met him,\" stormed Mr. Fairfield, for Patty had told the whole story.  \"But she didn't do it purposely,\" said Nan, impatiently. \"She got him on the wire by mistake. She couldn't help THAT. And, anyway, when he said he was Miss Homer's cousin, that made it all right. I think it's a gay little joke, and I'd like to see that young man's face when he meets Patty!\"  \"I shan't meet him,\" said Patty, pretending to look doleful; \"he hates tow-headed girls.\"  \"Well, you're certainly that,\" said her father, looking at her with pretended disapproval. \"I have to tell you the truth once in awhile, because everybody else flatters you until you're a spoiled baby.\"  \"Tow-headed, am I?\" and Patty ran to her father, and rubbed her golden curls against his own blond head. \"And, if you please, where did I inherit my tow? If I hadn't had a tow-headed father I might have been the poppy-cheeked brunette that everybody admires. It isn't fair for YOU to comment on MY tow-head!\"  \"That's so, Pattikins; and I take it all back,\" for Mr. Fairfield could never resist his pretty daughter's cajolery. \"You are a pretty little doll-faced thing, and I expect I'll have to forgive your very reprehensible behaviour.\"  \"I'm NOT a doll-face,\" said Patty, pouting; \"I shan't let you go until you take THAT back.\"  As Patty had her arms tightly round her father's neck, he considered it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5631"],["title","Patty's Suitors (#5)"],["body","better part of valour to take back his words. \"All right,\" he said, \"rather than be garroted,--I retract! You're a beautiful and dignified lady, and your notions of convention and etiquette are above reproach.\"  \"They're above YOUR reproaches, anyhow,\" returned Patty, saucily, and then she ran away to her own room.     CHAPTER IV  A PERFECTLY GOOD JOKE   Patty decided to do nothing in the matter of meeting Kit Cameron. She dearly loved a joke, and this seemed to her a good one. But she thought it would spoil it, if she made any move in the game herself. So she bided her time, and it was perhaps a week later that Marie Homer came to call on her.  As Marie hadn't the slightest notion that Patty was the girl her cousin had in mind, the subject was not mentioned until just before Marie left, when she asked Patty if she would come to her home the next week to a little musicale.  \"Not a big party,\" said Miss Homer, \"just a dozen or so really musical people to spend the evening. And I want you to sing, if you will. My cousin will be there,--the one who plays the violin.\"  \"I thought he detested society,\" said Patty, her eyes twinkling a little.  \"I don't know what's come over Kit,\" returned Marie, looking perplexed. \"He's been the funniest thing of late. He has some girl in his mind--\"  \"A girl!\" exclaimed Patty; \"I thought he scorned them.\"  \"Well, I can't make this out. It's awfully mysterious. I think I'll tell you about it.\"  \"Do,\" said Patty, demurely.  \"Two or three weeks ago,--in fact, it was the day after my valentine party,--Kit asked me which of my friends had telephoned me late the night before. You know he lives in the apartment just above ours, and it seems the wires were crossed or something, but he heard this girl's voice, and now he insists he wants to meet her. I don't think Elise Farrington has such a fascinating voice, do you?\" \"Elise!\" exclaimed Patty, in pretended surprise; \"what has SHE to do with it?\"  \"Why,\" explained Marie, \"Elise did call me up that night, to say she had left her scarf. But how Kit discovered that she was a red-cheeked brunette, is more than _I_ can understand. You can't know that from a voice, now, can you?\"  \"No,\" said Patty, decidedly, \"you CAN'T!\"  \"Well, then, a week or two went by, and I told Elise about this, but somehow I couldn't manage to get them together. Every time Elise came to our house, Kit would be away somewhere. But a few days ago I did manage to have them meet.\"  \"Did you?\" exclaimed Patty; \"for gracious sake, WHAT happened?\"  Marie looked a little surprised at Patty's excited interest, but she went on: \"Oh, it was AWFULLY funny. Elise looked lovely that day. She had just come in from skating, and her cheeks were red and her eyes sparkled, and her furs were SO becoming! I introduced Kit, and I could see he admired her immensely. There were several people there, so I left these two together. They were getting on famously, when Kit said to her, 'Are you still a Captive Princess?'  \"I didn't know what he meant, and Elise didn't either, for she looked perfectly blank, and asked him why he said that. And Kit told her she knew well enough why he said it, and Elise thought he must be crazy. However, they got along all right until Kit asked me to get Elise to sing. Now, you know Elise doesn't sing much; she has a nice little contralto voice, but she never sings for people. But do you know, she was perfectly willing, and she sang a little lullaby or something like that, rather sweetly, _I_ thought. But such a change came over Kit's manner! I don't know how to express it. He was polite and courteous, of course; but he seemed to have lost all interest in Elise.\"  \"But your cousin IS a sort of a freak, isn't he?\" said Patty, who was deeply interested in Marie's story.  \"Why, no, he isn't a freak. He's a musician, but he's an awfully nice chap, and real sensible. He hates society as a bunch, but he often likes an individual here and there, and when he does he can be awfully nice and friendly. But this whole performance was so QUEER. He wanted to meet Elise, and when he did, he admired her, I could see that; but when she sang, the light all went out of his face, and he looked terribly disappointed. The girl isn't a great singer, but why in the world should he expect her to be, or care so much because she isn't?\"  \"It IS strange!\" murmured Patty; \"how did Elise take it?\"  \"Oh, I don't think she minded much; she thinks the boy half crazy, anyway; asking her if she was a captive princess! And, of course, he didn't let HER see that he was disappointed in her voice. But I know Kit so well, that I can tell the moment he loses interest in anybody. I'm awfully fond of Kit,--we've grown up more like brother and sister than cousins.\"  \"What's he like? Has he any fun in him?\"  \"Well, he loves practical jokes,--that is, if they're not mean. He couldn't do a mean or unkind thing to anybody. But he likes anything out of the ordinary. Escapades or cutting up jinks. He and Beatrice,--that's my younger sister,--are always playing tricks on us, when she's at home. But it's always good-natured fun, so we don't mind. Oh, Kit's a dear; but you never can tell whether he's going to like people or not. He likes so very few.\"  \"But he liked Elise?\"  \"Oh, yes; in a general way. But, for some reason I can't make out, he was terribly disappointed in her.\"  \"And he's going to play at your musicale?\"  \"Yes; and I want you to sing. We have two or three other musicians, and it will really be rather worth while.\"  Patty hesitated. If she went to this party, and met Kit, all the mystery of her little romance with him would be ended. He would be more disappointed in her than he had been in Elise, for at least she conformed to his favourite type of beauty, and Patty was quite the reverse. She could sing, to be sure, but probably her voice would not charm him, when robbed of the glamour lent by the telephone.  \"Oh, DO say yes,\" Marie urged; \"it will be a nice party, and if I've left out any people you specially want, I'll invite them.\"  But Marie's list included all of Patty's set, and as she rather wanted to go, she finally decided to say yes.  \"Good for you!\" exclaimed Marie; \"now I know the party will be a success!\"  \"You always say that to me,\" said Patty, laughing. \"_I_ don't make parties a success.\"  \"Yes, you do,\" said Marie, in a tone of firm conviction; \"you're so nice, and pretty, and smiling, and always seem to have such a good time, that it makes everybody else have a good time.\"  \"What do you want me to sing?\"  \"I don't care at all. Make your own selections. I like you best, I think, in some of those sweet, simple ballads.\"  \"I rarely sing anything but ballads or simple music,\" said Patty, \"my voice isn't strong enough for operatic soaring.\"  \"Well, sing what you like, Patty, if you only come,\" and Marie went away, greatly elated at having secured Patty's consent to sing at her musicale.  Patty at once went to the piano, and began to look over her music. She smiled as she came across \"Beware,\" but she concluded that would not do for a regular program, though she might use it as an encore.  She made her selections with care, as she honestly wanted to do credit to Marie's musicale, and then, taking several pieces of music, she ran up to Nan's room to ask her final judgment in the matter.  \"You'll have a lot of fun out of this, Patty,\" said Nan, laughing, as she heard the whole story. \"When is it to be?\"  \"Friday night. Do you know, Nan, I'd like to play a joke on that boy, between now and then.\"  \"I think you are playing a joke on him,--and, besides, he isn't a boy.\"  \"No; Marie says he's about twenty-four. He's a civil engineer, besides being a musician. But, anyway, I've got him guessing. I'm glad Elise didn't take it to heart, that she wasn't the right girl,--but Marie says Elise thinks he's a freak, anyway. And, too, I believe he's not very nice to girls as a rule, so of course Elise won't want him. Oh, _I_'M the only girl in the world for him!\"  Patty pirouetted about the room on the tips of her toes, waving a sheet of music in either hand.  \"What a silly you are, Patty, with your foolishness!\"  Patty dropped on one knee at her stepmother's side, and clasping her hands, looked up beseechingly into the smiling face over her.  \"But you love silly, foolish little girls, don't you, Nancy Nan?\"  \"Yes, when they're you,\" and Nan patted the shining head at her knee.  \"Well, very few of them ARE me!\"  \"Thank goodness for that! I don't know what I'd do if you were a half a dozen!\"  \"You'd have just six times as much fun in your life!\" and Patty jumped up and began to sing the songs she had brought.  Then together they decided on the ones she should sing at the musicale.  Although Patty's voice was not very strong, it was sweet and true and had been carefully cultivated. She sang with much charm, and her music always gave pleasure. She never attempted anything beyond her powers, and so her songs, while selected with good taste, were not pretentious.  That evening, while Patty was fluttering around her room, pretending to get ready for bed, but really dawdling, she was moved to telephone once again to the young man who was fond of jokes.  \"It's you, is it?\" he almost growled, in response to her call.  \"Yes,\" said Patty, in a meek little voice; \"shall I go away?\"  \"Great jumping cows! NO! Don't go away, stay right where you are!\"  \"But I'm going away for ever,\" said Patty, moved by a dramatic impulse; \"my captors have found out that I'm holding communication with you, and they're going to take me away to another castle, and imprison me there.\"  \"Stop your fooling; I want to know who you are, and I want to know it quick! Do you hear THAT?\"  \"Yes, I hear,\" returned Patty, saucily, \"but I don't have to answer! And if you talk to me like that, I shall hang up this receiver.\"  \"I won't talk like that any more. But, do you know, I thought I had found you, and you turned out to be somebody else.\"  \"But"]]]
