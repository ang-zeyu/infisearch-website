It became more and more difficult for her to understand why she had left Loni's band and entered into relations for which she was not suited, and in which she could never, never be at ease or feel happy.  Nothing was lacking in this wealthy household, not even kindness and love.  Frau Sophia was indulgent and friendly, even when Kuni, whose heart and brain were occupied with so many other thoughts, neglected or forgot anything.  The matron's grandchildren, of whom she often had charge, soon became warmly attached to her.  While among the rope-dancers she had been fond of children, and many a little one who journeyed with the band held out its arms to her more joyously than to its own mother. There was something in her nature that attracted them.  Besides, her skilful hands could show them many a rare trick, and she could sing numerous songs new to the Schurstab boys and girls, which she had picked up here and there.  Then, too, she permitted many a prank which no one else would have allowed.  Her duties connected with the household linen and the poultry yard, its owner's pride, were so easily performed, that in her leisure hours she often voluntarily helped the housekeeper.  At first the latter eyed her askance, but she soon won her affection.  Both she and her mistress showed her as much attention as the gardener bestows upon a wild plant which he has transferred to good soil, where it thrives under his care.  She kept aloof from the servants, and neither man nor maid molested her. Perhaps this was due to foolish arrogance, for after they had learned from rumour that Kuni had danced on the tight rope, they considered themselves far superior.  The younger maids timidly kept out of her way, and Kuni surpassed them in pride and looked down upon them, because her free artist blood rebelled against placing herself on the plane of a servitor.  She did not vouchsafe them a word, yet neither did she allow any of them to render her even the most trivial service.  But she could not escape Seifried, the equerry of her mistress's eldest son.  At first, according to her custom, she had roused the handsome fellow's hopes by fiery glances which she could not restrain.  Now he felt that she cared for him, and in his honest fashion offered to make her his beloved wife; but she refused his suit, at first kindly, then angrily.  As he still persisted she begged the housekeeper, though she saw that matchmaking was her delight, to keep him away.  Even in March Frau Sophia thanked Lienhard for the new inmate of her household, who far exceeded her expectations.  In April her praise became still warmer, only she regretted that Kuni's pretty face was losing its fresh colour and her well-formed figure its roundness.  She was sorry, too, that she so often seemed lost in thought, and appeared less merry while playing with the children.  Lienhard and his young wife excused the girl's manner.  Comfortable as she was now, she was still a prisoned bird.  It would be unnatural, nay, suspicious, if she did not sometimes long for the old freedom and her former companions.  She would also remember at times the applause of the multitude.  The well-known Loni, her former employer, had besought him to win her back to his company, complaining loudly of her loss, because it was difficult to replace her with an equally skilful young artist.  It was now evident how mistaken the juggler had been when he asserted that Kuni, who was born among vagrants, would never live in a respectable family.  He, Lienhard, had great pleasure in knowing that the girl, on the road to ruin, had been saved by Frau Sophia's goodness.  Lienhard's father had died shortly after Kuni entered her new home. Every impulse to love dalliance, she felt, must shrink before this great sorrow.  The idea sustained her hopes.  She could not expect him to seek her again until the first bitterness of grief for the loss of this beloved relative had passed away.  She could wait, and she succeeded in doing so patiently.  But week after week went by and there was no change in his conduct.  Then a great anxiety overpowered her, and this did not escape his notice; for one day, while his young wife hung on his arm and added a few brief words of sympathy, he asked Kuni if she was ill or if she needed anything; but she answered curtly in the negative and hurried into the garden, where the children, with merry shouts, were helping the gardener to free the beds of crocuses and budding tulips from the pine boughs which had protected them from the frosts of winter.  Another sleepless night followed this incident.  It was useless to deceive herself.  She might as well mistake black for white as to believe that Lienhard cared for her.  To no one save his fair young wife would he grant even the smallest ray of the love of which he was doubtless capable, and in which she beheld the sun that dispensed life and light. She had learned this, for he had often met her in Frau Sophia's house since his father's funeral.  The child of the highway had never been taught to conceal her feelings and maintain timid reserve.  Her eyes had told him eloquently enough, first her deep sympathy, and afterward the emotions which so passionately stirred her heart.  Had the feelings which her glances were intended to reveal passed merely for the ardent gratitude of an impassioned soul?  Gratitude!  For what?  His lukewarm interest had tempted her from a free, gay life, full of constant excitement, into the oppressive, wearisome monotony of this quiet house, where she was dying of ennui.  How narrow, how petty, how tiresome everything seemed, and what she had bartered for it was the world, the whole wide, wide world.  As the chicken lured the fox, the hope of satisfying the fervent longing of her heart, though even once and for a few brief moments, had brought her into the snare.  But the fire which burned within had not been extinguished.  An icy wind had fanned the flames till they blazed higher and higher, threatening her destruction.  Frau Schurstab had made her attend church and go to the confessional. But the mass, whose meaning she did not understand, offered no solace to the soul which yearned for love alone.  Besides, it wearied her to remain so long in the same place, and the confession forced the girl, who had never shrunk from honestly expressing what she felt, into deception.  The priest to whom she was taken was a frequent visitor at the Schurstab house, and she would have died ere she would have confided to him the secret of her heart.  Besides, to her the feeling which animated her was no sin.  She had not summoned it.  It had taken possession of her against her will and harmed no one except herself, not even the wife who was so sure of her husband.  How could she have presumed to dispute with her the possession of Herr Lienhard's love?  Yet it seemed an insult that Frau Katharina had no fear that she could menace her happiness.  Could the former know that Kuni would have been content with so little--a tender impulse of his heart, a kiss, a hasty embrace?  That would do the other no injury.  In the circles whence she had been brought no one grudged another such things.  How little, she thought, would have been taken from the wealthy Katharina by the trifling gift which would have restored to her happiness and peace.  The fact that Lienhard, though he never failed to notice her, would not understand, and always maintained the same pleasant, aristocratic reserve of manner, she sometimes attributed to fear, sometimes to cruelty, sometimes to arrogance; she would not believe that he saw in her only a person otherwise indifferent to him, whom he wished to accustom to the mode of life which he and his friends believed to be the right path, pleasing in the sight of God.  Love, feminine vanity, the need of approval, her own pride--all opposed this view.  When the last snow of winter had melted, and the spring sunshine of April was unfolding the green leafage and opening bright flowers in the meadows, the hedges, the woods, and the gardens, she found the new home which she had entered during the frosts of February, and whose solid walls excluded every breath of air, more and more unendurable.  A gnawing feeling of homesickness for the free out-of-door life, the wandering from place to place, the careless, untrammelled people to whom she belonged, took possession of her.  She felt as though everything which surrounded her was too small, the house, the apartments, her own chamber, nay, her very clothing.  Only the hope of the first token that Lienhard was not so cold and unconquerable as he seemed, that she would at last constrain him to pass the barrier which separated them, still detained her.  Then came the day when, to avoid answering his question whether she needed anything, she had gone into the garden.  Before reaching the children, who were playing among the crocuses and tulips, she had said to herself that she must leave this house--it was foolish, nay mad, to continue to cherish the hope which had brought her hither.  She would suffer keenly in tearing it from her heart, but a wild delight seized her at the thought that this imprisonment would soon be over, that she would be free once more, entirely her own mistress, released from every restraint and consideration.  How rapturous was the idea that she would soon be roving through the fields and woods again with gay, reckless companions!  Was there anything more pleasurable than to forget herself, and devote her whole soul to the execution of some difficult and dangerous feat, to attract a thousand eyes by her bewitching grace, and, sustained by her enthusiasm, force a thousand hearts to throb anxiously and give loud applause as she flew over the rope?  Never had the children seen her more extravagantly gay than after her resolve to leave them.  Yet when, at a late hour, Kuni went to bed,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/559"],["title","Greenmantle (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]     Greenmantle  by John Buchan   Contents  1.

The Guns of the North     To Caroline Grosvenor  During the past year, in the intervals of an active life, I have amused myself with constructing this tale. It has been scribbled in every kind of odd place and moment—in England and abroad, during long journeys, in half-hours between graver tasks; and it bears, I fear, the mark of its gipsy begetting. But it has amused me to write, and I shall be well repaid if it amuses you—and a few others—to read.  Let no man or woman call its events improbable. The war has driven that word from our vocabulary, and melodrama has become the prosiest realism. Things unimagined before happen daily to our friends by sea and land. The one chance in a thousand is habitually taken, and as often as not succeeds. Coincidence, like some new Briareus, stretches a hundred long arms hourly across the earth. Some day, when the full history is written—sober history with ample documents—the poor romancer will give up business and fall to reading Miss Austen in a hermitage.  The characters of the tale, if you think hard, you will recall. Sandy you know well. That great spirit was last heard of at Basra, where he occupies the post that once was Harry Bullivant’s. Richard Hannay is where he longed to be, commanding his battalion on the ugliest bit of front in the West. Mr John S. Blenkiron, full of honour and wholly cured of dyspepsia, has returned to the States, after vainly endeavouring to take Peter with him. As for Peter, he has attained the height of his ambition. He has shaved his beard and joined the Flying Corps.     CHAPTER I. A Mission is Proposed   I had just finished breakfast and was filling my pipe when I got Bullivant’s telegram. It was at Furling, the big country house in Hampshire where I had come to convalesce after Loos, and Sandy, who was in the same case, was hunting for the marmalade. I flung him the flimsy with the blue strip pasted down on it, and he whistled.  “Hullo, Dick, you’ve got the battalion. Or maybe it’s a staff billet. You’ll be a blighted brass-hat, coming it heavy over the hard-working regimental officer. And to think of the language you’ve wasted on brass-hats in your time!”  I sat and thought for a bit, for the name “Bullivant’ carried me back eighteen months to the hot summer before the war. I had not seen the man since, though I had read about him in the papers. For more than a year I had been a busy battalion officer, with no other thought than to hammer a lot of raw stuff into good soldiers. I had succeeded pretty well, and there was no prouder man on earth than Richard Hannay when he took his Lennox Highlanders over the parapets on that glorious and bloody 25th day of September. Loos was no picnic, and we had had some ugly bits of scrapping before that, but the worst bit of the campaign I had seen was a tea-party to the show I had been in with Bullivant before the war started. [Major Hannay’s narrative of this affair has been published under the title of _The Thirty-nine Steps_.]  The sight of his name on a telegram form seemed to change all my outlook on life. I had been hoping for the command of the battalion, and looking forward to being in at the finish with Brother Boche. But this message jerked my thoughts on to a new road. There might be other things in the war than straightforward fighting. Why on earth should the Foreign Office want to see an obscure Major of the New Army, and want to see him in double-quick time?  “I’m going up to town by the ten train,” I announced; “I’ll be back in time for dinner.”  “Try my tailor,” said Sandy. “He’s got a very nice taste in red tabs. You can use my name.”  An idea struck me. “You’re pretty well all right now. If I wire for you, will you pack your own kit and mine and join me?”  “Right-o! I’ll accept a job on your staff if they give you a corps. If so be as you come down tonight, be a good chap and bring a barrel of oysters from Sweeting’s.”  I travelled up to London in a regular November drizzle, which cleared up about Wimbledon to watery sunshine. I never could stand London during the war. It seemed to have lost its bearings and broken out into all manner of badges and uniforms which did not fit in with my notion of it. One felt the war more in its streets than in the field, or rather one felt the confusion of war without feeling the purpose. I dare say it was all right; but since August 1914 I never spent a day in town without coming home depressed to my boots.  I took a taxi and drove straight to the Foreign Office. Sir Walter did not keep me waiting long. But when his secretary took me to his room I would not have recognized the man I had known eighteen months before.  His big frame seemed to have dropped flesh and there was a stoop in the square shoulders. His face had lost its rosiness and was red in patches, like that of a man who gets too little fresh air. His hair was much greyer and very thin about the temples, and there were lines of overwork below the eyes. But the eyes were the same as before, keen and kindly and shrewd, and there was no change in the firm set of the jaw.  “We must on no account be disturbed for the next hour,” he told his secretary. When the young man had gone he went across to both doors and turned the keys in them.  “Well, Major Hannay,” he said, flinging himself into a chair beside the fire. “How do you like soldiering?”  “Right enough,” I said, “though this isn’t just the kind of war I would have picked myself. It’s a comfortless, bloody business. But we’ve got the measure of the old Boche now, and it’s dogged as does it. I count on getting back to the front in a week or two.”  “Will you get the battalion?” he asked. He seemed to have followed my doings pretty closely.  “I believe I’ve a good chance. I’m not in this show for honour and glory, though. I want to do the best I can, but I wish to heaven it was over. All I think of is coming out of it with a whole skin.”  He laughed. “You do yourself an injustice. What about the forward observation post at the Lone Tree? You forgot about the whole skin then.”  I felt myself getting red. “That was all rot,” I said, “and I can’t think who told you about it. I hated the job, but I had to do it to prevent my subalterns going to glory. They were a lot of fire-eating young lunatics. If I had sent one of them he’d have gone on his knees to Providence and asked for trouble.”  Sir Walter was still grinning.  “I’m not questioning your caution. You have the rudiments of it, or our friends of the Black Stone would have gathered you in at our last merry meeting. I would question it as little as your courage. What exercises my mind is whether it is best employed in the trenches.”  “Is the War Office dissatisfied with me?” I asked sharply.  “They are profoundly satisfied. They propose to give you command of your battalion. Presently, if you escape a stray bullet, you will no doubt be a Brigadier. It is a wonderful war for youth and brains. But ... I take it you are in this business to serve your country, Hannay?”  “I reckon I am,” I said. “I am certainly not in it for my health.”  He looked at my leg, where the doctors had dug out the shrapnel fragments, and smiled quizzically.  “Pretty fit again?” he asked.  “Tough as a sjambok. I thrive on the racket and eat and sleep like a schoolboy.”  He got up and stood with his back to the fire, his eyes staring abstractedly out of the window at the wintry park.  “It is a great game, and you are the man for it, no doubt. But there are others who can play it, for soldiering today asks for the average rather than the exception in human nature. It is like a big machine where the parts are standardized. You are fighting, not because you are short of a job, but because you want to help England. How if you could help her better than by commanding a battalion—or a brigade—or, if it comes to that, a division? How if there is a thing which you alone can do? Not some _embusque_ business in an office, but a thing compared to which your fight at Loos was a Sunday-school picnic. You are not afraid of danger? Well, in this job you would not be fighting with an army around you, but alone. You are fond of tackling difficulties? Well, I can give you a task which will try all your powers. Have you anything to say?”  My heart was beginning to thump uncomfortably. Sir Walter was not the man to pitch a case too high.  “I am a soldier,” I said, “and under orders.”  “True; but what I am about to propose does not come by any conceivable stretch within the scope of a soldier’s duties. I shall perfectly understand if you decline. You will be acting as I should act myself—as any sane man would. I would not press you for worlds. If you wish it, I will not even make the proposal, but let you go here and now, and wish you good luck with your battalion. I do not wish to perplex a good soldier with impossible decisions.”  This piqued me and put me on my mettle.  “I am not going to run away before the guns fire. Let me hear what you propose.”  Sir Walter crossed to a cabinet, unlocked it with a key from his chain, and took a piece of paper from a drawer. It looked like an ordinary half-sheet of note-paper.  “I take it,” he said, “that your travels have not extended to the East.”  “No,” I said, “barring a shooting trip in East Africa.”  “H"]]]
