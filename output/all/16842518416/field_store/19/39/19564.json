The _leitmotif_ of hundreds of cartoons, caricatures and jokes was that the \"American money power\" had \"dragged\" us into the war.  _Simplicissimus_ epitomized German thoughts of the moment in a full-page drawing entitled \"High Finance Crowning Wilson Autocrat of America by the Grace of Mammon.\" The president was depicted enthroned upon a dais resting on bulging money-bags and surmounted by a canopy fringed with gold dollars.  A crown of shells and cartridges is being placed upon his head by the grinning shade of the late J. Pierpont Morgan.  In the background is the filmy outline of George Washington, delivering the farewell address.  Then, of a sudden, German press policy toward the United States underwent a radical change.  Silence supplanted abuse.  It became so oppressive and so profound as to be eloquent.  The purpose of this organized indifference soon became crystal-clear: on the one hand to bolster up German confidence in the innocuousness of American enmity, and, on the other, to slacken the United States’ war preparations by committing no \"overt act\" of word or deed designed to stimulate them. Bernstorff had by this time reached Berlin and there is reason to suspect that his was the crafty hand directing the new policy of ostensible disinterestedness in American belligerency.  The arrival of American naval forces in European waters; the inauguration of conscription; the far-reaching preparations for succoring our Allies with money, food and ships; the splendid success of the Liberty Loan; the presence of General Pershing and the headquarters staff of the United States Army in France; the enrollment of nearly ten million young men for military service; our ambitious plans for the air war; the girding up of our loins in every conceivable direction, that we may play a worthy part in the war--all these things have been either deliberately ignored in Germany, by imperious government order, or, when not altogether suppressed from public knowledge, been slurred or glossed over in a way designed to make them appear as harmless or \"bluff.\" Finally, in an \"inspired\" article which offered sheer affront to the large body of truly patriotic American citizens of German extraction, the _Cologne Gazette_ bade Germans to continue to pin their faith in \"our best allies,\" _i.e._, the German-Americans, who might be relied upon (quoth the semi-official Watch on the Rhine) to \"inject into American public opinion an element of restraint and circumspection which has already often been a cause of embarrassment to Herr Wilson and his English friends.\"  \"We may be sure,\" concluded this impudent homily, \"that our compatriots are still at their post.\"  Events have marched fast since America \"came in.\"  In Great Britain and France men of perspicacity are not quite so jubilant over the effects of the Russian revolution as they were three months ago.  They realize that the amazing cataclysm which began in Petrograd on March 13 warded off a treacherous peace between Romanoff and Hohenzollern, but also, alas! that it has effectually eliminated Russia as a fighting factor for the purposes of this year’s campaign. Englishmen and Frenchmen are only now beginning to comprehend the immeasurable task that confronts New Russia in the erection of a democratic state on the ruins of autocracy while faced by the simultaneous necessity of warring against an enemy in occupation of vast Russian territory.  To-day there is little inclination in London or Paris to underestimate the providential importance of American intervention.  The specter of dwindling manpower in both countries is of itself sufficient to cause them to gaze gratefully and longingly toward our untapped reservoir of human sinews.  _What is happening in chaotic and liberty-dazed Russia forces Englishmen and Frenchmen, however disconcerting to their pride, to acknowledge the absolute indispensability of American support_. There are many among them candid enough to admit that democracy’s horizon might now be perilously beclouded if the United States had refrained from playing a man’s part in the battle of the nations.  In Berlin, too, the true import of America’s decision is dawning upon government and governed alike.  Our Allies expect us to justify our world-wide reputation for speed and organizing capacity and to transfer our activities from the forum of Demosthenes to the field of Mars.  They are impressed by what we have already accomplished--I write on the day when the arrival of the first American army in France, well within three months of our entering the war, is officially announced.  But amid our remote isolation from the scene of the conflict, safeguarded by geographical guarantees that its consuming fires can hardly ever sear our own soil, Englishmen and Frenchmen wonder whether we are able to estimate the magnitude of the effort required of us if we are to rise to the majestic zenith of our potentialities.  Some of them, seemingly no wiser for their myopia of recent times, are frankly skeptical on that point.  It is our bounden duty, as I am sure it is our unconquerable resolve, to disillusion our Allies.  To us has fallen the privilege of proving that our mighty sword has been drawn in earnest and that we shall not sheathe it until America’s plighted word is gloriously made good.  \"Make Good!\" Leaping to the tasks which await us on land and sea with that indigenous idiom on their lips, our soldiers and sailors need crave for no more inspiring slogan.  Allied Europe expects us--expects us almost anxiously--to \"make good.\"  London, June 28, 1917.                                   THE ASSAULT                                   CHAPTER I                             THE CURTAIN RAISER   Countess Hannah von Bismarck missed her aim.  The beribboned bottle of \"German champagne\" with which she meant truly well to baptize the newest Hamburg-American leviathan of sixty thousand-odd tons on the placid Saturday afternoon of June 20, 1914, went far wide of its mark.  The Kaiser, impetuous and resourceful, came gallantly and instantaneously to the rescue.  Grabbing the bottle while it still swung unbroken in midair by the black-white-red silken cord which suspended it from the launching pavilion, Imperial William crashed it with accuracy and propelling power a Marathon javelin-thrower might have envied squarely against the vast bow.  The granddaughter of the Iron Chancellor, a bit crestfallen because she had only thrown like any woman exclaimed: \"I christen thee, great ship, _Bismarck_!\" and the milky foam of the _Schaumwein_ trickled in rivulets down the nine- or ten-story side of the most Brobdingnagian product which ever sprang from shipwrights’ hands.  Then, with ten thousand awestruck others gathered there on the Elbe side, I watched the huge steel carcass, released at last from the stocks which had so long held it prisoner, glide and creak majestically down the greasy ways midst our chanting of _Deutschland, Deutschland, über Alles_.  Half a minute later the _Bismarck_ was resting serenely, house-high, on the surface of the murky river five hundred yards away.  The Kaiser and Herr Ballin shook hands feelingly, the royal monarch smiling benignly on the shipping king.  The military band blared forth _Heil Dir im Siegeskranz_, and the last fête Hamburg was destined to know for many a troublous month had passed into history.  Countess von Bismarck had missed her aim!  I wonder if there are not many, like myself, who witnessed the ill-omened launch and who endow it now with a meaning which events of the intervening year have borne out? For, surely, when the Great General Staff at Berlin reviews dispassionately the beginnings of the war, as it some day will do, there will be an absorbingly interesting explanation of how the machine which Moltke, the Organizer of Victory, handed down to an incompetent namesake and nephew missed _its_ aim, too--the winning of the war by a series of short, sharp and staggering blows which should decide the issue in favor of the Germans before the next snow. The argument has been advanced, in vindication of Germany’s innocent intentions, that the Hamburg-American line would never have launched the mighty _Bismarck_ if the Fatherland was planning or contemplating war.  But the ship was not to have made her maiden transatlantic voyage until April 1, 1915, the centenary of her great patronym’s birth.  The German Staff expected to dictate a glorious peace long before that time, and might have done so but for Belgium, Joffre, \"that contemptible little British army,\" and other miscalculations.  If the Staff, like Countess von Bismarck, had not missed its aim, the _Bismarck_ would have poked her gigantic nose into New York harbor on scheduled time, a mammoth symbol of Germany, the World Power indeed, and fitting incarnation of the new Mistress of the Seas.  Who knows but what perhaps grandiose visions of that sort were in the far-seeing Herr Ballin’s card-index mind?  The Kaiser customarily visits the Venice of the North on his way to Kiel Week, the yachting festival invented by him to outrival England’s Cowes, and the launch of the _Bismarck_ was timed accordingly. From Hamburg the Emperor proceeds aboard the Imperial yacht _Hohenzollern_ up the Elbe to Brunsbüttel for the annual regatta of the North German Yacht Squadron, a club consisting for the most part of Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck patricians with the love of the sea inborn in their Hanseatic veins. There was no variation from the time-honored programme in 1914.  William II even adhered to his unfailing practice of delivering an apotheosis of the marine profession at the regatta-dinner of the N.G.Y.S. aboard the Hamburg-American steamer on which Herr Ballin is wont to entertain for Kiel Week a party of two or three hundred German and foreign notables. There was no glimmer of coming events in the guest-list of S."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41252"],["title","The Assault: Germany Before the Outbreak and England in War-Time (#4)"],["body","S. _Victoria Luise_, for it included Mr. John Walter, one of the hereditary proprietors of _The Times_, and several other distinguished Englishmen soon to be Germany’s hated foes.  By that occult agency which determines with diabolical delight the irony of fate, it was ordained that Kiel, 1914, should be the occasion of a spectacular Anglo-German love-feast, with a squadron of British super-dreadnoughts anchored in the midst of the peaceful German Armada as a sign to all the world of the non-explosive warmth of English-German \"relations.\"  That, at any rate, was the design of that unfortunately nebulous element in Berlin, headed by Doctor von Bethmann Hollweg, known as the Peace Party; for had certain highly-placed Germans acting under the Imperial Chancellor’s inspiration had their way, the British Admiralty yacht _Enchantress_, the official craft of the First Lord of the Admiralty and actually bearing that dignitary, Mr. Winston Churchill, M.P., would have been convoyed to Kiel by Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender’s ironclads.  The Kaiser’s approval of the Churchill project--as I happen to know--had been sought and secured.  Eminent friends of an Anglo-German rapprochement in London had done the necessary log-rolling in England. Matters were regarded in Germany so much of a _fait accompli_ that an anchorage diagram issued by the naval authorities at Kiel only a fortnight before the \"Week\" indicated the precise spot at which Mr. Churchill and the _Enchantress_ would make fast in the harbor of Kiel Bay.  [Illustration: Watching for the Kaiser’s Armada.]  But Mr. Churchill did not come.  I know why. Grand-Admiral von Tirpitz, to whom the half-American _enfant terrible_ of British politics was a pet aversion, did not want him at Kiel.  Mr. Churchill’s visit might have resulted in some sort of an Anglo-German naval _modus vivendi_, or otherwise postponed \"the Day.\"  The German War Party’s plans, so soon to materialize, would have been sadly thrown out of gear by such an untimely event, and von Tirpitz is not the man to brook interference with his programmes.  Had not the German Government, under the Grand-Admiral’s invincible leadership, persistently rejected the hand of naval peace stretched out by the British Cabinet?  Was it not Mr. Churchill’s own proposals to which Berlin had repeatedly returned an imperious No?  Could Germany afford to run the risk of being cajoled, amid the festive atmosphere of Kiel Week, into concessions which she had hitherto successively withheld?  Von Tirpitz said No again.  For years he had been saying the same thing on the subject of an armaments understanding with Britain.  He said No to Prince Bülow when the fourth Chancellor suggested the advisability of moderating a German naval policy certain to lead to conflict with Great Britain.  He said No to Doctor von Bethmann Hollweg when Bülow’s successor timorously suggested from time to time, as he did, the foolhardiness of a programme which meant, in an historic phrase of Bülow’s, \"pressure and counter-pressure.\"  Von Tirpitz had had his way with two German Chancellors, his nominal superiors, in succession.  He never dreamt of allowing himself to be bowled over now by an amateur sailor from London, who, if he came to Kiel, would only come armed with a fresh bait designed to rob the Fatherland of its \"future upon the water.\"  Until a bare two weeks before the date of the arrival of the British Squadron in German waters, nothing was publicly known either in London or Berlin of the projected trip of Mr. Churchill to Kiel.  Von Tirpitz thereupon had resort to the weapon he wields almost as dexterously as the submarine--publicity--to depopularize the scheme of the misguided friends of Anglo-German peace.  It was not the first time, of course, that the Grand-Admiral had deliberately crossed the avowed policy of the German Foreign Office.  Von Tirpitz now caused the Churchill-Kiel enterprise to be \"exposed\" in the press, in the confident hope that premature announcement would effectually kill the entire plan.  It did. Tirpitz diplomacy scored again, as it was wont to do.  Whereof I speak in this highly pertinent connection I know, on the authority of one of von Tirpitz’s most subtle and trusted henchmen.  To the latter’s eyes, I hope, these reminiscences may some day come.  He, at least, will know that history, not fiction, is recited here.                                    CHAPTER II                               THE FIRST ACT   \"I am simply in my element here!\" exclaimed the Kaiser ecstatically to Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender, as the twain stood surveying the glittering array of steel-blue German and British men-of-war facing one another amicably on the unruffled bosom of Kiel harbor at high noon of June 25.  From my perch of vantage abaft the forward thirteen-and-one-half-inch guns of His Britannic Majesty’s superdreadnought battleship _King George V_, whither the quartette of London correspondents had been banished during William II’s sojourn in the flagship, I could \"see\" him talking on the quarter-deck below, speaking with those nervous, jerky right-arm gestures which are as important a part of his staccato conversation as uttered words.  The Kaiser was inspecting _his_ flagship, for when he boarded us, almost without notice, in accordance with his irrepressible love of a surprise, Sir George Warrender’s flag came down and the emblem of the German Emperor’s British naval rank, an Admiral of the Fleet, was hoisted atop all the British vessels in the port.  For the nonce the Hohenzollern War Lord was Britannia’s senior in command.  Aboard the four great twenty-three-thousand-ton battleships, _King George V, Audacious, Centurion_ and _Ajax_ and the three fast \"light cruisers\" _Birmingham, Southampton_ and _Nottingham_ there was, for the better part of an hour, no man to say him nay.  I wonder if he, or any of us at Kiel during that amazing week, let our imaginations run riot and conjure up the vision of the _Birmingham_ in action against German warships off Heligoland within ten short weeks, or of the _Audacious_ at the bottom of the Irish Sea, victim of a German mine, five months later?  Warrender’s squadron had come to Kiel two days before.  Another British squadron was at the same moment paying a similar visit of courtesy and friendship to the Russian Navy at Riga.  The English said then, and insist now, that their ships were dispatched to greet the Kaiser and the Czar as sincere messengers of peace and good-will.  The Germans, in the myopic view they have taken of all things since the war began, are convinced that the White Ensign which floated at Kiel six weeks before Great Britain and Germany went to war was the emblem of deceit and hypocrisy, sent there to flap in the Fatherland’s guileless face while Perfidious Albion was crouching for the attack.  They say that to-day, even in presence of the incongruous fact that Serajevo, which applied the match to the European powder-barrel, wrote its red name across history’s page while the British squadron was still riding at anchor in Germany’s war harbor.  It was exactly ten years to the week since British warships had last been to Kiel.  I happened to be there on that occasion, too, when King Edward VII, convoyed by a cruiser squadron, shed the luster of his vivacious presence on the gayest \"Week\" Kiel ever knew.  Meantime the Anglo-German political atmosphere had remained too stubbornly clouded to make an interchange of naval amenities, of all things, either logical or possible.  It was the era in which Germania was preparing her grim battle-toilet for \"the Day\"--for all the world to see, as she, justly enough, always insisted.  They were the years in which her new dreadnought fleet sprang into being.  It was the period in which offer after offer from England for an \"understanding\" on the question of naval armaments met nothing but the cold shoulder in Tirpitz-ruled Berlin. Not until the summer of 1914 had it seemed feasible for British and German warships to mingle in friendly contact.  Doctor von Bethmann Hollweg quite legitimately accounted the arrangement of the Kiel love-feast as an achievement of no mean magnitude, viewed in the light of the ten acrimonious years which preceded it.  The War Party, realizing its harmlessness, and, indeed, recognizing its value for the party’s stealthy purposes, blandly tolerated it.  Even Grand-Admiral von Tirpitz was on hand to do the honors, and no one performs them more suavely than Germany’s fork-bearded sailor-statesman.  The day after Sir George Warrender’s vessels crept majestically out of the Baltic past Friedrichsort, at the mouth of Kiel harbor, to be welcomed by twenty-one German guns from shore batteries, the symptomatic event of the \"Week\" was enacted--the formal opening of the reconstructed Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. I place that day, June 24, not far behind the sanguinary 28th of June, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand fell, in its direct relationship to the outbreak of the war.  When the giant locks of Holtenau swung free, ready henceforth for the passage of William II’s greatest warships, the moment of Germany’s up-to-the-minute preparedness for Armageddon was signalized.  For ten plodding years tens of thousands of hands had been at work converting the waterway which links Baltic Germany with North Sea Germany (Kiel with Wilhelmshaven) into a channel wide and deep enough for navigation by battleships of the largest bulk.  After an expenditure of more than fifty million dollars the canal, dedicated with pomp and ceremony in 1892 to the peaceful requirements of European shipping, was now become a war canal, pure and simple, raised to the war dimension and destined, as the German War Party knew, to play the role for which it was rebuilt almost before its newly-banked stone sides had settled in their foundations.  When I watched proud William II, standing solemn and statue-like on the bridge of his Imperial yacht _Hohenzollern_, as her "]]]
