Knowing that a body of the enemy under Colonel Garfield was advancing to meet him, and that a small force was moving to his rear, he fell back some fifteen miles, and took position on Middle Creek, near Prestonsburg. On January 10, 1862, Garfield attacked him. The firing was kept up, with some intervals, about four hours, and was occasionally very sharp and spirited. Marshall says in his report: \"The enemy did not move me from any one position I assumed, and at nightfall withdrew from the field, leaving me just where I was in the morning. . . . He came to attack, yet came so cautiously that my left wing never fired a shot, and he never came up sufficiently to engage my center or left wing.\" Garfield was said to have fallen back fifteen miles to Paintsville, and Marshall seven miles, where he remained two days, then slowly pursued his retreat. He stated his loss at ten killed and fourteen wounded, and that of the enemy to have been severe.  The battle of Fishing Creek has been the subject of harsh criticism, and I think it will be seen by the report herein inserted that great injustice has been done to General George B. Crittenden, who commanded on that occasion.  In July, 1880, I wrote to him requesting a statement of the affair at Fishing Creek, and a short time before his decease he complied with my request by writing as follows:      \"In November, 1862, I assumed, by assignment, the command of a     portion of East Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky, which embraced     the troops stationed at Mill Springs, on the Cumberland River, and     under the command of General Zollicoffer, who, as I understood the     matter, had been stationed there by General Johnston to prevent the     enemy under Schopf, and confronting him on the opposite side of the     river, from crossing and penetrating into Tennessee. Schopf's camp     was at Somerset, on Fishing Creek, a tributary of the Cumberland,     emptying into it a mile above Mill Springs. He was several miles away     from the bank of the Cumberland, so that both the river and creek     intervened between him and General Zollicoffer. While I was detained     in Knoxville, on business connected with my command, I received an     official communication from General Zollicoffer, informing me that he     had crossed the Cumberland by fording, and was fortifying a camp on     the right bank, etc. By the messenger who bore me this communication     I ordered him to recross the river and resume his original position     on the left bank. Early in January, I reached Mill Springs, and     found, to my surprise. General Zollicoffer still on the right bank.     He called on me immediately, and informed me that his messenger who     bore back my order had lost several days in returning, and that when     it was received he supposed that I would arrive almost immediately;     and, hoping to be able to convince me that it would be better to     remain on the right bank, he had postponed crossing until, by a rise     in the river, it had become impossible to do so; that all his     artillery and a large portion of his wagons were on the right bank,     and his only means of transferring them to the other bank were a     small ferry-boat and a very small stem-wheel steamer, entirely     inadequate to the purpose. I was dissatisfied, but, as I knew that     the General had been actuated by pure motives, I accepted his excuse.     Details were promptly placed in the woods, to prepare timber for     flat-boats to transport the artillery and wagons to the left bank of     the river. The weather was execrable, and the men unskilled, so that     the work progressed slowly.      \"Such was the posture of affairs, when, on the 18th of January, I was     informed that General Thomas was approaching with a large force of     all arms, and would encamp that night within a few miles of us. Here     was thrust upon me the very contingency which my order to General     Zollicoffer was intended to obviate. It rained violently throughout     this day until late in the afternoon. It occurred to me that Fishing     Creek must so rise as to render it impossible for Schopf to connect     with Thomas. Acting upon this idea, I summoned a council of superior     officers, and, laying before them the circumstances of the case,     asked their advice. There was not one of them who did not concur with     me in the opinion that Thomas must be attacked immediately, and, if     possible, by surprise; that such attack, if successful merely in     repulsing him, would probably give us time to cross the Cumberland     with artillery and wagons, by means of our boats, then being built.      \"Accordingly, at twelve o'clock in the night, we marched for the     position of the enemy, ascertained to be some six miles away. We had     scarcely taken up the line of march, when the rain began to fall, the     darkness became intense, and the consequent confusion great, so that     day dawned before we reached his position. The attack, as a surprise,     failed: nevertheless, it was promptly made. It rained violently     throughout the action, rendering all the flint-lock guns useless. The     men bearing them were allowed to fall back on the reserve.      \"The action was progressing successfully, when the fall of General     Zollicoffer was announced to me. Apprehending disastrous     consequences, I hastened to the front. My apprehensions were well     founded. I found the line of battle in confusion and falling back,     and, after a vain effort to restore the line, yielded to necessity,     and, by the interposition of the reserve, covered the shattered line     and effected my retreat to camp without loss.      \"I reached camp late in the afternoon. Not long afterward the enemy     opened fire at long range; night coming on, he ceased to fire. The     few shot and shells that fell in the camp so plainly demonstrated the     demoralization of the men, that I doubted, even if I had had rations,     which I had not, whether the camp could have been successfully     defended for twenty-four hours. There was not, and had not been for     some time in the camp, rations beyond the daily need. This state of     affairs was due to the exhaustion of the neighboring country, and the     impracticability of the roads.      \"It became now my sole object to transfer the men with their arms,     the cavalry-horses, and teams to the left bank of the river. This was     successfully accomplished by dawn of the next day.      \"I attributed the loss of the battle, in a great degree, to the     inferiority of our arms and the untimely fall of General Zollicoffer,     who was known and highly esteemed by the men, who were almost all     Tennesseeans. I think I have shown that the battle of Fishing Creek     was a necessity, and that I ought not to be held responsible for that     necessity. As to how I managed it, I have nothing further to say.\"  General Crittenden's gallantry had been too often and too conspicuously shown in battle during the war with Mexico and on the Indian frontier to admit of question, and the criticism has been directed solely to the propriety of the attack at Fishing Creek. His explanation is conclusive against any arraignment of him for the presence of the troops on the right bank of the Cumberland, or for his not immediately withdrawing them to the left bank when his position was threatened. Under these circumstances, to attack one portion of the enemy, when a junction with the other part could not be effected, was to act in accordance with one of the best-settled rules of war.  The unforeseen accident of renewed rain, with intense darkness, delayed his march beyond reasonable expectation; and, whereas the whole force should have reached the enemy's encampment before dawn, the advance of two regiments only reached there after broad daylight. To hesitate, would have been to give the enemy time for preparation, and I think it was wisely decided to attack at once and rely upon the rear coming up to support the advance; but the rear, encumbered with their artillery, were so far behind that, though the advance were successful in their first encounter, they did not receive the hoped-for support until they had suffered severely, and then the long-known and trusted commander of the forces there, the gallant and most estimable Zollicoffer, fell; whence confusion resulted. General Crittenden had been but a few days with the troops, a disadvantage which will be readily appreciated. Had the whole force been in position at early dawn, so as to have surprised the enemy, the plan would have been executed, and victory would have been the probable result; after which, Schöpf's force might have been readily disposed of. But, had the attack done no more than to check the advance of Thomas until the boats under construction could have been finished, so as to enable Crittenden to save his artillery and equipments, it would have justified the attempt. I therefore think the strategy not only defensible but commendable, and the affair to be ranked with one of the many brilliant conceptions of the war. The reader will not fail to remark the evidence which General Crittenden's report affords of the fallacy of representing the South as having been prepared by supplying herself with the _materiél_ necessary for war. The heart of even a noble enemy must be moved at the spectacle of citizens defending their homes, with muskets of obsolete patterns and shot-guns, against an invader having all the modern improvements in arms. The two regiments constituting the advance were Battle's Twentieth Tennessee and the Fifteenth Mississippi, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Walthall. With dauntless courage they engaged the whole array of the enemy, and drove him from his first position. When at length our forces fell back to their intrenched camp, it was with sullen determination,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],["title","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#0)"],["body","FRANKENSTEIN:                                    OR,                           THE MODERN PROMETHEUS.

LONDON:     HENRY COLBURN AND RICHARD BENTLEY,     NEW BURLINGTON STREET:     BELL AND BRADFUTE, EDINBURGH;     AND CUMMING, DUBLIN.     1831.     INTRODUCTION.   The Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting \"Frankenstein\" for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so very frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.  It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing. As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given me for recreation, was to \"write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of castles in the air--the indulging in waking dreams--the following up trains of thought, which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close imitator--rather doing as others had done, than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for one other eye--my childhood's companion and friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed--my dearest pleasure when free.  I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy. I wrote then--but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself the heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place an affair as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own identity, and I could people the hours with creations far more interesting to me at that age, than my own sensations.  After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction. My husband, however, was from the first, very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of fame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which even on my own part I cared for then, though since I have become infinitely indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I should write, not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy of notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the promise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling, and the cares of a family, occupied my time; and study, in the way of reading, or improving my ideas in communication with his far more cultivated mind, was all of literary employment that engaged my attention.  In the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto of Childe Harold, was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon paper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the light and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of heaven and earth, whose influences we partook with him.  But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from the German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of promise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by the moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.  \"We will each write a ghost story,\" said Lord Byron; and his proposition was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley, more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our language, than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole--what to see I forget--something very shocking and wrong of course; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of Coventry, he did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she was fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished their uncongenial task.  I busied myself _to think of a story_,--a story to rival those which had excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling horror--one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart. If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be unworthy of its name. I thought and pondered--vainly. I felt that blank incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship, when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. _Have you thought of a story?_ I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.  Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and that beginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give the world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself. In all matters of discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the imagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning ideas suggested to it.  Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary motion. Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.  Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by, before we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw--with shut eyes, but acute mental vision,--I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would terrify the artist; he would rush away from his odious handywork, horror-stri"]]]
