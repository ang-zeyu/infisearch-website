Ten to one the Gestapo knows that you are here in London. In fact, it's almost an even money bet that Gestapo agents in London know that you are here in this office right now.\"  \"Gosh!\" Freddy Farmer breathed softly. \"That doesn't give a chap a very pleasant feeling. But go on, sir.\"  \"What I'm working up to is this,\" the Colonel continued. \"If the Gestapo has wind of the Tobolsk business, and I'll bet a year's pay that they have, they are going to be just a bit more excited to learn that you two have been brought into the picture. And it is our plan to bring you into the picture right out in broad daylight, so to speak. In other words, the Air Vice-Marshal here, you two, my agent, and Agent Jones and myself are going to have lunch as Simpson's at the Savoy Hotel this noon. Then we are all coming back here for a short while. Tonight you two will travel to Aberdeen in Scotland. There you will board a bomber that will fly you direct to Moscow. When you reach Moscow the Soviet Intelligence will take over. You will disappear from sight, and you will remain out of sight for a bit. Then at the right time you two and a Russian Intelligence officer, who knows every square inch of the Tobolsk area, will take off by plane and head down the front to the village of Urbakh, which is on the Russian side of the front.\"  The Colonel paused a moment to catch his breath and shift his weight on the chair.  \"Meantime,\" he presently continued, \"Agent Jones will also be making a little journey. You see, we hope that you two will be able to draw the Gestapo away from Jones. He will be sneaked out of England by air, and go to Gibraltar, and on to Alexandria, and up through Iraq, and Iran, and up through the Caucasus to the village of Urbakh. There he will meet your party coming down from Moscow, and--well, from that point on, our plan is only general. You, of course, will have to make your own plans from hour to hour, according to how the situation shapes up. The goal, of course, is for all of you to get over into Tobolsk behind the Nazi lines and contact Ivan Nikolsk, and learn what he has to say, in the event you can't get him out of there by air.\"  \"Zowie!\" Dawson breathed aloud without thinking. \"Just like that, huh? I--Sorry, sir.\"  Colonel Welsh gave a little wave of his hand to signify that Dawson's comment was taken in the right spirit. In fact, he grinned, and nodded his head vigorously.  \"Zowie is right!\" he echoed. \"I'll admit that the assignment appears so screwy, and dizzy, that a man would be a fool even to give a thought to its turning out even partially successfully. But on the other hand, that's something in our favor in a way. It's such a screwy idea that maybe even the Gestapo wouldn't believe we'd try to pull it off. You see, our hope is that they'll think that you're going to Moscow to turn over valuable information to Soviet Intelligence. In short--well, to be very blunt and brutal, it is our hope that the Gestapo will fall all over themselves trying to _stop you two from reaching Moscow_, and in their efforts will forget all about Agent Jones.\"  \"Well, I wish them luck, I don't think!\" Dawson said more cheerfully than he felt. \"At any rate, there should be some fun in beating those murdering bums to the punch. Check, Freddy?\"  \"Quite!\" the English-born air ace managed to get out. \"I've always wanted to visit Moscow, too.\"  \"Well, our prayers will be that you'll have that opportunity,\" Colonel Welsh said almost fervently. \"If you can shake them off at Moscow, even if they suddenly realize they've been very nicely duped, and guess the real truth, we hope there'll not be enough time for them to do anything about it.\"  \"There's one thing I don't quite catch, sir,\" Dawson said after a couple of minutes of general silence. \"The trip over the Nazi front to Tobolsk. There'll be four of us in the party, and, we sincerely hope, five of us coming out. That's quite a crowd to be charging about behind the German lines, to my way of thinking.\"  \"I agree with you in principle,\" the American Intelligence chief replied. \"But this is one of those occasions where we're banking on the idea of safety in numbers. In the first place, there must be someone along who knows that area like the palm of his hand. That's where the Russian Intelligence officer will come in. He'll know the best place to land, and where to hide the aircraft from prying Nazi eyes. Secondly, there has to be the man to contact Nikolsk. That's Agent Jones, of course. Thirdly, or it should be secondly, Nikolsk will have to be found, and that's where the Russian Intelligence officer will come in handy again. He'll be able to hunt around while the rest of you lie doggo and wait. And lastly, there must be a pilot to fly the plane in, and to fly it out again. That's where you two come in. Double insurance, if you get what I mean?\"  \"I get it, sir,\" Dawson said grimly. \"You hope that both Freddy and I will fly in, but there _must_ be one of us left to fly the ship out, eh?\"  \"I mean just that,\" Colonel Welsh said, and there was no smile on his thin face now. \"One of you has _got_ to come back!\"  \"And _both_ of us will!\" Dawson replied instantly.  \"Definitely!\" Freddy Farmer echoed, and seemed content to let it stay like that.  \"Well, that's the picture in more or less detail,\" Colonel Welsh said with a glance at his watch. \"We'll talk over some more of the details again. Right now, though, I guess we've done enough talking. Let's break up this meeting, and think things over. Maybe all of us will have things to add later. That agreeable with you, Air Vice-Marshal?\"  \"Quite,\" the senior R.A.F. officer said with a nod. Then, glancing at Dawson and Farmer, \"All the luck in the world, you chaps. And I need not tell you how I admire you both, and envy you, too, if you must know the truth. I'd give every one of my stripes of rank to be able to go along with you.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Dawson said for them both. Then, with a pointed glance at the decoration ribbons under the tunic wings of the Air Vice-Marshal, he added, \"And we'd like nothing better than to have you along, sir.\"  \"See here, what about me?\" Colonel Welsh snapped with a half grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. \"Am I supposed to be an old woman, or something?\"  \"Just Dawson's nasty manners, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up with a straight face. \"He'll never learn. But I can assure you that his words really included you both.\"  \"And how, sir!\" Dawson exclaimed hastily. \"I figured you'd take that for granted.\"  \"Well, that's a little better!\" Colonel Welsh growled in mock annoyance. \"But you'll never know, Dawson, how close you came to having to pay for that lunch this noon. But of course, I understand, now. So I'll let you off this time, and pay for it myself.\"  Dawson blew air through his lips, and went through the act of wiping beads of sweat from his brow.  \"Boy, did I come close to having to wash a mess of dishes!\" he breathed. \"Because, if the truth must be known, I've got all of three shillings in my pocket!\"  \"As though that were unusual!\" Freddy Farmer shot at him. \"Just name the day when your pay wasn't all spent before you received it.\"  \"Quite!\" the Air Vice-Marshal broke into the conversation. \"But that's a well known R.A.F. habit, of course. Well, Gentlemen, shall we disband, eh, and meet later at Simpson's, what?\"  And nobody put forth any objections.     CHAPTER SEVEN  _You Can't See Death_   Like A black steel snake with a single yellow eye, the \"Flying Scotsman\" went roaring northward over the steel rails that led to Aberdeen. In their compartment, four cars back from the engine, Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer tried to lose their thoughts in the newspapers and magazines they had bought before leaving London. But it was just about as easy to do that as it is for a man to shave with an electric razor in a thunder storm.  However, the two air aces stuck grimly to it for well onto two hours, until finally Freddy reached the end of his string. He flung the magazine across the compartment they shared alone, and heaved a long, loud sigh.  \"This is without question the balmiest war ever!\" he proclaimed with vocal emphasis.  Dawson looked up from his newspaper, nodded, and tossed it to one side.  \"At any rate the screwiest one I ever fought in,\" he said. \"So you haven't been reading either, huh?\"  \"On the contrary, yes,\" Freddy replied. \"But the same blasted paragraph over and over again. I just can't seem to concentrate.\"  Dave glanced at the thick blinds that covered the windows and smiled faintly.  \"I guess nobody could blame you for that, considering,\" he murmured. \"We've been handed some sweet jobs, since we elected to take our own personal swings in this war. And each time has seemed tougher than any of the others. But this--this really is tops for cockeyed assignments. Know something, Freddy?\"  \"What?\"  \"We stand _less_ chance of pulling this thing off than Mussolini stands of being made King of England,\" Dave said.  \"And don't I know it!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"I swear I don't know who's craziest--Leman and Colonel Welsh for putting the proposition up to us, or us for accepting it. Why, good grief, Dave--\"  The English youth seemed unable to continue, so he just left the rest hanging in mid-air, and scowled unseeingly at the single light in the compartment ceiling.  Dave nodded, but didn't speak, because he was thinking the same thoughts as his war pal. And none of them were happy thoughts. True, they would go all out to pull off this miracle that had been dumped in their laps, but he realized in his heart that their chances were thinner than tissue paper. And every click of the coach wheels on the rail breaks added just another exclamation mark to that thought.  To be truthful with himself, he had actually believed that their chances of success were not much less than fifty-fifty. But that had been during the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41718"],["title","Dave Dawson on the Russian Front (#7)"],["body","at Simpson's. There he had met Agent Jones, and Colonel Welsh's agent, who was introduced by the name of Brown. And something about both men had touched a hidden note within him, and filled him with a savage desire to succeed, and the partial belief that all might come off well, at that. During the luncheon no word, of course, had been spoken of the secret double mission about to be undertaken. But when they had all returned to Air Vice-Marshal Leman's office, they had gone into the whole thing in minute detail. At that time Freddy and he had heard both stories of Tobolsk first hand. And though little was added they had not already heard, hearing the stories from the lips of the men who had gone through it all simply made Dave want more than ever to deliver all the valuable information into the right hands. Maybe it was to help repay Jones and Brown for what they had suffered. Or maybe it was because he believed that success might shorten the war considerably. He couldn't make up his mind which idea appealed to him most. He only knew that, when Freddy and he had finally parted company with the others, he wanted to come through with flying colors this time more than he had ever wanted to in his entire war career.  \"Say, Freddy!\" Dave suddenly broke the silence. \"In case I haven't asked it yet, have you seen any Gestapo lads tagging along after us?\"  The English youth shook his head and made a face.  \"Not so much as a tiny peep at one,\" he replied. \"And that gets me to thinking. It would be a very bad joke on us if the blighters saw through our little game, and left you and me strictly alone.\"  \"A bad joke, yes,\" Dawson said with a grin. \"But at least we'd be sure to see Moscow. And that was the big attraction in this to you, wasn't it? Or rather, isn't it?\"  \"Oh, quite!\" Freddy snapped at him. \"Just to see Moscow. _I'm_ really not interested at all in this business about Ivan Nikolsk. But seriously, though, I had a feeling that something might be tried before the train left. But nothing was. Frankly, I'm a little worried.\"  \"Hard-boiled Farmer,\" Dawson grinned. \"Never happy unless he has a fight on his hands. Stop worrying, pal. Something tells me you'll have plenty of chance for action before they ring down the curtain on this job.\"  \"Here's hoping,\" Farmer mumbled. \"But I'm still a little worried. Frankly, I never ask trouble, let alone danger, to come my way. But for once I wish we'd see a bit of it. Such as some beggar coming barging through that compartment door, there, with a gun in his hand.\"  \"What a pretty thought!\" Dawson grunted. \"Do I get it that you've suddenly got tired of living, pal? Or are you just a little more goofy than usual?\"  \"Neither!\" the other told him shortly. \"I simply mean that if something _did_ happen to me, I'd feel a little bit better.\"  \"Why, then, just move your jaw this way, my friend,\" Dave said, and lifted his clenched right fist. \"Always glad to oblige an old, old pal.\"  \"The funniest man on earth, for fair!\" Farmer snorted. \"You'd make millions on the stage--maybe. You nit-wit, don't you get the point?\"  \"What point, Master Mind?\" Dawson shot back at him. \"Do you mean that--Oh, oh, I get it. If something happened to us, that would mean that our unseen Gestapo boys were biting at the bait, huh?\"  \"Splendid!\" Freddy Farmer cried in mock joy. \"I always knew that that brain of yours would come up with the right answer at least once during your life. Quite! That's exactly what I mean. I wish something would happen that was connected with us. It would certainly make me feel better.\"  \"Well, maybe something will after we get off this train,\" Dawson said, and stifled a tiny yawn. \"Maybe our friends don't like to do things on trains. Maybe ... Hey! We're slowing up for a station stop. Wonder what place it is? Let's have a look. Snap off the light, sweetheart.\"  Freddy Farmer whipped up his hand, and the compartment was instantly plunged into pitch darkness. Both boys felt their way over to the window and lifted up the blackout blinds. It took a few seconds to accustom their eyes to the even deeper darkness outside. And then they saw that the train was passing the outskirts of a fair sized town, and obviously slowing down for an eventual full stop.  \"My guess is that it's Edinburgh,\" Freddy Farmer said, with his nose pressed against the glass. \"We've been on this thing long enough to get there, I fancy.\"  \"There and back, I'd say,\" Dawson grunted, and squinted his eyes. \"There! I just saw a sign, but it could say Broadway and Forty-Second Street, for all I could read. Well, so what, anyway? Let's just say it's Edinburgh, and let it go at that. You can't see the end of your nose in this blackout.\"  \"No, wait!\" Freddy Farmer cried out as Dave started to turn away from the window. \"It's not Edinburgh. Just some small place. I guess it must be a signal stop. No, it's definitely not Edinburgh yet.\"  \"Okay, that's what I said,\" Dawson grunted. \"Haul down the blinds, and let's put on the light. In this war, I want all the light I can get, when I can get it.\"  \"Half a moment!\" Freddy called out, with his nose still jammed against the window glass. \"Yes, just as I thought. A signal stop. Two chaps are getting on at the rear. Just saw them now as the train came to a stop. See? And now we're off again!\"  All of which seemed to be quite true. The train had stopped for only the fraction of an instant, just long enough to let two passengers swing quickly aboard. And now it was on its way again, and picking up speed fast. After Freddy had hauled the blackout curtains down into place, and snapped on the light again, Dave chuckled and gave a little shake of his head.  \"Now what's biting you?\" the English-born air ace wanted to know.  \"Nothing special,\" Dawson replied, and stretched out comfortably on the cross-wise seat. \"I was just thinking of how a guy does crazy things when there's something on his mind.\"  \"Meaning me, I suppose?\" Freddy challenged with a dark scowl.  \"Meaning both of us,\" Dave replied. \"Just these last few minutes. The train slowing down, and whether or not it was Edinburgh station. What do we care? We don't. But we act as though the thing were of great importance. See what I mean, pal? When you've got something big on your mind, it's human nature to grab at something small just for a change of scenery, you might say.\"  \"Yes,\" Freddy Farmer said.  And that was all he said, for at that moment the compartment door was rolled back and the conductor came inside, rolling the door shut behind him.  \"Travel vouchers, please, Gentlemen,\" he said, and held out his hand.  Both Freddy and Dave dived hands into their tunic pockets, and came out with their respective travel voucher slips. They handed them over for inspection, and the conductor stared at them long and hard. Finally he lifted his eyes and looked at them each in turn.  \"These aren't in order,\" he said with a gesture of impatience. \"The date stamped on them is too light. I can't read it.\"  Dawson was tempted to tell him that that was simply his tough luck. But he decided that a train tearing through the blackout was no place for wisecracks. And after all, the conductor was only doing his job.  \"They were stamped today, sir,\" he said instead. \"At the Air Ministry. I saw it done myself. So did Captain Farmer. You can take them as being all in order.\"  That last seemed to be the wrong thing to say. The conductor's eyes flashed and he shot a stern look at Dawson.  \"Oh, I can, can I?\" he snapped. \"Very nice of you to tell me, I'm sure. But I have my orders, and I know what they are. All travel vouchers must be in order for people to travel on _my_ train. I'll have to ask you to come along with me and see the Company Inspector, who is in the next to one car back. You can make your explanations to him. And if he says it's all right, then it'll be all right for me.\"  \"And that will be just ducky!\" Dawson growled, and got up off the seat. \"Okay. If it will take a great load off your mind, my friend, then we'll go back and see the Inspector. But on second thought, let's have the Inspector come see us. What do you say, Freddy, huh?\"  \"Oh, come off it, Dave!\" the English youth growled. \"Why make a mountain of it? The chap is just doing his job. So let's go back and straighten it all out with the Inspector. Besides, a bit of a walk wouldn't do either of us any harm.\"  \"For that reason, I agree,\" Dawson grunted, and stepped through the compartment door that the conductor had rolled open.  Leading the way, he headed for the end of the car, and, unlike in the vast majority of English trains, the end door and passageway that permitted travel from car to car. But just as he was stepping into the next car a figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere directly in front of him, and something blunt and hard was jammed against his chest.  \"One sound, and there'll be a dead man under the wheels!\" a voice hissed. \"Stand right where you are!\"  Dave froze stiff, and then was almost knocked off balance as Freddy Farmer came bumping into him from behind. For a split second he half expected to hear the English youth comment volubly on the situation. But he didn't hear a sound. He only felt his pal stiffen, and that was more than enough to tell him that one fake conductor had unquestionably rammed a similar blunt hard object into Freddy's back, and whispered a few words of warning, too.  For a long moment the whole world seemed to stand still for Dave. He knew that he was straining his eyes for a glimpse of the figure blocking his path, but in the bad light he could see nothing but a vague silhouette. Then suddenly he saw the figure's hand reach up and yank hard on the emergency cord. Almost instantly the speed of the train fell off as the engineer up ahead slammed on the brakes. The jolting and jarring lurched Dave forward, but he was prevented from going on his face by the blunt, hard object still digging into his chest.  \"I am going to open the side "]]]
