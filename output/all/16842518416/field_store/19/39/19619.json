A wonderful country, a great place. And you're tickled silly to be here. Okay, I agree with every word you say. God save the King, and there'll always be an England. _Now_, will you let a guy get some sleep?\"  \"But you don't understand what it means to me, Dave.\" Freddy Farmer spoke through the darkness from the other bed. \"This is my native land, my home, and I've--\"  \"Gone completely screwy!\" Dawson snapped. \"Sweet tripe! You were here only two days ago. Two days you've been away, and you're sounding off as though you'd been away for a million years. Just a two day jaunt over to France, and the guy starts flag waving. My pal, much as I like you, you are a pain in seventeen different places at the same time. Go to sleep, you bow-legged Commando!\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson With the Commandos._]  \"Just what I've said quite often,\" Freddy said placidly. \"It takes an Englishman to really appreciate his homeland. Two years or two days, what does it matter? The joy that is his upon arriving back home is always the same. Do you see what I mean, Dave?\"  Dawson groaned, sat up in bed, and switched on the table lamp. But as he did so he took a quick automatic glance at the room windows to make sure that the blackout curtains were drawn and securely fastened. Then he hunched around in bed and glared at his closest and dearest friend in the world.  \"The day will come!\" he snarled. \"So help me, the day will come!\"  The English-born air ace blinked, and looked blank.  \"Eh?\" he echoed. \"What say, Dave?\"  \"Just that the day will come, so help me!\" Dawson answered, and leveled a stiff forefinger. \"The day will come when I'll forget I like you, and will up and bust you right on your snoot. For cat's sake, Freddy! You're worse than a woman, from what I hear of them. Don't you ever shut up?\"  Freddy Farmer propped a hand under his head and grinned.  \"But I don't feel sleepy,\" he said. \"I want to talk. Don't you? Now, really, you're not sleepy, are you, Dave? After all, we haven't had much time to talk since we got back from that Commando show in Occupied France. We've--I say! What's the matter, old fellow?\"  The last was because Dawson's hands had come up in an attitude of prayer, and his lips were moving soundlessly.  \"Just calling for strength,\" he told his pal. \"For a second there I almost wished that you had been left behind, you doggone phonograph record. Look, pal, see these lines on my face? And these pouches under my eyes? Well, that's not from age. Just because I'm tired.\"  Freddy Farmer stared hard, and his face flooded with sympathy. However, there was a very wicked gleam in his eyes.  \"I say, Dave, old thing!\" he murmured. \"I'm frightfully sorry, no end. I thought--well, as you Yanks say, that you could take it. I didn't dream that little Commando show in Occupied France would do you in so much. Put out the light, you poor fellow, and try to get some sleep. Want me to send down to the chemist shop for something to make you sleep? Drugstore, you call it in the States, don't you?\"  Dawson carefully settled himself in a sitting position, and then, clasping his hands in his lap, he started to count.  \"One--two--three--four--five--!\"  \"I say, Dave, what's up?\" Freddy Farmer cried in alarm.  \"When I get to ten, you'll find out!\" Dawson barked. Then, with a heavy sigh, \"Okay, okay, you want to talk, so what chance have I got? I couldn't sleep, now, if I were hit by a truck. But just one thing, Freddy Farmer: keep this night in your memory, always!\"  \"Why, Dave?\"  \"Just never mind, sweetheart!\" Dave grunted. \"Skip it for the present. As you were saying?\"  \"Oh, so you want to talk, old thing?\" the English youth echoed, and grinned maliciously. \"Splendid! It is nice to be back in England, isn't it?\"  \"I could answer that, but my folks brought me up to act like a gentleman!\" Dawson snapped. \"What else, Edison?\"  \"Edison?\"  \"The inventor of the phonograph,\" Dawson said. \"Turn the record and put in a new needle!\"  \"Well, I was wondering--\" the English youth murmured, as he let the wisecrack sail right over his head--\"I was wondering what next, Dave?\"  \"More loss of sleep,\" Dawson flung at him, \"because of more useless talk at three in the morning from a certain nit-wit. And, I do mean you!\"  \"And the same to you, sir!\" Freddy came right back at him, and made a face. \"But I am still wondering what's going to happen next?\"  \"Who cares, so long at it's action against those dirty Nazis,\" Dawson said.  \"Quite!\" the English youth murmured. \"But you're a very tired little fellow. Go on back to sleep. I'll tell you about it in the morning. That'll be time enough. Good night, Dave. Or rather, good morning.\"  Freddy reached a hand toward the table lamp between the twin beds, but Dave grabbed hold of it in time.  \"Nix!\" he said. \"That look on your face makes me suspicious, young fellow. You've got something important on your mind. I can tell. Come on, now. Let's have it, pal.\"  \"Oh, I fancy it will keep until morning,\" Freddy Farmer said with a wicked grin. \"Go get your beauty sleep. After all, it arrived after you had gone to sleep. So what's the difference?\"  By now Dawson was wide awake, and as he swung his legs out from under the covers there was a dangerous glint in his eyes.  \"Stop right there, pal!\" he grunted, and leveled a finger. \"What came after I'd gone to sleep? Do you tell me, or do I toss you through that window, blackout curtains and all?\"  \"Oh no you don't!\" the English youth cried as he leaped out of bed on the far side. \"Calm down, young fellow, and I'll tell you. Stay put, or not a word will I tell you!\"  Dawson relaxed and sank back on his bed.  \"Okay, but it had better be good!\" he growled through a yawn. \"Okay, what's the big mystery?\"  \"It was a phone call,\" Freddy Farmer said with a jerk of his head toward the instrument on the wall. \"From the Air Ministry. We are to report at Room Twelve Hundred at eight o'clock in the morning.\"  \"Hey, they can't do that to us!\" Dave cried. \"We're supposed to be on leave. We--Did the chap at the other end say what it was all about?\"  Freddy Farmer shook his head and slid back into bed.  \"Not a word,\" he said. \"Naturally, I asked questions. But that's all the good it did me. The chap was very brusque. Report at eight, and that's that.\"  Dawson sighed and gave a sad shake of his head.  \"Not that I don't want to do my part in trimming the Nazis,\" he said, \"but, my gosh, I could do with at least a couple of days leave. Why, I haven't even had time to see a movie in months. Oh, well, maybe it's for something unimportant.\"  \"I doubt it,\" Freddy Farmer said emphatically. \"I guess you've forgotten Room Twelve Hundred at the Air Ministry, Dave.\"  \"Huh?\" Dawson echoed, jerking his head up. \"Room--? Holy smoke! That's Royal Air Force Intelligence! But it doesn't make sense, Freddy. We're not in the R.A.F. now. We're with the Yank forces!\"  \"Quite!\" the English-born air ace grunted. \"But I fancy Air Ministry wouldn't have phoned that order if they hadn't first obtained permission of Yank G.H.Q. But what difference does it make, anyway, if it's Yank G.H.Q. or the Air Ministry? Either of them could detail a job to us. But the important thing to me is, what is it this time?\"  \"The fellow on the phone didn't give you any kind of a hint?\" Dawson persisted.  The English youth shook his head.  \"Not the faintest,\" he replied. \"We'll just have to wait and find out, I'm afraid.\"  Dawson groaned and glanced at the clock on the night table. The hands showed him it was exactly sixteen minutes to four. Just four hours and sixteen minutes to wait!  \"Nuts!\" he sighed, and slid down under the covers. \"I wish I hadn't made you tell me, pal. Now there's a fat chance that I'll get any more sleep! You don't happen to have a deck of cards around, do you? We could kill time with some two-handed rummy.\"  \"Sorry,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"Not a card. But I'll sing to you, if you like.\"  \"Never!\" Dawson cried out in mock protest. \"Spare me that, please, sir. Besides, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41718"],["title","Dave Dawson on the Russian Front (#1)"],["body","don't want to have the authorities piling in here to arrest you for impersonating the air raid sirens. Nix! I'll permit you to sing over my dead body. I'll--Oh, darn it! What do you suppose they've got cooked up for us in Room Twelve Hundred at the Air Ministry?\"  \"How I wish I knew!\" Freddy Farmer breathed solemnly. \"But if past experience means anything, there's one thing we can bank on, no doubt.\"  \"Which would be?\" Dawson grunted.  \"A messy job of some kind,\" the English youth opined. \"They seem to save that sort of thing especially for us.\"  \"Check and double check!\" Dawson murmured. \"You've got something there, pal. And how!\"  And with that both boys lapsed into silence, and stared thoughtful and scowlingly up at the hotel room ceiling.     CHAPTER TWO  _Room 1200_   Any period of time will pass if you'll just wait long enough, and so eventually it was eight o'clock in the morning, and the two air aces had paused before Room Twelve Hundred at the Air Ministry. They had paused by unspoken mutual consent. And now as their eyes met they both grinned, and lifted their right hands with the middle fingers crossed over the indexes.  \"Here's for luck, or something,\" Dave Dawson murmured with a wink.  \"Quite,\" Freddy Farmer echoed. \"At least, I hope it won't be _bad_ luck.\"  For a couple of seconds more the two youths hesitated, and then Dave Dawson took a deep breath, turned the door knob, and pushed the door open. He entered the small outer office with Freddy Farmer right at his heels. A Flight Lieutenant seated at the small desk took one swift look at their American Air Force uniforms and recognized them at once.  \"Good morning, Captains,\" he said with a smile. \"I'll tell Air Vice-Marshal Leman, and Colonel Welsh, that you are here.\"  Both Dave and Freddy instantly stiffened and went wide-eyed. It was Dawson who found his tongue first.  \"What's that, Flight Lieutenant?\" he got out. \"Did I hear you say Colonel Welsh? You don't mean Colonel Welsh, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces Intelligence?\"  \"That's exactly who I mean,\" the Flight Lieutenant replied. \"He arrived in England by bomber yesterday. Just a moment, please, and I'll let them know you're here.\"  The Flight Lieutenant went over to a huge solid oak door, knocked on it, and then stepped through and closed it behind him. Dave and Freddy chose that moment to gape puzzle-eyed at each other.  \"Well, what do you know!\" Dawson finally breathed. \"Colonel Welsh, who had us hauled out of the R.A.F. in the first place!\"[2]  [Footnote 2: _Dave Dawson With The Pacific Fleet._]  \"I know,\" the English youth echoed. \"Fancy, meeting him here in London. Well, I guess that certainly means that something new has been cooked up for us. Good grief! His name was the farthest from my mind!\"  \"You and me both!\" Dawson said with a nod. \"And it sure does mean that plenty's on the fire, if Colonel Welsh is over here. But it'll be good to meet him again. He always rated tops with me.\"  \"Quite!\" the English youth murmured.  And that's as far as he got. At that moment the Flight Lieutenant opened the huge solid oak door, and motioned for them to come into the inner office. They did, with Dawson leading the way, and so it was his hand that was grasped first by the thin-faced officer in the uniform of a U.S. Infantry Colonel.  \"Well, Dawson, I'm certainly mighty glad to meet you again!\" the Colonel greeted him. \"And you, too, Farmer. Neither of you has changed a bit.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Dawson smiled back at him. \"And it's good to meet you again. This is certainly one big surprise.\"  \"Quite, sir,\" Freddy echoed as he, too, shook hands with the Colonel. \"I hope you had a nice flight across.\"  \"A perfect hop,\" the senior officer said. \"But I'm forgetting my manners. Air Vice-Marshal Leman, let me present Captains Dawson and Farmer. But perhaps you've already met?\"  The good looking Air Force officer, who had sat smiling behind a desk that seemed to fill half the room, got up instantly and came around it with his hand outstretched.  \"No, but I've certainly heard no end of things about you two,\" he said as he shook hands with both boys. \"But who hasn't, for that matter?\" he continued with a chuckle. \"Including Adolf Hitler, of course. There, have chairs, Gentlemen. I can see it in your faces that you are wondering no end what this is all about. Well, Colonel, I fancy you'd better do the talking for us, eh?\"  The senior American officer smiled, nodded, and then waited until everybody was comfortably seated in chairs.  \"I've a job for you,\" he presently told the two youths bluntly. \"And I want to say right here that it is probably the toughest assignment you ever received. Feel like taking a crack at something _really_ tough?\"  Dave Dawson leaned forward on the edge of his chair, and nodded eagerly. All thoughts of leave were gone from his brain now. Just the sight of Colonel Welsh had changed everything all around. He was more than ever anxious for action.  \"The tougher it is the better I'll like it, sir,\" he said with a grin. \"Speaking for myself, of course.\"  \"Oh, you're jolly well speaking for me, too!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up quickly. \"Besides, you'd have to have me along to watch out for you, you know.\"  Everybody chuckled at that remark, and then Colonel Welsh's thin face became very grave and serious.  \"I really meant that, just the same,\" he said with a grim nod. \"This one is really tough, and your chances of pulling it off successfully are about one in six million, roughly speaking.\"  \"The odds have been pretty big against us in the past, sir,\" Dave said quietly. \"But where are we heading this time, or shouldn't I ask yet?\"  \"You may, and I'll answer it,\" Colonel Welsh replied. \"This time it's Russia.\"  That brought both youths up stiff and straight on the edges of their chairs.  \"Russia?\" Dave gasped out.  \"Russia?\" Freddy Farmer echoed incredulously. \"Good grief!\"  \"That's right, Russia,\" Colonel Welsh repeated. \"But just where in Russia, the good Lord Himself alone knows. To be perfectly frank, it's quite possible that I'm sending you after no more than a handful of Russian air. That's why I say the odds against your success are about one in six million. However, if by any possible chance you do pull this one off, why then--\"  The American Intelligence Chief paused and made a little gesture with his hands.  \"Why then,\" he continued a moment later, \"Civilization will owe you a far bigger debt of gratitude than it does now, even.\"  Neither of the boys said anything. They just sat quietly, with their eyes fixed on the senior officer, and waited for him to continue. However, when the Colonel spoke again it was not to the boys. He addressed himself to Air Vice-Marshal Leman.  \"On second thought, sir,\" he said, \"perhaps you'd better tell your part of it first. Then I'll take it up from there.\"  The senior R.A.F. officer shrugged and nodded.  \"Very well, if you like, Colonel,\" he said. And then, turning to the two air aces, he began, \"This all started back in the summer of 1939, just before Hitler started into Poland. Of course, anybody with half an eye, or half an ear, could have both seen and heard things that would have left no doubt of what the Nazis had up their sleeves. We of Intelligence knew perfectly well that no amount of appeasement would change Hitler's plans one single bit. We knew that the man was no more than a mad dog, and that only a bullet in the brain could stop him. However, the Government in power at the time thought otherwise, and tried to--Well, all that blasted business of the Munich meeting is dead history now. So it doesn't help anything to bring it out into the light again.\"  The R.A.F. Intelligence chief paused for breath and to clear his throat. Then he made a little gesture with one hand and continued.  \"What I'm trying to bring out,\" he said, \"is that though there was hope in certain quarters that something could be done to stop Hitler at that time, and without bloodshed, we of Intelligence were carrying on as though we were actually at war. Or at least on the brink of war, which of course we were. Anyway, our agents were all over Europe gathering every bit of information possible, and making underground contacts that might prove useful when, and if, the guns started firing. Well, one of my agents--and we'll call him Jones for the moment--had a rare bit of luck. It was one of those things that happen say once in a hundred years. It happened as a result of no effort of his part, either. It--well, it was simply a bit of absolutely lucky coincidence.  \"This Jones, having completed a small mission in Prague, in Czechoslovakia, was on his way by train to Krakow, Poland, when right at the borders of Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the train was wrecked. Split rails caused the wreck, and some sixty odd persons were killed. Fortunately, Jones was in one of the three cars that remained on the track, and he received no more than a severe shaking up. Well, it so happened that a Nazi trade mission on the way to Moscow was aboard the train, and two of its members were killed. That, of course, made it more than just an ordinary train wreck. According to Jones the whole place was alive with Nazi officials in no time at all. Actually the exact location of the wreck was a good mile within the Polish borders, but that didn't bother the Nazis any. They regarded it as German ground and took complete charge of everything at once. The Polish officials objected, but that's all the good it did them. Incidentally, the thing did not appear in the public prints, but as a matter of record that wreck was the first of the so-called border incidents that terminated with the Nazi invasion, and slaughter, of Poland.\"  Air Vice-Marshal Leman paused again, and sat staring off into space as though choosing the words he would speak next. And when he did speak again there was just the faintest trace of bitter disappointment in his voice.  \"Whether the wreck was an accident, or was"]]]
