One was democratic with one's chief guard and a little less so with the others. As Halloran drove, Charles chatted with him about the play, which was Julius Caesar in modern dress. Halloran said he'd heard it was very good.         *       *       *       *       *  Their arrival in the lobby of the Costello created no sensation. Five bodyguards wasn't a lot of bodyguards, even though there seemed to be no other Syndic people there. So much for the beautiful Falcaro girl. Charles chatted with a television director he knew slightly. The director explained to him that the theater was sick, very sick, that Harry Tremaine,--he played Brutus--made a magnificent stage picture but couldn't read lines.  By then Halloran was whispering in his ear that it was time to take their seats. Halloran was sweating like a pig and Charles didn't get around to asking him why. Charles took an aisle seat, Halloran was across the aisle and the others sat to his side, front and rear.  The curtain rose on \"New York--A Street.\"  The first scene, a timekiller designed to let fidgeters subside and coughers finish their coughing, was a 3-D projection of Times Square, with a stylized suggestion of a public relations consultant's office \"down in one\" on the apron.  When Caesar entered Orsino started, and there was a gratified murmur around the auditorium. He was made up as French Letour, one of the Mobsters from the old days--technically a hero, but one who had sailed mighty close to the wind. This promised to be interesting.  \"Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.\"  And so to the apron where the soothsayer--public relations consultant--delivered the warning contemptuously ignored by Letour-Caesar, and the spotlight shifted to Cassius and Brutus for their long, foreboding dialogue. Brutus' back was to the audience when it started; he gradually turned--  \"What means this shouting? I do fear the people will choose Caesar for their king!\"  And you saw that Brutus was Falcaro--old Amadeo Falcaro himself, with the beard and hawk nose and eyebrows.  Well, let's see now. It must be some kind of tortured analogy with the Treaty of Las Vegas when Letour made a strong bid to unite Mob and Syndic and Falcaro had fought against anything but a short-term, strictly military alliance. Charles felt kind of sore about Falcaro not getting the title role, but he had to admit that Tremaine played Falcaro as the gutsy magnifico he had been. When Caesar re-entered, the contrast became clear; Caesar-Letour was a fidgety, fear-ridden man. The rest of the conspirators brought on through Act One turned out to be good fellows all, fresh and hearty; Charles guessed everything was all right and he wished he could grab a nap. But Cassius was saying:  \"Him and his worth and our great need of him--\"  All very loyal, Charles thought, smothering a yawn. A life for the Syndic and all that, but a high-brow version. Polite and dignified, like a pavanne at Roseland. Sometimes--after, say, a near miss on the polo field--he would wonder how polite and dignified the great old days actually had been. Amadeo Falcaro's Third Year Purge must have been an affair of blood and guts. Two thousand shot in three days, the history books said, adding hastily that the purged were unreconstructed, unreconstructable thugs whose usefulness was past, who couldn't realize that the job ahead was construction and organization.         *       *       *       *       *  And Halloran was touching Charles on the shoulder. \"Intermission in a second, sir.\"  They marched up the aisle as the curtain fell to applause and the rest of the audience began to rise. Then the impossible happened.  Halloran had gone first; Charles was behind him, with the four other guards hemming him in. As Halloran reached the door to the lobby at the top of the aisle, he turned to face Charles and performed an inexplicable pantomime. It was quite one second before Charles realized that Halloran was tugging at his gun, stuck in the holster.  The guard to the left of Charles softly said: \"Jesus!\" and threw himself at Halloran as the chief guard's gun came loose. There was a .45 caliber roar, muffled. There was another that crashed, unmuffled, a yard from Charles' right ear. The two figures at the head of the aisle collapsed limply and the audience began to shriek. Somebody with a very loud voice roared: \"Keep calm! It's all part of the play! Don't get panicky! It's part of the play!\"  The man who was roaring moved up to the aisle door, fell silent, saw and smelled the blood and fainted.  A woman began to pound the guard on Charles' right with her fists, yelling: \"What did you do to my husband? You shot my husband!\" She meant the man who had fainted; Charles peeled her off the bodyguard.  Somehow they got into the lobby, followed by most of the audience. The three bodyguards held them at bay. Charles found he was deaf in his right ear and supposed it was temporary. Least of his worries. Halloran had taken a shot at him. The guard named Weltfisch had intercepted it. The guard named Donnel had shot Halloran down.  He said to Donnel: \"You know Halloran long?\"  Donnel, not taking his eyes from the crowd, said: \"Couple of years, sir. He was just a guy in the bodyguard pool.\"  \"Get me out of here,\" Orsino said. \"To the Syndic Building.\"  In the big black car, he could almost forget the horror; he could hope that time would erase it completely. It wasn't like polo. That shot had been _aimed_.  The limousine purred to a halt before the titanic bulk of the Syndic Building, was checked and rolled on into the Unrestricted Entrance. An elevator silently lifted the car and passengers past floors devoted to Alcohol Clerical, Alcohol Research, and Testing, Transport, Collections Audit and Control, Cleaning and Dying, Female Recruitment and Retirement, up, up, up, past sections and sub-sections Charles had never entered, Syndic member though he was, to an automatic stop at a floor whose indicator said: _enforcement and public relations_.  It was only 9:45 P.M.; F. W. Taylor would be in and working. Charles said: \"Wait here, boys,\" and muttered the code phrase to the door. It sprang open.  F. W. Taylor was dictating, machine-gun fashion, to a mike. He looked dog-tired. His face turned up with a frown as Charles entered and then the frown became a beam of pleasure.  \"Charles, my boy! Sit down!\" He snapped off the machine.  \"Uncle--\" Charles began.  \"It was so kind of you to drop in. I thought you'd be at the theater.\"  \"I was, Uncle, but--\"  \"I'm working on a revision for the next edition of _Organization, Symbolism and Morale_. You'd never guess who inspired it.\"  \"I'm sure I wouldn't, Uncle. Uncle--\"  \"Old Thornberry, President of the Chase National. He had the infernal gall to refuse a line of credit to young McGurn. _Bankers!_ You won't believe it, but people used to _beg_ them to take over their property, tie up their incomes, virtually enslave them. People _demanded_ it. The same way they demanded inexpensive liquor, tobacco and consumer goods, clean women and a chance to win a fortune and our ancestors obliged them. Our ancestors were sneered at in their day, you know. They were called criminals when they distributed goods and services at a price people could afford to pay.\"  \"Uncle!\"  \"Hush, boy, I know what you're going to say. You can't fool the people forever! When they'd had enough hounding and restriction, they rose in their might.  \"The people demanded freedom of choice, Falcaro and the rest rose to lead them in the Syndic and the Mob and they drove the Government into the sea.\"  \"Uncle Frank--\"  \"From which it still occasionally ventures to annoy our coastal cities,\" F. W. Taylor commented. He warmed to his subject. \"You should have seen the old boy blubber. The last of the old-time bankers, and they deserved everything they got. They brought it on themselves. They had what they called laissez-faire, and it worked for awhile until they got to tinkering with it. They demanded things called protective tariffs, tax remissions, subsidies--regulation, regulation, regulation, always of the other fellow. But there were enough bankers on all sides for everybody to be somebody else's other fellow. Coercion snowballed and the Government lost public acceptance. They had a thing called the public debt which I can't begin to explain to you except to say that it was something written on paper and that it raised the cost of everything tremendously. Well, believe me or not, they _didn't_ just throw away the piece of paper or scratch out the writing on it. They let it ride until ordinary people couldn't afford the pleasant things in life.\"  \"Uncle--\"         *       *       *       *       *  A cautious periscope broke the choppy water off Sea Island, Georgia. At the other end of the periscope were Captain Van Dellen of the North American Navy, lean as a hound, and fat little Commander Grinnel.  \"You might take her in a little closer, Van,\" said Grinnel mildly.  \"The exercise won't do you any lasting damage,\" Van Dellen said. Grinnel was very, very, near to a couple of admirals and normally Van Dellen gave him the kid-glove treatment in spite of ranking him. But this was _his_ ship and no cloak and dagger artist from an O.N.I. desk was telling him how to con it.  Grinnel smiled genially at the little joke. \"I could call it a disguise,\" he said patting his paunch, \"but you know me too well.\"  \"You'll have no trouble with a sea like this,\" Van Dellen said, strictly business. He tried to think of some appropriate phrase to recognize the danger Grinnel was plunging into with no resources except quick wits, a trick ring and a pair of guns. But all that bubbled up to the top of his head was; thank God I'm getting rid of this bastardly little Sociocrat. He'll kill me some day if he gets a clean shot and the chance of detection is zero. Thank God I'm a Constitutionist. We don't go in for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41714"],["title","The Syndic (#3)"],["body","like that--or do we? Nobody ever tells me anything. A hack of a pigboat driver. And this little bastard's going to be an admiral some day. But that boy of mine'll be an admiral. He's brainy, like his mother.  Grinnel smiled and said: \"Well, this would be it, wouldn't it?\"  \"Eh?\" Van Dellen asked. \"Oh. I see what you mean. Chuck!\" he called a sailor. \"Break out the Commander's capsules. Pass the word to stand by for ejection.\"  The Commander was fitted, puffing, into the capsule. He growled at the storekeeper: \"You sure this was just unsealed? It feels sticky already.\"  A brash jayee said: \"I saw it unsealed myself three minutes ago, Commander. It'll get stickier if we spend any more time talking. You have\"--he glanced at his chronometer--\"seventeen minutes now. Let me snap you in.\"  The Commander huddled down after a searching glance at the jayee's face which photographed it forever in his memory. The top snapped down. Some day--some happy day--that squirt would very much regret telling him off. He gave an okay sign to Van Dellen who waved back meagerly and managed a smile. Three crewmen fitted the capsule into its lock.  Foomf!  It was through the hatch and bobbing on the surface. Its color matched the water's automatically. Grinnel waggled the lever that aimed it inshore and began to turn the propellor crank. He turned fast; the capsule--rudders, crank, flywheel, shaft and all--would dissolve in approximately fifteen minutes. It was his job to be ashore when that happened.  And ashore he'd be practically a free agent with the loosest sort of roving commission, until January 15th. Then his orders became most specific.     III   Charles Orsino squirmed in the chair. \"Uncle--\" he pleaded.  \"Yes,\" F. W. Taylor chuckled, \"Old Amadeo and his colleagues were called criminals. They were called bootleggers when they got liquor to people without worrying about the public debt or excise taxes. They were called smugglers when they sold cheap butter in the south and cheap margerine in the north. They were called counterfeiters when they sold cheap cigarettes and transportation tickets. They were called high-jackers when they wrested goods from the normal inflation-ridden chain of middlemen and delivered them at a reasonable price to the consumers.  \"They were criminals. Bankers were pillars of society.  \"Yet these bankers who dominated society, who were considered the voice of eternal truth when they spoke, who thought it was insanity to challenge their beliefs, started somewhere and perhaps they were the best thing for their day and age that could be worked out....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Father Ambrosius gnawed at a bit of salt herring, wiped his hands, dug through the litter in his chest and found a goose quill and a page of parchment. He scrubbed vigorously with a vinegar-soaked sponge, at the writing on the parchment and was pleased to see that it came off nicely, leaving him a clean surface to scribble his sermon notes on. He cut the quill and slit it while waiting for the parchment to dry, wondering idly what he had erased. (It happened to be the last surviving copy of Tacitus' _Annals_, VII. i-v.)  To work then. The sermon was to be preached on Sexagesima Sunday, a prelude to the solemn season of Lent. Father Ambrosius' mind wandered in search of a text. Lent ... salt herring ... penitence ... the capital sins ... avarice ... usury ... delinquent pew rent ... fat-headed young Sir Baldwin in his tumbledown castle on the hill ... salt herring now and _per saeculae saeculorum_ unless Sir Baldwin paid up his delinquent pew rent.  At the moment, Sir Baldwin came swaggering into the cell. Father Ambrosius rose courteously and said, with some insincerity: \"_Pax vobiscum._\"  \"Eh?\" asked Sir Baldwin, his silly blue eyes popping as he looked over his shoulder. \"Oh, you meant me, padre. It don't do a bit of good to chatter at me in Latin, you know. The king's Norman is what I speak. I mean to say, if it's good enough for his majesty Richard, it's good enough for me, what? Now, what can I do for you, padre?\"  Father Ambrosius reminded him faintly: \"You came to see me, Sir Baldwin.\"  \"Eh? Oh. So I did. I was huntin' stag, padre, and I lost him after chasin' the whole morning, and what I want to know is, who's the right saint chap to ask for help in a pickle like that? I mean to say, I wanted to show the chaps some good sport and we started this beast and he got clean away. Don't misunderstand me, padre, they were good chaps and they didn't rot me about it, but that kind of talk gets about and doesn't do one a bit of good, what? So you tell me like a good fellow who's the right saint chap to put the matter in the best light for me?\"  Father Ambrosius repressed an urge to grind his teeth, took thought and said: \"St. Hubert, I believe, is interested in the stag hunt.\"  \"Right-oh, padre! St. Hubert it is. Hubert, Hubert. I shan't forget it because I've a cousin named Hubert. Haven't seen him for years, poor old chap. He had the fistula--lived on slops and couldn't sit his horse for a day's huntin'. Poor old chap. Well, I'm off--no, there's another thing I wanted. Suppose this Sunday you preach a howlin' strong sermon against usury, what? That chap in the village, the goldsmith fellow, has the infernal gall to tell me I've got to give him Fallowfield! Forty acres, and he has the infernal gall to tell me they aren't mine any more. Be a good chap, padre, and sort of glare at him from the pulpit a few times to show him who you mean, what?\"  \"Usury _is_ a sin,\" Father Ambrosius said cautiously, \"but how does Fallowfield enter into it?\"  Sir Baldwin twiddled the drooping ends of his limp, blond mustache with a trace of embarrassment. \"Fact is, I told the chap when I borrowed the twenty marks that Fallowfield would stand as security. I ask you, padre, is it my fault that my tenants are a pack of lazy, thieving Saxon swine and I couldn't raise the money?\"  The parish priest bristled unnoticeably. He was pure Saxon himself. \"I shall do what I can,\" he said. \"And Sir Baldwin, before you go--\"  The young man stopped in the doorway and turned.  \"Before you go, may I ask when we'll see your pew rent, to say nothing of the tithe?\"  Sir Baldwin dismissed it with an airish wave of the hand. \"I thought I just told you, padre. I haven't a farthing to my name and here's this chap in the village telling me to clear out of Fallowfield that I got from my father and his father before him. So how the devil--excuse me--can I pay rent and tithes and Peters pence and all the other things you priest chaps expect from a man, what?\" He held up his gauntleted hand as Father Ambrosius started to speak. \"No, padre, not another word about it. I know you'd love to tell me I won't go to heaven if I act this way. I don't doubt you're learned and all that, but I can still tell you a thing or two, what? The fact is, I _will_ go to Heaven. You see, padre, God's a gentleman and he wouldn't bar another gentleman over a trifle of money trouble that could happen to any gentleman, now would he?\"  The fatuous beam was more than Father Ambrosius could bear; his eyes fell.  \"Right-oh,\" Sir Baldwin chirped. \"And that saint chap's name was St. Hubert. I didn't forget, see? Not quite the fool some people think I am.\" And he was gone, whistling a recheat.  Father Ambrosius sat down again and glared at the parchment. Preach a sermon on usury for that popinjay. Well, usury _was_ a sin. Christians were supposed to lend to one another in need and not count the cost or the days. But who had ever heard of Sir Baldwin ever lending anything? Of course, he was lord of the manor and protected you against invasion, but there didn't seem to be any invasions anymore....  Wearily, the parish priest dipped his pen and scratched on the parchment: RON. XIII ii, viii, XV i. \"Whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God ... owe no man any thing ... we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak....\" A triple-plated text, which, reinforced by a brow of thunder from the pulpit should make the village goldsmith think twice before pressing his demand on Sir Baldwin. Usury _was_ a sin.  There was a different knock on the door frame.  The goldsmith, a leather-aproned fellow named John, stood there twisting his cap in his big, burn scarred hands.  \"Yes, my son? Come in.\" But he scowled at the fellow involuntarily. He should know better than to succumb to the capital sin of avarice. \"Well, what is it?\"  \"Father,\" the fellow said, \"I've come to give you this.\" He passed a soft leather purse to the priest. It clinked.  Father Ambrosius emptied it on his desk and stirred the broad silver coins wonderingly with his finger. Five marks and eleven silver pennies. No more salt herring until Lent! Silver forwarded to his bishop in an amount that would do credit to the parish! A gilding job for the image of the Blessed Virgin! Perhaps glass panes in one or two of the church windows!  And then he stiffened and swept the money back into the purse. \"You got this by sin,\" he said flatly. \"The sin of avarice worked in your heart and you practiced the sin of usury on your fellow Christians. Don't give this money to the Church; give it back to your victims.\"  \"Father,\" the fellow said, nearly blubbering, \"excuse me but you don't understand! They come to me and come to me. They say it's all right with them, that they're hiring the money the way you'd hire a horse. Doesn't that make sense? Do you think I _wanted_ to become a moneylender? No! I was an honest goldsmith and an honest goldsmith can't help himself. All the money in the village drifts somehow into his hands. One leaves a mark with you for safekeeping and pays you a penny the year to guard it. Another brings you silver coins to make into a basin, and you get to keep whatever coins are left over. And then others come to you and say 'Let me have soandso's mark to use for a year and then I'll pay it back and with it "]]]
