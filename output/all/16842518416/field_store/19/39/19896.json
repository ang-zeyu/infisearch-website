One after another they peered, new ones glided imperceptibly into sight as though to say, We see too.  The mountains were not before them but a little to the right of their path, until new ones appeared ahead of them like giants arising from sleep, and then their path seemed blocked as though by a mighty wall against which its feeble wanderings went in vain. In the end it turned a bit to its right and went straight for a dark mountain, where a wild track seemed to come down out of the rocks to meet it, and upon this track looked down that sinister house. Had you been there, my reader, you would have said, any of us had said, Why not choose some other house? There were no other houses. He who dwelt on the edge of the ravine that ran into that dark mountain was wholly without neighbours.  And evening came, and still they were far from the mountain.  The sun set on their left. But it was in the eastern sky that the greater splendour was; for the low rays streaming across lit up some stormy clouds that were brooding behind the mountain and turned their gloomy forms to an astounding purple.  And after this their road began to rise toward the ridges. The mountains darkened and the sinister house was about to merge with their shadows, when he who dwelt there lit candles.  The act astonished the wayfarers. All through half the day they had seen the house, until it seemed part of the mountains; evil it seemed like their ridges, that were black and bleak and forbidding, and strange it seemed with a strangeness that moved no fears they could name, yet it seemed inactive as night.  Now lights appeared showing that someone moved. Window after window showed to the bare dark mountain its gleaming yellow glare; there in the night the house forsook the dark rocks that seemed kin to it, by glowing as they could never glow, by doing what the beasts that haunted them could not do: this was the lair of man. Here was the light of flame but the rocks remained dark and cold as the wind of night that went over them, he who dwelt now with the lights had forsaken the rocks, his neighbours.  And, when all were lit, one light high in a tower shone green. These lights appearing out of the mountain thus seemed to speak to Rodriguez and to tell him nothing. And Morano wondered, as he seldom troubled to do.  They pushed on up the steepening path.  \"Like you the looks of it?\" said Rodriguez once.  \"Aye, master,\" answered Morano, \"so there be straw.\"  \"You see nothing strange there, then?\" Rodriguez said.  \"Master,\" Morano said, \"there be saints for all requirements.\"  Any fears he had felt about that house before, now as he neared it were gone; it was time to put away fears and face the event; thus worked Morano's philosophy. And he turned his thoughts to the achievements upon earth of a certain Saint who met Satan, and showed to the sovereign of Hell a discourtesy alien to the ways of the Church.  It was dark now, and the yellow lights got larger as they drew nearer the windows, till they saw large shadows obscurely passing from room to room. The ascent was steep now and the pathway stopped. No track of any kind approached the house. It stood on a precipice-edge as though one of the rocks of the mountain: they climbed over rocks to reach it. The windows flickered and blinked at them.  Nothing invited them there in the look of that house, but they were now in such a forbidding waste that shelter had to be found; they were all among edges of rock as black as the night and hard as the material of which Cosmos was formed, at first upon Chaos' brink. The sound of their climbing ran noisily up the mountain but no sound came from the house: only the shadows moved more swiftly across a room, passed into other rooms and came hurrying back. Sometimes the shadows stayed and seemed to peer; and when the travellers stood and watched to see what they were they would disappear and there were no shadows at all, and the rooms were filled instead with their wondering speculation. Then they pushed on over rocks that seemed never trodden by man, so sharp were they and slanting, all piled together: it seemed the last waste, to which all shapeless rocks had been thrown.  Morano and these black rocks seemed shaped by a different scheme; indeed the rocks had never been shaped at all, they were just raw pieces of Chaos. Morano climbed over their edges with moans and discomfort. Rodriguez heard him behind him and knew by his moans when he came to the top of each sharp rock.  The rocks became savager, huger, even more sharp and more angular. They were there in the dark in multitudes. Over these Rodriguez staggered, and Morano clambered and tumbled; and so they came, breathing hard, to the lonely house.  In the wall that their hands had reached there was no door, so they felt along it till they came to the corner, and beyond the corner was the front wall of the house. In it was the front door. But so nearly did this door open upon the abyss that the bats that fled from their coming, from where they hung above the door of oak, had little more to do than fall from their crannies, slanting ever so slightly, to find themselves safe from man in the velvet darkness, that lay between cliffs so lonely they were almost strangers to Echo. And here they floated upon errands far from our knowledge; while the travellers coming along the rocky ledge between destruction and shelter, knocked on the oaken door.  The sound of their knocking boomed huge and slow through the house as though they had struck the door of the very mountain. And no one came. And then Rodriguez saw dimly in the darkness the great handle of a bell, carved like a dragon running down the wall: he pulled it and a cry of pain arose from the basement of the house.  Even Morano wondered. It was like a terrible spirit in distress. It was long before Rodriguez dare touch the handle again. Could it have been the bell? He felt the iron handle and the iron chain that went up from it. How could it have been the bell! The bell had not sounded: he had not pulled hard enough: that scream was fortuitous. The night on that rocky ledge had jangled his nerves. He pulled again and more firmly. The answering scream was more terrible. Rodriguez could doubt no longer, as he sprang back from the bell-handle, that with the chain he had pulled he inflicted some unknown agony.  The scream had awakened slow steps that now came towards the travellers, down corridors, as it sounded, of stone. And then chains fell on stone and the door of oak was opened by some one older than what man hopes to come to, with small, peaked lips as those of some woodland thing.  \"Se隳res,\" the old one said, \"the Professor welcomes you.\"  They stood and stared at his age, and Morano blurted uncouthly what both of them felt. \"You are old, grandfather,\" he said.  \"Ah, Se隳res,\" the old man sighed, \"the Professor does not allow me to be young. I have been here years and years but he never allowed it. I have served him well but it is still the same. I say to him, 'Master, I have served you long ...' but he interrupts me for he will have none of youth. Young servants go among the villages, he says. And so, and so...\"  \"You do not think your master can give you youth!\" said Rodriguez.  The old man knew that he had talked too much, voicing that grievance again of which even the rocks were weary. \"Yes,\" he said briefly, and bowed and led the way into the house. In one of the corridors running out of the hall down which he was leading silently, Rodriguez overtook that old man and questioned him to his face.  \"Who is this professor?\" he said.  By the light of a torch that spluttered in an iron clamp on the wall Rodriguez questioned him with these words, and Morano with his wondering, wistful eyes. The old man halted and turned half round, and lifted his head and answered. \"In the University of Saragossa,\" he said with pride, \"he holds the Chair of Magic.\"  Even the names of Oxford or Cambridge, Harvard or Yale or Princeton, move some respect, and even yet in these unlearned days. What wonder then that the name of Saragossa heard on that lonely mountain awoke in Rodriguez some emotion of reverence and even awed Morano. As for the Chair of Magic, it was of all the royal endowments of that illustrious University the most honoured and dreaded.  \"At Saragossa!\" Rodriguez muttered.  \"At Saragossa,\" the old man affirmed.  Between that ancient citadel of learning and this most savage mountain appeared a gulf scarce to be bridged by thought.  \"The Professor rests in his mountain,\" the old man said, \"because of a conjunction of the stars unfavourable to study, and his class have gone to their homes for many weeks.\" He bowed again and led on along that corridor of dismal stone. The others followed, and still as Rodriguez went that famous name Saragossa echoed within his mind.  And then they came to a door set deep in the stone, and their guide opened it and they went in; and there was the Professor in a mystical hat and a robe of dim purple, seated with his back to them at a table, studying the ways of the stars. \"Welcome, Don Rodriguez,\" said the Professor before he turned round; and then he rose, and with small steps backwards and sideways and many bows, he displayed all those formulae of politeness that Saragossa knew in the golden age and which her professors loved to execute. In later years they became more elaborate still, and afterwards were lost.  Rodriguez replied rather by instinct than knowledge; he came of a house whose bows had never missed graceful ease and which had in some generations been a joy to the Court of Spain. Morano followed behind him; but his servile presence intruded upon that elaborate ceremony, and the Professor held up his hand, and Morano was held in mid stride as though the air had gripped him. There he stood motionless, having never felt magic before. And when the Professor had welcomed Rodriguez in a manner worthy of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42901"],["title","Creatures of the Abyss (#0)"],["body","of the Abyss                        By Murray Leinster      [Transcriber Note: Extensive research did not uncover any evidence     that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       A BERKLEY MEDALLION BOOK     published by     THE BERKLEY PUBLISHING CORPORATION      COPYRIGHT ｩ 1961, BY MURRAY LEINSTER      _Published by arrangement with     the author_      BERKLEY EDITION, AUGUST, 1961      _BERKLEY MEDALLION BOOKS are published by     Berkley Publishing Corporation     101 Fifth Avenue, New York 3, N. Y._      Printed in the United States of America     _One_   The moment arrived when Terry Holt realized that he was simply holding the bag for Jimenez y C禘.--Jimenez and Company--in the city of Manila. He wasn't getting anywhere, himself. So, painfully, he prepared to wind up the company's affairs and his own, and start over. It seemed appropriate to take inventory, consult the police--they'd been both amiable and co-operative--and then make new plans. But first it would be a good idea to go somewhere else for a while, until the problem presented by _La Rubia_ and radar and fish and _orejas de ellos_ had been settled. He was at work on the inventory when the door opened, the warning-bell tinkled, and the girl came into the shop.  He looked up with a wary eye, glancing over the partition separating the workshop area in which the merchandise sold by Jimenez y C禘. was assembled. There were certain people he felt should not come into the shop. The police agreed with him. He was prepared to throw out anybody who came either to demand that he build something or else, or to demand that he not build it or else. In such forcible ejections he would be backed by the authorities of the city and the Philippine Republic.  But this customer was a girl. She was a pretty girl. She was pleasantly tanned. Her make-up, if she wore any, looked natural, and she carried a sizable parcel under her arm. She turned to close the door behind her. She was definitely from the United States. So Terry said in English, \"Good afternoon. Can I do something for you?\"  She looked relieved.  \"Ah! We can talk English,\" she said gratefully. \"I was afraid I'd have trouble. I do have trouble with Spanish.\"  Terry came out from behind the partition marking off the workshop. The shop was seventeen feet wide and its larger expanse of plate glass said, \"_Jimenez y C禘._\" in large letters. Terry's now-vanished partner Jimenez had liked to see his name in large print. Under the name was the line \"_Especialidades Electr撑icas y F𥧄icas._\" This was Terry's angle. He assembled specialties in the line of electronics and modern physics. Jimenez had sold them, not wisely but too well. At the bottom corner of the window there was a modest statement: \"_Orejas de Ellos_,\" which meant nothing to anybody but certain commercial fishermen, all of whom would deny it.  The girl looked dubiously about her. The front of the shop displayed two glaringly white electric washing machines, four electric refrigerators, and two deep-freeze cabinets.  \"But I'm not sure this is the right shop,\" she said. \"I'm not looking for iceboxes.\"  \"They're window-dressing,\" said Terry. \"My former business associate tried to run an appliance shop. But the people who buy such things in Manila only want the latest models. He got stuck with these from last year. So we do--I did do--_especialidades electr撑icas y f𥧄icas_. But I'm shutting up shop. What are you looking for?\"  The shop was in an appropriate place for its former products. Outside on the Calle Enero there were places where one could buy sea food in quantity, mother-of-pearl, pitch, coir rope, b鹹he-de-mer, copra, fuel oil, Diesel repair-parts and edible birds' nests. _Especialidades_ fitted in. But though it was certainly respectable enough, this neighborhood wasn't exactly where one would have expected to find a girl like this shopping for what a girl like this would shop for.  \"I'm looking,\" she explained, \"for somebody to make up a special device, probably electronic, for my father's boat.\"  \"Ah!\" said Terry regretfully. \"That's my line exactly, as is evidenced in Spanish on the window and in Tagalog, Malay and Chinese on cards you can read through the glass. But I'm suspending operations for a while. What kind of special device? Radar--No. I doubt you'd want _orejas de ellos_....\"  \"What are they?\"  \"Submarine ears,\" said Terry. \"For fishing boats. The name is no clue at all. They pick up underwater sounds, enabling one to hear surf a long way off. Which may be useful. And some fish make noises and the fishermen use these ears to eavesdrop on them and catch them. You wouldn't be interested in anything of that sort!\"  The girl brightened visibly.  \"But I am! Something very much like it, at any rate. Take a look at this and see what my father wants to have made.\"  She put her parcel on a deep-freeze unit and pulled off its paper covering. The object inside was a sort of curved paddle with a handle at one end. It was about three feet long, made of a light-colored fibrous wood, and on the convex part of its curvature it was deeply carved in peculiar transverse ridges.  \"A fish-driving paddle,\" she explained. \"From Alua.\"  He looked it over. He knew vaguely that Alua was an island somewhere near Bohol.  \"Naturally a fish-driving paddle is used to drive fish,\" she said. \"To--herd them, you might say. People go out in shallow water and form a line. Then they whack paddles like these on the surface of the water. Fish try to get away from the sound and the people herd them where they want them--into fish-traps, usually. I've tried this, while wearing a bathing suit. It makes your skin tingle--smart, rather. It's a sort of pins-and-needles sensation. Fish would swim away from an underwater noise like that!\"  Terry examined the carving.  \"Well?\"  \"Of course we think there's something special about the noise these paddles make. Maybe a special wave-form?\"  \"Possibly,\" he admitted. \"But--\"  \"We want something else to do the same trick on a bigger scale. Directional, if possible. Not a paddle, of course. Better. Bigger. Stronger. Continuous. We want to drive fish and this paddle's limited in its effect.\"  \"Why drive fish?\" asked Terry.  \"Why not?\" asked the girl. She watched his face.  He frowned a little, considering the problem the girl posed.  \"Oh, _ellos_ might object,\" he said absently.  \"Who?\"  \"_Ellos_,\" he repeated. \"It's a superstition. The word means 'they' or 'them.' Things under the ocean who listen to the fish and the fishermen.\"  \"You're not serious.\" It was a statement.  \"No,\" he admitted, still eying the paddle. \"But the modern, businesslike fishermen who buy submarine ears for sound business reasons call them _orejas de ellos_ and everybody knows what they mean, even in the modernized fishing fleet.\"  \"Which,\" said the girl, \"Jimenez y C禘. has had a big hand in modernizing. That's why I came to you. Your name is Terry Holt, I think. An American Navy Captain said you could make what my father wants.\"  Terry nodded suddenly to himself.  \"What you want,\" he said abruptly, \"might be done with a tape-recorder, a submarine ear, and an underwater horn. You'd make a tape-recording of what these whackings sound like under water, edit the tape to make the whackings practically continuous, and then play the tape through an underwater horn to reproduce the sounds at will. That should do the trick.\"  \"Good! How soon can you do it?\" she asked.  \"I'm afraid not at all,\" said Terry. \"I find I've been a little too efficient in updating the fishing fleet. I'm leaving the city for the city's good.\"  She looked at him inquiringly.  \"No,\" he assured her. \"The police haven't asked me to leave. They're glad I'm going, but they're cordial enough and it's agreed that I'll come back when somebody else finds out how _La Rubia_ catches her fish.\"  \"_La Rubia?_\"  \"_The Redhead_,\" he told her. \"It's the name of a fishing boat. She's found some place where fish practically fight to get into her nets. For months, now, she's come back from every trip loaded down gunwale-deep. And she makes her trips fast! Naturally the other fishermen want to get in on the party.\"  \"So?\"  \"The bonanza voyages,\" Terry explained, \"started immediately after _La Rubia_ had submarine ears installed. Immediately all the other boats installed them. My former partner sold them faster than I could assemble them. And nobody regrets them. They do increase the catches. But they don't match _La Rubia_. She's making a mint of money! She's found some place or she has some trick that loads her down deep every time she puts out to sea.\"  The girl made an interrogative sound.  \"The other fishermen think it's a place,\" Terry added, \"so they ganged up on her. Two months back, when she sailed, the entire fishing fleet trailed her. They stuck to her closer than brothers. So she sailed around for a solid week and never put a net overboard. Then she came back to Manila--empty. They were furious. The price of fish had gone sky-high in their absence. They went to sea to make some money regardless. When they got back they found _La Rubia_ had sailed after they left, got back before they returned--and she was just loaded with fish, and the market was back to normal. There was bad feeling. There were fights. Some fishermen landed in the hospital and some in jail.\"  A motor truck rolled by on the street outside the shop of the now moribund Jimenez y C禘. The girl automatically turned her eyes to the source of the noise. Then she looked back at Terry.  \"And then my erstwhile associate Jimenez had a brainstorm,\" said Terry ruefully. \"He sold the skipper of _La Rubia_ on the idea of short-range radar. I built a set for him. It was good for possibly twenty miles. So _La Rubia_ sailed in the dark of the moon with fifty fishing boats swearing violent oaths that they'd follow her to hell-and-gone. When night fell _La Rubia_ put out her lights, used her radar to locate the other boats who"]]]
