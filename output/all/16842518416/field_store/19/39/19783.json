EDITED BY  H.W. BATES,  ASSISTANT-SECRETARY OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.     AN AUSTRALIAN SEARCH PARTY--I.  BY CHARLES H. EDEN.   IN a former narrative, published in the preceding volume of the ILLUSTRATED TRAVELS, I gave an account of a terrible cyclone which visited the north-eastern coast of Queensland in the autumn of 1866, nearly destroying the small settlements of Cardwell and Townsville, and doing an infinity of damage by uprooting heavy timber, blocking up the bush roads, etc.  Amongst other calamities attendant on this visitation was the loss of a small coasting schooner, named the 'Eva', bound from Cleveland to Rockingham Bay, with cargo and passengers.  Only those who have visited Australia can picture to themselves the full horror of a captivity amongst the degraded blacks with whom this unexplored district abounds; and a report of white men having been seen amongst the wild tribes in the neighbourhood of the Herbert River induced the inhabitants of Cardwell to institute a search party to rescue the crew of the unhappy schooner, should they still be alive; or to gain some certain clue to their fate, should they have perished.  In my former narrative I described our exploration of the Herbert River, lying at the south end of Rockingham Channel, with its fruitless issue; and I now take up the thread of my story from that point, thinking it can hardly fail to be of interest to the reader, not only as regards the wild nature of the country traversed, but also as showing the anxiety manifested by the inhabitants of these remote districts to clear up the fate of their unhappy brethren.  I may also here mention, for the information of such of my readers as may not have read the preceding portions of the narrative, that Cardwell is the name of a small township situated on the shores of Rockingham Bay; and that Townsville is a settlement some hundred miles further south, known also as Cleveland Bay.   HOW WE EXPLORED GOULD AND GARDEN ISLANDS.  We were all much pleased at a piece of intelligence brought up by the 'Daylight', to the effect that a party of volunteers had been assembled at Cleveland Bay, and intended coming up in a small steamer to the south end of Hinchinbrook, to assist in the search for the missing crew.  As it would be of the utmost importance that both parties should co-operate, I sent my boat down to the mouth of the channel, with a note to the leader of the expedition announcing our intention of landing on the north end of the island and working towards the centre; and requesting them to scour their end, and then push northward, when we should most probably meet in the middle of the island.  The boat had orders to wait at the bar until the arrival of the steamer, and then to return with all speed.  In the meanwhile, the 'Daylight' was discharging her cargo, and we were making preparations for what we well knew would prove a most arduous undertaking; the sequel will show that we did not overrate the difficulties before us.  At the risk of being tedious, I must explain to the reader some of the peculiarities of Hinchinbrook Island.  Its length is a little short of forty miles, and its shape a rude triangle, the apex of which is at the south, and the north side forming the southern portion of Rockingham Bay. Now this north side is by no means straight, but is curved out into two or three bays of considerable extent, and in one of them stand two islands named Gould and Garden Islands.  The latter of these was our favourite resort for picnics, for the dense foliage afforded good shade, and, when the tide was low, we were enabled to gather most delicious oysters from some detached rocks.  Gould Island is considerably larger; but, rising in a pyramid from the sea, and being covered with loose boulders, it was most tedious climbing.  From the township we could, with our glasses, see canoes constantly passing and repassing between these two islands; and as the 'Daylight' had a particularly heavy cargo this trip, and would not be clear for the next two days, we made up our minds to search the islands, and drive the blacks on to Hinchinbrook, so that one of our parties must stumble across them when we swept it.  This may seem to the reader unnecessary trouble, but most of our party were conversant with the habits of the blacks and their limited method of reasoning; and we judged it probable that the Herbert River gins would have at once acquainted the Hinchinbrook blacks with our unceremonious visit, and warned them that we should probably soon look them up also.  Now on the receipt of this unwelcome intelligence, the first thing that would strike the blacks would be the facilities for concealment afforded by Gould or Garden Islands, more particularly had they any captives; and they would say to themselves that we should certainly overlook these two out-of-the-way little spots; and when we were busy on Hinchinbrook, they could easily paddle themselves and their prisoners to some of the more distant chain of islands, where they could lie by until all fear of pursuit was past. Such was the opinion both of the troopers and of the experienced bushmen; and as we were fully resolved to leave them no loophole for escape, we jumped into our boat and pulled gently over to Garden Island.  It was about seven o'clock in the morning when we started, six strong--four whites, and Cato, and Ferdinand--well armed, and with a good supply of provisions.  The sun was already very hot, and the water smooth as glass, save where the prow of the boat broke the still surface into a tiny ripple, which continued plainly visible half a mile astern.  I find it difficult to bring before the reader the thousand curious objects that met us on our way.  The sullen crocodile basking in the sun, sank noiselessly; a splash would be heard, and a four feet albicore would fling himself madly into the air, striving vainly to elude the ominous black triangle that cut the water like a knife close in his rear.  Small chance for the poor fugitive, with the ravenous shark following silent and inexorable.  We lay on our oars and watched the result.  The hunted fish doubles, springs aloft, and dives down, but all in vain; the black fin is not to be thrown off, double as he may.  Anon the springs become more feeble, the pursuer's tail partly appears as he pushes forward with redoubled vigour, a faint splash is heard, the waters curl into an eddy, and the monster sinks noiselessly to enjoy his breakfast in the cooler depths beneath.  And now we come to a sand bank running out some miles or so into the bay, and on which the water is less than three fathoms.  Here the surface is broken by huge black objects, coming clumsily to the top, shooting out a jet of spray, and again disappearing.  We let the boat glide gently along until she rests motionless above the bank, and stooping over the side with our faces close to the water, and sheltered by our hands, we can peer down into the placid depths, and see the huge animals grazing on the submarine vegetation with which their favourite feeding-place is thickly overgrown. But what animal is he talking about? the reader will ask.  It is the dugong ('Halicore Australis'), or sea-cow, from whence is extracted an oil equal to the cod-liver as regards its medicinal qualities, and far superior to it in one great essential, for instead of a nauseous disagreeable flavour, it tastes quite pleasantly.  It frequents the whole of the north-eastern coast of Australia, and when the qualities of the oil first became known, it was eagerly sought after by invalids who could not overcome their repugnance to the cod-liver nastiness.  The fishermen, however, spoilt their own market, for greed induced them to adulterate the new medicine with shark oil, and all kinds of other abominations, so that the faculty were never quite certain what they were pouring down the throats of their unhappy patients. Thus the oil lost its good name, though I am convinced from personal observation that fresh, pure dugong is quite equal, if not superior, in nourishing qualities to cod-liver oil, and do not doubt that a time will come when it will enter largely into the Pharmacopoeia.  The animal itself is so peculiar, that a brief description of it may not be here amiss.  Its favourite haunts are bays into which streams empty themselves, and where the water is from two to five fathoms in depth, feeding on the 'Algae' of the submerged banks, for which purpose the upper lip is very large, thick, and as it turns down suddenly at right angles with the head, it much resembles an elephant's trunk shorn off at the mouth.  Its length averages from eight to fourteen feet; there is no dorsal fin, and the tail is horizontal; colour blue, and white beneath.  Its means of propulsion are two paddles, with which it also crawls along the bottom, and beneath which are situated the udders, with teats exactly like a cow's. Its flesh is far from bad, resembling lean beef in appearance, though hardly so good to the taste, and the skin can be manufactured into gelatine.  I have often wondered that this most useful animal was not oftener captured.  A fishing establishment with a good boat, a trained crew, and proper appliances for extracting the oil, could not fail to return a large profit to the proprietors, and every now and then they could kill a whale, one or more of which could be frequently seen disporting themselves in the waters of the bay.  [Illustration--BAY ON HINCHINBROOK ISLAND, WITH NATIVES.]  By ten o'clock we had reached Garden Island, and beached the boat on a long sandy spit that stretched into the sea.  Leaving one man as boat-keeper, we spread ourselves into line, and regularly beat the little island from end to end, but without finding a single black; we could, however, see their smoke-signals arising from Gould"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4237"],["title","Australian Search Party (#1)"],["body","land, and observed several heavily-laden canoes making the best of their way towards Hinchinbrook.  Our search having been unsuccessful, we hurried down to the boat, with the intention of cutting the fugitives off, but found to our disgust that the tide had fallen so low during our absence that our united strength was insufficient to move the boat, so we were perforce compelled to remain until the return of the water.  This did not in reality so much signify, indeed, some of the party were rather averse to our plan of intercepting the canoes, arguing that if closely pressed, the blacks might make an end of their captives. However this might be, there was no help for it, we were stuck fast until the afternoon, so had to summon such philosophy as we possessed, and while away the time as best we could.  The boat's sail, spread under the shade of a tree, kept the intense heat a little at bay until after dinner, and this most essential part of the day's programme have been done ample justice to, and the pipes lighted and smoked out, we wandered about the long space left bare by the tide, amusing ourselves by collecting oysters, cowrie shells, and periwinkles.  The way we captured the two latter was by turning over the rocks, to the under sides of which we found them adhering in great numbers, sticking on like snails to a garden wall.  Some of the cowries were very beautiful, particularly those of a deep brown colour approaching to black.  This kind, however, were rather rare, and the lucky finder of a large one excited some envy.  These beautiful little shells are of all sizes, from half an inch to two inches in length.  When the stone is first turned over, the fish is almost out of its home, and the bright colour of the shell is hidden by a fleshy integument, but a few seconds suffice for it to withdraw within doors, and then the mottled pattern is seen in its full beauty.  The best way to get the shell without injury to its gloss, is to keep the fish alive in a bucket of salt water, until you reach home, and then to dig a hole a couple of feet deep, and bury them.  In a month or so, they may be taken up, and will be found quite clean, free from smell, and as bright in hue as during life.  I have tried boiling them, heaping them in the sun, and various other methods, but this is undoubtedly the best.  [Illustration--SATIN BOWER-BIRDS]  Should it ever fall to the lot of any of my readers to have to cook periwinkles--and there are many worse things, when you are certain of their freshness--let them remember that they should be boiled in 'salt water'.  This is to give them toughness; if fresh water is used, however expert the operator may be with his pin, he will fail to extract more than a moiety of the curly delicacy.  These little facts, though extraneous to our subject, are always worth knowing.  At one end of Garden Island, and distant from it about 200 yards, stands a very singular rock, of a whitish hue, and when struck at a certain angle by the sun, so much resembling the canvas of a vessel, that it was named the \"Sail Rock.\"  At low tide this could be reached by wading, the water being little more than knee-deep.  Its base was literally covered with oysters of the finest quality.  The mere task of getting there was one of considerable difficulty, for the rock was as slippery as glass, and whenever you got a fall--which happened on an average every five minutes--bleeding hands and jagged knees bore testimony to a couch of growing bivalves being anything but as soft as a feather bed; also the oysters cling so fast that they might be taken for component parts of the rock, and only a cold chisel and mallet will induce them to relinquish their firm embrace.  Three or four of the party had ventured out, and we had secured a large sackful, after which we all retired to the tent, except one of our number, who, having a lady-love in Cardwell with an inordinate affection for shell-fish, lingered to fill a haversack for his 'inamorata'.  We were comfortably smoking our pipes and watching with satisfaction the tide rising higher and higher, when a faint \"coo-eh\" from the direction of the rock reached us, followed by another and another and another, each one more shrill than the last.  \"By Jove, Wordsworth's in some trouble!\" exclaimed one of our party, and, snatching up our carbines, we hurried to the end of the island at which stood the Sail Rock.  The tide had now risen considerably, and the water between the rock and ourselves was over four feet deep, and increasing in depth each moment.  We saw poor Wordsworth clinging on to the slippery wall, as high up as the smooth mass afforded hand-hold.  \"Come along, old fellow!\" we shouted; \"it's not up to your neck yet.\"  \"He turned his head over his shoulder--even at the distance we were, its pallor was quite visible--and slowly and cautiously releasing one hand, he pointed to the water between himself and the island.  \"By Jove!\" cried the pilot, \"he's bailed up by a shark, look at his sprit-sail!\" and following his finger we saw an enormous black fin sailing gently to and fro, as regularly and methodically as a veteran sentry paces the limits of his post.  \"Stick tight, old man! we'll bring the boat,\" and leaving the pilot to keep up a fusillade at the monster with the carbines, we darted back. I shall never forget the efforts we made to launch the boat, but she was immovable, and every moment the tide was rising, the little ripples expending themselves in bubbly foam against the thirsty sand.  We strained, we tugged, we prised with levers, but unavailingly, the boat seemed as if she had taken root there and would not budge an inch.  A happy thought struck me all of a sudden, as a reminiscence of a similar case that I had seen in years gone by came back in full vigour.  \"Give me a tomahawk,\" I said.  One was produced in a minute from under the stern-sheets.  Meanwhile I had got out a couple of the oars.  \"Now, Jim, you're the best axeman, off with them here!\"  Half a dozen strokes to each, and the blades were severed from the looms.  \"Now boys, lay aft and lift her stern.\"  It was done, and one of the oars placed under as a roller.  \"Now, launch together.\"  \"Heave with a will.\"  \"She's moving!\"  \"Again so.  Keep her going.\"  \"Hurrah!\" and a loud cheer broke forth, as, through the medium of the friendly rollers, the heavy boat trundled into the water.  The pull was long, at least it seemed to us long, for we had to round the sandy spit before we could head towards the rock, and nearly got on shore in trying to make too close a shave.  We could hear the crack of the pilot's carbine every few minutes, borne down to us by the freshening breeze, and the agonising \"coo-ehs\" of poor Wordsworth, whose ankles were already hidden by the advancing waters; added to this, we had only two oars, and the wind, now pretty strong, was dead in our teeth.  I was steering, and Jim was standing up in the bows with his carbine for a shot, if the shark offered such an opportunity.  As we neared the rock we could distinctly see the black fin within six feet of the narrow ledge on which the poor fellow was standing, and only when we approached to within a couple of boats' lengths, did the ferocious brute sail sullenly out to sea, pursued by a harmless bullet from Jim's rifle.  Poor Wordsworth dropped into the boat fainting from terror, exhaustion, and loss of blood, for, although he was unconscious of it all the time, in his convulsive grip, the sharp oyster-shells had cut his hands to the very bone.  A good glass of grog and some hot tea--the bushman's infallible remedy--soon brought him round, but the scars on his hands and knees will accompany him to his grave.  He afterwards described the glances that the shark threw at him as perfectly diabolical, and confessed that he it not been for the cheery hails of the pilot, he should most certainly have relinquished his hold, and met with a death too horrible to contemplate.  It was now about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the boat being launched, we resolved to reach Gould Island before dark.  The tent was soon struck, the provisions stowed away, the priming of the carbines looked to afresh, and in a few minutes we were sweeping across the small belt of water that separated the two islands.  We approached the shore with caution, for, as I mentioned before, the sides of Gould Island are everywhere very steep, and hostile blacks, by simply dislodging some of the loose masses of rock, could easily have smashed the boat and its crew to pieces without exposing themselves to the slightest danger.  Noiselessly, and with every faculty painfully alert, we closed the land, sprang on to the rocks, and at once set about the tedious task of breasting the hill. Hill climbing, under the vertical sun of North Australia, is by no means an enjoyable undertaking, more particularly when the loose shale and rock gives way at every stride, bringing down an avalanche of rubbish on the heads of the rearmost of the party.  Encumbered with our carbines, we made but slow progress, and it was nearly six o'clock before we attained the summit, from whence we saw several canoes making their way with full speed towards Hinchinbrook.  \"So far then, so good,\" we said; \"we have made certain that none of the rascals are lurking about the two islands, and we are sure to get them now, when we sweep Hinchinbrook.\"  We had now done everything that was possible until the 'Daylight' had finished unloading, and so spread ourselves out about the island to see if the blacks had left any of their curious implements behind them.  We were in no hurry to get back to the township, so purposed having supper where we were, and pulling back in the cool of the evening, by the light of the moon, which was just then in full glory.  We found plenty of traces of the blacks, the embers of their fires even still glowing, but they had carried off everything with them, and no trophies crowned our search"]]]
