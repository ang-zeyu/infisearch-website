And betaking me to the loneliness of mine own room, I fell to thinking of this most courteous lady, thinking of whom I was overtaken by a pleasant slumber, wherein a marvellous vision was presented to me: for there appeared to be in my room a mist of the colour of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed therewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking he said many things, among the which I could understand but few; and of these, this: _Ego dominus tuus._[10] In his arms it seemed to me that a person was sleeping, covered only with a blood-coloured cloth; upon whom looking very attentively, I knew that it was the lady of the salutation who had deigned the day before to salute me. And he who held her held also in his hand a thing that was burning in flames; and he said to me, _Vide cor tuum_.[11] But when he had remained with me a little while, I thought that he set himself to awaken her that slept; after the which he made her to eat that thing which flamed in his hand; and she ate as one fearing. Then, having waited again a space, all his joy was turned into most bitter weeping; and as he wept he gathered the lady into his arms, and it seemed to me that he went with her up towards heaven: whereby such a great anguish came upon me that my light slumber could not endure through it, but was suddenly broken. And immediately having considered, I knew that the hour wherein this vision had been made manifest to me was the fourth hour (which is to say, the first of the nine last hours) of the night.    [10] “I am thy master.”    [11] “Behold thy heart.”  Then, musing on what I had seen, I proposed to relate the same to many poets who were famous in that day: and for that I had myself in some sort the art of discoursing with rhyme, I resolved on making a sonnet, in the which, having saluted all such as are subject unto Love, and entreated them to expound my vision, I should write unto them those things which I had seen in my sleep. And the sonnet I made was this:—      To every heart which the sweet pain doth move,       And unto which these words may now be brought       For true interpretation and kind thought,     Be greeting in our Lord’s name, which is Love.     Of those long hours wherein the stars, above,       Wake and keep watch, the third was almost nought,       When Love was shown me with such terrors fraught     As may not carelessly be spoken of.     He seemed like one who is full of joy, and had       My heart within his hand, and on his arm         My lady, with a mantle round her, slept;     Whom (having wakened her) anon he made       To eat that heart; she ate, as fearing harm.         Then he went out; and as he went, he wept.  _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first part I give greeting, and ask an answer; in the second, I signify what thing has to be answered to. The second part commences here: “Of those long hours.”_  To this sonnet I received many answers, conveying many different opinions; of the which one was sent by him whom I now call the first among my friends, and it began thus, “Unto my thinking thou beheld’st all worth.”[12] And indeed, it was when he learned that I was he who had sent those rhymes to him, that our friendship commenced. But the true meaning of that vision was not then perceived by any one, though it be now evident to the least skilful.    [12] The friend of whom Dante here speaks was Guido Cavalcanti.  From that night forth, the natural functions of my body began to be vexed and impeded, for I was given up wholly to thinking of this most gracious creature: whereby in short space I became so weak and so reduced that it was irksome to many of my friends to look upon me; while others, being moved by spite, went about to discover what it was my wish should be concealed. Wherefore I (perceiving the drift of their unkindly questions), by Love’s will, who directed me according to the counsels of reason, told them how it was Love himself who had thus dealt with me: and I said so, because the thing was so plainly to be discerned in my countenance that there was no longer any means of concealing it. But when they went on to ask, “And by whose help hath Love done this?” I looked in their faces smiling, and spake no word in return.  Now it fell on a day, that this most gracious creature was sitting where words were to be heard of the Queen of Glory;[13] and I was in a place whence mine eyes could behold their beatitude: and betwixt her and me, in a direct line, there sat another lady of a pleasant favour; who looked round at me many times, marvelling at my continued gaze which seemed to have _her_ for its object. And many perceived that she thus looked; so that departing thence, I heard it whispered after me, “Look you to what a pass _such a lady_ hath brought him;” and in saying this they named her who had been midway between the most gentle Beatrice and mine eyes. Therefore I was reassured, and knew that for that day my secret had not become manifest. Then immediately it came into my mind that I might make use of this lady as a screen to the truth: and so well did I play my part that the most of those who had hitherto watched and wondered at me, now imagined they had found me out. By her means I kept my secret concealed till some years were gone over; and for my better security, I even made divers rhymes in her honour; whereof I shall here write only as much as concerneth the most gentle Beatrice, which is but a very little. Moreover, about the same time while this lady was a screen for so much love on my part, I took the resolution to set down the name of this most gracious creature accompanied with many other women’s names, and especially with hers whom I spake of. And to this end I put together the names of sixty of the most beautiful ladies in that city where God had placed mine own lady; and these names I introduced in an epistle in the form of a _sirvent_, which it is not my intention to transcribe here. Neither should I have said anything of this matter, did I not wish to take note of a certain strange thing, to wit: that having written the list, I found my lady’s name would not stand otherwise than ninth in order among the names of these ladies.    [13] _i.e._, in a church.  Now it so chanced with her by whose means I had thus long time concealed my desire, that it behoved her to leave the city I speak of, and to journey afar: wherefore I, being sorely perplexed at the loss of so excellent a defence, had more trouble than even I could before have supposed. And thinking that if I spoke not somewhat mournfully of her departure, my former counterfeiting would be the more quickly perceived, I determined that I would make a grievous sonnet[14] thereof; the which I will write here, because it hath certain words in it whereof my lady was the immediate cause, as will be plain to him that understands.    [14] It will be observed that this poem is not what we now call a        sonnet. Its structure, however, is analogous to that of the        sonnet, being two sextetts followed by two quatrains, instead        of two quatrains followed by two triplets. Dante applies the        term sonnet to both these forms of composition, and to no        other.  And the sonnet was this:—      All ye that pass along Love’s trodden way,     Pause ye awhile and say       If there be any grief like unto mine:     I pray you that you hearken a short space     Patiently, if my case       Be not a piteous marvel and a sign.      Love (never, certes, for my worthless part,     But of his own great heart,)       Vouchsafed to me a life so calm and sweet     That oft I heard folk question as I went     What such great gladness meant:—       They spoke of it behind me in the street.      But now that fearless bearing is all gone       Which with Love’s hoarded wealth was given me;       Till I am grown to be     So poor that I have dread to think thereon.     And thus it is that I, being like as one       Who is ashamed and hides his poverty,       Without seem full of glee,     And let my heart within travail and moan.  _This poem has two principal parts; for, in the first, I mean to call the Faithful of Love in those words of Jeremias the Prophet_, “O vos omnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte si est dolor sicut dolor meus,” _and to pray them to stay and hear me. In the second I tell where Love had placed me, with a meaning other than that which the last part of the poem shows, and I say what I have lost. The second part begins here, “Love, (never, certes).”_  A certain while after the departure of that lady, it pleased the Master of the Angels to call into His glory a damsel, young and of a gentle presence, who had been very lovely in the city I speak of: and I saw her body lying without its soul among many ladies, who held a pitiful weeping. Whereupon, remembering that I had seen her in the company of excellent Beatrice, I could not hinder myself from a few tears; and weeping, I conceived to say somewhat of her death, in guerdon of having seen her somewhile with my lady; which thing I spake of in the latter end of the verses that I writ in this matter, as he will discern who understands. And I wrote two sonnets, which are these:—   I.      Weep, Lovers, sith Love’s very self doth weep,       And sith the cause for weeping is so great;       When now so many dames, of such estate     In worth, show with their eyes a grief so deep:     For Death the churl has laid his leaden sleep       Upon a damsel who was fair of late,       Defacing all our earth should celebrate,—     Yea all save virtue, which the soul doth keep.     Now hearken how much Love did honour her.       I myself saw him in his proper form         Bending above the motionless"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],["title","The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#3)"],["body","dead,     And often gazing into Heaven; for there       The soul now sits which when her life was warm         Dwelt with the joyful beauty that is fled.  _This first sonnet is divided into three parts. In the first, I call and beseech the Faithful of Love to weep; and I say that their Lord weeps, and that they, hearing the reason why he weeps, shall be more minded to listen to me. In the second, I relate this reason. In the third, I speak of honour done by Love to this Lady. The second part begins here, “When now so many dames;” the third here, “Now hearken.”_   II.      Death, alway cruel, Pity’s foe in chief,     Mother who brought forth grief,       Merciless judgment and without appeal!       Since thou alone hast made my heart to feel       This sadness and unweal,     My tongue upbraideth thee without relief.      And now (for I must rid thy name of ruth)     Behoves me speak the truth       Touching thy cruelty and wickedness:       Not that they be not known; but ne’ertheless       I would give hate more stress     With them that feed on love in very sooth.      Out of this world thou hast driven courtesy,       And virtue, dearly prized in womanhood;       And out of youth’s gay mood     The lovely lightness is quite gone through thee.      Whom now I mourn, no man shall learn from me       Save by the measure of these praises given.       Whoso deserves not Heaven     May never hope to have her company.[15]    [15] The commentators assert that the last two lines here do not        allude to the dead lady, but to Beatrice. This would make        the poem very clumsy in construction; yet there must be some        covert allusion to Beatrice, as Dante himself intimates. The        only form in which I can trace it consists in the implied        assertion that such person as _had_ enjoyed the dead lady’s        society was worthy of heaven, and that person was Beatrice.        Or indeed the allusion to Beatrice might be in the first poem,        where he says that Love “_in forma vera_” (that is, Beatrice),        mourned over the corpse: as he afterwards says of Beatrice,        “_Quella ha nome Amor_.” Most probably _both_ allusions are        intended.  _This poem is divided into four parts. In the first I address Death by certain proper names of hers. In the second, speaking to her, I tell the reason why I am moved to denounce her. In the third, I rail against her. In the fourth, I turn to speak to a person undefined, although defined in my own conception. The second part commences here, “Since thou alone;” the third here, “And now (for I must);” the fourth here, “Whoso deserves not.”_  Some days after the death of this lady, I had occasion to leave the city I speak of, and to go thitherwards where she abode who had formerly been my protection; albeit the end of my journey reached not altogether so far. And notwithstanding that I was visibly in the company of many, the journey was so irksome that I had scarcely sighing enough to ease my heart’s heaviness; seeing that as I went, I left my beatitude behind me. Wherefore it came to pass that he who ruled me by virtue of my most gentle lady was made visible to my mind, in the light habit of a traveller, coarsely fashioned. He appeared to me troubled, and looked always on the ground; saving only that sometimes his eyes were turned towards a river which was clear and rapid, and which flowed along the path I was taking. And then I thought that Love called me and said to me these words: “I come from that lady who was so long thy surety; for the matter of whose return, I know that it may not be. Wherefore I have taken that heart which I made thee leave with her, and do bear it unto another lady, who, as she was, shall be thy surety;” (and when he named her I knew her well). “And of these words I have spoken, if thou shouldst speak any again, let it be in such sort as that none shall perceive thereby that thy love was feigned for her, which thou must now feign for another.” And when he had spoken thus, all my imagining was gone suddenly, for it seemed to me that Love became a part of myself: so that, changed as it were in mine aspect, I rode on full of thought the whole of that day, and with heavy sighing. And the day being over, I wrote this sonnet:—      A day agone, as I rode sullenly       Upon a certain path that liked me not,       I met Love midway while the air was hot,     Clothed lightly as a wayfarer might be.     And for the cheer he showed, he seemed to me       As one who hath lost lordship he had got;       Advancing tow’rds me full of sorrowful thought,     Bowing his forehead so that none should see.     Then as I went, he called me by my name,       Saying: “I journey since the morn was dim         Thence where I made thy heart to be: which now     I needs must bear unto another dame.”       Wherewith so much passed into me of him         That he was gone, and I discerned not how.  _This sonnet has three parts. In the first part, I tell how I met Love, and of his aspect. In the second, I tell what he said to me, although not in full, through the fear I had of discovering my secret. In the third, I say how he disappeared. The second part commences here, “Then as I went;” the third here, “Wherewith so much.”_  On my return, I set myself to seek out that lady whom my master had named to me while I journeyed sighing. And because I would be brief, I will now narrate that in a short while I made her my surety, in such sort that the matter was spoken of by many in terms scarcely courteous; through the which I had oftenwhiles many troublesome hours. And by this it happened (to wit: by this false and evil rumour which seemed to misfame me of vice) that she who was the destroyer of all evil and the queen of all good, coming where I was, denied me her most sweet salutation, in the which alone was my blessedness.  And here it is fitting for me to depart a little from this present matter, that it may be rightly understood of what surpassing virtue her salutation was to me. To the which end I say that when she appeared in any place, it seemed to me, by the hope of her excellent salutation, that there was no man mine enemy any longer; and such warmth of charity came upon me that most certainly in that moment I would have pardoned whosoever had done me an injury; and if one should then have questioned me concerning any matter, I could only have said unto him “Love,” with a countenance clothed in humbleness. And what time she made ready to salute me, the spirit of Love, destroying all other perceptions, thrust forth the feeble spirits of my eyes, saying, “Do homage unto your mistress,” and putting itself in their place to obey: so that he who would, might then have beheld Love, beholding the lids of mine eyes shake. And when this most gentle lady gave her salutation, Love, so far from being a medium beclouding mine intolerable beatitude, then bred in me such an overpowering sweetness that my body, being all subjected thereto, remained many times helpless and passive. Whereby it is made manifest that in her salutation alone was there any beatitude for me, which then very often went beyond my endurance.  And now, resuming my discourse, I will go on to relate that when, for the first time, this beatitude was denied me, I became possessed with such grief that, parting myself from others, I went into a lonely place to bathe the ground with most bitter tears: and when, by this heat of weeping, I was somewhat relieved, I betook myself to my chamber, where I could lament unheard. And there, having prayed to the Lady of all Mercies, and having said also, “O Love, aid thou thy servant,” I went suddenly asleep like a beaten sobbing child. And in my sleep, towards the middle of it, I seemed to see in the room, seated at my side, a youth in very white raiment, who kept his eyes fixed on me in deep thought. And when he had gazed some time, I thought that he sighed and called to me in these words: “_Fili mi, tempus est ut prætermittantur simulata nostra._”[16] And thereupon I seemed to know him; for the voice was the same wherewith he had spoken at other times in my sleep. Then looking at him, I perceived that he was weeping piteously, and that he seemed to be waiting for me to speak. Wherefore, taking heart, I began thus: “Why weepest thou, Master of all honour?” And he made answer to me: “_Ego tanquam centrum circuli, cui simili modo se habent circumferentiæ partes: tu autem non sic._”[17] And thinking upon his words, they seemed to me obscure; so that again compelling myself unto speech, I asked of him: “What thing is this, Master, that thou hast spoken thus darkly?” To the which he made answer in the vulgar tongue: “Demand no more than may be useful to thee.” Whereupon I began to discourse with him concerning her salutation which she had denied me; and when I had questioned him of the cause, he said these words: “Our Beatrice hath heard from certain persons, that the lady whom I named to thee while thou journeyedst full of sighs is sorely disquieted by thy solicitations: and therefore this most gracious creature, who is the enemy of all disquiet, being fearful of such disquiet, refused to salute thee. For the which reason (albeit, in very sooth, thy secret must needs have become known to her by familiar observation) it is my will that thou compose certain things in rhyme, in the which thou shalt set forth how strong a mastership I have obtained over thee, through her; and how thou wast hers even from thy childhood. Also do thou call upon him that knoweth these things to bear witness to them, bidding him to speak with her thereof; the which I, who am he, will do willingly. And thus she shall be made to know thy desire; knowing which, she shall know likewise that they were deceived who spake of thee to her. And so write these things, that they shall seem rather to be spoken by a third person; and not directly by thee to her, which is scarce fitting. After the which,"]]]
