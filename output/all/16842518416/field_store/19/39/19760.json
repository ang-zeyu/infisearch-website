And goodness knows too few Jerries come over our way to make us eager to share them with a couple of wild flying mad-men. So you both owe us an apology for poaching on our game grounds. But we'll take the apologies for granted. Sit down, you two. You deserve a chair at least, I fancy.\"  Dave came close to missing his chair, he was so surprised and relieved. He looked at the now grinning Group Captain and let his breath out slowly.  \"Gosh, sir,\" he gulped, \"I thought you meant it there for a minute.\"  \"I still do!\" the other said with a nod and a chuckle. \"It wasn't fair of you, at all. According to Major Barber you had your air sport earlier this morning. Not cricket, you know, to horn in on our doings. Congratulations, nevertheless. Fact is, those blighters might have done a bit of damage if you hadn't got at them so soon. My chaps must have been taking cat naps. Well, Farmer? Glad to be back in England?\"  \"Very much so, sir,\" Freddy replied, and beamed all over his face. \"One of the happiest moments of my life.\"  For a brief instant shadows crossed the Group Captain's face, and he looked grave and filled with concern.  \"I hope there will be many more, equally happy, Farmer,\" he said presently. \"No. Never mind the questions. I have no idea what's in store for you two. But I certainly know you were not brought back over here just to have a spot of leave. You'll doubtless learn soon enough, though. Meantime, I'd better get on with my part of the business--that is, give you the instructions Major Barber left with me.\"  \"Left!\" Dave gulped. \"You mean, sir, the Major has gone?\"  \"Quite,\" the other replied with a nod. \"While you two were stealing Jerry planes from us. I believe he had intended to remain awhile, but a call for him came through from your American Headquarters in London. I detailed him a plane, and a pilot to fly him up there.\"  \"And he left orders for us, you say, sir?\" Freddy Farmer prompted respectfully.  \"Quite correct,\" the senior officer told him. \"You are to remain here until you've had a bit of breakfast and some rest. Then I'm to detail you a two-seater plane. It's as if I were running a blasted aerial taxi company, or something. Anyway, sometime today, when it suits your collective fancy, you are to fly to the Lewes Base, on the South Downs, and report to the commanding officer. Squadron Leader Parkinson is his name. He has a Spitfire squadron. A fine bunch of lads, too. You'll like them all, I'm sure. Well, there're your orders as Major Barber left them with me. Now, how about a spot of food, eh?\"  Dave didn't move. He acted as though he had not heard the question. He simply sat staring puzzle-eyed at the Group Captain.  \"Report to a fighter squadron, sir?\" he murmured presently. \"You mean we're back in the R.A.F. again?\"  \"I don't mean anything of the sort,\" the senior officer replied with a little gesture, \"for the reason that I have no idea whatsoever. That's truth, really. I simply know that you are to report to Squadron Leader Parkinson's base. What happens after that, I haven't the faintest idea.\"  \"A bit queer and very hush-hush, for fair,\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and scowled at the opposite wall.  \"That's the blasted war for you,\" the Group Captain chuckled. \"Nothing means very much until after it's happened. However, much as the R.A.F. would like to have you back in its membership, I do not believe that is to be in your case. As I said, or should have said, neither of you was brought back to England for anything of the usual sort. A blind bloke can see that it's for some very important reason. And certainly most secretive, too.\"  \"You're telling us?\" Dave groaned, forgetful for the moment of the other's senior rank. \"It's plenty secret, and how! Freddy and I have been guessing our heads off since the start of this business, and neither of us can come up with anything that even seems close!\"  \"Phew, yes!\" Freddy breathed heavily. \"We Britishers are very good at the hush-hush business, but the Yanks are certainly going us one better this time. And if I don't get some kind of an inkling soon, I'll be going balmy.\"  \"Well, I wish I could help you out, but I can't,\" the Group Captain said with a sympathetic laugh. \"Sometimes, though, it's best not to know what one's in for--until it happens.\"  The somber note in the other's voice sent a little icy chill rippling through Dave. True enough, Freddy and he certainly hadn't come over to England just to have a good time. They had come over to take part in some Commando operation. That much Major Barber had admitted. But--and it was a big but--he had said they were to handle an extra, a very special job. What job? What kind of a job? Unfortunately, there just wasn't any answer to that one. The answer would be theirs--in the near future. Perhaps!  \"I get what you mean, sir,\" Dave said to the Group Captain with a faint grin. \"And maybe you're right, sir. But--well, just the same I don't go much for this sitting on pins and needles stuff. I think I'd rather know, and get my worrying over with first. As you say, though, that's war.\"  \"Quite,\" the senior officer grunted, and got up from his chair. \"So let's leave it at that, what, and have a bite to eat?\"  \"Absolutely, sir!\" Freddy cried, springing to his feet. \"No sense fighting a war on an empty stomach, if you don't have to.\"  \"Just name one time when yours was empty,\" Dave laughed.  \"Right now!\" the English youth snapped, and gave him a scornful look.  They followed the Group Captain out and over to the officers' mess. There they ate their fill, and when the senior officer had taken his departure they went outside and started wandering around the field. Their legs were still a little stiff from the Atlantic crossing, so a little exercise wouldn't do either of them any harm. At the end of an hour or so they had had enough. They hunted up a hutment orderly, and were shown a couple of bunks where they could catch up on a little much needed sleep and rest.  It was late in the afternoon when the orderly awakened them. He told them that there had been two raid alarms sounded while they had been asleep. However, no Jerry planes had put in an appearance.  \"The Commandant told me to find out when you would be taking off, Captains,\" the orderly added later. \"There're two Spitfires just ferried here from the factory, waiting on the tarmac. The Commandant says as how he would like you to deliver them to the squadron you're going to. Shall I have them revved up?\"  Dave dug sleep seeds out of his eyes and looked at Freddy. His pal did likewise, and nodded.  \"Might as well,\" he grunted. \"There's nothing more to be learned here. Might just as well get on with it.\"  \"Check,\" Dave said, and turned to the orderly. \"Do that, will you, and thanks.\"  Half an hour later the two air aces were out on the tarmac, and ready to leave. They were about to climb into their Spitfires when Group Captain Farnsworth came over to them.  \"Just wanted to say goodbye,\" he smiled, \"and wish you all kinds of luck.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Dave grinned. \"And we're sorry about those two Jerry planes. I promise that next time we won't be so selfish.\"  \"Oh, quite!\" Freddy Farmer echoed.  The Group Captain chuckled and made a little gesture with both hands.  \"That's quite all right, chaps,\" he said. \"All is forgiven, I assure you. Frankly, next time--if there is one--I hope you get double the number of blighters. Well, goodbye. Thumbs up, and all that sort of thing. I certainly envy you.\"  Dave shot him a sharp questioning look, but the Group Captain shook his head firmly.  \"No, I really don't know a thing, Dawson,\" he said. \"On my word, I don't. I'm just imagining, that's all. And there's blessed little else a Group Captain can do in this crazy war. Well, on with it, you chaps. And luck, again.\"  Dave and Freddy thanked him for his good wishes, shook hands, and then legged up into the pits of their Spitfires. They taxied out to the far end of the main runway, and waited there with props idling over for the signal from the Operations Tower. It came, and they gunned their engines together and went rocketing forward.  \"Well, here goes for the next stop,\" Dave grunted as he lifted his Spitfire clear, and nosed up and around toward the overcast sky. \"And I sure would like to know what is the next move in this cockeyed arrangement of things?\"  He spoke the question aloud, but the gods of war in their high places refused to answer. They simply nudged each other, grinned, and winked.     CHAPTER EIGHT  _Sudden Chaos_   \"This is getting me down, and giving me a sweet pain in the neck!\" Dave groaned, and rolled over on the grass. \"Do you think that Major Barber has forgotten us?\"  Freddy Farmer opened his eyes just to show that he was awake, and sighed contentedly.  \"Does it really matter?\" he murmured. \"Personally, this suits me quite nicely, thank you.\"  Dave scowled and contemplated jabbing Freddy in the ribs. But his pal looked so perfectly relaxed that he didn't have the heart to. So he simply deepened his scowl.  \"Fine guy, you are!\" he growled. \"A week ago you were as keen as mustard about what Major Barber cooked up for us. And now? Now you're just a lazy bum!\"  Freddy opened one eye and glared.  \"That's a downright lie, my good man!\" he snapped. \"I got a Messerschmitt One-Nine yesterday, didn't I? And one of those new Focke-Wulf One-Nineties the day before? What more do you want?\"  \"Action!\" Dave grunted, and stared brooding-eyed at the row of Spitfires on the near side of the field. \"I admit it's swell to be serving with an R.A.F. fighter squadron again. It's okay, but--but, doggone it, we didn't come way over here for this! Even Group Captain Farnsworth agreed with that. But it's been a whole week now since we arrived here. I'm beginning not to know what to think, or hope.\"  \"Then don't do either,\" Freddy commented sleepily. \"Terrible strain on the brain, you know.

Howard      [Transcriber's Note: This etext was first published in Weird Tales     May and June 1935. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence     that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]     1 Conan Loses His Ax   The stillness of the forest trail was so primeval that the tread of a soft-booted foot was a startling disturbance. At least it seemed so to the ears of the wayfarer, though he was moving along the path with the caution that must be practised by any man who ventures beyond Thunder River. He was a young man of medium height, with an open countenance and a mop of tousled tawny hair unconfined by cap or helmet. His garb was common enough for that country--a coarse tunic, belted at the waist, short leather breeches beneath, and soft buckskin boots that came short of the knee. A knife-hilt jutted from one boot-top. The broad leather belt supported a short, heavy sword and a buckskin pouch. There was no perturbation in the wide eyes that scanned the green walls which fringed the trail. Though not tall, he was well built, and the arms that the short wide sleeves of the tunic left bare were thick with corded muscle.  He tramped imperturbably along, although the last settler's cabin lay miles behind him, and each step was carrying him nearer the grim peril that hung like a brooding shadow over the ancient forest.  He was not making as much noise as it seemed to him, though he well knew that the faint tread of his booted feet would be like a tocsin of alarm to the fierce ears that might be lurking in the treacherous green fastness. His careless attitude was not genuine; his eyes and ears were keenly alert, especially his ears, for no gaze could penetrate the leafy tangle for more than a few feet in either direction.  But it was instinct more than any warning by the external senses which brought him up suddenly, his hand on his hilt. He stood stock-still in the middle of the trail, unconsciously holding his breath, wondering what he had heard, and wondering if indeed he had heard anything. The silence seemed absolute. Not a squirrel chattered or bird chirped. Then his gaze fixed itself on a mass of bushes beside the trail a few yards ahead of him. There was no breeze, yet he had seen a branch quiver. The short hairs on his scalp prickled, and he stood for an instant undecided, certain that a move in either direction would bring death streaking at him from the bushes.  A heavy chopping crunch sounded behind the leaves. The bushes were shaken violently, and simultaneously with the sound, an arrow arched erratically from among them and vanished among the trees along the trail. The wayfarer glimpsed its flight as he sprang frantically to cover.  Crouching behind a thick stem, his sword quivering in his fingers, he saw the bushes part, and a tall figure stepped leisurely into the trail. The traveler stared in surprise. The stranger was clad like himself in regard to boots and breeks, though the latter were of silk instead of leather. But he wore a sleeveless hauberk of dark mesh-mail in place of a tunic, and a helmet perched on his black mane. That helmet held the other's gaze; it was without a crest, but adorned by short bull's horns. No civilized hand ever forged that head-piece. Nor was the face below it that of a civilized man: dark, scarred, with smoldering blue eyes, it was a face untamed as the primordial forest which formed its background. The man held a broadsword in his right hand, and the edge was smeared with crimson.  'Come on out,' he called, in an accent unfamiliar to the wayfarer. 'All's safe now. There was only one of the dogs. Come on out.'  The other emerged dubiously and stared at the stranger. He felt curiously helpless and futile as he gazed on the proportions of the forest man--the massive iron-clad breast, and the arm that bore the reddened sword, burned dark by the sun and ridged and corded with muscles. He moved with the dangerous ease of a panther; he was too fiercely supple to be a product of civilization, even of that fringe of civilization which composed the outer frontiers.  Turning, he stepped back to the bushes and pulled them apart. Still not certain just what had happened, the wayfarer from the east advanced and stared down into the bushes. A man lay there, a short, dark, thickly-muscled man, naked except for a loin-cloth, a necklace of human teeth and a brass armlet. A short sword was thrust into the girdle of the loin-cloth, and one hand still gripped a heavy black bow. The man had long black hair; that was about all the wayfarer could tell about his head, for his features were a mask of blood and brains. His skull had been split to the teeth.  'A Pict, by the gods!' exclaimed the wayfarer.  The burning blue eyes turned upon him.  'Are you surprised?'  'Why, they told me at Velitrium and again at the settlers' cabins along the road, that these devils sometimes sneaked across the border, but I didn't expect to meet one this far in the interior.'  'You're only four miles east of Black River,' the stranger informed him. 'They've been shot within a mile of Velitrium. No settler between Thunder River and Fort Tuscelan is really safe. I picked up this dog's trail three miles south of the fort this morning, and I've been following him ever since. I came up behind him just as he was drawing an arrow on you. Another instant and there'd have been a stranger in Hell. But I spoiled his aim for him.'  The wayfarer was staring wide-eyed at the larger man, dumfounded by the realization that the man had actually tracked down one of the forest-devils and slain him unsuspected. That implied woodsmanship of a quality undreamed, even for Conajohara.  'You are one of the fort's garrison?' he asked.  'I'm no soldier. I draw the pay and rations of an officer of the line, but I do my work in the woods. Valannus knows I'm of more use ranging along the river than cooped up in the fort.'  Casually the slayer shoved the body deeper into the thickets with his foot, pulled the bushes together and turned away down the trail. The other followed him.  'My name is Balthus,' he offered. 'I was at Velitrium last night. I haven't decided whether I'll take up a hide of land, or enter fort-service.'  'The best land near Thunder River is already taken,' grunted the slayer. 'Plenty of good land between Scalp Creek--you crossed it a few miles back--and the fort, but that's getting too devilish close to the river. The Picts steal over to burn and murder--as that one did. They don't always come singly. Some day they'll try to sweep the settlers out of Conajohara. And they may succeed--probably will succeed. This colonization business is mad, anyway. There's plenty of good land east of the Bossonian marches. If the Aquilonians would cut up some of the big estates of their barons, and plant wheat where now only deer are hunted, they wouldn't have to cross the border and take the land of the Picts away from them.'  'That's queer talk from a man in the service of the Governor of Conajohara,' objected Balthus.  'It's nothing to me,' the other retorted. 'I'm a mercenary. I sell my sword to the highest bidder. I never planted wheat and never will, so long as there are other harvests to be reaped with the sword. But you Hyborians have expanded as far as you'll be allowed to expand. You've crossed the marches, burned a few villages, exterminated a few clans and pushed back the frontier to Black River; but I doubt if you'll even be able to hold what you've conquered, and you'll never push the frontier any further westward. Your idiotic king doesn't understand conditions here. He won't send you enough reinforcements, and there are not enough settlers to withstand the shock of a concerted attack from across the river.'  'But the Picts are divided into small clans,' persisted Balthus. 'they'll never unite. We can whip any single clan.'  'Or any three or four clans,' admitted the slayer. 'But some day a man will rise and unite thirty or forty clans, just as was done among the Cimmerians, when the Gundermen tried to push the border northward, years ago. They tried to colonize the southern marches of Cimmeria: destroyed a few small clans, built a fort-town, Venarium--you've heard the tale.'  'So I have indeed,' replied Balthus, wincing. The memory of that red disaster was a black blot in the chronicles of a proud and war-like people. 'My uncle was at Venarium when the Cimmerians swarmed over the walls. He was one of the few who escaped that slaughter. I've heard him tell the tale, many a time. The barbarians swept out of the hills in a ravening horde, without warning, and stormed Venarium with such fury none could stand before them. Men, women and children were butchered. Venarium was reduced to a mass of charred ruins, as it is to this day. The Aquilonians were driven back across the marches, and have never since tried to colonize the Cimmerian country. But you speak of Venarium familiarly. Perhaps you were there?'  'I was,' grunted the other. 'I was one of the horde that swarmed over the hills. I hadn't yet seen fifteen snows, but already my name was repeated about the council fires.'  Balthus involuntarily recoiled, staring. It seemed incredible that the man walking tranquilly at his side should have been one of those screeching, blood-mad devils that had poured over the walls of Venarium on that long-gone day to make her streets run crimson.  'Then you, too, are a barbarian!' he exclaimed involuntarily.  The other nodded, without taking offence.  'I am Conan, a Cimmerian.'  'I've heard of you.' Fresh interest quickened Balthus' gaze. No wonder the Pict had fallen victim to his own sort of subtlety. The Cimmerians were barbarians as ferocious as the Picts, and much more intelligent. Evidently Conan had spent much time among civilized men, though that contact had obviously not softened him, nor weakened any of his primitive instincts. Balthus'"]]]
