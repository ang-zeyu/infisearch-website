Nor was an element of fun lacking.  A Second Lieutenant was ordered to take a party of skirmishers to the top of a hill and engage those of the Rebels stationed on another hill-top across a ravine.  He had but lately joined us from the Regular Army, where he was a Drill Sergeant. Naturally, he was very methodical in his way, and scorned to do otherwise under fire than he would upon the parade ground.  He moved his little command to the hill-top, in close order, and faced them to the front. The Johnnies received them with a yell and a volley, whereat the boys winced a little, much to the Lieutenant's disgust, who swore at them; then had them count off with great deliberation, and deployed them as coolly as if them was not an enemy within a hundred miles.  After the line deployed, he \"dressed\" it, commanded \"Front!\" and \"Begin, firing!\" his attention was called another way for an instant, and when he looked back again, there was not a man of his nicely formed skirmish line visible.  The logs and stones had evidently been put there for the use of skirmishers, the boys thought, and in an instant they availed themselves of their shelter.  Never was there an angrier man than that Second Lieutenant; he brandished his saber and swore; he seemed to feel that all his soldierly reputation was gone, but the boys stuck to their shelter for all that, informing him that when the Rebels would stand out in the open field and take their fire, they would likewise.  Despite all our efforts, the Rebel line crawled up closer an closer to us; we were driven back from knoll to knoll, and from one fence after another.  We had maintained the unequal struggle for eight hours; over one-fourth of our number were stretched upon the snow, killed or badly wounded.  Our cartridges were nearly all gone; the cannon had fired its last shot long ago, and having a blank cartridge left, had shot the rammer at a gathering party of the enemy.  Just as the Winter sun was going down upon a day of gloom the bugle called us all up on the hillside.  Then the Rebels saw for the first time how few there were, and began an almost simultaneous charge all along the line.  The Major raised piece of a shelter tent upon a pole.  The line halted.  An officer rode out from it, followed by two privates.  Approaching the Major, he said, \"Who is in command this force?\"  The Major replied: \"I am.\"  \"Then, Sir, I demand your sword.\"  \"What is your rank, Sir!\"  \"I am Adjutant of the Sixty-fourth Virginia.\"  The punctillious soul of the old \"Regular\"--for such the Major was swelled up instantly, and he answered:  \"By ---, sir, I will never surrender to my inferior in rank!\"  The Adjutant reined his horse back.  His two followers leveled their pieces at the Major and waited orders to fire.  They were covered by a dozen carbines in the hands of our men.  The Adjutant ordered his men to \"recover arms,\" and rode away with them.  He presently returned with a Colonel, and to him the Major handed his saber.  As the men realized what was being done, the first thought of many of them was to snatch out the cylinder's of their revolvers, and the slides of their carbines, and throw them away, so as to make the arms useless.  We were overcome with rage and humiliation at being compelled to yield to an enemy whom we had hated so bitterly.  As we stood there on the bleak mountain-side, the biting wind soughing through the leafless branches, the shadows of a gloomy winter night closing around us, the groans and shrieks of our wounded mingling with the triumphant yells of the Rebels plundering our tents, it seemed as if Fate could press to man's lips no cup with bitterer dregs in it than this.     CHAPTER V.  THE REACTION--DEPRESSION--BITTING COLD--SHARP HUNGER AND SAD REFLEXION.            \"Of being taken by the Insolent foe.\"--Othello.   The night that followed was inexpressibly dreary: The high-wrought nervous tension, which had been protracted through the long hours that the fight lasted, was succeeded by a proportionate mental depression, such as naturally follows any strain upon the mind.  This was intensified in our cases by the sharp sting of defeat, the humiliation of having to yield ourselves, our horses and our arms into the possession of the enemy, the uncertainty as to the future, and the sorrow we felt at the loss of so many of our comrades.  Company L had suffered very severely, but our chief regret was for the gallant Osgood, our Second Lieutenant.  He, above all others, was our trusted leader.  The Captain and First Lieutenant were brave men, and good enough soldiers, but Osgood was the one \"whose adoption tried, we grappled to our souls with hooks of steel.\"  There was never any difficulty in getting all the volunteers he wanted for a scouting party. A quiet, pleasant spoken gentleman, past middle age, he looked much better fitted for the office of Justice of the Peace, to which his fellow-citizens of Urbana, Illinois, had elected and reelected him, than to command a troop of rough riders in a great civil war.  But none more gallant than he ever vaulted into saddle to do battle for the right. He went into the Army solely as a matter of principle, and did his duty with the unflagging zeal of an olden Puritan fighting for liberty and his soul's salvation.  He was a superb horseman--as all the older Illinoisans are and, for all his two-score years and ten, he recognized few superiors for strength and activity in the Battalion.  A radical, uncompromising Abolitionist, he had frequently asserted that he would rather die than yield to a Rebel, and he kept his word in this as in everything else.  As for him, it was probably the way he desired to die.  No one believed more ardently than he that                 Whether on the scaffold high,                Or in the battle's van;                The fittest place for man to die,                Is where he dies for man.  Among the many who had lost chums and friends was Ned Johnson, of Company K.  Ned was a young Englishman, with much of the suggestiveness of the bull-dog common to the lower class of that nation.  His fist was readier than his tongue.  His chum, Walter Savage was of the same surly type. The two had come from England twelve years before, and had been together ever since.  Savage was killed in the struggle for the fence described in the preceding chapter.  Ned could not realize for a while that his friend was dead.  It was only when the body rapidly stiffened on its icy bed, and the eyes which had been gleaming deadly hate when he was stricken down were glazed over with the dull film of death, that he believed he was gone from him forever.  Then his rage was terrible.  For the rest of the day he was at the head of every assault upon the enemy.  His voice could ever be heard above the firing, cursing the Rebels bitterly, and urging the boys to \"Stand up to 'em!  Stand right up to 'em!  Don't give a inch!  Let them have the best you got in the shop!  Shoot low, and don't waste a cartridge!\"  When we surrendered, Ned seemed to yield sullenly to the inevitable. He threw his belt and apparently his revolver with it upon the snow. A guard was formed around us, and we gathered about the fires that were started.  Ned sat apart, his arms folded, his head upon his breast, brooding bitterly upon Walter's death.  A horseman, evidently a Colonel or General, clattered up to give some directions concerning us.  At the sound of his voice Ned raised his head and gave him a swift glance; the gold stars upon the Rebel's collar led him to believe that he was the commander of the enemy.  Ned sprang to his feet, made a long stride forward, snatched from the breast of his overcoat the revolver he had been hiding there, cocked it and leveled it at the Rebel's breast. Before he could pull the trigger Orderly Sergeant Charles Bentley, of his Company, who was watching him, leaped forward, caught his wrist and threw the revolver up.  Others joined in, took the weapon away, and handed it over to the officer, who then ordered us all to be searched for arms, and rode away.  All our dejection could not make us forget that we were intensely hungry. We had eaten nothing all day.  The fight began before we had time to get any breakfast, and of course there was no interval for refreshments during the engagement.  The Rebels were no better off than we, having been marched rapidly all night in order to come upon us by daylight.  Late in the evening a few sacks of meal were given us, and we took the first lesson in an art that long and painful practice afterward was to make very familiar to us.  We had nothing to mix the meal in, and it looked as if we would have to eat it dry, until a happy thought struck some one that our caps would do for kneading troughs.  At once every cap was devoted to this.  Getting water from an adjacent spring, each man made a little wad of dough--unsalted--and spreading it upon a flat stone or a chip, set it up in front of the fire to bake.  As soon as it was browned on one side, it was pulled off the stone, and the other side turned to the fire.  It was a very primitive way of cooking and I became thoroughly disgusted with it.  It was fortunate for me that I little dreamed that this was the way I should have to get my meals for the next fifteen months.  After somewhat of the edge had been taken off our hunger by this food, we crouched around the fires, talked over the events of the day, speculated as to what was to be done with us, and snatched such sleep as the biting cold would permit.     CHAPTER VI.  \"ON TO RICHMOND!\"--MARCHING ON FOOT OVER THE MOUNTAINS--MY HORSE HAS A NEW RIDER--UNSOPHISTICATED MOUNTAIN GIRLS--DISCUSSING THE ISSUES OF THE WAR--PARTING WITH \"HIATOGA.\"  At dawn we were gathered together, more meal issued to us, which we cooked in the same way, and then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4257"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 1 (#7)"],["body"," started under heavy guard to march on foot over the mountains to Bristol, a station at the point where the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad crosses the line between Virginia and Tennessee.  As we were preparing to set out a Sergeant of the First Virginia cavalry came galloping up to us on my horse!  The sight of my faithful \"Hiatoga\" bestrid by a Rebel, wrung my heart.  During the action I had forgotten him, but when it ceased I began to worry about his fate.  As he and his rider came near I called out to him; he stopped and gave a whinny of recognition, which seemed also a plaintive appeal for an explanation of the changed condition of affairs.  The Sergeant was a pleasant, gentlemanly boy of about my own age. He rode up to me and inquired if it was my horse, to which I replied in the affirmative, and asked permission to take from the saddle pockets some letters, pictures and other trinkets.  He granted this, and we became friends from thence on until we separated.  He rode by my side as we plodded over the steep, slippery hills, and we beguiled the way by chatting of the thousand things that soldiers find to talk about, and exchanged reminiscences of the service on both sides.  But the subject he was fondest of was that which I relished least: my--now his--horse.  Into the open ulcer of my heart he poured the acid of all manner of questions concerning my lost steed's qualities and capabilities: would he swim? how was he in fording?  did he jump well!  how did he stand fire? I smothered my irritation, and answered as pleasantly as I could.  In the afternoon of the third day after the capture, we came up to where a party of rustic belles were collected at \"quilting.\"  The \"Yankees\" were instantly objects of greater interest than the parade of a menagerie would have been.  The Sergeant told the girls we were going to camp for the night a mile or so ahead, and if they would be at a certain house, he would have a Yankee for them for close inspection.  After halting, the Sergeant obtained leave to take me out with a guard, and I was presently ushered into a room in which the damsels were massed in force, --a carnation-checked, staring, open-mouthed, linsey-clad crowd, as ignorant of corsets and gloves as of Hebrew, and with a propensity to giggle that was chronic and irrepressible.  When we entered the room there was a general giggle, and then a shower of comments upon my appearance,--each sentence punctuated with the chorus of feminine cachination.  A remark was made about my hair and eyes, and their risibles gave way; judgment was passed on my nose, and then came a ripple of laughter.  I got very red in the face, and uncomfortable generally. Attention was called to the size of my feet and hands, and the usual chorus followed.  Those useful members of my body seemed to swell up as they do to a young man at his first party.  Then I saw that in the minds of these bucolic maidens I was scarcely, if at all, human; they did not understand that I belonged to the race; I was a \"Yankee\"--a something of the non-human class, as the gorilla or the chimpanzee.  They felt as free to discuss my points before my face as they would to talk of a horse or a wild animal in a show.  My equanimity was partially restored by this reflection, but I was still too young to escape embarrassment and irritation at being thus dissected and giggled at by a party of girls, even if they were ignorant Virginia mountaineers.  I turned around to speak to the Sergeant, and in so doing showed my back to the ladies.  The hum of comment deepened into surprise, that half stopped and then intensified the giggle.  I was puzzled for a minute, and then the direction of their glances, and their remarks explained it all.  At the rear of the lower part of the cavalry jacket, about where the upper ornamental buttons are on the tail of a frock coat, are two funny tabs, about the size of small pin-cushions.  They are fastened by the edge, and stick out straight behind. Their use is to support the heavy belt in the rear, as the buttons do in front.  When the belt is off it would puzzle the Seven Wise Men to guess what they are for.  The unsophisticated young ladies, with that swift intuition which is one of lovely woman's salient mental traits, immediately jumped at the conclusion that the projections covered some peculiar conformation of the Yankee anatomy--some incipient, dromedary-like humps, or perchance the horns of which they had heard so much.  This anatomical phenomena was discussed intently for a few minutes, during which I heard one of the girls inquire whether \"it would hurt him to cut 'em off?\" and another hazarded the opinion that \"it would probably bleed him to death.\"  Then a new idea seized them, and they said to the Sergeant \"Make him sing!  Make him sing!\"  This was too much for the Sergeant, who had been intensely amused at the girls' wonderment.  He turned to me, very red in the face, with:  \"Sergeant: the girls want to hear you sing.\"  I replied that I could not sing a note.  Said he:  \"Oh, come now.  I know better than that; I never seed or heerd of a Yankee that couldn't sing.\"  I nevertheless assured him that there really were some Yankees that did not have any musical accomplishments, and that I was one of that unfortunate number.  I asked him to get the ladies to sing for me, and to this they acceded quite readily.  One girl, with a fair soprano, who seemed to be the leader of the crowd, sang \"The Homespun Dress,\" a song very popular in the South, and having the same tune as the \"Bonnie Blue Flag.\"  It began,                 I envy not the Northern girl                Their silks and jewels fine,  and proceeded to compare the homespun habiliments of the Southern women to the finery and frippery of the ladies on the other side of Mason and Dixon's line in a manner very disadvantageous to the latter.  The rest of the girls made a fine exhibition of the lung-power acquired in climbing their precipitous mountains, when they came in on the chorus                 Hurra!  Hurra! for southern rights Hurra!                Hurra for the homespun dress,                The Southern ladies wear.  This ended the entertainment.  On our journey to Bristol we met many Rebel soldiers, of all ranks, and a small number of citizens.  As the conscription had then been enforced pretty sharply for over a year the only able-bodied men seen in civil life were those who had some trade which exempted them from being forced into active service.  It greatly astonished us at first to find that nearly all the mechanics were included among the exempts, or could be if they chose; but a very little reflection showed us the wisdom of such a policy.  The South is as nearly a purely agricultural country as is Russia or South America.  The people have, little inclination or capacity for anything else than pastoral pursuits.  Consequently mechanics are very scarce, and manufactories much scarcer.  The limited quantity of products of mechanical skill needed by the people was mostly imported from the North or Europe.  Both these sources of supply were cutoff by the war, and the country was thrown upon its own slender manufacturing resources.  To force its mechanics into the army would therefore be suicidal.  The Army would gain a few thousand men, but its operations would be embarrassed, if not stopped altogether, by a want of supplies.  This condition of affairs reminded one of the singular paucity of mechanical skill among the Bedouins of the desert, which renders the life of a blacksmith sacred.  No matter how bitter the feud between tribes, no one will kill the other's workers of iron, and instances are told of warriors saving their lives at critical periods by falling on their knees and making with their garments an imitation of the action of a smith's bellows.  All whom we met were eager to discuss with us the causes, phases and progress of the war, and whenever opportunity offered or could be made, those of us who were inclined to talk were speedily involved in an argument with crowds of soldiers and citizens.  But, owing to the polemic poverty of our opponents, the argument was more in name than in fact. Like all people of slender or untrained intellectual powers they labored under the hallucination that asserting was reasoning, and the emphatic reiteration of bald statements, logic.  The narrow round which all from highest to lowest--traveled was sometimes comical, and sometimes irritating, according to one's mood!  The dispute invariably began by their asking:  \"Well, what are you 'uns down here a-fightin' we 'uns for?\"  As this was replied to the newt one followed:  \"Why are you'uns takin' our niggers away from we 'uns for?\"  Then came:  \"What do you 'uns put our niggers to fightin' we'uns for?\"  The windup always was: \"Well, let me tell you, sir, you can never whip people that are fighting for liberty, sir.\"  Even General Giltner, who had achieved considerable military reputation as commander of a division of Kentucky cavalry, seemed to be as slenderly furnished with logical ammunition as the balance, for as he halted by us he opened the conversation with the well-worn formula:  \"Well: what are you 'uns down here a-fighting we'uns for?\"  The question had become raspingly monotonous to me, whom he addressed, and I replied with marked acerbity:  \"Because we are the Northern mudsills whom you affect to despise, and we came down here to lick you into respecting us.\"  The answer seemed to tickle him, a pleasanter light came into his sinister gray eyes, he laughed lightly, and bade us a kindly good day.  Four days after our capture we arrived in Bristol.  The guards who had brought us over the mountains were relieved by others, the Sergeant bade me good by, struck his spurs into \"Hiatoga's\" sides, and he and my faithful horse were soon lost to view in the darkness.  A new and keener sense of desolation came over me at the final separation from my tried and true four-footed"]]]
