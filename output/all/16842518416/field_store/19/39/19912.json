His presence in the buggy with his father was not incidental; it was the doctor's design. He wished to have the boy along during these formative years in order that he might get the right start toward the great things of life as these one by one begin to break in upon the attention of a growing boy. The doctor wanted to be the first to talk with him--the first to sow the right suggestions: it was one of his sayings that the earliest suggestions rooted in the mind of the child will be the final things to drop from the dying man's brain: what goes in first comes out last.  And so there began to be many conversations; incredible questions; answers not always forthcoming. And a series of revelations ensued; the boy revealing his growth to a watchful father, and a father revealing his life to a very watchful son! These revelations began to look like mile-stones on life's road, marked with further understandings.  Thus, one day when the boy was a good deal younger than now, his father had come home and had gotten ready to go away again and was sitting before the fire, looking gravely into it and taking solitary counsel about some desperate case, as the country doctor must often do. Being a very little fellow then, he had straddled one of his father's mighty legs and had balanced himself by resting his hands on his father's mighty shoulders.  \"Is somebody very sick?\"  The head under the weather-roughened hat nodded silently.  \"I wonder how it happens that all the sick are in our neighborhood.\"  A smile flitted across the doctor's mouth.  \"The sick are in all neighborhoods, little wonderer.\"  He said this cheerfully. It was his idea--and he tried to enforce it at home--that young children must never, if possible, make the acquaintance of the words _bad_ and _sad_--nor of the realities that are masked behind them. He especially believed that what the old are familiar with as life's tragic laws ought never to be told to children as tragic: what is inevitable should never be presented to them as misfortunes.  Therefore he now declared that the sick are in all neighborhoods as he might have stated that there are wings on all birds, or leaves on all growing apple trees.  \"Not all over the world?\" asked the boy, enlarging his vision in space.  \"All over the world,\" admitted the doctor with entire cheerfulness; the fact was a matter of no consequence.  \"Not all the time?\" asked the boy, enlarging his outlook in time.  \"All the time! All over the world and all the time!\" conceded the doctor, as though this made not the slightest difference to a human being.  \"Isn't there a single minute when everybody is well everywhere?\"  \"Not a single, solitary minute.\"  \"Then somebody must always be suffering.\"  The doctor nodded again; the matter was not worth speaking of.  \"Then somebody else must always be sorry.\"  The doctor bowed encouragingly.  \"_Then I am sorry, too!_\"  This time the doctor did not move his head, and he did not open his lips. He saw that a new moment had arrived in the boy's growth--a consciousness of the universal tragedy and personal share and sorrow in it. He knew that many people never feel this; some feel it late; a few feel it early; he had always said that children should never feel it. He knew also that when once it has begun, it never ends. Nothing ever banishes it or stills it--that perception of the human tragedy and one's share and sorrow in it.  He did not welcome its appearance now, in his son least of all. For an instant he charged himself with having made a mistake in taking the child along on his visits to the sick, thus making known too early the dark side of happy neighborhood life. Then he went further back and traced this premature seriousness to its home and its beginning: in prenatal depression--in a mother's anguish and a wife's despair. It was a bitter retrospect: it kept him brooding.  The chatter was persistent. A hand was stretched up, and it took hold of his chin and shook it:--  \"There ought to be a country where nobody suffers and there ought to be a time; a large country and a long time.\"  \"There is such a country and there is such a time, Herbert,\" said the doctor, now with some sadness.  \"Then I'll warrant you it's part of the United States,\" cried the boy, getting his idea of mortality slightly mixed with his early Americanism. \"Texas would hold them, wouldn't it? Don't you think Texas could contain them all and contain them forever?\"  The doctor laughed and seemed to think enough had been said on the subject of large enough graveyards for the race.  \"Why don't you doctors send your patients to that country?\"  \"Perhaps we do sometimes!\" The doctor laughed again.  \"Do you ever send yours?\"  \"Possibly.\"  \"And how many do _you_ send?\"  \"I don't know!\" exclaimed the doctor, laughing this time without being wholly amused. \"I don't know, and I never intend to try to find out.\"  \"When I grow up we'll practise together and send twice as many,\" the boy said, looking into his father's eyes with the flattery of professional imitation.  \"So we will! There'll be no trouble about that! Twice as many, perhaps three times! No trouble whatever!\"  He took the hands from his shoulders and laid them in the palm of his and studied them--those masculine boyish hands that had never touched any of the world's suffering. And then he looked at his own hands which had handled so much of the world's suffering, but had never reached happiness; happiness which for years had dwelt just at his finger-tips but beyond arm's reach.  Not very long afterwards another conversation lettered another mile-stone in the progress of mutual understanding.  It was a beautiful drowsy May morning near noon, and the two were driving slowly homeward along the turnpike. When the lazily trotting horse reached the front gate of a certain homestead, he stopped and threw one ear backward as a living interrogation point. As his answer, he got an unexpected cut in the flank with the tip of the lash that was like the sting of a hornet: a reminder that the driver was not alone in the buggy; that the horse should have known he was not alone; and that what he did when alone was a matter of confidence between master and beast.  The boy, who had been thrown backward, heels high, laughed as he settled himself again on his cushion:--  \"He thought you wanted to turn in.\"  \"He thinks too much--sometimes.\"  \"Don't they ever get sick there?\"  \"I suppose they do.\"  \"_Then_ you turn in!\"  \"Then I _don't_ turn in.\"  \"Aren't you their doctor?\"  \"I was the doctor once.\"  \"Where was I?\"  \"I don't know where you were; you were not born.\"  \"So many things happened before I was born; I wish they hadn't!\"  \"It is a pity; I had the same experience.\"  The buggy rolled slowly along homeward. On one side of the road were fields of young Indian corn, the swordlike blades flashing in the sun; on the other side fields of red clover blooming; the fragrance was wafted over the fence to the buggy. Further, in a soft grassy lawn, on a little knoll shaded by a white ash, a group of sleek cattle stood content in their blameless world. Over the prostrate cows one lordly head, its incurved horns deep hidden by its curls, kept guard. The scene was a living Kentucky replica of Paul Potter's _Bull_.  \"Drive!\" murmured the doctor, handing over the reins; and he drew his hat low over his eyes and set his shoulder against his corner of the buggy; he often caught up with sleep while on the road. And he often tried to catch up with thinking.  The horse always knew when the reins changed hands. He disregarded the proxy, kept his own gait, picked the best of the road, and turned out for passing vehicles. The boy now grasped the lines with unexpected positiveness; and he leaned over and looked up under the rim of his father's hat:--  \"I hope the doctor they employ will give them the wrong medicines,\" he confided. \"I hope the last one of them will have many a rattling good bellyache for their meanness to you!\"                                 * * * * *   Then more years for father and son, each finding the other out.  And now finally on the morning of that twenty-fourth day of December, the father was to witness a scene in the drama of his life as amazingly performed by his son--illustrating what a little actor can do when he undertakes to imitate an old actor to whom he is most loyal.  That morning after breakfast the apt pupil in Life's School had been sent for, and when he had entered the library, his father was sitting before the fire, idle. The buggy was not waiting outside; the hat and overcoat and gloves were nowhere in sight; and he had not gotten ready his satchel which took the place of the saddlebags of earlier generations when the country doctor travelled around on horseback and carried the honey of physic packed at his thighs--like a wingless, befattened bumblebee. This morning it looked as though all the sick were well at last; it was a sound if wicked world; and nothing was left for a physician but to be happy in it--without a profession--and without wickedness.  He threw himself into his father's impulsively opened arms, and was heaved high into his lap. Though he was growing rather mature for laps now; he was beginning to speculate about having something of a lap of his own; quite a good deal of a lap.  \"How is the children's epidemic to-day?\"  \"Never you mind about the children's epidemic! I'll take care of the children's epidemic,\" repeated the doctor, pulling the long-faced, autumn-faced prodigy of all questions between his knees and looking him over with secret solicitude. \"We'll not talk about sick children, but about two well children--thanked be the Father of all children! So you and Elsie are going away to help celebrate a Christmas Tree.\"  \"Yes; but when are you going to have a Christmas Tree of our own?\"  Now, that subject had two prongs, and the doctor seized the prong that did not pierce family affairs--did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42923"],["title","The Doctor's Christmas Eve (#7)"],["body","_him_. He settled down to the subject with splendid warmth and heartiness:--  \"Well, let me see! You may have your first Christmas Tree as soon as you are old enough to commence to do things for other people; as soon as you can receive into your head the smallest hard pill of an idea about your duty to millions and millions and millions of your fellow medicine takers. Can you understand that?\"  \"Gracious! That would be a _big_ pill--larger than my head! I don't see what it has to do with one miserable little dead pine tree!\"  The doctor roared.  \"It has this to do with one miserable dead pine tree: don't you know yet that Christmas Trees are in memory of a boy who was once exactly your age and height--and perhaps with your appetite--and with just as many eyes and possibly even more questions? The boy grew up to be a man. The man became a teacher. The teacher became a neighborhood doctor. The neighborhood doctor became the greatest physician of the world--and he never took a fee!\"  \"Ah, yes! But he wasn't a better doctor than _you_ are, was he? If he'd come into this neighborhood and tried to practise, you'd soon have ousted him, wouldn't you, with your doses and soups and jellies?\"  \"Humph!\" grunted the doctor with a wry twist of the mouth; \"I suppose I would! Yes; undoubtedly I'd have ousted him! He could never have competed with me in _my_ practice; never! But we won't try that hard little pill of an idea any more. We'll drop the subject of Christmas Trees for one more year. Perhaps by that time you can take the pill as a powder! So! I hear you are going to attend a dancing party; we'll talk about the party. And you are going over there to stay all night. I wish I were going. I wish I were going over there to stay all night,\" reiterated the man, with an outrush of solemn tenderness that reached back through vain years, through so many parched, unfilled years.  \"I wish so, too,\" cried the boy, instantly burying his face on his father's coat-sleeve, then lifting it again and looking at him with a guilty flush which the doctor did not observe.  \"Oh, do you! We won't say anything more about that, though I'm glad you'd like to have me along. Now then; go and have a good time! And take long steps and large mouthfuls! And you might do well to remember that a boy's stomach is not a birdnest to be lined with candy eggs.\"  \"I think candy eggs would make a very good lining, better than real eggs; and about half the time you're trying to line me with them, aren't you? With all the sulphur in them! And I do hate sulphur, and I have always hated it since the boy at my desk in school wore a bag of it around his neck under his shirt to keep off diseases. My! how he smelt--worse than contagion! Candy eggs would make a very good lining; even the regular soldiers get candy in their rations now. And they don't have to eat new-laid eggs of mornings! Think of an army having to win a hard-fought battle on soft-boiled eggs! They don't have to do _that_, do they?\"  \"They do not!\" said the doctor. \"They positively do not! But we won't say anything more about eggs--saccharine or sulphurous. What are you going to do at the party?\"  \"I am going to dance.\"  \"Alone? O dear! All alone? You'd better go skate on the ice! Not all alone?\"  \"I should say not! With my girl, of course.\"  \"That's better, much better. And then what?\"  \"I am going to promenade, with my girl on my arm.\"  \"On _both_ arms, did you say?\"  \"No; on _one_ arm.\"  \"Which?\"  \"Either.\"  \"That sounds natural! (Heart action regular; brain unclouded; temperature normal.) And then? What next?\"  \"I'm going to take the darling in to supper.\"  \"Hold on! Not so fast! Suppose there isn't any supper--for the darling.\"  \"Don't say that! It would nearly kill me! Don't you suppose there'll be any supper?\"  \"I'm afraid there will be. Well, after the darling has had her fatal supper? (Of course you won't want any!) What then?\"  \"What else is there to do?\"  \"You don't look as innocent as you imagine!\"  \"You don't have to confess what you'd like to do, do you? Would you have told your father?\"  \"I don't think I would.\"  \"Then I won't tell you.\"  \"Then you needn't! I don't wish to know--only it must _not_ be on the cheek! Remember, you are no son of mine if it's on the cheek!\"  \"I thought I heard you say _that_ got people into trouble.\"  \"Maybe I did. I ought to have said it if I didn't; and it seems to be the kind of trouble that you are trying to get into. (Temperature rising but still normal. Respiration deeper. All symptoms favorable. No further bulletins deemed necessary.) Well, then? Where were we?\"  \"Anyhow, I've never thought of cheeks when I've thought of _that_; I thought cheeks were for chewing.\"  \"Guardian Powers of our erring reason! Where did you get that idea--if sanity can call it an idea?\"  \"Watching our cows.\"  The doctor laughed till tears ran down his face.  \"You can't learn much about kissing by watching anybody's _cows_, Governor,\" he said, wiping the tears away. \"Not about _human_ kissing. You must begin to direct your attention to an animal not so meek and drivable. You must learn to consider, my son, that hornless wonder and terror of the world who forever grazes but never ruminates!\"  For years, in talking with a mind too young wholly to understand, he had enjoyed the play of his own mind. He knew only too well that there are few or none with whom a physician may dare have his sportive fling at his fellow-creatures, at life in general. From a listener who never sat in harsh judgment and who would never miscarry his random words, he had upon occasion derived incalculable relief.  \"Anyhow, I have learned that cows have the new American way of chewing; so they never get indigestion, do they?\"  \"If they do, they cannot voice their symptoms in my mummied ears,\" said the doctor, who often seemed to himself to have been listening to hue and cry for medicine since the days of Thotmes. \"However, we won't say anything further about _that_! What else are you going to do over there? This can't possibly be all!\"  \"To-night we children are going to sit up until midnight, to see whether the animals bellow and roar and make all kinds of noise on Christmas Eve. We know they don't, but we're going to _prove_ they don't!\"  \"Where did you pick up that notion?\"  \"Where did you pick it up when you were a boy?\"  \"I fail to remember,\" admitted the doctor with mock dignity, damaged in his logic but recalling the child legend that on the Night of the Nativity universal nature was in sympathy with the miracle. All sentient creatures were wakeful and stirring, and sent forth the chorus of their cries in stables and barns--paying their tribute to the Divine in the Manger and proclaiming their brotherhood with Him who was to bring into the world a new gospel for them also.  \"I don't know where I got that,\" he repeated. \"Well, after the animals bellow and roar and make all kinds of noise, then what?\"  \"There isn't but one thing more; but that is best of all!\"  \"You don't say! Out with it!\"  \"That is our secret.\"  The new decision of tone demonstrated that another stage had been reached in their intercourse. The boy had withdrawn his confidence; he had entered the ranks of his own generation and had taken his confidence with him. Personally, also, he had shut the gate of his mind and the gate was guarded by a will; henceforth it was to be opened by permission of the guard. Something in their lives was abruptly ended; the father felt like ending the talk.  \"Very well, then; we won't say anything more about the secret. And now you had better run along.\"  \"But I don't want to run along just yet. It will be a long time before I see you again; have you thought of that?\"  He reversed his position so as to face the fire; and he crossed his feet out beyond the promontory of the doctor's knees and folded his arms on the rampart of those enfolding arms.  For a few moments there was intimate silence. Then he inquired:--  \"How old must a boy be to ask a girl?\"  A flame more tender and humorous burned in the doctor's eyes.  \"Ask her _what_?\"  \"Ask her nothing! Ask _her_!\"  \"You mean _tell_ her, don't you? Not ask her, my friend and relative; _tell_ her!\"  \"Well, ask her and tell her, too; they go together!\"  \"Is it possible! I'm always glad to learn!\"  \"Then, how old must he be?\"  \"Well, if you stand in need of the opinion of an experienced physician, as soon as he learns to speak would be about the right period! That would be the safest age! The patient would then have leisure to consider his case before being affected by the disease. You could have time to get singed and step away gradually instead of being roasted alive all at once. Does that sound hard?\"  \"Not very! Do you love a girl longer if you tell her or if you don't tell her?\"  \"I'm afraid nobody has ever tried _both_ ways! Suppose you try both, and let us have the benefit of your experience.\"  \"Well, then, if you love, do you love forever?\"  The doctor laughed nervously and tightened his arms around the innocent.  \"Nobody has lived forever yet--nobody knows!\"  \"But forever while you live--do you love as long as that?\"  \"You wouldn't know until you were dead and then it would be too late to report. But aren't you doing a good deal of hard fighting this morning,--on soft-boiled eggs,--though I think the victory is yours, General, the victory is truly and honestly yours!\"  \"I can't stop thinking, can I? You don't expect me to stop thinking, do you, when I'm just beginning really to think?\"  \"Very well, then, we won't say anything more about thinking.\"  \"Then do you or don't you?\"  \"Now, what are you trying to talk about?\" demanded the doctor angrily, and as if on instant guard. A new hatred seemed coming to life in him; there was a burning flash of it in his eyes.  \"Just between ourselves--suppose that when I am a man and after I have been married to Elizabeth awhile, I get tired of her and want a little change. And I fell in love with another"]]]
