They held their tongues, however, and waited with pounding hearts and tingling nerves.  \"An hour or so later,\" Colonel Welsh finally continued, \"an old man came down into the cellar holding a chipped bowl of some steaming liquid. It proved to be a bitter kind of tree root broth, but just the same it tasted mighty good to my agent. He accepted it, and drank it down without a word. Then he took a good look at this man and saw that he wasn't so old after all. He was no older than my agent, but war had made him look three times his true age. My agent's first questions were concerning what had happened to him, and how he had come to be there. My agent, of course, spoke Russian, but it developed that this man with the root broth spoke English, too. The long and short of it was that in the dark my agent had simply stepped down an uncovered, abandoned well. Why he hadn't broken his neck is something that nobody will ever be able to explain. Anyway, this man, who said he was a Russian, and named Ivan Nikolsk, said that he had found my agent at the bottom of the well. And that he was about to shovel dirt in on top of him, thinking him to be a Nazi, when he saw that my agent's clothes were Russian made. So he hoisted my agent up out of the well and took him down into the cellar. And that was that. Nikolsk simply believed that he was saving the life of a brother Russian. And he'd hide him from the Nazis, who were all about, at least until he'd found out more about the man whom he had pulled from the abandoned well.\"  The Colonel paused to shrug slightly, and make a little this-probably-sounds-nuts gesture with one hand.  \"Well, the two of them started talking back and forth, of course,\" he resumed his story presently, \"and my agent learned a few things about his lifesaver. One, that Nikolsk had been born in Moscow but had lived most of his life in Germany. And two, that Nikolsk had almost lost his life in a railroad train wreck just before the invasion of Poland. And three, that--\"  \"Good grief!\" Freddy Farmer interrupted with a gasp. \"The same chap that Agent Jones met!\"  \"One and the same,\" Colonel Welsh admitted with a nod. \"He told my agent how he had been arrested by the Nazis and thrown into prison, where he almost died as the result of his train wreck injuries. But he survived, somehow. He survived the questioning and beatings he received. And, like Jones, he refused to let a Nazi internment camp finish him off for good. He managed to escape almost three years later and make his way out of Germany, and across German-occupied Poland and German-occupied Russia to the little village of Tobolsk. There he hoped to meet a life-long friend. But he never met him. When Nikolsk finally arrived, his friend, and most of the village's inhabitants, had simply disappeared from the face of the earth. But--\"  Colonel Welsh leaned forward slightly and tapped a forefinger on the desk top.  \"Ivan Nikolsk had survived things that you could not even put into words, for there are no words in any language to describe them adequately,\" he said. \"But though he came out of it all with his life, he came out of it with only part of his brain. It didn't take my agent long to see that Nikolsk went off the beam completely every now and then. He would be making sense, when suddenly his speech would start rambling all over the place. And even then, almost a year later, he had the certain belief that his friend would return to Tobolsk, and he would be able to see him.\"  \"Did he tell your agent _why_ he wanted to see his friend?\" Dawson asked eagerly.  \"No,\" Colonel Welsh replied. \"That's one of the questions he wouldn't answer, though my agent asked it more than once as he heard more and more of the strange story. It's funny, but though Nikolsk had saved my agent's life, and believed him definitely on Russia's side, he couldn't get it out of his head that my agent might rob him of his great secret. Yes, you're guessing it. Nikolsk's secret knowledge of the Nazi war plan that he had learned while in Germany. Oddly enough, he told my agent every detail of his meeting with Agent Jones. Of how he had torn the secret information in half, given half to Jones, and destroyed the half that he kept. He told my agent all that, but he wouldn't tell him _one word_ of what the information was about. And do you know _why_?\"  \"Didn't trust your agent, obviously,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up.  \"Yes, that's my guess, too,\" Dawson added.  \"No,\" Colonel Welsh said with a vigorous shake of his head. \"True, he didn't tell my agent what his half of the information was because he was afraid of being betrayed. But he wouldn't reveal anything about the other half--_because he had forgotten it_!\"  \"Forgotten it, for cat's sake!\" Dawson exploded. \"But--?\"  \"Just what I am about to explain,\" Colonel Welsh cut in. \"He swore blind that what he knew was of no use at all without the half that he had given to Jones. And to get it all together he had to see either Jones or his friend. He felt that Jones was dead, but--but he still held to the crazy belief that his friend would return to Tobolsk one day, and that together they would place in Joseph Stalin's hands something more valuable than a hundred armored divisions, or a thousand squadrons of aircraft!\"  As the echo of the last died away, a tingling silence settled over the room. Dawson had the insane urge to pinch himself hard just to make sure he wasn't sleeping through a very cockeyed dream. He knew, and had seen for himself, many of the upside down things that come out of war. But this dizzy tale was a new high for everything. When he tried to mull it over, and gain some sense from it, it simply made his brain hurt.  \"This is certainly something, sir,\" he mumbled, and gave the Colonel a searching look. \"And you are going to say that your agent didn't learn a darn thing, and had to leave it that way? Gosh! I think I would have slung Nikolsk over my shoulder and high-tailed to Moscow as fast as I could, and counted on Joseph Stalin, himself, getting him to talk.\"  \"Don't worry,\" the Colonel said, with a grim, smile, \"my agent thought of that idea, too. But, of course, it was impossible. He even suggested the idea, but Nikolsk would have no part of it. He insisted that what little he might be able to tell Stalin wouldn't help at all. He _had_ to wait for either his friend, or Agent Jones, to turn up. And he was going to park right there in Tobolsk, keeping out of the way of the Nazis, until either of those things happened.\"  \"So I would say,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up as though talking to himself aloud, \"that this friend was the _third_ man who possessed part of the original information. Either that, or Nikolsk had sent another copy of all of it to him, in case something should happen to him. And Jones showing up with a torn half would prove to the friend that Nikolsk was finished. And--\"  \"No doubt the truth of the matter, Farmer,\" Air Vice-Marshal Leman took up the talking. \"This friend was in the know about some of the business, if not all of it, no doubt. But Moscow had received not one single word, which proves what we fear. Namely, that Nikolsk's friend is dead, and will never return to Tobolsk.\"  \"But there is still Agent Jones!\" Dawson cried eagerly.  Colonel Welsh and Air Vice-Marshal Leman exchanged a long look. And it was the R.A.F. Intelligence chief who finally spoke.  \"Yes,\" he said softly. \"There is still Agent Jones.\"     CHAPTER FIVE  _Doubling for Death_   For a long, long minute Dawson waited for Air Vice-Marshal Leman to continue. But the R.A.F. officer seemed to have said his bit, and that was that. He lapsed into silence and stared fixedly down at his hands folded on the desk. Dave started to put the obvious question, but before his lips could form the words Colonel Welsh broke the silence.  \"Yes, there is still Agent Jones,\" he said. \"But it isn't so simple as all that. I mean, it isn't just a question of flying Jones over to Tobolsk and letting him get together with Nikolsk. Ivan Nikolsk has done the disappearing act again. And in addition, we have the very strong hunch that friend Himmler's Gestapo has entered into the picture.\"  \"He's disappeared, sir?\" Freddy Farmer choked out. \"What blasted rotten luck! But isn't there something that can be done? I mean, have you any idea where Nikolsk might be? And--?\"  \"One thing at a time, Farmer,\" Colonel Welsh said with a chuckle, and held up his hand. \"Not so fast, son. The thing's a mess right at the moment, but we have hopes.\"  \"Sorry, sir,\" Farmer said, as the red rushed up his face to the roots of his hair. \"But it was a bit of a let-down after getting all warmed up, you know.\"  \"Well, that's the way with war,\" the American Intelligence chief said with a smile. \"But to get on with my story. Just now I jumped ahead. So I'll go back to my agent in Tobolsk. Well, he stayed there in Nikolsk's cellar for four days. By the end of four days he had all his strength back, and falling down the empty well shaft was just an unpleasant memory. During those four days and nights Nikolsk was constantly with him, for the reason that a lot of Germans moved into the village. And from what Nikolsk could see they were there for some mysterious reason. I mean, they didn't camp, and they didn't have much equipment with them. Fact is, they were mostly Gestapo men in uniform.  \"So for four days and four nights my agent and Nikolsk hugged that cellar and prayed to their gods that the Germans wouldn't stumble over them. And whenever he had the chance, my agent went to work questioning his new found Russian-friend, but, sorry to say, he didn't even get to first base. The instant those Germans showed up Nikolsk closed up like a clam. Matter of fact, my agent says that he was practically blue with fear most of the time. He seemed to think that the Gestapo boys were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41718"],["title","Dave Dawson on the Russian Front (#5)"],["body","him.\"  \"Were they?\" Dawson asked quietly as the other paused.  Colonel Welsh shrugged and dragged down the corners of his mouth.  \"Yes and no,\" he said. \"We don't know anything for certain. The next day Nikolsk left the cellar and didn't return. My agent waited a day longer, and then decided that it was time for him to be moving. He had some tattered peasant clothing that Nikolsk had given him, and he slipped out at night and continued his journey northward. In two days he was on the Russian side of the war. And as luck would have it, he bumped into a tank officer he knew. The rest was easy. A plane took my agent to Moscow. And after a day in Moscow he came on down here to London and reported to me. That was last night. When I heard his story I got in touch with the Air Vice-Marshal here. We went into a huddle, and--well, that brings us up to the present moment.\"  A hundred thousand questions had been leaping around in Dave Dawson's brain. So when the Colonel stopped talking he got the first one out as soon as he could.  \"What about your Gestapo hunch, sir?\" he asked. \"Just how do you mean they've entered the picture? Only because of the Tobolsk business?\"  The American Intelligence chief gave an emphatic shake of his head.  \"No, not that alone,\" he said. \"My agent stated that he was dead certain that he had been followed in Moscow. And that he is being followed right here in London. True, he's taken all kinds of measures to trip up whoever has been shadowing him. But the lad seems to be very clever. My agent can smell him, you might say. He can even feel eyes watching him. But he hasn't yet been able to get a look at this so-called shadow of his. And you can add to that, sir, eh?\"  As Colonel Welsh spoke the last he turned and nodded at Air Vice-Marshal Leman. The R.A.F. officer nodded gravely, and the corners of his mouth tightened slightly.  \"Quite!\" he grunted, and looked at the two youthful air aces. \"The blasted thing is the most incredible mess I've ever bumped up against. Truly fantastic. You'll be sure I've gone balmy when you hear this, but it is the absolute truth. Agent Jones has also been followed ever since he returned! What's more, his flat over on Regent Street has been entered and thoroughly searched at least twice, to his knowledge. And once--though he can't say for sure--a half-hearted attempt to kidnap him was made. At least, he was grabbed during a blackout, and he received a blow on the head that didn't quite stun him. Of course, it might just have been one of those countless blackout accidents. He may have bumped into a couple of skitterish chaps, and they may have got a little bit out of hand. When the blow didn't stun him, and he wrenched himself free, the two other chaps had disappeared. So there's no way of telling whether it was an accident or the real thing.\"  \"But it must have been an accident!\" Dawson spoke up with a frown. \"And after what Jones went through, maybe his imagination is playing him tricks. I mean, maybe he just thinks that he's being followed, and thinks that his place was searched. I--\"  Dawson cut himself off short, and suddenly felt like kicking himself. A funny look had leaped into Air Vice-Marshal Leman's eyes. And there was also a funny expression on Colonel Welsh's face. Dawson had the instant belief that he had spoken out of turn and put his foot into it.  \"You don't agree, sir?\" he asked the R.A.F. officer lamely.  The funny light faded from the other's eyes, and he shook his head.  \"No, I don't agree; Dawson,\" he said quietly. \"True, I realize that it seems silly to think that the Gestapo got wind of Agent Jones, or Nikolsk, or Colonel Welsh's agent. The whole thing covers a period of about three years, but--well, I have to give credit to Himmler's gang of murderers for one thing, at least. They never forget anything. And they never give up the hunt. How they found out about Ivan Nikolsk, and his connection with Agent Jones, and his connection with the Colonel's agent, are three things we'll probably never learn. But the fact remains that the Gestapo has pulled many things out of thin air in times gone by. It is one of the smoothest working and one of the cleverest organizations in the history of man. So we would be plain blasted fools to brush any thought aside as being impossible of accomplishment. No, far better for us to assume that the Gestapo has wind of what's up, and to make our own plans accordingly.\"  \"Check and double check on that, sir,\" Dawson said respectfully. \"And with your permission, I'd like to withdraw that crazy remark I just made.\"  \"Granted at once, Dawson,\" the Air Vice-Marshal said with a pleasant smile. \"Matter of fact, I really don't blame you for making it. Would have done so myself, if I didn't know all the facts.\"  A couple of minutes of silence settled over the room, and then it became too much for Freddy Farmer. He inched forward on the edge of his chair, and looked straight at the Air Vice-Marshal.  \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, \"but may I ask why Dawson and I were ordered to report to you? I mean, is there something we can do to help straighten out the mess? And, if so, I can say for both of us that we're only too eager to try anything.\"  \"Old fire eater Farmer,\" Dawson said with a chuckle. Then, glancing at the Air Vice-Marshal, he added, \"He took the words out of my mouth, sir. I've been wanting to ask that question ever since we came in here.\"  The Chief of R.A.F. Intelligence didn't reply at once. He looked over at Colonel Welsh, and a special kind of look seemed to pass between them. Then finally, the American officer spoke.  \"Yes, we had good reason to send for you two,\" he said. \"And there is a way that you can help--I hope.\"  \"Those last two words don't sound so good, sir,\" Dawson spoke up with a grin. \"You mean, there's nothing definite?\"  \"No, I don't mean that,\" the Colonel replied. \"I mean--\"  The senior officer paused, and scowled heavily as though he were reluctant to let the rest come off his lips.  \"No, I don't mean that,\" he repeated presently. \"You two can help us, and more than you realize at the moment. However--well, to give it to you straight, it might turn out to be a dirty trick on both of you. Your war service might suddenly end with a bang, or worse.\"  Dawson swallowed hard at that remark, but managed to keep a grin on his lips.  \"We've flirted with that kind of a situation a couple of times before, sir,\" he said quietly. \"So maybe Lady Luck wouldn't leave us cold all of a sudden.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy Farmer echoed. \"At least, it wouldn't be anything new and novel to us, if you know what I mean?\"  \"I do,\" Colonel Welsh said with a chuckle. \"But it so happens that this would be a new and novel item. That is, unless you've acted as decoys of the real thing in the past?\"  \"Huh, decoys?\" Dawson gulped. \"How's that again, sir?\"  Colonel Welsh leaned forward and rested his forearms on the end of the desk.  \"Obviously,\" he said, \"the thing we want to do, and as soon as we can, is to get Ivan Nikolsk and Agent Jones together. Though Nikolsk has disappeared for the moment, we feel very strongly that he is not very far from Tobolsk. As my agent stated, his one and only aim in life was to meet his friend, or Agent Jones, at Tobolsk. Therefore there is good reason to believe the Gestapo simply scared him into some other place of hiding, and not too far away. So if Agent Jones should go to Tobolsk, the chances are that he would meet up with Ivan Nikolsk sooner or later. My agent and Agent Jones have checked, and the appearance of Nikolsk hasn't changed much. I mean that Agent Jones is certain that he would recognize him at once. And he is also certain that he can fully establish his identity to Nikolsk.\"  \"And our job is to fly Agent Jones to Tobolsk, and land him safely, eh, sir?\" Freddy Farmer spoke up excitedly.  \"No, definitely not,\" Colonel Welsh replied evenly. \"Your job will be to take the Gestapo boys off the necks of Agent Jones, and get them all wrapped up in the task of chasing you!\"     CHAPTER SIX  _Eagles for Moscow_   Had Colonel Welsh calmly pulled out an automatic and fired the whole clip through the ceiling of Room Twelve Hundred, Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer wouldn't have been half so surprised as they were right at the moment. Like two sitting statues of stone, they froze motionless, and gaped wide-eyed at the Colonel. A billion questions spun around in their brains, but for several seconds neither could have made his lips speak words; not for a million dollars in cold cash.  In time, though, Dawson succeeded in getting his tongue back into working order.  \"Sweet tripe!\" he exploded. \"That is a new one for us! Decoys for the Gestapo rats! Gosh!\"  \"It doesn't meet with your approval, Dawson?\" Air Vice-Marshal Leman put the question with a slight frown.  \"Sure, one hundred per cent, sir,\" Dave came right back at him quickly. \"But it was so sudden like--well, it's sort of got me still swinging at thin air. One right on the outside corner that I didn't even see the pitcher let fly.\"  \"Eh, what?\" the senior R.A.F. officer grunted with a blank look on his face.  \"Another American expression, sir,\" Colonel Welsh explained immediately. \"Dawson means I took the wind out of his sails. Caught him flat-footed off the bag, you might say.\"  \"Oh, yes, quite!\" the English officer murmured, but didn't exactly lose his blank look. \"Well, I'm glad that you approve, because we are definitely counting on you two for help. If this bit of a mission is completely successful, there's no telling how much it may change the course of the war in our favor, you know.\"  \"If it can be done, we'll both do our best to hold up our end, sir,\" Freddy Farmer murmured.  \"And you can say that again for me,\" Dawson added his bit. Then, turning to Colonel Welsh, he asked, \"What's the plan, sir? Or shouldn't I ask that now?\"  \"You should, and I'll answer it,\" the American Intelligence chief replied. \"Here is the picture as we've"]]]
