For, to do so, I must cognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, which—since I cannot support my conception by any intuition—is impossible. At the same time, while I cannot _cognize_, I can quite well _think_ freedom, that is to say, my representation of it involves at least no contradiction, if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two modes of representation (the sensible and the intellectual) and the consequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and of the principles which flow from them. Suppose now that morality necessarily presupposed liberty, in the strictest sense, as a property of our will; suppose that reason contained certain practical, original principles _à priori_, which were absolutely impossible without this presupposition; and suppose, at the same time, that speculative reason had proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all. It would then follow that the moral presupposition must give way to the speculative affirmation, the opposite of which involves an obvious contradiction, and that _liberty_ and, with it, morality must yield to the _mechanism of nature;_ for the negation of morality involves no contradiction, except on the presupposition of liberty. Now morality does not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enough that I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction, that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature. But even this requirement we could not satisfy, if we had not learnt the twofold sense in which things may be taken; and it is only in this way that the doctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are confined within their proper limits. For this result, then, we are indebted to a criticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to things in themselves, and establishes the necessary limitation of our theoretical _cognition_ to mere phenomena.   [7] In order to _cognize_ an object, I must be able to prove its  possibility, either from its reality as attested by experience, or _à  priori_, by means of reason. But I can _think_ what I please, provided  only I do not contradict myself; that is, provided my conception is a  possible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence  of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities. But something  more is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective  validity, that is real possibility—the other possibility being merely  logical. We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of  cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but  may derive them from practical sources.   The positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in relation to the conception of _God_ and of the _simple nature_ of the _soul_, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shall not dwell. I cannot even make the assumption—as the practical interests of morality require—of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight. For to arrive at these, it must make use of principles which, in fact, extend only to the objects of possible experience, and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into phenomena, and thus rendering the _practical extension_ of pure reason impossible. I must, therefore, abolish _knowledge_, to make room for _belief_. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that it is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, is the true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militates against morality.  Thus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to posterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in accordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such a bequest is not to be depreciated. It will render an important service to reason, by substituting the certainty of scientific method for that random groping after results without the guidance of principles, which has hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies. It will render an important service to the inquiring mind of youth, by leading the student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science, instead of wasting them, as at present, on speculations which can never lead to any result, or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and opinions. But, above all, it will confer an inestimable benefit on morality and religion, by showing that all the objections urged against them may be silenced for ever by the _Socratic_ method, that is to say, by proving the ignorance of the objector. For, as the world has never been, and, no doubt, never will be without a system of metaphysics of one kind or another, it is the highest and weightiest concern of philosophy to render it powerless for harm, by closing up the sources of error.  This important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of its fancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does not prove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity. The advantages which the world has derived from the teachings of pure reason are not at all impaired. The loss falls, in its whole extent, on the _monopoly of the schools_, but does not in the slightest degree touch the _interests of mankind_. I appeal to the most obstinate dogmatist, whether the proof of the continued existence of the soul after death, derived from the simplicity of its substance; of the freedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature, drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and objective practical necessity; or of the existence of God, deduced from the conception of an _ens realissimum_—the contingency of the changeable, and the necessity of a prime mover, has ever been able to pass beyond the limits of the schools, to penetrate the public mind, or to exercise the slightest influence on its convictions. It must be admitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to the unfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, it can never be expected to take place. On the contrary, it is plain that _the hope of a future life_ arises from the feeling, which exists in the breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet and satisfy the demands of his nature. In like manner, it cannot be doubted that the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of inclination, gives rise to the consciousness of _freedom_, and that the glorious order, beauty, and providential care, everywhere displayed in nature, give rise to the belief in a wise and great Author of the Universe. Such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind, so far as they depend on rational grounds; and this public property not only remains undisturbed, but is even raised to greater importance, by the doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a more profound insight into a matter of general human concernment than that to which the great mass of men, ever held by us in the highest estimation, can without difficulty attain, and that the schools should, therefore, confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally comprehensible and, from a moral point of view, amply satisfactory proofs. The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions of the schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusive possession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public.   Quod mecum nescit, solus vult scire videri.   At the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his just title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the public without its knowledge—I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason. This can never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; for finespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little impression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought against these truths. On the other hand, since both inevitably force themselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation, it becomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thorough investigation of the rights of speculative reason and, thus, to prevent the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later, to cause even to the masses. It is only by criticism that metaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from these controversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines. Criticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism, fatalism, atheism, free-thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which are universally injurious—as well as of idealism and scepticism, which are dangerous to the schools, but can scarcely pass over to the public. If governments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned, it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of science, as well as for those of society, to favour a criticism of this kind, by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm basis, than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools, which raise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of cobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and the loss of which, therefore, it can never feel.  This critical science is not opposed to the _dogmatic procedure_ of reason in pure cognition; for pure cognition must always be dogmatic, that is, must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles _à priori_—but to _dogmatism_, that is, to the presumption that it is possible to make any progress with a pure cognition, derived from (philosophical) conceptions, according to the principles which reason has long"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4280"],["title","The Critique of Pure Reason (#6)"],["body","in the habit of employing—without first inquiring in what way and by what right reason has come into the possession of these principles. Dogmatism is thus the dogmatic procedure of pure reason _without previous criticism of its own powers_, and in opposing this procedure, we must not be supposed to lend any countenance to that loquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name of popularity, nor yet to scepticism, which makes short work with the whole science of metaphysics. On the contrary, our criticism is the necessary preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysics which must perform its task entirely _à priori_, to the complete satisfaction of speculative reason, and must, therefore, be treated, not popularly, but scholastically. In carrying out the plan which the Critique prescribes, that is, in the future system of metaphysics, we must have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated WOLF, the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers. He was the first to point out the necessity of establishing fixed principles, of clearly defining our conceptions, and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severe scrutiny, instead of rashly jumping at conclusions. The example which he set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thorough investigation which is not yet extinct in Germany. He would have been peculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to metaphysical studies, had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a criticism of the _organum_, that is, of pure reason itself. That he failed to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribed to the dogmatic mode of thought which characterized his age, and on this point the philosophers of his time, as well as of all previous times, have nothing to reproach each other with. Those who reject at once the method of Wolf, and of the Critique of Pure Reason, can have no other aim but to shake off the fetters of _science_, to change labour into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into philodoxy.  In this _second edition_, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to remove the difficulties and obscurity which, without fault of mine perhaps, have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute thinkers. In the propositions themselves, and in the demonstrations by which they are supported, as well as in the form and the entire plan of the work, I have found nothing to alter; which must be attributed partly to the long examination to which I had subjected the whole before offering it to the public and partly to the nature of the case. For pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there is nothing isolated or independent, but every Single part is essential to all the rest; and hence, the slightest imperfection, whether defect or positive error, could not fail to betray itself in use. I venture, further, to hope, that this system will maintain the same unalterable character for the future. I am led to entertain this confidence, not by vanity, but by the evidence which the equality of the result affords, when we proceed, first, from the simplest elements up to the complete whole of pure reason and, and then, backwards from the whole to each part. We find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration, in any part, leads inevitably to contradictions, not merely in this system, but in human reason itself. At the same time, there is still much room for improvement in the _exposition_ of the doctrines contained in this work. In the present edition, I have endeavoured to remove misapprehensions of the æsthetical part, especially with regard to the conception of time; to clear away the obscurity which has been found in the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding; to supply the supposed want of sufficient evidence in the demonstration of the principles of the pure understanding; and, lastly, to obviate the misunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede the Rational Psychology. Beyond this point—the end of the second main division of the “Transcendental Dialectic”—I have not extended my alterations,[8] partly from want of time, and partly because I am not aware that any portion of the remainder has given rise to misconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics, whom I do not here mention with that praise which is their due, but who will find that their suggestions have been attended to in the work itself.   [8] The only addition, properly so called—and that only in the method  of proof—which I have made in the present edition, consists of a new  refutation of psychological _Idealism_, and a strict demonstration—the  only one possible, as I believe—of the objective reality of external  intuition. However harmless idealism may be considered—although in  reality it is not so—in regard to the essential ends of metaphysics,  it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human  reason to be obliged to assume, as an article of mere belief, the  existence of things external to ourselves (from which, yet, we derive  the whole material of cognition for the internal sense), and not to be  able to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in  question. As there is some obscurity of expression in the  demonstration as it stands in the text, I propose to alter the passage  in question as follows: “But this permanent cannot be an intuition in  me. For all the determining grounds of my existence which can be found  in me are representations and, as such, do themselves require a  permanent, distinct from them, which may determine my existence in  relation to their changes, that is, my existence in time, wherein they  change.” It may, probably, be urged in opposition to this proof that,  after all, I am only conscious immediately of that which is in me,  that is, of my _representation_ of external things, and that,  consequently, it must always remain uncertain whether anything  corresponding to this representation does or does not exist externally  to me. But I am conscious, through internal _experience_, of my  _existence in time_ (consequently, also, of the determinability of the  former in the latter), and that is more than the simple consciousness  of my representation. It is, in fact, the same as the _empirical  consciousness of my existence_, which can only be determined in  relation to something, which, while connected with my existence, is  _external to me_. This consciousness of my existence in time is,  therefore, identical with the consciousness of a relation to something  external to me, and it is, therefore, experience, not fiction, sense,  not imagination, which inseparably connects the external with my  internal sense. For the external sense is, in itself, the relation of  intuition to something real, external to me; and the reality of this  something, as opposed to the mere imagination of it, rests solely on  its inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition  of its possibility. If with the _intellectual consciousness_ of my  existence, in the representation: _I am_, which accompanies all my  judgements, and all the operations of my understanding, I could, at  the same time, connect a determination of my existence by  _intellectual intuition_, then the consciousness of a relation to  something external to me would not be necessary. But the internal  intuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though  preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible  and attached to the condition of time. Hence this determination of my  existence, and consequently my internal experience itself, must depend  on something permanent which is not in me, which can be, therefore,  only in something external to me, to which I must look upon myself as  being related. Thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily  connected with that of the internal, in order to the possibility of  experience in general; that is, I am just as certainly conscious that  there are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I  myself exist as determined in time. But in order to ascertain to what  given intuitions objects, external me, really correspond, in other  words, what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to  imagination, I must have recourse, in every particular case, to those  rules according to which experience in general (even internal  experience) is distinguished from imagination, and which are always  based on the proposition that there really is an external  experience.—We may add the remark that the representation of something  _permanent_ in existence, is not the same thing as the _permanent  representation;_ for a representation may be very variable and  changing—as all our representations, even that of matter, are—and yet  refer to something permanent, which must, therefore, be distinct from  all my representations and external to me, the existence of which is  necessarily included in the determination of my own existence, and  with it constitutes _one_ experience—an experience which would not  even be possible internally, if it were not also at the same time, in  part, external. To the question _How?_ we are no more able to reply,  than we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the  coexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of  change.   In attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as possible, I have been compelled to leave out or abridge various passages which were not essential to the completeness of the work, but which many readers might consider useful in other respects, and might be unwilling to miss. This trifling loss, which could not be avoided without swelling the book beyond due limits, may be supplied, at the pleasure of the reader, by a comparison with the first edition, and will, I hope, be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of the exposition as it now stands.
