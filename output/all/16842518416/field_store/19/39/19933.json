Is it some paradox?  —Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.  —What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?  Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:  —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!  —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.  Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.  —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.  —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?  Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.  —It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.  Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.  —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.  Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard. My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird. With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree. So here’s to disciples and Calvary._  He held up a forefinger of warning.  _—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again._  He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead. What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_  He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.  Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:  —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?  —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.  —O, Haines said, you have heard it before?  —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.  —You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.  —There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.  Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.  —Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.  Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.  —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?  —You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.  He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.  —After all, Haines began...  Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.  —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me.  —I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.  —Italian? Haines said.  A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.  —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.  —Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?  —The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.  Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.  —I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.  The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.  Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_  —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.  Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.  —She’s making for Bullock harbour.  The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.  —There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.  The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here I am.  They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.  —Is the brother with you, Malachi?  —Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.  —Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.  —Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.  Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.  Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.  —Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.  —Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.  —Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?  —Yes.  —Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money.  —Is she up the pole?  —Better ask Seymour that.  —Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.  He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:  —Redheaded women buck like goats.  He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.  —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.  He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.  —Are you going in here, Malachi?  —Yes. Make room in the bed.  The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.  —Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.  —Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.  Stephen turned away.  —I’m going, Mulligan, he said.  —Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.  Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.  —And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.  Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.  His plump body plunged.  —We’ll see you again,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300"],["title","Ulysses (#4)"],["body","said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.  Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.  —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.  —Good, Stephen said.  He walked along the upwardcurving path.       Liliata rutilantium.      Turma circumdet.      Iubilantium te virginum.  The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.  A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round.  Usurper.     [ 2 ]   —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?  —Tarentum, sir.  —Very good. Well?  —There was a battle, sir.  —Very good. Where?  The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.  Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?  —I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.  —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.  —Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for._  That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.  —You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?  —End of Pyrrhus, sir?  —I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.  —Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?  A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.  —Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.  All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.  —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.  —A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.  Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.  —Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.  The words troubled their gaze.  —How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.  For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.  Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.  —Tell us a story, sir.  —O, do, sir. A ghoststory.  —Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.  —_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.  —Go on then, Talbot.  —And the story, sir?  —After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.  A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:  _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._  It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.  Talbot repeated:  _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,  Through the dear might..._  —Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.  —What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.  His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms. Ay.       Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.      My father gave me seeds to sow.  Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.  —Have I heard all? Stephen asked.  —Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.  —Half day, sir. Thursday.  —Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.  They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:  —A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.  —O, ask me, sir.  —A hard one, sir.  —This is the riddle, Stephen said:       The cock crew,      The sky was blue:      The bells in heaven      Were striking eleven.      ’Tis time for this poor soul      To go to heaven.  What is that?  —What, sir?  —Again, sir. We didn’t hear.  Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochrane said:  —What is it, sir? We give it up.  Stephen, his throat itching, answered:  —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.  He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.  A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:  —Hockey!  They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.  Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.  He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.  —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.  Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.  —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.  —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.  —Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.  —No, sir.  Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.  Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.  Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.  —Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?  —Yes, sir.  In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.  Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.  The sum was done.  —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.  —Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.  He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook"]]]
