In consequence, the permit to wear my sword and epaulettes and other markings of an officer was not sent to me, and so I could not be allowed to travel by the tramway until I had made known the trouble by telephone and had the permit sent. It was even very difficult for me to be allowed to speak over the telephone. You must see how very hard life is for us officers as things are now.\"  It appears that even the officers going about with the Allied naval sub-commissions were only allowed to wear their designating marks for the occasion, and that, unless a special permit from the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council was shown, these had to be removed as soon as they went ashore. The constant \"self-pity\" which the officers kept showing in the matter of their humiliating predicament was the one thing needed to extinguish the sparks of sympathy which would keep flaring up in one's breast unless one stopped to think how thoroughly deserved--how poetically just--it all was.  With one or two exceptions, all the best of Germany's capital ships were known to have been surrendered, and this applied to light cruisers and destroyers as well. The U-boat situation was somewhat obscure, but it was supposed--incorrectly, as transpired later--that a fairly clean sweep of the best of the under-water craft had also been made. The most interesting ships which the Allied Commission expected to see in German waters were the battleship _Baden_, sister of the surrendered _Bayern_, and the battle-cruiser _Mackensen_, sister of the surrendered _Hindenburg_. The _Regensburg_ and _Königsberg_, which had been left to the Germans to \"get about in,\" were also considered worthy of study at close range as examples of the latest type of German light cruiser. The _Mackensen_, still far from completed, was in a yard on the Elbe at Hamburg. The others were inspected at Wilhelmshaven.  I think I am speaking conservatively when I say that all of the Allied officers who saw them from the inside were distinctly disappointed in even these most modern examples of German naval construction. After the extremely good fight that practically every one of them--from the _Emden_ and _Königsberg_ and the ships of Von Spee's squadron at the Falklands to the battle-cruisers of Von Hipper at Jutland--had put up when it was once drawn into action, it was only natural to expect that some radical departures in construction, armament, and gunnery control would be revealed on closer acquaintance. This did not prove to be the case, though it is only fair to say that, in the matter of gunnery control, there was little opportunity to pass judgment, owing to the fact that, in every instance, the Germans--as they had a perfect right to do--had removed all the instruments and gear calculated to give any indication of the character of the installation.  The German ships were found to be extremely well built, especially in the solidity of construction of their hulls, the fact that they were not intended to be lived in by a full ship's company all of the time making it easy to multiply bulkheads and dispense with doors. But there was nothing new in this fact to those who knew the amount of hammering the _Seydlitz_ and _Derfflinger_ had survived at Dogger Bank and Jutland. Even so, however, there was nothing to indicate that these latest of German ships would stand more punishment than any unit of the Grand Fleet after the stiffening all British capital ships received as a consequence of what was learned at Jutland.  In several respects it was evident that the Germans had merely become tardy converts to British practice. The tripod mast, which dates back something like a decade in British capital ships, and which has, since the war, been built in light cruisers and even destroyer leaders, was only adopted by the Germans with the laying down of the _Bayern_ and _Hindenburg_. Similarly, the armament--both main and secondary--of the respective classes of battleship and battle-cruiser to which these two ships give the name, is a frank admission on the part of the Germans that the British were five years ahead of them in the matter of guns.  Gunnery control, the one thing above all others which the British Navy was interested in when it came to an intimate study of the German ships, is, unfortunately, one of the things upon which the least light has been shed. The German, since he had to disarm, did the job with characteristic Teutonic thoroughness. The transmitting stations in all of the modern ships--the one point where there would have been a great concentration of special instruments of control--looked like unfurnished rooms in their emptiness. So, too, the foretops and what must have been the director towers. One moot point may, however, be regarded as settled. There have been many who maintained that, since the German fire was almost invariably extremely accurate in the opening stages of an action, and tended to fall off rapidly after the ship came under fire herself, the enemy gunnery control involved the use of a very elaborate and highly complicated installation of special instruments, many of which were too delicate to stand the stress of continued action. The British and American officers who went over the latest of the enemy's ships, however, are agreed that all the evidence available points to this not being the case--that the German gunnery control, on the contrary, was undoubtedly as simple as it was efficient, and that the fact that it had not stood up well in action was probably more due to human than mechanical failure.  It is considered as by no means improbable that the good shooting of the German ships was largely traceable to the excellence of their range-finders and the special training of those who used them. Whether it is true or not that France and England have succeeded since the war in making optical glass equal to that of Jena, there is no doubt that the latter was superior in the first years of the war. The German ships unquestionably had more accurate range-finders than did the British, and it is also known now that the Germans took great care in testing the eyesight of the men employed to handle these instruments, and that much attention was given to their training. It is believed that upon these simple points alone, rather than upon the use of a highly complicated system of control, the admitted excellence of German gunnery was based. There is no reason to believe that they had anything better than the British for laying down the \"rate of change,\" and keeping the enemy under fire once he had been straddled.  Although it was known to the British sailor in a general sort of way that the Germans only spent a comparatively small part of their time aboard their ships, the tangible evidence of this remarkable state of affairs--in the vast blocks of barracks at Wilhelmshaven and the very crude, inadequate living quarters in even the most modern of the ships searched--gave him only less of a shock, and aroused in him only less contempt, than did the filth and indiscipline of the German sailors. The German officer who assured one of the searching parties that their ships were made \"to fight in, not to live in,\" told the literal truth, and it only accentuates the bitter irony of the fact that, when finally they refused to fight, they had to begin to be lived in willy-nilly.  \"You can't tell me there isn't a God in Israel, now that we've got the Huns at Scapa living in their own ships,\" said an officer on coming off to the _Hercules_ one night after his first day spent in going over some of the remnants of the German Navy at Wilhelmshaven. That same thought is awakening no end of comfort in the breast of many a British naval officer this winter, who would otherwise have been down on his luck for having still to stand to his guns after the war was over. In a previous chapter I have told how we intercepted a wireless from Admiral Von Reuter, saying that he had \"gone sick\" at Scapa and asking to be relieved. That was not the last by any means that we were to hear of the \"hardships\" of life in those German \"fighting ships\" at good old Scapa. The veritable howls of protest rising from the Orkneys were echoing in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel during all the time the Commission spent in German waters. Some mention of the \"sad plight\" of the German sailors there was made at every conference, and it was at the final one, I believe, that Admiral Goette said that the \"cruel conditions\" under which the men in the interned ships were being compelled to live at Scapa Flow was alone responsible for the fact that it had been so far impossible to find a crew to man the _Baden_, which he had agreed some days previously should be delivered in place of the uncompleted _Mackensen_.  Except for the several modern ships I have mentioned, the search of the naval units remaining in German ports resolved itself into a more or less monotonous clambering over a lot of obsolete hulks--from many of which even the guns had been removed--to see that no munitions remained in their magazines. There was always the same inevitable filth to be waded through, always the same gloweringly sullen--or, worse still by way of variation, cringingly obsequious--officers to be endured. The sullen ones usually improved when they found that no \"indignities\" were to be heaped upon them, and that they had only to answer a few questions and show the way round; but you had to keep a weather eye lifting for the obsequious ones to prevent their helping you up ladders by steadying your elbow, rubbing imaginary spots of grease off your monkey jacket, and--the invariable finale--offering you a limp, moist hand to shake at parting. The latter, like the ruthless U-boat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42374"],["title","To Kiel in the 'Hercules' (#8)"],["body","rfare, was dangerous principally on account of its unexpectedness. When adequate \"counter measures\" were devised against it, it became less threatening, but had always to be looked out for. I don't recall, though, hearing any one confess to having been \"surprised\" into shaking hands after the first day or two.  The search of the warships at Wilhelmshaven was finished in a couple of days, while the few old cruisers and destroyers at Emden were inspected in the three hours between going and returning railway journeys, taking about the same length of time. At Hamburg and Bremen there were principally merchant ships and U-boats, and the search of--and for--both of these is a story of its own. The remainder of the work on the North Sea side consisted in journeys--by train, motor, destroyer, or launch--to, and the inspection of, Germany's principal seaplane and airship stations, and of these highly interesting visits I shall write in later chapters.     III  FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF \"STARVING GERMANY\"   Our visit to the island of Norderney was a memorable one for two reasons--first, because we inspected there what is not only the largest of Germany's seaplane stations, but also probably the largest and best equipped in all Europe; and second, because the journey there gave us, all in the course of a few hours, our first after-the-war glimpse of a German city, German countryside, a German railway, and what had once been a German summer resort. The couple of days spent in the search of the German warships had given no opportunity whatever to see anything more than an interminable succession of dirty mess decks, empty magazines, disgruntled officers, slovenly sailors, and cluttered docks. Steeples and factory chimneys and the loom of lofty barracks located Wilhelmshaven without revealing it. The steady dribble of pedestrians along the waterfront road might have been made up of Esquimaux or Kanakas, for all that we could see. One wondered if their emaciated frames were dressed in paper suits, and if their tottering feet clumped along in wooden clogs. The excellence of the material of the untidy garb of the sailors, and the well-fed appearance of the latter, seemed to point to the contrary. But still one couldn't be sure. We knew that Germany had never made the mistake of under-feeding or under-clothing her soldiers and sailors, and that where any one had to go without it was always the civilians who suffered. We wanted to see how those civilians had stood the \"starvation blockade\" against which they had protested so loudly, and now--through our visits to the various naval air stations--the veil was about to be lifted.  The fog--the interminable fog which never lifted for more than a few hours at a time during the whole of our three weeks in German waters--banked thick above the green stream of the swift-running tide as our picket boat shoved off from the _Hercules_ at eight o'clock that morning, and there was just sufficient visibility to pick up the successive buoys marking the course to the entrance to the basin. Running in just ahead of an antique torpedo-boat with the usual indolent sailors slouching along its narrow decks, we stepped out upon the longest pontoon landing I have ever seen. Twenty yards wide, and over a hundred in length, it was constructed so as to rise and fall with flow and ebb of what must have been a very considerable tide.  No one being on the landing to receive the party, we started walking in toward its shoreward end. The men on the torpedo-boats stared at us with insolent curiosity, without the suggestion of the shuffle of a foot toward standing at attention as even the \"brassiest\" of our several \"brass-hats\" passed by; but from the galley of a tug moored on the opposite side the cook grinned wide-mouthed welcome. She was a fine, upstanding, double-braided blonde of generous proportions, and the bulging bulk of her overflowed the narrow companion-way into which she was wedged as the raw red flesh of her arm swelled over the line of its rolled-up sleeve.  \"No traces of under-feeding in that figure,\" said a British flying officer, with the critically impersonal glance he would have given to the wings of a machine he was about to take the air in. \"No,\" acquiesced one of the Americans; \"and there's no fear of _schrecklichkeit_ in that face, either. Pipe that 'welcome-to-our-fair-city' grin, won't you. Could you beat it for a display of ivories?\"  And so we came to \"starving Germany.\"  A bustling young flying lieutenant came hurrying to meet us at the shore end of the landing, apologizing for his tardiness by saying that it was due to \"trouble about the cars.\" After seeing the motley collection of motors which awaited us outside the gate, one had no difficulty in believing him; indeed, it was hard to see how there could be anything but \"trouble about the cars.\" The best of them was an ancient Mercedes, the pneumatic tyres of which, worn down to the treads, looked as though they would puncture on the smooth face of a paving stone. Two others--one of them looked like a sort of \"perpetuation\" of a collision between a Daimler lorry and a Benz runabout, and the other was an out-and-out mongrel with no visible marks of ancestry--had the remains of what had once been solid tyres of _ersatz_ rubber bound to the rims with bits of tarred rope. The fourth and last was _ersatz_ throughout. That is to say, it seemed to be made--from its paper upholstery to its steel-spring tyres--of \"other things\" than those from which the normal cars one has always known are made of.  I had heard much of those spring tyres, so, taking advantage of the general rush for the pneumatically tyred Mercedes and the \"rheumatically\" tyred nondescripts, I lifted an oiled-paper curtain and plumped down on the woven paper cushion of old \"_Ersatz_.\" As the other cars were quite filled up with the remainder of our party, the escorting German officer came in with me.  \"The imitation rubber,\" he began slowly and precisely, \"makes many good things, but not the good motor tyres. It is resilient, but not elastic. It will stand the pushing but not the pulling. It is not strong, not tough, like the rubber from the tree. Ah, the English were very lucky always to have the real rubber. If that had been so with Germany--\"  Just to what extent a continuous supply of real rubber would have modified the situation for Germany I did not learn, for we started up just then, and the rest of the sentence was lost in the mighty whirl of sound in which we were engulfed. The best comparison I can make of the noise that car made--as heard from within--is to a sustained crescendo of a super-Jazz band, the cymbals of which were represented by the clankity-clank of the component parts of the steel tyres banging against each other and the pavement, and the drums of which were the rhythmic thud-thud of the _ersatz_ body on the lifeless springs. Although the other cars were rattling heavily on their own account, the ear-rending racket of the steel-tyres dominated the situation completely, and at the first turn I caught an impressionistic blend of blue and khaki uniforms as their occupants leaned out to see what was in pursuit of them.  \"It was unlike any sound I ever heard before,\" said one of them in describing it later. \"It was positively Bolshevik!\" All in all, I think \"Bolshevik\" is more fittingly descriptive than \"Jazz-band-ic.\" It carries a suggestion of \"savageness\" quite lacking in the latter, and \"savage\" that raucous tornado of sound surely was. I could never allow myself to contemplate the primal chaos one of the American officers tried to conjure up by asking what it would be like to hear two motor convoys of steel-tyred trucks passing each other during a bombardment. The only sensible comment I heard on that question was from the officer who cut in with, \"Please tell me how you'd know there _was_ a bombardment?\"  There was one thing that steel-tyred car did well, though, and that was to respond to its emergency brake. The occasion for the use of the latter arose when a turning bridge was suddenly opened fifteen or twenty yards ahead of the leading car, imposing upon the latter the necessity of stopping dead inside that distance or taking a header into a canal. The Mercedes, skating airily along on its wobbly tyres, managed it by inches after streaking the pavement with two broad belts of the last \"real tree rubber\" left in Germany. The leading nondescript--the Benz-Daimler blend--gave the Mercedes a sharp bump before losing the last of its momentum, and all but the last of its fluttering \"rope-_ersatz_-rubber\" tyres, while its mate only came to a standstill after skidding sideways on its rims. But my steel-tyred chariot, the instant its emergency brake was thrown on, simply set its teeth into the red brick pavement, and, spitting sparks like a dragon, stopped as dead as though it had run against a stone wall. My companion and I, having nothing to set _our_ teeth into, simply kept going right on. I, luckily, only butted the chauffeur, who--evidently because the same thing had happened to him before--took it all in good part; but the dapper young officer, who planted the back of his head squarely between the shoulder blades of the august Workmen's and Soldiers' representative riding beside the driver, got a good swearing at for not aiming lower and allowing the back of the seat to absorb his inertia. Quite apart from the sparks kicked up by the tyres, and the stars shaken down by my jolt, it was a highly illuminating little incident.  We ran more slowly after we crossed the bridge--which also meant more quietly, or rather, less noisily--and for the first time I noticed what a new world we seemed to have come into since we left the immediate vicinity of the docks. It was not so much that we were now passing down a street of small shops, where before we had been among warehouses and factories, as the difference in appearance and spirit of the people. No one--not "]]]
