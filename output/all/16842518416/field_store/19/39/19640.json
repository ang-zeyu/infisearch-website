He spread his eagle's wings and finding they were strong enough to support his monkey body and lion head he flew swiftly to the tree where he had left Ruggedo.  The Nome was also transformed and was climbing down the tree because the branches all around him were so thickly entwined that there was no room between them to fly.  Kiki quickly joined his comrade and it did not take them long to reach the ground.     8.  The Li-Mon-Eags Make Trouble   There had been trouble in the Forest of Gugu that morning.  Chipo the Wild Boar had bitten the tail off Arx the Giraffe while the latter had his head among the leaves of a tree, eating his breakfast.  Arx kicked with his heels and struck Tirrip, the great Kangaroo, who had a new baby in her pouch.  Tirrip knew it was the Wild Boar's fault, so she knocked him over with one powerful blow and then ran away to escape Chipo's sharp tusks.  In the chase that followed a giant porcupine stuck fifty sharp quills into the Boar and a chimpanzee in a tree threw a cocoanut at the porcupine that jammed its head into its body.  All this was against the Laws of the Forest, and when the excitement was over, Gugu the Leopard King called his royal Counselors together to decide how best to punish the offenders.  The four lords of the forest were holding solemn council in a small clearing when they saw two strange beasts approaching them--beasts the like of which they had never seen before.  Not one of the four, however, relaxed his dignity or showed by a movement that he was startled.  The great Leopard crouched at full length upon a fallen tree-trunk.  Bru the Bear sat on his haunches before the King; Rango the Gray Ape stood with his muscular arms folded, and Loo the Unicorn reclined, much as a horse does, between his fellow-councillors.  With one consent they remained silent, eyeing with steadfast looks the intruders, who were making their way into their forest domain.  \"Well met, Brothers!\" said one of the strange beasts, coming to a halt beside the group, while his comrade with hesitation lagged behind.  \"We are not brothers,\" returned the Gray Ape, sternly.  \"Who are you, and how came you in the forest of Gugu?\"  \"We are two Li-Mon-Eags,\" said Ruggedo, inventing the name.  \"Our home is in Sky Island, and we have come to earth to warn the forest beasts that the people of Oz are about to make war upon them and enslave them, so that they will become beasts of burden forever after and obey only the will of their two-legged masters.\"  A low roar of anger arose from the Council of Beasts.  \"WHO'S going to do that?\" asked Loo the Unicorn, in a high, squeaky voice, at the same time rising to his feet.  \"The people of Oz,\" said Ruggedo.  \"But what will WE be doing?\" inquired the Unicorn.  \"That's what I've come to talk to you about.\"  \"You needn't talk!  We'll fight the Oz people!\" screamed the Unicorn. \"We'll smash 'em; we'll trample 'em; we'll gore 'em; we'll--\"  \"Silence!\" growled Gugu the King, and Loo obeyed, although still trembling with wrath.  The cold, steady gaze of the Leopard wandered over the two strange beasts.  \"The people of Oz,\" said he, \"have not been our friends; they have not been our enemies.  They have let us alone, and we have let them alone.  There is no reason for war between us.  They have no slaves.  They could not use us as slaves if they should conquer us.  I think you are telling us lies, you strange Li-Mon-Eag--you mixed-up beast who are neither one thing nor another.\"  \"Oh, on my word, it's the truth!\" protested the Nome in the beast's shape.  \"I wouldn't lie for the world; I--\"  \"Silence!\" again growled Gugu the King; and somehow, even Ruggedo was abashed and obeyed the edict.  \"What do you say, Bru?\" asked the King, turning to the great Bear, who had until now said nothing.  \"How does the Mixed Beast know that what he says is true?\" asked the Bear.  \"Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an Eagle,\" explained the Nome.  \"I and my comrade yonder,\" turning to Kiki, \"flew to a grove in Oz, and there we heard the people telling how they will make many ropes to snare you beasts, and then they will surround this forest, and all other forests, and make you prisoners.  So we came here to warn you, for being beasts ourselves, although we live in the sky, we are your friends.\"  The Leopard's lip curled and showed his enormous teeth, sharp as needles.  He turned to the Gray Ape.  \"What do YOU think, Rango?\" he asked.  \"Send these mixed beasts away, Your Majesty,\" replied the Gray Ape. \"They are mischief-makers.\"  \"Don't do that--don't do that!\" cried the Unicorn, nervously.  \"The stranger said he would tell us what to do.  Let him tell us, then.  Are we fools, not to heed a warning?\"  Gugu the King turned to Ruggedo.  \"Speak, Stranger,\" he commanded.  \"Well,\" said the Nome, \"it's this way: The Land of Oz is a fine country.  The people of Oz have many good things--houses with soft beds, all sorts of nice-tasting food, pretty clothes, lovely jewels, and many other things that beasts know nothing of.  Here in the dark forests the poor beasts have hard work to get enough to eat and to find a bed to rest in.  But the beasts are better than the people, and why should they not have all the good things the people have?  So I propose that before the Oz people have the time to make all those ropes to snare you with, that all we beasts get together and march against the Oz people and capture them.  Then the beasts will become the masters and the people their slaves.\"  \"What good would that do us?\" asked Bru the Bear.  \"It would save you from slavery, for one thing, and you could enjoy all the fine things of Oz people have.\"  \"Beasts wouldn't know what to do with the things people use,\" said the Gray Ape.  \"But this is only part of my plan,\" insisted the Nome.  \"Listen to the rest of it.  We two Li-Mon-Eags are powerful magicians.  When you have conquered the Oz people we will transform them all into beasts, and send them to the forests to live, and we will transform all the beasts into people, so they can enjoy all the wonderful delights of the Emerald City.\"  For a moment no beast spoke.  Then the King said: \"Prove it.\"  \"Prove what?\" asked Ruggedo.  \"Prove that you can transform us.  If you are a magician transform the Unicorn into a man.  Then we will believe you.  If you fail, we will destroy you.\"  \"All right,\" said the Nome.  \"But I'm tired, so I'll let my comrade make the transformation.\"  Kiki Aru had stood back from the circle, but he had heard all that was said.  He now realized that he must make good Ruggedo's boast, so he retreated to the edge of the clearing and whispered the magic word.  Instantly the Unicorn became a fat, chubby little man, dressed in the purple Gillikin costume, and it was hard to tell which was the more astonished, the King, the Bear, the Ape or the former Unicorn.  \"It's true!\" shorted the man-beast.  \"Good gracious, look what I am! It's wonderful!\"  The King of Beasts now addressed Ruggedo in a more friendly tone.  \"We must believe your story, since you have given us proof of your power,\" said he.  \"But why, if you are so great a magician, cannot you conquer the Oz people without our help, and so save us the trouble?\"  \"Alas!\" replied the crafty old Nome, \"no magician is able to do everything.  The transformations are easy to us because we are Li-Mon-Eags, but we cannot fight, or conquer even such weak creatures as the Oz people.  But we will stay with you and advise and help you, and we will transform all the Oz people into beasts, when the time comes, and all the beasts into people.\"  Gugu the King turned to his Counselors.  \"How shall we answer this friendly stranger?\" he asked.  Loo the former Unicorn was dancing around and cutting capers like a clown.  \"On my word, your Majesty,\" he said, \"this being a man is more fun than being a Unicorn.\"  \"You look like a fool,\" said the Gray Ape.  \"Well, I FEEL fine!\" declared the man-beast.  \"I think I prefer to be a Bear,\" said Big Bru.  \"I was born a Bear, and I know a Bear's ways.  So I am satisfied to live as a Bear lives.\"  \"That,\" said the old Nome, \"is because you know nothing better.  When we have conquered the Oz people, and you become a man, you'll be glad of it.\"  The immense Leopard rested his chin on the log and seemed thoughtful.  \"The beasts of the forest must decide this matter for themselves,\" he said.  \"Go you, Rango the Gray Ape, and tell your monkey tribe to order all the forest beasts to assemble in the Great Clearing at sunrise to-morrow.  When all are gathered together, this mixed-up Beast who is a magician shall talk to them and tell them what he has told us.  Then, if they decide to fight the Oz people, who have declared war on us, I will lead the beasts to battle.\"  Rango the Gray Ape turned at once and glided swiftly through the forest on his mission.  The Bear gave a grunt and walked away.  Gugu the King rose and stretched himself.  Then he said to Ruggedo: \"Meet us at sunrise to-morrow,\" and with stately stride vanished among the trees.  The man-unicorn, left alone with the strangers, suddenly stopped his foolish prancing.  \"You'd better make me a Unicorn again,\" he said.  \"I like being a man, but the forest beasts won't know I'm their friend, Loo, and they might tear me in pieces before morning.\"  So Kiki changed him back to his former shape, and the Unicorn departed to join his people.  Ruggedo the Nome was much pleased with his success.  \"To-morrow,\" he said to Kiki Aru, \"we'll win over these beasts and set them to fight and conquer the Oz people.  Then I will have my revenge"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],["title","The Magic of Oz (#7)"],["body","Ozma and Dorothy and all the rest of my enemies.\"  \"But I am doing all the work,\" said Kiki.  \"Never mind; you're going to be King of Oz,\" promised Ruggedo.  \"Will the big Leopard let me be King?\" asked the boy anxiously.  The Nome came close to him and whispered:  \"If Gugu the Leopard opposes us, you will transform him into a tree, and then he will be helpless.\"  \"Of course,\" agreed Kiki, and he said to himself: \"I shall also transform this deceitful Nome into a tree, for he lies and I cannot trust him.\"     9.  The Isle of the Magic Flower   The Glass Cat was a good guide and led Trot and Cap'n Bill by straight and easy paths through all the settled part of the Munchkin Country, and then into the north section where there were few houses, and finally through a wild country where there were no houses or paths at all.  But the walking was not difficult and at last they came to the edge of a forest and stopped there to make camp and sleep until morning.  From branches of trees Cap'n Bill made a tiny house that was just big enough for the little girl to crawl into and lie down.  But first they ate some of the food Trot had carried in the basket.  \"Don't you want some, too?\" she asked the Glass Cat.  \"No,\" answered the creature.  \"I suppose you'll hunt around an' catch a mouse,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.  \"Me?  Catch a mouse!  Why should I do that?\" inquired the Glass Cat.  \"Why, then you could eat it,\" said the sailor-man.  \"I beg to inform you,\" returned the crystal tabby, \"that I do not eat mice.  Being transparent, so anyone can see through me, I'd look nice, wouldn't I, with a common mouse inside me?  But the fact is that I haven't any stomach or other machinery that would permit me to eat things.  The careless magician who made me didn't think I'd need to eat, I suppose.\"  \"Don't you ever get hungry or thirsty?\" asked Trot.  \"Never.  I don't complain, you know, at the way I'm made, for I've never yet seen any living thing as beautiful as I am.  I have the handsomest brains in the world.  They're pink, and you can see 'em work.\"  \"I wonder,\" said Trot thoughtfully, as she ate her bread and jam, \"if MY brains whirl around in the same way yours do.\"  \"No; not the same way, surely,\" returned the Glass Cat; \"for, in that case, they'd be as good as MY brains, except that they're hidden under a thick, boney skull.\"  \"Brains,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"is of all kinds and work different ways.  But I've noticed that them as thinks that their brains is best is often mistook.\"  Trot was a little disturbed by sounds from the forest, that night, for many beasts seemed prowling among the trees, but she was confident Cap'n Bill would protect her from harm.  And in fact, no beast ventured from the forest to attack them.  At daybreak they were up again, and after a simple breakfast Cap'n Bill said to the Glass Cat:  \"Up anchor, Mate, and let's forge ahead.  I don't suppose we're far from that Magic Flower, are we?\"  \"Not far,\" answered the transparent one, as it led the way into the forest, \"but it may take you some time to get to it.\"  Before long they reached the bank of a river.  It was not very wide, at this place, but as they followed the banks in a northerly direction it gradually broadened.  Suddenly the blue-green leaves of the trees changed to a purple hue, and Trot noticed this and said:  \"I wonder what made the colors change like that?\"  \"It's because we have left the Munchkin Country and entered the Gillikin Country,\" explained the Glass Cat.  \"Also it's a sign our journey is nearly ended.\"  The river made a sudden turn, and after the travelers had passed around the bend, they saw that the stream had now become as broad as a small lake, and in the center of the Lake they beheld a little island, not more than fifty feet in extent, either way.  Something glittered in the middle of this tiny island, and the Glass Cat paused on the bank and said:  \"There is the gold flower-pot containing the Magic Flower, which is very curious and beautiful.  If you can get to the island, your task is ended--except to carry the thing home with you.\"  Cap'n Bill looked at the broad expanse of water and began to whistle a low, quavering tune.  Trot knew that the whistle meant that Cap'n Bill was thinking, and the old sailor didn't look at the island as much as he looked at the trees upon the bank where they stood.  Presently he took from the big pocket of his coat an axe-blade, wound in an old cloth to keep the sharp edge from cutting his clothing.  Then, with a large pocket knife, he cut a small limb from a tree and whittled it into a handle for his axe.  \"Sit down, Trot,\" he advised the girl, as he worked.  \"I've got quite a job ahead of me now, for I've got to build us a raft.\"  \"What do we need a raft for, Cap'n?\"  \"Why, to take us to the island.  We can't walk under water, in the river bed, as the Glass Cat did, so we must float atop the water.\"  \"Can you make a raft, Cap'n Bill?\"  \"O' course, Trot, if you give me time.\"  The little girl sat down on a log and gazed at the Island of the Magic Flower.  Nothing else seemed to grow on the tiny isle.  There was no tree, no shrub, no grass, even, as far as she could make out from that distance.  But the gold pot glittered in the rays of the sun, and Trot could catch glimpses of glowing colors above it, as the Magic Flower changed from one sort to another.  \"When I was here before,\" remarked the Glass Cat, lazily reclining at the girl's feet, \"I saw two Kalidahs on this very bank, where they had come to drink.\"  \"What are Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.  \"The most powerful and ferocious beasts in all Oz.  This forest is their especial home, and so there are few other beasts to be found except monkeys.  The monkeys are spry enough to keep out of the way of the fierce Kalidahs, which attack all other animals and often fight among themselves.\"  \"Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?\" asked Trot, getting very much excited.  \"Yes.  They sprang upon me in an instant; but I lay flat on the ground, so I wouldn't get my legs broken by the great weight of the beasts, and when they tried to bite me I laughed at them and jeered them until they were frantic with rage, for they nearly broke their teeth on my hard glass.  So, after a time, they discovered they could not hurt me, and went away.  It was great fun.\"  \"I hope they don't come here again to drink,--not while we're here, anyhow,\" returned the girl, \"for I'm not made of glass, nor is Cap'n Bill, and if those bad beasts bit us, we'd get hurt.\"  Cap'n Bill was cutting from the trees some long stakes, making them sharp at one end and leaving a crotch at the other end.  These were to bind the logs of his raft together.  He had fashioned several and was just finishing another when the Glass Cat cried: \"Look out!  There's a Kalidah coming toward us.\"  Trot jumped up, greatly frightened, and looked at the terrible animal as if fascinated by its fierce eyes, for the Kalidah was looking at her, too, and its look wasn't at all friendly.  But Cap'n Bill called to her: \"Wade into the river, Trot, up to your knees--an' stay there!\" and she obeyed him at once.  The sailor-man hobbled forward, the stake in one hand and his axe in the other, and got between the girl and the beast, which sprang upon him with a growl of defiance.  Cap'n Bill moved pretty slowly, sometimes, but now he was quick as could be.  As the Kalidah sprang toward him he stuck out his wooden leg and the point of it struck the beast between the eyes and sent it rolling upon the ground.  Before it could get upon its feet again the sailor pushed the sharp stake right through its body and then with the flat side of the axe he hammered the stake as far into the ground as it would go.  By this means he captured the great beast and made it harmless, for try as it would, it could not get away from the stake that held it.  Cap'n Bill knew he could not kill the Kalidah, for no living thing in Oz can be killed, so he stood back and watched the beast wriggle and growl and paw the earth with its sharp claws, and then, satisfied it could not escape, he told Trot to come out of the water again and dry her wet shoes and stockings in the sun.  \"Are you sure he can't get away?\" she asked.  \"I'd bet a cookie on it,\" said Cap'n Bill, so Trot came ashore and took off her shoes and stockings and laid them on the log to dry, while the sailor-man resumed his work on the raft.  The Kalidah, realizing after many struggles that it could not escape, now became quiet, but it said in a harsh, snarling voice:  \"I suppose you think you're clever, to pin me to the ground in this manner.  But when my friends, the other Kalidahs, come here, they'll tear you to pieces for treating me this way.\"  \"P'raps,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, coolly, as he chopped at the logs, \"an' p'raps not.  When are your folks comin' here?\"  \"I don't know,\" admitted the Kalidah.  \"But when they DO come, you can't escape them.\"  \"If they hold off long enough, I'll have my raft ready,\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"What are you going to do with a raft?\" inquired the beast.  \"We're goin' over to that island, to get the Magic Flower.\"  The huge beast looked at him in surprise a moment, and then it began to laugh.  The laugh was a good deal like a roar, and it had a cruel and derisive sound, but it was a laugh nevertheless.  \"Good!\" said the Kalidah.  \"Good!  Very good!  I'm glad you're going to get the Magic Flower.  But what will you do with it?\"  \"We're going to take it to Ozma, as a present on her birthday.\"  The Kalidah laughed again; then it became sober.  \"If you get to the land on your raft before my people can catch you,\" it said, \"you will be safe from us.  We can swim like ducks, so the girl couldn't have escaped me by getting into the water; but Kalidahs don't go to that island over there.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Trot.  The beast was silent.  \"Tell us the reason,\" urged Cap'n Bill.  \"Well, it's the Isle of the Magic Flower,\" answered the Kalidah, \"and we don't care"]]]
