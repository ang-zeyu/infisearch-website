V   Max Wyman shoved his way through such a roar of voices and such a crush of bodies as he had never known before. Scratch Sheet Square was bright as day--brighter. Atomic lamps, mounted on hundred-story buildings hosed and squirted the happy mob with blue-white glare. The Scratch Sheet's moving sign was saying in fiery letters seventy-five feet tall: \"_11:58 PM EST ... December 31st ... Cops say two million jam NYC streets to greet New Year ... 11:59 PM EST ... December 31st ... Falcaro jokes on TV 'Never thought we'd make it' ... 12:00 midnight January 1st ... Happy New Year ..._\"  The roar of voices had become insane. Max Wyman held his head, hating it, hating them all, trying to shut them out. Half a dozen young men against whom he was jammed were tearing the clothes off a girl. They were laughing and she was too, making only a pretense of defending herself. It was one of New York's mild winter nights. Wyman looked at the white skin not knowing that his eyes gloated. He yelled curses at her, and the young men. But nobody heard his whiskey-hoarsened young voice.  Somebody thrust a bottle at him and made mouths, trying to yell: \"Happy New Year!\" He grabbed feverishly at the bottle and held it to his mouth, letting the liquor gurgle once, twice, three times. Then the bottle was snatched away, not by the man who had passed it to him. A hilarious fat woman plastered herself against Wyman and kissed him clingingly on the mouth, to his horror and disgust. She was torn away from him by a laughing, white-haired man and turned willingly to kissing him instead.  Two strapping girls jockeyed Wyman between them and began to tear _his_ clothes off, laughing at their switcheroo on the year's big gag. He clawed out at them hysterically and they stopped, the laughter dying on their lips as they saw his look of terrified rage. A sudden current in the crowd parted Wyman from them; another bottle bobbed on the sea of humanity. He clutched at it and this time did not drink. He stuffed it hurriedly under the waistband of his shorts and kept a hand on it as the eddy of humanity bore him on to the fringes of the roaring mob.  \"_Syndic leaders hail New Year ... Taylor praises Century of Freedom ... 12:05 AM EST January 1st ..._\"  Wyman was mashed up against a girl who first smiled at his young face invitingly ... and then looked again. \"Get away from me!\" she shrieked, pounding on his chest with her small fists. You could hear individual voices now, but the crowd was still dense. She kept screaming at him and hitting him until suddenly Scratch Sheet Square Upramp loomed and the crowd fizzed onto it like uncorked champagne, Wyman and the screaming girl carried along the moving plates underfoot. The crowd boiled onto the northbound strip, relieving the crush; the girl vanished, whimpering, into the mob.  Wyman, rubbing his ear mechanically, shuffled with downcast eyes to the Eastbound ramp and collapsed onto a bench gliding by at five miles per hour. He looked stupidly at the ten-mile and fifteen-mile strips, but did not dare step onto them. He had been drinking steadily for a month. He would fall and the bottle would break.  He lurched off the five-mile strip at Riverside Downramp. Nobody got off with him. Riverside was a tangle of freightways over, under and on the surface. He worked there.  Wyman picked his way past throbbing conveyors roofed against pilferage, under gurgling fuel and water and waste pipes, around vast metal warehouses and storage tanks. It was not dark or idle in Riverside. Twenty-four hours was little enough time to bring Manhattan its daily needs and carry off its daily waste and manufactures. Under daylight atomics the transport engineers in their glass perches read the dials and turned the switches. Breakdown crews scurried out from emergency stations as bells clanged to replace a sagging plate, remag a failing ehrenhafter, unplug a jam of nylon bales at a too-sharp corner.  He found Breakdown Station 26, hitched his jacket over the bottle and swayed in, drunk enough to think he could pretend he was sober. \"Hi,\" he said hoarsely to the shift foreman. \"Got jammed up in the celebration.\"  \"We heard it clear over here,\" the foreman said, looking at him closely. \"Are you all right, Max?\"  The question enraged him. \"'Smatter?\" he yelled. \"Had a couple, sure. Think 'm drunk? Tha' wha' ya think?\"  \"Gee,\" the foreman said wearily. \"Look, Max, I can't send you out tonight. You might get killed. I'm trying to be reasonable and I wish you'd do as much for me. What's biting you, boy? Nobody has anything against a few drinks and a few laughs. I went on a bender last month myself. But you get so Goddammed _mean_ I can't stand you and neither can anybody else.\"  Wyman spewed obscenity at him and tried to swing on him. He was surprised and filled with self-pity when somebody caught his arm and somebody else caught his other arm. It was Dooley and Weintraub, his shift-mates, looking unhappy and concerned.  \"Lousy rats!\" Wyman choked out. \"Leas' a man's buddies c'd do is back'm up....\" He began to cry, hating them, and then fell asleep on his feet. Dooley and Weintraub eased him down onto the floor.  The foreman mopped his head and appealed to Dooley: \"He always like this?\" He had been transferred to Station 26 only two weeks before.  Dooley shrugged. \"You might say so. He showed up about three months ago. Said he used to be a breakdown man in Buffalo, on the yards. He knew the work all right. But I never saw such a mean kid. Never a good word for anybody. Never any fun. Booze, booze, booze. This time he really let go.\"  Weintraub said unexpectedly: \"I think he's what they used to call an alcoholic.\"  \"What the hell's that?\" the foreman demanded.  \"I read about it. It's something they used to have before the Syndic. I read about it. Things were a lot different then. People picking on you all the time, everybody mad all the time. The girls were scared to give it away and the boys were scared to take it--but they did anyway and it was kind of like fighting with yourself _inside_ yourself. The fighting wore some people out so much they just couldn't take it any more. Instead of going on benders for a change of pace like sensible people, they boozed _all_ the time--and they had a fight inside themselves about _that_ so they boozed harder.\" He looked defensive at their skeptical faces. \"I _read_ it,\" he insisted.  \"Well,\" the foreman said inconclusively, \"I heard things used to be pretty bad. Did these alcoholers get over it?\"  \"I don't know,\" Weintraub admitted. \"I didn't read that far.\"  \"Hm. I think I'd better can him.\" The foreman was studying their faces covertly, hoping to read a reaction. He did. Both the men looked relieved. \"Yeh. I think I'd better can him. He can go to the Syndic for relief if he has to. He doesn't do us much good here. Put some soup on and get it down him when he wakes up.\" The foreman, an average kindly man, hoped the soup would help.  But at about three-thirty, after two trouble calls in succession, they noticed that Wyman had left leaving no word.         *       *       *       *       *  The fat little man struggled out of the New Year's eve throng; he had been caught by accident. Commander Grinnel did not go in for celebrations. When he realized that January fifteenth was now fifteen days away, he doubted that he would ever celebrate again. It was a two-man job he had to do on the fifteenth, and so far he had not found the other man.  He rode the slidewalk to Columbus Square. He had been supplied with a minimum list of contacts. One had moved, and in the crazily undisciplined Syndic Territory it was impossible to trace anybody. Another had died--of too much morphine. Another had beaten her husband almost to death with a chair leg and was in custody awaiting trial. The Commander wondered briefly and querulously: why do we always have such unstable people here? Or does that louse Emory deliberately saddle me with them when I'm on a mission? Wouldn't put it past him.  The final contact on the list was a woman. She'd be worthless for the business of January fifteenth; that called for some physical strength, some technical knowledge, and a residual usefulness to the Government. Professor Speiser had done some good work here on industrial sabotage, but taken away from the scene of possible operations, she'd just be a millstone. He had his record to think of.  Sabotage--  If a giggling threesome hadn't been looking his way from a bench across the slidewalk, he would have ground his teeth. In recent weeks, he had done what he estimated as an easy three million dollars worth of damage to Mob Territory industry. And the stupid fools hadn't _noticed_ it! Repair crews had rebuilt the fallen walls, mechanics had tut-tutted over the wrecked engines and replaced them, troubleshooters had troubleshot the scores of severed communications lines and fuel mains.  He had hung around.  \"Sam, you see this? Melted through, like with a little thermite bomb. How in the hell did a thing like that happen?\"  \"I don't know. I wasn't here. Let's get it fixed kid.\"  \"Okay ... you think we ought to report this to somebody?\"  \"If you want to. I'll mention it to Larry. But I don't see what he can do about it. Must've been some kids. You gotta put it down as fair wear and tear. But boys will be boys.\"  Remembering, he did grind his teeth. But they were at Columbus Square.         *       *       *       *       *  Professor Speiser lived in one of the old plastic brick faculty houses. Her horsy face, under a curling net, looked out of the annunciator plate. \"Yes? What is it?\"  \"Professor Speiser, I believe you know my daughter, Miss _Freeman_. She asked me to look you up while I was in New York. Have I come much too late?\"  \"Oh, dear. Why, no. I suppose not. Come in, Mr.--Mr. Freeman.\"  In her parlor, she faced him apprehensively. When"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41714"],["title","The Syndic (#7)"],["body","spoke she rolled out her sentences like the lecturer she was. \"Mr. Freeman--as I suppose you'd prefer me to call you--you asked a moment ago whether you'd come too late. I realize that the question was window-dressing, but my answer is quite serious. You have come too late. I have decided to dissociate myself from--let us say, from your daughter, Miss Freeman.\"  The Commander asked only: \"Is that irrevocable?\"  \"Quite. It wouldn't be fair of me to ask you to leave without an explanation. I am perfectly willing to give one. I realize now that my friendship with Miss Freeman and the work I did for her stemmed from, let us say a certain vacancy in my life.\"  He looked at a picture on her desk of a bald, pleasant-faced fellow with a pipe.  She followed his eyes and said with a sort of shy pride: \"That is Dr. Mordecai, of the University's Faculty of Dentistry. Like myself, a long-time celibate. We plan to marry.\"  The Commander said: \"Do you feel that Dr. Mordecai might like to meet my daughter?\"  \"No. I do not. We expect to have very little time for outside activities, between our professional careers and our personal lives. Please don't misunderstand, Mr. Freeman. I am still your daughter's friend. I always shall be. But somehow I no longer find in myself an urgency to express the friendship. It seems like a beautiful dream--and a quite futile one. I have come to realize that one can live a full life without Miss Freeman. Now, it's getting quite late--\"  He smiled ruefully and rose. \"May I wish you every happiness, Professor Speiser?\" he said, extending his hand.  She beamed with relief. \"I was so afraid you'd--\"  Her face went limp and she stood swaying drunkenly as the needle in the ring popped her skin.  The Commander, his face as dead as hers, disconnected his hand and sheathed the needle carefully again. He drew one of his guns, shot her through the heart and walked out of the apartment.  Old fool! She should have known better.         *       *       *       *       *  Max Wyman stumbled through the tangle of Riveredge, his head a pot of molten lead and his legs twitching under him as he fled from his shame.  Dimly, as if with new eyes, he saw that he was not alone. Riveredge was technically uninhabited. Then what voices called guardedly to him from the shadows: \"Buddy--buddy--wait up a minute, buddy--did you score? Did you score?\"  He lurched on and the voices became bolder. The snaking conveyors and ramps sliced out sectors of space. Storage tanks merged with inflow mains to form sheltered spots where they met. No spot was without its whining, appealing voice. He stood at last, quivering, leaning against a gigantic I-beam that supported a heavy-casting freightway. A scrap sheet of corrugated iron rested against the bay of the I-beam, and the sheet quivered and fell outward. An old man's voice said: \"You're beat, son. Come on in.\"  He staggered a step forward and collapsed on a pallet of rags as somebody carefully leaned the sheet back into place again.     VI   Max Wyman woke raving with the chuck horrors. There was somebody there to hand him candy bars, sweet lemonade, lump sugar. There was somebody to shove him easily back into the pallet of rags when he tried to stumble forth in a hunt for booze. On the second day he realized that it was an old man whose face looked gray and paralyzed. His name was T. G. Pendelton, he said.  After a week, he let Max Wyman take little walks about their part of Riverside--but not by night. \"We've got some savage people here,\" he said. \"They'd murder you for a pint. The women are worse. If one calls to you, don't go. You'll wind up dumped through a manhole into the Hudson. Poor folk.\"  \"You're _sorry_ for them?\" Wyman asked, startled. It was a new idea to him. Since Buffalo, he had never been sorry for anybody. Something awful had happened there, some terrible betrayal ... he passed his bony hand across his forehead. He didn't want to think about it.  \"Would I live here if I weren't?\" T. G. asked him. \"Sometimes I can help them. There's nobody else to help them. They're old and sick and they don't fit anywhere. That's why they're savage. You're young--the only young man I've ever seen in Riveredge. There's so much outside for the young. But when you get old it sometimes throws you.\"  \"The Goddammed Syndic,\" Wyman snarled, full of hate.  T. G. shrugged. \"Maybe it's too easy for sick old people to get booze. They lose somebody they spent a life with and it throws them. People harden into a pattern. They always had fun, they think they always will. Then half of the pattern's gone and they can't stand it, some of them. You got it early. What was the ringing bell?\"  Wyman collapsed into the bay of the I-beam as if he'd been kicked in the stomach. A wave of intolerable memory swept over him. A ringing bell, a wobbling pendulum, a flashing light, the fair face of his betrayer, the hateful one of Hogan, stirred together in a hell brew. \"Nothing,\" he said hoarsely, thinking that he'd give his life for enough booze to black him out. \"Nothing.\"  \"You kept talking about it,\" T. G. said. \"Was it real?\"  \"It couldn't have been,\" Wyman muttered. \"There aren't such things. No. There was her and that Syndic and that louse Hogan. I don't want to talk about it.\"  \"Suit yourself.\"  He did talk about it later, curiously clouded though it was. The years in Buffalo. The violent love affair with Inge. The catastrophic scene when he found her with Regan, king-pin mobster. The way he felt turned inside-out, the lifetime of faith in the Syndic behind him and the lifetime of a faith in Inge ahead of him, both wrecked, the booze, the flight from Buffalo to Erie, to Pittsburgh, to Tampa, to New York. And somehow, insistently, the ringing bell, the wobbling pendulum and the flashing light that kept intruding between episodes of reality.  T. G. listened patiently, fed him, hid him when infrequent patrols went by. T. G. never told him his own story, but a bloated woman who lived with a yellow-toothed man in an abandoned storage tank did one day, her voice echoing from the curving, windowless walls of corrugated plastic. She said T. G. had been an alky chemist, reasonably prosperous, reasonably happy, reasonably married. His wife was the faithful kind and he was not. With unbelievable slyness she had dulled the pain for years with booze and he had never suspected. They say she had killed herself after one frightful week-long debauche in Riveredge. T. G. came down to Riveredge for the body and returned after giving it burial and drawing his savings from the bank. He had never left Riveredge since.  \"Worsh'p the grun' that man walks on,\" the bloated woman mumbled. \"Nev' gets mad, nev' calls you hard names. Give y'a bottle if y' need it. Talk to y' if y' blue. Worsh'p that man.\"  Max Wyman walked from the storage tank, sickened. T. G.'s charity covered that creature and him.  It was the day he told T. G.: \"I'm getting out of here.\"  The gray, paralyzed-looking face almost smiled. \"See a man first?\"  \"Friend of yours?\"  \"Somebody who heard about you. Maybe he can do something for you. He feels the way you do about the Syndic.\"  Wyman clenched his teeth. The pain still came at the thought. Syndic, Hogan, Inge and betrayal. God, to be able to hit back at them!  The red ride ebbed. Suddenly he stared at T. G. and demanded: \"Why? Why should you put me in touch? What is this?\"  T. G. shrugged. \"I don't worry about the Syndic. I worry about people. I've been worrying about you. You're a little insane, Max, like all of us here.\"  \"God damn you!\"  \"He has....\"  Max Wyman paused a long time and said: \"Go on, will you?\" He realized that anybody else would have apologized. But he couldn't and he knew that T. G. knew he couldn't.  The old man said: \"A little insane. Bottled-up hatred. It's better out of you than in. It's better to sock the man you hate and stand a chance of having him sock you back than it is just to hate him and let the hate gnaw you like a grave-worm.\"  \"What've you got against the Syndic?\"  \"Nothing, Max. Nothing against it and nothing for it. What I'm for is people. The Syndic is people. You're people. Slug 'em if you want and they'll have a chance to slug you back. Maybe you'll pull down the Syndic like Samson in the temple; more likely it'll crush you. But you'll be _doing_ something about it. That's the great thing. That's the thing people have to learn--or they wind up in Riveredge.\"  \"You're crazy.\"  \"I told you I was, or I wouldn't be here.\"  The man came at sunset. He was short and pudgy, with a halo of wispy hair and the coldest, grimmest eyes that Wyman had ever seen. He shook hands with Wyman, and the young man noted simultaneously a sharp pain in his finger and that the stranger wore an elaborate gold ring. Then the world got hazy and confused. He had a sense that he was being asked questions, that he was answering them, that it went on for hours and hours.  When things quite suddenly came into focus again, the pudgy man was saying: \"I can introduce myself now. Commander Grinnel, of the North American Navy. My assignment is recruiting. The preliminary examination has satisfied me that you are no plant and would be a desirable citizen of the N. A. Government. I invite you to join us.\"  \"What would I do?\" Wyman asked steadily.  \"That depends on your aptitudes. What do you think you would like to do?\"  Wyman said: \"Kill me some Syndics.\"  The commander stared at him with those cold eyes. He said at last: \"It can probably be arranged. Come with me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went by train to Cape Cod. At midnight on January 15th, the commander and Wyman left their hotel room and strolled about the streets. The commander taped small packets to the four legs of the microwave relay tower that connected Cape Cod with the Continental Press common carrier circuits and taped other packets to the police station's motor pool gate.  At 1:00 A.M., the tower exploded and the"]]]
