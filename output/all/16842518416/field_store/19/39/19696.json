What did you say your name was, miss?\"  \"Jen Jervis,\" she said. \"Geneva Jervis, formally.\"  \"Miss Jervis. I'm Civek. You know Mr. Cort, I suppose.\"  The girl smiled sideways. \"We have a nodding acquaintance.\" Don nodded and grinned.  \"There's plenty of room in the dormitories,\" Civek said. \"People don't exactly pound on the gates and scream to be admitted to Cavalier.\"  \"Are you connected with the college?\" Don asked.  \"Me? No. I'm the mayor of Superior. The old town's really come up in the world, hasn't it?\"  \"Overnight,\" Geneva Jervis said. \"If what Mr. Cort and the fireman say is true. I haven't seen the edge myself.\"  \"You'll have a better chance to look at it in the morning,\" the mayor said, \"if we don't settle back in the meantime.\"  \"Was there any sort of explosion?\" Don asked.  \"No. There wasn't any sensation at all, as far as I noticed. I was watching the late show--or trying to. My house is down in a hollow and reception isn't very good, especially with old English movies. Well, all of a sudden the picture sharpened up and I could see just as plain. Then the phone rang and it was Professor Garet.\"  \"The old fellow with the whiskers and the riding boots?\" Jen Jervis asked.  \"Yes. Osbert Garet, Professor of Magnology at the Cavalier Institute of Applied Sciences.\"  \"Professor of what?\"  \"Magnology. As I say, the school isn't accredited. Well, Professor Garet telephoned and said, 'Hector'--that's my name, Hector Civek--'everything's up in the air.' He was having his little joke, of course. I said, 'What?' and then he told me.\"  \"Told you what?\" Jen Jervis asked. \"I mean, does he have any theory about it?\"  \"He has a theory about everything. I think what he was trying to convey was that this--this levitation confirmed his magnology principle.\"  \"What's that?\" Don asked.  \"I haven't the faintest idea. I'm a politician, not a scientist. Professor Garet went on about it for a while, on the telephone, about magnetism and gravity, but I think he was only calling as a courtesy, so the mayor wouldn't look foolish the next morning, not knowing his town had flown the coop.\"  \"What's the population of Superior?\"  \"Three thousand, including the students at the institute. Three thousand and forty, counting you people from the train. I guess you'll be with us for a while.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" Jen Jervis asked.  \"Well, I don't see how you can get down. Do you?\"  \"Does Superior have an airport?\" Don asked. \"I've got to get back to--to Earth.\" It sounded odd to put it that way.  \"Nope,\" Civek said. \"No airport. No place for a plane to land, either.\"  \"Maybe not a plane,\" Don said, \"but a helicopter could land just about anywhere.\"  \"No helicopters here, either.\"  \"Maybe not. But I'll bet they're swarming all over you by morning.\"  \"Hm,\" said Hector Civek. Don couldn't quite catch his expression in the rearview mirror. \"I suppose they could, at that. Well, here's Cavalier. You go right in that door, where the others are going. There's Professor Garet. I've got to see him--excuse me.\"  The mayor was off across the campus. Don looked at Geneva Jervis, who was frowning. \"Are you thinking,\" he asked, \"that Mayor Civek was perhaps just a little less than completely honest with us?\"  \"I'm thinking,\" she said, \"that I should have stayed with Aunt Hattie another night, then taken a plane to Washington.\"  \"Washington?\" Don said. \"That's where I'm going. I mean where I _was_ going before Superior became airborne. What do you do in Washington, Miss Jervis?\"  \"I work for the Government. Doesn't everybody?\"  \"Not everybody. Me, for instance.\"  \"No?\" she said. \"Judging by that satchel you're handcuffed to, I'd have thought you were a courier for the Pentagon. Or maybe State.\"  He laughed quickly and loudly because she was getting uncomfortably close. \"Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous. I'm a messenger for the Riggs National Bank, that's all. Where do you work?\"  \"I'm with Senator Bobby Thebold, S.O.B.\"  Don laughed again. \"He sure is.\"  \"_Mister_ Cort!\" she said, annoyed. \"You know as well as I do that S.O.B. stands for Senate Office Building. I'm his secretary.\"  \"I'm sorry. We'd better get out and find a place to sleep. It's getting late.\"  \"_Places_ to sleep,\" she corrected. She looked angry.  \"Of course,\" Don said, puzzled by her emphasis. \"Come on. Where they put you, you'll probably be surrounded by co-eds, even if I could get out of this cuff.\"  He took her bag in his free hand and they were met by a gray-haired woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Garet. \"We'll try to make you comfortable,\" she said. \"What a night, eh? The professor is simply beside himself. We haven't had so much excitement since the cosmolineator blew up.\"  They had a glimpse of the professor, still in his CD helmet, going around a corner, gesticulating wildly to someone wearing a white laboratory smock.     II   Don Cort had slept, but not well. He had tried to fold the brief case to pull it through his sleeve so he could take his coat off, but whatever was inside the brief case was too big. Cavalier had given him a room to himself at one end of a dormitory and he'd taken his pants off but had had to sleep with his coat and shirt on. He got up, feeling gritty, and did what little dressing was necessary.  It was eight o'clock, according to the watch on the unhandcuffed wrist, and things were going on. He had a view of the campus from his window. A bright sun shone on young people moving generally toward a squat building, and other people going in random directions. The first were students going to breakfast, he supposed, and the others were faculty members. The air was very clear and the long morning shadows distinct. Only then did he remember completely that he and the whole town of Superior were up in the air.  He went through the dormitory. A few students were still sleeping. The others had gone from their unmade beds. He shivered as he stepped outdoors. It was crisp, if not freezing, and his breath came out visibly. First he'd eat, he decided, so he'd be strong enough to go take a good look over the edge, in broad daylight, to the Earth below.  The mess hall, or whatever they called it, was cafeteria style and he got in line with a tray for juice, eggs and coffee. He saw no one he knew, but as he was looking for a table a willowy blonde girl smiled and gestured to the empty place opposite her.  \"You're Mr. Cort,\" she said. \"Won't you join me?\"  \"Thanks,\" he said, unloading his tray. \"How did you know?\"  \"The mystery man with the handcuff. You'd be hard to miss. I'm Alis--that's A-l-i-s, not A-l-i-c-e--Garet. Are you with the FBI? Or did you escape from jail?\"  \"How do you do. No, just a bank messenger. What an unusual name. Professor Garet's daughter?\"  \"The same,\" she said. \"Also the only. A pity, because if there'd been two of us I'd have had a fifty-fifty chance of going to OSU. As it is, I'm duty-bound to represent the second generation at the nut factory.\"  \"Nut factory? You mean Cavalier?\" Don struggled to manipulate knife and fork without knocking things off the table with his clinging brief case.  \"Here, let me cut your eggs for you,\" Alis said. \"You'd better order them scrambled tomorrow. Yes, Cavalier. Home of the crackpot theory and the latter-day alchemist.\"  \"I'm sure it's not that bad. Thanks. As for tomorrow, I hope to be out of here by then.\"  \"How do you get down from an elephant? Old riddle. You don't; you get down from ducks. How do you plan to get down from Superior?\"  \"I'll find a way. I'm more interested at the moment in how I got up here.\"  \"You were levitated, like everybody else.\"  \"You make it sound deliberate, Miss Garet, as if somebody hoisted a whole patch of real estate for some fell purpose.\"  \"Scarcely _fell_, Mr. Cort. As for it being deliberate, that seems to be a matter of opinion. Apparently you haven't seen the papers.\"  \"I didn't know there were any.\"  \"Actually there's only one, the _Superior Sentry_, a weekly. This is an extra. Ed Clark must have been up all night getting it out.\" She opened her purse and unfolded a four-page tabloid.  Don blinked at the headline:       TOWN GETS HIGH  \"Ed Clark's something of an eccentric, like everybody else in Superior,\" Alis said.  Don read the story, which seemed to him a capricious treatment of an apparently grave situation.  _Residents having business beyond the outskirts of town today are advised not to. It's a long way down. Where Superior was surrounded by Ohio, as usual, today Superior ends literally at the town line._  _A Citizens' Emergency Fence-Building Committee is being formed, but in the meantime all are warned to stay well away from the edge. The law of gravity seems to have been repealed for the town but it is doubtful if the same exemption would apply to a dubious individual bent on investigating...._  Don skimmed the rest. \"I don't see anything about it being deliberate.\"  Alis had been creaming and sugaring Don's coffee. She pushed it across to him and said, \"It's not on page one. Ed Clark and Mayor Civek don't get along, so you'll find the mayor's statement in a box on page three, bottom.\"  Don creased the paper the other way, took a sip of coffee, nodded his thanks, and read:       MAYOR CLAIMS SECESSION FROM EARTH  _Mayor Hector Civek, in a proclamation issued locally by hand and dropped to the rest of the world in a plastic shatter-proof bottle, said today that Superior has seceded from Earth. His reasons were as vague as his explanation._  _The \"reasons\" include these: (1) Superior has been discriminated against by county, state and federal agencies; (2) Cavalier Institute has been held up to global derision by orthodox (presumably meaning accredited) colleges and universities; and (3) chicle exporters have conspired against the Superior Bubble Gum Company by unreasonably raising prices._  _The \"explanation\" consists of a 63-page treatise on applied magnology by Professor Osbert Garet of Cavalier which the editor (a) does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42111"],["title","And Then the Town Took Off (#2)"],["body","understand; (b) lacks space to publish; and which (it being atrociously handwritten) he (c) has not the temerity to ask his linotype operator to set._  Don said, \"I'm beginning to like this Ed Clark.\"  \"He's a doll,\" Alis said. \"He's about the only one in town who stands up to Father.\"  \"Does your father claim that _he_ levitated Superior off the face of the Earth?\"  \"Not to me he doesn't. I'm one of those banes of his existence, a skeptic. He gave up trying to magnolize me when I was sixteen. I had a science teacher in high school--not in Superior, incidentally--who gave me all kinds of embarrassing questions to ask Father. I asked them, being a natural-born needler, and Father has disowned me intellectually ever since.\"  \"How old are you, Miss Garet, if I may ask?\"  She sat up straight and tucked her sweater tightly into her skirt, emphasizing her good figure. To a male friend Don would have described the figure as outstanding. She had mocking eyes, a pert nose and a mouth of such moist red softness that it seemed perpetually waiting to be kissed. All in all she could have been the queen of a campus much more densely populated with co-eds than Cavalier was.  \"You may call me Alis,\" she said. \"And I'm nineteen.\"  Don grinned. \"Going on?\"  \"Three months past. How old are _you_, Mr. Cort?\"  \"Don's the name I've had for twenty-six years. Please use it.\"  \"Gladly. And now, Don, unless you want another cup of coffee, I'll go with you to the end of the world.\"  \"On such short notice?\" Don was intrigued. Last night the redhead from the club car had repelled an advance that hadn't been made, and this morning a blonde was apparently making an advance that hadn't been solicited. He wondered where Geneva Jervis was, but only vaguely.  \"I'll admit to the _double entendre_,\" Alis said. \"What I meant--for now--was that we can stroll out to where Superior used to be attached to the rest of Ohio and see how the Earth is getting along without us.\"  \"Delighted. But don't you have any classes?\"  \"Sure I do. Non-Einsteinian Relativity 1, at nine o'clock. But I'm a demon class-cutter, which is why I'm still a Senior at my advanced age. On to the brink!\"         *       *       *       *       *  They walked south from the campus and came to the railroad track. The train was standing there with nowhere to go. It had been abandoned except for the conductor, who had dutifully spent the night aboard.  \"What's happening?\" he asked when he saw them. \"Any word from down there?\"  \"Not that I know of,\" Don said. He introduced him to Alis Garet. \"What are you going to do?\"  \"What _can_ I do?\" the conductor asked.  \"You can go over to Cavalier and have breakfast,\" Alis said. \"Nobody's going to steal your old train.\"  The conductor reckoned as how he might just do that, and did.  \"You know,\" Don said, \"I was half-asleep last night but before the train stopped I thought it was running alongside a creek for a while.\"  \"South Creek,\" Alis said. \"That's right. It's just over there.\"  \"Is it still? I mean hasn't it all poured off the edge by now? Was that Superior's water supply?\"  Alis shrugged. \"All I know is you turn on the faucet and there's water. Let's go look at the creek.\"  They found it coursing along between the banks.  \"Looks just about the same,\" she said.  \"That's funny. Come on; let's follow it to the edge.\"  The brink, as Alis called it, looked even more awesome by daylight. Everything stopped short. There were the remnants of a cornfield, with the withered stalks cut down, then there was nothing. There was South Creek surging along, then nothing. In the distance a clump of trees, with a few autumn leaves still clinging to their branches, simply ended.  \"Where is the water going?\" Don asked. \"I can't make it out.\"  \"Down, I'd say. Rain for the Earth-people.\"  \"I should think it'd be all dried up by now. I'm going to have a look.\"  \"Don't! You'll fall off!\"  \"I'll be careful.\" He walked cautiously toward the edge. Alis followed him, a few feet behind. He stopped a yard from the brink and waited for a spell of dizziness to pass. The Earth was spread out like a topographer's map, far below. Don took another wary step, then sat down.  \"Chicken,\" said Alis. She laughed uncertainly, then she sat down, too.  \"I still can't see where the water goes,\" Don said. He stretched out on his stomach and began to inch forward. \"You stay there.\"  Finally he had inched to a point where, by stretching out a hand, he could almost reach the edge. He gave another wriggle and the fingers of his right hand closed over the brink. For a moment he lay there, panting, head pressed to the ground.  \"How do you feel?\" Alis asked.  \"Scared. When I get my courage back I'll pick up my head and look.\"  Alis put a hand out tentatively, then purposefully took hold of his ankle and held it tight. \"Just in case a high wind comes along,\" she said.  \"Thanks. It helps. Okay, here we go.\" He lifted his head. \"Damn.\"  \"What?\"  \"It still isn't clear. Do you have a pocket mirror?\"  \"I have a compact.\" She took it out of her bag with her free hand and tossed it to him. It rolled and Don had to grab to keep it from going over the edge. Alis gave a little shriek. Don was momentarily unnerved and had to put his head back on the ground. \"Sorry,\" she said.  Don opened the compact and carefully transferred it to his right hand. He held it out beyond the edge and peered into it, focusing it on the end of the creek. \"Now I've got it. The water _isn't_ going off the edge!\"  \"It isn't? Then where is it going?\"  \"Down, of course, but it's as if it's going into a well, or a vertical tunnel, just short of the edge.\"  \"Why? How?\"  \"I can't see too well, but that's my impression. Hold on now. I'm coming back.\" He inched away from the edge, then got up and brushed himself off. He returned her compact. \"I guess you know where we go next.\"  \"The other end of the creek?\"  \"Exactly.\"  South Creek did not bisect Superior, as Don thought it might, but flowed in an arc through a southern segment of it. They had about two miles to go, past South Creek Bridge--which used to lead to Ladenburg, Alis said--past Raleigh Country Club (a long drive would really put the ball out of play, Don thought) and on to the edge again.  But as they approached what they were forced to consider the source of the creek, they found a wire fence at the spot. \"This is new,\" Alis said.  The fence, which had a sign on it, WARNING--ELECTRIFIED, was semicircular, with each end at the edge and tarpaulins strung behind it so they could see the mouth of the creek. The water flowed from under the tarp and fence.  \"Look how it comes in spurts,\" Alis said.  \"As if it's being pumped.\"  Smaller print on the sign said: _Protecting mouth of South Creek, one of two sources of water for Superior. Electrical charge in fence is sufficient to kill._ It was signed: _Vincent Grande, Chief of Police, Hector Civek, Mayor_.  \"What's the other source, besides the faucet in your bathroom?\" Don asked.  \"North Lake, maybe,\" Alis said. \"People fish there but nobody's allowed to swim.\"  \"Is the lake entirely within the town limits?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"If it were on the edge, and if I took a rowboat out on it, I wonder what would happen?\"  \"I know one thing--I wouldn't be there holding your ankle while you found out.\"  She took his arm as they gazed past the electrified fence at the Earth below and to the west.  \"It's impressive, isn't it?\" she said. \"I wonder if that's Indiana way over there?\"  He patted her hand absent-mindedly. \"I wonder if it's west at all. I mean, how do we know Superior is maintaining the same position up here as it used to down there?\"  \"We could tell by the sun, silly.\"  \"Of course,\" he said, grinning at his stupidity. \"And I guess we're not high enough to see very far. If we were we'd be able to see the Great Lakes--or Lake Erie, anyway.\"  They were musing about the geography when a plane came out of a cloudbank and, a second later, veered sharply. They could make out UAL on the underside of a wing. As it turned they imagined they could see faces peering out of the windows. They waved and thought they saw one or two people wave back. Then the plane climbed toward the east and was gone.  \"Well,\" Don said as they turned to go back to Cavalier, \"now we know that they know. Maybe we'll begin to get some answers. Or, if not answers, then transportation.\"  \"Transportation?\" Alis squeezed the arm she was holding. \"Why? Don't you like it here?\"  \"If you mean don't I like you, the answer is yes, of course I do. But if I don't get out of this handcuff soon so I can take a bath and get into clean clothes, you're not going to like me.\"  \"You're still quite acceptable, if a bit whiskery.\" She stopped, still holding his arm, and he turned so they were face to face. \"So kiss me,\" she said, \"before you deteriorate.\"  They were in the midst of an extremely pleasant kiss when the brief case at the end of Don's handcuff began to talk to him.     III   Much of the rest of the world was inclined to regard the elevation of Superior, Ohio, as a Fortean phenomenon in the same category as flying saucers and sea monsters.  The press had a field day. Most of the headlines were whimsical:       TOWN TAKES OFF       SUPERIOR LIVES UP TO NAME       A RISING COMMUNITY  The city council of Superior, Wisconsin, passed a resolution urging its Ohio namesake to come back down. The Superiors in Nebraska, Wyoming, Arizona and West Virginia, glad to have the publicity, added their voices to the plea.  The Pennsylvania Railroad filed a suit demanding that the state of Ohio return forthwith one train and five miles of right-of-way.  The price of bubble gum went up from one cent to three for a nickel.  In Parliament a Labour member rose to ask the Home Secretary for assurances that all British cities were firmly fastened down.  An Ohio waterworks put in a bid for the sixteen square miles of hole that Superior had left behind, explaining that it would make a fine"]]]
