Had they overheard and questioned him, he would probably have disclosed some of the projects which were as yet in embryo in his own mind; and in that case what disastrous consequences might have been averted.  M. d’Escorval had regained his usual coolness.  “Now, my dear friend,” he inquired, “what course do you propose to pursue with these members of the Sairmeuse family?”  “They will hear nothing more from me--for some time, at least.”  “What! Shall you not claim the ten thousand francs that they owe you?”  “I shall ask them for nothing.”  “You will be compelled to do so. Since you have alluded to the legacy, your own honor will demand that you insist upon its payment by all legal methods. There are still judges in France.”  M. Lacheneur shook his head.  “The judges will not accord me the justice I desire. I shall not apply to them.”  “But----”  “No, Monsieur, no. I wish to have nothing to do with these men. I shall not even go to the chateau to remove my clothing nor that of my daughter. If they send it to us--very well. If it pleases them to keep it, so much the better. The more shameful, infamous and odious their conduct appears, the better I shall be satisfied.”  The baron made no reply; but his wife spoke, believing she had a sure means of conquering this incomprehensible obstinacy.  “I should understand your determination if you were alone in the world,”  said she, “but you have children.”  “My son is eighteen, Madame; he possesses good health and an excellent education. He can make his own way in Paris, if he chooses to remain there.”  “But your daughter?”  “Marie-Anne will remain with me.”  M. d’Escorval thought it his duty to interfere.  “Take care, my dear friend, that your grief does not overthrow your reason,” said he. “Reflect! What will become of you--your daughter and yourself?”  The wretched man smiled sadly.  “Oh,” he replied, “we are not as destitute as I said. I exaggerated our misfortune. We are still landed proprietors. Last year an old cousin, whom I could never induce to come and live at Sairmeuse, died, bequeathing all her property to Marie-Anne. This property consisted of a poor little cottage near the Reche, with a little garden and a few acres of sterile land. In compliance with my daughter’s entreaties, I repaired the cottage, and sent there a few articles of furniture--a table, some chairs, and a couple of beds. My daughter designed it as a home for old Father Guvat and his wife. And I, surrounded by wealth and luxury, said to myself: ‘How comfortable those two old people will be there. They will live as snug as a bug in a rug!’ Well, what I thought so comfortable for others, will be good enough for me. I will raise vegetables, and Marie-Anne shall sell them.”  Was he speaking seriously?  Maurice must have supposed so, for he sprang forward.  “This shall not be, Monsieur Lacheneur!” he exclaimed.  “Oh----”  “No, this shall not be, for I love Marie-Anne, and I ask you to give her to me for my wife.”    CHAPTER VI  Maurice and Marie-Anne had loved each other for many years.  As children, they had played together in the magnificent grounds surrounding the Chateau de Sairmeuse, and in the park at Escorval.  Together they chased the brilliant butterflies, searched for pebbles on the banks of the river, or rolled in the hay while their mothers sauntered through the meadows bordering the Oiselle.  For their mothers were friends.  Mme. Lacheneur had been reared like other poor peasant girls; that is to say, on the day of her marriage it was only with great difficulty she succeeded in inscribing her name upon the register.  But from the example of her husband she had learned that prosperity, as well as _noblesse_, entails certain obligations upon one, and with rare courage, crowned with still rarer success, she had undertaken to acquire an education in keeping with her fortune and her new rank.  And the baroness had made no effort to resist the sympathy that attracted her to this meritorious young woman, in whom she had discerned a really superior mind and a truly refined nature.  When Mme. Lacheneur died, Mme. d’Escorval mourned for her as she would have mourned for a favorite sister.  From that moment Maurice’s attachment assumed a more serious character.  Educated in a Parisian lyceum, his teachers sometimes had occasion to complain of his want of application.  “If your professors are not satisfied with you,” said his mother, “you shall not accompany me to Escorval on the coming of your vacation, and you will not see your little friend.”  And this simple threat was always sufficient to make the school-boy resume his studies with redoubled diligence.  So each year, as it passed, strengthened the _grande passion_ which preserved Maurice from the restlessness and the errors of adolescence.  The two children were equally timid and artless, and equally infatuated with each other.  Long walks in the twilight under the eyes of their parents, a glance that revealed their delight at meeting each other, flowers exchanged between them--which were religiously preserved--such were their simple pleasures.  But that magical and sublime word, love--so sweet to utter, and so sweet to hear--had never once dropped from their lips.  The audacity of Maurice had never gone beyond a furtive pressure of the hand.  The parents could not be ignorant of this mutual affection; and if they pretended to shut their eyes, it was only because it did not displease them nor disturb their plans.  M. and Mme. d’Escorval saw no objection to their son’s marriage with a young girl whose nobility of character they appreciated, and who was as beautiful as she was good. That she was the richest heiress in all the country round about was naturally no objection.  So far as M. Lacheneur was concerned, he was delighted at the prospect of a marriage which would ally him, a former ploughboy, with an old family whose head was universally respected.  So, although no direct allusion to the subject had ever escaped the lips of the baron or of M. Lacheneur, there was a tacit agreement between the two families.  Yes, the marriage was considered a foregone conclusion.  And yet this impetuous and unexpected declaration by Maurice struck everyone dumb.  In spite of his agitation, the young man perceived the effect produced by his words, and frightened by his own boldness, he turned and looked questioningly at his father.  The baron’s face was grave, even sad; but his attitude expressed no displeasure.  This gave renewed courage to the anxious lover.  “You will excuse me, Monsieur,” he said, addressing Lacheneur, “for presenting my request in such a manner, and at such a time. But surely, when fate glowers ominously upon you, that is the time when your friends should declare themselves--and deem themselves fortunate if their devotion can make you forget the infamous treatment to which you have been subjected.”  As he spoke, he was watching Marie-Anne.  Blushing and embarrassed, she turned away her head, perhaps to conceal the tears which inundated her face--tears of joy and of gratitude.  The love of the man she adored came forth victorious from a test which it would not be prudent for many heiresses to impose.  Now she could truly say that she knew Maurice’s heart.  He, however, continued:  “I have not consulted my father, sir; but I know his affection for me and his esteem for you. When the happiness of my life is at stake, he will not oppose me. He, who married my dear mother without a dowry, must understand my feelings.”  He was silent, awaiting the verdict.  “I approve your course, my son,” said M. d’Escorval, deeply affected; “you have conducted yourself like an honorable man. Certainly you are very young to become the head of a family; but, as you say, circumstances demand it.”  He turned to M. Lacheneur, and added:  “My dear friend, I, in my son’s behalf, ask the hand of your daughter in marriage.”  Maurice had not expected so little opposition.  In his delight he was almost tempted to bless the hateful Duc de Sairmeuse, to whom he would owe his approaching happiness.  He sprang toward his father, and seizing his hands, he raised them to his lips, faltering:  “Thanks! you are so good! I love you! Oh, how happy I am!”  Alas! the poor boy was in too much haste to rejoice.  A gleam of pride flashed in M. Lacheneur’s eyes; but his face soon resumed its gloomy expression.  “Believe me, Monsieur le Baron, I am deeply touched by your grandeur of soul--yes, deeply touched. You wish to make me forget my humiliation; but, for this very reason, I should be the most contemptible of men if I did not refuse the great honor you desire to confer upon my daughter.”  “What!” exclaimed the baron, in utter astonishment; “you refuse?”  “I am compelled to do so.”  Thunderstruck at first, Maurice afterward renewed the attack with an energy which no one had ever suspected in his character before.  “Do you, then, wish to ruin my life, Monsieur?” he exclaimed; “to ruin _our_ life; for if I love Marie-Anne, she also loves me.”  It was easy to see that he spoke the truth. The unhappy girl, crimson with happy blushes the moment before, had suddenly become whiter than marble, as she looked imploringly at her father.  “It cannot be,” repeated M. Lacheneur; “and the day will come when you will bless the decision I make known at this moment.”  Alarmed by her son’s evident agony, Mme. d’Escorval interposed:  “You must have reasons for this refusal.”  “None that I can disclose, Madame. But never while I live shall my daughter be your son’s wife!”  “Ah! it will kill my child!” exclaimed the baroness.  M. Lacheneur shook his head.  “Monsieur Maurice,” said he, “is young; he will console himself--he will forget.”  “Never!” interrupted the unhappy lover--“never!”  “And your daughter?” inquired the baroness.  Ah! this was the weak spot in his armor; the instinct of a mother was not mistaken. M. Lacheneur hesitated a moment; but he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40073"],["title","A Lively Bit of the Front: A Tale of the New Zealand Rifles on the Western Front (#0)"],["body","LIVELY BIT OF THE FRONT   BLACKIE & SON LIMITED 50 Old Bailey, LONDON 17 Stanhope Street, GLASGOW  BLACKIE & SON (INDIA) LIMITED Warwick House, Fort Street, BOMBAY  BLACKIE & SON (CANADA) LIMITED TORONTO  [Frontispiece: HE HAD BLUNDERED RIGHT INTO A PARTY OF HUNS]   A LIVELY BIT OF THE FRONT  A Tale of the New Zealand Rifles on the Western Front  BY PERCY F.

Expecting anything important?\"  Malcolm Carr was a typical specimen of the youthful New Zealander. Although only seventeen years of age, he was a full inch over six feet in height, and, although broad across the shoulders, was sparely built yet supple of frame. His features were clear-cut and slightly elongated. A massive chin betokened force of character. His deep-set, grey eyes gave promise of an alertness and keenness of vision that are the attributes of a healthy, open-air life.  He was dressed in a soft flannel shirt open at the neck, buckskin riding-breeches, leggings, and strong laced boots, the latter provided with spurs. On his left wrist he wore a watch in a leather case that bore signs of hard usage and exposure to the weather. Attached to his belt was a sheath-knife, while in contrast to his up-country appearance he carried in the breast-pocket of his shirt a canvas-covered notebook, a couple of pencils, and a fountain-pen.  His companion, Dick Selwyn, differed little from him in appearance and attire. He was barely half an inch shorter than Malcolm--they raise tall youths in New Zealand--of greater girth, and slightly heavier. His large, muscular hands, however, were a marked contrast to the slim, supple, well-kept pair on which young Carr prided himself.  Both lads were pupils under the State Railways Department of the Dominion. Their college course completed, they were assisting in the survey of the Wairakato valley, where a projected line was about to be commenced to link up the east and west coasts of South Island.  It was an ideal existence, under perfect climatic conditions. The month was November--late spring. For three weeks no rain had fallen, yet on the breezy uplands the ground was green with verdure. Away to the west could be discerned the lofty ridges of the Southern Alps, some of the loftier peaks still retaining their garb of snow. To the eastward the ground sloped irregularly until the hilly country merged into the fertile plains that terminated upon the shores of Pegasus Bay.  Beyond the small collection of corrugated-iron huts and tents there were no signs of other human habitation. Farmsteads were few and far between in the Wairakato valley. Thirty miles of indifferent road separated the camp from the nearest village, while another forty miles had to be covered before the town of Christchurch--Malcolm's home--was reached.  \"Hope the post will arrive before we start,\" remarked Carr as he turned to enter the hut, from which wafted the appetizing odour of frying eggs and bacon, the fumes of cheap kerosene notwithstanding. \"Tell Kaitiu to take the large theodolite down to No. 4, and to be a jolly sight more careful than he was yesterday. Any signs of the Boss yet?\"  Receiving a negative reply, Malcolm set to work to lay the table for breakfast--the two lads shared the same hut and meals. The interior of the hut was plainly yet substantially furnished. Table and chairs occupied a considerable portion of the floor space. Against the walls were cupboards and lockers, the latter mostly filled with plans and drawings. At one end was an oil stove, with a meagre supply of crockery and ironware above. Immediately opposite was a door leading into the sleeping-room. In one corner were a couple of sporting rifles and some fishing-rods, against which was leaning one of those ubiquitous objects of modern civilization--a motor tyre.  It was mainly on account of that motor tyre that Malcolm was anxious for the arrival of the camp postman. A new inner tube was wanted--badly. Without it there were long odds against juggernaut making the seventy-odd-mile run into Christchurch on the coming Saturday.  Juggernaut, minus one tyre, stood without, sheltering under a rick-cloth that did duty for a garage. A car of ancient and composite design--partly Daimler, partly Darracq, and with a suspicion of half a dozen makers' parts in the _tout ensemble_--the wondrous, once-discarded vehicle had been given to Peter and Malcolm Carr by a cousin of theirs. Being of a mechanical turn of mind, the two brothers soon reduced the motor to a state of servile tractability, although there was hardly a thoroughfare in Christchurch whose buildings did not bear a more or less permanent record of Juggernaut's frailties.  Peter Carr--big, easy-going, generous Peter--had gone two years previously. Enlisting in the first contingent, he had taken part in the repulse of the first Turkish invasion of Egypt and the heroic yet ill-starred Gallipoli campaign without receiving as much as a scratch, and having hardly spent a day in hospital. From Gallipoli Peter went to France, and up to the present his luck still held. But before going on active service Peter had disposed of his share of juggernaut to his young brother, thus, in a manner, helping to mitigate Malcolm's regret that he was not at least two years older, and thus able to share with his brother the honour, glory, and vicissitudes of fighting the Boche.  \"Grub!\" announced Malcolm laconically.  \"Right-o!\" was the muffled response as Dick \"barracked\" into the hut, still scrubbing his face vigorously with a towel. \"Kaitiu's taken the gear down to No. 4, and the Boss wants to see you in his office at nine.\"  Breakfast over, and the empty cups and plates subjected to a thorough washing and drying, Malcolm prepared for his day's work.  \"Post!\" shouted Dick, as a dust-smothered vehicle known as a buggy, driven by an equally dusty man, appeared in sight down the dusty road.  Malcolm Carr knew his man. A large pannikin of tea awaited the postman, for the jaded animal a bucketful of water. While the representative of the Dominion State Post was refreshing, the lad could obtain his mails without having to go down to the works office.  \"Now we're all right, Dick,\" remarked Malcolm as the postman handed him a parcel containing the anxiously-awaited inner tube. \"I'll be able to give you a lift down to Springfield on Saturday. What! More of them? A regular budget, Mike!\"  Mike the postman grinned approvingly as he handed over four newspaper packets and half a dozen letters, while Dick's consignment showed that that worthy was by no means forgotten.  The first letter Malcolm opened was from his brother Peter--\"Somewhere in France\".    \"DEAR MALCOLM (it ran),    \"U-boats and other noxious German insects permitting, I hope this   will reach you. I cannot say much beyond that we are very busy on   our sector of the Front. I'm afraid you'll be too late to join me   out here, unless the war goes on for another two or three years.   Our chaps are of the opinion that it won't. We are having a   thundering good time, with plenty of excitement. I have a Hun   helmet for you. I gained it properly, after a tough scrap in a   mine gallery, but cannot give details. It's no more risky out here   than it is driving juggernaut through the market-square on a   Saturday night.
