The observing Mr. Say has likewise proposed another under the name of _Alasmodonta_, which, however, I shall take another opportunity of noticing.  I have ventured to exchange the ungrammatical name of _Anodonta_, given by Bruguiere to this genus, for _Anodon_, at the suggestion of the learned Dr. Goodall, Provost of Eton College.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 97  [Illustration]  MARGINELLA,  _Date Shell._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa ovata.

Generic Types _Vol. perspicula, glabella, prunum, &c._ Lin.         *       *       *       *       *  Lamarck first separated the shells comprised in this genus from the Volutes of Linnæus; their principal distinction rests in the formation of the outer lip, which has a very thick margin, more or less toothed on the inner rim; the base likewise is nearly entire, and the inner lip quite wanting.  By these peculiarities, the _Date Shells_ are easily known from the _Volutes_ on the one hand, and the _Cowries_ on the other; and the invaluable researches of M. Adanson, who has described and figured the animals of each of these genera, has established this distinction on the most solid principles; it will, however, be interesting to trace, by the shells only, how beautifully this arrangement is developed.  The _Marginellæ_ may be divided into two sections; the first bearing in form and habit a strong resemblance to the _Cyprææ_, and the second gradually losing these indications, and acquiring those of the spiral _Volutæ_. Among the first are several species, which, like the Cowries, appear destitute of any spire (as in _M. cingulata_); this part, however, begins to show itself in other successive species very progressively, until it becomes elevated and defined in _M. glabella_. This shell may be considered the passage to the second division, in which the species lose the simple oval form of the first, and acquire a contracted base and pointed spire, perfectly resembling _Voluta undulata Lam._ and its allies. The extreme developement of these characters is shown in _M. faba_.  This genus must, then, be considered as connecting those of _Cypræa_ and _Voluta_ (Lam.); excepting one, the whole of the species are very small; and as the three here selected to illustrate these remarks are frequently seen, and have been often described under other names, little more is necessary than to detail their specific characters.         *       *       *       *       *  MARGINELLA cingulata,  _Banded Date Shell--upper figures._      _M. testâ ovatâ, albidâ, lineis aurantiacis fasciatâ; spirâ obsoletâ,     umbilicatâ; columellâ 6 plicatâ._      Shell oval, whitish, banded with orange lines; spire obsolete,     umbilicated; pillar 6 plaited.

Science should make no distinction of persons or countries; but it is rather mortifying to observe, that these important discoveries in the organization of animals, are pursued with zeal and ability by foreign naturalists, while most of our own content themselves with expatiating on its impossibility, and even go so far as to hint its uselessness, because we can never become acquainted with the animals of _all_ the species of shells in our cabinets: so far this latter part of the argument is most true; but, to ascertain, for instance, the animal of the Cowry, it is surely not requisite we should see those of _all_ the species (near 80 in number), before we venture to describe it? any more than it is necessary completely to dissect _every_ species of Locust before we pronounce it to be one. Science would, indeed, receive incalculable and lasting benefit, if those of our conchologists who reside near the coast would pay greater attention to the inhabiting animals, and less to the shells, of their neighbourhood; for the first would supply that information they acknowledge is so desirable, and the latter would prevent our indigenous Catalogue from being crowded with many dubious, and even foreign shells.  English conchologists appear not to be aware of the vast number of testaceous animals which are now known. Among those truly eminent men who have prosecuted this study, M. Adanson stands foremost, in having minutely described all those he found on the African coast; in the magnificent work of Poli nearly all the Mediterranean bivalves are exquisitely figured; and those of the land and fresh water will receive complete illustration from M. Ferrusac. Cuvier, Lamarck, Say, and even our own countrymen, Dr. Leach and Montague, have all contributed, more or less, to form a mass of information which it is full time should be employed as the basis of natural classification.         *       *       *       *       *  PALUDINA elongata,  _Long-spired River Snail--upper and lower figures._         *       *       *       *       *      _P. testâ olivaceo-fuscâ, fasciis castaneis ornatâ; spirâ productâ,     attenuatâ, aperturâ multo longiore; apice acuto._      Shell olive brown, with chesnut bands; spire lengthened, attenuated,     much longer than the aperture; tip acute.         *       *       *       *       *  Inhabits the rivers of India.

CHAPTER I.  CROSSING THE MEDITERRANEAN--ALEXANDRIA--CAIRO--THE PYRAMIDS.   On the Bosphorus there are birds which the Turks call \"lost souls,\" as they are never at rest. They are always on the wing, like stormy petrels, flying swift and low, just skimming the waters, yet darting like arrows, as if seeking for something which they could not find on land or sea. This spirit of unrest sometimes enters into other wanderers than those of the air. One feels it strongly as he comes to the end of one continent, and \"casts off\" for another; as he leaves the firm, familiar ground, and sails away to the distant and the unknown.  So felt a couple of travellers who had left America to go around the world, and after six months in Europe, were now to push on to the farthest East. It was an autumn afternoon near the close of the year 1875, that they left Constantinople, and sailed down the Marmora, and through the Dardanelles, between the Castles of Europe and Asia, whose very names suggested the continents that they were leaving behind, and set their faces towards Africa.  They could not go to Palestine. An alarm of cholera in Damascus had caused a _cordon sanitaire_ to be drawn along the Syrian coast; and though they might get in, they could not so easily get away; or would be detained ten days in a Lazaretto before they could pass into Egypt; and so they were obliged at the last moment to turn from the Holy Land, and sail direct for Alexandria; touching, however, at Mitylene and Scio; and passing a day at Smyrna and at Syra. With these detentions the voyage took nearly a week, almost as long as to cross the Atlantic.  But it was not without its compensations. There was a motley company in the cabin, made up of all nations and all religions: English and Americans, French and Germans and Russians, Greeks and Turks, Christians and Mohammedans. There was a grand old Turk, who was going out to be a judge in Mecca, and was travelling with his harem, eight women, who were carefully screened from the observation of profane eyes. And there were other Mussulmans of rank, gentlemen in manners and education, who would be addressed as Effendis or Beys, or perhaps as Pashas, who did not hesitate to spread their small Persian carpets in the cabin or on the deck at any hour, and kneel and prostrate themselves, and say their prayers.  Besides these, the whole forward part of the ship was packed with pilgrims (there were four hundred of them) going to Mecca: Turks in white turbans and baggy trousers; and Circassians in long overcoats, made of undressed sheepskins, with tall, shaggy hats, like the bear-skin shakos of Scotch grenadiers. Some of them had their belts stuck thick with knives and pistols, as if they expected to have to fight their way to the tomb of the Prophet. Altogether they were not an attractive set, and yet one could not view, without a certain respect, a body of men animated by a strong religious feeling which impelled them to undertake this long pilgrimage; it requires three months to go and return. Nor could one listen quite unmoved as at different hours of the day, at sunrise, or midday, or sunset, the muezzin climbed to the upper deck, and in a wailing voice called the hour of prayer, and the true believers, standing up, rank on rank, turned their faces towards Mecca, and reverently bowed themselves and worshipped.  On the afternoon of the sixth day we came in sight of a low-lying coast, with not a hill or elevation of any kind rising above the dreary waste, the sea of waters breaking on a sea of sand. The sun sinking in the west showed the lighthouse at Alexandria, but as the channel is narrow and intricate, ships are not allowed to enter after sunset; and so we lay outside all night, but as soon as the morning broke, steamed up and entered the harbor. Here was the same scene as at Constantinople--a crowd of boats around the ship, and boatmen shouting and yelling, jumping over one another in their eagerness to be first, climbing on board, and rushing on every unfortunate traveller as if they would tear him to pieces. But they are not so terrible as they appear, and so it always comes to pass, that whether \"on boards or broken pieces of the ship,\" all come safe to land.  In spite of this wild uproar, it was not without a strange feeling of interest that we first set foot in Africa. A few days before we had touched the soil of Asia, on the other side of the Bosphorus--the oldest of the continents, the cradle of the human race. And now we were in Africa--in Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs, out of which Moses led the Israelites; the land of the Pyramids, the greatest monuments of ancient civilization.  As soon as one comes on shore, he perceives that he is in a different country. The climate is different, the aspects of nature are different, the people are different, the very animals are different. Caravans of camels are moving slowly through the streets, and outside of the city, coming up to its very walls, as if threatening to overwhelm it, is the \"great and terrible\" desert, a vast and billowy plain, whose ever-drifting sands would speedily bury all the works of man, if they were not kept back from destruction by the waters of the Nile, which is at once the creator and preserver of Egypt.  Alexandria, although founded by Alexander the Great, whose name it bears, and therefore more than two thousand years old--and although in its monuments, Cleopatra's Needle and Pompey's Pillar, it carries back the mind to the last of the Ptolemies, the proud daughter of kings, and to her Roman lovers and conquerors--has yet in many parts quite a modern aspect, and is almost a new city. It has felt, more than most places in the East, the influence of European civilization. Commerce is returning to its ancient seats along the Mediterranean, and the harbor of Alexandria is filled with a forest of ships, that reminds one of New York or Liverpool.  But as it becomes more European, it is less Oriental; and though more prosperous, is less picturesque than other parts of Egypt; and so, after a couple of days, we left for Cairo, and now for the first time struck the Nile, which reminds an American traveller of the Missouri, or the lower Mississippi. It is the same broad stream of turbid, yellow waters, flowing between low banks. This is the Great River which takes its rise in the heart of Africa, beyond the equator, at a point so remote that, though the Valley of the Nile was four thousand years ago the seat of the greatest empire of antiquity, yet to"]]]
