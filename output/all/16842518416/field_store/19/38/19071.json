Lewis Cass (1782-1866) had unusual opportunities for contact with the tribesmen. After taking a prominent part in the War of 1812-15, he was for eighteen years governor of Michigan Territory. His contributions to Indian bibliography were a series of articles published in the _North American Review_, xxvi-xxx (1828-30).  Peter Stephen Duponceau (1760-1844) was a Frenchman who came to America during the Revolution. Settling at Philadelphia, he became a member of the American Philosophical Society, and contributed to its _Transactions_ several articles on the structure and grammar of Indian languages.--ED.  [6] Christian Gottfried Nees von Esenbeck (1776-1858), a famous botanist and physician. He first engaged in the practice of medicine, but in 1818 went to Erlangen as professor of botany, the next year being called to Bonn, then being professor at Breslau (1831-52). The number of his published works is considerable.--ED.  [7] Georg August Goldfuss (1782-1848) was born at Bayreuth, and became privatdocent at Erlangen, then professor of zoölogy and mineralogy at Bonn and director of the zoölogical museum.  Robert Göppert (1800-1884) was a botanist and palæontologist. First studying medicine at Breslau and Berlin, he was professor of botany in the university at the former place (1831-39). In 1852 he was chosen director of the botanical gardens at Breslau, where he remained until his death.--ED.  [8] Achille Valenciennes (1794-1864) was a French zoölogist, a friend and fellow-worker with Cuvier, and director of the Paris zoölogical museum.  Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann (1802-41) was for a time professor of zoölogy at Berlin. He founded (1835) _Archivs fur Naturgeschichte_.--ED.      TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE   The author, in his Preface, gives so full an account of the objects and results of his travels in the interior of North America, that it would have been unnecessary for me to prefix any observations of my own, were it not for some circumstances, connected with the translation, which seem to require explanation.  The prospectus of the German original announced that the work would consist of two large quarto volumes, accompanied by a portfolio of above eighty beautifully coloured copper-plates, executed by eminent artists at Paris, from the original drawings. Some specimens of the plates having been brought to London, were so much admired by many competent judges, that Messrs. Ackermann were induced to agree with the Paris publisher for a limited number of copies of the plates; and as it might justly be presumed that the English purchasers would be desirous of having the narrative of the travels, it was resolved to publish a translation compressed into a single volume. By selecting, however, a page of a large size, the translator has been able to retain all the most interesting parts, omitting only minute details of the measurements of animals, &c. All the chapters illustrative of the manners, customs, traditions, and superstitions of the Indians are given without abridgment, and these, as the author justly observes, are by far the most attractive and valuable portions of the work. The papers in the Appendix, giving an account of the plants collected, are also inserted entire, and have been kindly revised by my friend Sir William Hooker.[9]  The principal omission is that of the very extensive vocabularies of the languages of the different Indian tribes.[10] They are written so as to represent the pronunciation in German, and have, in numerous instances, special directions, as thus: kontschue (_on_ as in French, _schue_, short and quick, _e_½). It appeared to be a hopeless and unprofitable task to rewrite these vocabularies, and to represent the true pronunciation in English. Those who are curious in such matters will find many specimens in Mr. Catlin's interesting work.[11]  The numerous Indian proper names are, of course, written in the original as pronounced in German. It has been thought best to leave them unchanged, merely requesting the reader to observe, in general, that the consonants are pronounced as in English; only that _ch_ is guttural, as in the Scotch word _loch_; that _sch_ is pronounced _sh_, and that the vowels have the same sound as in French, _ah_, _a_, _ee_, _o_, _oo_.  The author alludes, in his Preface, to the recent fearful ravages which have been caused among the Indian races by the small-pox. The origin and extent of these ravages will be seen from the following very affecting letter on the subject:     [pg. ix]\"NEW ORLEANS, _June 6, 1838_.--The southern parts of the    United States, particularly Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, are    as healthy as can be wished; there has been no appearance of the    yellow fever, and even at the Havannah only a few isolated cases    have occurred. During the autumn, winter, and spring, the    small-pox has carried off many victims among the whites, and    thousands of the Indians; but it has now wholly disappeared in    the territory of the Union, in consequence of a general    vaccination of persons of all ages. On the other hand, we have,    from the trading posts on the western frontier of the Missouri,    the most frightful accounts of the ravages of the small-pox    among the Indians. The destroying angel has visited the    unfortunate sons of the wilderness with terrors never before    known, and has converted the extensive hunting grounds, as well    as the peaceful settlements of those tribes, into desolate and    boundless cemeteries. The number of the victims within a few    months is estimated at 30,000, and the pestilence is still    spreading. The warlike spirit which but lately animated the    several Indian tribes, and but a few months ago gave reason to    apprehend the breaking-out of a sanguinary war, is broken. The    mighty warriors are now the prey of the greedy wolves of the    prairie, and the few survivors, in mute despair, throw    themselves on the pity of the Whites, who, however, can do but    little to help them. The vast preparations for the protection of    the western frontier are superfluous: another arm has undertaken    the defence of the white inhabitants of the frontier; and the    funeral torch, that lights the red man to his dreary grave, has    become the auspicious star of the advancing settler, and of the    roving trader of the white race.     \"The small-pox was communicated to the Indians by a person who    was on board the steam-boat which went, last summer, up to the    mouth of the Yellow Stone, to convey both the government    presents for the Indians, and the goods for the barter trade of    the fur dealers.[12] The disorder communicated itself to several    of the crew of the steam-boat. The officers gave notice of it to    the Indians, and exerted themselves to the utmost to prevent any    intercourse between them and the vessel; but this was a vain    attempt; for the Indians knew that presents and goods for barter    were come for them, and it would have been impossible to drive    them away from the fort without having recourse to arms. Two    days before the arrival of the steam-boat, an express had been    received at the trading fort, 2000 miles west of St. Louis, with    the melancholy news of the breaking-out of the small-pox on    board; this was immediately communicated to the Indians, with    the most urgent entreaties to keep at a distance; but this was    as good as preaching to the winds. The survivors now lament    their disobedience, and are as submissive as the poor dogs which    look in vain in the prairie for the footsteps of their masters.    The miserable remnants of the Indians implore us not to abandon    them in their misfortune, and promise, if we will take pity on    them, never more to disobey our commands.     \"The disease first broke out about the 15th of June, 1837, in    the village of the Mandans, a few miles below the American fort,    Leavenworth, from which it spread, in all directions, with    unexampled fury.[13] The character of the disease was as    appalling as the rapidity of the propagation. Among the remotest    tribes of the Assiniboins from fifty to one hundred died daily.    The patient, when first seized, complains of dreadful pains in    the head and back, and in a few hours he is dead: the body    immediately turns black, and swells to thrice its natural size.    In vain were hospitals fitted up in Fort Union,[14] and the    whole stock of medicines exhausted. For many weeks together our    workmen did nothing but collect the dead bodies and bury them in    large pits; but since the ground is frozen we are obliged to    throw them into the river. The ravages of the disorder were the    most frightful among the Mandans, where it first broke out. That    once powerful tribe, which, by accumulated disasters, had    already been reduced to 1500 souls, was exterminated, with the    exception of thirty persons. Their neighbours, the Bigbellied    Indians, and the Ricarees, were out on a hunting excursion at    the time of the breaking-out of the disorder, so that it did not    reach them till a month later; yet half the tribe was already    destroyed on the 1st of October, and the disease continued to    spread. Very few of those who were attacked recovered their    health; but when they saw all their relations buried, and the    pestilence still raging with unabated fury among the remainder    of their countrymen, life became a burden to them, and they put    an end to their wretched existence, either with their knives and    muskets, or by precipitating themselves from the summit of the    rock near their settlement. The prairie all around is a vast    field of death, covered with unburied corpses, and spreading,    for miles, pestilence and infection. The Bigbellied Indians and    the Ricarees, lately amounting to 4000 souls, were reduced to    less than the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38784"],["title","Maximilian, Prince of Wied's, Travels in the Interior of North America, (#5)"],["body","alf. The Assiniboins, 9000 in number, roaming    over a hunting territory to the north of the Missouri, as far as    the trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company, are, in the    literal sense of the expression, nearly exterminated. They, as    well as the Crows and Blackfeet, endeavoured to fly in all    directions, but the disease everywhere pursued them. At last    every feeling of mutual compassion and tenderness seems to have    disappeared. Every one avoided the others. Women and children    wandered about in the prairie seeking [pg. x] for a scanty    subsistence. The accounts of the situation of the Blackfeet are    awful. The inmates of above 1000 of their tents are already    swept away. They are the bravest and the most crafty of all the    Indians, dangerous and implacable to their enemies, but faithful    and kind to their friends. But very lately we seriously    apprehended that a terrible war with them was at hand, and that    they would unite the whole of their remaining strength against    the Whites. Every day brought accounts of new armaments, and of    a loudly expressed spirit of vengeance towards the Whites: but    the small-pox cast them down, the brave as well as the feeble;    and those who were once seized by this infection never    recovered. It is affirmed that several bands of warriors, who    were on their march to attack the fort, all perished by the way,    so that not one survived to convey the intelligence to their    tribe. Thus, in the course of a few weeks, their strength and    their courage were broken, and nothing was to be heard but the    frightful wailings of death in the camp. Every thought of war    was dispelled, and the few that are left are as humble as    famished dogs. No language can picture the scene of desolation    which the country presents. In whatever direction we go, we see    nothing but melancholy wrecks of human life. The tents are still    standing on every hill, but no rising smoke announces the    presence of human beings, and no sounds but the croaking of the    raven and the howling of the wolf interrupt the fearful silence.    The above accounts do not complete the terrible intelligence    which we receive. There is scarcely a doubt that the pestilence    will spread to the tribes in and beyond the Rocky Mountains, as    well as to the Indians in the direction of Santa Fé and Mexico.    It seems to be irrevocably written in the book of fate, that the    race of red men shall be wholly extirpated in the land in which    they ruled the undisputed masters, till the rapacity of the    Whites brought to their shores the murderous fire-arms, the    enervating ardent spirits, and the all-destructive pestilence of    the small-pox. According to the most recent accounts, the    number of the Indians who have been swept away by the small-pox,    on the western frontier of the United States, amounts to more    than 60,000.\"[15]  The general correctness of the melancholy details given in the above letter has been confirmed to me by several travellers who have visited these nations since they were desolated by this awful epidemic. The almost total extinction of these tribes greatly enhances the value and importance of the full and interesting particulars imparted by his Highness.       H. EVANS LLOYD.[16]       CHARTERHOUSE SQUARE,      May 1st, 1843.   FOOTNOTES:  [9] Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) was early devoted to the study of natural history, making scientific journeys to Scotland in 1806 and to Iceland in 1809. Later (1814), Hooker prosecuted a nine months' botanical tour on the continent of Europe. The following year he married and settled on his estate where he commenced an herbarium; from 1820 to 1841 he was regius professor of botany at Glasgow, being in 1836 knighted for eminent service to science. From 1841 till his death he was director of Kew Gardens, London. Hooker's interest in American scientific development was marked, and he dispatched many pupils on botanical tours to unknown parts of the new continent.--ED.  [10] Reprinted in our volume xxiv.--ED.  [11] George Catlin was born in Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, in 1796, of a New England family; his mother was a woman of artistic tastes, and had lived on the Indian border. Early in his career, Catlin heard much of the traditions of the aborigines, and thus was unconsciously prepared for his later life work. In 1817 he was sent to study law at Litchfield; returning to Pennsylvania two years later, he practiced in the rural districts until 1823, when he abandoned the law, and going to Philadelphia became an artist. For several years he was employed in painting miniatures and other portraits, going as far as Washington and Albany to execute orders. Having met at the former city a deputation of American Indians, Catlin was imbued with a desire to paint the portraits of these vanishing tribesmen, and in 1832 went west with this purpose in view. Eight years were spent in native lodges and fur-trade camps; then, with a wealth of material widely known as Catlin's Collection, he opened a museum--first in the United States (1837-39), then in London (1840-44). In 1845 he took his collection to Paris, where he remained until expelled by the Revolution of 1848. He thereupon re-opened his London museum, with additional material; but in 1852 became involved in debt, and his collection was shipped to the United States, where it remained neglected until 1879, when it was presented to the National Museum at Washington. Meanwhile Catlin visited South and Central America (1852-57), and resided thereafter in Europe, returning to the United States in 1871 only to die the following year at Jersey City. The work here referred to was _Letters and Notes on the Manners and Customs of the North American Indians_ (New York and London, 1841), more commonly cited by the title of later editions, _Notes of Eight Years' Travels_. In an appendix are several vocabularies of the Mandan, Blackfeet, Arikara, Sioux, and Tuscarora Indians.--ED.  [12] This was the American Fur Company's steamer \"St. Peter's,\" which carried the annual outfit and supplies to the Missouri River forts. Larpenteur, in charge at Fort Union, says that the vessel arrived June 24, 1837. See Elliott Coues, _Forty Years a Fur-Trader on the Upper Missouri_ (New York, 1898), pp. 131-135.--ED.  [13] For the Mandan see Bradbury's _Travels_, in our volume v, pp. 113, 114, note 76. This should be Fort Clark, not Fort Leavenworth--an evident _lapsus calami_. Fort Clark, named for General William Clark, was an American fur-trade post built among the Mandan in 1831. See _post_, chapter xiii, for a detailed description.--ED.  [14] For Fort Union see _post_, chapter xv.--ED.  [15] Authorities differ as to the numbers perishing by the scourge of 1837. H. M. Chittenden, _History of American Fur-Trade of the Far West_ (New York, 1902), p. 627, thinks fifteen thousand a large estimate.--ED.  [16] Hannibal Evans Lloyd (1771-1847), a well-known linguist and translator, especially interested in works of travel and science. His father had been in the Seven Years' War, of which he wrote a history. Early in life the son studied German, and published a grammar and dictionary of that language, as well as an _Englisches Lesebuch_ (Hamburg, 1832) for the use of German students. Lloyd lived for several years in Hamburg, and was present during the French invasion in 1813, of which he afterwards wrote an account. Among his other original works were lives of George IV of England, and Alexander I of Russia. His translations were from Swedish, German, and Italian, having Englished Katzebue's _Voyages_, Orlich's _Travels in India_, and Maximilian's Brazilian travels. Under the signature \"H. E. L.,\" Lloyd was a frequent contributor to the _London Literary Gazette_ (1817-39). His translation of Maximilian's _Travels_ is clear, simple, and straightforward; the German original sustains small loss either of style or meaning, although the translator saw fit in many cases to abbreviate the prince's prolix descriptions, and to eliminate not only the exceedingly valuable linguistic material, but much other scientific matter.--ED.      TRAVELS IN THE INTERIOR OF NORTH AMERICA, IN THE YEARS 1832, 1833, AND 1834  [PART I]      CHAPTER I  VOYAGE TO BOSTON, STAY IN THAT CITY, AND JOURNEY TO NEW YORK, FROM MAY 17TH TO JULY 9TH, 1832     Voyage--Boston--Festival of Independence--The American    inns--Charlestown--Monument on Bunker's Hill--Cambridge--New    England Museum--Pawtucket--Providence--Embark on board the    Boston--Voyage to New York--Fine view of that city.   Voyages to North America are become everyday occurrences, and little more is to be related of them than that you met and saluted ships, had fine or stormy weather, and the like; here, therefore, we shall merely say that our party embarked at Helvoetsluys, on board an American ship, on the 17th of May, in the evening, and on the 24th saw Land's End, Cornwall, vanish in the misty distance, and bade farewell to Europe.  Even when we were in latitude 48° 40´, and for several days afterwards, we had very unfavourable weather and violent storms, which were succeeded, on the 10th of June, by calms. On such days, shoals of dolphins crowded round the ship, and some men got on the bowsprit to throw the harpoon at them. The mate was at length so fortunate as to drive his harpoon through the body of one of these monsters of the deep, an event which was hailed with loud cheers. By the aid of several sailors the heavy prey was drawn upon deck. The animal, after it was wounded, made desperate efforts to free itself, and the harpoon had nearly given way, when the fish was secured by a rope thrown under the pectoral fins.  [pg. 2] On the following day we had some of the flesh dressed as steaks, which we found to be very good; indeed, we preferred them to all other meat. I did not know, at that time, that I should soon find dog's flesh relishing!"]]]
