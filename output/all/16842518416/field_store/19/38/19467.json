Jean crawled on her hands and knees to Alan's side, and when she looked, what she saw made her so angry that she would have sprung to her feet if Alan had not held her down with a fierce grip. The stag was lying by the lake-shore, and a man with the muzzle of his gun still smoking was running toward it from the woods. The man was Angus Niel!  Jean was so astonished that for an instant she could not believe her own eyes. The two children flattened themselves out on their stomachs and watched him pull a boat from its hiding-place among some bushes on the shore, paddle quietly to the spot where the dead stag lay, and load it swiftly into the boat. Then he raced back to the woods again and reappeared, carrying a string of dead rabbits. These also he crowded into the boat, and then, taking up the oars, rowed across the lake to a landing-place on the other side. The children watched him, scarcely breathing in their excitement, until he had unloaded his game from the boat and disappeared into the woods, dragging the body of the stag after him. In a few moments he came back for the rabbits and, having disposed of them in the same mysterious way, returned to the boat.  Then Jean exploded in a fierce whisper. \"The old thief!\" she said, shaking her fist after him. \"He's the poacher himself! That's why he never brings any one before the bailie, though he's always telling about catching them at it! And he making such a fuss because Jock chased the rabbit that was eating up our garden! Oh, oh, oh!\"  She clutched Alan and shook him in her boiling indignation. Alan laughed and shook her back. \"I didn't do it, you little spitfire!\" he whispered, and Jean moaned, \"Oh, I know it, Alan, but I can't catch him and I'm so angry I've just got to do something to somebody.\"  \"Do you know what that old thief does?\" said Alan. \"He sends that game down to the city--to Glasgow, or Edinburgh, or even London, maybe--and gets a lot of money for it! No wonder he tells big stories to make people afraid to go into the woods.\"  \"I hope he won't meet the boys,\" moaned Jean. \"Jock would be sure to let his tongue loose, and then maybe he'd shoot him too!\"  \"Listen,\" said Alan. He gave the pewit's call and waited. It was answered from a point so near that they were startled. They looked in every direction but saw nothing of the boys.  \"Maybe it was a real pewit after all,\" whispered Jean, but just then a tiny pebble struck Alan's cap, and, looking around in the direction from which it came, he saw two freckled faces rise up from behind the rock on the opposite side of the spring.  \"There they are,\" he said, punching Jean and pointing; \"they came up the other side of the burn.\" Then, making a cup of his hands, he called across the stream, \"Did you see him?\" The boys nodded. \"Slip back as fast as you can down that side of the burn,\" Alan said, \"and we'll meet at the fall. Wait at the foot if you get there first. We've got something to show you. Whist, and be quick, for he'll be coming back before long, and this way like as not.\"  Jock and Sandy nodded and disappeared, and Alan and Jean, springing from their hiding-place, hurried as fast as they could down their side of the stream to the trysting-place.     VII. THE CLAN   When Jean and Alan reached the waterfall, they found Jock and Sandy there before them. \"Come over to our side,\" Alan called. The two boys ran further down stream and crossed the brook on stones which stood out of the water, and in a moment more were back again at the foot of the fall.  \"What have you got to show us?\" demanded Jock. \"I hope it's something to eat.\" Jock had bitterly regretted his morning decision to find his food in the forest. The scone which Sandy had brought from home had been divided and eaten long ago; and all four of the children were now so hungry that they could think of nothing else, not even of Angus Niel and their adventures by the lake.  Alan looked cautiously around in every direction. \"Follow me, and keep quiet tongues in your heads,\" he said. Then he disappeared under the fall, and Jean instantly followed him. For a moment Jock and Sandy were as mystified as Jean had been when Alan first found the secret stairway, but it was not long before they, too, saw the hole in the rock, plunged in and, following the winding passage-way, came out upon the top of the rock.  \"There,\" said Alan, beaming with pride, as he displayed his wonderful lair, \"doesn't this beat Robinson Crusoe all to pieces? If he had found a place like this on his desert island, he wouldn't have had to build a stockade or anything.\"  \"It's one of the very caves where Rob Roy hid! I'm sure of it,\" Jock declared with conviction, and Sandy was so overcome with admiration that he turned a back somersault and almost upset Jean, who was coming out of the cave with the basket on her arm.  \"You see,\" said Alan, \"we could stay here a week if we had food enough, and never come down at all. All we'd have to do for water would be to hold a pan under the edge of the fall. There's no way of getting up here except by the secret stair, and that's not easy to find. There never was such a place for fun.\"  Sandy had righted himself by this time and was gazing ecstatically at the basket, which Jean had begun to unpack. \"Losh!\" he cried. \"Look, Jock! Bacon and eggs and scones! Oh, my word!\" Jock gave one look and whooped for joy.  \"Keep still,\" said Alan. \"Angus may be coming back this way, and he has a gun with him. We're safe enough up here, if we keep quiet, but if you go howling around like that, he'll surely hunt for the noise.\"  For a moment they kept quiet and listened, but there was no sound except the noise of the falling waters. \"Huh!\" Sandy snorted, \"he couldn't hear anything, anyway. The roar of the fall hides all the other noises.\"  \"Oh, let's eat!\" begged Jock, caressing his empty stomach and gazing longingly at the food.  \"You can't eat now,\" said Jean; \"the food must be cooked first, and what shall we do for a fire?\"  \"We could make one right here on the rock,\" said Alan, \"if we had something to burn. I've got matches.\"  \"We'll have to get twigs and dry pine-needles and broken branches,\" said Jock, \"and bring them up the secret stair, though it'll be hard work getting them through the narrow places. We ought to have a rope. We could pull a basketful up over the edge of the rock as easy as nothing.\"  \"We'll bring a rope next time,\" said Alan. \"Hurry! I'm starving!\"  The three boys disappeared down the secret stair, and while they were gone, Jean found loose stones, with which she made a support for the frying-pan around a space for the fire. The boys were soon back with plenty of small fuel, and in a short time a bright fire was blazing on the rock and there was a wonderful smell of frying bacon in the air. The boys sat cross-legged around the fire, while Jean turned the bacon and broke the eggs into the sputtering fat.  \"You look just exactly like Tam watching the rabbit-hole,\" laughed Jean. \"I wonder you don't paw the ground and bark!\"  At last the scones were handed out, each one laden with a slice of bacon and a fried egg, and there was blissful silence for some moments.  \"Oh, aren't you glad you didn't die of the measles and miss this?\" Sandy said to Alan, rolling over on his back and waving his legs in the air as he finished his third egg. Alan's mouth was too full for a reply other than a cordial grunt.  \"Why, Sandy Crumpet!\" exclaimed Jean, reprovingly, \"don't you believe heaven is nicer than Scotland?\"  \"Maybe it is,\" Sandy admitted, doubtfully, \"but I like this better than sitting around playing on harps and trumpets the way the angels do.\"  \"Sandy Crumpet played the trumpet,\" howled Jock in derision. \"Indeed and indeed, Sandy, I like this better than having to hear you.\" Then, before Sandy could think of an answer a memory of the catechism crossed his mind, and he added as afterthought, \"How do you ken you're one of the elect, anyway, Sandy Crumpet? If you're not, you'd not be playing on any trumpets, or harps either, but like as not frying in the hot place like that bacon there.\"  Sandy rushed to the defense of his character. \"I'm just as elect as you are, Jock Campbell,\" he said.  This time Jock had no answer ready, and Jean reproved them both. \"Shame on you!\" she said. \"You'll neither one of you get so much as a taste of heaven, I doubt, and you talking like that.\"  \"Where will Angus Niel be going, then, when he dies?\" asked Jock. \"I don't just mind whether there's a chance for thieves, but the Bible says drunkards and such-like stand no chance at all.\"  \"It's not for us to judge,\" said Jean primly, \"but I have my opinion.\"  Alan had been busily eating during this conversation, and now he joined in. \"I say,\" he began, \"I'm not worrying about what will become of Angus Niel after he's dead. I want to know what's going to be done with him right now. We're the only ones that know about this. Are we just going to keep whist, or shall we tell on him?\"  \"Let's tell on him!\" shouted Sandy.  \"Who'll you be telling?\" said Jean with some scorn.  \"Why, the bailie, maybe, or the Auld Laird himself,\" said Sandy.  \"Havers!\" said Jean. \"You're a braw lad to go hobnobbing with the bailie. He'll not believe you, anyway; he's a friend of Angus himself, and, as for the Auld Laird, how would you get hold of him at all, and he far away in London?\"  Sandy subsided, crushed, and then Jock had a bright idea. \"I tell you what we'll do,\" he cried, springing to his feet. \"Let's have a clan, like Rob Roy, and we'll just badger the life out of Angus Niel. We'll never let him know who we are, but keep kim forever stepping and give him no rest. If he thinks somebody's following him up all the time, he'll not sleep easy o' nights!\"  This suggestion was greeted with riotous applause. \"He'd not sleep easy if he knew Jean was after him, I'll go bail,\" laughed Alan.  \"Hooray!\" shouted Sandy, waving his legs frantically. \"What shall"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4086"],["title","The Scotch Twins (#8)"],["body"," call it?\"  \"Let's call it the Rob Roy Clan,\" said Alan.  \"Hooray!\" roared Sandy again.  \"If we're a Clan, we'll have to have a chief,\" said Jean, \"and if the Chief bids us do anything, we'll just have to do it. That's the way it was in the real Rob Roy Clan. Father said so.\"  \"Jock thought of it first. Let him be Chief,\" said Alan.  \"No!\" cried Jean promptly. \"Are you thinking I'll put my head in a bag like that, and he my own brother? 'Deed, I'd never get a lick of work out of him on Saturday if I did! Na, na, lads! Whoever's Chief, it won't be Jock.\"  \"Maybe you'd like to be the Chief yourself,\" retorted Jock, \"but it's enough to be bossed by you at home! Besides, whoever heard of a girl being Chief, anyway?\"  \"Alan can be Chief,\" said Jean, and so the matter was settled.  \"If I'm Chief,\" said Alan, \"you'll all have to swear an oath of fealty to me.\"  \"What's an oath of fealty?\" Jock demanded suspiciously, and Jean added in a shocked voice, \"Alan, you'd never be asking us to take the name of the Lord in vain!\"  \"It's not that kind of an oath,\" laughed Alan. \"You just have to vow to obey the Chief in everything.\" Then an idea popped into his head. \"In a real Clan they are all kinsmen, but here's Sandy, and he's neither Campbell nor McGregor. We'll have to make a blood brother of him before he can join.\"  \"What's a blood brother? How do you make 'em?\" asked Sandy.  \"I'll show you,\" said Alan. He drew his knife from his pocket and while the other three watched him in breathless admiration, he made a little cut in his wrist and immediately passed the knife to Jock. \"You do the same,\" he commanded.  Jock obeyed his Chief and passed the knife to Jean, who promptly followed his example.  \"Now, Sandy,\" said Alan.  Sandy hated the sight of blood, and he was a little pale under his freckles as he shut his eyes and jabbed himself gingerly with the point. Then Alan took a drop of blood from each wrist and mingled them with a drop from Sandy's.  \"Now, Sandy,\" he said, as he stirred the compound into a gory paste, \"you repeat after me, 'My foot is on my native heath, my name it is McGregor.'\" Sandy obeyed with solemnity, and, this important ceremony over, Alan pronounced him a member of the Clan in good and regular standing.  Then, by the Chief's orders, Jean, Jock, and Sandy, each in turn placed their hands under Alan's hand, while they promised to obey him without question in all matters pertaining to the Clan.  \"Only,\" said Jean, \"you mustn't tell us to do anything wrong.\"  \"I won't,\" promised Alan. And so the Rob Roy Clan came into being.  Alan took command at once. \"We must have a sign,\" he said. \"Just like Clan Alpine in 'The Lady of the Lake.' Go, my henchmen,\" he cried, striking a noble attitude, and waving his hand toward the forest, \"bring hither sprays of the Evergreen Pine, and we'll stick 'em in our bonnets just like Roderick Dhu and his men. Roderick Vich Alpine Dhu, ho! iero!\"  The two boys instantly disappeared down the hole in the rock on this errand, leaving Jean and Alan to guard the cave.     VIII. THE POACHERS   While all these things were happening, Angus Niel had returned from his errand across the little lake, and was making his way slowly toward home, following the course of the stream. As he came near the fall he stopped and sniffed. There was certainly a most appetizing smell of bacon in the air!  \"It can't be!\" he said aloud to himself. He sniffed again, and his face turned purple with rage. \"Meat,\" he snorted, \"as I live! The bold rascals! Poaching in broad daylight and cooking their game right under my nose!\" It wasn't under his nose at all, of course, for the rock was far above him, and it wasn't game either.  \"I'll soon cure them of that trick,\" he muttered, as he climbed silently over the rocks and gazed searchingly about. It was not long before he caught sight of a thin curl of blue smoke rising from the top of the rock.  \"Aha!\" he growled under his breath, \"I've got you now, my bold gentlemen! I'll teach you to flaunt your thefts in the face of the Laird's own gamekeeper, once I get my hands on you!\" At once he began nosing about the rocks in search of the path by which the poachers had climbed the cliff.  Meanwhile Sandy and Jock had found the sprays of the Evergreen Pine and were on their way back to the cave with them, when Jock suddenly seized Sandy by the arm and ducked down behind a boulder. There, not a hundred feet away, stood Angus Niel gazing up at the top of the rock! His back was toward them, and the noise of the waterfall had drowned out the sound of voices, or they surely would not have escaped his notice. As it was, they slipped behind the fall, whisked into the hole, and began climbing the secret stair like two frightened squirrels. An instant later they startled Alan and Jean, who were in the cave, by dashing in after them on all fours.  \"What on earth is the matter?\" cried Jean.  \"Matter, indeed!\" gasped Jock, out of breath. \"Angus Niel is down there, and he's seen the smoke! He almost saw us, but we just gave him the slip and got by.\"  \"Keep out of sight, all of you,\" commanded the Chief, \"and leave him to me.\"  The obedient Clan flattened themselves against the back of the cave, while Alan crept to the edge of the rock on his stomach like a lizard, and, lying there, was able to peep through the thick screen of leaves and see what was going on below. The gamekeeper was still scrambling over the rocks and looking, as Alan said afterward, \"for all the world like a dog who had lost the trail and was trying to find it again.\"  As the lookout was well screened, Alan soon allowed the rest of the Clan to join him, and Angus Niel little guessed, as he prowled about over the rocks, that every move was watched from above. Despairing of finding the path, he decided at last to get up a tree and make an observation. He selected a large pine which grew near the cave and began to climb.  So long as he stood on the ground, the children knew it was impossible for Angus to see them, but when he began to climb, they scuttled back into the cave as fast as they could go.  Climbing is hard work for a fat man, and the gamekeeper found himself covered with pitch before he had gone more than halfway up, but he puffed on in spite of difficulties and at last reached a point from which he could look directly across the surface of the rock, but from which the cave was entirely hidden behind a projection in the wall of the cliff.  Angus saw what he supposed to be the whole shelf of the rock, and he saw that there was no one there. He could see the fire and the frying-pan, the egg shells lying about, and even the portion of bacon that Jean had not cooked. They were all in full view, but apparently the poachers had gone away into the woods, leaving their airy camp deserted. There was no one there; of that he felt, certain.  \"I'll just give'em a surprise,\" thought the gamekeeper to himself. \"If they found a way up, I can, too. I'll help myself to a snack of that bacon, and if they come back and find me--well, I have my gun with me and I don't like being interrupted at my meals.\"  He backed down the tree like a fat cat, and made a desperate search for the path, and this time he actually succeeded in finding it. He chuckled to himself as he plunged into the passage and began to climb. He had gone about a third of the way up, when he reached the narrowest point of the channel and tried to force himself through, but the space was so small that no matter how much he tried, he could not get by. His gun was in his way too, but he could not leave it below, as that would be putting it into the hands of the poachers if they should return too soon.  In vain he twisted and squirmed, he could get no farther, and moreover he was afraid the gun might go off by accident in his struggles. When he found that he could not possibly go up, he decided to go down; but he found, to his horror, that he couldn't do that either. There he stuck, and an angrier man than Angus Niel it would have been hard to find. A projecting rock punched him in the stomach, and when he pressed back against the rock behind him, to free himself, he scraped the skin off his back. Casting prudence to the winds, he howled with pain and rage, and the sound, carried up through the narrow passage, echoed in the cave like the roar of a lion.  The children, meanwhile, had kept in hiding, and when they heard these blood-curdling sounds, they at first did not know what caused them, because, of course, they could not see what was happening below, but they knew very soon that they were not made by a wild animal because wild animals do not swear.  \"It's Angus, stuck in the secret stairway,\" Alan said, smothering his laughter. \"He's too fat to get through!\" He crept to the edge and peeped down the hole. There, far below, he could see the top of Angus's head and the muzzle of his gun.  The Chief was a boy of great presence of mind. He backed hastily away from the hole and ran to the fall, snatching up the pan as he passed. This he filled with water and, rushing back, he instantly sent a small deluge down upon the head of the hapless Angus.  The gamekeeper was dumbfounded by this new attack. Had he not with his own eyes seen that the rocky shelf was empty? How, then, could this thing be? He rolled his eyes upward, but there was no one in sight. He had heard all his life tales of witches and water cows, of spells cast upon people by fairies, of their being borne away by them into mountain caverns and held as prisoners for years and years; and he made up his mind that such a fate had now befallen him.  Firmly convinced that he was the victim of enchantment, he became palsied with terror, arid began to plead with the unseen tormentors who he believed held him in thrall. \"Only leave me loose, dear good little people,\" he howled, \"and I'll never, never trouble you more!\"  At this point Alan, shaking with mirth, sent down another panful of water, and Angus,"]]]
