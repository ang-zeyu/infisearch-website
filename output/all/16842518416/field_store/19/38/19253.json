Yet I wouldn't force you, nor be heard over you, nor shut up; nor doom you through your fall; nor through your coming out from light into darkness; nor yet through your coming from the garden into this land.  14 For I made you of the light; and I willed to bring out children of light from you and like to you.  15 But you did not keep My commandment one day; until I had finished the creation and blessed everything in it.  16 Then, concerning the tree, I commanded you not to eat of it.  Yet I knew that Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive you.  17 So I made known to you by means of the tree, not to come near him. And I told you not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor yet to sit under it, nor to yield to it.  18 Had I not been and spoken to you, O Adam, concerning the tree, and had I left you without a commandment, and you had sinned--it would have been an offence on My part, for not having given you any order; you would turn around and blame Me for it.  19 But I commanded you, and warned you, and you fell.  So that My creatures cannot blame Me; but the blame rests on them alone.  20 And, O Adam, I have made the day so that you and your descendants can work and toil in it.  And I have made the night for them to rest in it from their work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by night and look for their food.  21 But little of darkness now remains, O Adam, and daylight will soon appear.\"     Chapter XIV - The earliest prophesy of the coming of Christ.  1 Then Adam said to God: \"O Lord, take You my soul, and let me not see this gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no darkness.\"  2 But God the Lord said to Adam, \"Indeed I say to you, this darkness will pass from you, every day I have determined for you, until the fulfillment of My covenant; when I will save you and bring you back again into the garden, into the house of light you long for, in which there is no darkness*.  I will bring you to it--in the kingdom of heaven.\"  3 Again said God to Adam, \"All this misery that you have been made to take on yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from the hand of Satan, and will not save you.  4 But I will.  When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become flesh of your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which you suffer, then the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of your descendants.  5 And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one of the sons of men, in order to save you.\"  6 And God ceased to commune with Adam.   * Reference: John 12:46     Chapter XV - Adam and Eve grieve over the suffering of God to save them from their sins.  1 Then Adam and Eve cried and sorrowed by reason of God's word to them, that they should not return to the garden until the fulfillment of the days decreed on them; but mostly because God had told them that He should suffer for their salvation.     Chapter XVI - The first sunrise.  Adam and Eve think it is a fire coming to burn them.  1 After this, Adam and Eve continued to stand in the cave, praying and crying, until the morning dawned on them.  2 And when they saw the light returned to them, they retrained from fear, and strengthened their hearts.  3 Then Adam began to come out of the cave.  And when he came to the mouth of it, and stood and turned his face towards the east, and saw the sunrise in glowing rays, and felt the heat thereof on his body, he was afraid of it, and thought in his heart that this flame came forth to plague him.  4 He then cried and beat his chest, then he fell on the ground on his face and made his request, saying:--  5 \"O Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take away my life from the earth.\"  6 For he thought the sun was God.  7 Because while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and the sound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the brilliant light of the sun, neither did its flaming heat touch his body.  8 Therefore he was afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it reached him.  He thought God meant to plague him therewith all the days He had decreed for him.  9 For Adam also said in his thoughts, as God did not plague us with darkness, behold, He has caused this sun to rise and to plague us with burning heat.  10 But while he was thinking like this in his heart, the Word of God came to him and said:--  11 \"O Adam, get up on your feet.  This sun is not God; but it has been created to give light by day, of which I spoke to you in the cave saying, 'that the dawn would come, and there would be light by day.'  12 But I am God who comforted you in the night.\"  13 And God ceased to commune with Adam.     Chapter XVII - The Chapter of the Serpent.  1 The Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and went towards the garden.  2 But as they went near it, before the western gate, from which Satan came when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the serpent that became Satan coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and wiggling on its breast on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell on it from God.  3 And whereas before the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts, now it was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all, and it crept on its breast and went on its belly.  4 And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed, and was become the ugliest of them all.  Instead of feeding on the best food, now it turned to eat the dust.  Instead of living, as before, in the best places, now it lived in the dust.  5 And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of which stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them.  6 And, again, whereas it lived in one beautiful home, to which all other animals came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also of the same; now, after it had become venomous, by reason of God's curse, all beasts fled from its home, and would not drink of the water it drank; but fled from it.     Chapter XVIII - The mortal combat with the serpent.  1 When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head, stood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, acted like it would kill them.  2 It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by, cried because he had no stick in his hand with which to hit the serpent, and did not know how to put it to death.  3 But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and held it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said to him:--  4 \"O Adam, because of you and of Eve, I am slippery, and go on my belly.\"  Then with its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and squeezed them, and tried to kill them.  5 But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and raised them up.  6 Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said to it, \"The first time I made you slick, and made you to go on your belly; but I did not deprive you of speech.  7 This time, however, you will be mute, and you and your race will speak no more; because, the first time My creatures were ruined because of  you, and this time you tried to kill them.\"  8 Then the serpent was struck mute, and was no longer able to speak.  9 And a wind blew down from heaven by the command of God and carried away the serpent from Adam and Eve, and threw it on the seashore where it landed in India.     Chapter XIX - Beasts made subject to Adam.  1 But Adam and Eve cried before God.  And Adam said to Him:--  2 \"O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to you, my Lord, the beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from the earth.\"  3 Then Adam, because of what had happened to him, beat his chest and fell on the ground like a corpse.  Then the Word of God came to him, who raised him, and said to him,  4 \"O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt you; because I have made the beasts and other moving things come to you in the cave. I did not let the serpent come with them because it might have risen against you and made you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into your hearts.  5 For I knew that the accursed one is wicked; therefore I would not let it come near you with the other beasts.  6 But now strengthen your heart and fear not.  I am with you to the end of the days I have determined on you.\"     Chapter XX - Adam wishes to protect Eve.  1 Then Adam cried and said, \"O God, take us away to some other place, where the serpent can not come near us again, and rise against us.  For fear that it might find Your handmaid Eve alone and kill her; for its eyes are hideous and evil.\"  2 But God said to Adam and Eve, \"From now on, don't be afraid, I will not let it come near you; I have driven it away from you, from this mountain; neither will I leave in it the ability to hurt you.\"  3 Then Adam and Eve worshipped before God and gave Him thanks, and praised Him for having delivered them from death.     Chapter XXI - Adam and Eve attempt suicide.  1 Then Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.  2 And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they sweated from the heat, and cried before the Lord.  3 But the place where they cried was close to a high mountain, facing the western gate of the garden.  4 Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that mountain; his face was torn and his flesh was ripped; he lost a lot of blood and was close to death.  5 Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain crying over him, thus lying.  6 And she said, \"I don't wish to live after him; for all that he did to himself was through me.\"  7 Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and ripped by stones; and remained lying as dead.  8 But the merciful God, who looks over His creatures, looked at Adam and Eve as they lay dead, and He sent His Word to them, and raised them.  9 And said to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],["title","The First Book of Adam and Eve (#4)"],["body","Adam, \"O Adam, all this misery which you have brought on yourself, will have no affect against My rule, neither will it alter the covenant of the 5, 500 years.\"     Chapter XXII - Adam in a gracious mood.  1 Then Adam said to God, \"I dry up in the heat, I am faint from walking, and I don't want to be in this world.  And I don't know when You will take me out of it to rest.\"  2 Then the Lord God said to him, \"O Adam, it cannot be now, not until you have ended your days.  Then shall I bring you out of this miserable land.\"  3 And Adam said to God, \"While I was in the garden I knew neither heat, nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now since I came to this land, all this affliction has come over me.  4 Then God said to Adam, \"So long as you were keeping My commandment, My light and My grace rested on you.  But when you transgressed My commandment, sorrow and misery came to you in this land.\"  5 And Adam cried and said, \"O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither punish me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; for we, of our own will, transgressed Your commandment, and ignored Your law, and tried to become gods like you, when Satan the enemy deceived us.\"  6 Then God said again to Adam, \"Because you have endured fear and trembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading and walking about, going on this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this on Myself in order to save you.\"     Chapter XXIII - Adam and Eve strengthen themselves and make the first altar ever built.  1 Then Adam cried more and said, \"O God, have mercy on me, so far as to take on yourself, that which I will do.\"  2 But God withdrew His Word from Adam and Eve.  3 Then Adam and Eve stood on their feet; and Adam said to Eve, \"Strengthen yourself, and I also will strengthen myself.\" And she strengthened herself, as Adam told her.  4 Then Adam and Eve took stones and placed them in the shape of an altar; and they took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with which they wiped, from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.  5 But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together with the dust with which it was mingled and offered it on the altar as an offering to God.  6 Then Adam and Eve stood under the Altar and cried, thus praying to God, \"Forgive us our trespass* and our sin, and look at us with Thine eye of mercy.  For when we were in the garden our praises and our hymns went up before you without ceasing.  7 But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was not longer ours, nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts, nor sweet thoughts, nor just counsels, nor long discernment, nor upright feelings, neither is our bright nature left us.  But our body is changed from the likeness in which it was at first, when we were created.  8 Yet now look at our blood which is offered on these stones, and accept it at our hands, like the praise we used to sing to you at first, when in the garden.\"  9 And Adam began to make more requests of God.   * ORIGINAL OF THE LORD'S PRAYER SAID TO BE USED ABOUT 150 YEARS BEFORE OUR LORD: Our Father, Who art in Heaven, be gracious unto us, O Lord our God, hallowed be Your Name, and let the remembrance of Thee be glorified Heaven above and upon earth here below.  Let Your kingdom reign over us now and forever.  The Holy Men of old said remit and forgive unto all men whatsoever they have done unto me. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil thing; for Thine is the kingdom and Thou shalt reign in glory forever and forevermore, AMEN.     Chapter XXIV - A vivid prophecy of the life and death of Christ.  1 Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked at Adam and Eve, and at their blood, which they had held up as an offering to Him; without an order from Him for so doing.  But He wondered at them; and accepted their offerings.  2 And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their offering.  3 He smelled the sweet savor of their offering, and showed them mercy.  4 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, as you have shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh of your descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die.  And as you built an altar, so also will I make for you an altar of the earth; and as you offered your blood on it, so also will I offer My blood on an altar on the earth.  5 And as you sued for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I make My blood forgiveness of sins, and erase transgressions in it.  6 And now, behold, I have accepted your offering, O Adam, but the days of the covenant in which I have bound you are not fulfilled.  When they are fulfilled, then will I bring you back into the garden.  7 Now, therefore, strengthen your heart; and when sorrow comes over you, make Me an offering, and I will be favorable to you.\"     Chapter XXV - God represented as merciful and loving.  The establishing of worship.  1 But God knew that Adam believed he should frequently kill himself and make an offering to Him of his blood.  2 Therefore He said to him, \"O Adam, don't ever kill yourself like this again, by throwing yourself down from that mountain.\"  3 But Adam said to God, \"I was thinking to put an end to myself at once, for having transgressed Your commandments, and for my having come out of the beautiful garden; and for the bright light of which You have deprived me; and for the praises which poured forth from my mouth without ceasing, and for the light that covered me.  4 Yet of Your goodness, O God, do not get rid of me altogether; but be favorable to me every time I die, and bring me to life.  5 And thereby it will be made known that You are a merciful God, who does not want anyone to perish; who loves not that one should fall; and who does not condemn any one cruelly, badly, and by whole destruction.\"  6 Then Adam remained silent.  7 And the Word of God came to him, and blessed him, and comforted him, and covenanted with him, that He would save him at the end of the days determined for him.  8 This, then, was the first offering Adam made to God; and so it became his custom to do.     Chapter XXVI - A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15). The fall of night.  1 Then Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures where they lived.  But when they got closer to it and saw it from a distance, heavy sorrow fell on Adam and Eve when they looked at it.  2 Then Adam said to Eve, \"When we were on the mountain we were comforted by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that came from the east shown over us.  3 But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shown over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come over us.  4 And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, in which darkness covers us, so that we are separated from each other; and you can not see me, neither can I see you.\"  5 When Adam had said these words, they cried and spread their hands before God; for they were full of sorrow.  6 And they prayed to God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so that darkness would not return to them, and that they wouldn't have to go under this covering of rock.  And they wished to die rather than see the darkness.  7 Then God looked at Adam and Eve and at their great sorrow, and at all they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the misery that came over them in a strange land.  8 Therefore God was not angry with them; nor impatient with them; but he was patient and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He had created.  9 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"Adam, as for the sun, if I were to take it and bring it to you, days, hours, years and months would all stop, and the covenant I have made with you, would never be fulfilled.  10 But then you would be deserted and stuck in a perpetual plague, and you would never be saved.  11 Yes, rather, bear long and calm your soul while you live night and day; until the fulfillment of the days, and the time of My covenant is come.  12 Then shall I come and save you, O Adam, for I do not wish that you be afflicted.  13 And when I look at all the good things in which you lived, and why you came out of them, then would I willingly show you mercy.  14 But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth; otherwise I would have brought you back into the garden.  15 When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show you and your descendants mercy, and bring you into a land of gladness, where there is neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness, and light that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden that shall never pass away.\"  16 And God said again to Adam, \"Be patient and enter the cave, for the darkness, of which you were afraid, shall only be twelve hours long; and when ended, light shall come up.\"  17 Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped before Him, and their hearts were comforted.  They returned into the cave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave their body.  18 And Adam and Eve stood praying until the darkness of night came over them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.  19 And they remained standing in prayer.     Chapter XXVII - The second tempting of Adam and Eve.  The devil takes on the form of a beguiling light.  1 When Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued in prayer, and how God communed with them, and comforted them, and how He had accepted their offering--Satan made an apparition.  2 He began with transforming his hosts; in his hands was a flashing fire, and they were in a great light.  3 He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave because he could not"]]]
