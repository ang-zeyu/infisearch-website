Yet, though I tried, I could not keep my eyes closed.  I opened them to watch the Rube.  I knew Spears felt the same as I, for he was blowing like a porpoise and muttering to himself:  \"Mebee the Rube won't last an' I've no one to put in!\"  The Rube pitched with heavy, violent effort. He had still enough speed to be dangerous.  But after the manner of ball players Shultz and the coachers mocked him.  \"Take all you can,\" called Ellis to Shultz.  Every pitch lessened the Rube's strength and these wise opponents knew it.  Likewise the Rube himself knew, and never had he shown better head work than in this inning.  If he were to win, he must be quick.  So he wasted not a ball.  The first pitch and the second, delivered breast high and fairly over the plate, beautiful balls to hit, Shultz watched speed by.  He swung hard on the third and the crippled Ashwell dove for it in a cloud of dust, got a hand in front of it, but uselessly, for the hit was safe.  The crowd cheered that splendid effort.  Carl marched to bat, and he swung his club over the plate as if he knew what to expect.  \"Come on, Rube!\" he shouted.  Wearily, doggedly, the Rube whirled, and whipped his arm.  The ball had all his old glancing speed and it was a strike. The Rube was making a tremendous effort. Again he got his body in convulsive motion--two strikes!  Shultz had made no move to run, nor had Carl made any move to hit.  These veterans were waiting.  The Rube had pitched five strikes--could he last?  \"Now, Carl!\" yelled Ellis, with startling suddenness, as the Rube pitched again.  Crack!  Carl placed that hit as safely through short as if he had thrown it.  McCall's little legs twinkled as he dashed over the grass. He had to head off that hit and he ran like a streak.  Down and forward he pitched, as if in one of his fierce slides, and he got his body in front of the ball, blocking it, and then he rolled over and over.  But he jumped up and lined the ball to Bogart, almost catching Shultz at third-base.  Then, as Mac tried to walk, his lame leg buckled under him, and down he went, and out.  \"Call time,\" I called to Carter.  \"McCall is done....  Myers, you go to left an' for Lord's sake play ball!\"  Stringer and Bogart hurried to Mac and, lifting him up and supporting him between them with his arms around their shoulders, they led him off amid cheers from the stands.  Mac was white with pain.  \"Naw, I won't go off the field.  Leave me on the bench,\" he said. \"Fight 'em now.  It's our game.  Never mind a couple of runs.\"  The boys ran back to their positions and Carter called play.  Perhaps a little delay had been helpful to the Rube.  Slowly he stepped into the box and watched Shultz at third and Carl at second. There was not much probability of his throwing to catch them off the base, but enough of a possibility to make them careful, so he held them close.  The Rube pitched a strike to Manning, then another.  That made eight strikes square over the plate that inning.  What magnificent control! It was equaled by the implacable patience of those veteran Bisons. Manning hit the next ball as hard as Carl had hit his.  But Mullaney plunged down, came up with the ball, feinted to fool Carl, then let drive to Gregg to catch the fleeting Shultz. The throw went wide, but Gregg got it, and, leaping lengthwise, tagged Shultz out a yard from the plate.  One out.  Two runners on bases.  The bleachers rose and split their throats.  Would the inning never end?  Spears kept telling himself:  \"They'll score, but we'll win.  It's our game!\"  I had a sickening fear that the strange confidence that obsessed the Worcester players had been blind, unreasoning vanity.  \"Carl will steal,\" muttered Spears.  \"He can't be stopped.\"  Spears had called the play.  The Rube tried to hold the little base-stealer close to second, but, after one attempt, wisely turned to his hard task of making the Bisons hit and hit quickly.  Ellis let the ball pass; Gregg made a perfect throw to third; Bogart caught the ball and moved like a flash, but Carl slid under his hands to the bag. Manning ran down to second.  The Rube pitched again, and this was his tenth ball over the plate. Even the Buffalo players evinced eloquent appreciation of the Rube's defence at this last stand.  Then Ellis sent a clean hit to right, scoring both Carl and Manning.  I breathed easier, for it seemed with those two runners in, the Rube had a better chance.  Treadwell also took those two runners in, the Rube had a way those Bisons waited.  They had their reward, for the Rube's speed left him.  When he pitched again the ball had control, but no shoot.  Treadwell hit it with all his strength.  Like a huge cat Ashwell pounced upon it, ran over second base, forcing Ellis, and his speedy snap to first almost caught Treadwell.  Score 8 to 7.  Two out.  Runner on first.  One run to tie.  In my hazy, dimmed vision I saw the Rube's pennant waving from the flag-pole.  \"It's our game!\" howled Spears in my ear, for the noise from the stands was deafening. \"It's our pennant!\"  The formidable batting strength of the Bisons had been met, not without disaster, but without defeat.  McKnight came up for Buffalo and the Rube took his weary swing.  The batter made a terrific lunge and hit the ball with a solid crack It lined for center.  Suddenly electrified into action, I leaped up. That hit!  It froze me with horror.  It was a home-run.  I saw Stringer fly toward left center. He ran like something wild.  I saw the heavy Treadwell lumbering round the bases.  I saw Ashwell run out into center field.  \"Ah-h!\"  The whole audience relieved its terror in that expulsion of suspended breath. Stringer had leaped high to knock down the ball, saving a sure home-run and the game.  He recovered himself, dashed back for the ball and shot it to Ash.  When Ash turned toward the plate, Treadwell was rounding third base.  A tie score appeared inevitable.  I saw Ash's arm whip and the ball shoot forward, leveled, glancing, beautiful in its flight.  The crowd saw it, and the silence broke to a yell that rose and rose as the ball sped in. That yell swelled to a splitting shriek, and Treadwell slid in the dust, and the ball shot into Gregg's hands all at the same instant.  Carter waved both arms upwards.  It was the umpire's action when his decision went against the base-runner.  The audience rolled up one great stentorian cry.  \"Out!\"  I collapsed and sank back upon the bench.  My confused senses received a dull roar of pounding feet and dinning voices as the herald of victory. I felt myself thinking how pleased Milly would be. I had a distinct picture in my mind of a white cottage on a hill, no longer a dream, but a reality, made possible for me by the Rube's winning of the pennant.    THE RUBE'S HONEYMOON  \"He's got a new manager.  Watch him pitch now!\"  That was what Nan Brown said to me about Rube Hurtle, my great pitcher, and I took it as her way of announcing her engagement.  My baseball career held some proud moments, but this one, wherein I realized the success of my matchmaking plans, was certainly the proudest one.  So, entirely outside of the honest pleasure I got out of the Rube's happiness, there was reason for me to congratulate myself. He was a transformed man, so absolutely renewed, so wild with joy, that on the strength of it, I decided the pennant for Worcester was a foregone conclusion, and, sure of the money promised me by the directors, Milly and I began to make plans for the cottage upon the hill.  The Rube insisted on pitching Monday's game against the Torontos, and although poor fielding gave them a couple of runs, they never had a chance.  They could not see the ball.  The Rube wrapped it around their necks and between their wrists and straight over the plate with such incredible speed that they might just as well have tried to bat rifle bullets.  That night I was happy.  Spears, my veteran captain, was one huge smile; Radbourne quietly assured me that all was over now but the shouting; all the boys were happy.  And the Rube was the happiest of all.  At the hotel he burst out with his exceeding good fortune.  He and Nan were to be married upon the Fourth of July!  After the noisy congratulations were over and the Rube had gone, Spears looked at me and I looked at him.  \"Con,\" said he soberly, \"we just can't let him get married on the Fourth.\"  \"Why not?  Sure we can.  We'll help him get married.  I tell you it'll save the pennant for us. Look how he pitched today!  Nan Brown is our salvation!\"  \"See here, Con, you've got softenin' of the brain, too.  Where's your baseball sense?  We've got a pennant to win.  By July Fourth we'll be close to the lead again, an' there's that three weeks' trip on the road, the longest an' hardest of the season.  We've just got to break even on that trip.  You know what that means.  If the Rube marries Nan--what are we goin' to do?  We can't leave him behind.  If he takes Nan with us--why it'll be a honeymoon!  An' half the gang is stuck on Nan Brown!  An' Nan Brown would flirt in her bridal veil! ...  Why Con, we're up against a worse proposition than ever.\"  \"Good Heavens! Cap.  You're right,\" I groaned.  \"I never thought of that.  We've got to postpone the wedding....  How on earth can we? I've heard her tell Milly that.  She'll never consent to it.  Say, this'll drive me to drink.\"  \"All I got to say is this, Con.  If the Rube takes his wife on that trip it's goin' to be an all-fired hummer.  Don't you forget that.\"  \"I'm not likely to.  But, Spears, the point is this--will the Rube win his games?\"  \"Figurin' from his work today, I'd gamble he'll never lose another game.  It ain't that.  I'm thinkin' of what the gang will do to him an' Nan on the cars an' at the hotels.  Oh! Lord, Con, it ain't possible to stand for that honeymoon trip! Just think!\"  \"If the worst comes to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],["title","The Children's Life of the Bee (#0)"],["body","http://www.freeliterature.org (From images generously made available by the Internet Archive)      THE CHILDREN'S LIFE OF THE BEE  BY  MAURICE MAETERLINCK   SELECTED AND ARRANGED BY  ALFRED SUTRO AND HERSCHEL WILLIAMS   ILLUSTRATED BY  EDWARD J.

It was many years ago, in a large village of Dutch Flanders, the sweet and pleasant country that rejoices in brilliant flowers; a country that gladly spreads out before us, as so many pretty toys, her illuminated gables and wagons and towers; her cupboards and clocks that gleam at the end of the passage; her little trees marshaled in line along quays and canal-banks, waiting, one almost might think, for some splendid procession to pass; her boats and her barges with sculptured sterns, her flower-like doors and windows, her spotless dams and many-coloured drawbridges; and her little varnished houses, bright as new pottery, from which bell-shaped dames come forth, all a-glitter with silver and gold, to milk the cows in the white-hedged fields, or spread the linen on flowery lawns that are cut into patterns of oval and lozenge and are most amazingly green.  To this spot an aged philosopher had retired, having become a little weary; and here he had built his refuge. His happiness lay all in the beauties of his garden; and best-loved, and visited most often, were the bee-hives. There were twelve of them, twelve domes of straw; and some he had painted a bright pink, and some a clear yellow, but most were a tender blue, for he had noticed the fondness of the bees for this color. These hives stood against the wall of the house, in the angle formed by one of those pleasant and graceful Dutch kitchens whose earthenware dresser, all bright with copper and brass, was reflected through the open door on to the peaceful water of the canal. And the water, carrying these familiar images beneath its curtain of poplars, led one's eyes to a calm horizon of meadows and of mills.  Here, as in all places, the hives lent a new meaning to the flowers and the silence, the balm of the air and the rays of the sun. One seemed to have drawn very near to all that was happiest in nature. One was content to sit down and rest at this radiant cross-road, along which the busy and tuneful bearers of all country perfumes were incessantly passing from dawn until dusk. One heard the musical voice of the garden, whose loveliest hours seemed to rejoice and to sing of their gladness. One came here, to the school of the bees, to be taught how nature is always at work, always scheming and planning; and to learn too the lesson of whole-hearted labor which is always to benefit others.   In order to follow, as simply as possible, the life of the bees through the year, we will take a hive that awakes in the Spring and duly starts on its labors; and then we shall meet, in their order, all the great events of the bees. These are, first of all, the formation and departure of the swarm; then, the foundation of the new city, the birth and flight of the young queens, the massacre of the males, and, last of all, the return of the sleep of winter. We will try to give the reasons for each event, and to show the laws and habits that bring it about; and so, when we have arrived at the end of the bees' short year, which extends only from April to the last days of September, we shall have gazed on all the mysteries of the palace of honey.  Before we knock at the door, and let our inquisitive glance travel round, it need merely be said that the hive is composed of a queen, who is the mother of all her people; of thousands of female worker-bees, who are neuters or spinsters; and, finally, of some hundreds of males, who never do any work, and are known as drones.   When for the first time we take the cover off a hive we cannot help some feeling of fear, as though we were looking at something not meant for our eyes, something alarming and frightening. We have always thought of the bee as rather a dangerous creature. There is the distressful recollection of its sting, which produces so peculiar a pain that one knows not with what to compare it: a sort of dreadful dryness, as though a flame of the desert had scorched the wounded limb; and one asks oneself whether these daughters of the sun may not have distilled a dazzling poison from their father's rays, in order to defend the treasure which they have gathered during his shining hours.  There is no doubt that if some person, who neither knows nor respects the habits of the bee, were suddenly to fling open the hive, this would turn itself immediately into a burning-bush of heroism and fury; but the slight amount of skill needed to deal with the matter can be readily acquired. Let but a little smoke be deftly applied, let us be gentle and careful in our movements, and the heavily-armed workers will permit themselves to be robbed without the least thought of using their sting. It is not the fact, as some people have stated, that the bees recognize their owner, nor have they any fear of man; but, when the smoke reaches them, when they become aware of what is happening, so quietly and without any haste or disturbance, they imagine that this is not the attack of an enemy against whom any defense is possible, but that it is some natural catastrophe, to which they will do well to submit. Instead of vainly struggling, therefore, their one thought is to safeguard their future; and they rush at once to their reserves of honey, into which they eagerly plunge themselves in order to possess the material for starting a new city immediately, no matter where, should the old one be destroyed or they compelled to abandon it.  A person who knows nothing of bees will be a little disappointed the first time he looks into a hive. Let us say that it is an observation-hive, made of glass, with black curtains and shutters and only one comb, thus enabling the spectator to study both sides. These hives can be placed in a drawing-room or a library without any inconvenience or danger. The bees that live in the one I have in my study in Paris are able--even in that great city--to do their own marketing, as it were--in other words, to find the food they require--and to prosper. You will have been told, when you are shown this little glass box, that it is the home of a most extraordinary activity; that it is governed by a number of wise laws, that it enshrines deep mysteries; and all you will see is a mass of little, reddish groups, somewhat resembling roasted coffee-berries or bunches of raisins, all huddled up against the glass. They look more dead than alive; their movements are slow, and seem confused and without any purpose. We ask ourselves, can these be the dazzling creatures we had seen, but a moment ago, flashing and sparkling as they darted among the pearls and the gold of a thousand wide-open flowers?  Now, in the darkness, they seem to be shivering; to be numbed, suffocated, so closely are they huddled together. They look as though they were prisoners; or shall we say queens who have lost their throne, who have had their one moment of glory in the midst of their radiant garden, and are now compelled to return to the dingy misery of their poor overcrowded home.  It is with them as it is with all the real things in life; they must be studied, and we have to learn how to study them.  Much is happening inside this mass that seems so inactive, but it will take you some time to grasp it and see it. The truth is that every single creature in the little groups that appear scarcely to move is hard at work, each one at its own particular trade. There is not one of them that knows what it means to be idle; and those, for instance, that seem fast asleep, as they hang in great clusters against the glass, are entrusted with the most mysterious and fatiguing task of all; it is their duty to create the marvelous wax. But we shall tell later, and in its place, precisely what each of the bees is doing; for the moment we will merely point out why it is that the different classes of workers all cluster together so strangely. The fact is that the bee, even more than the ant, is only happy when she is in the midst of a crowd; she can only live in the crowd. When she leaves the hive, which is so densely packed that she has to keep on butting with her head in order to pass, she is out of her element, away from what she loves. She will dive for an instant into flower-filled space, as the swimmer will dive into the sea that is filled with pearls; but, just as the swimmer must come to the surface and breathe the air, so must she, at regular intervals, return and breathe the crowd--or she will die. Take her away from her comrades, and however abundant the food may be, however gentle the climate, she will perish in a few days, not of hunger or cold, but merely of loneliness. She needs the crowd, she needs her own city, just as she needs the honey on which she lives. This craving for companionship in some way helps us to understand the nature of the laws that govern the hive. For in these laws the individual bee, the one bee apart from the other, simply does not count. Her entire life is sacrifice, and only sacrifice, to the bees as a race; as it were, to the everlasting community, of which she forms part.  This, however, has not always been the"]]]
