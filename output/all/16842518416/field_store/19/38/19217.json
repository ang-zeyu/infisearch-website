D.         *       *       *       *       *  The present insect is selected to illustrate a very elegant family of Butterflies, whose predominant tints are composed of orange, yellow, and white, variously blended and disposed in a greater or less degree throughout all the species. The generic characters above given will distinguish them as peculiar to the tropics, and principally those of South America; one or two species only being found in Africa, and five or six inhabiting India.  I have no doubt this is the _Pap. Statira_ of Cramer; it is found only in Brazil, and has been erroneously considered by Godart and Latreille as a variety of _C. Jugurthina_, an Indian insect, and which in fact is not in itself a species, being no other than the female of _C. Alcmeone_, as an attentive examination of a vast number of both, collected in Java by Dr. Horsfield, enabled me to ascertain.  The extraordinary prolongation of the last joint of the palpi, and the white borderless spots beneath, which are never silvered, will distinguish this species through all the variations; in the ground colour of its wings, which in no two specimens are exactly alike, and one before me is nearly white; the lesser snowy dot is sometimes very obscure, and often wanting; but the prolongation of the palpi is even expressed in Cramer's figure above quoted.  I have examined about a dozen specimens, mostly captured by myself, and all have been females; and I strongly suspect future and more decided observations will prove _C. Evadne_ to be the other sex: it has the palpi lengthened, though in a less degree; and the articulations of the antennæ in both insects will be found somewhat thickened at their termination when viewed under a magnifier, a peculiarity I have seen in no other species; and although I have examined near thirty specimens of _C. Evadne_, they have invariably proved to be males.  The palpi in this insect will be found at variance with the generic character now given; a striking proof that in a natural system no single part can be taken as an unerring criterion for generic distinction, without making it eventually an artificial one. The _Colias Drya_ of Fabricius has the same formation of palpi, but is a totally different insect.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 6  [Illustration]  COLIAS Leachiana.  _Leachian Colias._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _C. alis subrotundatis, integris, virescenti-albidis, anticis supra     fulvis, margine punctoque medio nigris, singulis subtus maculâ centrali     ferrugineâ._ Encycl.

Method._ vol. ix. p. 91.         *       *       *       *       *  In size this insect is the largest of the genus yet discovered; it was first noticed by Godart, who has given it the name of my learned and valued friend, Dr. W. E. Leach, of the British Museum, whose talents are too well known to need any eulogium in this place.  It appears to inhabit both the northern and southern extremities of Brazil; for I have seen it in a box sent from Parà, and my specimens were captured in Minas Geraes by my friend Dr. Langsdorff. It is, however, a rare species; for I have only seen seven or eight specimens, and they were all males: the female, when found, will probably differ as remarkably as in most of this genus.  The opaque spot on the inferior wings above is very large; but the tuft of hair corresponding beneath the superior wings, is entirely wanting. It should be likewise observed, that although this insect in every outward respect resembles a genuine _Colias_ (the type of which may be _C. Ebule_), it differs very materially in the terminal appendages of the abdomen; the last joint being the shortest, and scarcely pointed; and the hook, instead of being concealed beneath this segment, is exserted beyond it, and met by two others, one at the base of each lateral valve: these valves are also much shorter, ovate, and not attenuated, although ending in an incurved hook. In the present ignorance in which a true knowledge of the Lepidoptera is involved, it is impossible to say how far these dissimilarities may point out natural groups; it is therefore of the highest importance to the science such facts should be noticed.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 7  [Illustration]  CARDUELIS cucullata.  _Hooded Seed-eater._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum breve, validum, conicum, rectissimum; mandibulis subæqualibus;     apice immarginato, recto, acuto; mandibulâ superiore culmine convexâ;     inferiore basi marginis angulatâ, utrinque subtusque convexâ._  Typus Genericus _Fringilla Canaria_.

The only one I have yet seen is in the possession of E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield near Liverpool, who received it with a few other rare birds from the Spanish Main.  Total length four inches. Bill blackish and very sharp. The whole head and forepart of the neck is black. The plumage of the body is a fine reddish-orange, duller on the back and brightest beneath: wing-covers the same; the greater ones at their base black, which forms a bar: the quills are also black, the greater ones having at their base an oblique bar of orange, and some of the lesser ones slightly margined externally with white. Tail divaricated and black; some of the lateral feathers faintly margined with orange. Spurious wings black. Legs and claws brown.  The _Bouvreuil de Bourbon_, and the _B. du Cap de Bonne Esperance_ of Buffon (_Pl. Enl. pl._ 204. _fig._ 1, 2.) appear to have been described as the different sexes of one bird (the Orange Grossbeak of Latham) on mere conjecture. I think them quite distinct, inhabiting different countries, and having all the appearance (in the figures) of being two male birds; for the females in this family seldom possess the rich colours of the male; and the figure of the last of these birds, has not the slightest habit of a female.  The present genus was formed by Cuvier, (though but very slightly defined,) and includes the common Goldfinch and Canary-bird.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 8  [Illustration]  MEROPS urica.  _Javanese Bee-eater._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum productum, læve, subcurvatum, compressum; apice acuto, basi     trigono; culmine carinato.

They are all gregarious, feeding on the wing, and in general migratory.  Most unwillingly I have again in this instance anticipated my friend Dr. Horsfield in describing this bird, which he found in Java, and which I engraved after one sent from Ceylon, without knowing it had also fallen under his observation.  The figure is less than the natural size, which is nearly that of our European species. Bill an inch and a half long from the gape, and black.

Wings and quills fulvous green, the latter tipt with black, and all the inner shafts more or less rufous: the second quill longest, and the lesser quills and tail-feathers notched at their tips. Tail green, slightly forked; the tips and under side dusky-black, and three inches and a half long. Wings, when closed, four inches one line in length. Vent blueish-white.  The females in this genus may generally be distinguished by the two middle tail-feathers being but slightly or not at all elongated.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 9  [Illustration]  HELIX auriculata.  _Eared Helix._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa orbicularis vel globosa.

The mouth bears a most striking resemblance to the human ear; and the only specimen known in this country is the one here figured, from the cabinet of Ch. Dubois, Esq., who obligingly favoured me with it for examination; neither does the exquisite work on the Land Shells, by M. de Ferrusac, now publishing at Paris, contain this species among the numerous matchless figures already given of this family.  In the present uncertainty respecting the natural groups of the genus _Helix_, as left by Lamarck, I have preferred for the present following the example of Cuvier and de Ferrusac, in placing it with that family, in preference to adopting the ill-defined and palpably artificial distribution of them by D. de Montfort, or of forming a new genus for its reception.  The variegations in its colouring are better seen in the figures than described. The whole shell is slightly marked with obsolete longitudinal striæ; the umbilicus is very deep, and the tooth does not extend externally beyond the margin of the lip.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 10  [Illustration]  STROMBUS.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa ventricosa; basis canali brevi, truncato vel emarginato; labium     exterius simpliciter alatum, ala ad basin inferne emarginata; suprà     dilatata._      _Animal marinum, carnivorum, trachelipodum; corpore spirali; pede     compresso ad cervicis basin inferiorem._ Leach in Zool.

Strombus marginatus. _Dillwyn's Cat._ p. 665. no. 18.         *       *       *       *       *  A pretty and diminutive species, scarcely ever more than one inch three lines long. The spire long in proportion, and occupying half an inch: when in perfection the colour is a deep chesnut, minutely broken into finely serrated darker lines, with one, two, or three interrupted bands of white on the body whorl, the spire, and margin of the outer lip paler; there are two or three nodules above; and the spiral volutions have the carinated row of tubercles usual in the _Strombi_, and are besides finely striated transversely. The base of the shell is more deeply and distinctly striated; both the lips are much thickened, tumid, white, and highly polished; terminating above in obtuse points on the second spiral whorl, leaving a narrow ascending channel between; the inside of the aperture is a fine yellow.  Inhabits the Indian seas, but is not common.  By some unaccountable oversight, Mr. Dillwyn has very well described this shell, but under the name and supposition of its being the _S. marginatus_ of Linnæus; though a few pages after he brings all the true synonyms referring to his shell, under a description purporting to be that of _S. minimus_, but which in reality is more applicable to our next species. Why this writer should doubt the correctness of Gmelin, Chemnitz, &c. respecting the true _S. marginatus_ of Linnæus, does not appear, particularly as he has substituted for it a well known species. I have little doubt myself they all mean one and the same shell, which is nothing more than a scarce variety of _S. accinctus_, now before me, with which Linnæus's original description pretty well agrees.         *       *       *       *       *  STROMBUS variabilis.  _Variable Strombus--upper figure._      _S. testâ nodosè plicatâ, spirâ striis nullis; labio interiore     simplice, exteriore reflecto, intrà lævi, suprà leviter lobato._      Shell with nodulous plaits, the spire not striated. Inner lip simple.     Outer lip reflected, smooth within, and slightly lobed above.         *       *       *       *       *  Shell two inches and a quarter long, the spire occupying little more than half an inch. The ground colour generally is white with numerous undulated short lines of a darker colour, sometimes crossed by four or five obsolete whitish bands: it approaches very near _S. minimus_, but is easily distinguished by being in general much larger, by having the inner lip not at all thickened above, the outer lip very slightly lobed, and only advancing on the first volution of the spire: it varies, however, amazingly in colour. There is a small variety, having a brown spot beneath, from India; and others (labelled from the So. Seas) in the Banksian collection, also small, are purplish-brown, with three or four well-defined bands of white: the aperture is always pure white.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 11  [Illustration]  DRUSILLA Horsfieldii.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ mediocres, clavâ productâ, gracili, cylindraceâ.

The general resemblance of this species with _Papilio Jairus_ of Fabricius is so great, that it might pass on a cursory view as a mere variety, did not the form of the anterior wings at once point out the difference. In the present insect the posterior and exterior margins are of equal length, giving a narrow appearance to the wings, much resembling some of the true _Papilionidæ_; but in _P.
