Accordingly both the one and the other of us, with a scornful smile upon our lips, bent our heads in grim earnest to the work, which both were now desirous of accomplishing; so that after about ten days, each had finished his undertaking with great delicacy and artistic skill.  Lucagnolo’s was a huge silver piece, used at the table of Pope Clement, into which he flung away bits of bone and the rind of divers fruits, while eating; an object of ostentation rather than necessity. The vase was adorned with two fine handles, together with many masks, both small and great, and masses of lovely foliage, in as exquisite a style of elegance as could be imagined; on seeing which I said it was the most beautiful vase that ever I set eyes on. Thinking he had convinced me, Lucagnolo replied: “Your work seems to me no less beautiful, but we shall soon perceive the difference between the two.” So he took his vase and carried it to the Pope, who was very well pleased with it, and ordered at once that he should be paid at the ordinary rate of such large plate. Meanwhile I carried mine to Madonna Porzia, who looked at it with astonishment, and told me I had far surpassed my promise. Then she bade me ask for my reward whatever I liked; for it seemed to her my desert was so great that if I craved a castle she could hardly recompense me; but since that was not in her hands to bestow, she added laughing that I must beg what lay within her power. I answered that the greatest reward I could desire for my labour was to have satisfied her ladyship. Then, smiling in my turn, and bowing to her, I took my leave, saying I wanted no reward but that. She turned to the Roman lady and said: “You see that the qualities we discerned in him are companied by virtues, and not vices.” They both expressed their admiration, and then Madonna Porzia continued: “Friend Benvenuto, have you never heard it said that when the poor give to the rich, the devil laughs?” I replied: “Quite true! and yet, in the midst of all his troubles, I should like this time to see him laugh;” and as I took my leave, she said that this time she had no will to bestow on him that favour.  When I came back to the shop, Lucagnolo had the money for his vase in a paper packet; and on my arrival he cried out: “Come and compare the price of your jewel with the price of my plate.” I said that he must leave things as they were till the next day, because I hoped that even as my work in its kind was not less excellent than his, so I should be able to show him quite an equal price for it.  XXI  ON the day following, Madonna Porzia sent a major-domo of hers to my shop, who called me out, and putting into my hands a paper packet full of money from his lady, told me that she did not choose the devil should have his whole laugh out: by which she hinted that the money sent me was not the entire payment merited by my industry, and other messages were added worthy of so courteous a lady. Lucagnolo, who was burning to compare his packet with mine, burst into the shop; then in the presence of twelve journeymen and some neighbours, eager to behold the result of this competition, he seized his packet, scornfully exclaiming “Ou! ou!” three or four times, while he poured his money on the counter with a great noise. They were twenty-five crowns in giulios; and he fancied that mine would be four or five crowns 'di moneta.' [1] I for my part, stunned and stifled by his cries, and by the looks and smiles of the bystanders, first peeped into my packet; then, after seeing that it contained nothing but gold, I retired to one end of the counter, and, keeping my eyes lowered and making no noise at all, I lifted it with both hands suddenly above my head, and emptied it like a mill hopper. [2] My coin was twice as much as his; which caused the onlookers, who had fixed their eyes on me with some derision, to turn round suddenly to him and say: “Lucagnolo, Benvenuto’s pieces, being all of gold and twice as many as yours, make a far finer effect.” I thought for certain that, what with jealousy and what with shame, Lucagnolo would have fallen dead upon the spot; and though he took the third part of my gain, since I was a journeyman (for such is the custom of the trade, two-thirds fall to the workman and one-third to the masters of the shop), yet inconsiderate envy had more power in him than avarice: it ought indeed to have worked quite the other way, he being a peasant’s son from Iesi. He cursed his art and those who taught it him, vowing that thenceforth he would never work at large plate, but give his whole attention to those brothel gewgaws, since they were so well paid. Equally enraged on my side, I answered, that every bird sang its own note; that he talked after the fashion of the hovels he came from; but that I dared swear that I should succeed with ease in making his lubberly lumber, while he would never be successful in my brothel gewgaws. [3] Thus I flung off in a passion, telling him that I would soon show him that I spoke truth. The bystanders openly declared against him, holding him for a lout, as indeed he was, and me for a man, as I had proved myself.  Note 1. 'Scudi di giuli' and 'scudi di moneta.' The 'giulio' was a silver coin worth 56 Italian centimes. The 'scudi di moneta' was worth 10 'giulios.' Cellini was paid in golden crowns, which had a much higher value. The 'scuda' and the 'ducato' at this epoch were reckoned at [7] 'lire,' the 'lira' at 20 'soldi.'  Note 2. The packet was funnel-shaped, and Cellini poured the coins out from the broad end.  Note 3. The two slang phrases translated above are 'bordellerie' and 'coglionerie.'  XXII  NEXT day, I went to thank Madonna Porzia, and told her that her ladyship had done the opposite of what she said she would; for that while I wanted to make the devil laugh, she had made him once more deny God. We both laughed pleasantly at this, and she gave me other commissions for fine and substantial work.  Meanwhile, I contrived, by means of a pupil of Raffaello da Urbino, to get an order from the Bishop of Salamanca for one of those great water-vessels called 'acquereccia,' which are used for ornaments to place on sideboards. He wanted a pair made of equal size; and one of them he entrusted to Lucagnolo, the other to me. Giovan Francesco, the painter I have mentioned, gave us the design. [1] Accordingly I set hand with marvellous good-will to this piece of plate, and was accommodated with a part of his workshop by a Milanese named Maestro Giovan Piero della Tacca. Having made my preparations, I calculated how much money I should need for certain affairs of my own, and sent all the rest to assist my poor father.  It so happened that just when this was being paid to him in Florence, he stumbled upon one of those Radicals who were in the Eight at the time when I got into that little trouble there. It was the very man who had abused him so rudely, and who swore that I should certainly be sent into the country with the lances. Now this fellow had some sons of very bad morals and repute; wherefore my father said to him: “Misfortunes can happen to anybody, especially to men of choleric humour when they are in the right, even as it happened to my son; but let the rest of his life bear witness how virtuously I have brought him up. Would God, for your well-being, that your sons may act neither worse nor better toward you than mine do to me. God rendered me able to bring them up as I have done; and where my own power could not reach, ‘twas He who rescued them, against your expectation, out of your violent hands.” On leaving the man, he wrote me all this story, begging me for God’s sake to practise music at times, in order that I might not lose the fine accomplishment which he had taught me with such trouble. The letter so overflowed with expressions of the tenderest fatherly affection, that I was moved to tears of filial piety, resolving, before he died, to gratify him amply with regard to music. Thus God grants us those lawful blessings which we ask in prayer, nothing doubting.  Note 1. That is, Il Fattore. See above, p. 34.  XXIII  WHILE I was pushing forward Salamanca’s vase, I had only one little boy as help, whom I had taken at the entreaty of friends, and half against my own will, to be my workman. He was about fourteen years of age, bore the name of Paulino, and was son to a Roman burgess, who lived upon the income of his property. Paulino was the best-mannered, the most honest, and the most beautiful boy I ever saw in my whole life. His modest ways and actions, together with his superlative beauty and his devotion to myself, bred in me as great an affection for him as a man’s breast can hold. This passionate love led me oftentimes to delight the lad with music; for I observed that his marvellous features, which by complexion wore a tone of modest melancholy, brightened up, and when I took my cornet, broke into a smile so lovely and so sweet, that I do not marvel at the silly stories which the Greeks have written about the deities of heaven. Indeed, if my boy had lived in those times, he would probably have turned their heads still more. [1] He had a sister, named Faustina, more beautiful, I verily believe, than that Faustina about whom the old books gossip so. Sometimes he took me to their vineyard, and, so far as I could judge, it struck me that Paulino’s good father would have welcomed me as a son-in-law. This affair led me to play more than I was used to do.  It happened at that time that one Giangiacomo of Cesena, a musician in the Pope’s band, and a very excellent performer, sent word through Lorenzo, the trumpeter of Lucca, who is now in our Duke’s service, to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40345"],["title","A Song of the Guns (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Cover]                                A SONG OF THE GUNS                                      BY                          GILBERT FRANKAU, R.S.A.

The author, who is now serving in Flanders, was present at the battle of Loos, and during a lull in the fighting--when the gunners, who had been sleepless for five nights, were resting like tired dogs under their guns--he jotted down the main theme of the poem.  After the battle the artillery brigade to which he was attached was ordered to Ypres, and it was during the long trench warfare in this district, within sight of the ruined tower of Ypres Cathedral, that the poem was finally completed. The last three stanzas were written at midnight in Brigade Headquarters with the German shells screaming over into the ruined town.                                     CONTENTS   The Voice of the Slaves Headquarters Gun-Teams Eyes in the Air Signals The Observers Ammunition Column The Voice of the Guns                                A SONG OF THE GUNS       These are our masters, the slim       Grim muzzles that irk in the pit;     That chafe for the rushing of wheels,       For the teams plunging madly to bit     As the gunners wing down to unkey,       For the trails sweeping half-circle-right,     For the six breech-blocks clashing as one       To a target viewed clear on the sight--     Gray masses the shells search and tear       Into fragments that bunch as they run--     For the hour of the red battle-harvest,       The dream of the slaves of the gun!      We have bartered our souls to the guns;       Every fibre of body and brain     Have we trained to them, chained to them.  Serfs?       Aye! but proud of the weight of our chain,     Of our backs that are bowed to their workings,       To hide them and guard and disguise,     Of our ears that are deafened with service,       Of hands that are scarred, and of eyes     Grown hawklike with marking their prey,       Of wings that are slashed as with swords     When we hover, the turn of a blade       From the death that is sweet to our lords.                             THE VOICE OF THE SLAVES       _By the ears and the eyes and the brain,_       _By the limbs and the hands and the wings,_     _We are slaves to our masters the guns;_       _But their slaves are the masters of kings!_                                   HEADQUARTERS       A league and a league from the trenches,       from the traversed maze of the lines,--     Where daylong the sniper watches and daylong the       bullet whines,     And the cratered earth is in travail with mines and       with countermines,--      Here, where haply some woman dreamed, (are       those her roses that bloom     In the garden beyond the windows of my littered       working-room?)     We have decked the map for our masters as a bride       is decked for the groom.      Here, on each numbered lettered square,--cross-road       and mound and wire,     Loophole, redoubt, and emplacement, are the targets       their mouths desire,--     Gay with purples and browns and blues, have we       traced them their arcs of fire.      And ever the type-keys clatter; and ever our keen       wires bring     Word from the watchers a-crouch below, word       from the watchers a-wing;     And ever we hear the distant growl of our hid guns       thundering;      Hear it hardly, and turn again to our maps, where       the trench-lines crawl,     Red on the gray and each with a sign for the       ranging shrapnel’s fall--     Snakes that our masters shall scotch at dawn, as is       written here on the wall.      For the weeks of our waiting draw to a close....       There is scarcely a leaf astir     In the garden beyond my windows where the       twilight shadows blur     The blaze of some woman’s roses....         \"Bombardment orders, sir.\"                                    GUN-TEAMS       Their rugs are sodden, their heads are down, their         tails are turned to the storm.       (Would you know them, you that groomed them         in the sleek fat days of peace,--     When the tiles rang to their pawings in the lighted         stalls and warm,--       Now the foul clay cakes on breeching-strap and         clogs the quick-release?)      The blown rain stings, there is never a star, the         tracks are rivers of slime.       (You must harness up by guesswork with a         failing torch for light,     Instep-deep in unmade standings, for it’s active-service time,       And our resting weeks are over, and we move         the guns to-night.)      The iron tires slither, the traces sag; their blind         hooves stumble and slide;       They are war-worn, they are weary, soaked with         sweat and sopped with rain.     (You must hold them, you must help them, swing         your lead and centre wide       Where the greasy granite pave peters out to         squelching drain.)      There is shrapnel bursting a mile in front on the         road that the guns must take:       (You are nervous, you are thoughtful, you are         shifting in your seat,     As you watch the ragged feathers flicker orange         flame and break)--       But the teams are pulling steady down the         battered village street.      You have shod them cold, and their coats are long,         and their bellies gray with the mud;       They have done with gloss and polish, but the         fighting heart’s unbroke.     We, who saw them hobbling after us down white         roads flecked with blood,       Patient, wondering why we left them, till we         lost them in the smoke;      Who have felt them shiver between our knees,         when the shells rain black from the skies,       When the bursting terrors find us and the lines         stampede as one;     Who have watched the pierced limbs quiver and         the pain in stricken eyes,       Know the worth of humble servants, foolish-faithful         to their gun!                                 EYES IN THE AIR       Our guns are a league behind us, our target a mile below,     And there’s never a cloud to blind us from the haunts of       our lurking foe--     Sunk pit whence his shrapnel tore us, support-trench             crest-concealed,     As clear as the charts before us, his ramparts lie revealed.     His panicked watchers spy us, a droning threat in the void;     Their whistling shells outfly us--puff upon puff, deployed     Across the green beneath us, across the flanking grey,     In fume and fire to sheathe us and balk us of our prey.      Below, beyond, above her,       Their iron web is spun!     Flicked but unsnared we hover,       Edged planes against the sun:     Eyes in the air above his lair,       The hawks that guide the gun!      No word from earth may reach us save, white against the ground,     The strips outspread to teach us whose ears are deaf to sound:     But down the winds that sear us, athwart our engine’s shriek,     We send--and know they hear us, the ranging guns we speak.     Our visored eyeballs show us their answering pennant, broke     Eight thousand feet below us, a whirl of flame-stabbed smoke--     The burst that hangs to guide us, while numbed gloved fingers             tap     From wireless key beside us the circles of the map.      Line--target--short or over--       Comes, plain as clock-hands run,     Word from the birds that hover,       Unblinded, tail to sun--     Word out of air to range them fair,       From hawks that guide the gun!      Your flying shells have failed you, your landward guns are dumb:     Since earth hath naught availed you, these skies be open!  Come,     Where, wild to meet and mate you, flame in their beaks for             breath,     Black doves! the white hawks wait you on the wind-tossed       boughs of death.     These boughs be cold without you, our hearts are hot for this,     Our wings shall beat about you, our scorching breath shall kiss:     Till, fraught with that we gave you, fulfilled of our desire,     You bank,--too late to save you from biting beaks of fire,--      Turn sideways from your lover,       Shudder and swerve and run,     Tilt; stagger; and plunge over       Ablaze against the sun,--     Doves dead in air, who clomb to dare       The hawks that guide the gun!                                     SIGNALS         The hot wax drips from the flares       On the scrawled pink forms that litter       The bench where he sits; the glitter     Of stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dug-out stairs.       And the lagging watch-hands creep;       And his cloaked mates murmur in sleep,--       Forms he can wake with a kick,--     And he hears, as he plays with the pressel-switch, the strapped         receiver click       On his ear that listens, listens;       And the candle-flicker glistens     On the rounded brass of the switch-board where the red wires         cluster thick.        Wires from the earth, from the air;       Wires that whisper and chatter       At night, when the trench-rats patter     And nibble among the rations and scuttle back to their lair;       Wires that are never at rest,--       For the linesmen tap them and test,       And ever they tremble with tone:--     And he knows from a hundred signals the buzzing call of his own,       The breaks and the vibrant stresses,--       The Z and the G and the S’s     That call his hand to the answering key and his mouth to the         microphone.
