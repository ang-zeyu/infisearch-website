It won’t be of use to you, especially the diamond earrings,” he added, with a coarse laugh.  “No,” answered Rodney shortly.  “My eyes, wouldn’t my mother like to own all this jewelry. She’s fond of ornament, but pa won’t buy them for her.”  Rodney did not answer.  “I say, Ropes, I mustn’t forget my errand. Will you do me a favor?”  “What is it?”  “Lend me five dollars till the first of next month. My allowance comes due then. Now I haven’t but a quarter left.”  “What makes you apply to me, Bundy?”  “Because you always have money. I don’t suppose you are worth as much as my father, but you have more money for yourself than I have.”  “I have had, perhaps, but I haven’t now.”  “Why, what’s up? What has happened?”  “I have lost my fortune.”  John whistled. This was his way of expressing amazement.  “Why, what have you been doing? How could you lose your fortune?”  “My guardian has lost it for me. That amount to the same thing.”  “When did you hear that?”  “This morning.”  “Is that true? Are you really a poor boy?”  “Yes.”  John Bundy was astonished, but on the whole he was not saddened. In the estimation of the school Rodney had always ranked higher than he, and been looked upon as the star pupil in point of wealth.  Now that he was dethroned John himself would take his place. This would be gratifying, though just at present, and till the beginning of the next month, he would be distressed for ready money.  “Well, that’s a stunner!” he said. “How do you feel about it? Shall you stay in school?”  “No; I can’t afford it. I must get to work.”  “Isn’t there anything left--not a cent?”  “There may be a few dollars.”  “And then,” said Bundy with a sudden thought, “there is this casket of jewelry. You can sell it for a good deal of money.”  “I don’t mean to sell it.”  “Then you’re a fool; that’s all I’ve got to say.”  “I don’t suppose you will understand my feeling in the matter, but these articles belonged to my mother. They are all I have to remind me of her. I do not mean to sell them unless it is absolutely necessary.”  “I would sell them quicker’n a wink,” said Bundy. “What’s the good of keeping them?”  “We won’t discuss the matter,” said Rodney coldly.  “Do you mind my telling the other boys about your losing your money?”  “No; it will be known tomorrow at any rate; there is no advantage in concealing it.”  A heavy step was heard outside. It stopped before the door.  “I must be getting,” said Bundy, “or I’ll get into trouble.”  It was against the rule at the school for boys to make calls upon each other in the evening unless permission were given.  John Bundy opened the door suddenly, and to his dismay found himself facing the rigid figure of Dr. Sampson, the principal.  “How do you happen to be here, Bundy?” asked the doctor sternly.  “Please, sir, I was sympathizing with Ropes on his losing his money,”  said Bundy with ready wit.  “Very well! I will excuse you this time.”  “I’m awful sorry for you, Ropes,” said Bundy effusively.  “Thank you,” responded Rodney.  “You can go now,” said the principal. “I have a little business with Master Ropes.”  “All right, sir. Good night.”  “Good night.”  “Won’t you sit down, Dr. Sampson?” said Rodney politely, and he took the casket from the chair.  “Yes, I wish to have five minutes’ conversation with you. So these are the jewels, are they?”  “Yes, sir.”  “They seem to be quite valuable,” went on the doctor, lifting the pearl necklace and poising it in his fingers. “It will be well for you to have them appraised by a jeweler.”  “It would, sir, if I wished to sell them, but I mean to keep them as they are.”  “I would hardly advise it. You will need the money. Probably you do not know how near penniless you are.”  “No, sir; I don’t know.”  “Your guardian, as you are aware, sent me a check for one hundred and twenty five dollars. I have figured up how much of this sum is due to me, and I find it to be one hundred and thirteen dollars and thirty seven cents.”  “Yes, sir,” said Rodney indifferently.  “This leaves for you only eleven dollars and sixty three cents. You follow me, do you not?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Have you any money saved up from your allowance?”  “A few dollars only, sir.”  “Ahem! that is a pity. You will need all you can raise. But of course you did not anticipate what has occurred?”  “No, sir.”  “I will throw off the thirty seven cents,” said the principal magnanimously, “and give you back twelve dollars.”  “I would rather pay you the whole amount of your bill,” said Rodney.  “Ahem! Well perhaps that would be more business-like. So you don’t wish to part with any of the jewelry, Ropes?”  “No, sir.”  “I thought, perhaps, by way of helping you, I would take the earrings, and perhaps the necklace, off your hands and present them to Mrs. Sampson.”  Rodney shuddered with aversion at the idea of these precious articles, which had once belonged to his mother, being transferred to the stout and coarse featured consort of the principal.  “I think I would rather keep them,” he replied.  “Oh well, just as you please,” said Dr. Sampson with a shade of disappointment for he had no idea of paying more than half what the articles were worth. “If the time comes when you wish to dispose of them let me know.”  Rodney nodded, but did not answer in words.  “Of course, Ropes,” went on the doctor in a perfunctory way, “I am very sorry for you. I shall miss you, and, if I could afford it, I would tell you to stay without charge. But I am a poor man.”  “Yes,” said Rodney hastily, “I understand. I thank you for your words but would not under any circumstances accept such a favor at your hands.”  “I am afraid you are proud, Ropes. Pride is--ahem--a wrong feeling.”  “Perhaps so, Dr. Sampson, but I wish to earn my own living without being indebted to any one.”  “Perhaps you are right, Ropes. I dare say I should feel so myself. When do you propose leaving us?”  “Some time tomorrow, sir.”  “I shall feel sad to have you go. You have been here so long that you seem to me like a son. But we must submit to the dispensations of Providence--” and Dr. Sampson blew a vigorous blast upon his red silk handkerchief. “I will give you the balance due in the morning.”  “Very well, sir.”  Rodney was glad to be left alone. He had no faith in Dr. Sampson’s sympathy. The doctor had the reputation of being worth from thirty to forty thousand dollars, and his assumption of being a poor man Rodney knew to be a sham.  He went to bed early, for tomorrow was to be the beginning of a new life for him.    CHAPTER III.   A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.   When it was generally known in the school that Rodney was to leave because he had lost his property much sympathy was felt and expressed for him.  Though he had received more than ordinary attention from the principal on account of his pecuniary position and expectations, this had not impaired his popularity. He never put on any airs and was on as cordial relations with the poorest student as with the richest.  “I’m awfully sorry you’re going, Rodney,” said more than one. “Is it really true that you have lost your property?”  “Yes, it is true.”  “Do you feel bad about it?”  “I feel sorry, but not discouraged.”  “I say, Rodney,” said Ernest Rayner, in a low voice, calling Rodney aside, “are you very short of money?”  “I haven’t much left, Ernest.”  “Because I received five dollars last week as a birthday present. I haven’t spent any of it. You can have it as well as not.”  Rodney was much moved. “My dear Ernest,” he said, putting his arm caressingly around the neck of the smaller boy, “you are a true friend. I won’t forget your generous offer, though I don’t need to accept it.”  “But are you sure you have money enough?” asked Ernest.  “Yes, I have enough for the present. By the time I need more I shall have earned it.”  There was one boy, already introduced, John Bundy, who did not share in the general feeling of sympathy for Rodney. This was John Bundy.  He felt that Rodney’s departure would leave him the star pupil and give him the chief social position in school. As to scholarship he was not ambitious to stand high in that.  “I say, Ropes,” he said complacently, “I’m to have your room after you’re gone.”  “I congratulate you,” returned Rodney. “It is an excellent room.”  “Yes, I s’pose it’ll make you feel bad. Where are you going?”  “I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have done.”  “Oh yes, I guess there’s no doubt of that. I’m going to get pa to send me some nice pictures to hang on the wall. When you come back here on a visit you’ll see how nice it looks.”  “I think it will be a good while before I come here on a visit.”  “Yes. I s’pose it’ll make you feel bad. Where are you going?”  “To the City of New York.”  “You’ll have to live in a small hall bedroom there.”  “Why will I?”  “Because you are poor, and it costs a good deal of money to live in New York. It’ll be a great come down.”  “It will indeed, but if I can earn enough to support me in plain style I won’t complain. I suppose you’ll call and see me when you come to New York?”  “Perhaps so, if you don’t live in a tenement house. Pa objects to my going to tenement houses. There’s no knowing what disease there may be in them.”  “It is well to be prudent,” said Rodney, smiling.  It did not trouble him much to think he was not likely to receive a call from his quondan schoolmate.  “Here is the balance of your money, Ropes,” said Dr. Sampson, drawing a small roll of bills from his pocket, later in the day. “I am quite willing to give you the odd thirty seven cents.”  “Thank you, doctor, but I shan’t need it.”  “You are poorly provided. Now I would pay you a good sum for some of your mother’s jewelry, as I told you last evening.”  “Thank you,” said Rodney hastily, “but I don’t care to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/399"],["title","Cast Upon the Breakers (#2)"],["body","at present.”  “Let me know when you are ready to dispose of the necklace.”  Here the depot carriage appeared in the street outside and Rodney with his gripsack in one hand and the precious casket in the other, climbed to a seat beside the driver.  His trunk he left behind, promising to send for it when he had found a new boarding place.  There was a chorus of good byes. Rodney waved his handkerchief in general farewell, and the carriage started for the depot.  “Be you goin’ for good?” asked Joel, the driver, who knew Rodney well and felt friendly to him.  “Yes, Joel.”  “It’s kind of sudden, isn’t it?”  “Yes.”  “What makes you go?”  “Bad news, Joel.”  “Be any of your folks dead?”  “It is not death. I haven’t any ‘folks.’ I’m alone in the world. It’s because I’ve lost my property and am too poor to remain in school.”  “That’s too bad,” said the driver in a tone of sympathy. “Where are you goin’?”  “To the city.”  “Are you goin’ to work?”  “Yes, I shall have to.”  “If you was a little older you might get a chance to drive a street car, but I s’pose you’re too young.”  “Yes, I don’t think they would take me.”  “I’ve thought sometimes I should like such a chance myself,” said Joel. “I’ve got tired of the country. I should like to live in the city where there’s theaters, and shows, and such like. Do you know what the drivers on street cars get?”  “No, I never heard.”  “I wish you’d find out and let me know. You can send the letter to Joel Phipps, Groveton. Then find out if it’s easy to get such a chance.”  “I will. I shall be glad to oblige you.”  “You always was obligin’, Rodney. I’ve asked Jack Bundy to do it--you know his folks live in the city--but he never would. He’s a mighty disagreeable boy. He never liked you.”  “Didn’t he?”  “No, I surmise he was jealous of you. He used to say you put on so many airs it made him sick.”  “I don’t think any of the other boys would say that.”  “No, but they could say it of him. Do you think his father is rich?”  “I have always heard that he was.”  “I hope he’s better about paying his debt than Jack. I lent him twenty five cents a year ago and I never could get it back.”  The distance from the school to the station was a mile. Joel fetched the carriage round with a sweep and then jumped off, opened the door, and then helped the passengers to disembark, if that word is allowable.  “How soon does the train start, Joel?” asked Rodney.  “In about five minutes.”  “Then I had better purchase my ticket without delay.”  “Don’t forget to ask about horse car drivers!”  “No, I won’t. I should like to have you come to New York. I know no one there, and I should feel glad to see a familiar face.”  The train came up in time, and Rodney was one of half a dozen passengers who entered the cars.  He obtained a place next to a stout man dressed in a pepper and salt suit.  “Is this seat engaged?” asked Rodney.  “Yes--to you,” and his fellow passenger laughed.  Rodney laughed too, for he saw that the remark was meant to be jocose.  He put his gripsack on the floor at his feet, but held the casket in his lap. He did not like to run any risk with that.  “Are you a drummer?” asked the stout man, with a glance at the casket.  “No, sir.”  “I thought you might be, and that THAT might contain your samples.”  “No, sir. That is private property.”  He had thought of telling what it contained, but checked himself. He knew nothing of his companion, and was not sure how far it might be safe to trust a stranger.  “I used to be a drummer myself--in the jewelry line--” continued his companion, “and I carried a box just like that.”  “Ah, indeed! Then you are not in that business now?”  “No, I got tired of it. I deal in quite a different article now.”  “Indeed?”  “Suburban lot.”  “You don’t happen to have any of them with you?”  The stout man roared with laughter, giving Rodney the impression that he had said a very witty thing.  “That’s a good one,” he remarked, “the best I’ve heard for a long time. No, I haven’t any of the lots with me, but I’ve got a circular. Just cast your eye over that,” and he drew a large and showy prospectus from his pocket.  “If you should be looking for a good investment,” he continued, “you can’t do any better than buy a lot at Morton Park. It is only eighteen miles from the city and is rapidly building up. You can buy lot on easy installments, and I will myself pick one out for you that is almost sure to double in value in a year or two.”  “Thank you,” said Rodney, “but I shall have to invest my money, if I get any, in a different way.”  “As what for instance?”  “In board and lodging.”  “Good. That is even more necessary than real estate.”  “How long have you been in the business, sir?”  “About six months.”  “And how does it pay?”  “Very well, if you know how to talk.”  “I should think you might do well, then.”  “Thank you. I appreciate the compliment. What business are you going into, that is, if you are going to the city?”  “I am going to the city, but I have no idea yet what I shall do.”  “Perhaps you may like to become an agent for our lots. I shall be ready to employ you as sub agent if you feel disposed.”  “Thank you, sir. If you will give me your card, I may call upon you.”  The short man drew from his card case a business card. It bore the name   ADIN WOODS. ROYAL BUILDING. NASSAU ST. Morton Park Lots.   “Come to see me at any time,” he said, “and we will talk the matter over.”  Here the train boy came along and Rodney bought a copy of Puck, while the agent resumed the perusal of a copy of a magazine. For an hour the cars ran smoothly. Then there was a sudden shock causing all the passengers to start to their feet.  “We’re off the track!” shouted an excitable person in front of Rodney.  The instinct of self preservation is perhaps stronger than any other. Rodney and his seat mate both jumped to their feet and hurried to the door of the car, not knowing what was in store for them.  But fortunately the train had not been going rapidly. It was approaching a station and was “slowing up.” So, though it had really run off the track, there was not likely to be any injury to the passengers.  “We are safe,” said Adin Woods. “The only harm done is the delay. I hope that won’t be long. Suppose we go back to our seat.” They returned to the seat which they had jointly occupied.  Then Rodney made an alarming discovery. “My casket!” he exclaimed. “Where is it?”  “What did you do with it?”  “Left it on the seat.”  “It may have fallen to the floor.”  Rodney searched for it in feverish excitement, but his search was vain. THE CASKET HAD DISAPPEARED!    CHAPTER IV.   IN PURSUIT OF A THIEF.   “Were the contents of the casket valuable?” asked the land agent.  “Yes; it contained my mother’s jewels, all the more valuable because she is dead,” replied Rodney.  “Were they of much intrinsic worth?”  “They must be worth several hundred dollars at least.”  “Then they must be found,” said Adin Woods energetically. “They have evidently been taken by some passenger during the five minutes we were away from our seat.”  “Were you inquiring about the casket?” asked a lady sitting opposite.  “Yes, madam. Can you give any information about it?”  “Just after you left your seat the man that sat behind you rose and reaching over for it went to the rear end of the car and got out.”  “I wish you had stopped him, madam.”  “He was so cool about it that I thought he might be a friend of the young gentleman.”  “I didn’t know him. He must have been a thief.”  “What was his appearance, madam?” asked the lot agent.  “He was a thin, dark complexioned man, with side whiskers coming half way down his cheeks.”  “And you say he got out of the rear end of the car?”  “Yes, sir.”  “He won’t get on the train again,” said the agent turning to Rodney. “He thinks the casket valuable enough to pay him for the interruption of his journey.”  “What shall I do then?” asked Rodney, feeling helpless and at a loss which way to turn.  “Follow him,” said the agent briefly. “He will probably stop over in the village a day and resume his journey tomorrow.”  “Even if I found him I am afraid I shouldn’t know how to deal with him.”  “Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll stop over with you and help you make it hot for him. I’ve had a spite against thieves ever since I had a valuable overcoat stolen in one of my journeys.”  “I shall feel very much obliged to you, Mr. Woods, but won’t it interfere with your business?”  “Not materially. If we succeed in overhauling the rascal I shall feel sufficiently repaid for the small interruption. But come on, we can’t afford to linger here while he is carrying off the plunder.”  “I don’t know how I can repay you, Mr. Woods,” said Rodney gratefully.  “You can buy a lot of me when you get rich enough.”  “I will certainly do so, though I am afraid it will be a long time first.”  “You don’t know what good fortune may be in store for you. Did you notice, madam, in which direction the thief went?”  “Yes, I was looking out of the window. He went over the road to the left.”  “That leads to the village. You will see, Mr. Ropes, that I was right about his plans.”  “Don’t call me Mr. Ropes. Call me Rodney.”  “I will. It don’t seem natural to dub a boy Mr. Now, Rodney, follow me.”  The two passengers set out on the road that led to the village. They could see the latter easily, for it was not more than a mile away.  “He will be surprised to think we have ‘struck his trail’ so quick,”  said the agent.  “Where shall we go first?”  “To the hotel if there is one.”  “The village seems small.”  “Yes, there are only a few hundred inhabitant probably. It is not a place where a traveler would be likely to interrupt his journey unless he had a special object in doing so, like our dishonest friend. However, I think we shall be able to balk his little game.”  Ten minutes’ walk brought them to the village. Looking about they saw a small hotel just across the way from a neat white chapel.  “Follow me,” said the agent.  They went into "]]]
