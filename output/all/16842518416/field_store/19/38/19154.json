Cortes led them to a place, on the verge of a deep ravine, where there was an old tree with a hollow trunk that looked as if it had been struck by lightning.  \"You and your friend will remain here,\" said the man to Harry.  \"I will be as quick as I can, but in any case I cannot be back until midnight. If I do not return by then, you will know that I am dead; then—if you are wise—you will go back to Calabar.  If the Germans come, you will hide.\"  And he pointed to the hollow tree.  Without another word he set forward on his way, gliding down the face of the living rock like some gigantic lizard.  The two boys found themselves in a place romantic but terrible.  On every side they were surrounded by the impenetrable hills.  The trees of the forest stood forth in the semi-darkness like great, ghostly giants. Somewhere near at hand a mountain stream roared and thundered over the rocks.  The breeze brought to their nostrils the smell of the swamp lower down the valley.  The hollow tree stood on the edge of the bush. A few yards away was the ravine, the bottom of which was wide and bare and stony.  Throughout the earlier part of the night they possessed their souls in patience.  It was stiflingly hot after the cool mountain air.  Harry looked at his watch.  It was midnight.  There was no sign of the brothers.  Suddenly they heard a stone shifted from its place somewhere in the forest to go rolling down into the ravine.  Both stood motionless and expectant.  \"I heard something,\" said Braid.  \"So did I,\" said Harry.  Again a stone was moved, this time nearer than before.  Something was approaching through the bush.  If this were an enemy they would have small chance of escaping, for the side of the ravine was inaccessible; it was like a precipice.  They waited in suspense, and presently to the great gnarled roots of the very tree by which they were standing, there crawled a dying, wounded mountain goat.  It died almost as it reached them.  Indeed, it was almost a miracle that the animal had lived as long as it had, for Harry’s bullet had penetrated its chest.  The long night passed in waiting, and still there was no sign of the half-caste brothers.  It was then that they fully realized for the first time the extreme danger of their mission, that they were alone in the heart of a country which was almost unexplored, cut off from their friends and civilization, with no chance of succour and little of returning in safety to the coast.  \"Jim,\" said Harry, and his voice was husky, \"I wonder if we shall ever get out of this alive.\"  \"I can’t say, sir,\" answered Braid; \"but I’m sure of this: if we have to die, we’ll make a fight of it, at least.\"  It was then that a sound came to their ears that caused them to hold their breath.  It was a loud word of command in the German language, and which, moreover, came from not far away.  They lay down flat upon their faces.  Screened by a clump of long grass, they were able to look down into the ravine, where they beheld a company of German native troops with whom were two or three European officers and several German noncommissioned officers.  The men marched well in step, keeping their dressing and acting promptly and smartly at each word of command.  Except for their black skins and coarse negro features they might have learned their drill on the parade-grounds of Potsdam and Berlin.  The two boys regarded them in consternation, mingled with amazement—due to the fact that in the centre of the company was a European whose hands were bound behind his back and around whose neck was a kind of halter.  Jim Braid recognized this man at once.  It was Peter Klein, the spy.     CHAPTER X—When All was Still   Among the native troops was a man who was not dressed in uniform, who was tattooed from head to foot, and who wore upon his head an abundance of coloured feathers.  They learned afterwards that he was a medicine or \"fetish\" man—and \"fetish worship\" is the curse of the Dark Continent, from Ashanti to the Zambesi.  The medicine-men, who profess to practise witchcraft, are far more powerful than the majority of the native kings. At their bidding innocent people are often put to death, which enables them to use their powers for bribery and corruption.  In the centre of the ravine, immediately below the place where the two boys were hiding, the officer in command called a halt.  When the men had fallen out and released their packs from their shoulders, the witch-doctor addressed them in an excited, high-pitched voice.  Neither Harry nor Braid could understand a word of what he said, but his grimaces and gesticulations were so expressive that they could have no doubt that he was performing some kind of religious ceremony.  It was evident that the party intended to pitch their camp in the ravine, for several men under the command of one of the non-commissioned officers set about collecting wood with which to make a fire.  The boys knew not what course to take.  Their first inclination was to take to their heels, seeking refuge in the forest.  Then they remembered that if they did this there would be small chance of their being found by Cortes, who had promised to return to the ravine.  As silently as possible they crawled on hands and knees to the hollow tree, and hid themselves in the trunk.  There they remained for hour after hour.  From that position they were just able to see into the gorge.  The party had split up into three groups: the German officers sat alone; the European noncommissioned officers formed a ring around a smaller fire; whereas the natives were congregated around the fetish-man.  Peter Klein sat like a figure of stone, a sentry with bayonet fixed standing over him.  His lips were bloodless, his eyes staring, his face like that of a ghost.  From time to time the Germans looked at him and laughed.  For all that, they repeatedly offered him food; but he refused to eat, though now his hands had been unbound.  After a while many of the men disposed themselves for sleep, lying down upon the bare rocks about the embers of the fire.  The officer in command—a stout major with a bristling moustache—gave orders that the prisoner’s hands should again be bound.  Whereupon a sergeant propped the prisoner up, with his back to the side of the ravine, making it perfectly plain—even to the boys who could not understand the German language—that, if he endeavoured to escape, they would not hesitate to kill him.  The sentry was not posted for the night on the side of the ravine on which were the two boys, but on the other side, overlooking the valley to the east.  It was apparently from this direction that the Germans seemed to fear for their safety.  Harry thought the matter out.  If the two brothers were alive, he could not think why they had not returned.  It was now past one o’clock, and Cortes had said he would be back certainly before twelve.  The night passed in the bush in solemn tranquillity, save for the droning of myriads of insects from the mangrove swamp and the gurgling sound of the river.  Hour by hour the moon mounted in the skies above the hill-tops, which were capped by mist.  The two boys were squashed together in the tree-trunk.  Braid, it seemed, had gone to sleep in a standing position.  He was breathing heavily.  Stealthily Harry left his hiding-place and dropped down upon hands and knees.  Cautiously he crept to the edge of the ravine and looked over. To the boy’s surprise, he observed that not only the Germans and the native soldiers, but also the sentry, were sound asleep.  They lay in huddled attitudes around the dying fires.  With his back against the rock was Peter Klein.  As Harry watched him the man moved and heaved a sigh.  Presently he groaned.  Harry Urquhart was one who was quick to think.  This man, Klein, was a spy, one fit to be despised, and moreover a German, an enemy of his country.  And yet, for some reason or other, Klein was a prisoner in the hands of his own countrymen.  Von Hardenberg, perhaps, was not so far away.  These were questions that could possibly be answered by Peter Klein himself, who might be disposed to speak in gratitude for his deliverance.  There was only one way in which the prisoner could be rescued.  It was not possible for Harry to descend the sides of the ravine, neither was it possible for Klein, even had his hands and legs not been bound, to climb up the cliffs.  As stealthily as before, Urquhart crawled back into the wood, until he came to a place where there was a long, rope-like creeper—one of those vegetable parasites which are so common in the forests of the tropics. To cut this near the roots and tear it from the tree to which it clung so tenaciously was the work of not many minutes, and Harry was in possession of what to all intents and purposes was a very useful rope.  With this he repaired in haste to the edge of the ravine, where he tied the end of it to the trunk of a tree.  That done, hand over hand he let himself down to the bottom.  Stepping over the forms of the sleeping soldiers he approached the captive, and with his jack-knife cut the bonds that bound Klein’s feet and hands.  \"Now,\" he whispered in the man’s ear, \"climb, and you are safe!\"  The spy was still so terrified and so weakened from exhaustion that it was all he could do to walk.  With faltering steps he stumbled towards the dangling rope, and Harry feared that he would fall and wake the sleeping Germans.  Peter Klein took hold of the swinging creeper and did his best to climb. Presently he looked round at Harry with an expression of despair upon his face.  \"I can’t do it!\" he groaned in broken English.  \"You must,\" said the boy.  \"Your life depends upon it.  Once you get to the top you are safe.  They cannot follow you.  They have no rope, and will be obliged to go a long way round.\"  These words had the desired effect upon the spy.  Fear, on occasion, is a great stimulant; it sometimes leads"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/392"],["title","Jerusalem Delivered (#0)"],["body","Liberata  (“Jerusalem Delivered”)  by Torquato Tasso  (1544-1595)  Published 1581 in Parma, Italy.

God sends his angel to Tortosa down, Godfrey unites the Christian Peers and Knights; And all the Lords and Princes of renown Choose him their Duke, to rule the wares and fights. He mustereth all his host, whose number known, He sends them to the fort that Sion hights; The aged tyrant Juda’s land that guides, In fear and trouble, to resist provides.  I The sacred armies, and the godly knight, That the great sepulchre of Christ did free, I sing; much wrought his valor and foresight, And in that glorious war much suffered he; In vain ’gainst him did Hell oppose her might, In vain the Turks and Morians armed be: His soldiers wild, to brawls and mutinies prest, Reduced he to peace, so Heaven him blest.  II O heavenly Muse, that not with fading bays Deckest thy brow by the Heliconian spring, But sittest crowned with stars’ immortal rays In Heaven, where legions of bright angels sing; Inspire life in my wit, my thoughts upraise, My verse ennoble, and forgive the thing, If fictions light I mix with truth divine, And fill these lines with other praise than thine.  III Thither thou know’st the world is best inclined Where luring Parnass most his sweet imparts, And truth conveyed in verse of gentle kind To read perhaps will move the dullest hearts: So we, if children young diseased we find, Anoint with sweets the vessel’s foremost parts To make them taste the potions sharp we give; They drink deceived, and so deceived, they live.  IV Ye noble Princes, that protect and save The Pilgrim Muses, and their ship defend From rock of Ignorance and Error’s wave, Your gracious eyes upon this labor bend: To you these tales of love and conquest brave I dedicate, to you this work I send: My Muse hereafter shall perhaps unfold Your fights, your battles, and your combats bold.  V For if the Christian Princes ever strive To win fair Greece out of the tyrants’ hands, And those usurping Ismaelites deprive Of woful Thrace, which now captived stands, You must from realms and seas the Turks forth drive, As Godfrey chased them from Juda’s lands, And in this legend, all that glorious deed, Read, whilst you arm you; arm you, whilst you read.  VI Six years were run since first in martial guise The Christian Lords warraid the eastern land; Nice by assault, and Antioch by surprise, Both fair, both rich, both won, both conquered stand, And this defended they in noblest wise ’Gainst Persian knights and many a valiant band; Tortosa won, lest winter might them shend, They drew to holds, and coming spring attend.  VII The sullen season now was come and gone, That forced them late cease from their noble war, When God Almighty form his lofty throne, Set in those parts of Heaven that purest are (As far above the clear stars every one, As it is hence up to the highest star), Looked down, and all at once this world beheld, Each land, each city, country, town and field.  VIII All things he viewed, at last in Syria stayed Upon the Christian Lords his gracious eye, That wondrous look wherewith he oft surveyed Men’s secret thoughts that most concealed lie He cast on puissant Godfrey, that assayed To drive the Turks from Sion’s bulwarks high, And, full of zeal and faith, esteemed light All worldly honor, empire, treasure, might:  IX In Baldwin next he spied another thought, Whom spirits proud to vain ambition move: Tancred he saw his life’s joy set at naught, So woe-begone was he with pains of love: Boemond the conquered folk of Antioch brought, The gentle yoke of Christian rule to prove: He taught them laws, statutes and customs new, Arts, crafts, obedience, and religion true;  X And with such care his busy work he plied, That to naught else his acting thoughts he bent: In young Rinaldo fierce desires he spied, And noble heart of rest impatient; To wealth or sovereign power he naught applied His wits, but all to virtue excellent; Patterns and rules of skill, and courage bold, He took from Guelpho, and his fathers old.  XI Thus when the Lord discovered had, and seen The hidden secrets of each worthy’s breast, Out of the hierarchies of angels sheen The gentle Gabriel called he from the rest, ’Twixt God and souls of men that righteous been Ambassador is he, forever blest, The just commands of Heaven’s Eternal King, ’Twixt skies and earth, he up and down doth bring.  XII To whom the Lord thus spake: “Godfredo find, And in my name ask him, why doth he rest? Why be his arms to ease and peace resigned? Why frees he not Jerusalem distrest? His peers to counsel call, each baser mind Let him stir up; for, chieftain of the rest I choose him here, the earth shall him allow, His fellows late shall be his subjects now.”  XIII This said, the angel swift himself prepared To execute the charge imposed aright, In form of airy members fair imbared, His spirits pure were subject to our sight, Like to a man in show and shape he fared, But full of heavenly majesty and might, A stripling seemed he thrive five winters old, And radiant beams adorned his locks of gold.  XIV Of silver wings he took a shining pair, Fringed with gold, unwearied, nimble, swift; With these he parts the winds, the clouds, the air, And over seas and earth himself doth lift, Thus clad he cut the spheres and circles fair, And the pure skies with sacred feathers clift; On Libanon at first his foot he set, And shook his wings with rory May dews wet.  XV Then to Tortosa’s confines swiftly sped The sacred messenger, with headlong flight; Above the eastern wave appeared red The rising sun, yet scantly half in sight; Godfrey e’en then his morn-devotions said, As was his custom, when with Titan bright Appeared the angel in his shape divine, Whose glory far obscured Phoebus’ shine.  XVI “Godfrey,” quoth he, “behold the season fit To war, for which thou waited hast so long, Now serves the time, if thou o’erslip not it, To free Jerusalem from thrall and wrong: Thou with thy Lords in council quickly sit; Comfort the feeble, and confirm the strong, The Lord of Hosts their general doth make thee, And for their chieftain they shall gladly take thee.  XVII “I, messenger from everlasting Jove, In his great name thus his behests do tell; Oh, what sure hope of conquest ought thee move, What zeal, what love should in thy bosom dwell!” This said, he vanished to those seats above, In height and clearness which the rest excel, Down fell the Duke, his joints dissolved asunder, Blind with the light, and strucken dead with wonder.  XVIII But when recovered, he considered more, The man, his manner, and his message said; If erst he wished, now he longed sore To end that war, whereof he Lord was made; Nor swelled his breast with uncouth pride therefore, That Heaven on him above this charge had laid, But, for his great Creator would the same, His will increased: so fire augmenteth flame.  XIX The captains called forthwith from every tent, Unto the rendezvous he them invites; Letter on letter, post on post he sent, Entreatance fair with counsel he unites, All, what a noble courage could augment, The sleeping spark of valor what incites, He used, that all their thoughts to honor raised, Some praised, some paid, some counselled, all pleased.  XX The captains, soldiers, all, save Boemond, came, And pitched their tents, some in the fields without, Some of green boughs their slender cabins frame, Some lodged were Tortosa’s streets about, Of all the host the chief of worth and name Assembled been, a senate grave and stout; Then Godfrey, after silence kept a space, Lift up his voice, and spake with princely grace:  XXI “Warriors, whom God himself elected hath His worship true in Sion to restore, And still preserved from danger, harm and scath, By many a sea and many an unknown shore, You have subjected lately to his faith Some provinces rebellious long before: And after conquests great, have in the same Erected trophies to his cross and name.  XXII “But not for this our homes we first forsook, And from our native soil have marched so far: Nor us to dangerous seas have we betook, Exposed to hazard of so far sought war, Of glory vain to gain an idle smook, And lands possess that wild and barbarous are: That for our conquests were too mean a prey, To shed our bloods, to work our souls’ decay.  XXIII “But this the scope was of our former thought,— Of Sion’s fort to scale the noble wall, The Christian folk from bondage to have brought, Wherein, alas, they long have lived thrall, In Palestine an empire to have wrought, Where godliness might reign perpetual, And none be left, that pilgrims might denay To see Christ’s tomb, and promised vows to pay.  XXIV “What to this hour successively is done Was full of peril, to our honor small, Naught to our first designment, if we shun The purposed end, or here lie fixed all. What boots it us there wares to have begun, Or Europe raised to make proud Asia thrall, If our beginnings have this ending known, Not kingdoms raised, but armies overthrown?  XXV “Not as we list erect we empires new On frail foundations laid in earthly mould, Where of our faith and country be but few Among the thousands stout of Pagans bold, Where naught behoves us trust to Greece untrue, And Western aid we far removed behold: Who buildeth thus, methinks, so buildeth he, As if his work should his sepulchre be.  XXVI “Turks, Persians conquered, Antiochia won, Be glorious acts, and full of glorious praise, By Heaven’s mere grace, not by our prowess done: Those conquests were achieved by wondrous ways, If now from that directed course we run The God of Battles thus before us lays, His loving kindness"]]]
