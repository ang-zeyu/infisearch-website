Perchance, on beholding the cloudy pillar and fiery column, they      whispered awe-stricken to one another, 'In its shape it is like      that old obelisk which we and our fathers have so often seen on the      borders of the Nile.' And now that very obelisk, with hardly a      trace of decay upon it, is the first thing that the modern      traveller sees after entering the Flaminian Gate.\"--_Hawthorne's      Transformation._  It was on the left of the Piazza, at the foot of what was even then called \"the Hill of Gardens,\" that Nero was buried (A.D. 68).       \"When Nero was dead, his nurse Eclaga, with Alexandra, and Acte the      famous concubine, having wrapped his remains in rich white stuff,      embroidered with gold, deposited them in the Domitian monument,      which is seen in the Campus-Martius under the Hill of Gardens. The      tomb was of porphyry, having an altar of Luna marble, surrounded by      a balustrade of Thasos marble.\"--_Suetonius._  Church tradition tells that from the tomb of Nero afterwards grew a gigantic walnut-tree, which became the resort of innumerable crows,--so numerous as to become quite a pest to the neighbourhood. In the eleventh century, Pope Paschal II. dreamt that these crows were demons, and that the Blessed Virgin commanded him to cut down and burn the tree (\"albero malnato\"), and build a sanctuary to her honour in its place. A church was then built by means of a collection amongst the common people; hence the name which it still retains of \"St. Mary of the People.\"  _Sta. Maria del Popolo_ was rebuilt by Bacio Pintelli for Sixtus IV. in 1480, and very richly adorned. It was modernized by Bernini for Alexander VII. (Fabio Chigi, 1655-67), of whom it was the family burial-place, but it still retains many fragments of beautiful fifteenth century work (the principal door of the nave is a fine example of this); and its interior is a perfect museum of sculpture and art.  Entering the church by the west door, and following the right aisle, the first chapel (Venuti, formerly Della Rovere[3]) is adorned with exquisite paintings by _Pinturicchio_. Over the altar is the Nativity--one of the most beautiful frescoes in the city; in the lunettes are scenes from the life of St. Jerome. Cardinal Christoforo della Rovere, who built this chapel and dedicated it to \"the Virgin and St. Jerome,\" is buried on the left, in a grand fifteenth century tomb; on the right is the monument of Cardinal di Castro. Both of these tombs and many others in this church have interesting and greatly varied lunettes of the Virgin and Child.  The second chapel, of the Cibo family, rich in pillars of nero-antico and jasper, has an altarpiece representing the Assumption of the Virgin, by _Carlo Maratta_. In the cupola is the Almighty, surrounded by the heavenly host.[4]  The third chapel is also painted by _Pinturicchio_. Over the altar, the Madonna and four saints; above, God the Father, surrounded by angels. In the other lunettes, scenes in the life of the Virgin;--that of the Virgin studying in the Temple, a very rare subject, is especially beautiful. In a frieze round the lower part of the wall, a series of martyrdoms in grisaille. On the right is the tomb of Giovanni della Rovere, ob. 1483. On the left is a fine sleeping bronze figure of a bishop, unknown.  The fourth chapel has a fine fifteenth century altar-relief of St. Catherine between St. Anthony of Padua and St. Vincent. On the right is the tomb of Marc-Antonio Albertoni, ob. 1485; on the left, that of Cardinal Costa, of Lisbon, ob. 1508, erected in his lifetime. In this tomb is an especially beautiful lunette of the Virgin adored by Angels.  Entering the right transept, on the right is the tomb of Cardinal Podocanthorus of Cyprus, a very fine specimen of fifteenth century work. A door near this leads into a cloister, where is preserved, over a door, the Gothic altar-piece of the church of Sixtus IV, representing the Coronation of the Virgin, and two fine tombs--Archbishop Rocca, ob. 1482, and Bishop Gomiel.  The choir (shown when there is no service) has a ceiling by _Pinturicchio_. In the centre, the Virgin and Saviour, surrounded by the Evangelists and Sibyls; in the corners, the Fathers of the Church--Gregory, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine. Beneath are the tombs of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and Cardinal Girolamo Basso, nephews of Sixtus IV. (Francesco della Rovere), beautiful works of _Andrea di Sansovino_. These tombs were erected at the expense of Julius II., himself a Della Rovere, who also gave the windows, painted by _Claude and Guillaume de Marseilles_, the only good specimens of stained glass in Rome.  The high-altar is surmounted by a miraculous image of the Virgin, inscribed, \"In honorificentia populi nostri,\" which was placed in this church by Gregory IX., and which, having been \"successfully invoked\" by Gregory XIII., in the great plague of 1578, has ever since been annually adored by the pope of the period, who prostrates himself before it upon the 8th of September. The chapel on the left of this has an Assumption, by _Annibale Caracci_.  In the left transept is the tomb of Cardinal Bernardino Lonati, with a fine fifteenth century relief of the Resurrection.  Returning by the left aisle, the last chapel but one is that of the Chigi family, in which the famous banker, Agostino Chigi (who built the Farnesina) is buried, and in which _Raphael_ is represented at once as a painter, a sculptor, and an architect. He planned the chapel itself; he drew the strange design of the Mosaic on the ceiling (carried out by _Aloisio della Pace_), which represents an extraordinary mixture of Paganism and Christianity, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (as the planets), conducted by angels, being represented with and surrounding Jehovah; and he modelled the beautiful statue of Jonah seated on the whale, which was sculptured in the marble by _Lorenzetto_. The same artist sculptured the figure of Elijah,--those of Daniel and Habakkuk being by _Bernini_. The altarpiece, representing the Nativity of the Virgin, is a fine work of _Sebastian del Piombo_. On the pier adjoining this chapel is the strange monument by _Posi_ (1771) of a Princess Odescalchi Chigi, who died in childbirth, at the age of twenty, erected by her husband, who describes himself, \"In solitudine et luctu superstes.\"  The last chapel contains two fine fifteenth century ciboria, and the tomb of Cardinal Antonio Pallavicini, 1507.  On the left of the principal entrance is the remarkable monument of Gio. Batt. Gislenus, the companion and friend of Casimir I. of Poland (ob. 1670). At the top is his portrait while living, inscribed, \"Neque hic vivus\"; then a medallion of a chrysalis, \"In nidulo meo moriar\"; opposite to which is a medallion of a butterfly emerging, \"Ut Phœnix multiplicabo dies\": below is a hideous skeleton of giallo antico in a white marble winding-sheet, \"Neque hic mortuus.\"       Martin Luther \"often spoke of death as the Christian's true birth,      and this life as but a growing into the chrysalis-shell in which      the spirit lives till its being is developed, and it bursts the      shell, casts off the web, struggles into life, spreads its wings,      and soars up to God.\"  The Augustine Convent adjoining this church was the residence of Luther while he was in Rome. Here he celebrated mass immediately on his arrival, after he had prostrated himself upon the earth, saying, \"Hail sacred Rome! thrice sacred for the blood of the martyrs shed here!\" Here, also, he celebrated mass for the last time before he departed from Rome to become the most terrible of her enemies.       \"Lui pauvre écolier, élevé si durement, qui souvent, pendant son      enfance, n'avait pour oreiller qu'une dalle froide, il passe devant      des temples tout de marbre, devant des colonnes d'albâtre, des      gigantesques obélisques de granite, des fontaines jaillissantes,      des _villas_ fraîches et embellies de jardins, de fleurs, de      cascades et de grottes. Veut-il prier? il entre dans une église qui      lui semble un monde véritable, où les diamants scintillent sur      l'autel, l'or aux soffites, le marbre aux colonnes, la mosaïque aux      chapelles, au lieu d'un de ces temples rustiques qui n'ont dans sa      patrie pour tout ornement que quelques roses qu'une main pieuse va      déposer sur l'autel le jour du dimanche. Est-il fatigué de la      route? il trouve sur son chemin, non plus un modeste banc de bois,      mais un siège d'albâtre antique récemment déterré. Cherche-t-il une      sainte image? il n'aperçoit que des fantaisies païennes, des      divinités olympiques, Apollon, Vénus, Mars, Jupiter, auxquelles      travaillent mille mains de sculpteurs. De toutes ces merveilles, il      ne comprit rien, il ne vit rien. Aucun rayon de la couronne de      Raphaël, de Michel-Ange, n'éblouit ses regards; il resta froid et      muet devant tous les trésors de peinture et de sculpture rassemblés      dans les églises; son oreille fut fermée aux chants du Dante, que      le peuple répétait autour de lui. Il était entré à Rome en pèlerin,      il en sort comme Coriolan, et s'écrie avec Bembo: 'Adieu, Rome, que      doit fuir quiconque veut vivre saintement! Adieu, ville où tout est      permis, excepté d'être homme de bien.'\"--_Audin, Histoire de      Luther_, c. ii.  It was in front of this church that the cardinals and magnates of Rome met to receive the apostate Christina of Sweden upon her entrance into the city.         *       *       *       *       *  On the left side of the piazza rise the terraces of the Pincio, adorned with rostral-columns, statues, and marble bas-reliefs, interspersed with cypresses and pines.

Hence the Eternal City is seen spread at our feet, and beyond it the wide-spreading Campagna, till a silver line marks the sea melting into the horizon beyond Ostia. All these churches and tall palace roofs become more than mere names in the course of the winter, but at first all is bewilderment Two great buildings alone arrest the attention:       \"Westward, beyond the Tiber, is the Castle of St. Angelo, the      immense tomb of a pagan emperor with the archangel on its      summit.... Still further off, a mighty pile of buildings,      surmounted by a vast dome, which all of us have shaped and swelled      outward, like a huge bubble, to the utmost scope of our      imaginations, long before we see it floating over the worship of      the city. At any nearer view the grandeur of St. Peter's hides      itself behind the immensity of its separate parts, so that we only      see the front, only the sides, only the pillared length and      loftiness of the portico, and not the mighty whole. But at this      distance the entire outline of the world's cathedral, as well as      that of the palace of the world's chief priest, is taken in at      once. In such remoteness, moreover, the imagination is not debarred      from rendering its assistance, even while we have the reality      before our eyes, and helping the weakness of human sense to do      justice to so grand an object. It requires both faith and fancy to      enable us to feel, what is nevertheless so true, that yonder, in      front of the purple outline of the hills, is the grandest edifice      ever built by man, painted against God's loveliest      sky.\"--_Hawthorne._  Here the band plays under the great palm-tree every afternoon except Friday. On Sunday afternoons the Pincio is in what Miss Thackeray describes as \"a fashionable halo of sunset and pink parasols\"--when immense crowds collect, showing every phase of Roman life; and disperse again as the Ave-Maria bell rings from the churches, either to descend into the city, or to hear benediction sung by the nuns in the Trinità de' Monti.       \"When the fashionable hour of rendezvous arrives, the same spot,      which a few minutes before was immersed in silence and solitude,      changes as it were with the rapidity of a scene in a pantomime to      an animated panorama. The scene is rendered not a little ludicrous      by the miniature representation of the Ring in Hyde Park in a small      compass. An entire revolution of the carriage-drive is performed in      the short period of three minutes as near as may be, and the      perpetual occurrence of the same physiognomies and the same      carriages trotting round and round for two successive hours,      necessarily reminds one of the proceedings of a country fair, and      children whirling in a roundabout.\"--_Sir G. Head's 'Tour in      Rome.'_       \"The Pincian Hill is the favourite promenade of the Roman      aristocracy. At the present day, however, like most other Roman      possessions, it belongs less to the native inhabitants than to the      barbarians from Gaul, Great Britain, and beyond the sea, who have      established a peaceful usurpation over all that is enjoyable or      memorable in the Eternal City. These foreign guests are indeed      ungrateful, if they do not breathe a prayer for Pope Clement, or      whatever Holy Father it may have been, who levelled the summit of      the mount so skilfully, and bounded it with the parapet of the city      wall; who laid out those broad walks and drives, and overhung them      with the shade of many kinds of tree; who scattered the flowers of      all seasons, and of every clime, abundantly over those smooth,      central lawns; who scooped out hollows in fit places, and setting      great basons of marble in them, caused ever-gushing fountains to      fill them to the brim; who reared up the immemorial obelisk out of      the soil that had long hidden it; who placed pedestals along the      borders of the avenues, and covered them with busts of that      multitude of worthies,--statesmen, heroes, artists, men of letters      and of song,--whom the whole world claims as its chief ornaments,      though Italy has produced them all. In a word, the Pincian garden      is one of the things that reconcile the stranger (since he fully      appreciates the enjoyment, and feels nothing of the cost,) to the      rule of an irresponsible dynasty of Holy Fathers, who seem to have      arrived at making life as agreeable an affair as it can well be.       \"In this pleasant spot the red-trousered French soldiers are always      to be seen; bearded and grizzled veterans, perhaps, with medals of      Algiers or the Crimea on their breasts. To them is assigned the      peaceful duty of seeing that children do not trample on the      flower-beds, nor any youthful lover rifle them of their fragrant      blossoms to stick in his beloved one's hair. Here sits (drooping      upon some marble bench, in the treacherous sunshine,) the      consumptive girl, whose friends have brought her, for a cure, into      a climate that instils poison into its very purest breath. Here,      all day, come nursery maids, burdened with rosy English babies, or      guiding the footsteps of little travellers from the far western      world. Here, in the sunny afternoon, roll and rumble all kinds of      carriages, from the Cardinal's old-fashioned and gorgeous purple      carriage to the gay barouche of modern date. Here horsemen gallop      on thorough-bred steeds. Here, in short, all the transitory      population of Rome, the world's great watering-place, rides,      drives, or promenades! Here are beautiful sunsets; and here,      whichever way you turn your eyes, are scenes as well worth gazing      at, both in themselves and for their historical interest, as any      that the sun ever rose and set upon. Here, too, on certain      afternoons in the week, a French military band flings out rich      music over the poor old city, floating her with strains as loud as      those of her own echoless triumphs.\"--_Hawthorne._  The garden of the Pincio is very small, but beautifully laid out. At a crossroads is placed an _Obelisk_, brought from Egypt, and which the late discoveries in hieroglyphics show to have been erected there, in the joint names of Hadrian and his empress Sabina, to their beloved Antinous, who was drowned in the Nile A.D. 131.  From the furthest angle of the garden we look down upon the strange fragment of wall known as the _Muro-Torto_.       \"Le Muro-Torto offre un souvenir curieux. On nomme ainsi un pan de      muraille qui, avant de faire partie du rempart d'Honorius, avait      servi à soutenir la terrasse du jardin du Domitius, et qui, du      temps de Bélisaire, était déjà incliné comme il l'est aujourd'hui.      Procope racconte que Bélisaire voulait le rebâtir, mais que les      Romains l'en empêchèrent, affirmant que ce point n'était pas      exposé, parce que Saint Pierre avait promis de le défendre. Procope      ajoute: 'Personne n'a osé réparer ce mur, et il reste encore dans      le même état.' Nous pouvons en dire autant que Procope, et le mur,      détaché de la colline à laquelle il s'appuyait, reste encore      incliné et semble près de tomber. Ce détail du siége de Rome est      confirmé par l'aspect singulier du Muro-Torto, qui _semble toujours      près de tomber_, et subsiste dans le même état depuis quatorze      siècles, comme s'il était soutenu miraculeusement par la main de      Saint Pierre. On ne saurait guère trouver pour l'autorité temporel      des papes, un meilleur symbole.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 397.       \"At the furthest point of the Pincio, you look down from the      parapet upon the Muro-Torto, a massive fragment of the oldest Roman      wall, which juts over, as if ready to tumble down by its own      weight, yet seems still the most indestructible piece of work that      men's hands ever piled together. In the blue distance rise Soracte,      and other heights, which have gleamed afar, to our imagination, but      look scarcely real to our bodily eyes, because, being dreamed about      so much, they have taken the aerial tints which belong only to a      dream. These, nevertheless, are the solid framework of hills that      shut in Rome, and its broad surrounding Campagna; no land of      dreams, but the broadest page of history, crowded so full with      memorable events, that one obliterates another, as if Time had      crossed and recrossed his own records till they grew      illegible.\"--_Hawthorne._  In early imperial times the site of the Pincio garden was occupied by the famous villa of Lucullus, who had gained his enormous wealth as general of the Roman armies in Asia.       \"The life of Lucullus was like an ancient comedy, where first we      see great actions, both political and military, and afterwards      feasts, debauches, races by torchlight, and every kind of frivolous      amusement. For among frivolous amusements, I cannot but reckon his      sumptuous villas, walks, and baths; and still more so the      paintings, statues, and other works of art which he collected at      immense expense, idly squandering away upon them the vast fortune      he amassed in the wars. Insomuch that now, when luxury is so much      advanced, the gardens of Lucullus rank with those of the kings, and      are esteemed the most magnificent even of these.\"--_Plutarch._  Here, in his Pincian villa, Lucullus gave his celebrated feast to Cicero and Pompey, merely mentioning to a slave beforehand that he should sup in the hall of Apollo, which was understood as a command to prepare all that was most sumptuous.       After Lucullus--the beautiful Pincian villa belonged to Valerius      Asiaticus, and in the reign of Claudius was coveted by his fifth      wife, Messalina. She"]]]
