This small Wren is rarely seen, being nowhere common, although widely distributed. It prefers open grounds covered with dense reeds and grasses, where it easily escapes observation. I have met with it near Buenos Ayres city; also on the desert pampas, in the tall pampas-grass. It is likewise met with along the Paraná river, and in Chili, Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands. In the last-named locality Darwin found it common, and says that it has there an extremely feeble flight, so that it may easily be run down and taken.  The Marsh-Wren has a sweet and delicate song, resembling that of the House-Wren (_Troglodytes furvus_), but much less powerful. It does not migrate; and on the pampas I have heard it singing with great animation when the pampas-grass, where it sat perched, was white with frozen dew. Probably its song, like that of _Troglodytes furvus_, varies in different districts; at all events, the pampas bird does not possess so fine a song as Azara ascribes to his \"Todo Voz\" in Paraguay, which is undoubtedly the same species.     Fam. V. MOTACILLIDÆ, or WAGTAILS.   The Wagtails and Pipits are closely-allied forms, and are usually referred to the same family of Oscines. The Wagtails are restricted to the Old World, although it has been recently ascertained that some of them occasionally occur as stragglers in the northern latitudes of America. Of the almost cosmopolitan Pipits about eight or nine species are sparingly distributed over the prairies and pampas of the New World. One of these is a common resident in the pampas of Argentina, and another (perhaps somewhat doubtful species) is occasionally met with.   15. ANTHUS CORRENDERA, Vieill.

La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 474 (Mendoza, Paraná);       _Durnford, Ibis_, 1876, p. 158.      _Description._--Above pale sandy buff, mottled with black centres     to the feathers; wing- and tail-feathers dark brown, edged with     buff, the penultimate tail-feather with a white tip, the outer     tail-feather almost entirely white; neck and breast sandy buff, with     large triangular black spots; flanks buff, streaked with black;     abdomen and under tail-coverts isabelline; bill dusky grey; feet     pink: total length 6·0 inches, wing 2·9, tail 2·3. _Female_ similar.  _Hab._ Paraguay, Argentina, Patagonia, and Chili.  Azara's only reason for calling this bird _La Correndera_ was because he thought it resembled a Tit-Lark known by that name in his own country, but of which he merely had a confused recollection. It is therefore to be regretted, I think, that _correndera_ has been adopted as a specific name by naturalists instead of \"Cachila,\" the vernacular name of the bird, familiar to every one in the Argentine country. Azara's Spanish bird was probably _Anthus pratensis_, which closely resembles _A. correndera_ in general appearance, and has, moreover, as wide a range in the northern as the last-named species has in the southern hemisphere. In the volume on Birds in the 'Voyage of the Beagle,' it is said that a species of _Anthus_ ranges further south than any other land-bird, being the only land-bird found on Georgia and South Orkney (lat. 61° S.).  In colour and language, possibly also in size, the Cachila is variable. It is a very common bird, widely and plentifully distributed over the pampas, found alike on marshy and dry grounds, but rare in the region of giant grasses. While abundant, it is also very evenly dispersed, each bird spending its life on a very circumscribed plot of earth. Those frequenting marshy or moist grounds are of a yellowish-cream colour, thickly mottled and striped with fuscous and black, and have two narrow parallel pure white marks on the back, very conspicuous when the bird is on the ground. The individuals frequenting high and dry grounds are much paler in hue, appearing almost grey, and do not show the white marks on the back. They also look larger than the birds on marshy lands; but this appearance is probably due to a looser plumage. The most strongly-marked pale and dark-plumaged variations may be found living within a few hundred yards of each other, showing how strictly each bird keeps to its own little \"beat\"; for this difference in coloration is, no doubt, due entirely to the amount of moisture in the ground they live on.  The Cachilas are resident, living in couples all the year round, the sexes being faithful. Several pairs frequent a small area, and sometimes they unite in a desultory flock; but these gatherings are not frequent. In the evening, at all seasons, immediately after the sun has set, the Cachilas all rise to a considerable height in the air and fly wildly about, chirping for a few minutes, after which they retire to roost.  When approached they frequently rise up several feet from the ground and flutter in the air, chirping sharply, with breast towards the intruder. This is a habit also found in Synallaxine species inhabiting the grassy plains. But, as a rule, the Cachilas are the tamest of feathered creatures, and usually creep reluctantly away on their little pink feet when approached. If the pedestrian is a stranger to their habits they easily delude him into attempting their capture with his hat, so little is their fear of man.  To sing, the Cachila mounts upwards almost vertically, making at intervals a fluttering pause, accompanied with a few hurried notes. When he has thus risen to a great height (but never beyond sight as Azara says) he begins the descent slowly, the wings inclining upwards; and, descending, he pours forth long impressive strains, each ending with a falling inflection or with two or three short throat-notes as the bird pauses fluttering in mid-air, and then renewed successively until, when the singer is within 3 or 4 feet of the earth, without alighting he reascends as before to continue the performance. It is a very charming melody, and heard always on the treeless plains when there is no other bird-music, with the exception of the trilling and grasshopper-like notes of a few Synallaxine species. But in character it is utterly unlike the song of the Sky-Lark with its boundless energy, hurry, and abandon; and yet it is impossible not to think of the Sky-Lark when describing the Cachila, which, in its manners, appearance, and in its habit of soaring to a great height when singing, seems so like a small copy of that bird.  The Cachila rears two broods in the year; the first is hatched about the middle of August, that is, one to three months before the laying-season of other Passerine species. By anticipating the breeding-season their early nests escape the evil of parasitical eggs; but, on the other hand, frosty nights and heavy rains are probably as fatal to as many early broods as the instinct of the _Molothrus bonariensis_, or Cow-bird, is to others at a later period.  The second brood is reared in December, the hottest month, and in that season a large proportion of their nests contain parasitical eggs.  The nest is placed in a slight hollow in the ground, under a tussock of grass, and is sometimes elaborately made and lined with horsehair and fine grass, and sometimes with a few materials loosely put together. During the solstitial heats I have frequently found nests with frail shades, built of sticks and grass, over them, the short withered grass affording an insufficient protection from the meridian sun. The eggs are four, elongated, with a dirty white and sometimes a dull bluish ground, thickly spotted with dusky brown and drab. In some eggs the spots are confluent, the whole shell being of a dull brownish-drab colour.  The manners of this species, where I have observed it, are always the same; it lives on the ground on open plains, where the herbage and grass is short, and never perches on trees. The song varies considerably in different districts.   16. ANTHUS FURCATUS, d'Orb. et Lafr.  (FORKED-TAIL PIPIT.)    +Anthus furcatus+, _d'Orb. Voy._ p. 227 (Patagonia); _Darwin, Zool.       Voy.

One of the Pipits procured at Conchitas belongs to this species, if distinct from the former. I think I recollect it as a resident on the pampas, closely resembling the Cachila in flight and language, but much shyer, and usually found concealed under Tulu grass on dry grounds.     Fam. VI.

Originated by the Board of Admiralty, over which Viscount Melville presided, these voyages have been carried on, since 1830, under his lordship's successors in office.  Captain King has authorized me to lay the results of the Expedition which he commanded, from 1826 to 1830, before your lordship, united to those of the Beagle's subsequent voyages.    I have the honour to be,           MY LORD,     Your lordship's obedient servant,                   ROBERT FITZ-ROY.         *       *       *       *       *   {ix}  PREFACE.  In this Work, the result of nine years' voyaging, partly on coasts little known, an attempt has been made to combine giving general information with the paramount object--that of fulfilling a duty to the Admiralty, for the benefit of Seamen.  Details, purely technical, have been avoided in the narrative more than I could have wished; but some are added in the Appendix to each volume: and in a nautical memoir, drawn up for the Admiralty, those which are here omitted will be found.  There are a few words used frequently in the following pages, which may not at first sight be familiar to every reader, therefore I need hardly apologize for saying that, although the great Portuguese navigator's name was Magalhaens--it is generally pronounced as if written Magellan:--that the natives of Tierra del Fuego are commonly called Fuegians;--and that Chilóe is thus accented for reasons given in page 384 of the second volume.  In the absence of Captain King, who has entrusted to me the care of publishing his share of this work, I may have overlooked errors which he would have detected. Being hurried, and unwell, while attending to the printing of his volume, I was not able to do it justice.  {x}  It may be a subject of regret, that no paper on the Botany of Tierra del Fuego is appended to the first volume. Captain King took great pains in forming and preserving a botanical collection, aided by a person embarked solely for that purpose. He placed this collection in the British Museum, and was led to expect that a first-rate botanist would have examined and described it; but he has been disappointed.  In conclusion, I beg to remind the reader, that the work is unavoidably of a rambling and very mixed character; that some parts may be wholly uninteresting to most readers, though, perhaps, not devoid of interest to all; and that its publication arises solely from a sense of duty.  ROBERT FITZ-ROY.    London, March 1839.         *       *       *       *       *   {xi}  INTRODUCTION  In 1825, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty directed two ships to be prepared for a Survey of the Southern Coasts of South America; and in May, of the following year, the ADVENTURE and the BEAGLE were lying in Plymouth Sound, ready to carry the orders of their Lordships into execution.  These vessels were well provided with every necessary, and every comfort, which the liberality and kindness of the Admiralty, Navy Board, and officers of the Dock-yards, could cause to be furnished.  On board the Adventure, a roomy ship, of 330 tons burthen, without guns,[1] lightly though strongly rigged, and very strongly built, were--    PHILLIP PARKER KING, Commander and Surveyor, Senior   Officer of the Expedition.    J. COOKE              Lieutenant.   B. AINSWORTH          Master.   J. TARN               Surgeon.   {xii}   G. ROWLETT            Purser.   R. H. SHOLL           Mate.   J. C.

Serjeant and fourteen Marines; and about forty Seamen and   Boys.  In the Beagle, a well-built little vessel, of 235 tons, rigged as a barque, and carrying six guns, were--    PRINGLE STOKES          Commander and Surveyor.   E. HAWES                Lieutenant.   W.

MACDOUALL            Clerk.    Carpenter.    Serjeant and nine Marines; and about forty Seamen and Boys.  {xiii}  In the course of the voyage, several changes occurred among the officers, which it may be well to mention here.  In September, 1826, Lieutenant Hawes invalided: and was succeeded by Mr. R. H. Sholl, the senior mate in the Expedition.  In February, 1827, Mr. Ainsworth was unfortunately drowned; and, in his place, Mr. Williams acted, until superseded by Mr. S. S. Flinn, of the Beagle.  Lieutenant Cooke invalided in June, 1827; and was succeeded by Mr. J. C. Wickham.  In the same month Mr. Graves received information of his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant.  Between May and December, 1827, Mr. Bowen and Mr. Atrill invalided; besides Messrs. Lunie, Jones, and Macdouall: Mr. W. Mogg joined the Beagle, as acting Purser; and Mr. D. Braily, as volunteer of the second class.  Mr. Bynoe acted as Surgeon of the Beagle, after Mr. Bowen left, until December, 1828.  In August, 1828, Captain Stokes's lamented vacancy was temporarily filled by Lieutenant Skyring; whose place was taken by Mr. Brand.  Mr. Flinn was then removed to the Adventure; and Mr. A. Millar put into his place.  {xiv}  In December, 1828, the Commander-in-chief of the Station (Sir Robert Waller Otway) superseded the temporary arrangements of Captain King, and appointed a commander, lieutenant, master, and surgeon to the Beagle. Mr. Brand then invalided, and the lists of officers stood thus--    Adventure (1828-30).    PHILLIP PARKER KING, Commander and Surveyor, Senior   Officer of the Expedition.    T.

Millar died very suddenly:--and very much regretted.  The following Instructions were given to the Senior Officer of the Expedition.  \"By the Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.  \"Whereas we think fit that an accurate Survey should be made of the Southern Coasts of the Peninsula of South America, from the southern entrance of the River Plata, round to Chilóe; and of Tierra del Fuego; and whereas we have been induced to repose confidence in you, from your conduct of the Surveys in New Holland; we have placed you in the command of His Majesty's Surveying Vessel the Adventure; and we have directed Captain Stokes, of His Majesty's Surveying Vessel the Beagle, to follow your orders.  \"Both these vessels are provided with all the {xvi} means which are necessary for the complete"]]]
