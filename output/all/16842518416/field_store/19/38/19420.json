As detective-sergeant, he found his horizon enlarged. There was more scope for a man of parts. Things moved more rapidly. The world seemed full of philanthropists, anxious to \"dress his front\" and do him other little kindnesses. Mr. McEachern was no churl. He let them dress his front. He accepted the little kindnesses. Presently, he found that he had fifteen thousand dollars to spare for any small flutter that might take his fancy. Singularly enough, this was the precise sum necessary to make him a captain.  He became a captain. And it was then that he discovered that El Dorado was no mere poet's dream, and that Tom Tiddler's Ground, where one might stand picking up gold and silver, was as definite a locality as Brooklyn or the Bronx. At last, after years of patient waiting, he stood like Moses on the mountain, looking down into the Promised Land. He had come to where the Big Money was.  The captain was now reading the little note-book wherein he kept a record of his investments, which were numerous and varied. That the contents were satisfactory was obvious at a glance. The smile on his face and the reposeful position of his jaw were proof enough of that. There were notes relating to house-property, railroad shares, and a dozen other profitable things. He was a rich man.  This was a fact that was entirely unsuspected by his neighbors, with whom he maintained somewhat distant relations, accepting no invitations and giving none. For Mr. McEachern was playing a big game. Other eminent buccaneers in his walk of life had been content to be rich men in a community where moderate means were the rule. But about Mr. McEachern there was a touch of the Napoleonic. He meant to get into society--and the society he had selected was that of England. Other people have noted the fact--which had impressed itself very firmly on the policeman's mind--that between England and the United States there are three thousand miles of deep water. In the United States, he would be a retired police-captain; in England, an American gentleman of large and independent means with a beautiful daughter.  That was the ruling impulse in his life--his daughter Molly. Though, if he had been a bachelor, he certainly would not have been satisfied to pursue a humble career aloof from graft, on the other hand, if it had not been for Molly, he would not have felt, as he gathered in his dishonest wealth, that he was conducting a sort of holy war. Ever since his wife had died, in his detective-sergeant days, leaving him with a year-old daughter, his ambitions had been inseparably connected with Molly.  All his thoughts were on the future. This New York life was only a preparation for the splendors to come. He spent not a dollar unnecessarily. When Molly was home from school, they lived together simply and quietly in the small house which Molly's taste made so comfortable. The neighbors, knowing his profession and seeing the modest scale on which he lived, told one another that here at any rate was a policeman whose hands were clean of graft. They did not know of the stream that poured week by week and year by year into his bank, to be diverted at intervals into the most profitable channels. Until the time should come for the great change, economy was his motto. The expenses of his home were kept within the bounds of his official salary. All extras went to swell his savings.  He closed his book with a contented sigh, and lighted another cigar. Cigars were his only personal luxury. He drank nothing, ate the simplest food, and made a suit of clothes last for quite an unusual length of time; but no passion for economy could make him deny himself smoke.  He sat on, thinking. It was very late, but he did not feel ready for bed. A great moment had arrived in his affairs. For days, Wall Street had been undergoing one of its periodical fits of jumpiness. There had been rumors and counter-rumors, until finally from the confusion there had soared up like a rocket the one particular stock in which he was most largely interested. He had unloaded that morning, and the result had left him slightly dizzy. The main point to which his mind clung was that the time had come at last. He could make the great change now at any moment that suited him.  He was blowing clouds of smoke and gloating over this fact when the door opened, admitting a bull-terrier, a bull-dog, and in the wake of the procession a girl in a kimono and red slippers.     CHAPTER IV  MOLLY   \"Why, Molly,\" said the policeman, \"what are you doing out of bed? I thought you were asleep.\"  He placed a huge arm around her, and drew her to his lap. As she sat there, his great bulk made her seem smaller than she really was. With her hair down and her little red slippers dangling half a yard from the floor, she seemed a child. McEachern, looking at her, found it hard to realize that nineteen years had passed since the moment when the doctor's raised eyebrows had reproved him for his monosyllabic reception of the news that the baby was a girl.  \"Do you know what the time is?\" he said. \"Two o'clock.\"  \"Much too late for you to be sitting here smoking,\" said Molly, severely. \"How many cigars do you smoke a day? Suppose you had married someone who wouldn't let you smoke!\"  \"Never stop your husband smoking, my dear. That's a bit of advice for you when you're married.\"  \"I'm never going to marry. I'm going to stop at home, and darn your socks.\"  \"I wish you could,\" he said, drawing her closer to him. \"But one of these days you're going to marry a prince. And now run back to bed. It's much too late--\"  \"It's no good, father dear. I couldn't get to sleep. I've been trying hard for hours. I've counted sheep till I nearly screamed. It's Rastus' fault. He snores so!\"  Mr. McEachern regarded the erring bull-dog sternly.  \"Why do you have the brutes in your room?\"  \"Why, to keep the boogaboos from getting me, of course. Aren't you afraid of the boogaboos getting you? But you're so big, you wouldn't mind. You'd just hit them. And they're not brutes--are you, darlings? You're angels, and you nearly burst yourselves with joy because auntie had come back from England, didn't you? Father, did they miss me when I was gone? Did they pine away?\"  \"They got like skeletons. We all did.\"  \"You?\"  \"I should say so.\"  \"Then, why did you send me away to England?\"  \"I wanted you to see the country. Did you like it?\"  \"I hated being away from you.\"  \"But you liked the country?\"  \"I loved it.\"  McEachern drew a breath of relief. The only possible obstacle to the great change did not exist.  \"How would you like to go back to England, Molly?\"  \"To England! When I've just come home?\"  \"If I went, too?\"  Molly twisted around so that she could see his face better.  \"There's something the matter with you, father. You're trying to say something, and I want to know what it is. Tell me quick, or I'll make Rastus bite you!\"  \"It won't take long, dear. I've been lucky in some investments while you were away, and I'm going to leave the force, and take you over to England, and find a prince for you to marry--if you think you would like it.\"  \"Father! It'll be perfectly splendid!\"  \"We'll start fair in England, Molly. I'll just be John McEachern, from America, and, if anybody wants to know anything about me, I'm a man who has made money on Wall Street--and that's no lie--and has come over to England to spend it.\"  Molly gave his arm a squeeze. Her eyes were wet.  \"Father, dear,\" she whispered, \"I believe you've been doing it all for me. You've been slaving away for me ever since I was born, stinting yourself and saving money just so that I could have a good time later on.\"  \"No, no!\"  \"It's true,\" she said. She turned on him with a tremulous laugh. \"I don't believe you've had enough to eat for years. I believe you're all skin and bone. Never mind. To-morrow, I'll take you out and buy you the best dinner you've ever had, out of my own money. We'll go to Sherry's, and you shall start at the top of the menu, and go straight down it till you've had enough.\"  \"That will make up for everything. And, now, don't you think you ought to be going to bed? You'll be losing all that color you got on the ship.\"  \"Soon--not just yet. I haven't seen you for such ages!\" She pointed at the bull-terrier. \"Look at Tommy, standing there and staring. He can't believe I've really come back. Father, there was a man on the Lusitania with eyes exactly like Tommy's--all brown and bright--and he used to stand and stare just like Tommy's doing.\"  \"If I had been there,\" said her father wrathfully, \"I'd have knocked his head off.\"  \"No, you wouldn't, because I'm sure he was really a very nice young man. He had a chin rather like yours, father. Besides, you couldn't have got at him to knock his head off, because he was traveling second-class.\"  \"Second-class? Then, you didn't talk with him?\"  \"We couldn't. You wouldn't expect him to shout at me across the railing! Only, whenever I walked round the deck, he seemed to be there.\"  \"Staring!\"  \"He may not have been staring at me. Probably, he was just looking the way the ship was going, and thinking of some girl in New York. I don't think you can make much of a romance out of it, father.\"  \"I don't want to, my dear. Princes don't travel in the second-cabin.\"  \"He may have been a prince in disguise.\"  \"More likely a drummer,\" grunted Mr. McEachern.  \"Drummers are often quite nice, aren't they?\"  \"Princes are nicer.\"  \"Well, I'll go to bed and dream of the nicest one I can think of. Come along, dogs. Stop biting my slipper, Tommy. Why can't you behave, like Rastus? Still, you don't snore, do you? Aren't you going to bed soon, father? I believe you've been sitting up late and getting into all sorts of bad habits while I've been away. I'm sure you have been smoking too much. When you've finished that cigar, you're not even to think of another till to-m"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],["title","The Intrusion of Jimmy (#4)"],["body","orrow. Promise!\"  \"Not one?\"  \"Not one. I'm not going to have my father getting like the people you read about in the magazine advertisements. You don't want to feel sudden shooting pains, do you?\"  \"No, my dear.\"  \"And have to take some awful medicine?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then, promise.\"  \"Very well, my dear. I promise.\"  As the door closed, the captain threw away the stump he was smoking, and remained for a moment in thought. Then, he drew another cigar from his case, lighted it, and resumed the study of the little note-book. It was past three o'clock when he went to his bedroom.     CHAPTER V  A THIEF IN THE NIGHT   How long the light had been darting about the room like a very much enlarged firefly, Jimmy did not know. It seemed to him like hours, for it had woven itself into an incoherent waking dream of his; and for a moment, as the mists of sleep passed away from his brain, he fancied that he was dreaming still. Then, sleep left him, and he realized that the light, which was now moving slowly across the bookcase, was a real light.  That the man behind it could not have been there long was plain, or he would have seen the chair and its occupant. He seemed to be taking the room step by step. As Jimmy sat up noiselessly and gripped the arms of the chair in readiness for a spring, the light passed from the bookcase to the table. Another foot or so to the left, and it would have fallen on Jimmy.  From the position of the ray, Jimmy could see that the burglar was approaching on his side of the table. Though until that day he had not been in the room for two months, its geography was clearly stamped on his mind's eye. He knew almost to a foot where his visitor was standing. Consequently, when, rising swiftly from the chair, he made a football dive into the darkness, it was no speculative dive. It had a conscious aim, and it was not restrained by any uncertainty as to whether the road to the burglar's knees was clear or not.  His shoulder bumped into a human leg. His arms closed instantaneously on it, and pulled. There was a yelp of dismay, and a crash. The lantern bounced away across the room, and wrecked itself on the reef of the steam-heater. Its owner collapsed in a heap on top of Jimmy.  Jimmy, underneath at the fall, speedily put himself uppermost with a twist of his body. He had every advantage. The burglar was a small man, and had been taken very much by surprise, and any fight there might have been in him in normal circumstances had been shaken out of him by the fall. He lay still, not attempting to struggle.  Jimmy half-rose, and, pulling his prisoner by inches to the door, felt up the wall till he found the electric-light button.  The yellow glow that flooded the room disclosed a short, stocky youth of obviously Bowery extraction. A shock of vivid red hair was the first thing about him that caught the eye. A poet would have described it as Titian. Its proprietor's friends and acquaintances probably called it \"carrots.\" Looking up at Jimmy from under this wealth of crimson was a not unpleasing face. It was not handsome, certainly; but there were suggestions of a latent good-humor. The nose had been broken at one period of its career, and one of the ears was undeniably of the cauliflower type; but these are little accidents which may happen to any high-spirited young gentleman. In costume, the visitor had evidently been guided rather by individual taste than by the dictates of fashion. His coat was of rusty black, his trousers of gray, picked out with stains of various colors. Beneath the coat was a faded red-and-white sweater. A hat of soft felt lay on the floor by the table.  The cut of the coat was poor, and the fit of it spoiled by a bulge in one of the pockets. Diagnosing this bulge correctly, Jimmy inserted his hand, and drew out a dingy revolver.  \"Well?\" he said, rising.  Like most people, he had often wondered what he should do if he were to meet a burglar; and he had always come to the conclusion that curiosity would be his chief emotion. His anticipations were proved perfectly correct. Now that he had abstracted his visitor's gun, he had no wish to do anything but engage him in conversation. A burglar's life was something so entirely outside his experience! He wanted to learn the burglar's point of view. Incidentally, he reflected with amusement, as he recalled his wager, he might pick up a few useful hints.  The man on the floor sat up, and rubbed the back of his head ruefully.  \"Gee!\" he muttered. \"I t'ought some guy had t'rown de buildin' at me.\"  \"It was only little me,\" said Jimmy. \"Sorry if I hurt you at all. You really want a mat for that sort of thing.\"  The man's hand went furtively to his pocket. Then, his eye caught sight of the revolver, which Jimmy had placed on the table. With a sudden dash, he seized it.  \"Now, den, boss!\" he said, between his teeth.  Jimmy extended his hand, and unclasped it. Six shells lay in the palm.  \"Why worry?\" he said. \"Sit down and let us talk of life.\"  \"It's a fair cop, boss,\" said the man, resignedly.  \"Away with melancholy,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm not going to call the police. You can beat it whenever you like.\"  The man stared.  \"I mean it,\" said Jimmy. \"What's the trouble? I've no grievance. I wish, though, if you haven't any important engagement, you would stop and talk awhile first.\"  A broad grin spread itself across the other's face. There was something singularly engaging about him when he grinned.  \"Gee! If youse ain't goin' to call de cops, I'll talk till de chickens roost ag'in.\"  \"Talking, however,\" said Jimmy, \"is dry work. Are you by any chance on the wagon?\"  \"What's dat? Me? On your way, boss!\"  \"Then, you'll find a pretty decent whiskey in that decanter. Help yourself. I think you'll like it.\"  A musical gurgling, followed by a contented sigh, showed that the statement had been tested and proved correct.  \"Cigar?\" asked Jimmy.  \"Me fer dat,\" assented his visitor.  \"Take a handful.\"  \"I eats dem alive,\" said the marauder jovially, gathering in the spoils.  Jimmy crossed his legs.  \"By the way,\" he said, \"let there be no secrets between us. What's your name? Mine is Pitt. James Willoughby Pitt.\"  \"Mullins is my monaker, boss. Spike, dey calls me.\"  \"And you make a living at this sort of thing?\"  \"Not so woise.\"  \"How did you get in here?\"  Spike Mullins grinned.  \"Gee! Ain't de window open?\"  \"If it hadn't been?\"  \"I'd a' busted it.\"  Jimmy eyed the fellow fixedly.  \"Can you use an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe?\" he demanded.  Spike was on the point of drinking. He lowered his glass, and gaped.  \"What's dat?\" he said.  \"An oxy-acetylene blow-pipe.\"  \"Search me,\" said Spike, blankly. \"Dat gets past me.\"  Jimmy's manner grew more severe.  \"Can you make soup?\"  \"Soup, boss?\"  \"He doesn't know what soup is,\" said Jimmy, despairingly. \"My good man, I'm afraid you have missed your vocation. You have no business to be trying to burgle. You don't know the first thing about the game.\"  Spike was regarding the speaker with disquiet over his glass. Till now, the red-haired one had been very well satisfied with his methods, but criticism was beginning to sap his nerve. He had heard tales of masters of his craft who made use of fearsome implements such as Jimmy had mentioned; burglars who had an airy acquaintanceship, bordering on insolent familiarity, with the marvels of science; men to whom the latest inventions were as familiar as his own jemmy was to himself. Could this be one of that select band? His host began to take on a new aspect in his eyes.  \"Spike,\" said Jimmy.  \"Huh?\"  \"Have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry, physics--\"  \"On your way, boss!\"  \"--toxicology--\"  \"Search me!\"  \"--electricity and microscopy?\"  \"... Nine, ten. Dat's de finish. I'm down an' out.\"  Jimmy shook his head, sadly.  \"Give up burglary,\" he said. \"It's not in your line. Better try poultry-farming.\"  Spike twiddled his glass, abashed.  \"Now, I,\" said Jimmy airily, \"am thinking of breaking into a house to-night.\"  \"Gee!\" exclaimed Spike, his suspicions confirmed at last. \"I t'ought youse was in de game, boss. Sure, you're de guy dat's onto all de curves. I t'ought so all along.\"  \"I should like to hear,\" said Jimmy amusedly, as one who draws out an intelligent child, \"how you would set about burgling one of those up-town villas. My own work has been on a somewhat larger scale and on the other side of the Atlantic.\"  \"De odder side?\"  \"I have done as much in London, as anywhere else,\" said Jimmy. \"A great town, London, full of opportunities for the fine worker. Did you hear of the cracking of the New Asiatic Bank in Lombard Street?\"  \"No, boss,\" whispered Spike. \"Was dat you?\"  Jimmy laughed.  \"The police would like an answer to the same question,\" he said, self-consciously. \"Perhaps, you heard nothing of the disappearance of the Duchess of Havant's diamonds?\"  \"Wasdat--?\"  \"The thief,\" said Jimmy, flicking a speck of dust from his coat sleeve, \"was discovered to have used an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe.\"  The rapturous intake of Spike's breath was the only sound that broke the silence. Through the smoke, his eyes could be seen slowly widening.  \"But about this villa,\" said Jimmy. \"I am always interested even in the humblest sides of the profession. Now, tell me, supposing you were going to break into a villa, what time of night would you do it?\"  \"I always t'inks it's best either late like dis or when de folks is in at supper,\" said Spike, respectfully.  Jimmy smiled a faint, patronizing smile, and nodded.  \"Well, and what would you do?\"  \"I'd rubber around some to see isn't dere a window open somewheres,\" said Spike, diffidently.  \"And if there wasn't?\"  \"I'd climb up de porch an' into one of de bedrooms,\" said Spike, almost blushing. He felt like a boy reading his first attempts at original poetry to an established critic. What would this master cracksman, this polished wielder of the oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, this expert in toxicology, microscopy and physics think of his callow"]]]
