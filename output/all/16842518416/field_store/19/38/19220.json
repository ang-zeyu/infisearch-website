It is in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater, of Brewer Street, by whom it was received from New Zealand; and who gave me the opportunity of now publishing the accompanying figure and description.  The two extreme points of difference in the Linnæan kingfishers, are seen in the _Alcedo Ispida_, and _A. gigantea_; the last of which has been made into the genus _Dacelo_. It will, nevertheless, be found, that from among the birds left in the old genus, there are a great number, (of which, indeed, this bird is a striking example,) which are much nearer allied to _Dacelo_ than to _Alcedo_, where they now stand. It will appear, therefore, more natural to consider _Halcyon_ and _Dacelo_ as one genus--which may be called by either name, but which must be distinguished by the characters herein given to _Halcyon_, inasmuch as the generic definition of _Dacelo_ (founded on one bird) will be found too restricted to comprehend all.  Total length ten inches; bill two and a half from the gape, and one and a half from the nostrils; the tip of the upper mandible with a slight inclination downwards, and with an appearance of a notch; the whole head, neck, and under plumage, of a delicate fawn colour; under wing covers the same; the remaining upper plumage, with the wings and tail, changeable blue green; ears sea green and dusky, united to a narrow black nuchal collar; wings four inches long, and the tail, which is even, three and a quarter; the hind head is slightly crested, and the feet pale brown.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 68  [Illustration]  POGONIAS rubrifrons,  _Red-fronted Toothbill._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum mediocre, crassum, validum, basi latiore quam altiore,     vibrissis longis incumbentibus tectâ, lateribus ultra basin compressis,     culmine arcuato, subcarinato; mandibulæ superioris margine dentibus 1     vel 2 armato, mandibulæ inferioris marginem obtegente.

The first of these (which are still retained under the old genus,) are natives of Asia; the next in affinity were first characterized by Illiger under the name of _Pogonias_, and are distributed on the African continent; while the prototype genus in America is _Tamatia_ (Cuvier), in which continent not any of the two preceding have been found: thus each quarter of the globe lying within the tropics have their corresponding groups of a family, possessing a general, but at the same time an individuality of character.  I am obliged to Mr. Leadbeater for the opportunity of figuring this new and rare species, which he believes to have come from Sierra Leone. Its total length was six inches; the under-covers of the wings white; the tail two inches long, the feathers broad and even.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 69  [Illustration]  THECLA Galathea,  _Red-bordered Hair-streak._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ clavo elongato, compresso, obtuso terminatæ.

They are an obvious and very natural family, though the species are as yet but little understood, and not one half of them described. I have observed a singular peculiarity in a great many of these insects, which is, that when they are at rest in the sun, the lower wings are constantly in a quick vibrating motion up and down, as if the insect was rubbing them together, more particularly where the two lobes (or obtuse tails) of the under wings meet, though what purpose this is intended to accomplish remains unknown.  The upper surface of the wings in the greatest number of the _Hair streaks_ (as they are aptly called by English collectors) are of various shades of vivid blue, so that the species can only be ascertained from the under markings, which are usually very striking and delicate: they are all of a small size.  This is an African species, and both sexes are in the cabinet of my friend Mr. Haworth.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 70  [Illustration]  CONUS terebra,  _Screw Cone._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _C. cylindraceo-elongatus, albidus, striis transversis elevatis,     fasciisque binis flavescentibus, spirâ crassâ obtusâ._ Lam.

Of this extensive genus Lamarck has written a valuable account in the Annals of the French Museum, where he has rightly pointed out the mistake of Gmelin in placing as varieties of this species, one or two other very distinct shells: the colour of the bands is not always certain, for I have seen specimens in which they were of a dark brown; but the very thick spire, and slender form of the body whirl, with the distant, regular, and greatly elevated striæ, render it a species not easily mistaken, though in general form it comes very near to _C."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39472"],["title","Zoological Illustrations, Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","tella_, and two or three others; the spiral volutions are deeply concave, and the tip and base tinged with violet.  It is a native of the Indian seas.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 71  [Illustration]  STROMBUS mutabilis,  _Little pink-mouthed Strombus._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 10.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _S. anfractu basali nodoso; spirâ brevi tantum non lævi; lineâ sulcatâ     suturæ parallelâ; labio exteriore supra gibbo, margine recto, interiore     crasso, cum exteriore striato; aperturâ pallidè rubicundâ, basi     truncatâ._      Basal whirl nodulous; spire short, nearly smooth, with a sulcated line     parallel with the suture; outer lip above gibbous, the margin straight;     inner lip thick, both striated; aperture flesh colour; base truncated.      _Seba_, _tab._ 61. _fig._ 26 & 27, 32 & 33, 54. _tab._ 62. _fig._ 42 &     43? _Martini_ 3. _tab._ 77, 799. _fig._ 78, 807. _Knorr._ 2, 14. _fig._     3. _Rump._ 37.

It is not an uncommon shell from the East Indies, and seldom grows larger than the figure.         *       *       *       *       *  STROMBUS dilatatus,  _Winged Strombus--middle figures._         *       *       *       *       *  _S. testâ transversè striatâ; spirâ mediocri, plicis numerosis gracilibus; labio exteriore dilatato, rotundato, crassissimo, reflexo; interiore suprà crassescente, medio lævi; aperturâ striatâ._  Shell transversely striated; spire moderate, with slender numerous plaits; outer lip dilated, rounded, very thick, and reflected; inner lip thickened above, smooth in the middle; aperture striated.         *       *       *       *       *  An undescribed species, and of the greatest rarity, for I have never seen any other specimen, than one in my own cabinet, although perfect in form, it is obviously faded in colour; yet it is too remarkable to be mistaken for any other of this interesting family, which requires so much illustration.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 72  [Illustration]  POGONIAS hirsutus,  _Hairy-breasted Toothbill._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 68.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. supra fuscus, maculis sulphureis, subtus sulphureus maculis nigris     interstinctus, capite juguloque nigris; pectoris plumis elongatis,     pilis setaceis terminatis._      Above brown, spotted with sulphur; beneath sulphureous, with black     spots; head and chin black; feathers of the breast lengthened, and     ending in long setaceous hairs.         *       *       *       *       *  I have before observed, that this genus of birds was first characterized under the name of _Pogonias_, by Illiger, in 1811; some years after (1815), M. Vieillot changed the name to _Pogonia_, without taking any notice of Illiger's denomination, and Dr. Leach has followed Vieillot without probably being aware of the plagiarism; Vieillot's name must, however, be expunged, as Mr. Brown has some time back affixed the name of _Pogonia_ to a remarkable genus of plants.  Total length about seven inches; bill blueish black, one inch two lines long, and large in proportion; the tooth in the middle very prominent; behind the eye is a short white stripe, and another much longer begins from the under mandible, and goes half way down the neck; the chin and part of the throat, together with the head and neck above, deep black, which changes to a dark brown on the back, wings, covers, and tail; a small round sulphur spot is on the tip of each feather of the hind head, back, and lesser wing covers; the quills pale brown, margined with sulphur; the under plumage is greenish sulphur, closely spotted with blackish; the most extraordinary peculiarity of this bird consists in the feathers of the breast, which are more rigid than the others, pointed, and the shaft of the lower ones ending in fine incurved setaceous hairs, many of which are near an inch long. The probable use this particular formation is intended for, it is impossible to conjecture.  Mr. B. Leadbeater, to whom I am often obliged for the inspection of rare subjects, received this from Africa, and it is the only individual of the species I ever heard of.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 73  [Illustration]  PSITTACUS pulchellus,  _Turcosine Parrakeet._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. macrourus, suprà viridis, subtùs fulvus; sincipite, genis,     tegminibusque cyaneis, remigibus cæruleis; rectricibus lateralibus     fulvis._      Long-tailed Parrakeet, green above; yellow beneath; forepart of the     head, cheeks, and wing covers light blue; quills deep blue; lateral     tail feathers yellow.      _Shaw, Naturalist's Misc._ 3. _pl._ 96. _Latham, Suppl._ 2. _p._ 88.     _no._ 14.      _La Perruche Edwards, Le Vaillant_, _pl._ 68.

The only representation of the male is in the Naturalist's Miscellany, where it cannot be recognized, and Le Vaillant's is of the female, which differs considerably from the other sex. It is a rare species, and peculiar to New Holland.  Length nine inches, with the tail, which is near four inches and a half; the upper part of the plumage olive green, not so bright as is usual in this tribe; the front of the head is a most brilliant turcosine blue, which spreads on the cheeks, nearly to the ears, and then mixes with the green; the shoulders and lesser wing covers of the same colour, graduating to a deep mazarine blue on the greater covers, spurious wings, and quill feathers, which latter are all deep black beneath, as well as on their interior shafts; at the base of the shoulders is a large irregular patch of dull red, partially hid by the scapulars; the under plumage is yellow, tinged with olive on the throat and breast, and verging towards orange on the belly; tail feathers narrow and pointed, mostly green, with the inner shafts blueish, and margined with black; the three outer on each side nearly yellow, the next tipt only with that colour; under the wings brilliant blue, the greater covers and quills deep black; bill very small; upper mandible without a notch, and blackish; lower very convex, and, with the legs, flesh colour.  The female figured by Le Vaillant is much less brilliant in all its colours, and without the red mark on the shoulders.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 74  [Illustration]  ACHATINA fasciata,  _Chesnut-banded Achatina._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _A. testâ albâ fasciis latis lineisque castaneis ornatâ; spirâ     elongatâ, crassescente; labio interiore semi-circulari, intus depresso;     columellâ truncatâ, emarginatâ._      Shell white, with broad chesnut bands and lines; spire elongated,     thickened; inner lip semi-circular, depressed within; columella     truncated, emarginate.

Gualtieri's figure at _tab._ 6. _fig._ D, is an admirable representation of _A. pallida_, which, not having his work before me at the time, I could not quote; the other at C is a very good one of the present shell. The upper drawing is from one in my own cabinet; the lower is in the possession of Mr. C. Dubois, who is continually adding to his fine and valuable collection.  It is almost unnecessary to contradict the opinion of some writers who have fancied this a _fresh-water_ shell. It is not uncommon, but seldom seen in perfection.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 75  [Illustration]  NATICA spadicea,  _Banded Natica._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa subglobosa seu ovalis, umbilicata.
