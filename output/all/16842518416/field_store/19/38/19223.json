The club of the antennæ is white, tipt with pale brown. The under side of the female very closely resembles the upper, excepting that the black stripe on the lower wings is broken; and there are irregular blotches of white at the tips of both wings, but no marginal spots, as represented by Cramer.  It will be found that _Licinia_ is the connecting genus between those of _Danais_ and _Pieris_, of Latreille, and that the transition between the last of these and _Colias_ is strongly marked by that of Terias, (_Zool. Ill. pl._ 22).  What with the inaccuracy of figures, and the almost universal neglect with which the most eminent entomologists have passed over this beautiful order, the natural arrangement and affinities of the _Lepidoptera_ still remain in the greatest obscurity; and it is recommended to those who may object to the additional generic distinctions I have made, to examine, in the first instance, the relative validity they bear in essential character to the innumerable genera that are continually created in the _Coleoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 92  [Illustration]  PAPILIO,  _Butterfly_         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ graciles, clavis elongatis, obtusis, sub-arcuatis, rarò     compressis.

It has been interwoven in one of their most beautiful allegories, and has been consecrated in our own days by several poets, though by none with such exquisite taste and moral feeling, as by the venerable Historian of the Medici.  So few of those insects, generally called Butterflies, were known to Linnæus, that he included them all in one genus, dividing them, for the most part, into natural groups. Fabricius continued this arrangement, with little variation, and has left us the description of near 1,150 species! Yet before his death, this laborious naturalist saw the absolute necessity of dividing this immense genus into many others, and left among his MSS. a sketch of his proposed arrangement, published afterwards by Illiger, and partially adopted (we venture to think also very imperfectly) by M. Latreille.  The insects which are therefore now left under the old genus _Papilio_, are principally found out of Europe, and are remarkable for their richness of colouring and immense size. M. M. Latreille and Godart have described, with great precision, 146 species: it is, however, to be regretted, that they have adopted no sections or divisions to assist the student in his search after any particular species, among this extensive number. The great disadvantage of this is very obvious, and it has induced me to attempt something like a natural distribution of those insects, which, with every care to avoid an unnatural separation of kindred groups, I am fully aware, in some cases, is very artificial, and it is only offered until a greater knowledge of the larvæ, &c. will enable us to fix on more substantial characters than those I have adopted. This, however, will be a work of time; and until then, I think some guide to the ready knowledge of the species, however objectionable, is better than none.  Much might be said on the affinities which connect this with several other genera. Among the most striking is that existing between them and the _Noctuæ_ (_N. Patroclus_ Fab.) by means of _Pap. Leilus_ Lin. which thus stands between the night and the day-flying Lepidoptera. Many of the insects placed in our division of _Græci caudati_, are allied to _Danaus_ Lat. by the larva of both having retractile hornshaped processes, and the two genera seem still further connected by _Papilio similis_ and _dissimilis_ in one group, and by _P. Priamus_ in the other; while the clear winged species from New Holland seem to indicate an affinity with the _Heliconiæ_.  The laborious and important investigations of M. Savigny into the structure of the mouth of these insects are too well known, to require a more particular notice in this slight sketch of the subject.         *       *       *       *       *  PAPILIO Polymetus.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P.

I have not, at this particular time, the means of referring either to my notes or my collections, by which the recollection I have on the subject might be in some way confirmed; and, until this is done, it is much better retaining the two insects as distinct species: the figures of both will show their very close resemblance, in every thing but the bands on the upper surface of the wings.

To the personal observations of M. Vaillant we owe the first, and indeed the only detailed account, of their real economy, and which this enterprising ornithologist remarked during his travels in Africa, and published in his work on the birds of that continent; a work which will be valued and consulted when most of the systems framed by closet naturalists will be forgotten.  M. Vaillant records a singular fact respecting these birds: which is, that the males only assume their rich and vivid colours during the season of courtship; at other times they are scarcely to be known from the females, whose plumage in general is very plain. Another bird, very nearly resembling this, has been figured by M. Vaillant under the name of _Le Sucrier à Plastron rouge_ (Ois. d'Af. pl. 300.); his reasons, however, for separating them, are, I think, sufficient, at least until more forcible ones are adduced than mere conjecture. Our figure is the size of life; on each side the breast is a tuft of yellow feathers; the back, neck, and head shining golden green, changing in various lights. The female is said to be the _Certhia Capensis_ of Lin., which is greyish brown above, and paler beneath.  The different generic names which have been given to these birds by modern systematic writers, require some elucidation. They were originally placed by Linnæus among the _Certhiæ_; out of this genus Illiger formed another by the name of _Nectarinia_, in which he included not only these birds, but many others allied to them. From this genus of Illiger's, Cuvier separated a part under the generic appellation of _Cinnyris_, a genus which comprised those species of Illiger's _Nectarinia_ only which are found in the parallels of latitude of the old world. So far these changes can be understood; but Professor Temminck, without noticing this previous arrangement, places the birds belonging to Cuvier's genus _Cinnyris_, under his own modification of Illiger's _Nectarinia_, while to the _Nectariniæ_, as characterized by Cuvier, he gives the generic name of _Coereba_. This last change has introduced great confusion; for the student must bear in mind, that Cuvier's genus _Nectarinia_ corresponds to Temminck's _Coereba_; that _Cinnyris_ of Cuvier is _Nectarinia_ of Temminck; and finally, that all these are included under Illiger's original genus _Nectarinia_! M. Vieillot has still further added to this unfortunate multiplicity of names, by giving that of _Mellisuga_ to Cuvier's _Cinnyris_. This may truly be termed a war of words. In the meantime, as Cuvier was the first who, by giving the name of _Cinnyris_, designated the _Sucriers_ of Vaillant, and those _only_, his definition and generic name to these birds should unquestionably supersede all others.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 96  [Illustration]  ANODON rugosus,  _Wrinkled Horse Mussel._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa transversa, plerumque tenuis.

In the Linnæan system, the first, being furnished with teeth, are placed among the _Myæ_; and the latter, from having none, are arranged with the _Mytili_. Two common shells, in our own rivers and ponds (_Mya pictorum_, and _Mytilus anatinus Lin._), will readily present to the student the characters by which they are severally distinguished. The shells of the present genus bear such a general resemblance to each other, and are so simple in their construction, that a corresponding minuteness of discrimination is requisite to characterize the species; I have, therefore, selected for this purpose the modification of the upper margin to which the ligament is attached, and which in other shells forms the bases of the teeth. This I have termed the hinge margin. The form of the notch or sinus which terminates this part will also be found of much importance in discriminating the species; for no shells vary more in their form, thickness, or convexity than these do, according to their locality, age, or other circumstances.  Shell transverse, oval; rather thick and ventricose; both extremities obtuse; the anterior side (from the umbones to the exterior margin) obliquely rounded; umbones prominent; hinge margin rather thick, slightly curved, and swelled immediately under the umbones; sinus short, abrupt, curved; epidermis coarse, black, and much wrinkled; inside stained with yellow, and having a narrow reddish rim or margin.  For this species, now, I believe, first made known, I am indebted to G. C. Bainbridge, Esq. of Liverpool, who received several specimens from the United States. It appears to have been unknown to Mr. Say, who has published an account of the land and river shells of North America.  The student might be led to suppose, that the two genera of _Unio_ and _Anodon_ are strongly characterized; for the first includes many of the most ponderous bivalves yet discovered, and the second some remarkably thin and brittle. Among the _Uniones_ are shells furnished with hinges of the greatest force, while most of the _Anodons_ are perfectly destitute of any; nevertheless, the gradations by which these characters approach each other are very remarkable, and some shells which partake of both have been arranged in separate genera. Of these, the best defined are _Hyria_ Lam. and _Dipsas_ of Leach; the one allied nearest to _Unio_, but having the cardinal teeth assuming the appearance of lateral or lamellar teeth; the other more resembling the Anodons, but furnished with a strongly defined and elevated lamellar tooth, extending the whole length of the hinge.
