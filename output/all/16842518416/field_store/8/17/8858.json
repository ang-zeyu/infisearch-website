The baker called after him that he had not left money enough. \"Never mind that,\" said young sooty, \"you will have _the less to count_.\"           LXIV.--THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES.  LORD KAMES used to relate a story of a man who claimed the honor of his acquaintance on rather singular grounds. His lordship, when one of the justiciary judges, returning from the north circuit to Perth, happened one night to sleep at Dunkeld. The next morning, walking towards the ferry, but apprehending he had missed his way, he asked a man whom he met to conduct him. The other answered with much cordiality: \"That I will do, with all my heart, my lord; does not your lordship remember me? My name's John ----; I have had the honor to be before your lordship for stealing sheep?\"--\"Oh, John, I remember you well; and how is your wife? she had the honor to be before me, too, for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen.\"--\"At your lordship's service. We were very lucky, we got off for want of evidence; and I am still going on in the butcher trade.\"--\"Then,\" replied his lordship, \"we may have the honor of _meeting again_.\"           LXV.--A LATE EDITION.

SCOTLAND! thy weather's like a modish wife,     Thy winds and rains for ever are at strife;     So termagant awhile her thunder tries,     And when she can no longer scold, she cries.           LXVII.--THREE TOUCHSTONES.  AN ancient sage uttered the following apothegm:--\"The goodness of gold is tried by fire, the goodness of women by gold, and the goodness of men by the ordeal of women.\"           LXVIII.--A DIALOGUE.      _Pope._      SINCE my old friend is grown so great,     As to be minister of state,     I'm told (but 'tis not true I hope)     That Craggs will be ashamed of Pope.      _Craggs._      ALAS! if I am such a creature,     To grow the worse for growing greater,     Why, faith, in spite of all my brags,     'Tis Pope must be ashamed of Craggs.           LXIX.--BEAR AND VAN.  THE facetious Mr. Bearcroft told his friend Mr. Vansittart, \"Your name is such a long one, I shall drop the _sittart_, and call you _Van_ for the future.\"--\"With all my heart,\" said he: \"by the same rule, I shall drop _croft_, and call you _Bear_!\"           LXX.--EPITAPH FOR SIR JOHN VANBRUGH.      LIE heavy on him, Earth! for he     Laid many heavy loads on thee!           LXXI.--PROVING THEIR METAL.  WHEN the Prince of Orange, afterwards William the Third, came over to this country, five of the seven bishops who were sent to the Tower declared for his highness; but the other two would not come into the measures. Upon which Dryden said, that \"the seven golden candlesticks them proved _prince's metal_.\"           LXXII.--A DISTANT PROSPECT.  THROUGH an avenue of trees, at the back of Trinity College, a church may be seen at a considerable distance, the approach to which affords no very pleasing scenery. Porson, walking that way with a friend, and observing the church, remarked, \"That it put him in mind of a _fellowship_, which was a long dreary walk, with a church _at the end of it_.\"           LXXIII.--SOUND SLEEPER.  A MAN meeting his friend, said, \"I spoke to you last night in a dream.\"--\"Pardon me,\" replied the other, \"I did not _hear you_.\"           LXXIV.--A CHEAP CURE.  \"PRAY, Mr. Abernethy, what is the cure for gout?\" asked an indolent and luxurious citizen. \"Live upon sixpence a day, and _earn it_!\" was the pithy answer.           LXXV.--EPIGRAM.      YOU say, without reward or fee,       Your uncle cur'd me of a dang'rous ill;     I say he never did prescribe for me,       The proof is plain,--_I'm living still_.           LXXVI.--A GRAMMATICAL DISTINCTION.  SEVERAL young gentlemen once got up a play at Cambridge. On the day of representation one of the performers took it into his head to make an excuse, and his part was obliged to be read. Hobhouse came forward to apologize to the audience, and told them that _a_ Mr. ---- had declined to perform his part. The gentleman was highly indignant at the \"_a_,\" and had a great inclination to pick a quarrel with Scrope Davies, who replied that he supposed Mr. ---- wanted to be called _the_ Mr. So-and-so. He ever afterwards went by the name of the \"_Definite Article_.\"           LXXVII.--A BANKER'S CHECK.  ROGERS, when a certain M.P., in a review of his poems, said \"he wrote very well for a banker,\" wrote, in return, the following:--      \"They say he has no heart, and I deny it:     He has a heart, and--_gets his speeches by it_.\"           LXXVIII.--A FILLIP FOR HIM.  THE present Lord Chancellor remarked of a young barrister who had just made a speech of more poetry than law, \"Poor young man, he has studied the _wrong Phillips_.\"           LXXIX.--BLACK OILS.  \"WHAT'S the matter?\" inquired a passer-by, observing a crowd collected around a black fellow, whom an officer was attempting to secure, to put on board an outward-bound whale ship, from which he had deserted. \"Matter! matter enough,\" exclaimed the delinquent, \"pressing a poor negro _to get oil_.\"           LXXX.--A BAD CROP.

AS a man who, deeply involved in debt, was walking in the street with a very melancholy air, one of his acquaintance asked him why he was so sorrowful. \"Alas!\" said he, \"I am in a state of insolvency.\"--\"Well,\" said his friend, \"if that is the case, it is not you, but your _creditors_, who ought to wear a woful countenance.\"           LXXXIV.--BLACK AND WHITE.  DURING the short time that Lord Byron was in Parliament, a petition, setting forth the wretched condition of the Irish peasantry, was one evening presented, and very coldly received by the \"hereditary legislative wisdom.\"--\"Ah,\" said Lord Byron, \"what a misfortune it was for the Irish that they were not _born black_! They would then have had plenty of friends in both houses.\"           LXXXV.--HOME IS HOME.  \"I LIVE in Julia's eyes,\" said an affected dandy in Colman's hearing. \"I don't wonder at it,\" replied George; \"since I observed she had a _sty_ in them when I saw her last.\"           LXXXVI.--A LIGHT STUDY.  AS a worthy city baronet was gazing one evening at the gas lights in front of the Mansion-house, an old acquaintance came up to him and said, \"Well, Sir William, are you studying astronomy?\"--\"No, sir,\" replied the alderman, \"I am studying _gas-tronomy_.\"           LXXXVII.--A CLIMAX.  A VERY volatile young lord, whose conquests in the female world were numberless, at last married. \"Now, my lord,\" said the countess, \"I hope you'll mend.\"--\"Madam,\" says he, \"you may depend on it this is _my last folly_.\"           LXXXVIII.--SIMPLE DIVISION.  WHEN the Earl of Bradford was brought before the Lord Chancellor, to be examined upon application for a statute of lunacy against him, the chancellor asked him, \"How many legs has a sheep?\"--\"Does your lordship mean,\" answered Lord Bradford, \"a live sheep or a dead sheep?\"--\"Is it not the same thing?\" said the chancellor. \"No, my lord,\" said Lord Bradford, \"there is much difference; a live sheep may have four legs; a dead sheep has only two: the two fore legs are shoulders; but there are but _two legs of mutton_.\"           LXXXIX.--HERO-PHOBIA.  WHEN George II. was once expressing his admiration of General Wolfe, some one observed that the General was mad. \"Oh! he is mad, is he!\" said the king, with great quickness, \"then I wish he would _bite_ some other of my generals.\"           XC.--LYING CONSISTENTLY.  TWO old ladies, who were known to be of the same age, had the same desire to keep the real number concealed; one therefore used upon a New-year's-day to go to the other, and say, \"Madam, I am come to know how _old_ we are to be this year.\"           XCI.--NOT RIGHT.  A PRISONER being called on to plead to an indictment for larceny, was told by the clerk to hold up his right hand.

DR. BURNEY, who wrote the celebrated anagram on Lord Nelson, after his victory of the Nile, \"Honor est a Nilo\" (Horatio Nelson), was shortly after on a visit to his lordship, at his beautiful villa at Merton. From his usual absence of mind, he neglected to put a nightcap into his portmanteau, and consequently borrowed one from his lordship. Before retiring to rest, he sat down to study, as was his common practice, having first put on the cap, and was shortly after alarmed by finding it in flames; he immediately collected the burnt remains, and returned them with the following lines:--      \"Take your nightcap again, my good lord, I desire,       I would not retain it a minute;     What belongs to a Nelson, wherever there's _fire_,       Is sure to be instantly _in it_.\"           XCIII.--\"HE LIES LIKE TRUTH.\"  A PERSON who had resided for some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#4)"],["body"," on the coast of Africa was asked if he thought it possible to civilize the natives. \"As a proof of the possibility of it,\" said he, \"I have known some negroes that thought as little of a _lie_ or an _oath_ as any European.\"           XCIV.--HAND AND GLOVE.

A LAWYER being sick, made his last will, and gave all his estate to fools and madmen: being asked the reason for so doing; \"From such,\" said he, \"I _had_ it, and to such I _give_ it again.\"           XCVII.--CHEESE AND DESSERT.  TWO city ladies meeting at a visit, one a grocer's wife, and the other a cheesemonger's, when they had risen up and took their departure, the cheesemonger's wife was going out of the room first, upon which the grocer's lady, pulling her back by the tail of her gown, and stepping before her, said, \"No, madam, nothing comes after _cheese_.\"           XCVIII.--VERY POINTED.

I know I had some bottles of their _port_, but I did not taste a drop of their _ditto_.\"           C.--COMPUTATION.  AN Irish counsellor having lost his cause, which had been tried before three judges, one of whom was esteemed a very able lawyer, and the other two but indifferent, some of the other barristers were very merry on the occasion. \"Well, now,\" says he, \"I have lost. But who could help it, when there were an hundred judges on the bench?--_one_ and _two ciphers_.\"           CI.--PRIMOGENITURE.  AN Irish clergyman having gone to visit the portraits of the Scottish kings in Holyrood House, observed one of the monarchs of a very youthful appearance, while _his son_ was depicted with a long beard, and wore the traits of extreme old age. \"Sancta Maria,\" exclaimed the good Hibernian, \"is it possible that this gentleman was an _old man_ when his father _was born_!!\"           CII.--CHECK TO THE KING.  ONE day James the Second, in the middle of his courtiers, made use of this assertion: \"I never knew a modest man make his way at court.\" To this observation one of the gentlemen present boldly replied: \"And, please your majesty, _whose fault is that_?\" The king was struck, and remained silent.           CIII.--A FALL IN MITRES.  ONE of the wooden _mitres_, carved by Grinly Gibbons over a prebend's stall in the cathedral church of Canterbury, happening to become loose, Jessy White, the surveyor of that edifice, inquired of the dean whether he should make it fast: \"For, perhaps,\" said Jessy, \"it may fall on your reverence's head.\"--\"Well!

THERE was much sound palpable argument in the speech of a country lad to an idler, who boasted his ancient family: \"So much the worse for you,\" said the peasant; \"as we ploughmen say, '_the older the seed the worse the crop_.'\"           CVI.--PROOF IMPRESSION.  MR. BETHEL, an Irish barrister, when the question of the Union was in debate, like all the junior barristers published pamphlets upon the subject. Mr. Lysaght met this pamphleteer in the hall of the Four Courts, and in a friendly way, said, \"Zounds! Bethel, I wonder you never told me you had published a pamphlet on the Union. The one I saw contained some of the best things I have yet seen in any pamphlet upon the subject.\"--\"I'm very proud you think so,\" said the other, rubbing his hands with satisfaction; \"and pray, what are the things that pleased you so much?\"--\"Why,\" replied Lysaght, \"as I passed by a pastry-cook's shop this morning, I saw a girl come out with three _hot mince-pies_ wrapped up in one of your works.\"           CVII.--NECK OR NOTHING.  A RIGHT reverend prelate, himself a man of extreme good-nature, was frequently much vexed in the spirit by the proud, froward, perverse, and untractable temper of his next vicar. The latter, after an absence much longer than usual, one day paid a visit to the bishop, who kindly inquired the cause of his absence, and was answered by the vicar, that he had been confined to his house for some time past by an obstinate _stiffness_ in his _knee_. \"I am glad of that,\" replied the prelate; \"'tis a good symptom that the disorder has changed place, for I had a long time thought it _immovably settled_ in your NECK.\"           CVIII.--ARCADIA.  A FARM was lately advertised in a newspaper, in which all the beauty of the situation, fertility of the soil, and salubrity of the air were detailed in the richest flow of rural description, which was further enhanced with this,--N.B. There is not _an attorney_ within fifteen miles of the neighborhood.           CIX.--QUITE PERFECTION.  A PAINTER in the Waterloo Road had the following announcement displayed on the front of his house: \"The Acme of Stencil!\" A \"learned Theban\" in the same line in an adjoining street, in order to outdo the \"old original\" stenciller, thus set forth his pretensions: \"Stencilling in all its branches performed in the very height _of acme_!\"           CX.--THE LATE MR. COLLINS.  COLLINS the poet, coming into a town the day after a young lady, of whom he was fond, had left it, said, how unlucky he was that he had come _a day after the fair_.           CXI.--A FAMILY PARTY.  A CERTAIN lodging-house was very much infested by vermin. A gentleman who slept there one night, told the landlady so in the morning, when she said, \"La, sir, we haven't a _single_ bug in the house.\"--\"No ma'am,\" said he, \"they're all _married_, and have large families too.\"           CXII.--CALF'S HEAD SURPRISED.  A STUPID person one day seeing a man of learning enjoying the pleasures of the table, said, \"So, sir, philosophers, I see, can indulge in the greatest delicacies.\"--\"Why not,\" replied the other, \"do you think Providence intended all the _good things_ for fools?\"           CXIII.--POPPING THE QUESTION.  A GIRL forced by her parents into a disagreeable match with an old man, whom she detested, when the clergyman came to that part of the service where the bride is asked if she consents to take the bridegroom for her husband, said, with great simplicity, \"Oh dear, no, sir; but you are the first person who has asked _my opinion_ about the matter.\"           CXIV.--SCANDALOUS.  IT was said of a great calumniator, and a frequenter of other person's tables, that he never _opened his mouth_ but at another man's expense.

WHEN Jefferies was told that the Prince of Orange would very soon land, and that a manifesto, stating his inducements, objects, &c., was already written, \"Pray, my Lord Chief Justice,\" said a gentleman present, \"what do you think will be the heads of this manifesto?\"--\"_Mine_ will be one,\" replied he.           CXVI.--MODEST REQUEST.  A GENTLEMAN travelling, was accosted by a man walking along the road, who begged the favor of him to put his great coat, which he found very heavy, into his carriage. \"With all my heart,\" said the gentleman; \"but if we should not be travelling to the same place, how will you get your coat?\"--\"Monsieur,\" answered the man with great _naïveté_, \"_I shall be in it_.\"           CXVII.--CAP THIS.  SIR THOMAS MORE, the famous Chancellor, who preserved his humor and wit to the last moment, when he came to be executed on Tower-hill, the headsman demanded his upper garment as his fee; \"Ah! friend,\" said he, taking off his cap, \"that, I think, is my _upper_ garment.\"           CXVIII.--A PRETTY METAPHOR.  A YOUNG lady marrying a man she loved, and leaving many friends in town, to retire with him into the country, Mrs. D. said prettily, \"She has turned one-and-twenty shillings into a guinea.\"           CXIX.--ON A STONE THROWN AT A VERY GREAT MAN, BUT WHICH MISSED HIM.      TALK no more of the lucky escape of the _head_       From a flint so unluckily thrown;     I think very diff'rent, with thousands indeed,       'Twas a lucky escape for the _stone_.           CXX.--A MAN OF LETTERS.  WHEN Mr. Wilkes was in the meridian of his popularity, a man in a porter-house, classing himself as an eminent literary character, was asked by one of his companions what right he had to assume such a title. \"Sir,\" says he, \"I'd have you know, I had the honor of _chalking_ number 45 upon every door between Temple Bar and Hyde Park-corner.\"           CXXI.--WELSH WIG-GING.  AN Englishman and a Welshman, disputing in whose country was the best living, said the Welshman, \"There is such noble housekeeping in Wales, that I have known above a dozen cooks employed at one wedding dinner.\"--\"Ay,\" answered the Englishman, \"that was because every man _toasted_ his own cheese.\"           CXXII.--A SPRIG OF SHILLALAH.
