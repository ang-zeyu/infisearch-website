My father is deceas'd.  Come, Gaveston,    And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend._    Ah, words that make me surfeit with delight!    What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston    Than live and be the favourite of a king!    Sweet prince, I come! these, thy amorous lines    Might have enforc'd me to have swum from France,    And, like Leander, gasp'd upon the sand,    So thou wouldst smile, and take me in thine arms.    The sight of London to my exil'd eyes    Is as Elysium to a new-come soul:    Not that I love the city or the men,    But that it harbours him I hold so dear,--    The king, upon whose bosom let me lie,    And with the world be still at enmity.    What need the arctic people love star-light,    To whom the sun shines both by day and night?    Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!    My knee shall bow to none but to the king.    As for the multitude, that are but sparks,    Rak'd up in embers of their poverty,--    _Tanti,_--I'll fawn first on the wind,    That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.                  _Enter three_ Poor Men.     But how now! what are these? _Poor Men._ Such as desire your worship's service. _Gav._ What canst thou do? _First P. Man._ I can ride. _Gav._ But I have no horse.--What art thou? _Sec. P. Man._ A traveller. _Gav._ Let me see; thou wouldst do well    To wait at my trencher, and tell me lies at dinner-time;    And, as I like your discoursing, I'll have you.--    And what art thou? _Third P. Man._ A soldier, that hath serv'd against the Scot. _Gav._ Why, there are hospitals for such as you:    I have no war; and therefore, sir, be gone. _Third P. Man._ Farewell, and perish by a soldier's hand,    That wouldst reward them with an hospital! _Gav._ Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much    As if a goose should play the porcupine,    And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.    But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;    I'll flatter these, and make them live in hope.--            [_Aside._    You know that I came lately out of France,    And yet I have not view'd my lord the king:    If I speed well, I'll entertain you all. _All._ We thank your worship. _Gav._ I have some business: leave me to myself. _All._ We will wait here about the court. _Gav._ Do.                                            [_Exeunt Poor Men._             These are not men for me;    I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,    Musicians, that with touching of a string    May draw the pliant king which way I please:    Music and poetry is his delight;    Therefore I'll have Italian masks by night,    Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;    And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,    Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;    My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,    Shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay;    Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,    With hair that gilds the water as it glides    Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,    And in his sportful hands an olive-tree,    To hide those parts which men delight to see,    Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,    One like Actæon, peeping through the grove,    Shall by the angry goddess be transform'd,    And running in the likeness of an hart,    By yelping hounds pull'd down, shall semm to die:    Such things as these best please his majesty.--    Here comes my lord the king, and the nobles,    From the parliament.  I'll stand aside.                    [_Retires._  _Enter_ KING EDWARD, KENT, LANCASTER, _the elder_ MORTIMER,       _the younger_ MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and_       Attendants.  _K. Edw._ Lancaster! _Lan._ My lord? _Gav._ That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor.                       [_Aside._ _K. Edw._ Will you not grant me this?--In spite of them    I'll have my will; and these two Mortimers,    That cross me thus, shall know I am displeased.              [_Aside._ _E. Mor._ If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston. _Gav._ That villain Mortimer! I'll be his death.                [_Aside._ __Y. Mor._ Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself,    Were sworn to your father at his death,    That he should ne'er return into the realm:    And now, my lord, ere I will break my oath,    This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,    Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,    And underneath thy banners march who will,    For Mortimer will hang his armour up. _Gav. Mort dieu!_                                               [_Aside._ _K. Edw._ Well, Mortimer, I'll make thee rue these words:    Beseems it thee to contradict thy king?    Frown'st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?    The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,    And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.    I will have Gaveston; and you shall know    What danger 'tis to stand against your king. _Gav._ Well done, Ned!                                          [_Aside._ _Lan._ My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,    That naturally would love and honour you,    But for that base and obscure Gaveston?    Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,--    Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester;    These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay,    Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm:    Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight. _Kent._ Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;    But know I'll speak, and to the proof, I hope.    I do remember, in my father's days,    Lord Percy of the North, being highly mov'd,    Brav'd Mowbray in presence of the king;    For which, had not his highness lov'd him well,    He should have lost his head; but with his look    Th' undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas'd,    And Mowbray and he were reconcil'd:    Yet dare you brave the king unto his face.--    Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads    Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues. _War._ O, our heads! _K. Edw._ Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant. _War._ Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer. _Y. Mor._ I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.--    Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,    And strike off his that makes you threaten us.--    Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,    And henceforth parley with our naked swords. _E. Mor._ Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads. _War._ All Warwickshire will leave him for my sake. _Lan._ And northward Lancaster hath many friends.--    Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,    Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,    To float in blood, and at thy wanton head    The glozing head of thy base minion thrown.        [_Exeunt all except King Edward, Kent, Gaveston,           and attendants._ _K. Edw._ I cannot brook these haughty menaces:    Am I a king, and must be over-rul'd!--    Brother, display my ensigns in the field:    I'll bandy with the barons and the earls,    And either die or live with Gaveston. _Gav._ I can no longer keep me from my lord.            [_Comes forward._ _K. Edw._ What, Gaveston! welcome!  Kiss not my hand:    Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.    Why shouldst thou kneel? know'st thou not who I am?    Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston:    Not Hylas was more mourned for of Hercules    Than thou hast been of me since thy exile. _Gav._ And, since I went from hence, no soul in hell    Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston. _K. Edw._ I know it.--Brother, welcome home my friend.--    Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,    And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:    I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;    And sooner shall the sea o'erwhelm my land    Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.    I here create thee Lord High-chamberlain,    Chief Secretary to the state and me,    Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man. _Gav._ My lord, these titles far exceed my worth. _Kent._ Brother, the least of these may well suffice    For one of greater birth than Gaveston. _K. Edw._ Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words.--    Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts:    Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.    If for these dignities thou be envied,    I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee,    Is Edward pleas'd with kingly regiment.    Fear'st thou thy person? thou shalt have a guard:    Wantest thou gold? go to my treasury:    Wouldst thou be lov'd and fear'd? receive my seal,    Save or condemn, and in our name command    What so thy mind affects, or fancy likes. _Gav._ It shall suffice me to enjoy your love;    Which whiles I have, I think myself as great    As Cæsar riding in the Roman street,    With captive kings at his triumphant car.                _Enter the_ BISHOP OF COVENTRY.  _K. Edw._ Whither goes my Lord of Coventry so fast? _Bish. of Cov._ To celebrate your father's exequies.    But is that wicked Gaveston return'd? _K. Edw._ Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng'd on thee,    That wert the only cause of his exile. _Gav._ 'Tis true; and, but for reverence of these robes,    Thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place. _Bish. of Cov._ I did no more than I was bound to do:    And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim'd,    As then I did incense the parliament,    So will I now, and thou shalt back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20288"],["title","Edward the Second (#1)"],["body"," France. _Gav._ Saving your reverence, you must pardon me. _K. Edw._ Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,    And in the channel christen him anew. _Kent._ Ay, brother, lay not violent hands on him!    For he'll complain unto the see of Rome. _Gav._ Let him complain unto the see of hell:    I'll be reveng'd on him for my exile. _K. Edw._ No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods:    Be thou lord bishop, and receive his rents,    And make him serve thee as thy chaplain:    I give him thee; here, use him as thou wilt. _Gav._ He shall to prison, and there die in bolts. _K. Edw._ Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt. _Bish. of Cov._ For this offence be thou accurs'd of God! _K. Edw._ Who's there?  Convey this priest to the Tower. _Bish. of Cov._ True, true. _K. Edw._ But, in the meantime, Gaveston, away,    And take possession of his house and goods.    Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard    To see it done, and bring thee safe again. _Gav._ What should a priest do with so fair a house?    A prison may beseem his holiness.                           [_Exeunt._   _Enter, on one side, the elder_ MORTIMER, _and the younger_    MORTIMER; _on the other,_ WARWICK, _and_ LANCASTER.  _War._ 'Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,    And goods and body given to Gaveston. _Lan._ What, will they tyrannise upon the church?    Ah, wicked King! accursed Gaveston!    This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,    Shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine. _Y. Mor._ Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;    Unless his breast be sword-proof, he shall die. _E. Mor._ How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster? _Y. Mor._ Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent? _Lan._ That villain Gaveston is made an earl. _E. Mor._ An earl! _War._ Ay, and besides Lord-chamberlain of the realm,    And Secretary too, and Lord of Man. _E. Mor._ We may not nor we will not suffer this. _Y. Mor._ Why post we not from hence to levy men? _Lan._ \"My Lord of Cornwall\" now at every word;    And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,    For vailing of his bonnet, one good look.    Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march:    Nay, more, the guard upon his lordship waits,    And all the court begins to flatter him. _War._ Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,    He nods, and scorns, and smiles at those that pass. _E. Mor._ Doth no man take exceptions at the slave? _Lan._ All stomach him, but none dare speak a word. _Y. Mor._ Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!    Were all the earls and barons of my mind,    We'd hale him from the bosom of the king,    And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,    Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,    Will be the ruin of the realm and us. _War._ Here comes my Lord of Canterbury's grace. _Lan._ His countenance bewrays he is displeas'd.       _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, _and an_                      Attendant.  _Archb. of Cant._ First, were his sacred garments rent and torn;    Then laid they violent hands upon him; next,    Himself imprison'd, and his goods asseiz'd:    This certify the Pope: away, take horse.            [_Exit Attendant._ _Lan._ My lord, will you take arms against the king? _Archb. of Cant._ What need I?  God himself is up in arms    When violence is offer'd to the church. _Y. Mor._ Then will you join with us, that be his peers,    To banish or behead that Gaveston? _Archb. of Cant._ What else, my lords? for it concerns me near;    The bishoprick of Coventry is his.                     _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.  _Y. Mor._ Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast? _Q. Isab._ Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,    To live in grief and baleful discontent;    For now my lord the king regards me not,    But dotes upon the love of Gaveston:    He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,    Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;    And, when I come, he frowns, as who should say,    \"Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston.\" _E. Mor._ Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch'd? _Y. Mor._ Madam, return unto the court again:    That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile,    Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,    The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,    And courage too, to be reveng'd at full. _Archb. of Cant._ But yet lift not your swords against the king. _Lan._ No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence. _War._ And war must be the means, or he'll stay still. _Q. Isab._ Then let him stay; for, rather than my lord    Shall be oppress'd with civil mutinies,    I will endure a melancholy life,    And let him frolic with his minion. _Archb. of Cant._ My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:    We and the rest, that are his counsellors,    Will meet, and with a general consent    Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals. _Lan._ What we confirm the king will frustrate. _Y. Mor._ Then may we lawfully revolt from him. _War._ But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be? _Archb. of Cant._ At the New Temple. _Y. Mor._ Content. _Archb. of Cant._ And, in the meantime, I'll entreat you all    To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me. _Lan._ Come, then, let's away. _Y. Mor._ Madam, farewell. _Q. Isab._ Farewell, sweet Mortimer, and, for my sake,    Forbear to levy arms against the king. _Y. Mor._ Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must.             [_Exeunt._                 _Enter_ GAVESTON _and_ KENT.  _Gav._ Edmund, the mighty prince of Lancaster,    That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,    And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,    With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight,    Are gone towards Lambeth: there let them remain.                 [_Exeunt._  _Enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _the elder_     MORTIMER, _the younger_ MORTIMER, _the_ ARCHBISHOP     OF CANTERBURY, _and_ Attendants.  _Lan._ Here is the form of Gaveston's exile;    May it please your lordship to subscribe your name. _Archb. of Cant._ Give me the paper.                             [_He subscribes, as the others do after him._ _Lan._ Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name. _War._ But I long more to see him banish'd hence. _Y. Mor._ The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,    Unless he be declin'd from that base peasant.      _Enter_ KING EDWARD, GAVESTON, _and_ KENT.  _K. Edw._ What, are you mov'd that Gaveston sits here?    It is our pleasure; we will have it so. _Lan._ Your grace doth well to place him by your side,    For nowhere else the new earl is so safe. _E. Mor._ What man of noble birth can brook this sight?    _Quam male conveniunt!--_    See, what a scornful look the peasant casts! _Pem._ Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants? _War._ Ignoble vassal, that, like Phaeton,    Aspir'st unto the guidance of the sun! _Y. Mor._ Their downfall is at hand, their forces down:    We will not thus be fac'd and over-peer'd. _K. Edw._ Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer! _E. Mor._ Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston! _Kent._ Is this the duty that you owe your king? _War._ We know our duties; let him know his peers. _K. Edw._ Whither will you bear him? stay, or ye shall die. _E. Mor._ We are no traitors; therefore threaten not. _Gav._ No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home.    Were I a king-- _Y. Mor._ Thou, villain! wherefore talk'st thou of a king,    That hardly art a gentleman by birth? _K. Edw._ Were he a peasant, being my minion,    I'll make the proudest of you stoop to him. _Lan._ My lord--you may not thus disparage us.--    Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston! _E. Mor._ And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.                                    [_Attendants remove Gaveston and Kent._ _K. Edw._ Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king:    Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward's throne;    Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.    Was ever king thus over-rul'd as I? _Lan._ Learn, then, to rule us better, and the realm. _Y. Mor._ What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain. _War._ Think you that we can brook this upstart['s] pride? _K. Edw._ Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech. _Archb. of Cant._ Why are you not mov'd? be patient, my lord,    And see what we your counsellors have done. _Y. Mor._ My lords, now let us all be resolute,    And either have our wills, or lose our lives. _K. Edw._ Meet you for this, proud over-daring peers!    Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me,    This isle shall fleet upon the ocean,    And wander to the unfrequented Inde. _Archb. of Cant._ You know that I am legate to the Pope:    On your allegiance to the see of Rome,    Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile. _Y. Mor._ Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we    Depose him, and elect another king. _K. Edw._ Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield:    Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can. _Lan._ Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight. _Archb. of Cant._ Remember how the bishop was abus'd:    Either banish him that was the cause thereof,    Or I will presently discharge these lords    Of duty and allegiance due to thee. _K. Edw._ It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair:    The legate of the Pope will be obey'd.--                     [_Aside._    My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;    Thou, Lancaster, High-Admiral of our fleet;    Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;    And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North;    And thou of Wales.  If this content you not,    Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,    And share it equally amongst you all,    So I may have some nook or corner left,    To frolic with my dearest Gaveston. _Archb. of Cant._ Nothing shall alter us; we are resolv'd. _Lan._ Come, come, subscribe. _Y. Mor._ Why should you love him whom the world hates so? _K. Edw._ Because he loves me more than all the world.    Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men    Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston!    You that be noble-born should pity him. _War._ You that are princely-born should shake him off:    For shame, subscribe, and let the clown depart. _E. Mor._ Urge him, my"]]]
