Rulers of both halves of the country are represented, and Monsieur Gautier has shown,(4) from data on the reverse of the inscription, that the kings of the Delta were arranged on the original stone before the rulers of the south who are outlined upon our new fragment. Moreover, we have now recovered definite proof that this band of the inscription is concerned with predynastic Egyptian princes; for the cartouche of the king, whose years are enumerated in the second band immediately below the kings of the south, reads Athet, a name we may with certainty identify with Athothes, the second successor of Menes, founder of the Ist Dynasty, which is already given under the form Ateth in the Abydos List of Kings.(5) It is thus quite certain that the first band of the inscription relates to the earlier periods before the two halves of the country were brought together under a single ruler.       (1) Cairo No. 1; see Gautier, _Mus. Égypt._, III, pl. xxiv      f.       (2) In this upper band the spaces are true rectangles, being      separated by vertical lines, not by the hieroglyph for      \"year\" as in the lower bands; and each rectangle is assigned      to a separate king, and not, as in the other bands, to a      year of a king's reign.       (3) The difference in the crown worn by this figure is      probably only apparent and not intentional; M. Foucart,      after a careful examination of the fragment, concludes that      it is due to subsequent damage or to an original defect in      the stone; cf. _Bulletin_, XII, ii, p. 162.       (4) Op. cit., p. 32 f.       (5) In Manetho's list he corresponds to {Kenkenos}, the      second successor of Menes according to both Africanus and      Eusebius, who assign the name Athothis to the second ruler      of the dynasty only, the Teta of the Abydos List. The form      Athothes is preserved by Eratosthenes for both of Menes'      immediate successors.  Though the tradition of these remote times is here recorded on a monument of the Vth Dynasty, there is no reason to doubt its general accuracy, or to suppose that we are dealing with purely mythological personages. It is perhaps possible, as Monsieur Foucart suggests, that missing portions of the text may have carried the record back through purely mythical periods to Ptah and the Creation. In that case we should have, as we shall see, a striking parallel to early Sumerian tradition. But in the first extant portions of the Palermo text we are already in the realm of genuine tradition. The names preserved appear to be those of individuals, not of mythological creations, and we may assume that their owners really existed. For though the invention of writing had not at that time been achieved, its place was probably taken by oral tradition. We know that with certain tribes of Africa at the present day, who possess no knowledge of writing, there are functionaries charged with the duty of preserving tribal traditions, who transmit orally to their successors a remembrance of past chiefs and some details of events that occurred centuries before.(1) The predynastic Egyptians may well have adopted similar means for preserving a remembrance of their past history.       (1) M. Foucart illustrates this point by citing the case of      the Bushongos, who have in this way preserved a list of no      less than a hundred and twenty-one of their past kings; op.      cit., p. 182, and cf. Tordey and Joyce, \"Les Bushongos\", in      _Annales du Musée du Congo Belge_, sér. III, t. II, fasc. i      (Brussels, 1911).  Moreover, the new text furnishes fresh proof of the general accuracy of Manetho, even when dealing with traditions of this prehistoric age. On the stele there is no definite indication that these two sets of predynastic kings were contemporaneous rulers of Lower and Upper Egypt respectively; and since elsewhere the lists assign a single sovereign to each epoch, it has been suggested that we should regard them as successive representatives of the legitimate kingdom.(1) Now Manetho, after his dynasties of gods and demi-gods, states that thirty Memphite kings reigned for 1,790 years, and were followed by ten Thinite kings whose reigns covered a period of 350 years. Neglecting the figures as obviously erroneous, we may well admit that the Greek historian here alludes to our two pre-Menite dynasties. But the fact that he should regard them as ruling consecutively does not preclude the other alternative. The modern convention of arranging lines of contemporaneous rulers in parallel columns had not been evolved in antiquity, and without some such method of distinction contemporaneous rulers, when enumerated in a list, can only be registered consecutively. It would be natural to assume that, before the unification of Egypt by the founder of the Ist Dynasty, the rulers of North and South were independent princes, possessing no traditions of a united throne on which any claim to hegemony could be based. On the assumption that this was so, their arrangement in a consecutive series would not have deceived their immediate successors. But it would undoubtedly tend in course of time to obliterate the tradition of their true order, which even at the period of the Vth Dynasty may have been completely forgotten. Manetho would thus have introduced no strange or novel confusion; and this explanation would of course apply to other sections of his system where the dynasties he enumerates appear to be too many for their period. But his reproduction of two lines of predynastic rulers, supported as it now is by the early evidence of the Palermo text, only serves to increase our confidence in the general accuracy of his sources, while at the same time it illustrates very effectively the way in which possible inaccuracies, deduced from independent data, may have arisen in quite early times.       (1) Foucart, loc. cit.  In contrast to the dynasties of Manetho, those of Berossus are so imperfectly preserved that they have never formed the basis of Babylonian chronology.(1) But here too, in the chronological scheme, a similar process of reduction has taken place. Certain dynasties, recovered from native sources and at one time regarded as consecutive, were proved to have been contemporaneous; and archaeological evidence suggested that some of the great gaps, so freely assumed in the royal sequence, had no right to be there. As a result, the succession of known rulers was thrown into truer perspective, and such gaps as remained were being partially filled by later discoveries. Among the latter the most important find was that of an early list of kings, recently published by Père Scheil(2) and subsequently purchased by the British Museum shortly before the war. This had helped us to fill in the gap between the famous Sargon of Akkad and the later dynasties, but it did not carry us far beyond Sargon's own time. Our archaeological evidence also comes suddenly to an end. Thus the earliest picture we have hitherto obtained of the Sumerians has been that of a race employing an advanced system of writing and possessed of a knowledge of metal. We have found, in short, abundant remains of a bronze-age culture, but no traces of preceding ages of development such as meet us on early Egyptian sites. It was a natural inference that the advent of the Sumerians in the Euphrates Valley was sudden, and that they had brought their highly developed culture with them from some region of Central or Southern Asia.       (1) While the evidence of Herodotus is extraordinarily      valuable for the details he gives of the civilizations of      both Egypt and Babylonia, and is especially full in the case      of the former, it is of little practical use for the      chronology. In Egypt his report of the early history is      confused, and he hardly attempts one for Babylonia. It is      probable that on such subjects he sometimes misunderstood      his informants, the priests, whose traditions were more      accurately reproduced by the later native writers Manetho      and Berossus. For a detailed comparison of classical      authorities in relation to both countries, see Griffith in      Hogarth's _Authority and Archaeology_, pp. 161 ff.       (2) See _Comptes rendus_, 1911 (Oct.), pp. 606 ff., and      _Rev. d'Assyr._, IX (1912), p. 69.  The newly published Nippur documents will cause us to modify that view. The lists of early kings were themselves drawn up under the Dynasty of Nîsin in the twenty-second century B.C., and they give us traces of possibly ten and at least eight other \"kingdoms\" before the earliest dynasty of the known lists.(1) One of their novel features is that they include summaries at the end, in which it is stated how often a city or district enjoyed the privilege of being the seat of supreme authority in Babylonia. The earliest of their sections lie within the legendary period, and though in the third dynasty preserved we begin to note signs of a firmer historical tradition, the great break that then occurs in the text is at present only bridged by titles of various \"kingdoms\" which the summaries give; a few even of these are missing and the relative order of the rest is not assured. But in spite of their imperfect state of preservation, these documents are of great historical value and will furnish a framework for future chronological schemes. Meanwhile we may attribute to some of the later dynasties titles in complete agreement with Sumerian tradition. The dynasty of Ur-Engur, for example, which preceded that of Nîsin, becomes, if we like, the Third Dynasty of Ur. Another important fact which strikes us after a scrutiny of the early royal names recovered is that, while two or three are Semitic,(2) the great majority of those borne by the earliest rulers of Kish, Erech, and Ur are as obviously Sumerian.       (1) See Poebel, _Historical Texts_, pp. 73 ff. and      _Historical and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],["title","Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#8)"],["body","Texts_, pl. ii-iv, Nos. 2-5. The      best preserved of the lists is No. 2; Nos. 3 and 4 are      comparatively small fragments; and of No. 5 the obverse only      is here published for the first time, the contents of the      reverse having been made known some years ago by Hilprecht      (cf. _Mathematical, Metrological, and Chronological      Tablets_, p. 46 f., pl. 30, No. 47). The fragments belong to      separate copies of the Sumerian dynastic record, and it      happens that the extant portions of their text in some      places cover the same period and are duplicates of one      another.       (2) Cf., e.g., two of the earliest kings of Kish, Galumum      and Zugagib. The former is probably the Semitic-Babylonian      word _kalumum_, \"young animal, lamb,\" the latter      _zukakîbum_, \"scorpion\"; cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 111.      The occurrence of these names points to Semitic infiltration      into Northern Babylonia since the dawn of history, a state      of things we should naturally expect. It is improbable that      on this point Sumerian tradition should have merely      reflected the conditions of a later period.  It is clear that in native tradition, current among the Sumerians themselves before the close of the third millennium, their race was regarded as in possession of Babylonia since the dawn of history. This at any rate proves that their advent was not sudden nor comparatively recent, and it further suggests that Babylonia itself was the cradle of their civilization. It will be the province of future archaeological research to fill out the missing dynasties and to determine at what points in the list their strictly historical basis disappears. Some, which are fortunately preserved near the beginning, bear on their face their legendary character. But for our purpose they are none the worse for that.  In the first two dynasties, which had their seats at the cities of Kish and Erech, we see gods mingling with men upon the earth. Tammuz, the god of vegetation, for whose annual death Ezekiel saw women weeping beside the Temple at Jerusalem, is here an earthly monarch. He appears to be described as \"a hunter\", a phrase which recalls the death of Adonis in Greek mythology. According to our Sumerian text he reigned in Erech for a hundred years.  Another attractive Babylonian legend is that of Etana, the prototype of Icarus and hero of the earliest dream of human flight.(1) Clinging to the pinions of his friend the Eagle he beheld the world and its encircling stream recede beneath him; and he flew through the gate of heaven, only to fall headlong back to earth. He is here duly entered in the list, where we read that \"Etana, the shepherd who ascended to heaven, who subdued all lands\", ruled in the city of Kish for 635 years.       (1) The Egyptian conception of the deceased Pharaoh      ascending to heaven as a falcon and becoming merged into the      sun, which first occurs in the Pyramid texts (see Gardiner      in Cumont's _Études Syriennes_, pp. 109 ff.), belongs to a      different range of ideas. But it may well have been combined      with the Etana tradition to produce the funerary eagle      employed so commonly in Roman Syria in representations of      the emperor's apotheosis (cf. Cumont, op. cit., pp. 37 ff.,      115).  The god Lugal-banda is another hero of legend. When the hearts of the other gods failed them, he alone recovered the Tablets of Fate, stolen by the bird-god Zû from Enlil's palace. He is here recorded to have reigned in Erech for 1,200 years.  Tradition already told us that Erech was the native city of Gilgamesh, the hero of the national epic, to whom his ancestor Ut-napishtim related the story of the Flood. Gilgamesh too is in our list, as king of Erech for 126 years.  We have here in fact recovered traditions of Post-diluvian kings. Unfortunately our list goes no farther back than that, but it is probable that in its original form it presented a general correspondence to the system preserved from Berossus, which enumerates ten Antediluvian kings, the last of them Xisuthros, the hero of the Deluge. Indeed, for the dynastic period, the agreement of these old Sumerian lists with the chronological system of Berossus is striking. The latter, according to Syncellus, gives 34,090 or 34,080 years as the total duration of the historical period, apart from his preceding mythical ages, while the figure as preserved by Eusebius is 33,091 years.(1) The compiler of one of our new lists,(2) writing some 1,900 years earlier, reckons that the dynastic period in his day had lasted for 32,243 years. Of course all these figures are mythical, and even at the time of the Sumerian Dynasty of Nîsin variant traditions were current with regard to the number of historical and semi-mythical kings of Babylonia and the duration of their rule. For the earlier writer of another of our lists,(3) separated from the one already quoted by an interval of only sixty-seven years, gives 28,876(4) years as the total duration of the dynasties at his time. But in spite of these discrepancies, the general resemblance presented by the huge totals in the variant copies of the list to the alternative figures of Berossus, if we ignore his mythical period, is remarkable. They indicate a far closer correspondence of the Greek tradition with that of the early Sumerians themselves than was formerly suspected.       (1) The figure 34,090 is that given by Syncellus (ed.      Dindorf, p. 147); but it is 34,080 in the equivalent which      is added in \"sars\", &c. The discrepancy is explained by some      as due to an intentional omission of the units in the second      reckoning; others would regard 34,080 as the correct figure      (cf. _Hist. of Bab._, p. 114 f.). The reading of ninety      against eighty is supported by the 33,091 of Eusebius      (_Chron. lib. pri._, ed. Schoene, col. 25).       (2) No. 4.       (3) No. 2.       (4) The figures are broken, but the reading given may be      accepted with some confidence; see Poebel, _Hist. Inscr._,      p. 103.  Further proof of this correspondence may be seen in the fact that the new Sumerian Version of the Deluge Story, which I propose to discuss in the second lecture, gives us a connected account of the world's history down to that point. The Deluge hero is there a Sumerian king named Ziusudu, ruling in one of the newly created cities of Babylonia and ministering at the shrine of his city-god. He is continually given the royal title, and the foundation of the Babylonian \"kingdom\" is treated as an essential part of Creation. We may therefore assume that an Antediluvian period existed in Sumerian tradition as in Berossus.(1) And I think Dr. Poebel is right in assuming that the Nippur copies of the Dynastic List begin with the Post-diluvian period.(2)       (1) Of course it does not necessarily follow that the figure      assigned to the duration of the Antediluvian or mythical      period by the Sumerians would show so close a resemblance to      that of Berossus as we have already noted in their estimates      of the dynastic or historical period. But there is no need      to assume that Berossus' huge total of a hundred and twenty      \"sars\" (432,000 years) is entirely a product of Neo-      Babylonian speculation; the total 432,000 is explained as      representing ten months of a cosmic year, each month      consisting of twelve \"sars\", i.e. 12 x 3600 = 43,200 years.      The Sumerians themselves had no difficulty in picturing two      of their dynastic rulers as each reigning for two \"ners\"      (1,200 years), and it would not be unlikely that \"sars\" were      distributed among still earlier rulers; the numbers were      easily written. For the unequal distribution of his hundred      and twenty \"sars\" by Berossus among his ten Antediluvian      kings, see Appendix II.       (2) The exclusion of the Antediluvian period from the list      may perhaps be explained on the assumption that its compiler      confined his record to \"kingdoms\", and that the mythical      rulers who preceded them did not form a \"kingdom\" within his      definition of the term. In any case we have a clear      indication that an earlier period was included before the      true \"kingdoms\", or dynasties, in an Assyrian copy of the      list, a fragment of which is preserved in the British Museum      from the Library of Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh; see _Chron.      conc. Early Bab. Kings_ (Studies in East. Hist., II f.),      Vol. I, pp. 182 ff., Vol. II, pp. 48 ff., 143 f. There we      find traces of an extra column of text preceding that in      which the first Kingdom of Kish was recorded. It would seem      almost certain that this extra column was devoted to      Antediluvian kings. The only alternative explanation would      be that it was inscribed with the summaries which conclude      the Sumerian copies of our list. But later scribes do not so      transpose their material, and the proper place for summaries      is at the close, not at the beginning, of a list. In the      Assyrian copy the Dynastic List is brought up to date, and      extends down to the later Assyrian period. Formerly its      compiler could only be credited with incorporating      traditions of earlier times. But the correspondence of the      small fragment preserved of its Second Column with part of      the First Column of the Nippur texts (including the name of      \"Enmennunna\") proves that the Assyrian scribe reproduced an      actual copy of the Sumerian document.  Though Professor Barton, on the other hand, holds that the Dynastic List had no concern with the Deluge, his suggestion that the early names preserved by it may have been the original source of Berossus' Antediluvian rulers(1) may yet be accepted in a modified form. In coming to his conclusion he may have been influenced by what seems to me an undoubted correspondence between one of the rulers in our list and the sixth"]]]
