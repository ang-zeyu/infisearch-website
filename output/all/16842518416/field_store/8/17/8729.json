Will they sign?\"  The others nodded and chattered away in their own tongue.  \"When will they be here?\" he then asked.  More chattering followed, and then the four hastened to the shelter which was being constructed. Jimmie gathered from the two questions he had heard that the island had been chosen as a meeting place, and that the shelter was being built for the accommodation of those expected.  He had heard something of the purpose of the government in sending Ned to the Philippines, and remembered now that there had been talk of a possible organization of the native tribes against the United States government. Now he suspected that the chiefs were to meet there to execute the treaty which was to tie the tribes together and bring about an armed revolt against American occupancy.  \"It looks to me,\" he thought, \"like the Chinese were at the bottom of the trouble. I guess China would like to get a foothold here!\"  There was nothing more to be learned from the position he occupied, and so he moved on, always keeping to the right of the campfire, blazing dimly in the rain and requiring constant care, until he came out in a thicket close to the rear of the shelter where the men he believed to be prisoners lay. In five minutes he was at the canvas wall of the refuge, listening.  All was still inside, and it was evident that the conspirators did not suspect that they had been followed to their retreat. Looking about, he saw that most of the men of the party were still busily engaged in constructing the shelter and that no one was near the place he wished to investigate, so he cautiously lifted a corner of the canvas and looked inside.  The men there were four in number, and all seemed to be bound hand and foot! The captors were not taking any chances on escape, although they evidently believed themselves to be in full possession of the little island. All was still inside the shelter except that the rain descended steadily on the leaf roof and now and then a low moan came from the front of the place.  \"That must be the man they cut up,\" thought the boy. \"I wonder if it is Lieutenant Rowe who is wounded?\"  While the boy waited, uncertain what course to pursue, another signal came from the shore and was answered by another pistol shot.  \"Another bunch of Chinks!\" he thought.  The signals brought considerable excitement to the camp, and Jimmie concluded that the new arrival must be a person of some importance. In a short time nearly every person in the camp rushed away down the hill toward the bay where the first launch was anchored, as if to welcome the new arrivals.  \"Now's my time!\" thought the boy, and in an instant his inquisitive head was thrust under the canvas, and then the low, snarling call of a wolf penetrated the shadowy place where the men he believed to be prisoners lay.  The effect of the signal was instantaneous. A figure half arose and dropped back again, only to roll over and over in the direction from which had come the Boy Scout signal used by all members of the Wolf Patrol. As the bound figure came awkwardly rolling on, Jimmie saw, with what joy may be readily understood, a red head shining in the firelight! Never in all his life had any color looked so good to Jimmie as that brilliant red did at that time!  \"Pat Mack?\" he whispered.  The figure wiggled and twisted vigorously, but there was no verbal reply.  \"I'll bet dollars to doughnuts they've put a stick in his mouth,\" said Jimmie, and this whispered observation was answered by another muscular demonstration.  \"Sure,\" muttered the boy, \"it is Pat an' he's tryin' to talk to me with his feet, an' them tied up plenty!\"  Bolo in hand he crept into the shelter, although the sound of voices told him that the people who had gone down the hill were now returning. He could not see the cords which held the still struggling man, but he found them with his fingers and cut them, not quite certain that he was serving a friend, but willing, under the circumstances, to take the risk. First the cords which held the feet were severed, then those which held the wooden gag in place, then that which confined the hands.  When this last cord was cut two muscular arms flew up and seized the boy about the neck, drawing his head down until his nose was buried in the wet clothes of the man he had released.  \"Let up!\" he muttered in a smothered voice.  Still the powerful arms drew him down, and the boy was beginning to wonder if he had not better use his bolo when a voice whispered:  \"Jimmie! Is it dead we both are?\"  \"We will soon be if you don't let up!\" answered Jimmie.  \"Jimmie from the Bowery?\" demanded the other.  \"Sure!\" was the reply. \"What is this, anyway, a catch-as-catch-can? If you don't let up I'll take a rib out with my bolo.\"  With a spring which almost keeled the boy over the figure sprang up, ducked under the dripping canvas, and crouched in the thicket from which Jimmie had observed the tent. Jimmie's first thought was to follow, then he thought of the remaining prisoners and turned to cut their bonds.  But he was too late. As he turned three men came to the front of the shelter and bent low for the purpose of entering. To have hesitated longer would have been to invite capture, and so, with a sigh of regret, the boy shot under the canvas and joined the other in the thicket.  \"It's leg bail for it!\" came the familiar voice of Pat Mack, and the boys poked their faces into the thicket and kept going, regardless of the thorns and creepers which tore at their garments and tripped their feet. It was so dark now that they could not see a hand held two inches from their eyes, but they kept on, making as little noise as possible.     CHAPTER VII.  A MISSING MOTOR BOAT.   \"You rapscallion,\" Pat Mack whispered, as the two came together in the embrace of a particularly tough creeper, \"how did you ever get here? I saw you last on the good old Bowery!\"  \"I didn't fly over,\" replied Jimmie. \"Here,\" he added, \"take this bolo an' cut that rope! What did you mean by chokin' me when I cut you loose?\"  \"A hug of affection!\" retorted the other. \"You looked like an angel to me! Did you flutter down from the sky in the rain?\"  \"I ought to give you a good punch for it!\" Jimmie replied. \"You near took the hide off me beautiful nose! Have you got that bloomin' steel cable cut? Seems to me they are comin' after us!\"  The boys stood perfectly still and listened. Above the patter of the rain, above the murmur of the trees, above the chattering of the aroused monkeys, came the crash of heavy bodies through the bushes, the sound of human voices.  \"Sure they are!\" whispered Pat, and they set off again.  Working their way painfully through the jungle, falling now and then over long vines, coming into contact with great trees and swinging parasites which brushed against their faces like snakes, the boys pressed on as rapidly as possible, but ever the sounds of pursuit came closer! The pursuers were more familiar with jungle methods than they, and no pretense of secrecy was made.  \"Have you got a gun?\" whispered Jimmie.  \"I haven't even got a toothpick,\" was the reply.  \"We'll have to fight before long,\" Jimmie said, panting with the exertion of the unfamiliar struggle with the jungle.  \"There's plenty of hollow trees about,\" suggested Pat. \"Why not hide in one of them until they pass?\"  The suggestion seemed a good one, for a moment. Then the uselessness of such an effort at concealment became apparent. With sinking hearts the boys heard the low whine of a hound!  \"I wonder how they managed to track us so easily,\" Jimmie said.  \"Give me the bolo,\" Pat said. \"I'll split the dog's head open if he comes near us. Use your gun on the men.\"  The boys did not give up hope of final escape, but pressed on for a time. However, the acclivity they were ascending grew steeper as they advanced, and they were obliged to stop now and then to rest. On one of these occasions they heard a commotion in the jungle just ahead of them. This was disheartening!  \"They've flanked us!\" whispered Pat.  The pursuers were carrying a torch which, in the rain, gave a dim light, but still served to direct their steps, and the glow of the flame now reached to the very spot where the lads stood. The bushes behind them parted and the glowing eyes of the hound looked up in their faces. Then the call of the beast told the men following that he had at last sighted his prey.  The boys turned to flee again, but came up against an almost perpendicular wall of rock. The pursuers saw them now and came on with cries of victory.  \"Guess they've got us!\" Pat said.  \"Not yet!\" Jimmie answered.  But, however courageous the lads might have proved themselves to be, they would have been taken in a moment had they not received unexpected assistance. The hound was almost at their feet when a shot was heard and the great beast fell to the ground, struggled for an instant, and lay still.  Another shot followed the first instantly, and the torch dropped from the uplifted hand of the evil-faced man who was carrying it in the lead. An intense, uncanny darkness followed the extinction of the torch, and the two boys took advantage of it to edge around the face of the rock which had blocked their progress. Without the help of the dog, and without the torch, the pursuers could do little, and stood on equal terms with the pursued.  It was impossible, of course, for the boys to make their way through the jungle without making any noise, and in a moment the pursuing party showed its temper by firing revengeful shots at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20212"],["title","Police Your Planet (#0)"],["body","YOUR PLANET                                By ERIC VAN LHIN         SCIENCE FICTION     AVALON BOOKS     22 EAST 60TH STREET NEW YORK      Copyright, 1956, by Eric van Lhin      [Transcriber's note: This is a rule 6 clearance.

XVII Security Payoff     POLICE YOUR PLANET     Chapter I  ONE WAY TICKET   There were ten passengers in the little pressurized cabin of the electric bus that shuttled between the rocket field and Marsport. Ten men, the driver--and Bruce Gordon.  He sat apart from the others, as he had kept to himself on the ten-day trip between Earth and Mars, with the yellow stub of his ticket still stuck defiantly in the band of his hat, proclaiming that Earth had paid his passage without his permission being asked. His big, lean body was slumped slightly in the seat. There was no expression on his face.  He listened to the driver explaining to a couple of firsters that they were actually on what appeared to be one of the mysterious canals when viewed from Earth. Every book on Mars gave the fact that the canals were either an illusion or something which could not be detected on the surface of the planet.  He glanced back toward the rocket that still pointed skyward back on the field, and then forward toward the city of Marsport, sprawling out in a mess of slums beyond the edges of the dome that had been built to hold air over the central part. And at last he stirred and reached for the yellow stub.  He grimaced at the ONE WAY stamped on it, then tore it into bits and let the pieces scatter over the floor. He counted them as they fell; thirty pieces, one for each year of his life. Little ones for the two years he'd wasted as a cop. Shreds for the four years as a kid in the ring before that--he'd never made the top. Bigger bits for two years also wasted in trying his hand at professional gambling; and the six final pieces that spelled his rise from a special reporter helping out with a police shake-up coverage, through a regular leg-man turning up rackets, and on up like a meteor until.... He'd made his big scoop, all right. He'd dug up enough about the Mercury scandals to double circulation.  And the government had explained what a fool he'd been for printing half of a story that was never supposed to be printed until all could be revealed. They'd given Bruce Gordon his final assignment.  He shrugged. He'd bought a suit of airtight coveralls and a helmet at the field; he had some cash, and a set of reader cards in his pocket. The supply house, Earthside, had assured him that this pattern had never been exported to Mars. With them and the knife he'd selected, he might get by.  The Solar Security office had given him the knife practice, to make sure he could use it, just as they'd made sure he hadn't taken extra money with him beyond the regulation amount.  \"You're a traitor, and we'd like nothing better than seeing your guts spilled,\" the Security man had told him. \"That paper you swiped was marked top secret. But we don't get many men with your background--cop, tinhorn, fighter--who have brains enough for our work. So you're bound for Mars, rather than the Mercury mines. If...\"  It was a big _if_, and a vague one. They needed men on Mars who could act as links in their information bureau, and be ready to work on their side when the expected trouble came. They wanted men who could serve them loyally, even without orders. If he did them enough service, they might let him back to Earth. If he caused trouble enough, they could still ship him to Mercury.  \"And suppose nothing happens?\" he asked.  \"Then who cares? You're just lucky enough to be alive.\"  \"And what makes you think I'm going to be a spy for Security?\"  The other had shrugged. \"Why not, Gordon? You've been a spy for a yellow scandal sheet. Why not for us?\"  Gordon had been smart enough to realize that perhaps Security was right.  They were in the slums around the city now. Marsport had been settled faster than it was ready to receive. Temporary buildings had been thrown up, and then had remained, decaying into deathtraps. It wasn't a pretty view that visitors got as they first reached Mars. But nobody except the romantic fools had ever thought frontiers were pretty.  The drummer who had watched Gordon tear up his yellow stub moved forward now. \"First time?\" he asked.  Gordon nodded, mentally cataloguing the drummer as the cockroach type, midway between the small-businessman slug and the petty-crook spider types that weren't worth bothering with. But the other took it as interest.  \"Been here dozens of times, myself. Risking your life just to go into Marsport. Why Congress doesn't clean it up, _I'll_ never know!\"  Gordon's mind switched to the readers in his bag. The cards were plastic, and should be good for a week or so of use before they showed wear. During that time, by playing it carefully, he should have his stake. Then, if the gaming tables here were as crudely run as an oldtimer he'd known on Earth had said, he could try a coup.  \"... be at Mother Corey's soon,\" the fat little drummer babbled on. \"Notorious--worst place on Mars. Take it from me, brother, that's something! Even the cops are afraid to go in there. See it? There, to your left!\"  The name was vaguely familiar as one of the sore spots of Marsport. Bruce Gordon looked, and spotted the ragged building, half a mile outside the dome. It had been a rocket-maintenance hangar once, then had been turned into temporary dwelling for the first deportees, when Earth began flooding Mars. Now, seeming to stand by habit alone, it radiated desolation and decay.  He stood up, grabbing for his bag, and spinning the drummer aside. He jerked forward, and caught the driver's shoulder. \"Getting off!\"  The driver shrugged his hand away. \"Don't be crazy, mister! They--\" He turned, saw it was Gordon, and his face turned blank. \"It's your life, buster,\" he said, and reached for the brake. \"I'll give you five minutes to get into coveralls and helmet and out through the airlock.\"  Gordon needed less than that; he'd practiced all the way from Earth. The transparent plastic of the coveralls went on easily enough, and his hands found the seals quickly. He slipped his few possessions into a bag at his belt, slid the knife into a spring holster above his wrist, and picked up the bowl-shaped helmet. It seated on a plastic seal, and the little air compressor at his back began to hum, ready to turn the thin wisp of Mars' atmosphere into a barely breathable pressure. He tested the Marspeaker--an amplifier and speaker in another pouch, designed to raise the volume of his voice to a level where it would carry through even the air of Mars.  The driver swore at the lash of sound, and grabbed for the airlock switch.         *       *       *       *       *  Gordon moved down unpaved streets that zig-zagged along, thick with the filth of garbage and poverty--the part of Mars never seen in the newsreels, outside the shock movies. Thin kids with big eyes and sullen mouths crowded the streets in their airsuits, yelling profanity. The street was filled with people watching with a numbed hunger for any kind of excitement.  It was late afternoon, obviously. Men were coming from the few bus routes, lugging tools and lunch baskets, slumped and beaten from labor in the atomic plants, the Martian conversion farms, and the industries that had come inevitably where inefficiency was better than the high prices of imports. The saloons were doing well enough, apparently, from the number that streamed in through their airlock entrances. But Gordon saw one of the bartenders paying money to a thickset person with an arrogant sneer; he knew then that the few profits from the cheap beer were never going home with the man. Storekeepers in the cheap little shops had the same lines on their faces as they saw on those of their customers.  Poverty and misery were the keynotes here, rather than the evil half-world the drummer had babbled about. But to Gordon's trained eyes, there was plenty of outright rottenness, too.  He grimaced, grateful that the supercharger on his airsuit filtered out some of the smell which the thin air carried. He'd thought he was familiar with human misery from his own Earth slum background. But there was no attempt to disguise it here.  Ahead, Mother Corey's reared up--a huge, ugly half-cylinder of pitted metal and native bricks, showing the patchwork of decades, before repairs had been abandoned. There were no windows, though once there had been; and the front was covered with a big sign that spelled out _Condemned_. The airseal was filthy, and there was no bell.  Gordon kicked against the side, waited, and kicked again. A slit opened and closed. He waited, then drew his knife and began prying at the worn cement around the airseal, looking for the lock that had been there.  The seal suddenly quivered, indicating that metal inside had been withdrawn. Gordon grinned tautly, stepped through, and pushed the blade against the inner plastic.  \"All right, all right,\" a voice whined out of the darkness. \"You don't have to puncture my seal. You're in.\"  \"Then call them off!\"  A wheezing chuckle answered him, and a phosphor bulb glowed weakly, shedding some light on a filthy hall. \"Okay, boys,\" the voice"]]]
