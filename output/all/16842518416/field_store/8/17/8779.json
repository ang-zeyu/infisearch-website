You don't know?    MARIANE   No.    VALERE   No?    MARIANE   What do you advise?    VALERE   I? My advice is, marry him, by all means.    MARIANE   That's your advice?    VALERE   Yes.    MARIANE   Do you mean it?    VALERE   Surely.   A splendid choice, and worthy of your acceptance.    MARIANE   Oh, very well, sir! I shall take your counsel.    VALERE   You'll find no trouble taking it, I warrant.    MARIANE   No more than you did giving it, be sure.    VALERE   I gave it, truly, to oblige you, madam.    MARIANE   And I shall take it to oblige you, sir.    Dorine (withdrawing to the back of the stage)   Let's see what this affair will come to.    VALERE   So,   That is your love? And it was all deceit   When you ...    MARIANE   I beg you, say no more of that.   You told me, squarely, sir, I should accept   The husband that is offered me; and I   Will tell you squarely that I mean to do so,   Since you have given me this good advice.    VALERE   Don't shield yourself with talk of my advice.   You had your mind made up, that's evident;   And now you're snatching at a trifling pretext   To justify the breaking of your word.    MARIANE   Exactly so.    VALERE   Of course it is; your heart   Has never known true love for me.    MARIANE   Alas!   You're free to think so, if you please.    VALERE   Yes, yes,   I'm free to think so; and my outraged love   May yet forestall you in your perfidy,   And offer elsewhere both my heart and hand.    MARIANE   No doubt of it; the love your high deserts   May win ...    VALERE   Good Lord, have done with my deserts!   I know I have but few, and you have proved it.   But I may find more kindness in another;   I know of someone, who'll not be ashamed   To take your leavings, and make up my loss.    MARIANE   The loss is not so great; you'll easily   Console yourself completely for this change.    VALERE   I'll try my best, that you may well believe.   When we're forgotten by a woman's heart,   Our pride is challenged; we, too, must forget;   Or if we cannot, must at least pretend to.   No other way can man such baseness prove,   As be a lover scorned, and still in love.    MARIANE   In faith, a high and noble sentiment.    VALERE   Yes; and it's one that all men must approve.   What! Would you have me keep my love alive,   And see you fly into another's arms   Before my very eyes; and never offer   To someone else the heart that you had scorned?    MARIANE   Oh, no, indeed! For my part, I could wish   That it were done already.    VALERE   What! You wish it?    MARIANE   Yes.    VALERE   This is insult heaped on injury;   I'll go at once and do as you desire.    (He takes a step or two as if to go away.)    MARIANE   Oh, very well then.    VALERE (turning back)   But remember this.   'Twas you that drove me to this desperate pass.    MARIANE   Of course.    VALERE (turning back again)   And in the plan that I have formed   I only follow your example.    MARIANE   Yes.    VALERE (at the door)   Enough; you shall be punctually obeyed.    MARIANE   So much the better.    VALERE (coming back again)   This is once for all.    MARIANE   So be it, then.    VALERE (He goes toward the door, but just as he reaches it, turns   around)   Eh?    MARIANE   What?    VALERE   You didn't call me?    MARIANE   I? You are dreaming.    VALERE   Very well, I'm gone. Madam, farewell.    (He walks slowly away.)    MARIANE   Farewell, sir.    DORINE   I must say   You've lost your senses and both gone clean daft!   I've let you fight it out to the end o' the chapter   To see how far the thing could go. Oho, there,   Mister Valere!    (She goes and seizes him by the arm, to stop him. He makes a great   show of resistance.)    VALERE   What do you want, Dorine?    DORINE   Come here.    VALERE   No, no, I'm quite beside myself.   Don't hinder me from doing as she wishes.    DORINE   Stop!    VALERE   No. You see, I'm fixed, resolved, determined.    DORINE   So!    MARIANE (aside)   Since my presence pains him, makes him go,   I'd better go myself, and leave him free.    DORINE (leaving Valere, and running after Mariane)   Now t'other! Where are you going?    MARIANE   Let me be.    DORINE.   Come back.    MARIANE   No, no, it isn't any use.    VALERE (aside)   'Tis clear the sight of me is torture to her;   No doubt, t'were better I should free her from it.    DORINE (leaving Mariane and running after Valere)   Same thing again! Deuce take you both, I say.   Now stop your fooling; come here, you; and you.    (She pulls first one, then the other, toward the middle of the stage.)    VALERE (to Dorine)   What's your idea?    MARIANE (to Dorine)   What can you mean to do?    DORINE   Set you to rights, and pull you out o' the scrape.    (To Valere)   Are you quite mad, to quarrel with her now?    VALERE   Didn't you hear the things she said to me?    DORINE (to Mariane)   Are you quite mad, to get in such a passion?    MARIANE   Didn't you see the way he treated me?    DORINE   Fools, both of you.    (To Valere)   She thinks of nothing else   But to keep faith with you, I vouch for it.    (To Mariane)   And he loves none but you, and longs for nothing   But just to marry you, I stake my life on't.    MARIANE (to Valere)   Why did you give me such advice then, pray?    VALERE (to Mariane)   Why ask for my advice on such a matter?    DORINE   You both are daft, I tell you. Here, your hands.    (To Valere)   Come, yours.    VALERE (giving Dorine his hand)   What for?    DORINE (to Mariane)   Now, yours.    MARIANE (giving Dorine her hand)   But what's the use?    DORINE   Oh, quick now, come along. There, both of you--   You love each other better than you think.    (Valere and Mariane hold each other's hands some time without looking   at each other.)    VALERE (at last turning toward Mariane)   Come, don't be so ungracious now about it;   Look at a man as if you didn't hate him.    (Mariane looks sideways toward Valere, with just a bit of a smile.)    DORINE   My faith and troth, what fools these lovers be!    VALERE (to Mariane)   But come now, have I not a just complaint?   And truly, are you not a wicked creature   To take delight in saying what would pain me?    MARIANE   And are you not yourself the most ungrateful ... ?    DORINE   Leave this discussion till another time;   Now, think how you'll stave off this plaguy marriage.    MARIANE   Then tell us how to go about it.    DORINE   Well,   We'll try all sorts of ways.    (To Mariane)   Your father's daft;    (To Valere)   This plan is nonsense.    (To Mariane)   You had better humour   His notions by a semblance of consent,   So that in case of danger, you can still   Find means to block the marriage by delay.   If you gain time, the rest is easy, trust me.   One day you'll fool them with a sudden illness,   Causing delay; another day, ill omens:   You've met a funeral, or broke a mirror,   Or dreamed of muddy water. Best of all,   They cannot marry you to anyone   Without your saying yes. But now, methinks,   They mustn't find you chattering together.    (To Valere)   You, go at once and set your friends at work   To make him keep his word to you; while we   Will bring the brother's influence to bear,   And get the step-mother on our side, too.   Good-bye.    VALERE (to Mariane)   Whatever efforts we may make,   My greatest hope, be sure, must rest on you.    MARIANE (to Valere)   I cannot answer for my father's whims;   But no one save Valere shall ever have me.    VALERE   You thrill me through with joy! Whatever comes ...    DORINE   Oho! These lovers! Never done with prattling!   Now go.    VALERE (starting to go, and coming back again)   One last word ...    DORINE   What a gabble and pother!   Be off! By this door, you. And you, by t'other.    (She pushes them off, by the shoulders, in opposite directions.)       ACT III      SCENE I    DAMIS, DORINE     DAMIS   May lightning strike me dead this very instant,   May I be everywhere proclaimed a scoundrel,   If any reverence or power shall stop me,   And if I don't do straightway something desperate!    DORINE   I beg you, moderate this towering passion;   Your father did but merely mention it.   Not all things that are talked of turn to facts;   The road is long, sometimes, from plans to acts.    DAMIS   No, I must end this paltry fellow's plots,   And he shall hear from me a truth or two.    DORINE   So ho! Go slow now. Just you leave the fellow--   Your father too--in your step-mother's hands.   She has some influence with this Tartuffe,   He makes a point of heeding all she says,   And I suspect that he is fond of her.   Would God 'twere true!--'Twould be the height of humour   Now, she has sent for him, in your behalf,   To sound him on this marriage, to find out   What his ideas are, and to show him plainly   What troubles he may cause, if he persists   In giving countenance to this design.   His man says, he's at prayers, I mustn't see him,   But likewise says, he'll presently be down.   So off with you, and let me wait for him.    DAMIS   I may be present at this interview.    DORINE   No, no! They must be left alone.    DAMIS   I won't   So much as speak to him.    DORINE   Go on! We know you   And your high tantrums. Just the way to spoil things!   Be off.    DAMIS   No, I must see--I'll keep my temper.    DORINE   Out on you, what a plague! He's coming. Hide!    (Damis goes and hides in the closet at the back of the stage.)      SCENE II    TARTUFFE, DORINE     TARTUFFE (speaking to his valet, off the stage, as soon as he sees   Dorine is there)   Lawrence, put up my hair-cloth shirt and scourge,   And pray that Heaven may shed its light upon you.   If any come to see me, say I'm gone   To share my alms among the prisoners.    DORINE (aside)   What affectation and what showing off!    TARTUFFE   What do you want with me?    DORINE   To tell you ...    TARTUFFE (taking a handkerchief from his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2027"],["title","Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite (#5)"],["body","ket)   Ah!   Before you speak, pray take this handkerchief.    DORINE   What?    TARTUFFE   Cover up that bosom, which I can't   Endure to look on. Things like that offend   Our souls, and fill our minds with sinful thoughts.    DORINE   Are you so tender to temptation, then,   And has the flesh such power upon your senses?   I don't know how you get in such a heat;   For my part, I am not so prone to lust,   And I could see you stripped from head to foot,   And all your hide not tempt me in the least.    TARTUFFE   Show in your speech some little modesty,   Or I must instantly take leave of you.    DORINE   No, no, I'll leave you to yourself; I've only   One thing to say: Madam will soon be down,   And begs the favour of a word with you.    TARTUFFE   Ah! Willingly.    DORINE (aside)   How gentle all at once!   My faith, I still believe I've hit upon it.    TARTUFFE   Will she come soon?    DORINE   I think I hear her now.   Yes, here she is herself; I'll leave you with her.      SCENE III    ELMIRE, TARTUFFE     TARTUFFE   May Heaven's overflowing kindness ever   Give you good health of body and of soul,   And bless your days according to the wishes   And prayers of its most humble votary!    ELMIRE   I'm very grateful for your pious wishes.   But let's sit down, so we may talk at ease.    TARTUFFE (after sitting down)   And how are you recovered from your illness?    ELMIRE (sitting down also)   Quite well; the fever soon let go its hold.    TARTUFFE   My prayers, I fear, have not sufficient merit   To have drawn down this favour from on high;   But each entreaty that I made to Heaven   Had for its object your recovery.    ELMIRE   You're too solicitous on my behalf.    TARTUFFE   We could not cherish your dear health too much;   I would have given mine, to help restore it.    ELMIRE   That's pushing Christian charity too far;   I owe you many thanks for so much kindness.    TARTUFFE   I do far less for you than you deserve.    ELMIRE   There is a matter that I wished to speak of   In private; I am glad there's no one here   To listen.    TARTUFFE   Madam, I am overjoyed.   'Tis sweet to find myself alone with you.   This is an opportunity I've asked   Of Heaven, many a time; till now, in vain.    ELMIRE   All that I wish, is just a word from you,   Quite frank and open, hiding nothing from me.    (DAMIS, without their seeing him, opens the closet door halfway.)    TARTUFFE   I too could wish, as Heaven's especial favour,   To lay my soul quite open to your eyes,   And swear to you, the trouble that I made   About those visits which your charms attract,   Does not result from any hatred toward you,   But rather from a passionate devotion,   And purest motives ...    ELMIRE   That is how I take it,   I think 'tis my salvation that concerns you.    TARTUFFE (pressing her finger tips)   Madam, 'tis so; and such is my devotion ...    ELMIRE   Ouch! but you squeeze too hard.    TARTUFFE   Excess of zeal.   In no way could I ever mean to hurt you,   And I'd as soon ...    (He puts his hand on her knee.)    ELMIRE   What's your hand doing there?    TARTUFFE   Feeling your gown; the stuff is very soft.    ELMIRE   Let be, I beg you; I am very ticklish.    (She moves her chair away, and Tartuffe brings his nearer.)    TARTUFFE (handling the lace yoke of Elmire's dress)   Dear me how wonderful in workmanship   This lace is! They do marvels, nowadays;   Things of all kinds were never better made.    ELMIRE   Yes, very true. But let us come to business.   They say my husband means to break his word.   And marry Mariane to you. Is't so?    TARTUFFE   He did hint some such thing; but truly, madam,   That's not the happiness I'm yearning after;   I see elsewhere the sweet compelling charms   Of such a joy as fills my every wish.    ELMIRE   You mean you cannot love terrestrial things.    TARTUFFE   The heart within my bosom is not stone.    ELMIRE   I well believe your sighs all tend to Heaven,   And nothing here below can stay your thoughts.    TARTUFFE   Love for the beauty of eternal things   Cannot destroy our love for earthly beauty;   Our mortal senses well may be entranced   By perfect works that Heaven has fashioned here.   Its charms reflected shine in such as you,   And in yourself, its rarest miracles;   It has displayed such marvels in your face,   That eyes are dazed, and hearts are rapt away;   I could not look on you, the perfect creature,   Without admiring Nature's great Creator,   And feeling all my heart inflamed with love   For you, His fairest image of Himself.   At first I trembled lest this secret love   Might be the Evil Spirit's artful snare;   I even schooled my heart to flee your beauty,   Thinking it was a bar to my salvation.   But soon, enlightened, O all lovely one,   I saw how this my passion may be blameless,   How I may make it fit with modesty,   And thus completely yield my heart to it.   'Tis I must own, a great presumption in me   To dare make you the offer of my heart;   My love hopes all things from your perfect goodness,   And nothing from my own poor weak endeavour.   You are my hope, my stay, my peace of heart;   On you depends my torment or my bliss;   And by your doom of judgment, I shall be   Blest, if you will; or damned, by your decree.    ELMIRE   Your declaration's turned most gallantly;   But truly, it is just a bit surprising.   You should have better armed your heart, methinks,   And taken thought somewhat on such a matter.   A pious man like you, known everywhere ...    TARTUFFE   Though pious, I am none the less a man;   And when a man beholds your heavenly charms,   The heart surrenders, and can think no more.   I know such words seem strange, coming from me;   But, madam, I'm no angel, after all;   If you condemn my frankly made avowal   You only have your charming self to blame.   Soon as I saw your more than human beauty,   You were thenceforth the sovereign of my soul;   Sweetness ineffable was in your eyes,   That took by storm my still resisting heart,   And conquered everything, fasts, prayers, and tears,   And turned my worship wholly to yourself.   My looks, my sighs, have spoke a thousand times;   Now, to express it all, my voice must speak.   If but you will look down with gracious favour   Upon the sorrows of your worthless slave,   If in your goodness you will give me comfort   And condescend unto my nothingness,   I'll ever pay you, O sweet miracle,   An unexampled worship and devotion.   Then too, with me your honour runs no risk;   With me you need not fear a public scandal.   These court gallants, that women are so fond of,   Are boastful of their acts, and vain in speech;   They always brag in public of their progress;   Soon as a favour's granted, they'll divulge it;   Their tattling tongues, if you but trust to them,   Will foul the altar where their hearts have worshipped.   But men like me are so discreet in love,   That you may trust their lasting secrecy.   The care we take to guard our own good name   May fully guarantee the one we love;   So you may find, with hearts like ours sincere,   Love without scandal, pleasure without fear.    ELMIRE   I've heard you through--your speech is clear, at least.   But don't you fear that I may take a fancy   To tell my husband of your gallant passion,   And that a prompt report of this affair   May somewhat change the friendship which he bears you?    TARTUFFE   I know that you're too good and generous,   That you will pardon my temerity,   Excuse, upon the score of human frailty,   The violence of passion that offends you,   And not forget, when you consult your mirror,   That I'm not blind, and man is made of flesh.    ELMIRE   Some women might do otherwise, perhaps,   But I am willing to employ discretion,   And not repeat the matter to my husband;   But in return, I'll ask one thing of you:   That you urge forward, frankly and sincerely,   The marriage of Valere to Mariane;   That you give up the unjust influence   By which you hope to win another's rights;   And ...      SCENE IV    ELMIRE, DAMIS, TARTUFFE     DAMIS (coming out of the closet-room where he had been hiding)   No, I say! This thing must be made public.   I was just there, and overheard it all;   And Heaven's goodness must have brought me there   On purpose to confound this scoundrel's pride   And grant me means to take a signal vengeance   On his hypocrisy and arrogance,   And undeceive my father, showing up   The rascal caught at making love to you.    ELMIRE   No, no; it is enough if he reforms,   Endeavouring to deserve the favour shown him.   And since I've promised, do not you belie me.   'Tis not my way to make a public scandal;   An honest wife will scorn to heed such follies,   And never fret her husband's ears with them.    DAMIS   You've reasons of your own for acting thus;   And I have mine for doing otherwise.   To spare him now would be a mockery;   His bigot's pride has triumphed all too long   Over my righteous anger, and has caused   Far too much trouble in our family.   The rascal all too long has ruled my father,   And crossed my sister's love, and mine as well.   The traitor now must be unmasked before him:   And Providence has given me means to do it.   To Heaven I owe the opportunity,   And if I did not use it now I have it,   I should deserve to lose it once for all.    ELMIRE   Damis ...    DAMIS   No, by your leave; I'll not be counselled.   I'm overjoyed. You needn't try to tell me   I must give up the pleasure of revenge.   I'll make an end of this affair at once;   And, to content me, here's my father now.      SCENE V    ORGON, ELMIRE, DAMIS, TARTUFFE     DAMIS   Father, we've news to welcome your arrival,   That's altogether novel, and surprising.   You are well paid for your caressing care,   And this fine gentleman rewards your love   Most handsomely, with zeal that seeks no less   Than your dishonour, as has now been proven.   I've just surprised him making to your wife   The shameful offer of a guilty"]]]
