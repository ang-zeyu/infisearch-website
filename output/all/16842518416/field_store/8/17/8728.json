He belonged to the Wolf Patrol, an' was a chum of Ned's. You remember him, Ned?\"  \"Pat Mack?\" repeated Ned. \"Who would ever forget him? Why, that red-headed Irishman is not a person to be forgotten, if once known. Why do you think he is with the party we are following, Jimmie?\"  \"Because Captain Godwin said one of the young men with the Lieutenant has hair so red that he didn't need a light to go to bed by. That's Pat Mack! And if he is with that bunch there'll be something doing before long. That boy will fight a rattlesnake an' give him the first bite.\"  \"He is all to the good as a pugilist,\" Ned said. \"That was the trouble with him in New York. He was always in some kind of a mess because of his quick temper and his ready fists. I hope it is Pat who is leaving these signs.\"  \"You bet it is,\" Jimmie insisted. \"Say, look here! Who's rockin' this boat?\"  The boys were all sitting quietly in their seats, but the _Manhattan_ was rocking in a manner not accounted for by the storm. Motioning the others to remain where they were, Ned arose and passed out of the cabin.  The boat was still swaying violently, and Ned could at first see no good reason for it, but presently a commotion in the water, a commotion not caused by the wind and rain, caught his eyes and he advanced to the stern. After looking into the water for a moment he went to the cabin and beckoned to the boys.  \"If you don't mind getting soaking wet,\" he said, \"come out here.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Frank, lazily.  \"Is it anything good to eat?\" asked Jimmie.  Jack made no response but bounded forward and looked over the edge of the boat into the bay. What he saw was a great head with protruding jaws and a long, dark back covered with enormous half defined scales, like armor plate.  \"What is it?\" he asked, drawing a revolver from his pocket.  Ned pushed his hand back and the weapon was returned to a pocket.  \"Don't shoot,\" he said. \"We are not yet ready to announce our presence here.\"  \"But what is that thing?\" demanded Jack. \"Is he trying to eat up the boat?\"  \"That is a crocodile,\" Ned replied. \"Corker, eh?\"  \"Will he bite?\" asked Jack, reaching for a boathook.  \"Jump in and see,\" laughed Ned. \"They live on fish, but eat dogs and men when they feel just right. The rivers and lakes of the Philippines swarm with them.\"  Jimmie and Frank now came out of the cabin and looked down at the crocodile.  \"He's scratching his old nose on the boat!\" Jimmie said. \"That's what makes it rock so!\"  \"He thinks it's a sandwich, with meat inside,\" laughed Frank. \"Suppose we give him a poke in the ribs?\"  He reached forward with the boathook, which he took from Jack's hand, and jabbed at the creature, which did not appear to mind the presence of the boys at all, but continued his nosing of the boat.  \"His hide is as tough as the crust of the pies Bridget used to make!\" the boy said, jabbing harder than before and throwing his weight on the handle of the hook.  Just then the boat shunted to one side, the crocodile swished away, and Frank fell headlong into the agitated waters of the little bay. Jack saw him going and tried to catch him, but did not succeed.  The crocodile had turned away from the boat when Frank struck the water with a great splash, but he turned back and surveyed the submerged figure with some degree of interest.  Frank of course went down under the surface as he fell, and remained there for a second. When his body rose toward the surface the crocodile approached him. Jimmie and Jack drew their revolvers.  \"Don't shoot!\" commanded Ned.  \"He'll eat Frank alive!\" whispered Jimmie.  \"He's making a grab for his leg now!\" Jack added.  Frank came to the surface and struck out for the boat, which was only a few strokes away, the crocodile following in his wake, the giant armor-plated body moving through the water stolidly and without visible means of motion. The rough back looked like a log which had lain long in the waters of a swamp and had caught rust from mineral deposits and a nasty brown from decaying vegetation.  Frank knew the danger he was in, but did not seem to understand that the boys on the boat were aware of his peril, for he swung his body out of the water and whirling, pointed to the crocodile. As he did so the monster speeded forward and snapped at his arm.  \"Shoot! Shoot!\" cried Jimmie.  But no shots were fired. When the great mouth of the monster opened something shot out from the boat and landed squarely between the extended jaws of the crocodile. There was a snap, a crunching sound, then the water was whipped into commotion by the writhing body of the monster.  A rope was thrown to Frank and he was soon on board, not much wetter than his chums, standing in the driving rain, and not at all injured by his adventure.  \"Cripes!\" Jimmie cried, as Frank stood panting by his side, \"I thought he had you where the whale had Jonah.\"  \"What was that you fed him?\" asked Frank of Ned.  \"Just a bottle of gasoline which lay here,\" was the reply.  \"You couldn't make a throw like that again in a hundred years!\" Frank said.  \"If you're goin' to feed gasoline to the crocodiles,\" grinned Jimmie, \"I'll notify the government.\"  \"If the breed listens to what that fellow has to say of gasoline as an article of food,\" Ned laughed, \"there won't be much demand for it.\"  \"He'd have had my arm if you hadn't hit the mark,\" Frank said. \"I'll owe you an arm as long as I live, old man!\"  \"And that big fish owes Uncle Sam a quart of gasoline and a good blue glass bottle,\" laughed Jack. \"I wonder how it will set on his tummy?\"  \"Now,\" Ned said, \"I'm as wet as it is possible to get, so I'm going on shore to see if our Boy Scout left any mail for us. I'm getting anxious to catch up with the Lieutenant and his abductors.\"  \"I'm goin' too!\" said Jimmie.  \"You're not,\" Ned replied. \"I'm not going to the trouble of keeping track of you in that wilderness.\"  \"All right!\" Jimmie grunted, apparently resigned to his fate, but when Ned rowed ashore and disappeared in the thicket which skirted the bay the little fellow recklessly slipped into the water and came out unharmed on the beach farther to the south than Ned had landed. He stood for a moment with the salt water running out of his hair and over his freckled face, made an amusing grimace at the boys in the boat, and scurried into the jungle.  \"The little dunce!\" Jack exclaimed.  \"If he keeps close to Ned he will be all right,\" Frank observed, \"but if he goes to wandering about on his own account he will get into trouble. I've got a hunch that the people we are following are on that island.\"  In five minutes Ned made his appearance, rowing swiftly out to the boat.  \"They are there!\" he exclaimed. \"I found the trail mark and the direction. A yard from the last direction I found the triple warning three times repeated. You know what that means?\"  \"Life or death,\" was the reply, and the three boys stood looking into each other's faces for a moment without speaking.  \"I guess they're going to murder the prisoners,\" Jack said, presently, breaking the painful silence.  \"That is what the sign seems to read,\" Ned said, gravely.  \"Then we may as well be getting out our guns,\" Frank said.  Ned nodded, and turned toward the shore again. In a moment he faced his chums again, his eyes startled and anxious.  \"Where's Jimmie?\" he asked.  \"He went ashore!\"  \"Didn't you see him?\"  Ned turned from Frank to Jack and then pointed toward an elevation toward the center of the island.  The clouds hung low and the rain was still falling in torrents, but under the gray sky and through the downpour of the rain two columns of smoke lifted an eloquent voice.  \"That's a Boy Scout call!\" exclaimed Jack.  \"Two columns of smoke,\" Frank said, \"mean 'Help'! Jimmie couldn't have kindled two fires since he has been gone, could he?\"  \"Of course not,\" Jack replied. \"That's Pat Mack, the red-headed rascal!\"  \"I bet he wishes he was back on Chatham Square!\" observed Frank.  The boys waited ten minutes, but Jimmie did not make his appearance.  \"He's in trouble!\" cried Frank. \"We better go and see what kind of a fix he's gotten into.\"  \"It may be,\" Ned said, after a short pause, \"that he has seen the call for help, and is making his way in that direction.\"  \"That is just like him!\" Jack burst out.  \"Are we going in there after him?\" Frank asked.  \"We are likely to lose him in the thicket if we go,\" Ned cautioned, \"and it seems to me that we ought to wait a short time. He is wise enough not to go butting into a camp.\"  \"What sort of a place is it in there?\" asked Jack.  \"It is one of the nameless islands of the Babuyan group,\" Ned answered. \"Like most of the others, it is of volcanic formation. There is a central elevation, and a stream of good size starts up there somewhere and runs into a bay farther north. I was thinking of speeding up and trying to get into the interior by way of the river.\"  \"With the engine barking like a terrier in a rat pit!\" said Frank.  \"For once,\" said Ned, with a smile, \"you have said a good thing! We've got to lie here and wait until dark. Then we can advance through the jungle and look for their campfire.\"  \"Perhaps they won't build a fire.\"  This from Frank, who was stuffing his pockets with cartridges.  \"Of course they will!\" Jack put in. \"They will have to keep the wildcats away.\"  \"Wildcats!\" laughed Frank. \"There isn't a wildcat within a thousand miles of this island.\"  \"Don't you ever think it,\" Jack insisted. \"There are plenty of wildcats in the Philippines, and snakes, and lizards. In fact, the islands are not unlike the Isthmus of Panama in this regard. And monkeys! Well, we've heard enough chattering already to put us wise to them.\"  As the boy spoke a great chattering broke out in a thicket only a few rods away from the beach. The monkeys seemed frightened, and moving toward the shore.  \"Jimmie is in there!\" Ned exclaimed. \"I wish I could chloroform the little pests. They will betray the presence "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20208"],["title","Boy Scouts in the Philippines; Or, The Key to the Treaty Box (#7)"],["body","the lad.\"  While the boys waited, wondering what was to be the outcome of the dangerous situation, the sharp whistle of a launch came from the opposite side of the island. The first blast was followed by three others, in quick succession, and then a shot was heard from the interior.  \"This must be receiving day for the little brown men!\" said Jack. \"There's a boat over there talking to them. What about it, Ned?\"  \"If you boys will promise not to leave the boat,\" Ned said, \"I'll go ashore and try to find out what is going on. This island lies on the rim of the China Sea, and that boat may be from the land of the Celestials!\"  \"Bringing arms to put Uncle Sam to the bad!\" exclaimed Frank. \"I'd like to pull their pigtails!\"  The boys promised not to leave the _Manhattan_, and Ned rowed ashore and struck into the jungle. There was now an uproar of chattering all over the island, it seemed, and he walked swiftly under cover of the racket. In half an hour he was on an elevation which gave him a view of the China Sea. What he saw caused him to drop suddenly to the ground.     CHAPTER VI.  THE LOW CALL OF A WOLF.   When Jimmie left the _Manhattan_ he thought it would be perfectly easy to follow Ned into the jungle. Before leaving Captain Godwin's charge the boys had been provided with bolos, and the youngster slipped one under his jacket before leaving the motor boat. This he used to good purpose, though with great caution, as he crept through the thickets.  As is well known, it is almost impossible to make headway in a Philippine forest without chopping down creepers and tangled vines. The bolo is always in use by parties hunting or exploring. It is a short, heavy sword, or knife, similar to the machete of Cuba, and is frequently used in warfare. In the hands of an expert it becomes a very effective weapon.  Gaining the thicket, Jimmie stood still and listened for some indication of the presence of his patrol leader. But the patter of the rain, the rustling of the great leaves, the scolding of the wet and alarmed monkeys in the trees about him, served to shut out any other sounds.  He walked as fast as he could through the jungle toward the center of the island, or in the direction which he believed to be the center. Always his way was uphill, and now and then he was obliged to draw himself up some acclivity by pulling, hand over hand, on a creeper trailing from a tree.  Certain that he could find his way back, he did not blaze the way. Here and there he hewed down a thorny limb which tore at his clothes, or cut a creeper from a tree, but he made no effort to mark his path.  Occasionally he came to a little glade, a space clear of trees but hemmed in by the eternal jungle just the same. Here the way was choked with rank cogon grass, growing from eight to twelve feet high. He found this as mean a growth to pass through as any briar patch or cane-brake.  Cogon grass seems a useless parasite on the bosom of old Mother Earth, and yet it presents a compensation in its gorgeous white bloom, for, like the poppy, the cogon is a show-piece of nature, and she flaunts it in places where beauty is needed, too. Jimmie had never seen a field of buckwheat in blossom, or he might have compared the cogon stretches to fields in the United States at certain seasons of the year.  Even in his haste, in the uncomfortable day, the boy stopped to gaze in wonder at the wonderful balete tree, which is a representative of the fig family. This tree begins life as a parasite, at least it springs to life in a crotch of some other tree. Here it thrives on the humus and decayed vegetable matter and sends long, winding tendrils down to the ground.  These tendrils take root and grow with such vigor that the supporting trunk is rapidly enveloped in a coalescing mass of stems, while its own branches are overtopped by the usurper, which kills it eventually as much by stealing its sunshine as by appropriating the soil at its base. When very old these trees possess a massive trunk, usually, with a large cavity in the middle where the trunk of the other tree rotted out. Some of the younger trees, however, seem to stand on stilts.  Jimmie saw many things to marvel at, for a Philippine forest is not at all like a forest in the states of New York or Illinois. In the glades he saw plants of enormous size, with leaves seven feet long. He came upon rattan or bejuco thickets, where thorns, pointing down the stems like barbs on a fish-hook, snatched at his clothes and clung to them too.  A variety of this plant has a stem, trailing on the ground, five hundred feet long. This stem is hollow and divided into compartments by diaphragms at the joints, like the bamboo. Each compartment contains about a mouthful of pure water.  Jimmie climbed upward for half an hour, thinking every moment that he would come upon some trace of Ned, but Ned, as the reader knows, was at that time waiting in the cabin of the _Manhattan_ for the return of his friend. Unconsciously he wandered off to the right, or north, and presently came to an elevation from which he could overlook the rain-splashed waters of the China Sea.  By the time he reached this position Ned was also in the forest, hoping to meet Jimmie as well as to learn the meaning of the signals from the unknown launch and the firing on the island. Ned, however, for a long time kept to the left, and when at last he came to an elevation he was at least a mile away from that to which Jimmie had ascended.  From the hill--it could not be termed a mountain, though it was of volcanic formation--Jimmie looked into a glade from which the smoke of a fire ascended. He would have observed the two columns of smoke which had been seen from the motor boat had he reached the position earlier, or if he had not been surrounded by the thicket when the Boy Scout signal rose to the sky.  He could see people moving about the fire, which was partially protected from the storm by a heavy canvas on the windward side. A crude shelter composed of great leaves and canvas was also seen, and in this he thought he saw several reclining figures. By this time the boy had given up all hope of coming upon Ned, and also of finding his way back to the _Manhattan_ without a careful study of the location.  From the place where he stood he could look over a large portion of the island. He could see a river running to the east, and wondered if the bay in which the motor boat was lay not near the mouth of the stream. Still, there were many indentations in the shores of the little isle; he could not discover the _Manhattan_ in any of them.  He studied over the situation for a time and then arrived at the conclusion that he could best find his way back to the boat by following the line of the coast. That, however, necessitated a long journey and, perhaps, the swimming of streams which would doubtless take him far into the night, and a Philippine jungle is no place to travel in the darkness. Besides being decidedly uncomfortable, such a trip would be dangerous. Even if there were no wildcats on the island, there were plenty of reptiles. Then he caught sight of a launch off to the east and changed his plans.  His idea was to circle the camp and gain a position between it and the place where the launch had made its appearance. If the people on the boat were planning to land he wanted to see them before they reached the camp. If they were enemies he thought he could avoid them readily enough; if they were friends they might assist him in releasing the prisoners.  \"Of course they're in with the game that's goin' on, though,\" he mused, as he made his way around the hill. \"If they wasn't, what would they be comin' to the island for? There's no one here to visit--or wouldn't be if this party of dagoes hadn't landed. The men in the launch are here to meet the others, and that's all there is to it. I'm goin' to see what their business is!\"  It was growing dim over the forest when Jimmie gained the position he sought, and there were lights in the launch down in a little bay and lights in the camp halfway up the hill. The rain still came down heavily, driven with considerable force by the wind, and the boy was, of course, soaked to the skin and suffering from the stings of the insects which swarm in Philippine forests, but still he waited patiently for some signs of communication between the people on the boat and those in the camp.  There was no stir in the thicket which lay between the two, and Jimmie concluded that he had arrived too late to witness the meeting of the two parties. The next thing to do was to get as close to the camp as he could without danger of detection and observe what was taking place there. It might be even possible, he thought, to get near enough to hear something of the conversation.  With this object in view he moved as stealthily as possible through the jungle, up the hill, toward the fire, shining dimly in the rain. Much to his surprise he found no guards posted about the camp. When fifty yards away, concealed from any possible view of those about the fire by a mass of creepers, he saw that the inhabitants of the camp were hustling about in the work of building a good-sized shelter of the huge leaves which grew about. The reclining forms in the shelter he had first seen were now only partly in sight.  \"They are tryin' to keep the prisoners dry, anyway,\" the boy thought.  The shelter last spoken of was at the right of the fire, and Jimmie circled off so as to reach it from the rear, his purpose being to learn if the persons lying there were really the men who had been carried away from the island where Captain Godwin had his headquarters.  Presently he came upon a group of four people, standing, somewhat protected from the storm, under a great tree. He drew as close as he dared, even risking discovery, and listened. He could hear voices above the wailing of the wind and the patter of the rain, but could not understand what was being said. The"]]]
