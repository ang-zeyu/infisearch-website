[Illustration]      The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea         In a beautiful pea-green boat,      They took some honey, and plenty of money         Wrapped up in a five-pound note.  [Illustration]      The Owl looked up to the stars above,         And sang to a small guitar,      \"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,         What a beautiful Pussy you are,                 You are,                 You are!         What a beautiful Pussy you are!\"  [Illustration]      Pussy said to the Owl, \"You elegant fowl!         How charmingly sweet you sing!      O let us be married! too long we have tarried:         But what shall we do for a ring?\"  [Illustration]      They sailed away for a year and a day,         To the land where the Bong-tree grows,      And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,         With a ring at the end of his nose,                 His nose,                 His nose,         With a ring at the end of his nose.  [Illustration]      \"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling         Your ring?\" Said the Piggy, \"I will.\"  [Illustration]      So they took it away, and were married next day         By the Turkey who lives on the hill.      They din√®d on mince, and slices of quince         Which they ate with a runcible spoon;  [Illustration]      And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,         They danced by the light of the moon,                 The moon,                 The moon,         They danced by the light of the moon.     The Duck  and  The Kangaroo.       Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,         \"Good gracious! how you hop     Over the fields and the water too,         As if you never would stop!  [Illustration]      My life is a bore in this nasty pond,     And I long to go out in the world beyond!  [Illustration]      I wish I could hop like you!\"     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.  [Illustration]      \"Please give me a ride on your back!\"         Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.      \"I would sit quite still, and say nothing but 'Quack,'         The whole of the long day through!  [Illustration]      And we'd go to the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,     Over the land, and over the sea;--         Please take me a ride! O do!\"         Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.      Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,         \"This requires some little reflection;     Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,         And there seems but one objection,  [Illustration]      Which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,     Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,         And would probably give me the roo-         Matiz.\" said the Kangaroo.  [Illustration]      Said the Duck, \"As I sate on the rocks,         I have thought over that completely,     And I bought four pairs of worsted socks         Which fit my web-feet neatly  [Illustration]      And to keep out the cold I've bought a cloak     And every day a cigar I'll smoke,         All to follow my own dear true         Love of a Kangaroo!\"      Said the Kangaroo, \"I'm ready!         All in the moonlight pale;     But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!         And quite at the end of my tail!\"      So away they went with a hop and a bound,     And they hopped the whole world three times round;         And who so happy,--O who,         As the Duck and the Kangaroo?

Disput._ i. 12.     TO MY OLD FRIEND  JOHN SUTHERLAND BLACK, LL.D.  I DEDICATE AFFECTIONATELY  A WORK  WHICH OWES MUCH TO HIS ENCOURAGEMENT     PREFACE   The following lectures were delivered on Lord Gifford's Foundation before the University of St. Andrews in the early winters of 1911 and 1912. They are printed nearly as they were spoken, except that a few passages, omitted for the sake of brevity in the oral delivery, have been here restored and a few more added. Further, I have compressed the two introductory lectures into one, striking out some passages which on reflection I judged to be irrelevant or superfluous. The volume incorporates twelve lectures on \"The Fear and Worship of the Dead\" which I delivered in the Lent and Easter terms of 1911 at Trinity College, Cambridge, and repeated, with large additions, in my course at St. Andrews.  The theme here broached is a vast one, and I hope to pursue it hereafter by describing the belief in immortality and the worship of the dead, as these have been found among the other principal races of the world both in ancient and modern times. Of all the many forms which natural religion has assumed none probably has exerted so deep and far-reaching an influence on human life as the belief in immortality and the worship of the dead; hence an historical survey of this most momentous creed and of the practical consequences which have been deduced from it can hardly fail to be at once instructive and impressive, whether we regard the record with complacency as a noble testimony to the aspiring genius of man, who claims to outlive the sun and the stars, or whether we view it with pity as a melancholy monument of fruitless labour and barren ingenuity expended in prying into that great mystery of which fools profess their knowledge and wise men confess their ignorance.  J. G. FRAZER. Cambridge, _9th February 1913._     CONTENTS   Dedication  Preface  Table of Contents  Lecture I.--Introduction  Natural theology, three modes of handling it, the dogmatic, the philosophical, and the historical, pp. 1 _sq._; the historical method followed in these lectures, 2 _sq._; questions of the truth and moral value of religious beliefs irrelevant in an historical enquiry, 3 _sq._; need of studying the religion of primitive man and possibility of doing so by means of the comparative method, 5 _sq._; urgent need of investigating the native religion of savages before it disappears, 6 _sq._; a portion of savage religion the theme of these lectures, 7 _sq._; the question of a supernatural revelation dismissed, 8 _sq._; theology and religion, their relations, 9; the term God defined, 9 _sqq._; monotheism and polytheism, 11; a natural knowledge of God, if it exists, only possible through experience, 11 _sq._; the nature of experience, 12 _sq._; two kinds of experience, an inward and an outward, 13 _sq._; the conception of God reached historically through both kinds of experience, 14; inward experience or inspiration, 14 _sq._; deification of living men, 16 _sq._; outward experience as a source of the idea of God, 17; the tendency to seek for causes, 17 _sq._; the meaning of cause, 18 _sq._; the savage explains natural processes by the hypothesis of spirits or gods, 19 _sq._; natural processes afterwards explained by hypothetical forces and atoms instead of by hypothetical spirits and gods, 20 _sq._; nature in general still commonly explained by the hypothesis of a deity, 21 _sq._; God an inferential or hypothetical cause, 22 _sq._; the deification of dead men, 23-25; such a deification presupposes the immortality of the human soul or rather its survival for a longer or shorter time after death, 25 _sq._; the conception of human immortality suggested both by inward experience, such as dreams, and by outward experience, such as the resemblances of the living to the dead, 26-29; the lectures intended to collect evidence as to the belief in immortality among certain savage races, 29 _sq._; the method to be descriptive rather than comparative or philosophical, 30.
