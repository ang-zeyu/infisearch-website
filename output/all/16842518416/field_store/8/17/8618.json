And Broad Brook was no more than a narrow trickle. Every morning the sun rose streaming hot, to beat down upon Pleasant Valley all day long until it sank--a round, red ball--behind Blue Mountain each night.  At last, one afternoon, Farmer Green and the hired man started for the woods on a run. They had seen a wisp of smoke curling up from the tree tops. And they knew that the woods were on fire.  There was a high wind that day. And if they hadn't worked lively there's no telling how far the fire would have spread. As it was, glowing bits came sailing down from the hill and settled in the valley. But luckily they did no damage. At least, no other fire had started anywhere when the men came home from the woods and said that all was safe again.  Some of the small folk that lived in the fields knew what was going on. But Mrs. Ladybug never guessed that there had been a fire. She was so busy, working among the apple trees, that she hadn't noticed any unusual stir. And no one took the trouble to tell her about it.  Everyone had put thoughts of fire out of his mind when along toward evening a loud clanging rang out upon the air.  \"What's that?\" people asked one another.  And all at once somebody shouted, \"It's Mrs. Ladybug's dinner bell!\"  Far and wide through orchard, garden and meadow the neighbors took up the cry. \"Fire! Fire! Mrs. Ladybug's ringing the alarm! Her house is on fire!\"  Back and forth they hurried, trying to find Mrs. Ladybug.  \"At last--\" they told one another--\"at last we're going to find out where her house is.\"  And they did. At least, they soon discovered Mrs. Ladybug standing beside a blazing dwelling near the pasture fence. With all her hands (and she had several!) she was ringing her bell furiously.  \"We'll help you!\" her friends all cried. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Ladybug! We'll have the fire out soon. Be calm!\"  But there was nothing they could do. The fire raged so fiercely that they couldn't get near enough to it to fight it. And before long it had burned itself out. There was nothing left of the house but ashes.  \"What a pity!\" said Mrs. Ladybug's neighbors. \"It was a fine, big house.\"  And then some one cried, \"What about the children? Where are they?\"  Nobody knew. If Mrs. Ladybug did, she was too overcome to speak.  People looked very solemn. They hoped her children hadn't burned.  And then--then Mr. Meadow Mouse came running up all out of breath.  \"Sakes alive!\" he screamed. \"My house is ruined. I wouldn't have had this happen for anything. But it doesn't matter, for I can easily build another.\"  Mrs. Ladybug's neighbors crowded about her, all asking the same question.  \"Wasn't this your house?\"  \"No!\" she admitted. \"No, it wasn't.\" And then she made an astonishing confession. \"I've never owned a house,\" she said. \"I've never had one in all my life. I _can't_ have a house. I couldn't get one that was big enough.  \"I have so many children that I don't know what to do,\" said little Mrs. Ladybug.     XXI  PLANS FOR WINTER   IT was almost fall. The nights--and some of the days--were chilly. Those that had spent the whole summer out of doors began to think about where they should pass the winter. Yet everybody was amazed by the news that Mrs. Ladybug spread broadcast. She said that she expected, soon, to go into winter quarters.  \"Humph!\" cried Daddy Longlegs' wife when she heard what Mrs. Ladybug was saying. \"She never had any quarters, so far as anyone knows. Mrs. Ladybug hasn't been able to tear herself away from the orchard long enough to live anywhere except in the apple trees.\"  It was plain that Daddy Longlegs' wife didn't believe what Mrs. Ladybug was telling her neighbors. And there were many more folk that agreed with her.  Little Mrs. Ladybug smiled a knowing smile when she heard what her friends thought.  \"They'll see! They'll see!\" she said. \"I'm going to spend the winter in the biggest and finest house on this farm.\"  That was all she would tell. She wouldn't breathe another word about her plans. And naturally, every one became very curious. There wasn't a soul that wasn't agog to know what Mrs. Ladybug intended to do.  The neighbors asked her, begged her, teased her--some even threatened her. But she declined to answer. She said that if she told where she expected to pass the cold months everybody would want to go to the same place and maybe there wouldn't be any room left for her.  Perhaps some of her friends _had_ intended to follow her into her winter quarters. Anyhow, many of them looked guilty when she made that remark. And a few of them looked angry, and declared that Mrs. Ladybug was selfish.  \"If the house is as big as she claims it is, it ought to hold a few extra guests without being crowded,\" they grumbled.  \"Guests--\" said Mrs. Ladybug--\"guests should always wait for an invitation.\"  \"Have you had one?\" Buster Bumblebee asked her.  Mrs. Ladybug did not answer his question. Most people thought Buster Bumblebee a stupid fellow. Many people paid little heed to him. Yet strange to say, he often hit the nail on the head, so to speak. And this time he made Mrs. Ladybug somewhat uncomfortable. She had had no invitation to spend the winter in the fine, big house. But she didn't care to have her neighbors know that.  \"There's just one thing to do,\" Buster Bumblebee decided. \"I'll ask the Carpenter Bee if he's building a house for her.\"  So he went to the big poplar by the brook, where the Carpenter Bee lived. And that mild person himself--sawdust-covered as usual--answered Buster's knock at his door.  \"Are you building a house for Mrs. Ladybug?\" Buster Bumblebee inquired.  \"No!\" said the Carpenter. \"We couldn't agree. She wanted me to work twelve hours a day. And I wanted to work twenty-four. I told her I must have _some_ time to rest. But she couldn't see things as I did.\"  Buster Bumblebee was puzzled.  \"I don't understand,\" he said.  The Carpenter kindly made matters clear to him.  \"I rest only when I'm working,\" he explained.     XXII  MRS. LADYBUG LEAVES   THE Carpenter Bee, who lived in the big poplar by the brook, wasn't building a house for Mrs. Ladybug. That skillful woodworker hadn't been able to agree with her--so he told Buster Bumblebee. Furthermore, he knew nothing of Mrs. Ladybug's present plans as to where she was going to spend the winter.  Nor did anybody else. It was all a great mystery. And Mrs. Ladybug seemed to enjoy it far more than her neighbors did. She was the only person that could have solved it for them. And she wouldn't.  At the same time she took delight in talking about her winter quarters, as she called the place where she intended to live during cold weather.  \"It will be cozy and warm there,\" she often remarked to her callers, of whom she had huge numbers. For there was scarcely a person in the orchard or the garden that didn't burn with curiosity to know more about the fine, big house into which Mrs. Ladybug expected to move.  \"My winter quarters will be wind-proof,\" Mrs. Ladybug told them. And that speech set them all to guessing again.  Almost everybody said then that she was going to live underground.  \"I shall not feel a drop of rain--not even during the January thaw,\" Mrs. Ladybug went on.  And then everybody had to begin guessing all over again; for rain drops were sure to trickle into an underground house during a warm spell.  \"You're going to live in a pumpkin!\" cried Buster Bumblebee.  And all the neighbors--even Mrs. Ladybug--laughed when they heard that.  Buster knew of an old tune called \"The Bumblebee in the Pumpkin,\" and he cried with some heat that he could think of no reason why there shouldn't be \"A Ladybug in a Pumpkin.\"  \"I told you my house was big--the biggest one on the farm,\" Mrs. Ladybug reminded him.  \"Ah!\" Chirpy Cricket exclaimed. \"Now I know! You're going to live in the haystack. A haystack is cozy and warm; it's wind-proof; it sheds water; and there's nothing bigger anywhere.\"  It really seemed as if Chirpy Cricket had solved the great mystery.  \"He's guessed the riddle!\" people said. \"You might as well admit now, Mrs. Ladybug, that you're going to spend the winter in Farmer Green's haystack.\"  But Mrs. Ladybug dashed their hopes.  \"You're wrong,\" she told her friends. \"And if to-night's as nippy as last night was, perhaps you'll find out to-morrow where I'm going. For I don't care to freeze my toes here in the orchard.\"  That night it was colder than ever. And the next day Mrs. Ladybug went all around the orchard and the garden bidding people good-by.  Still she wouldn't tell where she was going. And if Daddy Longlegs hadn't happened to stroll around the cherry tree outside Farmer Green's chamber window that afternoon, nobody would have known where Mrs. Ladybug went. But Daddy Longlegs saw her. And he hastened to spread the news.  \"Mrs. Ladybug has gone to spend the winter in the farmhouse!\"     XXIII  BACK AGAIN   SOMEHOW Mrs. Ladybug's friends missed her. The orchard seemed quite a different place after she vanished inside the farmhouse to stay there all winter long. In spite of her sharp tongue and her prying ways people discovered--now that she was gone--that they had liked Mrs. Ladybug more than they knew.  While she was with them in the orchard they had often wished she wouldn't ask so many questions. But now the days seemed very long without Mrs. Ladybug to inquire _how_ and _why_ and _when_ and _where_.  And then--then a rumor flashed from lip to lip all the way across the garden and the orchard and the meadow: \"Mrs. Ladybug is back again! She didn't stay in the farmhouse a week.\"  And sure enough! the rumor proved to be true. Mrs. Ladybug, looking rather foolish, appeared in her old haunts among the apple trees. She acted as if something had occurred to upset her. And though she seemed glad to be greeted by all her old companions, she didn't want them to ask her a single question as to why she hadn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20097"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Ladybug (#7)"],["body"," the whole winter, instead of only a few days of early fall, in Farmer Green's house.  If she thought her neighbors weren't going to question her she was sadly mistaken.  Only a little while before they had asked her a thousand and one questions about _where_ she was going to live during the winter. And now they were all just as curious to know why she had returned. But this time they asked her a thousand and two questions.  You couldn't say that her answers weren't satisfying, because she didn't make any answers at all.  Of course, things couldn't go on like that forever. People _had_ to know what had changed Mrs. Ladybug's plans. And in order to persuade the stubborn lady to explain matters, a few of her friends hinted that they expected they would have to go to Farmer Green himself and learn the truth.  \"You may ask him if you wish,\" Mrs. Ladybug told them. \"But it won't do you any good. He can't tell you what happened because he doesn't know himself.\"  \"Maybe the farmhouse was cold,\" Chirpy Cricket suggested.  Mrs. Ladybug made no comment on that remark.  \"Perhaps the roof leaked,\" said Daddy Longlegs.  Still no sign from Mrs. Ladybug.  \"She found that the farmhouse wasn't wind-proof,\" said Daddy Longlegs' wife.  And Mrs. Ladybug didn't deny it; nor did she say that that was so.  Then Buster Bumblebee made one of his blundering speeches.  \"It was a short winter, anyhow,\" he said.  Mrs. Ladybug's neighbors couldn't help tittering. And somehow their amusement stung her into telling the truth about the whole affair, right then and there.  \"Mrs. Green and I didn't get on well together,\" she confessed.     XXIV  MRS. GREEN'S MISTAKE   MRS. LADYBUG spoke at last. Her listeners crowded close about her, jostling one another in their eagerness to hear every word she said. For Mrs. Ladybug was recounting her adventures at the farmhouse.  \"I flew in through an open window,\" Mrs. Ladybug began. And she heaved a deep sigh, as if the telling of the tale was costing her much pain.  \"I said nothing to anybody,\" she explained, \"because I didn't wish to trouble the family. I knew I could find my way about the house after a little. And it wasn't long before I had discovered the stairway.  \"I didn't walk on the stairs for fear there might be mud on my feet,\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I didn't walk, but flew up to the second floor and went into the first chamber I saw. There was a fine, big closet off that room. The door leading into it was ajar; so I had no trouble slipping inside it. And there, high up on a broad shelf, I picked out the very spot where I could have spent the winter with every comfort in the world.\"  At this point Mrs. Ladybug was overcome by her feelings for a few moments. But the company waited politely until she could go on with her story.  She soon continued.  \"All went well--\" said Mrs. Ladybug--\"all went well until one day--this morning, to be exact--Mrs. Green opened the closet door and began to brush and sweep and wipe and dust. I heard her say that she was doing her fall cleaning. And of course that pleased me; for I was glad to learn that she was a neat housekeeper.  \"And then--\" here Mrs. Ladybug's voice broke slightly--\"and then, the first thing I knew she spied me and cried 'Ah, ha! A Carpet Bug!'  \"The next instant she whisked me off the shelf with a brush. Of course I played dead the moment she touched me. And I fell into the dustpan and never so much as wriggled a toe.  \"Soon afterward Mrs. Green set the dustpan beside the window which she had already opened. That was my chance. I seized it. I flew out of the window. And here I am.\"  Mrs. Ladybug's listeners shook their heads in sympathy.  \"You had a narrow escape,\" they told her. \"It's a wonder you got away.\"  \"Yes!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"And I'm glad now that that window was open. But for a moment I didn't much care what became of me. To think that anybody should mistake me for a Carpet Bug! Mrs. Green ought to know that the Carpet Bug family are covered with black, white and red scales. Ugh!\"  Mrs. Ladybug shuddered. She was smooth and shiny herself. So it wasn't strange that she should have felt insulted.  \"Anyhow,\" she added, \"Mrs. Green is the loser. Toward spring I would have kept her house plants free from insects. But now, of course, she'll have to do that herself.\"  \"Well,\" said the neighbors (or words to this effect), \"we're glad to see you again. And now--tell us!--where do you expect to spend the winter?\"  \"I'll let you decide that,\" Mrs. Ladybug replied.

Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.           For Children 6 to 12 Years  This series presents early American history in a manner that impresses the young readers. George and Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the famous General Washington, follow in play, the life of the great American.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS  Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in \"punishment\" lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the \"Life of Washington.\" The culprits listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further games of Indian warfare and Colonists battles.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' RELATIVES  The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games of playing George Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim almost loses his scalp.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' TRAVELS  The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons vanquish the Hessians on a battle-field in the empty lot back of the Davis property.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL  After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies camping near their homes and incidentally they recover a stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from a farmer.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' HOLIDAYS  They spend a pleasant summer on adjoining farms in Vermont. During a voyage they try to capture a \"frigate\" but little Jim is caught and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates save him.  THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS; FARMERS  Nero, the donkey, had never heard of George Washington, and so the game the children had planned after reading the story of the General's life on his farm turned out to be quite a different game altogether.
