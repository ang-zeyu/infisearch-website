Poetically it was the superior of any lyric work, except perhaps those of Metastasio. Musically it was radically different in character from the opera, as it was from the liturgical drama. But none the less it contained some of the germs of the modern opera. It had its solo, its chorus and its ballet.[12] But while the characters of these were almost as clearly defined as they are in Gluck's \"Orfeo,\" their musical basis, as we shall see, was altogether different. Nevertheless it was distinctly lyric and secular and was therefore as near the spirit of the popular music of the time as any new attempt could well approach. It had, too, in embryonic form all that apparatus for the enchantment of the sense and the beguilement of the intellect which in the following century was the chief attraction of a lyric drama, partly opera, partly spectacle and partly ballet.      [Footnote 12: George Hogarth, in his \"Memoirs of the Musical     Drama,\" London, 1838, declares that this \"Orfeo\" was sung     throughout, but he offers no ground for his assertion, which must     be taken as a mere conjecture based on the character of the text.     Dr. Burney, in his \"General History of Music,\" makes a similar     assertion, but does not support it.]     CHAPTER V  Poliziano's \"Favola Di Orfeo\"   In the year 1472 the Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, who had stayed long in Bologna, returned to Mantua. He was received with jubilant celebrations. There were banquets, processions and public rejoicings. It would have been quite unusual if there had been no festival play of some kind. It is uncertain whether Poliziano's \"Orfeo\" was written for this occasion, but there seems to be a fair amount of reason for believing that it was. At any rate it could not have been produced later than 1483, for we know it was made in honor of this Cardinal and that he died in that year.  If the \"Orfeo\" was played in 1472 it must have been written when its author was no more than eighteen years of age. But even at that age he was already famous. He was born in Montepulciano on July 14, 1454. The family name was Ambrogini, but from the Latinized name of his native town turned into Italian he constructed the title of Poliziano, by which he was afterward known. At the age of ten he was sent to Florence, then governed by Lorenzo de Medici. He studied under the famous Greeks Argyropoulos and Kallistos and the equally famous Italians, Landino and Ficino.[13] Gifted with precocious talent, he wrote at the age of sixteen, astonishing epigrams in Latin and Greek. At seventeen he began to translate the \"Iliad\" into Latin hexameters, and his success with the second book attracted the attention of Lorenzo himself. Poliziano was now known as the \"Homeric youth.\" It was not long before he was hailed the king of Italian scholars and the literary genius of his time. When he was but thirty he became professor of Greek and Latin in the University of Florence, and drew to his feet students from all parts of Europe. John Reuchlin hastened from Germany, William Grocyn from the shades of Oxford, and from the same seat of learning the mighty Thomas Linacre, later to found the Royal College of Physicians. Lorenzo's sons, Piero and Giovanni, were for a time his pupils, but their mother took them away. Poliziano was as vicious as the typical men of his time and the prudent Clarice knew it.      [Footnote 13: John Argyropoulos, who was born at Constantinople in     1416, was one of the first teachers of Greek in Italy, where he     was long a guest of Palla degli Strozzi at Padua. In 1456 he went     to Florence, where Cosimo de Medici's son and grandson were among     his pupils. He spent fifteen years in Florence and thence went to     Rome. To this master, George Gemistos and George Trapezuntios, the     acquisition of Greek knowledge at Florence in the fifteenth     century was chiefly due. It should be particularly noted that all     of them went to Italy before the fall of the Greek empire in 1453.     Andronicus Kallistos was one of the popular lecturers of the time     and one of the first Greeks to visit France. Cristoforo Landino,     one of the famous coterie of intellectual men associated with     Lorenzo de Medici, took the chair of rhetoric and poetry at     Florence in 1454. He paid especial attention in his lectures to     the Italian poets, and in 1481 published an edition of Dante. His     famous \"Camaldolese Discussions,\" modeled in part on Cicero's     \"Tusculan Disputations,\" is well known to students of Italian     literature. Marsilio Ficino was a philosopher, and his chief aim     was a reconciliation of ancient philosophy with Christianity.]  Dwelling in a villa at Fiesole, provided for him by Lorenzo, Poliziano occupied his life with teaching and writing, occasionally paying visits to other cities. In 1492 Lorenzo passed away and Poliliziano wrote an elegy which is to this day regarded as unique in modern Latin verse. In 1494 the famous scholar followed his patron, even while Savonarola was setting Italy in a ferment of passionate religious reaction against the poetic and sensuous paganism infused into the thought of their time by Poliziano and Lorenzo. The scholar was laid in San Marco and they set upon his tomb this epitaph: \"Here lies the angel who had one head, and what is new, three tongues.\"  This is not the place for a discussion of Poliziano's importance in literature, but it is essential that we should understand the significance of his achievement in the \"Orfeo.\" The philosophic and poetic spirit of the period and of this poem has already been discussed. But we may not dismiss the subject without noting that Poliziano powerfully forwarded the impulse toward the employment of Italian as a literary vehicle. Too many of the Italian humanists had preferred Latin, and had looked down upon the native language as uncouth and fit only for the masses. But when the authority of Poliziano was thrown upon the side of Italian and when he made such a triumphant demonstration of its beauties in his \"Stanze\" and his \"Orfeo,\" he carried conviction to all the writers of his country.  According to Poliziano's own statement he wrote the \"Orfeo\" at the request of the Cardinal of Mantua in the space of two days, \"among continual disturbances, and in the vulgar tongue, that it might be the better comprehended by the spectators.\" It was his opinion that this creation would bring him more shame than honor. There are only 434 lines in the \"Orfeo\" and therefore the feat of writing it in two days was no great one for a man of Poliziano's ability.  Sismondi[14] regards this work as an eclogue rather than a drama. He says: \"The universal homage paid to Virgil had a decided influence on the rising drama. The scholars were persuaded that this cherished poet combined in himself all the different kinds of excellence; and as they created a drama before they possessed a theater, they imagined that dialogue rather than action, was the essence of the dramatic art. The Buccolics appeared to them a species of comedies or tragedies, less animated it is true, but more poetical than the dramas of Terence and of Seneca, or perhaps of the Greeks. They attempted indeed to unite these two kinds, to give interest by action to the tranquil reveries of the shepherds, and to preserve a pastoral charm in the more violent expression of passion. The Orpheus, though divided into five acts, though mingled with chorus, and terminating with a tragic incident, is still an eclogue rather than a drama.\"      [Footnote 14: \"Historical View of the Literature of the South of     Europe,\" by J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi, translated by Thomas     Roscoe. London, 1895.]  Sismondi's perception of the survival of the pastoral character in this new form of entertainment is something we can appreciate, for this character has survived all the experiments made on the \"Orfeo\" legend and it dominates even the epoch-making work of Gluck.  Symonds, who had a broader view of art than Sismondi, had no difficulty in perceiving that the true genius of this new drama was lyric. He says: \"To do the 'Orfeo' justice we ought to have heard it with its own accompaniment of music.\" He enlarges upon the failure of the author to seize the opportunity to make much of the really tragic moment in the play, namely that expressing the frenzied grief of Orfeo over the loss of Euridice. Yet, he notes, \"when we return from these criticisms to the real merit of the piece, we find in it a charm of musical language, a subtlety of musical movement, which are irresistibly fascinating. Thought and feeling seem alike refined to a limpidity that suits the flow of melody in song. The very words evaporate and lose themselves in floods of sound.\" Surely, here is the description of an ideal opera book.  Two editions of the play are known and both are published in a volume edited by Carducci.[15] The first version is that originally printed in 1494 and reprinted frequently up to 1776. In the latter year the second version was brought out by Padre Ireneo Affo at Venice. This was in all probability a revision of the poem by Poliziano. In this version the division into five acts is noted and there are additional poetic passages of great beauty. It may be worth a note in passing that in 1558 a version of the \"Orfeo\" in octave stanzas was published for the use of the common people and that as late as 1860 it continued to be printed from time to time for the use of the Tuscan contadini.      [Footnote 15: \"Le Stanze, l'Orfeo e le Rime di Messer Angelo     Abrogini Poliziano,\" per Giosue Carducci. Firenze, 1863.]  The main movement of Poliziano's poem is intrusted to the traditional octave stanza, but we find passages of terza rima. There are also choral passages which suggest the existence of the frottola, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19958"],["title","Some Forerunners of Italian Opera (#7)"],["body","song and the ballata. The play is introduced by Mercury acting as prologue. This was in accordance with time honored custom which called for an \"announcer of the festival.\" The first scene is between Mopsus, an old shepherd, and Aristæus, a young one. Aristæus, after the manner of shepherds, has seen a nymph, and has become desperately enamored. Mopsus shakes his head and bids the young man beware. Aristæus says that his nymph loves melody. He urges Mopsus:    \"Forth from thy wallet take thy pipe and we   Will sing awhile beneath the leafy trees;   For well my nymph is pleased with melody.\"  Now follows a number which the author calls a \"canzona\"--song. The first stanza of the Italian text will serve to show the form.      \"Udite, selve, mie dolce parole,       Poi che la ninfa mia udir non vole.     La bella ninfa e sorda al mio lamento       E'l suon di nostra fistula non cura:   Di cio si lagna il mio cornuto armento,     Ne vuol bagnare il grifo in acqua pura     Ne vuol toccar la tenera verdura;         Tanto del suo pastor gl'incresce e dole.\"  The two introductory lines preface each stanza. This first one is thus translated by Symonds,[16] whose English version is here used throughout.    \"Listen, ye wild woods, to my roundelay;     Since the fair nymph will hear not, though I pray.      The lovely nymph is deaf to my lament,     Nor heeds the music of this rustic reed;   Wherefore my flocks and herds are ill content,       Nor bathe the hoof where grows the water weed,       Nor touch the tender herbage on the mead;   So sad because their shepherd grieves are they.\"      [Footnote 16: In \"Sketches and Studies in Italy,\" pp. 217-224.]  There are four stanzas. The nymph who has bewitched Aristæus is Euridice and the second scene shows us the shepherd pursuing her. It appears that in trying to escape from the shepherd she was bitten by a deadly snake, for in the third scene a dryad tells the story of the tragedy to her sisters. In the first edition, \"dei codici chigiano e Riccardiano,\" the next scene introduces Orpheus, who sings a song with Latin text beginning thus:  \"O meos longum modulata lusus   Quos amor primam docuit juventam,     Flecte nunc mecum numeros novumque       Dic, lyra, carmen.\"  The most significant matter connected with this scene in the early version of the poem is the stage direction, which reads thus: \"Orfeo cantando sopra il monte in su la lira e seguente versi latini fu interotto da un pastore nunciatore della morte di Euridice.\" The name of the actor of Orfeo is mentioned as Baccio Ugolino. This stage \"business\" in English reads: \"Orpheus singing on the hill to his lyre the following Latin verses is interrupted by a shepherd announcing the death of Euridice.\" Thirteen verses of the song are given before the entrance of the shepherd, and immediately after the announcement Orpheus descends into Hades. In the Padre Affo's later version of the work this song of Orpheus does not appear, but a dryad announces to her sisters the death of Euridice and then follows a chorus:    \"L'Aria di pianti s'oda risuonare,       Che d' ogni luce e priva:       E al nostro lagrimare       Crescano i fiumi al colmo della riva--\"  The refrain, \"l'aria di pianti\" is repeated at the end of each stanza. At the conclusion of this chorus the dryads leave the stage. Orpheus enters singing a Latin stanza of four lines beginning:    \"Musa, triumphales titulos et gesta canamus     Herculis.\"  In Padre Affo's edition it is at this point that a dryad tells Orpheus of Euridice's death. Mnesillus, a satyr, mocks him. The hero now sings in the vernacular:      \"Ora piangiamo, O sconsolata lyra,\" etc.   \"Let us lament, O lyre disconsolate:     Our wonted music is in tune no more.\"  The story now moves similarly in both editions. Orpheus determines to descend to Hades to try to move the infernal powers \"with tearful songs and words of honey'd woe.\" He remembers that he has moved stones and turned the flowing streams. He proceeds at once to the iron gates and raises his song. Pluto demands to know    \"What man is he who with his golden lyre   Hath moved the gates that never move,   While the dead folk repeat his dirge of love.\"  These words leave no doubt that Orpheus sang. Even Proserpine, the spouse of Pluto, confesses to her lord that she feels the new stirrings of sympathy. She desires to hear more of this wondrous song. Now Orpheus sings in octave stanzas. The last stanza of his song is thus translated by Symonds:    \"I pray not to you by the waves forlorn   Of marshy Styx or dismal Acheron,   By Chaos, where the mighty world was born,   Or by the sounding flames of Phlegethon;   But by the fruit that charmed thee on that morn   When thou didst leave our world for this dread throne!   O queen, if thou reject this pleading breath,   I will no more return, but ask for death.\"  Pluto yields up Euridice according to the well-known condition that Orpheus keep silence and look not back till out of Hades. The poet again sings four Latin lines and with his bride starts for the upper world. The catastrophe is treated in much the same manner as it has been in subsequent versions of the story. Euridice disappears. Orpheus is about to turn back, but he is stopped by Tisiphone. He then breaks into virulent raillery, swears he'll never love woman more and advises all husbands to seek divorce. All this is in resounding octave rime. Then a Mænad calls upon her sisters to defend their sex. They drive Orpheus off the stage and slay him. Returning they sing a chorus, which is the finale of the opera.      \"Ciascun segua, O Bacco, te;         Bacco, Bacco, oé, oé!   Di corimbi e di verd'edere     Cinto il capo abbiam cosi     Per servirti a tuo richiedere     Festiggiando notte e di.     Ognun breva: Bacco e qui:     E lasciate bere a me.   Ciascun segua, O Bacco, te.\"  This chorus is translated by Symonds. The first stanza, above given in the original Italian, is translated thus:    \"Bacchus! we must all follow thee!     Bacchus! Bacchus! Ohe! Ohe!    With ivy coronals, bunch and berry,     Crown we our heads to worship thee!   Thou hast bidden us to make merry     Day and night with jollity!   Drink then! Bacchus is here! Drink free,   And hand ye the drinking cup to me!       Bacchus! Bacchus! we must all follow thee!       Bacchus! Bacchus! Ohe! Ohe!\"  This is a sketch of the poem of Poliziano, on a story which became the subject of many operas, down to the time of Gluck. This is the story set by Monteverde in his famous work, which has recently been revived in Italy with success. This story was utilized by Peri and Caccini in their \"Euridice,\" which is accepted as the first opera written in the new representative style of the sixteenth century to receive a public performance.  But, as we have already noted, in this \"Orfeo,\" performed at the Mantuan court, there was so much of the material of a genuine lyric drama that it now becomes our business to examine more closely the character of the musical features and the manner of the performance. The points at which music must have been heard are clearly indicated by the text. Before proceeding to a consideration of this music, let us picture to ourselves how the work was performed.     CHAPTER VI  The Performance of \"Orfeo\"   The \"Orfeo\" was performed in a hall of the castle. The lyric dramas of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were all presented in private. There were no opera houses, and the theater, though revived in Italy in the fifteenth century, had no permanency till Alfonso I, Duke of Ferrara, at the suggestion of Ariosto built in his capital a real play house. There is nevertheless no reason to think that the performance of Poliziano's \"Orfeo\" lacked admirable scenic and histrionic features. We have already seen how skilful the Italian managers and mechanicians of spectacular sacred plays were in preparing brilliant scenic effects for their productions. Since the form and general apparatus of the sacred play were seized by Poliziano for the fashioning of his \"Orfeo,\" it is altogether probable that he accepted from the earlier creation pregnant suggestions as to the manner of presentation.  However, as the \"Orfeo\" was to be given indoors the manner of exhibiting it had to differ somewhat from that of the open air spectacle. The scale of the picture had to be reduced and the use of large movement relinquished. A temporary stage was erected in the great hall of the Palazzo Gonzaga. A single setting sufficed for the pictorial investiture of the action. The stage was divided into two parts. One side represented the Thracian country, with its streams and mountains and its browsing flocks. The other represented the inferno with Pluto, Proserpine, and the other personages made familiar by classic literature. Between the two was a partition and at the rear of the inferno were the iron gates.[17]      [Footnote 17: \"Florentia: Uomini e cose del Quattrocento,\" by     Isidore del Lungo.]  One easily realizes the vivid potency of the picture when Baccio Ugolino, as Orpheus, clad in a flowing robe of white, with a fillet around his head, a \"golden\" lyre in one hand and the \"plectrum\" in the other, appeared at the iron gates, and, striking the strings of the sweet sounding instrument, assailed the stony hearts of the infernals with song as chaste and yet as persuasive as that of Gluck himself. It is no difficult task to conjure up the scene, to see the gorgeously clad courtiers and ladies bending forward in their seats and hanging upon the accents of this gifted and accomplished performer of their day.  Of the history of Baccio Ugolino little, if anything, is known. There was a Ugolino of Orvieto, who flourished about the beginning of the fifteenth century. He was archpriest of Ferrara, and appears to have written a theoretical work on music in which he set forth a great deal of the fundamental matter afterward utilized in the writings of Tinctoris.
