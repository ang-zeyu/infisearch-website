You'd think it was horses.\"  \"... the center table looks loaded and ready to start half the time ... but I can't help it, with the children's books and truck.\"  \"... never would have another house built without a coat closet. The children's cloaks and caps and rubbers litter up everything.\"  \"... every one of their knees out, and their underclothes outgrown, and their waists soiled, the whole time. And I do try so hard....\"  Now with all these bewilderments she was to have to do. She wondered if she would know how to dress him. Once she had watched Mis' Winslow dress a child, and she remembered what unexpected places Mis' Winslow had buttoned--buttonholes that went _up and down_ in the skirt bands, and so on. Armholes might be too small and garters too tight, and how was one ever to know? If it were a little girl now ... but a little boy.... What would she talk to him about while they ate together?  [Illustration: \"HE STOOD LOOKING AT IT FROM PART WAY ACROSS THE ROAD\"]  She lay in the dark and planned--with no pleasure, but merely because she always planned everything, her dress, her baking, what she would say to this one and that. She would put up a stove in the back parlour, and give him the room \"off.\" She was glad that the parlour was empty and clean--\"no knick-knacks for a boy to knock around,\" she found herself thinking. And a child would like the bedroom wallpaper, with the owl border. When Summer came he could have the room over the dining room, with the kitchen roof sloping away from it where he could dry his hazelnuts--she had thought of the pasture hazelnuts, first thing. There were a good many things a boy would like about the place: the bird house where the martins always built, the hens, the big hollow tree, the pasture ant hill.... She would have to find out the things he liked to eat. She would have to help him with his lessons--she could do that for only a little while, until he would be too old to need her. Then maybe there would come the time when he would ask her things that she would not know....  She fell asleep wondering how he would look. Already, not from any impatience to have this done, but because that was the way in which she worked, she had his room in order; and her picture of his father was by the mirror, the young face of his father. Something faded had been written below the picture, and this she had painstakingly rubbed away before she set the picture in its place. Next day, while she was working on Mis' Jane Moran's bead basque that was to be cut over and turned, she laid it aside and cut out a jacket pattern, and a plaited waist pattern--just to see if she could. These she rolled up impatiently and stuffed away in her pattern bookcase.  \"I knew how to do them all the while, and I never knew I knew,\" she thought with annoyed surprise. \"I s'pose I'll waste a lot of time pottering over him.\"  It was so that she spent the weeks until the letter came telling her what day the child would start. On the afternoon of the day the letter came, she went down town to the Amos Ames Emporium to buy a washbasin and pitcher for the room she meant the little boy to have. She stood looking at a basin with a row of brown dogs around the rim, when over her shoulder Mis' Abby Winslow spoke.  \"You ain't buying a Christmas present for anybody, are you?\" she asked warningly.  Mary started guiltily and denied it.  \"Well, what in time do you want with dogs on the basin?\" Mis' Winslow demanded.  Almost against her own wish, Mary told her. Mis' Winslow was one of those whose faces are invariable forerunners of the sort of thing they are going to say. With eyebrows, eyes, forehead, head, and voice she took the news.  \"He is! Forever and ever more. When's he going to get here?\"  \"Week after next,\" Mary said listlessly. \"It's an awful responsibility, ain't it--taking a child so?\"  Mis' Winslow's face abruptly rejected its own anxious lines and let the eyes speak for it.  \"I always think children is like air,\" she said; \"you never realize how hard they're pressing down on you--but you do know you can't live without them.\"  Mary looked at her, her own face not lighting.  \"I'd rather go along like I am,\" she said; \"I'm used to myself the way I am.\"  \"Mary Chavah!\" said Mis' Winslow, sharply, \"a vegetable sprouts. Can't you? Is these stocking caps made so's they won't ravel?\" she inquired capably of Abel Ames. \"These are real good value, Mary,\" she added kindly. \"Better su'prise the little thing with one of these. A red one.\"  Mary counted over her money, and bought the red stocking cap and the basin with the puppies. Then she went into the street. The sense of oppression, of striving, that had seldom left her since that night in the stable, made the day a thing to be borne, to be breasted. The air was thick with snow, and in the whiteness the dreary familiarity of the drug store, the meat market, the post office, the Simeon Buck Dry Goods Exchange, smote her with a passion to escape from them all, to breed new familiars, to get free of the thing that she had said she would do.  \"And I could,\" she thought; \"I could telegraph to John not to send him. But Jenny--she can't. I don't see how she stands it....\"  The thought may have been why, instead of going home, she went to see Jenny. A neighbor was in the sitting room with Mrs. Wing. Jenny met Mary at the kitchen door and stood against a background of clothes drying on lines stretched indoors.  \"Don't you want to come upstairs?\" Jenny said. \"There ain't a fire up there--but I can show you the things.\"  She had put them all in the bottom drawer, as women always do; and, as women always do, had laid them so that all the lace and embroidery and pink ribbons possible showed in a flutter when the drawer was opened. Jenny took the things out, one at a time, unfolded, discussed, compared, with all the tireless zeal of a robin with a straw in its mouth or of a tree, blossoming. \"Smell of them,\" Jenny bade her. \"Honestly, wouldn't you know by the smell who they are for?\" \"I donno but you would,\" Mary admitted awkwardly, and marveled dumbly at the newness Jenny was feeling in that which, after all, was not new!  When these things were all out, a little tissue-paper parcel was left lying in the drawer.  \"There's one more,\" Mary said.  Jenny flushed, hesitated, lifted it.  \"That's nothing,\" she said; \"before I came I made some little things for its Christmas. I thought maybe it would come first, and we'd have the Christmas in my room, and I made some little things--just for fun, you know. But it won't be fair to do it now, with the whole town so set against our having any Christmas. Mary, it just seems as though I had to have a Christmas this year!\"  \"Oh, well,\" said Mary, \"the baby'll be your Christmas. The town can't help that, I guess.\"  \"I know,\" Jenny flashed back brightly, \"you and I have got the best of them, haven't we? We've each got one present coming, anyway.\"  \"I s'pose we have....\" Mary said.  She looked at Jenny's Christmas things--a ribbon rattle, a crocheted cap, a first picture book, a cascade of colored rings--and then in grim humour at Jenny.  \"It'll never miss its Christmas,\" she said dryly.  \"Don't you think so?\" said Jenny, soberly. \"I donno. It seems as if it'd be kind o' lonesome to get born around Christmas and not find any going on.\"  She put the things away, and closed the drawer. For no appreciable reason, she kept it locked, and the key under the bureau cover.  \"Do you know yet when yours is coming?\" Jenny asked, as she rose.  \"Week after next,\" Mary repeated,--\"two weeks from last night,\" she confessed, \"if he comes straight through.\"  \"I think,\" said Jenny, \"I think mine will be here--before then.\"  When they reached the foot of the stair, Mary unexpectedly refused to go in the sitting room.  \"No,\" she said, \"I must be getting home. I just come out for a minute, anyway. I'm--I'm much obliged for what you showed me,\" she added, and hesitated. \"I've got his room fixed up real nice. There's owls on the wall paper and puppies on the washbasin,\" she said. \"Come in when you can and see it.\"  It was almost dusk when Mary reached home. While she was passing the billboard at the corner--a flare of yellow letters, as if Colour and the Alphabet had united to breed a monster--she heard children shouting. A block away, and across the street, coming home from Rolleston's hill where they had been coasting, were Bennet and Gussie Bates, little Emily, Tab Winslow, and Pep. Nearly every day of snow they passed her house. She always heard them talking, and usually she heard, across at the corner, the click of the penny-in-the-slot machine, which no child seemed able to pass without pulling. To-night, as she heard them coming, Mary fumbled in her purse. Three, four, five pennies she found and ran across the street and dropped them in the slot machine, and gained her own door before the children came. She stood at her dark threshold, and listened. She had not reckoned in vain. One of the children pushed down on the rod, in the child's eternal hope of magic, and when magic came and three, four, five chocolates dropped obediently in their hands, Mary listened to what they said. It was not much, and it was not very coherent, but it was wholly intelligible.  \"Look at!\" shrieked Bennet, who had made the magic.  \"_Did_ it?\" cried Gussie, and repeated the operation.  \"It--it--it never!\" said Tab Winslow, at the third.  \"Make it again--make it again!\" cried little Emily, and they did.  \"Gorry,\" observed Pep, in ecstasy.  When it would give no more, they divided with the other children and ran on, their red mittens and mufflers flaming in the snow. Mary stood staring after them for a moment, then she closed her door.  \"I wonder what made me do that,\" she thought.  In her dining room she mended the fire without taking off her hat. It was curious, she reflected;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],["title","Christmas: A Story (#7)"],["body","was this room looking the way it looked, and away off there was the little fellow who had never seen the room; and in a little while he would be calling this room home, and looking for his books and his mittens, and knowing it better than any other place in the world. And there was Jenny, with that bottom drawerful, and pretty soon somebody that now was not, would be, and would be wearing the drawerful and calling Jenny \"mother,\" and would know her better than any one else in the world. Mary could not imagine that little boy of Lily's getting used to her--Mary--and calling her--well, what would he call her? She hadn't thought of that....  \"Bother,\" thought Mary Chavah, \"there's going to be forty nuisances about it that I s'pose I haven't even thought of yet.\"  She stood by the window. She had not lighted the lamp, so the world showed white, not black. Snow makes outdoors look big, she thought. But it was big--what a long journey it was to Idaho. Suppose ... something happened to the man he was to travel with. John Blood was only a boy; he would probably put the child's name and her address in the little traveler's pocket, and these would be lost. The child was hardly old enough to remember what to do. He would go astray, and none of them would ever know what had become of him ... and what would become of him? She saw him and his bundle of clothes alone in the station in the City....  She turned from the window and mechanically mended the fire again. She drew down the window shade and went to the coat closet to hang away her wraps. Then abruptly she took up her purse, counted out the money in the firelight, and went out the door and down the street in the dusk, and into the post office, which was also the telegraph office,--one which the little town owed to Ebenezer Rule, and it a rival to the other telegraph office at the station.  \"How much does it cost to send a telegram?\" she demanded. \"Idaho,\" she answered the man's question, flushing at her omission.  While the man, Affer by name, laboriously looked it up,--covering incredible little dirty figures with an incredibly big dirty forefinger,--Mary stood staring at the list of names tacked below the dog-eared Christmas Notice. She remembered that she had not yet signed it herself. She asked for a pencil--causing confusion to the little figures and delay to the big finger--and, while she waited, wrote her name. \"A good, sensible move,\" she thought, as she signed.  When Affer gave her the rate, thrusting finger and figures jointly beneath the bars,--solicitous of his own accuracy,--Mary filed her message. It was to John Blood, and it read:----  \"Be sure you tie his tag on him good.\"     VII   Ebenezer Rule had meant to go to the City before cold weather came. He had there a small and decent steam-warmed flat where he boiled his own eggs and made his own coffee, read his newspapers and kept his counsel, descending nightly to the ground-floor café to dine on ambiguous dishes at tables of other bank swallows who nested in the same cliff. But as the days went by, he found himself staying on in Old Trail Town, with this excuse and that, offered by himself to himself. As, for example, that in the factory there were old account books that he must go through. And having put off this task from day to day and finding at last nothing more to dally with, he set out one morning for the ancient building down in that part of the village which was older than the rest and was where his business was conducted when it was conducted.  It had snowed in the night, and Buff Miles, who drove the village snowplow, was also driver of \"the 'bus.\" So on the morning after a snowfall, the streets always lay buried thick until after the 8.10 Express came in; and since on the morning following a snowfall the 8.10 Express was always late, Old Trail Town lay locked in a kind of circular argument, and everybody stayed indoors or stepped high through drifts. The direct way to the factory was virtually untrodden, and Ebenezer made a detour through the business street in search of some semblance of a \"track.\"  The light of a Winter morning is not kind, only just. It is just to the sky and discovers it to be dominant; to trees, and their lines are seen to be alive, like leaves; to folk, and no disguise avails. Summer gives complements and accessories to the good things in a human face. Winter affords nothing save disclosure. In the uncompromising cleanness of that wash of Winter light, Ebenezer Rule was himself, for anybody to see. Looking like countless other men, lean, alert, preoccupied, his tall figure stooped, his smooth, pale face like a photograph too much retouched, this commonplace man took his place in the day almost as one of its externals. With that glorious pioneer trio, mineral, vegetable and animal; and with intellect, that worthy tool, he did his day's work. His face was one that had never asked itself, say, of a Winter morning: _What else?_ And the Winter light searched him pitilessly to find that question somewhere in him.  Before the Simeon Buck North American Dry Goods Exchange, Simeon Buck himself had just finished shoveling his walk, and stood wiping his snow shovel with an end of his muffler. When he saw Ebenezer, he shook the muffler at him, and then, over his left shoulder, jabbed the air with his thumb.  \"Look at here,\" he said, his head reënforcing his gesture toward his show window, \"look what I done this morning. Nice little touch--eh?\"  In the show window of the Exchange--Dry Goods Exchange was just the name of it for the store carried everything--a hodgepodge of canned goods, lace curtains, kitchen utensils, wax figures, and bird cages had been ranged round a center table of golden oak. On the table stood a figure that was as familiar to Old Trail Town as was its fire engine and its sprinkling cart. Like these, appearing intermittently, the figure had seized on the imagination of the children and grown in association until it belonged to everybody, by sheer use and wont. It was a _papier-mâché_ Santa Claus, three feet high, white-bearded, gray-gowned, with tall pointed cap--rather the more sober Saint Nicholas of earlier days than the rollicking, red-garbed Saint Nick of now. Only, whereas for years he had graced the window of the Exchange, bearing over his shoulder a little bough of green for a Christmas tree, this season he stood treeless, and instead bore on his shoulder a United States flag. On a placard below him Simeon had laboriously lettered:--      High Cost of Living     and too much fuss     Makes Folks want a     Sane Christmas     Me Too.   S. C.  \"Ain't that neat?\" said Simeon.  Ebenezer looked. \"What's the flag for?\" he inquired dryly.  \"Well,\" said Simeon, \"he had to carry something. I thought of a toy gun--but that didn't seem real appropriate. A Japanese umbrella wasn't exactly in season, seems though. A flag was about the only thing I could think of to have him hold. A flag is always kind of tasty, don't you think?\"  \"Oh, it's harmless,\" Ebenezer said, \"harmless.\"  \"No hustling business,\" Simeon pursued, \"can be contented with just _not_ doing something. It ain't enough not to have no Christmas. You've got to find something that'll express nothing, and express it forcible. In business, a minus sign,\" said Simeon, \"is as good as a plus, if you can keep it whirling round and round.\"  This Ebenezer mulled and chuckled over as he went on down the street. He wondered what the Emporium would do to keep up with the Exchange. But in the Emporium window there was nothing save the usual mill-end display for the winter white goods sale.  Ebenezer opened the store door and put his head in.  \"Hey,\" he shouted at Abel, back at the desk, \"can't you keep up with Simeon's window?\"  Abel came down the aisle between the lengths of white stuff plaited into folds at either side. The fire had just been kindled in the stove, and the air in the store was still frosty. Abel, in his overcoat, was blowing on his fingers.  \"I ain't much of any heart to,\" said he, \"but the night before Christmas I guess'll do about right for mine.\"  \"What'll you put up?\" Ebenezer asked, closing the door behind him.  \"Well, sir,\" said Abel, \"I ain't made up my mind full yet. But I'll be billblowed if I'm going to let Christmas go by without saying something about it in the window.\"  \"Night before Christmas'll be too late to advertise anything,\" said Ebenezer. \"If I was in trade,\" he said, half closing his eyes, \"I'd fill my window up with useful articles--caps and mittens and stockings and warm underwear and dishes and toothbrushes. And I'd say: 'Might as well afford these on what you saved out of Christmas.' You'd ought to get all the advertising you can out of any situation.\"  Abel shook his head.  \"I ain't much on such,\" he said lightly--and then looked intently at Ebenezer. \"Jenny's been buying quite a lot here for her Christmas,\" he said.  Ebenezer was blank. \"Jenny?\" he said. \"Jenny Wing? I heard she was here. I ain't seen her. Is she bound to keep Christmas anyhow?\"  \"Just white goods, it was,\" said Abel, briefly.  Ebenezer frowned his lack of understanding.  \"I shouldn't think her and Bruce had much of anything to buy anything with,\" he said. \"I s'pose you know,\" he added, \"that Bruce, the young beggar, quit working for me in the City after the--the failure? Threw up his job with me, and took God knows what to do.\"  Abel nodded gravely. All Old Trail Town knew that, and honoured Bruce for it.  \"Headstrong couple,\" Ebenezer added. \"So Jenny's bent on having Christmas, no matter what the town decides, is she?\" he added, \"it's like her, the minx.\"  \"I don't think it was planned that way,\" Abel said simply; \"she's only buying white goods,\" he repeated. And, Ebenezer still staring, \"Surely you know what Jenny's come home for?\" Abel said.  A moment or two later Ebenezer was out on the street again, his face turned toward the factory. He was aware that Abel caught open the door behind him and "]]]
