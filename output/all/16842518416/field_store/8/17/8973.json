Their completeness of abstraction from the accidents of experience, from the differences, qualifications, variations which contribute so largely to the personal interests of life, this it is which makes the abstract sciences demonstrative, exact, and universally applicable.  In so far, therefore, as we are permitted to grasp the conception of a perfectly abstract existence prior to, and underlying, and enclosing, all separate existences, so far also do we get to a conception which is demonstrative, exact, and universally applicable throughout the whole world of knowable objects.  Such a conception, however, by its absolute emptiness of content, does not afford any means in itself of progression; somehow and somewhere a principle of movement, of development, of concrete reality, must be found or assumed, to link this ultimate abstraction of existence to the multifarious phenomena {12} of existence as known.  And it was, perhaps, because Anaximander failed to work out this aspect of the question, that in the subsequent leaders of the school _movement_, rather than mere existence, was the principle chiefly insisted upon.  Before passing, however, to these successors of Anaximander, some opinions of his which we have not perhaps the means of satisfactorily correlating with his general conception, but which are not without their individual interest, may here be noted.  [14] The word _husk_ or _bark_ ((Greek) _phloios_) seems to have been a favourite one with him, as implying and depicting a conception of interior and necessary development in things.  Thus he seems to have postulated an inherent tendency or law in the infinite, which compelled it to develop contrary characters, as hot and cold, dry and moist.  In consequence of this fundamental tendency an envelope of fire, he says, came into being, encircling another envelope of air, which latter in turn enveloped the sphere of earth, each being like the 'husk' of the other, or like the bark which encloses the tree.  This concentric system he conceives as having in some way been parted up into various systems, represented by the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth.  The last he figured as hanging in space, and deriving its stability from the inherent and perfect balance or relation of its parts.  {13}  [16]  Then, again, as to the origin of man, he seems to have in like manner taught a theory of development from lower forms of life.  In his view the first living creatures must have come into being in moisture (thus recalling the theory of Thales).  As time went on, and these forms of life reached their fuller possibilities, they came to be transferred to the dry land, casting off their old nature like a husk or bark.  More particularly he insists that man must have developed out of other and lower forms of life, because of his exceptional need, under present conditions, of care and nursing in his earlier years.  Had he come into being at once as a human creature he could never have survived.  The analogies of these theories with modern speculations are obvious and interesting.  But without enlarging on these, one has only to say in conclusion that, suggestive and interesting as many of these poor fragments, these _disjecti membra poetae_, are individually, they leave us more and more impressed with a sense of incompleteness in our knowledge of Anaximander's theory as a whole.  It may be that as a consistent and perfected system the theory never was worked out; it may be that it never was properly understood.    [1] By some authorities it is stated that Anaximander, the second philosopher of this school, was the first to use the word _arche_ in the philosophic sense.  Whether this be so or not, Thales certainly had the idea.     {14}  CHAPTER II  THE SCHOOL OF MILETUS (_concluded_)  _Air the beginning of things--All things pass--The eternal and the temporary--The weeping philosopher_   [17]  III. ANAXIMENES.--This philosopher was also a native of Miletus, and is said to have been a hearer or pupil of Anaximander.  As we have said, the [19] tendency of the later members of the school was towards emphasising the _motive_ side of the supposed underlying principle of nature, and accordingly Anaximenes chose Air as the element which best [18] represented or symbolised that principle.  Its fluidity, readiness of movement, wide extension, and absolute neutrality of character as regards colour, taste, smell, form, etc., were obvious suggestions. The breath also, whose very name to the ancients implied an identity with the life or soul, was nothing but air; and the identification of Air with Life supplied just that principle of productiveness and movement, which was felt [20] to be necessary in the primal element of being.  The process of existence, then, he conceived as consisting in a certain concentration of this diffused life-giving element into more or less solidified forms, and the {15} ultimate separation and expansion of these back into the formless air again.  The contrary forces previously used by Anaximander--heat and cold, drought and moisture--are with Anaximenes also the agencies which institute these changes.  This is pretty nearly all that we know of Anaximenes.  So far as the few known facts reveal him, we can hardly say that except as supplying a step towards the completer development of the _motive_ [22] idea in being, he greatly adds to the chain of progressive thought.  IV. HERACLITUS.--Although not a native of Miletus, but of Ephesus, Heraclitus, both by his nationality as an Ionian and by his position in the development of philosophic conceptions, falls naturally to be classed with the philosophers of Miletus.  His period may be given approximately as from about 560 to 500 B.C., though others place him a generation later.  Few authentic particulars have been preserved of him.  We hear of extensive travels, of his return to his native city only to refuse a share in its activities, of his retirement to a hermit's life.  He seems to have formed a contrast to the preceding philosophers in his greater detachment from the ordinary interests of civic existence; and much in his teaching suggests the ascetic if not the misanthrope.  He received the nickname of 'The Obscure,' from the studied mystery in which he was supposed to involve his {16} [23] teaching.  He wrote not for the vulgar, but for the gifted few.  'Much learning makes not wise' was the motto of his work; the man of gift, of insight, that man is better than ten thousand.  He was savage in his criticism of other writers, even the greatest.  Homer, he said, and Archilochus too, deserved to be hooted from the platform and thrashed. Even the main purport of his writings was differently interpreted. Some named his work 'The Muses,' as though it were chiefly a poetic vision; others named it 'The sure Steersman to the Goal of Life'; others, more prosaically, 'A Treatise of Nature.'  [26]  The fundamental principle or fact of being Heraclitus formulated in the famous dictum, 'All things pass.'  In the eternal flux or flow of being consisted its reality; even as in a river the water is ever changing, and the river exists as a river only in virtue of this continual change; or as in a living body, wherein while there is life there is no stability or fixedness; stability and fixedness are the attributes of the unreal image of life, not of life itself.  Thus, as will be observed, from the _material_ basis of being as conceived by Thales, with only a very vague conception of the counter-principle of movement, philosophy has wheeled round in Heraclitus to the other extreme; he finds his permanent element in the negation of permanence; being or reality consists in never 'being' but always 'becoming,' not in stability but in change.  {17}  [27]  This eternal movement he pictures elsewhere as an eternal strife of opposites, whose differences nevertheless consummate themselves in finest harmony.  Thus oneness emerges out of multiplicity, multiplicity out of oneness; and the harmony of the universe is of contraries, as of the lyre and the bow.  _War_ is the father and king and lord of all things.  Neither god nor man presided at the creation of anything that is; that which was, is that which is, and that which ever shall be; even an ever-living Fire, ever kindling and ever being extinguished.  [28]  Thus in _Fire_, as an image or symbol of the underlying reality of existence, Heraclitus advanced to the furthest limit attainable on physical lines, for the expression of its essentially _motive_ character.  That this Fire was no more than a symbol, suggested by the special characteristics of fire in nature,--its subtlety, its mobility, its power of penetrating all things and devouring all things, its powers for beneficence in the warmth of living bodies and the life-giving power of the sun,--is seen in the fact that he readily varies his expression for this principle, calling it at times the Thunderbolt, at others the eternal Reason, [29] or Law, or Fate.  To his mental view creation was a process eternally in action, the fiery element descending by the law of its being into the cruder [30] forms of water and earth, only to be resolved again by upward process into fire; even as one sees the {18} vapour from the sea ascending and melting into the [32] aether.  As a kindred vapour or exhalation he recognised the Soul or Breath for a manifestation of the essential element.  It is formless, ever changing with every breath we take, yet it is the constructive and unifying force which keeps the body together, and conditions its life and growth.  At this point [33] Heraclitus comes into touch with Anaximenes.  In the act of breathing we draw into our own being a portion of the all-pervading vital element of all being; in this universal being we thereby live and move and have our consciousness; the eternal and omnipresent wisdom becomes, through the channels of our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20500"],["title","A Short History of Greek Philosophy (#3)"],["body",", and especially through the eyes, in fragments at least our wisdom.  In sleep we are not indeed cut off wholly from this wisdom; through our breathing we hold as it were to its root; but of its flower we are then deprived.  On awaking again we begin once more to partake according to our full measure of the living thought; even as coals when brought near the fire are themselves made partakers of it, but when taken away again become quenched.  [34]  Hence, in so far as man is wise, it is because his spirit is kindled by union with the universal spirit; but there is a baser, or, as Heraclitus termed it, a moister element also in him, which is the element of unreason, as in a drunken man.  And thus the trustworthiness or otherwise of the senses, as the {19} channels of communication with the divine, depends on the _dryness_ or _moistness_,--or, as we should express it, using, after all, only another metaphor,--on the _elevation_ or _baseness_ of the spirit that is within.  To those whose souls are base and barbarous, the eternal movement, the living fire, is invisible; and thus what they do see is nothing but death.  Immersed in the mere appearances of things and their supposed stability, they, whether sleeping or waking, behold only dead forms; their spirits are dead.  [35]  For the guidance of life there is no law but the common sense, which is the union of those fragmentary perceptions of eternal law, which individual men [37] attain, in so far as their spirits are dry and pure.  Of absolute knowledge human nature is not capable, but only the Divine.  To the Eternal, therefore, alone all things are good and beautiful and just, because to Him alone do things appear in their totality.  To the human partial reason some things are unjust and others just.  Hence life, by reason of the limitations [38] involved in it, he sometimes spoke of as the death of the soul, and death as the renewal of its life.  And so, [39] in the great events of man's life and in the small, as in the mighty circle of the heavens, good and evil, life and death, growth and decay, are but the systole and diastole, the outward and inward pulsation, of an eternal good, an eternal harmony.  Day and {20} night, winter and summer, war and peace, satiety and hunger--each conditions the other, all are part of God.  It is sickness that makes health good and sweet, hunger that gives its pleasure to feeding, weariness that makes sleep a good.  [39]  This vision of existence in its eternal flux and interchange, seems to have inspired Heraclitus with a contemplative melancholy.  In the traditions of later times he was known as the _weeping_ philosopher. Lucian represents him as saying, \"To me it is a sorrow that there is nothing fixed or secure, and that all things are thrown confusedly together, so that pleasure and pain, knowledge and ignorance, the great and the small, are the same, ever circling round and passing one into the other in the sport of time.\"  \"Time,\" he says elsewhere, \"is like a child that plays with the dice.\"  The highest good, therefore, for mortals is that clarity of perception in respect of oneself and all that is, whereby we shall learn to apprehend somewhat of the eternal unity and harmony, that underlies the good and evil of time, the shock and stress of circumstance and place.  The highest virtue for man is a placid and a quiet constancy, whatever the changes and chances of life may bring.  It is the pantheistic apathy.  The sadder note of humanity, the note of Euripides and at times of Sophocles, the note of Dante and of the _Tempest_ of Shakespeare, of Shelley and Arnold {21} and Carlyle,--this note we hear thus early and thus clear, in the dim and distant utterances of Heraclitus.  The mystery of existence, the unreality of what seems most real, the intangibility and evanescence of all things earthly,--these thoughts obscurely echoing to us across the ages from Heraclitus, have remained, and always will remain, among the deepest and most insistent of the world's thoughts, in its sincerest moments and in its greatest thinkers.     {22}  CHAPTER III  PYTHAGORAS AND THE PYTHAGOREANS  _The Pythagorean Brotherhood--Number the master--God the soul of the world--Music and morals_   [41]  The birthplace of Pythagoras is uncertain.  He is generally called the Samian, and we know, at all events, that he lived for some time in that island, during or immediately before the famous tyranny [43] of Polycrates.  All manner of legends are told of the travels of Pythagoras to Egypt, Chaldaea, Phoenicia, and even to India.  Others tell of a mysterious initiation at the sacred cave of Jupiter in Crete, and of a similar ceremony at the Delphic oracle.  What is certain is that at some date towards the end of the sixth century B.C. he removed to Southern Italy, which was then extensively colonised by Greeks, and that there he became a great philosophic teacher, and ultimately even a predominating political influence.  [46]  He instituted a school in the strictest sense, with its various grades of learners, subject for years to a vow of silence, holding all things in common, and admitted, according to their approved fitness, to {23} [47] successive revelations of the true doctrine of the Master.  Those in the lower grades were called Listeners; those in the higher, Mathematicians or Students; those in the most advanced stage, Physicists or Philosophers.  With the political relations of the school we need not here concern ourselves.  In Crotona and many other Greek cities in Italy Pythagoreans became a predominant aristocracy, who, having learned obedience under their master, applied what they had learned in an anti-democratic policy of government.  This lasted for some thirty years, but ultimately democracy gained the day, and Pythagoreanism as a political power was violently rooted out.  Returning to the philosophy of Pythagoras, in its relation to the general development of Greek theory, we may note, to begin with, that it is not necessary, or perhaps possible, to disentangle the theory of Pythagoras himself from that of his followers, Philolaus and others. The teaching was largely oral, and was developed by successive leaders of the school.  The doctrine, therefore, is generally spoken of as that, not of Pythagoras, but of the Pythagoreans.  Nor can we fix for certain on one fundamental conception, upon which the whole structure of their doctrine was built.  [52]  One dictum we may start with because of its analogies with what has been said of the earlier {24} philosophies.  The universe, said the Pythagoreans, was constituted of _indefinites_ and _definers_, _i.e._ of that which has no character, but has infinite capacities of taking a character; and secondly, of things or forces which impose a character upon this.  Out of the combination of these two elements or principles all knowable [53] existences come into being.  \"All things,\" they said, \"as known have _Number_; and this number has two natures, the Odd and the Even; the known thing is the Odd-Even or union of the two.\"  [66]  By a curious and somewhat fanciful development of this conception the Pythagoreans drew up two parallel columns of antithetical principles in nature, ten in each, thus:--    Definite              Indefinite   Odd                   Even   One                   Many   Right                 Left   Male                  Female   Steadfast             Moving   Straight              Bent   Light                 Dark   Good                  Evil   Four Square           Irregular  Looking down these two lists we shall see that the first covers various aspects of what is conceived as the ordering, defining, formative principle in nature; and that the second in like manner comprises various {25} aspects of the unordered, neutral, passive, or disorganised element or principle; the first, to adopt a later method of expression, is _Form_, the second _Matter_.  How this antithesis was worked out by Plato and Aristotle we shall see later on.  [54]  While, in a sense, then, even the indefinite has number, inasmuch as it is capable of having number or order imposed upon it (and only in so far as it has this imposed upon it, does it become knowable or intelligible), yet, as a positive factor, Number belongs only to the first class; as such it is the source of all knowledge and of all good. In reality the Pythagoreans had not got any further by this representation of nature than was reached, for example, by Anaximander, and still more definitely by Heraclitus, when they posited an Indefinite or Infinite principle in nature which by the clash of innate antagonisms developed into a knowable universe (see above, pp. 12, 16). But one can easily imagine that once the idea of Number became associated with that of the knowable in things, a wide field of detailed development and experiment, so to speak, in the arcana of nature, seemed to be opened.  Every arithmetical or geometrical theorem became in this view another window giving light into the secret heart of things.  Number became a kind of god, a revealer; and the philosophy of number a kind of religion or mystery.  And this is why the {26} second grade of disciples were called Mathematicians; mathematics was the essential preparation for and initiation into philosophy.  Whether that which truly exists was actually identical with Number or Numbers, or whether it was something different from Number, but had a certain relation to Number; whether if there were such a relation, this was merely a relation of analogy or of conformability, or whether Number were something actually embodied in that which truly exists--these were speculative questions which were variously answered by various teachers, and which probably interested the later more than the earlier leaders of the school.  [56]  A further question arose: Assuming that ultimately the elements of knowable existence are but two, the One or Definite, and the Manifold or Indefinite, it"]]]
