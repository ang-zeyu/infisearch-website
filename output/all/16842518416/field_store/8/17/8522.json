The name is a suitable one, and signifies that its wearer is a child of sorrow.\"  \"Jeremiah also suggests lamentations, and has the further merit of being my own name.\"  \"Tristram--\"  \"Jeremiah--\"  \"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" cried Dr. Beckerleg, \"would it not be as well to see the infant?\"  \"I can imagine,\" Captain Barker answered, \"nothing in the infant that is likely to shake my resolution.  My scheme of discipline will be based--\"  \"Decidedly, Jack, I shall have to run you through,\" said his friend gloomily.  Indeed, the Doctor stood in instant fear of this catastrophe; for Captain Runacles' temper was a byword, and not even his customary dark flush looked so dangerous as the lustreless, sullen eyes now sunk in a face that was drawn and pinched and absolutely wax-like in colour.  To the Doctor's astonishment, however, it was the little hunchback who now jumped up and whipped out his sword.  \"Run me through!\" he almost screamed, dancing before the other and threatening him with absurd flourishes--\"Run me through?\"  \"Listen, gentlemen; listen, before blood is spilt!  To me it appears evident that you are both drunk.\"  \"To me that seems an advantage, since it equalises matters.\"  \"But whichever of you survives, he will be unable to forgive himself; having sinned not only against God, but also against logic.\"  \"How against logic?\"  \"Permit me to demonstrate.  Mrs. Salt, whom (as I well know) you esteemed, is lost to you; and in her place is left a babe whom-- healthy though he undoubtedly is--you cannot possibly esteem without taking a great deal for granted, especially as you have not yet set eyes on him.  Now it is evident that, if one of you should kill the other, a second life of approved worth will be sacrificed for an infant of purely hypothetical merits.  As a man of business I condemn the transaction.  As a Christian I deprecate the shedding of blood. But if somebody's blood must be shed, let us be reasonable and kill the baby!\"  Captain Barker lowered his point.  \"Decidedly the question is more difficult than I imagined.\"  \"At least it cannot be settled before eating,\" said Dr. Beckerleg, as the drawer entered with a tray.  \"You will forgive me that I took the liberty of ordering breakfast as soon as I looked into this room. Without asking to see your tongues, I prescribed dried herrings and home-brewed ale; for myself, a fried sole, a beef-steak reasonably under-done, a kidney-pie which the drawer commended on his own motion, with a smoked cheek of pork, perhaps--\"  \"You wish us to sit still while you devour all this?\"  \"I am willing to give each side of the argument a fair chance.\"  \"But I find nothing to argue about!\" exclaimed Captain Runacles, pushing his plate from him after a very faint attempt to eat. \"My mind being already made up--\"  \"And mine,\" interrupted Captain Barker.  \"If I suggest that both of you adopt the child,\" Dr. Beckerleg begun.  \"Still he must be educated; and our notions of education differ. Moreover, when we differ--as you may have observed--we do so with some thoroughness.\"  \"Let me propose, then, a system of alternation, by which you could adopt the boy for six months each, turn and turn about.\"  \"But if--as would undoubtedly happen--each adoptive parent spent his six months in undoing the other's work, it must follow that, at the end of any given period, the child's mind would be a mere _tabula rasa_.  Suppose, on the other hand, we failed to wipe out each other's teaching, the unfortunate youth would be launched upon life with half his guns pointed inboard and his needle jerking from one pole to the other.  Consider the name, Jeremiah Tristram!\"  \"It is heterogeneous,\" admitted the Doctor.  \"He would be called Tristram Jeremiah,\" Captain Barker put in.  \"Well, but that is not less heterogeneous.  O wise Solomon!\" cried the Doctor, with his mouth full of kidney-pie; \"had I but the authority you enjoyed in a like dispute, I would resign to you all the credit of originality!\"  \"As it is, however, you are wasting our time, and it becomes clear that we must fight, after all.\"  \"By no means; for I have this moment received an inspiration. Drawer!\"  The drawer answered this summons almost before it was uttered, by appearing in the doorway with a dish of eggs and a fresh tankard.  \"Set the dish down and attend,\" commanded Dr. Beckerleg.  \"You have a dice-box and dice in the house?\"  \"No, sir.  His worship the Mayor--\"  \"My good fellow, the regulations against play in this town are well known to me; also that the Crowns is an orderly house.  Let me suggest, then, that you have several gentlemen of the army lodging under this roof; that one of these, if politely asked, might own that he had come across such a thing as a dice-box during his sojourn in the Low Countries.  It may even be that in the sack of some unpronounceable town or other he has acquired a specimen, and is bringing it home in his valise to exhibit it to his family.  Be so good as to inform him that three gentlemen, in Room No. 6, who are about to write a tractate on the amusements of the Dutch--\"  \"By your leave, sir, I don't know how it may be on campaign; but in this house we never awaken a soldier for any reason which he cannot grasp at once.\"  \"In that case let him have his sleep out before you vex him with our apologies.  But meanwhile bring the dice.\"  The fellow went out, whispered to the chamber-maid, and returned in less than five minutes with a pair of dice and a leathern box much worn with use.  \"They belong,\" he whispered, \"to a young gentleman of the Admiral's regiment, who was losing heavily last night.\"  \"Thank you; they are the less likely to be loaded.  You may retire for a while.  My friends,\" the Doctor continued, as soon as they were alone, \"Aristotle invented Chance to account for the astonishing fact that there were certain things in the world which he could not explain.  I appeal to it for as cogent a reason.  Indeed, had Mistress Margaret--whose soul God has this night resumed--had she, I say, been spared to receive and ponder the two letters which I saw you deliver at her door; and had she invited me, as a tried friend, to decide between them, I feel sure I should have ended by putting a dice-box into her hands.  Do not blush.  No true man need blush that he has loved such a woman: and you are both true men, if a trifle obstinate--_justi et tenaces propositi_.  Men of your character, Flaccus tells us, do not blench at the thunderbolts of Jove himself; and truly, I can well imagine his missile fizzing harmlessly into your party hedge, unable to decide between the pavilion of Captain John and the pavilion of Captain Jeremy.  But Chance, being witless, discriminates without trouble; and because she is blind, her arbitraments offend nobody's sensibility.  Do you consent?\"  The two captains looked at the dice-box and nodded.  \"The conditions?\"  \"One throw,\" said Captain Runacles.  \"And the highest cast to win,\" added Captain Barker.  \"You, Captain Barker, are the senior by a year, I believe.  Will you throw first?\"  The little man caught up the box, rattled the dice briskly, and threw--four and three.  Captain Runacles picked them up, and made his cast deliberately--six and ace.  \"Gentlemen, you must throw again.  Fortune herself seems to hesitate between you.\"  Captain Barker threw again, and leant back with a sob of triumph.  \"Two sixes, upon my soul!\" murmured the Doctor.  \"I'm afraid, Captain Jeremy--\" Captain Jeremy took the dice up, turned them between finger and thumb, and dropped them slowly into the box.  As he lifted his hand to make the cast he looked up and saw the gleam in his friend's greenish eyes.  The next moment box and dice flew past the hunchback's head and out at the open window.  \"That's my throw,\" Captain Runacles announced, standing up and turning his back on the pair as he staggered across the room for his hat.  But the little man also had bounced up in a fury.  \"That's a vile trick!  I make the best throw, and you force me to fight.\"  \"Ah,\" said the other, facing slowly about and putting on his hat. \"I didn't see it in that light.  Very well, Jack, I decline to fight you.\"  \"You apologise?\"  \"Certainly.\"  The little man held out a hand.  \"I might have known, Jemmy, you were too good a fellow--\" he began.  \"Oh, stow away your pretty speeches and take back your hand.  I can't prevent your playing the fool with Meg's child; but if I had a decent excuse, you may make up your mind I'd use it.  As it is, the sight of you annoys me.  Good morning!\"  He went out, slamming the door after him, and they heard him descend the stairs and turn down the street.  \"A day's peace,\" mused Captain Barker, \"strikes me as more expensive than a year's war.  It has cost me my two dearest friends.\"  He strode up and down the room muttering angrily; then looked up and said:  \"Take me to Meg; I want to see her.\"  \"And the child?\"  \"To be sure.  I'd clean forgotten the child.\"  Dr. Beckerleg led the way downstairs.  A pale sunshine touched the edge of the pavement across the road, and while Captain Barker was settling the bill, the doctor stepped across and picked a dice-box out of the gutter.  \"Luckily I found the dice, too; they were lying close together,\" said he, as his companion came out.  He turned the box round and appeared to be reflecting; but next moment walked briskly into the bar and returned the dice to the drawer, with a small fee.  \"She is not much changed?\" asked the Captain, as they moved down the street arm in arm.  \"Eh? You were saying?  No, not changed.  A beautiful face.\"  Though middle-aged and lined with trouble it was, as Dr. Beckerleg said, a beautiful face that slept behind "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19977"],["title","The Blue Pavilions (#4)"],["body","dusty window above the court where the sparrows chattered.  From a chamber at the back of the house the two men were met, as they climbed the stairs, by the sound of an infant's wailing.  Dr. Beckerleg went towards this, after opening for the Captain the door of a room wherein no sound was at all.  When, half an hour later, Captain Barker came out and closed this door gently, Dr. Beckerleg, who waited on the landing, forbore to look a second time at his face.  Instead he stared fixedly at the staircase wall and observed:  \"I think it is time we turned our attention upon the child.\"  \"Take me to him by all means.\"  Margaret's son was reclining, very red and angry, in the arms of an old woman who attempted vainly to soothe him by tottering up and down the room as fast as her decrepit legs would carry her. The serving-girl, who had opened the door on the previous evening, stood beside the window, her eyes swollen with weeping.  \"He is extremely small,\" said the Captain.  \"On the contrary, he is an unusually fine boy.\"  \"He appears to me to want something.\"  \"He wants food.\"  \"Bless my soul! Has none been offered to him?\"  \"Yes; but he refuses it.\"  \"Extraordinary!\"  \"Not at all.  I understand--do I not?--that you have adopted this infant.\"  The Captain nodded.  \"Then your parental duties have already begun.  You must come with me at once and choose a wet nurse.\"  As they passed through the hall to the front-door, Captain Barker perceived two letters lying side by side upon a table there. He snatched them up hastily and crammed one into his pocket. Then, handing the other to Dr. Beckerleg:  \"You might give that to Jemmy when you see him, and--look here, as soon as the child is out of the house, I think--if you went to Jemmy--he might like to see Meg, you know.\"    CHAPTER III.   THE TWO PAVILIONS.  Captain Barker and Captain Runacles had been friends from boyhood. They had been swished together at Dr. Huskisson's school, hard by the Water Gate; had been packed off to sea in the same ship, and afterwards had more than once smelt powder together.  Admiral Blake and Sir Christopher Mings had turned them into tough fighters by sea; and Margaret Tellworthy had completed their education ashore, and made them better friends by rejecting both.  In an access of misogyny they had planned and built their blue pavilions, beside the London road, vowing to shut themselves up and look on no woman again. This happened but a short time before the first Dutch War, in which the one served under Captain Jonings in the _Ruby_ and the other had the honour to be cast ashore with Prince Rupert himself, aboard the _Galloper_.  Upon the declaration of peace, in the autumn of 1667, they had returned, and, forgetting their vow, laid siege again to their mistress, who regretted the necessity of refusing them thrice apiece.  Upon his third rejection, Jeremy Runacles was driven by indignation to offer his hand at once to Mistress Isabel Seaman, sister of that same Robert Seaman who, as Mayor of Harwich, admitted Sir Anthony Deane to the freedom of the Corporation, and had the honour to receive, in exchange, twelve fire-buckets for the new town-hall. As Mistress Isabel inherited a third of the profits amassed by her father in the rope-making trade, she was considered a good match. Captain Barker, however, resented the marriage on the ground that she was out of place in a pavilion expressly designed for a confirmed bachelor.  When, after a few months, her husband also began to hold this view, Mrs. Runacles, instead of reminding him that he, and he alone, was to blame for her intrusion, did her best to make matters easy by quitting this world altogether on St. Bartholomew's Eve, 1670, leaving behind her the smallest possible daughter.  But as this daughter at once required a nurse, the alleviation proved to be inconsiderable--as Mr. Runacles would have delighted to point out to his wife, had she remained within earshot.  As it was, he took infinite pains to select a suitable nurse, and forthwith neglected the child entirely--a course of conduct which was not so culpable as might be supposed, since (with the sole exception of Mrs. Runacles) he had never been known to err in choosing a subordinate.  In times of peace he gave himself up to studying the mathematics, in which he was a proficient, and to the designing of such curious toys as sundials, water-clocks, pumps, and the like; which he so multiplied about the premises, out of pure joy in constructing them, that Simeon, his body-servant, had much ado to live among the many contrivances for making his life easier.  Although the two pavilions were exactly similar in shape and colour, their gardens differed in some important respects. On Captain Runacles' side of the hedge all was order--trim turf and yews accurately clipped, though stunted by the sea winds. Captain Barker's factotum, Narcissus Swiggs by name, was a slow man with but a single eye.  His orbit in gardening was that of the four seasons, but he had the misfortune to lag behind them by the space of three months; while the two sides of the gravel path, though each would be harmonious in itself, could only be enjoyed by shutting one eye as you advanced from the blue gate to the blue front-door. The particular pride of Captain Barker's garden, however, was a collection of figure-heads set up like statues at regular intervals around the hedge.  The like of it could be found nowhere. Here, against a background of green, and hanging forward over a green lawn, were an Indian Chief, a Golden Hind, a Triton, a Centaur, an effigy of King Charles I., another of Britannia, a third of the god Pan, and a fourth of Mr. John Phillipson, sometime alderman and shipowner of Harwich.  Though rudely modelled, the majority received an extremely lifelike appearance from their colouring, which was renewed every now and then under the Captain's own supervision. He asserted them to be beautiful, and his acquaintances were content with the qualification that to an unwarned visitor, in an uncertain light, they might be disconcerting.  To this paradise Captain Barker introduced his newly adopted son, with the wet-nurse that the Doctor had found for him: and after explaining matters to Narcissus--who had heard of the _Wasp's_ arrival in port and had been vaguely troubled by a long conversation with Simeon, next door--installed the new-comers in the two rooms under the roof of the pavilion and sat down to meditate and wait for the child's development.  On the fourth morning after the installation, Narcissus appeared and demanded a higher wage.  This was granted.  On the sixth morning, Narcissus appeared again.  \"That there nurse--\" he began.  \"What of her?\"  \"As touching that there nurse, your instructions were to feed her up.\"  \"Well?\"  \"I've fed her up.\"  \"Well?\"  \"She's ate till she's sick.\"  The Captain sent post-haste for Dr. Beckerleg.  \"That woman's green with bile,\" the Doctor announced.  \"You've been over-feeding her.\"  \"I did it to strengthen the child.\"  \"No doubt; but this sort of woman will eat all that's put before her. Lower her diet.\"  This was done.  The woman recovered in a couple of days and resigned her place at once, declaring she was starved.  A second wet-nurse was sought for and found.  The child thrived, was weaned, and began to cut his teeth without any trouble to mention. Twice a day Captain Barker visited his nursery and studied him attentively.  \"I'll own that I'm boggled,\" he confessed to Dr. Beckerleg. \"You see, a child is the offspring of his parents.\"  \"That is undeniable!\" the Doctor answered.  \"And science now asserts that he inherits his parents' aptitudes: therefore, to train him _secundum naturam_, I must discover these aptitudes and educate or check them.\"  \"Decidedly.\"  \"Well, but his mother was an angel, and his father the dirtiest scamp that ever cheated the halter.\"  \"I should advise you to strike a mean.  What of the child himself?\"  \"He does nothing but eat.\"  \"It appears to me that, striking a mean between the two extremes you mention, we arrive at mere man.  I perceive a great opportunity. Suppose you teach him exactly what Adam was taught.\"  \"Gardening?\"  \"Precisely.  He will start with some advantage over Adam, there being no Eve to complicate matters.\"  \"He shall be taught gardening,\" the little Captain decided.  \"The pursuit will accord well with his temperament, which is notably pacific.  The child seldom or never cries.  At the same time we cannot quite revert to the Garden of Eden.  His life will, almost certainly, bring him more or less into contact with his fellow-men.\"  \"We must expect that.\"  \"Therefore, as a mere measure of precaution, it might be as well to instruct him in the use of the small-sword.\"  \"I will look after that.  There is nothing I shall enjoy more than teaching him--precaution.  We have now, I think, settled everything--\"  \"By no means.\" The Doctor put a hand into his tail-pocket, and after some difficulty with the lining pulled out a small book bound in green leather and tied with a green ribbon.  \"Here,\" he announced, \"is the first volume of a treatise on education.\"  \"Plague take your books!  You're as bad as Jemmy, yonder.  I tell you I'll not addle the boy's head with books.\"  \"But this treatise has the advantage to be unwritten.\"  Dr. Beckerleg untied the ribbon, and holding out the book, turned over a score of pages.  They were all blank.  \"Undoubtedly that is an advantage.  But then, it hardly seems to me to be a treatise.\"  \"No: but it will be when you have written it.\"  \"I?\"  \"Certainly, you intend to train Tristram in accordance with nature. On what do we base our knowledge of nature?  On experiment and observation.  For many reasons your experiments with the child must be limited; but you can observe him daily--hourly, if you like. In this volume you shall record your observations from day to day, _nulla dies sine linea_.  It is the first present I make to him, as his"]]]
