              876 The God of mercy will indulge,                                       595 The God who reigns alone,                                            137 The heavenly spheres to thee, O God,                                 177 The heaven of heavens cannot contain,                                118 The heavens declare his glory,                                       181 The heavens declare thy glory, Lord,                                 185 The heavens, O Lord, thy power proclaim,                             178 The hoary frost, the fleecy snow,                                    866 The hours of evening close,                                          957 The joyful morn, my God, is come,                                     62 The King of heaven his table spreads,                                277 The last full wain has come,--has come,                              879 The leaves around me falling,                                        865 The long lost son, with streaming eyes,                              324 The Lord descended from above,                                       144 The Lord is on his holy throne,                                     1005 The Lord Jehovah reigns,                                             113 The Lord my pasture shall prepare,                                   495 The Lord of glory is my light,                                       645 The Lord our God is clothed with might,                              105 The Lord will come and not be slow,                                  285 The man in life wherever placed,                                     413 The mellow eve is gliding,                                           944 The morning dawns upon the place,                                    227 The mourners came at break of day,                                   605 Theories which thousands cherish,                                   1002 The past is dark with sin and shame,                                 999 The perfect world by Adam trod,                                      697 The promises I sing,                                                 639 The radiant dawn of gospel light,                                    311 There is a God, all nature speaks,                                   101 There is a hope, a blessed hope,                                     380 There is a land mine eye hath seen,                                  564 There is a land of pure delight,                                     555 There is an hour of peaceful rest,                                   557 There is a pure and peaceful wave,                                   991 There is a time when moments flow,                                   960 There is a world we have not seen,                                   560 There's a refuge of peace from the tempests that beat,                25 There's not a star whose twinkling light,                            122 There's not a place in earth's vast round,                           147 There sprang a tree of deadly name,                                  796 There was joy in heaven,                                             333 The saints on earth and those above,                                 395 The Saviour gently calls,                                            669 The Saviour, what a noble flame,                                     223 These mortal joys, how soon they fade,                               525 The spacious firmament on high,                                      175 The spirit in our hearts,                                            275 The spirit moved upon the waves,                                     115 The spring, the joyous spring is come,                               862 The thing my God doth hate,                                          490 The triumphs of the martyred saints,                                 979 The turf shall be my fragrant shrine,                                183 The vineyard of the Lord,                                            722 The wandering star and fleeting wind,                                326 The year begins with promises,                                       858 They who seek the throne of grace,                                   365 Think gently of the erring,                                          813 This child we dedicate to thee,                                      567 This day let grateful praise ascend,                                  40 This day the Lord hath called his own,                                41 This is the fast the Lord doth choose,                               868 This is the first and great command,                                 385 This stone to thee in faith we lay,                                  696 Thou art, Almighty, Lord of all,                                     141 Thou art gone to the grave,                                          567 Thou art, O God, the life and light,                                 174 Thou art the way, and he who sighs,                                  243 Thou book of life, in thee are found,                                196 Thou fount of love and grace,                                        701 Thou gavest, and we yield to thee,                                   588 Thou faint and sick, and worn away,                                  971 Though lost to our sight, we may not deplore thee,                   758 Thou God of hope, to thee we bow,                                    782 Thou God of truth and love,                                          912 Thou, Lord, by mortal eyes unseen,                                   253 Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known,                          140 Thou must go forth alone, my soul,                                   537 Thou power supreme, whose mighty scheme,                             635 Thou whose wide extended sway,                                       307 Thrice happy soul, who, born from heaven,                            342 Through all the changing scenes of life,                             617 Through endless years thou art the same,                             127 Through every age, Eternal God,                                      898 Through sorrow's night and danger's way,                             360 Through the day thy love has spared us,                              952 Through thee we now together come,                                   922 Thus far the Lord has led me on,                                     945 Thus saith the first, the great command,                             355 Thus saith the high and lofty One,                                   364 Thus saith the Lord who built the heavens,                           252 Thus shall thou love th' Almighty Lord,                              341 Th' uplifted eye and bended knee,                                    390 Thy kingdom, Lord, forever stands,                                   132 Thy life I read, my dearest Lord,                                    666 Thy name be hallowed, evermore,                                      100 Thy presence everlasting God,                                        923 Thy presence, gracious God, afford,                                   23 Thy ways, O Lord, with wise design,                                  148 Times without number have I prayed,                                  332 Time by moments steals away,                                         896 Time! what an empty vapor 'tis,                                      897 'Tis a point I long to know,                                         454 'Tis by the faith of joys to come,                                   374 'Tis done, the great transaction's done,                             674 'Tis finished, so the Saviour cried,                                 233 'Tis God the spirit leads,                                           510 'Tis good to weep and mourn for those,                               804 'Tis gone, that bright and orbed blaze,                              948 'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow,                     "]]]
