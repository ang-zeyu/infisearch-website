And he ought to know if anybody does.\"  \"He certainly ought,\" the stranger agreed. Then, thanking Mrs. Ladybug once more, he hurried toward the garden.  \"One moment!\" she called. There were several questions that she wanted to ask the newcomer. She was wildly curious to know who he was and where he came from and what business had brought him to Pleasant Valley.  But he couldn't have heard her. Anyhow, he was out of sight in no time, leaving Mrs. Ladybug almost bursting with the questions that had sprung to her lips.  \"He might have waited a second,\" she muttered. \"But if he has traveled a long way no doubt he's eager to get to his journey's end.\"  Luckily Mrs. Ladybug had kept her eyes open when talking with the gentleman in the striped yellow coat. And as he turned to leave her she looked closely at his carpetbag. On one side of it she read, in big letters:               P. BUG             COLORADO     VII  A HANDSOME STRANGER   LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug was too excited to work. Ever since meeting the stranger in the orchard she had been able to think of nothing but him. Perhaps if she hadn't happened to notice his carpetbag, with the words, \"P. Bug, Colorado,\" upon its side, she might not have been so stirred up.  Anyhow, Mrs. Ladybug kept wondering what business had brought the stranger to Pleasant Valley. She wished she could find out what he was going to do in the potato patch. She wanted to ask him why he chose to have black stripes on his yellow coat, instead of spots. How long had he been traveling? When did he expect to leave the farm? There was no end to the questions that Mrs. Ladybug burned to put to him.  Meanwhile she told the news to everybody she saw. For Mrs. Ladybug dearly loved to spread choice morsels of gossip. It pleased her mightily to tell her neighbors something they didn't know.  People listened to her story with great interest. They were eager to learn all about the stranger, whom Mrs. Ladybug declared to be very handsome.  Mrs. Ladybug made her news last as long as possible in the telling. She made her neighbors wait a bit for every fact, so they would enjoy it to the full. And whenever she stopped anyone and told him about the newcomer, Mrs. Ladybug kept the best part until the last. She always ended her remarks by saying, with a most important air, \"His name is Mr. P. Bug. And he comes from Colorado.\"  That never failed to impress her listeners--which was exactly what Mrs. Ladybug wanted.  Since nobody asked her how she knew the traveler's name, and where he came from, Mrs. Ladybug did not trouble herself to explain that she had read both name and place upon his old-fashioned carpetbag.  There was one thing that puzzled her slightly, when she paused to think about it. How did it happen that the elegant stranger carried a most unfashionable bag?  Mrs. Ladybug soon settled that question to her own satisfaction.  \"He's like me!\" she decided. \"Mr. P. Bug is a hard worker and he doesn't care for show. He's a plain person. No doubt he put on that yellow coat to travel in, because it's his best. But he'll wear overalls, perhaps, if he starts to work in the potato patch--as I suspect he will.\"  At last, however, Mrs. Ladybug met with a rude shock. She was telling her news to Peppery Polly Bumblebee, one of the workers in the hive ruled by Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen. And to Mrs. Ladybug's amazement, when she related the name of the stranger, and the place he came from, Peppery Polly laughed in her face.  \"Mr. P. Bug is not from Colorado,\" said Peppery Polly Bumblebee. \"He has never been off this farm.\"  Well, Mrs. Ladybug was staggered. She gasped. She clung to a leaf to keep from failing.  \"I don't believe that!\" she cried, as soon as she could speak. \"I'll find Mr. Bug himself and learn the truth from him.\"     VIII  SEEKING THE TRUTH   MRS. LADYBUG was determined to know the truth about Mr. P. Bug, the newcomer. And as soon as she had fully recovered from the rude blow that Peppery Polly Bumblebee dealt her, she set out for Farmer Green's garden and the potato patch.  For some time Mrs. Ladybug flew back and forth above the potato vines. It was not an easy matter to find so small a person as Mr. Bug in so big a field. But she discovered him at last. And she was somewhat surprised to see him still in his elegant yellow coat, with the black stripes. For Mrs. Ladybug had expected him to be hard at work, in overalls.  To be sure, Mr. P. Bug did appear to be busy about something or other. He was so busy that he scarcely so much as glanced at Mrs. Ladybug when she spoke to him, mumbling \"Good morning!\" in answer to her greeting, but not taking the trouble to doff his cap.  \"He's at work anyhow,\" thought Mrs. Ladybug. \"He's helping Farmer Green.\" Then she alighted on the potato vine where Mr. Bug was clinging.  \"Don't you remember me?\" she asked.  He shook his head. His mouth seemed to be full of something--Mrs. Ladybug wasn't sure what.  \"Don't you recall speaking to me one time?\" she persisted.  After swallowing, he answered.  \"I can't say I do!\"  \"I'm the person that told you how to get to this potato patch,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained. \"When you met me in the orchard, on your way from Colorado, you stopped and asked me to direct you to Farmer Green's potato patch.\"  For a moment or two Mr. Bug seemed puzzled--especially when Mrs. Ladybug mentioned Colorado. But by the time Mrs. Ladybug had finished speaking, he nodded.  \"So I did!\" he exclaimed. \"I had forgotten all about that. Though now that you speak of it, I do remember meeting a very talkative dame dressed in a polka dot. Possibly I spoke to you about my settling in the potato patch for the summer?\"  \"No!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"But I thought I'd find you here. You seemed in a great hurry to reach this place.\"  \"So I was!\" said Mr. P. Bug. \"And I'm glad I came. This is the finest potato patch in the whole valley--so I have been told.\"  \"You must have seen a good many others on your journey from Colorado,\" Mrs. Ladybug ventured. \"It's a long way from there to here, I suppose.\"  \"I suppose it is,\" Mr. P. Bug murmured. He seemed to be a bit impatient, as if he were in haste to return to his work and didn't care to talk any longer.  \"I suppose you were weeks on the road,\" Mrs. Ladybug went on. \"Are you going back to Colorado after you've finished helping Farmer Green with the potato crop?\"  \"Colorado!\" he blurted. \"I don't know where that place is. I've never been there in all my life.\"     IX  THAT CARPETBAG   MR. P. BUG'S statement amazed Mrs. Ladybug. He said he had never been in Colorado. More than that, he declared he didn't even know where the place was.  Now, Peppery Polly Bumblebee had told Mrs. Ladybug that Mr. P. Bug was no stranger in Pleasant Valley. But Mrs. Ladybug had not believed what she said. Even hearing Mr. Bug's own words, Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help doubting them.  \"Can it be true--\" she asked him--\"can it be true that you've never been off this farm?\"  Mr. Bug quite plainly wished that she would go away and stop bothering him.  \"It can be--it _is_ true,\" he replied carelessly.  At last Mrs. Ladybug had to believe what she heard.  \"Then you're a fraud!\" she cried. '\"You're a cheat! For I read on your carpetbag, when we met in the orchard, 'P. Bug. Colorado.'\"  \"Oh!\" said Mr. Bug with a smile. \"Oh! So _that's_ where you got your odd notion. I wondered how you happened to make such a mistake.\"  \"A perfectly natural mistake, I'm sure!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed indignantly.  \"Well, I dare say it is,\" he admitted. \"But you see, that's not my carpetbag. At least, I didn't get it new. It belonged to my great-great-great-grandfather. Indeed, I'm not sure he wasn't even still greater than I've said. _He_ lived in Colorado once--so I've been told. But I was born and raised on this farm.\"  \"If all this is true,\" said Mrs. Ladybug, \"what were you doing with that carpetbag? And why did you ask me the way to this potato patch?\"  \"I'm in a hurry to get to work,\" Mr. Bug remarked. \"I'll answer just this once. When we met in the orchard I had been away on a little vacation. And Farmer Green's potato patch--so I learned--had been moved since last year.\"  \"Dear me!\" Mrs. Ladybug wailed. \"People will laugh at me for having made such a serious mistake.\"  But Mr. P. Bug didn't say anything about that.  \"Good-by!\" he grunted. And he crawled under a leaf, out of sight.  For once in her life Mrs. Ladybug wasn't eager to talk to her neighbors. On the contrary, she seemed to avoid them. But Peppery Polly Bumblebee called on her and asked her if she had seen the handsome stranger, Mr. P. Bug.  \"Yes!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I've talked with him. And it's true that he has always lived here. There was a slight mistake about his carpetbag. It belonged to one of his ancestors. And since it bears his ancestor's name and address, naturally I thought they both belonged to this Mr. Bug.\"  Peppery Polly laughed.  \"If you don't believe what I tell you, you can ask him yourself!\" Mrs. Ladybug snapped. \"He's at work over in the potato patch, helping Farmer Green.\"  Peppery Polly laughed again, more unpleasantly than ever.  \"_Helping_ Farmer Green!\" she exclaimed. \"He's eating the leaves off the vines as fast as he can. I know that gentleman. He's Mr. Potato Bug. And he's one of the greatest pests on the farm.\"     X  A BIT OF NEWS   CHIRPY CRICKET was looking for Mrs. Ladybug. He had news for her. Now, it wasn't often that anybody could tell Mrs. Ladybug anything. Usually she was the one that told other people bits of gossip. So Chirpy Cricket was specially eager to find her and make known to her what he had learned.  It was about Mrs. Ladybug's cousin. At least, there was a person living in the vegetable garden who claimed to be a cousin of Mrs. Ladybug's.  Chirpy found Mrs. Ladybug in the orchard. But strange to say, she didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20097"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Ladybug (#3)"],["body","at all interested in his news.  \"I dare say I have a cousin in the garden,\" she told him. \"Ours is a big family. I have more cousins than I could ever count. They're as plentiful as the leaves on the trees. I can't stop my work to go and see this one. If I called on all my cousins I'd never have time to help Farmer Green.\"  Chirpy Cricket looked disappointed. He had expected Mrs. Ladybug to show great interest in what he told her. She certainly always thought that others ought to pay strict attention when she related the happenings about the farm. And she always wanted them to act surprised and pleased, too.  \"Aren't you going to the garden?\" Chirpy Cricket demanded. \"Don't you intend to be polite to your cousin?\"  \"Humph!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"She can't be any busier than I am. Why doesn't she come to the orchard to call on me?\"  \"She can't do that,\" he explained. \"Your cousin says that it wouldn't be etiquette. She says you've lived on the farm longer than she has.\"  \"Rubbish!\" Mrs. Ladybug scolded. \"I'm a plain working person. There's too much to do, during the summer, for me to bother with such nonsense.\"  Chirpy Cricket found her rather discouraging. Still he hadn't given up hope of making Mrs. Ladybug change her mind.  \"I fear you're making a mistake,\" he remarked. \"You ought to see this cousin. She's different from any of your family that I've ever met before.\"  \"How is she different?\" Mrs. Ladybug demanded, pausing in her pursuit of insects on the leaves of the apple tree. At last she began to show some signs of interest.  \"I don't know,\" Chirpy Cricket replied. \"I can't say. Maybe it's her clothes that make her look strange.\"  Mrs. Ladybug then started to ask him questions--which was the best of proof that her curiosity had been aroused.  \"What sort of gown was my cousin wearing?\" she inquired. \"Was it a red polka dot, like mine?\"  \"I don't remember,\" he answered.  \"What colors did she have on?\"  \"I didn't notice,\" said Chirpy Cricket.  Mrs. Ladybug gave him a look of disgust.  \"Well, if that isn't just like a man!\" she spluttered. \"Men never can tell how a body's dressed. If I want to learn anything more about this cousin of mine I suppose I'll have to go and see her with my own eyes.\"  And that afternoon she went to the vegetable garden.     XI  THE NEW COUSIN   FOR Mrs. Ladybug, finding her unknown cousin in Farmer Green's vegetable garden was not an easy task. Since Chirpy Cricket hadn't been able to tell Mrs. Ladybug what colors her cousin wore, Mrs. Ladybug didn't know what to expect.  \"I wish I knew whether she was dressed in red, black, blue, yellow or some other color,\" Mrs. Ladybug complained to herself. \"But I don't know that. I don't even know if she carries an umbrella.\"  There was nothing Mrs. Ladybug could do except to ask everyone she met. So she inquired right and left if anybody happened to be acquainted with her cousin. And at last Betsy Butterfly came to Mrs. Ladybug's help.  \"Look among the squash vines!\" Betsy Butterfly advised her. \"I noticed somebody there that looks a bit like you. Maybe it's your cousin.\"  That was very kind of Betsy Butterfly. Mrs. Ladybug was no friend of hers. Indeed, Mrs. Ladybug had often found fault with Betsy for being too pleasure-loving. But Betsy Butterfly was not one of the kind that nurses grudges. She was only too glad to do Mrs. Ladybug a favor.  Mrs. Ladybug thanked her--albeit somewhat grumpily. Then, flying to the place where Farmer Green had planted his squashes, she found a person at whom she stared hard for a few moments.  \"Do you want to speak to me?\" this strange lady inquired. She was a gay appearing creature, dressed in yellow, with black patches on it.  \"I can't tell whether I care to talk to you or not,\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"It all depends. If you're my cousin, I do. If you aren't, I don't.\"  The strange lady laughed lightly.  \"I wonder--\" she replied--\"I wonder if you are Mrs. Ladybug.\"  \"I am,\" said Mrs. Ladybug.  \"Then I'm your cousin!\" cried the other. \"At last I've met you!\" And she rushed towards Mrs. Ladybug with every intention of embracing her.  Mrs. Ladybug backed hastily away.  \"Not so fast!\" she exclaimed. \"If you really are my cousin, well and good! But how do I know that you aren't an impostor?\"  \"A _what_?\" the strange lady faltered. She was, quite naturally, somewhat taken aback by Mrs. Ladybug's coolness.  \"How do I know that you're not a cheat?\" Mrs. Ladybug asked her. \"Have you any references?\"  \"Any _what_?\" stammered the would-be cousin.  \"Any letters about yourself,\" Mrs. Lady explained. \"For all I know, you may be dissembling.\"  \"I may be _whatting_?\" quavered the lady in yellow.  \"Dear me!\" Mrs. Ladybug muttered to herself. \"Must I address this person in words of one syllable?\" Then, to her companion she said bluntly, \"Tell me why you think you and I are related!\"  \"That's easy!\" cried the yellow one. \"I belong to the Ladybug family.\"  Now, you might think that would have satisfied Mrs. Ladybug. But she wasn't convinced yet.  \"My family--\" she declared--\"my family are all famous workers. If you're one of us, where are your working clothes? Where's your red and black polka dot?\"  The cousin tittered. She seemed to be a silly sort of creature.  \"I haven't any red and black polka dot,\" she replied. \"These are my working clothes that I'm wearing now.\"  Mrs. Ladybug shook her head. It was plain that she didn't approve of those clothes--nor of their wearer.     XII  A QUEER WAY TO HELP   MRS. LADYBUG wished that she hadn't come to the vegetable garden to see the person who called herself Mrs. Ladybug's cousin. She wasn't at all the sort of relation that Mrs. Ladybug cared to have.  Although the stranger in yellow was most agreeable, somehow Mrs. Ladybug disliked her exceedingly. And strange to say, Mrs. Ladybug couldn't have told exactly what it was in her cousin that displeased her. It wasn't alone the yellow gown that the new cousin wore. Nor her simpering smile. Nor her trifling manner. It was something else--something that made Mrs. Ladybug feel that she was not to be trusted.  \"I must hurry back to the orchard,\" Mrs. Ladybug announced. \"There's work waiting for me there. I really ought not to have left it to come to see you.\"  \"Don't take your work so seriously!\" her cousin advised her. \"You ought to take more time for amusement. I hope you'll come to see me often.\"  Mrs. Ladybug's opinion of the stranger sank even lower.  \"If some of us weren't earnest about our work the rest of the world would have a sorry time,\" she declared. \"I may as well tell you that I shall not be able to call on you again. I shall be too busy. And there's no use of my urging you to come to see me, because of course you have your work to do too.\"  \"Oh, naturally!\" said Mrs. Ladybug's cousin with an odd smile. \"Still, I could leave it once in a while to make a cousinly call.\"  \"It won't be necessary,\" Mrs. Ladybug told her. \"If I need you, I'll send for you.\" And she said to herself grimly, under her breath, \"She'll never hear from me.\"  \"If I can help you at any time, don't fail to let me know,\" the cousin told Mrs. Ladybug. \"Doubtless I could be of some service, though I'd always rather work on vines--squash and pumpkin preferred.\"  Mrs. Ladybug thanked her. \"I shouldn't want her helping me,\" she thought. \"I'll warrant she's so careless that she would do more harm than good.\" And Mrs. Ladybug looked at the vine on which they were standing.  \"I see you're helping Farmer Green with his squash vines at present,\" she remarked aloud.  \"Yes!\" said her cousin. \"I have this one almost finished.\"  \"Good!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. And she took a closer look at the vine. It seemed far from healthy. In fact she noticed that the leaves were tattered and torn.  \"What are these great holes in the squash leaves?\" she inquired.  Her cousin fidgeted and made no reply. Glancing at her, Mrs. Ladybug thought she was growing a bit red in the face.  Then all at once Mrs. Ladybug guessed the dreadful truth.  \"You've been _eating_ these leaves!\" she cried.  Her cousin tossed her head.  \"A person has to eat something,\" she retorted.  Mrs. Ladybug threw up her hands.  \"I _knew_ you weren't trustworthy,\" she muttered. \"I _knew_ you weren't the sort of relation I'd want anything to do with.\"  Then Mrs. Ladybug left her.  Later, when Chirpy Cricket met her, he asked her if she had seen her cousin who was spending the summer among the squash vines. And he was astonished when Mrs. Ladybug glared at him and exclaimed:  \"Never mention her to me again!\"     XIII  JENNIE JUNEBUG   JENNIE JUNEBUG was a frolicsome fat person. And she was a great joker. The joke that she loved most was this: she loved to bump into people that were flying through the air--to bump into them and knock them, spinning, upon the ground.  Being much heavier than many of her neighbors, Jennie Junebug suffered little from such collisions. And she never could understand why anybody should find fault with her favorite sport. If a body objected to her rough play Jennie Junebug only laughed heartily.  \"I don't mind when I take a tumble,\" she would retort. \"So why should you?\"  And if the sufferer complained that it wasn't the tumble that hurt, so much as the shock of her hard, bulky self, Jennie would shake with merriment and crash into him again.  Really, it was useless to try to reason with her. The safest way was to avoid her if possible, especially after dark. For then was the time that she preferred for her rowdy tricks.  Mrs. Ladybug couldn't abide her. Not only did she dislike Jennie Junebug's jokes. She disapproved of her treatment of Farmer Green. For Jennie Junebug did everything she could to ruin the trees on the farm. She ate their leaves. And that was one thing that Mrs. Ladybug couldn't forgive in anybody.  \"It's a shame--\" Mrs. Ladybug often said--\"it's a shame, the way Jennie Junebug riddles the foliage. Here I work my hardest to save the leaves by ridding them of tiny insects that feed"]]]
