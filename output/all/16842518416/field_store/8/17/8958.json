Henry, delighted with his eloquence, treated                    him with favour and affectionate regard, and                    advanced him to the see of St. David's. Robert                    Mascall was of the order of Friars Carmelites. In                    1402 he was ordered to be continually about the                    King's person, for the advantage and health of his                    soul. Two years afterwards he was advanced to the                    see of Hereford. Pell Rolls.]  But whatever course of study was chalked out for him, and through  (p. 028) however long or short a period before the summer of 1398, or under what guides soever he pursued it, it is impossible to read his letters, and reflect on what is authentically recorded of him, without being involuntarily impressed by an assurance that he had imbibed a very considerable knowledge of Holy Scripture, even beyond the young men of his day. His conduct also in after-life would prepare us for the testimony borne to him by chroniclers, that \"he held in great veneration such as surpassed in learning and virtue.\" Still, whilst we regret that history throws no fuller light on the early days of Henry of Monmouth, we cannot but hope that in the hidden treasures of manuscripts hereafter to be again brought into the light of day, much may be yet ascertained on satisfactory evidence; and we must leave the subject to those more favoured times.[30]                     [Footnote 30: Many ancient documents (of the                    existence of which in past years, often not very                    remote, there can be no doubt,) now, unhappily for                    those who would bring the truth to light, are in a                    state of abeyance or of perdition. To mention only                    one example; the work of Peter Basset, who was                    chamberlain to Henry V. and attended him in his                    wars, referred to by Goodwin, and reported to be in                    the library of the College of Arms, is no longer in                    existence; at least it has disappeared and not a                    trace of it can be found there.]  But whilst doubts may still be thought to hang over the exact time and the duration of Henry's academical pursuits, it is matter of       (p. 029) historical certainty, that an event took place in the autumn of 1398, which turned the whole stream of his life into an entirely new channel, and led him by a very brief course to the inheritance of the throne of England. His father, hitherto known as the Earl of Derby, was created Duke of Hereford by King Richard II. Very shortly after his creation, he stated openly in parliament[31] that the Duke of Norfolk, whilst they were riding together between Brentford and London, had assured him of the King's intention to get rid of them both, and also of the Duke of Lancaster with other noblemen, of whose designs against his throne or person he was apprehensive. The Duke of Norfolk denied the charge, and a trial of battle was appointed to decide the merits of the question. The King, doubting probably the effect on himself of the issue of that wager of battle, postponed the day from time to time. At length he fixed finally upon the 16th of September, and summoned the two noblemen to redeem their pledges at Coventry. Very splendid preparations had been made for the struggle; and the whole kingdom shewed the most anxious interest in the result. On the day appointed, the Lord High Constable and the Lord High Marshal of England, with a very great company, and splendidly arrayed, first entered the lists. About the hour of prime the Duke of Hereford appeared at the barriers on a white courser, barbed with blue and  (p. 030) green velvet, sumptuously embroidered with swans and antelopes[32] of goldsmith's work,[33] and armed at all points. The King himself soon after entered with great pomp, attended by the peers of the realm, and above ten thousand men in arms to prevent any tumult. The Duke of Norfolk then came on a steed \"barbed with crimson velvet embroidered with mulberry-trees and lions of silver.\" At the proclamation of the herald, Hereford sprang upon his horse, and advanced six or seven paces to meet his adversary. The king upon this suddenly threw down his warder, and commanded the spears to be taken from the combatants, and that they should resume their chairs of state. He then ordered proclamation to be made that the Duke of Hereford had honourably[34] fulfilled his duty; and yet, without assigning any reason, he immediately sentenced him to be banished for ten years: at the same time he condemned the Duke of Norfolk to perpetual exile, adding also the confiscation of his property, except only one thousand pounds by the year. This act of tyranny towards Bolinbroke,[35] contrary,    (p. 031) as the chroniclers say, to the known laws and customs of the realm, as well as to the principles of common justice, led by direct consequence to the subversion of Richard's throne, and probably to his premature death.                     [Footnote 31: Rot. Parl. 21 Rich. II. & Rot. Cart.]                     [Footnote 32: It is curious to find that when Henry                    V. met his intended bride Katharine of France, the                    tent prepared for him by her mother the Queen, was                    composed of blue and green velvet, and embroidered                    with the figures of antelopes.]                     [Footnote 33: The Duke of Hereford's armour was                    exceedingly costly and splendid. He had sent to                    Italy to procure it on purpose for that day; he                    spared no expense in its preparation; and it was                    forwarded to him by the Duke of Milan.]                     [Footnote 34: \"Rex proclamari fecit quod Dux                    Herefordiæ debitum suum honorificè                    adimplesset.\"--Wals. 356.]                     [Footnote 35: The \"Chronicle of London\" asserts                    that Richard sought and obtained from the Pope of                    Rome a confirmation of his statutes and ordinances                    made at this time.]  Whilst however the people sympathized with the Duke of Hereford, and reproached the King for his rashness, as impolitic as it was iniquitous, they seemed to view in the sentence of the Duke of Norfolk, the visitation of divine justice avenging on his head the cruel murder of the Duke of Gloucester. It was remarked (says Walsingham) that the sentence was passed on him by Richard on the very same day of the year on which, only one twelvemonth before, he had caused that unhappy prince to be suffocated in Calais.

The first years of Henry of Monmouth fall, in part at least, as we have seen, within the province of conjecture rather than of authentic history: and the facts for reasonable conjecture to work upon are much more scanty with regard to this royal child, than we find to be the case with many persons far less renowned, and still further removed from our day. But from the date of his father's banishment, very few months in any one year elapse without supplying some clue, which enables us to trace him step by step through the whole career of his eventful life, to the very last day and hour of his mortal existence.  His father's exile dates from October 13, 1398, when Henry had just concluded his eleventh year. Whether up to that time he had been   (p. 033) living chiefly in his father's house, or with his grandfather John of Gaunt, or with his maternal grandmother, or with his uncle Henry Beaufort either at Oxford or elsewhere, we have no positive evidence. John of Gaunt did not die till the 3rd of the following February, and he would, doubtless, have taken his grandson under his especial care, at all events on his father's banishment, probably assigning Henry Beaufort to be his tutor and governor. But when Richard sentenced Henry of Bolinbroke, he was too sensible of his own injustice, and too much alive, in this instance at least, to his own danger, to suffer Henry of Monmouth to remain at large. One of the most ancient, and most widely adopted principles of tyranny, pronounces the man \"to be a fool, who when he makes away with a father, leaves the son in power to avenge his parent's wrongs.\" Accordingly Richard took immediate possession of the persons both of the son of the murdered Duke of Gloucester, and of Henry of Monmouth, of whose relatives, as the chroniclers say, he had reason to be especially afraid.  John of Gaunt, we may conclude, now disabled as he was, by those infirmities[36] which hastened him to the grave[37] more rapidly than the mere progress of calm decay, could exert no effectual means    (p. 034) either of sheltering his son from the unjust tyrant who sentenced him to ten years banishment from his native land, or of rescuing his grandson from the close custody of the same oppressor. Still the very name of that renowned duke must have put some restraint upon his royal nephew. The lion had yet life, and might put forth one dying effort, if the oppression were carried past his endurance; and it might have been thought well to let him linger and slumber on, till nature should have struggled with him finally. We find, consequently, that though before Bolinbroke's departure from England Richard had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20489"],["title","Henry of Monmouth, Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected.
