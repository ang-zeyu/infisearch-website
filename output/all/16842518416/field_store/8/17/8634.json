The Sisters of St. Thomas de Villeneuve, who were in charge of an immense hospital, had two old masons who might be seen at all times, trowel in hand, patching up the slightest damage to their buildings; the local manager of a Dufayel store had become almost a fanatic on the subject.  His stock in trade consisted of furniture, china and crockery of all kinds, housed beneath a glass roof, which seemed to attract the Boches' special attention, for during the four years of war just past, I believe that scarcely a week elapsed during which he was not directly or indirectly the victim of their fire.  The effects were most disastrous, but aided by his wife and an elderly man who had remained in their employ, he would patiently recommence scrubbing, sweeping and cleaning, carefully reinstating each object or fragment thereof, in or as near as possible to its accustomed place.  It was nothing less than miraculous to survey those long lines of wardrobes that seemed to hold together by the grace of the Almighty alone; gaze upon whole rows of tables no one of which had the requisite number of legs; behold mere skeletons of chairs, whose seats or backs were missing; sofas where gaping wounds displayed the springs; huge piles of plates each one more nicked or cracked than its predecessor; series of flower pots which fell to pieces in one's hands if one were indiscreet enough to touch them.  \"I don't see the point in straightening things out so often\"--was my casual comment.  \"Why, Madame, what on earth would we do about the inventory when peace comes, if we were not to put a little order into our stock?\" was the immediate reply.  I was sorry I had spoken.   Among the other numerous places of interest was the store of a dealer in haberdashery and draperies.  An honest, well equipped old fashioned French concern, whose long oak counters were well polished from constant use.  The shelves were piled high with piece after piece of wonderful material, but not a single one of them had been exempt from the murderous rain of steel; they were pierced, and pierced, and pierced again.  \"So pierced that there is not a length sufficient to make even a cap!\" explained Madame L., \"but you just can't live in disorder all the time, and customers wouldn't like to see an empty store.  Everything we have to sell is in the cellar!\"  And true enough this subterranean existence had long ceased to be a novelty, and had become almost a habit.  From the basement windows of every inhabited dwelling protruded a stove pipe, and the lower regions had gradually come to be furnished almost as comfortably as the upper rooms in normal days.  Little by little the kitchen chair and the candle had given way to a sofa and a hanging lamp; beds were set up and rugs put in convenient places.  \"We live so close to the trenches that by comparison it seems like a real paradise to us,\" gently explained Madame Daumont, the pork butcher.  Her _charcuterie_ renowned far and wide for its hot meat patès, ready just at noon, had been under constant fire ever since the invasion, but had never yet failed to produce its customary ovenful at the appointed hour.  \"At the time of the battle of Crouy,\" she confessed, \"I was just on the point of shutting up shop and leaving.  I'm afraid I was a bit hasty, but three shells had hit the house in less than two hours, and my old mother was getting nervous.  The dough for my patés was all ready, but I hesitated.  Noon came, and with it my clientèle of Officers.  \"'_Eh bien, nos patés_?  What does this mean!'  \"'No, gentlemen, I'm sorry, but I cannot make up my mind to bear it another day.  I'm leaving in a few moments.'  \"'What?  Leaving?  And we who are going out to meet death have got to face it on empty stomachs?'  \"They were right.  In a second I thought of my own husband out there in Lorraine.  So I said to them 'Come back at four o'clock and they'll be ready.'\"  And then gently, and as though to excuse herself, she added--  \"There are moments though when fear makes you lose your head, but there doesn't seem to be anything you can't get used to.\"  \"You soon get used to it\" was the identical expression of a young farmer's aid who sold fruit, vegetables and flowers beneath an archway that had once been the entrance to the Hotel de la Clef.  She had attracted my attention almost immediately, the brilliant colours of her display, and her pink and white complexion, standing out so fresh and clear against the background of powder-stained stones and chalky ruin heaps.  The next day, after an extra heavy nocturnal bombardment, we went out in search of a melon.  A shell had shattered her impromptu showcase, dislocated a wall on one side of the archway, which menaced immediate collapse.  In fact, the place had become untenable.  \"Oh, it's such a nuisance to have to look for another sure spot,\" was the only lament.  \"Just see, there's a whole basket of artichokes gone to waste--and my roses--what a pity!\"  An explosion had gutted the adjacent building leaving an immense breach opening on to the street from what had once been an office or perhaps a store-room.  \"Just wait a moment,\" she pleaded, \"until I get set up inside there. You can't half see what I've got out here.\"  Five minutes later I returned and explained the object of my quest.  \"We've only got a very few, Madame, our garden is right in their range, and we had a whole melon patch destroyed by splinters, only day before yesterday.  I had three this morning, but I sold them all to the gentleman of the artillery, and I've promised to-morrow's to the Brigade Officers.  I hardly think I shall be able to dispose of any more before the end of the week.  But why don't you go and see 'Père François'?  He might have some.\"  \"You mean old Père François who keeps the public gardens?\"  \"Yes, Madame.\"  \"Oh, I know him very well.  I've often exchanged seeds and slips with him.  Does he still live where he used to?\"  \"I believe so.\"  We were not long seeking him out, and in response to our knocking his good wife opened the door.  \"Oh, he's out in his garden,\" was her reply to our queries.  \"You can't keep him away from it.  But he's going crazy, I think.  He wants to attend to everything all by himself now.  There isn't a soul left to help him, and he'll kill himself, or be killed at it as sure as I'm alive.  You'll see, the shells won't miss him.  He's escaped so far but he may not always be so lucky.  He's already had a steel splinter in his thumb, and one of them tore a hole in his cap and in his waistcoat. That's close enough, I should think.  But there's no use of my talking; he just won't listen to me.  He's mad about gardening.  That's what he is!\"  On the old woman's assurance that we would find him by pounding hard on the gateway leading to the Avenue de la Gare, we hastened away, leaving her to babble her imprecations to a lazy tabby cat who lay sunning itself in a low window box.  The old fellow being a trifle deaf we were destined to beat a rather lengthy tattoo on the high iron gate.  But our efforts were crowned with success, for presently we heard his steps approaching, his sabots crunching on the gravel path.  His face lighted up when he saw us.  \"Oh, I remember you, of course I do.  You're the lady who used to have the American sweet peas and the Dorothy Perkins.  I know you!  And the dahlias I gave you?  How did they turn out?\"  I grew red and sought to change the conversation.  Perhaps he saw and understood.  \"Come and see mine anyway!\"  That sight alone would have made the trip worth while.  \"I cut the grass this very morning so as they'd show off better! They're so splendid this year that I've put some in the garden at the Hotel de Ville.\"  Further on the _Gloire de Dijon, La France_ and _Maréchal Niels_ spread forth all their magnificent odorous glory onto the balmy air of this Isle de France country, whose skies are of such exquisite delicate blue, whose very atmosphere breathes refinement.  I felt my old passion rising;--that passion which in times gone by had drawn us from our sleep at dawn, and scissors and pruning knife in hand, how many happy hours had H. and I thus spent; he at his fruit trees, I at my flower beds, cutting, trimming, scraping, clipping; inwardly conscious of other duties neglected, but held as though fascinated by the most alluring infatuation in the world--the love of nature.  Here now in this delightful garden kept up by the superhuman efforts of a faithful old man, the flame kindled anew.  In an instant H. had discovered the espaliers where _Doyenné du Cornice_ and _Passe Cressane_ were slowly but surely attaining the required degree of perfection beneath Père François' attentive care. As I stood open mouthed in wonder before the largest bush of fuchsias I had ever yet beheld, an explosion rent the air, quickly followed by a second, the latter much closer to us.  \"Boche bombs!  Come quick,\" said Père François without seeming in the least ruffled.  Led by the old man we hastened to a tiny grotto, in whose depths we could hear a fountain bubbling.  Legion must have been the loving couples that have visited this spot in times gone by, for their vows of fidelity were graven in endearing terms on the stony sides of the retreat.  _Léon et Marguerite pour toujours, Alice et Théodore, Georges et Germaine_ were scrawled above innumerable arrow-pierced hearts.  \"All things considered, I'd rather they'd send us over a shell or two than bomb us from above!\" ejaculated Père François, who spoke from experience.  \"It was one of those hateful things that hit my Japanese pepper tree on the main lawn, and killed our only cedar.  The handsomest specimen we had here!  It makes me sick every time I throw a log of it on to the fire in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20111"],["title","With Those Who Wait (#4)"],["body","Winter.  I can't tell you how queer it makes me feel.  Of course, it's bad enough for them to kill men who are their enemies, but think of killing trees that it takes hundreds of years to grow.  What good can that do them?\"  The Boche deemed at a safe distance, we visited the vegetable garden where we purchased our melon and were presented with any number of little packets containing seeds.  We protested at the old man's generosity and sought to remunerate him.  \"Nothing of the kind; I wouldn't think of accepting it.  It's my pleasure.  Why it's been ages since I had such a talk as this.  I'm so glad you came.  So glad for my roses too!\" and he started to cut a splendid bouquet.  \"I've been saying to myself every day,\" he continued, \"Isn't it a pity that nobody should see them?  But now I feel satisfied.\"  At the gateway we held out our hands which he took and shook most heartily, renewing his protestations of delight at our visit, and begging us to \"Come again soon.\"  \"To be happy one must cultivate his garden,\" murmured H., quoting Voltaire as we made off down the road.  And within a day or two we again had an excellent proof of this axiom when we discovered that Abbé L. still resided in his little home whose garden extended far into the shadow of St. Jean des Vignes.  That worthy ecclesiastic gave over every moment that was not employed in the exercise of his sacred functions to the joys of archaeological research, and was carefully compiling a history of the churches in the arrondissement of Soissons and Château-Thierry.  He had been our guest at Villiers, and I remember having made for him an imprint of two splendid low-relief tombstones which date back to the 15th century, and were the sole object and ornament of historic interest in our little village chapel.  This history was the joy and sole distraction of his entire existence, and he never ceased collecting documents and photographs, books, plans and maps, all of which though carefully catalogued, threatened one day to take such proportions that his modest dwelling would no longer suffice to hold them.  We found him comfortably installed behind a much littered kitchen table in a room that I had heretofore known as his dining room.  I was a bit struck by its disorder, and the good man was obliged to remove several piles of papers from the chairs before inviting us to be seated.  \"I trust you will forgive this confusion,\" he begged, \"but you see a shell hit my study yesterday noon, and has forced me to take refuge in this corner of the house which is certainly far safer.\"  \"I've had an excellent occasion to work,\" he continued.  \"Our duties are very slight these days, and the extreme quiet in which we live is most propitious for pursuing the task I have undertaken.\"  \"But, Monsieur l'Abbé,\" we cried.  \"What a paradox!  And the bombardment?\"  \"Really, you know, I've hardly suffered from it--except when that shell struck the house the other morning.  Of course, the whole edifice shook, and at one time I thought the roof was coming through upon my head.  My ink bottle was upset and great streams trickled to the floor. But Divine intervention saved my precious manuscript which I was in the very act of copying, and although my notes and files were a bit disarranged, they were easily sorted and set to rights.  So you see there was nothing really to deplore and God has graciously seen fit to let me continue my work.  It is such a joy to be able to do so.\"  Strange placidity! the immediate countryside for miles around having long since been delivered up to brutal destruction, wanton waste, hideous massacre, and a goodly number of the churches of which the pious man was taking so much pains to record the history, were now but anonymous heaps of stone.  All the way home I could not refrain from philosophising on the happiness of life, perfect contentment, and the love of good.  My reflections, while perhaps not particularly deep nor brilliant, were none the less imbued with a sense of gratitude to the Almighty, and filled with pity and respect for poor human nature.  It is certain that for such people, the idea of escaping the terrors, the dangers and the sight of most horrible spectacles, had not weighed an instant in the balance against the repugnance of altering life-long habits, or abandoning an assemblage of dearly beloved landscapes and faces.  Naturally enough, a certain number of commercial minded had remained behind, tempted by the possibility of abnormal gain through catering to the soldier; and to whatever had been their habitual merchandise, was soon added a stock of mandolins, accordions, cheap jewelry, kit bags, fatigue caps and calico handkerchiefs--in fact all that indispensable, gaudy trumpery that serves to attract a clientèle uniquely composed of warriors.  But, besides these merchants, there were still to be counted a certain number of well-to-do citizens, professors, government employés, priests and magistrates, all simple honest souls who had stayed because they were unable to resign themselves to an indefinite residence away from Soissons, and there was no sacrifice to which they were not resolved in advance, so long as it procured them the joy of remaining.  I accompanied the President of the local French Red Cross Chapter on a visit to a lady who was much interested in an _ouvroir_, and who lived in a splendid old mansion located near the ruins of the Palais de Justice.  The little bell tinkled several times, resounding clearly in the deathlike silence, and presently a young maid-servant made her appearance at a small door that opened in the heavy portico.  \"Is Madame at home?\"  \"Oh, no, Madame!  Why didn't Madame know that both Monsieur and Madame left for the seashore last evening?  Shall I give Madame their address at Houlgate?  They've been going there for the last twenty years.  They will be back the first of September as usual.\"  \"How stupid of me,\" exclaimed my companion.  \"I might have known though.  We shall discover what we wish to know from Madame V.\"  We found the last mentioned lady and her daughter in a pretty dwelling on the boulevard Jeanne d'Arc.  After presentations and greetings:  \"You are not leaving town this Summer?\"  \"Not this season; unfortunately our country house is at present occupied by the Germans, and as the mountains are forbidden, and the sea air excites me so that I become quite ill, I fear we shall have to remain at home, for the time being at least.  The garden is really delightfully cool though--we sit out there and sew all day.\"  I asked permission to admire the exquisite embroidered initials which both mother and daughter were working.  \"I'm so glad you like them.  Do you know we found that monogram on an old 18th century handkerchief?  We merely enlarged it, and really feel that we have something quite unusual.  But my table cloths are well worth it, they were the very last that were left at the Cour Batave.  I doubt if any finer quality will ever be woven.\"  \"Your daughter will have a wonderful trousseau.\"  \"She will have something durable at least, Madame, a trousseau that will stand the test of time and washing,\" replied the good mother smiling blandly, touched by my appreciation.  \"I still have sheets which came down to me from my great grand-mother, and I hope that my own great grand-sons will some day eat from this very cloth.\"  \"But they will never guess under what strange circumstances it was hemmed and embroidered,\" gently proffered the young girl raising her big blue eyes and smiling sweetly.  \"Bah, what difference does that make so long as they are happy and can live in peace?  That's the principal thing, the one for which we're all working, isn't it?\"  Such is the spirit that pervades all France.  It is simple, undemonstrative heroism, the ardent desire of a race to last in spite of all.  What more imperturbable confidence in its immortality could be manifested than by this mother and daughter calmly discussing the durability of their family linen, within actual range of Teuton gunfire that might annihilate them at any moment?  As we were about to leave Monsieur S. came up the front steps.  He had been out in company of a friend, making his habitual daily tour of the city.  Like most middle aged, well-to-do bourgeois his attire was composed of a pair of light trousers, slightly baggy at the knee, and a bit flappy about the leg; a black cutaway jacket and a white piqué waistcoat.  This classic costume usually comports a panama hat and an umbrella.  Now Monsieur S. had the umbrella, but in place of the panama he had seen fit to substitute a blue steel soldier's helmet, which amazing military headgear made a strange combination with the remainder of his civilian apparel.  Nevertheless he bowed to us very skilfully, and at that moment I caught sight of a leather strap, which slung over one shoulder, hung down to his waist and carried his gas mask.  [Illustration: MONSIEUR S. OF SOISSONS WITH HIS GAS MASK]  For several days I laboured under the impression that this mode was quite unique, but was soon proved mistaken, for on going to the Post Office to get my mail (three carriers having been killed, there were no longer any deliveries) I discovered that it was little short of general.  Several ladies had even dared risk the helmet, and the whole assembly took on a war like aspect that was quite apropos.  Thus adorned, the octogenarian Abbé de Villeneuve, his umbrella swung across his back, his cassock tucked up so as to permit him to ride a bicycle, was a sight that I shall never forget.  \"Why, Monsieur le Curé, you've quite the air of a sportsman.\"  \"My child, let me explain.  You see I can no longer trust to my legs, they're too old and too rheumatic.  Well then, when a bombardment sets in how on earth could I get home quickly without my bicycle?\"  As visitors to the front, we were guests of the French Red Cross Society while in Soissons.  The local president, whose deeds of heroism have "]]]
