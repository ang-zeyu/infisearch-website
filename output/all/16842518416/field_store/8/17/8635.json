A luncheon in our honour was served on a spotless cloth, in the only room of that lady's residence which several hundred days of constant bombardment had still left intact.  Yet, save for the fact that paper had replaced the window panes, nothing betrayed the proximity of the German.  Through the open, vine grown casement, I could look out onto a cleanly swept little court whose centre piece of geraniums was a perfect riot of colour.  Around the congenial board were gathered our hostess, the old Curé de St. Vast, the General in command of the Brigade, his Colonel, three Aides-de-Camp, my husband and myself.  Naturally, the topic of conversation was the war, but strange as it may seem, it was we, the civilians, that were telling our friends of the different activities that were afoot and would eventually bring the United States to the side of the Allies.  Towards the middle of the repast our enemies began sending over a few shells and presently a serious bombardment was under way.  Yet no one stirred.  Dishes were passed and removed, and though oft times I personally felt that the pattering of shrapnel on the tin roof opposite was uncomfortably close, I was convinced there was no theatrical display of bravery, no cheap heroism in our companions' unconsciousness.  They were interested in what was being said--_voilà tout_.  Presently, however, our hostess leaned towards me and I fancied she was about to suggest a trip cellarward, instead of which she whispered that on account of the bombardment we were likely to go without dessert since it had to come from the other side of town and had not yet arrived.  Then a shell burst quite close, and at the same time the street bell rang.  The _cordon_ was pulled, and through the aperture made by the backward swing of the great door, I caught sight of a ruddy cheeked, fair haired maiden in her early teens, bearing a huge bowl of fresh cream cheese in her outstretched hands.  Steadily she crossed the court, approached the window where she halted, smiled bashfully, set down her precious burden, and timidly addressing our hostess:  \"I'm sorry, Madame,\" said she, \"so sorry if I have made you wait.\"  And so it goes.  I remember a druggist who on greeting me exclaimed:  \"A pretty life, is it not, for a man who has liver trouble?\"  And yet he remained simply because it was a druggist's duty to do so when all the others are mobilised.  There was also the printer of a local daily, who continued to set up his type with one side of his shop blown out; who went right on publishing when the roof caved in, and who actually never ceased doing so until the whole structure collapsed, and a falling wall had demolished his only remaining press.  Monsieur le Préfet held counsel and deliberated in a room against whose outside wall one could hear the constant patter of machine gun bullets raining thick from the opposite bank of the river.  Monsieur Muzart, the Mayor, seemed to be everywhere at once, and was always the first on the spot when anything really serious occurred.  Add to these the little dairy maids, who each morning fearlessly delivered the city's milk; or the old fellow on whom had devolved the entire responsibility of the street-cleaning department and who went about, helmet clad, attending to his chores, now and then shouting a hearty \"_Whoa Bijou_\" to a faithful quadruped who patiently dragged his dump cart, and over whose left ear during the entire Summer, was tied a bunch of tri-colour field flowers.  I had almost forgotten to mention two extraordinary old women, whom I came upon seated out in a deserted street, making over a mattress, while gently discussing their private affairs.  It was the end of a warm July afternoon.  A refreshing coolness had begun to rise from the adjacent river, and in the declining sunlight I could see great swarms of honey bees hovering about a climbing rose bush whose fragrant blossoms hung in huge clusters over the top of a convent wall near by. I could not resist the temptation.  Pressed by the desire to possess I stepped forward and was about to reach upward when a masculine voice, whose owner was hidden somewhere near my elbow called forth:  \"Back, I say!  Back! you're in sight!\"  I quickly dived into the shadow for cover just in time to hear the bullets from a German machine gun whizz past my ear!  \"You can trust them to see everything,\" murmured one of the old women, not otherwise disturbed.  \"But if you really want some roses just go around the block and in by the back gate, Madame.\"  How in the presence of such calm can we believe in war?  Ah, France! elsewhere perhaps there may be just as brave--but surely none more sweetly!     III  The little village was just behind the lines.  The long stretch of roadway, that following the Aisne finally passed through its main street, had been so thoroughly swept by German fire that it was as though pockmarked by ruts and shell holes, always half full of muddy water.  A sign to the left said--      _Chemin, défilé de V._--   There could be no choice; there was but to follow the direction indicated, branch out onto a new highway which, over a distance of two or three miles, wound in and out with many strategic contortions; a truly military route whose topography was the most curious thing imaginable.  If by accident there happened to be a house in its way it didn't take the trouble to go _around_, but _through_ the edifice.  One arrived thus in the very midst of the village, having involuntarily traversed not only the notary's flower garden, but also his drawing-room, if one were to judge by the quality of the now much faded wall paper, and the empty spots where portraits used to hang.  The township had served as target to the German guns for many a long month, and was seriously _amoché_, as the saying goes.  \"Coal scuttles\" by the hundred had ripped the tiles from almost every roof.  Huge breaches gaped in other buildings, while some of them were completely levelled to the ground.  Yet, in spite of all, moss, weeds and vines had sprung up mid the ruins, adding, if possible, the picturesque to this scene of desolation.  One robust morning glory I noted had climbed along a wall right into the soot of a tumble-down chimney, and its fairylike blossoms lovingly entwined the iron bars whereon had hung and been smoked many a succulent ham.  The territorials (men belonging to the older army classes), had installed their mess kitchens in every convenient corner: some in the open court-yards and others beneath rickety stables and sheds, where the sunlight piercing the gloom caught the dust in its rays and made it seem like streams of golden powder, whose brightness enveloped even the most sordid nooks and spread cheer throughout the dingy atmosphere.  Fatigue squads moved up and down the road, seeking or returning with supplies, while those who were on duty, pick and shovel in hand, moved off to their work in a casual, leisurely manner one would hardly term military.  Of civilians there remained but few.  Yet civilians there were, and of the most determined nature: \"hangers-on\" who when met in this vicinity seemed almost like last specimens of an extinct race, sole survivors of the world shipwreck.  At the moment of our arrival an old peasant woman was in the very act of scolding the soldiers, who to the number of two hundred and fifty (a whole company) filled to overflowing her modest lodgings, where it seemed to me half as many would have been a tight squeeze.  It was naturally impossible for her to have an eye on all of them.  In her distress she took me as witness to her trials.  \"Just see,\" she vociferated, \"they trot through my house with their muddy boots, they burn my wood, they're drying up my well, and on top of it all they persist in smoking in my hay-loft, and the hay for next Winter is in!  Shouldn't you think their Officers would look after them?  Why, I have to be a regular watch-dog, I do!\"  \"That's all very well, mother,\" volunteered a little dried up Corporal. \"But how about _their_ incendiary shells?  You'll get one of them sooner or later.  See if you don't!\"  \"If it comes, we'll take it; we've seen lots worse than that!  Humph! That's no reason why you should mess up a house that belongs to your own people, is it?  I'd like to know what your wife would say if she caught you smoking a pipe in her hay loft?\"  Shouts of laughter from the culprits.  Then a tall, lean fellow, taking her side, called out:  \"She's right, boys, she had a hard enough job getting the hay in all by herself.  Put out your pipes since that seems to get on her nerves. Now then, mother, there's always a way of settling a question between honest people.  We won't smoke in your hay any more; that is, provided you'll sell us fresh vegetables for our mess.\"  The old woman was trapped and had to surrender, which she did, but most ungraciously, all the while moaning that she would more than likely die of starvation the following Winter.  So a moment later the group dispersed on hearing the news that the \"Auto-bazaar\" had arrived.  This auto-bazaar certainly contained more treasures than were ever dreamed of in ancient Golconda.  There was everything the soldier's heart might desire, from gun grease and cigarette paper down to wine and provisions; the whole stored away in a literal honey-comb of shelves and drawers with which the sides were lined.  The men all hurried forward.  Loaded with water bottles, their hands full of coppers, they clustered about it.  From his dominating position at the rear end of the truck, the store-keeper announced:  \"No more pork pie left!\"  This statement brought forth several indignant oaths from the disappointed.  \"It's always that way, they're probably paid to play that joke on us. It was the same story last time!  We'll send in a complaint.  See if we don't.\"  But these grumblings were soon outvoiced by the announcement--  \"Plenty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20111"],["title","With Those Who Wait (#6)"],["body"," head-cheese and camembert.  Now then! boys, who's ready?\"  The effect was instantaneous.  Smiles broke out on every countenance.  The good news was quickly spread abroad, and presently the sound of plates and dishes, clinking cups, and joyful laughter recalled a picnic which we had organised in the vicinity, one warm July afternoon some four years ago.  A military band rehearsing a march in an open field just behind us added life and gaiety to the scene, and reminded me of the \"Merry-go-round,\" the chief attraction of that defunct country fair, and upon which even the most dignified of our friends had insisted riding.  After all, could it be possible that this was the very midst of war? Was it such a terrible thing, since the air fairly rung with merriment?  \"Make room there,\" called a gruff voice, not far distant.  \"Stand aside!  Quick now!\"  The crowd parted, and a couple of stretcher bearers with their sad human burden put an end to my soliloquy.  My afternoon was stained with blood.  On their litter they bore a lad whose bloodless lips, fluttering eyelids, and heaving breast, bespoke unutterable suffering.  One must have actually witnessed such sights to realise the enormity of human agony, grasp the torment that a stupid bit of flying steel can inflict upon a splendid human frame--so well, so happy, so full of hope but a second since.  Oh, the pity of it all!  \"Who is it?\" the men whisper.  \"Belongs to the 170th.  They replaced us.  He was caught in the _Boyau des Anglais_.\"  \"That's a wicked spot, that is!\"  \"Is he one of ours?\" questioned a man from an upper window, stopping an instant in the act of polishing his gun.  \"No,\" answers some one.  The enquirer recommenced his work, and with it the refrain of his song, just where he had left off.  \"_Sur les bords de la Riviera_,\" sang he blithely.  Little groups formed along the wayside.  Seated on the straw they finished their afternoon meal, touching mugs, and joking together. Near them the artillerymen greased and verified their axles; others brushed and curried the horses.  In one spot a hair dresser had set up his tonsorial parlor in the open, and his customers formed in line awaiting their turns.  Further on the _permissionaires_ blacked their boots and furbished their raiment, making ready to leave for home.  Swarms of humming birds and bees clustered about a honeysuckle vine which clung to the fragments of a fence near by, and whose fragrance saturated the air.  The friend, whose regiment number we had recognised, and stopped to see, came up from behind and touched me on the shoulder.  \"Well, of all things!  What on earth are you doing here?\"  We explained our mission, and then inquired about mutual acquaintances.  \"Pistre?  Why he's with the munitions in the 12xth.  We'll go over and see him.  It's not far.  But hold on a minute, isn't Lorrain a friend of yours?\"  We acquiesced.  \"Well, his son's my lieutenant.  I'll go and get him.  He'd be too sorry to miss you.\"  He disappeared and a few moments later returned followed by his superior, a handsome little nineteen year old officer, who came running up, his pipe in his mouth, his drinking cup still in his hand.  The lad blushed scarlet on seeing us, for he doubtless recalled, as did I, the times not long gone by, when I used to meet him at a music teacher's, his long curls hanging over his wide sailor collar.  The idea that this mere infant should have command over such a man as our friend Nourrigat, double his age, and whose life of work and struggle had been a marvel to us all, somewhat shocked me.  I think the little chap felt it, for he soon left us, pleading that he must be present at a conference of officers.  \"A brave fellow and a real man,\" commented Nourrigat, as the boy moved away.  \"His whole company has absolute confidence in him.  You can't imagine the calm and prestige that kid possesses in the face of danger. He's the real type of leader, he is!  And let me tell you, he's pretty hard put sometimes.\"  And then in a burst of genuine enthusiasm, he continued:  \"It's wonderful to be under twenty, with a smart little figure, a winsome smile, and a gold stripe on your sleeve.  The women willingly compare you to the Queen's pages, or Napoleon's handsome hussars.  That may be all very well in a salon, or in the drawings you see in 'La Vie Parisienne,' but it takes something more than that to be a true officer.  He's got to know the ropes at playing miner, bombarder, artilleryman, engineer, optician, accountant, caterer, undertaker, hygienist, carpenter, mason--I can't tell you what all.  And in each particular job he's got to bear the terrible responsibility of human lives; maintain the discipline and the moral standard, assure the cohesion of his section.  Moreover, he's called upon to receive orders with calm and reserve under the most difficult and trying circumstances, must grasp them with lightning speed and execute them according to rules and tactics.  A moment of hesitancy or forgetfulness, and he is lost.  The men will no longer follow him.  I tell you it isn't everybody that's born to be a leader!\"  \"But, was he educated for the career?\" we questioned.  \"I don't think so.  I imagine he's just waiting for the end of the war to continue his musical studies--that is if he comes out alive.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I?  Why I've no particular ambition.  I suppose I could have gone into the Camouflage Corps if I'd taken the trouble to ask.  But what's the use of trying to shape your own destiny?\"  \"You've gotten used to this life?\"  \"Not in the least.  I abominate and adore it all in the same breath. Or, to be more explicit, I admire the men and abhor the military pictures, the thrilling and sentimental ideas of the warrior with which the civilian head is so generously crammed.  I love military servitude, and the humble life of the men in the ranks, but I have a genuine horror of heroes and their sublimity.  \"Just look over there,\" he went on, waving his hand towards a long line of seated _poilus_ who were peacefully enjoying their pipes, while wistfully watching the smoke curl upward.  \"Just look at them, aren't they splendid?  Why they've got faces like the 'Drinkers' in the Velasquez picture.  See that little fellow rolling his cigarette? Isn't he the image of the Bacchus who forms the centre of the painting? That's Brunot, and he's thinking about all the god-mothers whose letters swell out his pockets.  He can't make up his mind whether he prefers the one who lives in Marseilles and who sent him candied cherries and her photograph; or the one from Laval who keeps him well supplied with devilled ham which he so relishes.  The two men beside him are Lemire and Lechaptois--both peasants.  When they think, it's only of their farms and their wives.  That other little thin chap is a Parisian bookkeeper.  I'd like to bet that he's thinking of his wife, and only of her.  He's wondering if she's faithful to him.  It's almost become an obsession.  I've never known such jealousy, it's fairly killing him.  \"That man Ballot, just beyond\"--and our friend motioned up the line--\"that man Ballot would give anything to be home behind his watch-maker's stand.  In a moment or so he'll lean over and begin a conversation with his neighbour Thevenet.  They've only one topic, and it's been the same for two years.  It's angling.  They haven't yet exhausted it.  \"All of them at bottom are heartily wishing it were over; they've had enough of it.  But they're good soldiers, just as before the war they were good artisans.  The _métier_ is sacred--as are the Family and Duty.  'The Nation, Country, Honour' are big words for which they have a certain repugnance.  \"'That's all rigmarole that somebody hands you when you've won the Wooden Cross and a little garden growing over your tummy,' is the way they put it in their argot.  'The Marseillaise, the Chant du Depart are all right for the youngsters, and the reviews--and let me tell you, the reviews take a lot of furbishing and make a lot of dust.  That's all they really amount to.'  \"When they sing, it's eternally 'The Mountaineers' who, as you know, are always 'there,' 'Sous les Ponts de Paris,' 'Madelon' and other sentimental compositions, and if by accident, in your desire to please, you were prone to compare them to the heroes of Homer, it's more than likely your pains would be rewarded by the first missile on which they could lay their hands and launch in your direction.  They will not tolerate mockery.  \"No\"--he went on, filling his pipe, and enunciating between each puff. \"No, they are neither supermen nor heroes; no more than they are drunkards or foul mouthed blackguards.  No, they are better than all that--they are men, real men, who do everything they do well; be it repairing a watch, cabinet-making, adding up long columns of figures or peeling potatoes, mounting guard, or going over the top!  They do the big things as though they were small, the small things as though they were big!  \"Two days ago the captain sent for two men who had been on patrol duty together.  He had but one decoration to bestow and both chaps were in hot discussion as to who should _not_ be cited for bravery.  \"'Now, boys, enough of this,' said the captain.  'Who was leading, and who first cut the German barbed wire?'  \"'Dubois.'  \"'Well then, Dubois, what's all this nonsense?  The cross is yours.'  \"'No, sir, if you please, that would be idiotic!  I'm a foundling, haven't any family.  What's a war cross more or less to me?  Now Paul here keeps a café; just think of the pleasure it will give his clientèle to see him come back decorated.'  \"The captain who knows his men, understood Dubois' sincerity, and so Paul got the medal.  \"I believe it was Peguy who said that 'Joan of Arc' has the same superiority over other saints, as the man who does his military service has over those who are exempt.'  But it's only the soldiers who really understand that, and when they say _On les aura_, it means"]]]
