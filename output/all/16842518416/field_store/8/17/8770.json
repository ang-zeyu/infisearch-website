WYN ROOSEVELT  This series tells the adventures of Jim, Joe, and Tom Darlington, first in their camp wagon as they follow the trail to the great West in the early days. They are real American boys, resourceful, humorous, and--but you must meet them. You will find them interesting company. They meet with thrilling adventures and encounters, and stirring incidents are the rule, not exception.  Historically, these books present a true picture of a period in our history as important as it was picturesque, when the nation set its face toward this vast unknown West, and conquered it.     1.

Hope they don't choke.\"  \"I'm already, Bob,\" said Jim.  \"No, you're not,\" replied Ketchel; \"go back to your luxurious caboose and get your heaviest coat and your trusty revolver; we might see some game going through the Pass,\" and Bob winked wisely at his \"boyhood\" friend.  \"Don't pull out until I get back,\" warned Jim, as he started on a trot toward one of the rear Pullmans, called a \"caboose\" by the flippant Bob.  \"'The General Denver' leaves in three minutes,\" called Ketchel after the retreating Jim; \"wouldn't wait a second for nobody.\" From the fact that the locomotive was given the dignity of a real name indicates that the time of our narrative belongs to an earlier and more ornate day than this when even the biggest engine gets nothing more than a number.  At Ketchel's warning, Jim quickened his pace to a run, for he would not have missed that ride on the \"General Denver\" for all the buried wealth he and his brothers had once found on a treasure hunt in Old Mexico. I wonder if an introduction to our old friend, Jim Darlington, is really necessary. At least I am going through the formality. Jim, the leader of \"The Frontier Boys,\" whose adventures began on \"The Overland Trail,\" and were last spoken of in the narrative, \"In The Saddle,\" is now on his way to San Francisco in response to a message sent to him by the engineer of his captured yacht, _The Sea Eagle_. He had been spending the Christmas time at his home in Maysville, New York, where his brothers, Tom and Jo, remained for the winter, much to their mother's joy, but to their own deep regret, when they saw Jim starting out on a journey whose adventures they could not share.  So much for the introduction, now to the narrative. Jim had no time to spare and he could be very prompt when he had to, as all his old friends can well remember. He swung into the black Pullman near the rear of the long train, glided through the narrow alley way between the smoking-room and the side of the car, just missing a head on collision with a stout party coming out of the sleeper. The latter was about to express a haughty indignation at Jim's abrupt approach, but that worthy gave him no chance, as he dashed for section No. 9 at the end of the car. Here he snatched from his valise his belt and revolver and fastened them with rapid precision around his waist, and then with a heavy sweater in his hand, he made a rapid exit from the car.  Already his three minutes were nearly up, and he had an exasperating delay in the narrow passageway where a file of well-fed diners were coming through. As Jim leaped from the platform the engine gave a short, sharp whistle and the wheels began to revolve. Jim's vacation had not made him fat nor short winded and he sped after the engine, with the swiftness of an Indian on the trail of an enemy. Perhaps Bob Ketchel let his engine take it rather slowly. However that may be, Jim in a few seconds was alongside of \"The General Denver\" and then his foot was on the ugly saddle stirrup of iron and he was aboard the engine in a jiffy.  \"Pretty good for a tenderfoot,\" grinned Bob. \"No wonder the Injuns couldn't catch you.\"  \"It's because my feet are so tender that I take them off the ground so fast,\" explained Jim.  The fireman laughed at this and his white teeth shone like a darky's from the sooty grime of his face.  \"You can have my side of the cab,\" he said. \"It's going to keep me busy firing on the upgrade.\"  Jim took his place with a pleasurable feeling of excitement and interest. It was a new experience for him and one he was bound to remember. Already the locomotive was gathering momentum. The little town was left behind in the gathering dusk and soon they were threading their narrow iron way through the solitude of the great mountains. Looking back on a sharp curve, and there were many of them on this mountain grade, Jim could see the crescent form of the coaches all alight, where the passengers were seated at their ease.  Then he looked at the intent, grim-faced, young engineer who never took his eyes from the track ahead, keen and quick to act on the first sign of emergency. \"They certainly are safe with Bob to pilot 'em, lazy beggars,\" said Jim to himself, divided between admiration for his friend and contempt for the ease loving passengers in the sleepers, who would soon turn into their berths in comfort and security, while the engineer would guide his roaring, flaming steed through deep gorges, over dizzy bridges, and down the winding grades from some high divide.  Already the night had fallen and all was darkness except where the light from the locomotive sent its fierce thrust of illumination into the night, straight along the steel rails with sudden, quick thrusts as the \"General Denver\" rounded a curve. \"My but it is great!\" cried Jim with enthusiasm, as on the engine roared into the depths of the mountains. In a short time the moon rose over the crest of the range, shining with a pure brilliance that the work-a-day sun can only dream of.  After several hours of uneventful progress the train ran into a long siding and came to a gentle stop. It was in the center of a wide mountain valley with nothing to indicate human life except a solitary section house, painted a dull red, and, beyond it a short distance, a water tank of the same color.  \"I guess that didn't jar any of those sleeping beauties back there, when I stopped her,\" said Bob quietly, as he stepped down from the cab.  \"Couldn't have done better myself,\" replied Jim whimsically, \"but I would have been tempted to give them a jolt just to make them sit up for a minute.\"  \"Some of the boys do shake 'em up when they feel sort of cranky,\" admitted Ketchel.  \"That's the kind I have always traveled with,\" remarked Jim, \"but what are we waiting here for?\"  \"No. 10 is due in a few minutes. Here's where we oil up.\" Jim watched the operation with interest while the engineer and his fireman went methodically from part to part of the engine with their long billed oil cans.  \"She must be late,\" said Ketchel, looking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20259"],["title","Frontier Boys in Frisco (#1)"],["body","up the track and then at his heavy, open-faced watch. \"What do you suppose is the matter with her? No need of losing time on a night like this,\" he continued.  \"Maybe she has been held up,\" said the fireman.  \"That's more likely to happen to us,\" replied the engineer shortly. \"No. 10 doesn't carry anything but the money the newsboy gets out of the passengers for peanuts and bum dime novels but we have something in that express car that's going to California and it's valuable.\"  \"I'm going to California,\" put in Jim mildly.  \"But you ain't valuable,\" replied the engineer with a grin.  \"Except with this,\" said Jim, putting his hand on his revolver, with a touch of seeming bravado.  \"That's where you come in,\" said the engineer.  \"I thought you weren't giving me a ride just for the fresh air, and to get a view of the 'mountings' by moonlight. But where do you expect these villains to jump you?\" inquired Jim.  \"Well, there are numerous, romantic, little spots along the trail ahead where they might stop us for an interview,\" said Ketchel.  \"I'm thinking they will be a lurking in 'Boxwood Canyon,'\" said Bill Sheehan, the fireman. \"It's the likes of a dirty black gang that will do the deed, the same that shot poor Jimmie McGuire last month because he wouldn't give up his train to 'em, and him with three childer at home.\"  \"There comes 'No. 10.'\" cried Jim, \"and it will be all aboard for Boxwood Canyon.\"  \"Aye, but you have sharp ears, I don't hear anything of her as yet,\" remarked Bill.  \"Him has sharp ears and eyes, Bill!\" exclaimed the engineer. \"That boy there can take the trail with any red Indian and that's the truth.\"     CHAPTER II  A HOLD UP   At that moment there came a glare of light sweeping down the track from the headlight of \"No. 10.\" With a roar and swaying of the big engine, the train rushed down upon them and swept past with its hind heels or wheels kicking up the dust. Then its tail lights of cherry red grew dim way down the valley.  \"All aboard, boys,\" cried Ketchel as No. 10 passed; \"we've got some time to make up.\"  \"He'll stop just short of murder to the train,\" declared the fireman who knew his engineer when it came to a question of picking up a few minutes of time.  \"He will swing her like he used to drive the old stagecoach on the down grade,\" remarked Jim, \"and that will be going some.\"  Already they were gathering speed, as he sent \"The General Denver\" along the level of the valley. In a short time the train came to a steep descent through a narrow canyon, and Jim was in for a new experience. Enured though he was to all kinds of dangers it made him catch his breath when the engine went straight for a wall of solid rock and then turned as though to dash straight from the track, into the brawling stream below.  It righted itself with an effort and leaped down the shining trail rocking from side to side and trembling with the vibrations of its fierce power, dashing straight for the depths of the shadows between the towering cliffs. Little did the sleeping passengers realize the dangers through which they were passing every minute.  \"Gee!\" exclaimed Jim, \"suppose a bowlder has rolled onto the track just ahead. It might happen easy enough too.\"  Just then, Bill Sheehan, the fireman, touched Jim with the end of his shovel to call his attention to something they were coming to ahead. Jim saw a jumbled heap of freight cars half in the stream and half out, and a little ways further on was the rusty ruin of a once powerful locomotive. Jim nodded to the fireman.  \"Something has been doing there,\" he yelled, but the words were blown from his lips and lost in the roar as steam disappears in the air. Jim took a look at his friend, the engineer. He was alert and intent, ready for any emergency, and Jim felt a sense of absolute confidence in his friend's skill. After a ten mile run, the canyon began to broaden out and there were other trees besides the solemn pines. A sense of impending danger came over Jim. He had experienced it many times before and whether it was an ambush of Indians, or the plans of some band of outlaws it had rarely betrayed him. It was something in the air; a vibration that the human nerves are as conscious of as a dog's nose is cognizant of the scent of some wild animal. Jim turned and looked at the engineer, who nodded back at him for a second, with a look that indicated there was business ahead; then his eyes were fastened on the track again.  Jim took out his watch and saw that it was a quarter to two. It brought a quizzical smile to his face. Time and again he had noted the fact that it was just about this time that an attack was sure to come. It sent a thrill through his nerves for he felt that they were rushing straight to a crisis. Much depended on the three men in the engine, for there were many helpless women and children on the train for whose safety they were responsible. Jim noted that the country through which they were going was well suited for the purposes of the bandits desiring to hold up the train.  On either side the walls of the mountains rose at the distance of only a few hundred yards, covered with dark pines and huge rocks showing here and there on the bare fall of some precipice. Between the foot of the mountains and the track was rugged ground, with large bowlders scattered here and there. Clumps of trees and bushes and numerous gullies could be discerned.  It was just the country for a surprise of this kind. Jim stepped down from his narrow seat and got his hands thoroughly warm and pliable, took off his coat and folded it neatly on the seat and stood with his revolver in hand, seeing whether its action was all right. He was a stalwart figure indeed, dressed in his characteristic regimentals, with a thick, tight fitting sweater of blue, pants of the same color, and a new sombrero of a dark hue, for the old one had been battered and worn out of all semblance to a hat, and he was obliged to give it up, though it was like parting with an old friend.  Jim as you remember, perhaps, was a trifle over six feet in height and during his short stay at home he had gained in flesh, so that he weighed one hundred and eighty-five pounds. His hair was brown and straight and his eyes gray. He was doubtless fit for this battle or any that should come his way.  Just at that moment, Bob Ketchel saw an obstruction on the track, about two hundred yards distant, and applied the air brakes instantly. He had been on the watch for just this thing, and noted that there was plenty of cover where the express was halted wherein the desperadoes could hide.  Slowly the panting engine came to a stop with its nose almost against the stone obstruction and there were flashes from a half dozen rifles on either side of \"The General Denver.\" A simultaneous attack was made at the rear of the train.  It was hardly a fair duel but Jim and Bob Ketchel were competent hands at this game and keeping under cover they managed to get in some telling shots. A near bullet sent a splinter from the cab into Jim's cheek, but he paid no attention to it at the time. When he caught a sudden glimpse of two men skulking behind a clump of bushes trying to get a bead on him, he sent two shots straight at them and then ducked into the cab in time to escape a side shot from behind a rock.  He could hear Bob's fusillade from the other side of the cab and the return volleys from the enemy, but he did not worry about his friend, the engineer, for he knew full well that he could take care of himself. It was the other fellows who would have to look out. But Jim saw a figure leap in behind a rock, near the side of the express car, where he would have the drop on Bob.  There was but one thing to do and James did it. He leaped into the tender which made an excellent fort, and there for a few minutes he kept the bandits at bay. He would have laughed heartily at the fireman, Bill Sheehan, if he could have spared the time, for that worthy had taken up the battle in his own way. Having quickly discarded his revolver with which he was not an expert, he began hurling chunks of coal, wherever he saw the flash of the enemy's fire, and filled with fighting fury he exposed himself most recklessly, but with no apparent harm. Whether Bill's novel form of attack made the attacking party helpless with laughter or because he was in such constant motion that it was hard to get a bead on him, be the reason what it may, at least Sheehan came through unscathed.  For a brief time, the battle was even, in fact the engineer and Jim probably had the best of it, and then there came a change in the situation. The party in the rear, saw that their brethren were meeting with a sharp resistance from the engine, so two of them swiftly and stealthily ran along by the side of the train until they came to the baggage car next to the engine.  Slipping in between the two cars they quickly got on top of the baggage. Any noise they might have made being deadened by the firing going on just below. The desperadoes redoubled their attack when they saw two of their number about to turn the fight in their favor, for it was perfectly clear what an advantage their position on the roof of the car would give them.  They could not be hit themselves even if discovered, and it was certain death for Jim and the engineer for they would not be more than thirty feet from the two desperadoes. Even a tenderfoot would not miss at that distance and these men were not in that class. Neither Jim nor Bob Ketchel were standing so that they could catch a glimpse of the two men who were crawling along the top of the blind baggage. At that instant, Bill Sheehan made a rush for the top of the coal pile to get a chunk of ammunition of sufficient size and weight.     CHAPTER III  JIM TAKES A CHANCE   As Sheehan mounted the coal, he caught a glimpse of one of the desperadoes on top of the car and yelled to Ketchel and Jim who jumped just in the nick of time, and by sheer luck not"]]]
