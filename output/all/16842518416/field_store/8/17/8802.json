[Page 23]                                III.—THE GODS OF THE HULA.              Of what nature were the gods of the old times, and how did            the ancient Hawaiians conceive of them? As of beings having            the form, the powers, and the passions of humanity, yet            standing above and somewhat apart from men. One sees, as            through a mist, darkly, a figure, standing, moving; in shape            a plant, a tree or vine-clad stump, a bird, a taloned            monster, a rock carved by the fire-queen, a human form, a            puff of vapor—and now it has given place to vacancy. It was            a goddess, perhaps of the hula. In the solitude of the            wilderness one meets a youthful being of pleasing address, of            godlike wit, of elusive beauty; the charm of her countenance            unspoken authority, her gesture command. She seems one with            nature, yet commanding it. Food placed before her remains            untasted; the oven, _imu_,[22] in which the fascinated host            has heaped his abundance, preparing for a feast, when opened            is found empty; the guest of an hour has disappeared. Again            it was a goddess, perhaps of the hula. Or, again, a traveler            meets a creature of divine beauty, all smiles and loveliness.            The infatuated mortal, smitten with hopeless passion, offers            blandishments; he finds himself by the roadside embracing a            rock. It was a goddess of the hula.             The gods, great and small, superior and inferior, whom the            devotees and practitioners of the hula worshiped and sought            to placate were many; but the goddess Laka was the one to            whom they offered special prayers and sacrifices and to whom            they looked as the patron, the _au-makua_,[23] of that            institution. It was for her benefit and in her honor that the            kuahu was set up, and the wealth of flower and leaf used in            its decoration was emblematic of her beauty and glory, a            pledge of her bodily presence, the very forms that she, a            sylvan deity, was wont to assume when she pleased to manifest            herself.             As an additional crutch to the imagination and to emphasize            the fact of her real presence on the altar which she had been            invoked to occupy as her abode, she was symbolized by an            uncarved block of wood from the sacred _lama_[24] tree. This            was wrapped in a robe of choice yellow tapa, scented with            turmeric, and set conspicuously upon the altar.             [Footnote 22: _Imu_. The Hawaiian oven, which was a hole in            the ground lined and arched over with stones.]             [Footnote 23: _Au-makua_. An ancestral god.]             [Footnote 24: _Lama_. A beautiful tree having firm,            fine-grained, white wood; used in making sacred inclosures            and for other tabu purposes.] [Page 24]            Laka was invoked as the god of the maile, the ie-ie, and            other wildwood growths before mentioned (pl. II). She was            hailed as the “sister, wife, of god Lono,” as “the one who by            striving attained favor with the gods of the upper ether;” as            “the kumu[25] hula”—head teacher of the Terpsichorean art;            “the fount of joy;” “the prophet who brings health to the            sick;” “the one whose presence gives life.” In one of the            prayers to Laka she is besought to come and take possession            of the worshiper, to dwell in him as in a temple, to inspire            him in all his parts and faculties—voice, hands, feet, the            whole body.             Laka seems to have been a friend, but not a relative, of the            numerous Pele family. So far as the author has observed, the            fiery goddess is never invited to grace the altar with her            presence, nor is her name so much as mentioned in any prayer            met with.             To compare the gods of the Hawaiian pantheon with those of            classic Greece, the sphere occupied by Laka corresponds most            nearly to that filled by Terpsichore and Euterpe, the muses,            respectively, of dance and of song. Lono, in one song spoken            of as the husband of Laka, had features in common with            Apollo.             That other gods, Kane, Ku, Kanaloa,[26] with Lono,            Ku-pulupulu,[27] and the whole swarm of godlings that peopled            the wildwood, were also invited to favor the performances            with their presence can be satisfactorily explained on the            ground, first, that all the gods were in a sense members of            one family, related to each other by intermarriage, if not by            the ties of kinship; and, second, by the patent fact of that            great underlying cause of bitterness and strife among            immortals as well as mortals, jealousy. It would have been an            eruptive occasion of heart-burning and scandal if by any            mischance a privileged one should have had occasion to feel            slighted; and to have failed in courtesy to that countless            host of wilderness imps and godlings, the _Kini Akua_,[28]            mischievous and irreverent as the monkeys of India, would            indeed have been to tempt a disaster.             While it is true that the testimony of the various            _kumu-hula_, teachers of the hula, and devotees of the art of            the hula, so far as the author has talked with them, has been            overwhelmingly to the effect that Laka was the one and only            divine patron of the art known to them, there has been a            small number equally ready to assert that there were those            who observed the cult of the goddess Kapo and worshiped her [Page 25]  as the patron of the hula. The positive testimony of these            witnesses must be reckoned as of more weight than the            negative testimony of a much larger number, who either have            not seen or will not look at the other side of the shield. At            any rate, among the prayers before the kuahu, of which there            are others yet to be presented, will be found several            addressed to Kapo as the divine patron of the hula.             [Footnote 25: The teacher, a leader and priest of the hula.            The modern school-master is called _kumu-kula_.]             [Footnote 26: _Kanaloa_.

A general expression—often used            together with the ones that follow—meaning the countless            swarms of brownies, elfs, kobolds, sprites, and other            godlings (mischievous imps) that peopled the wilderness.            _Kini_ means literally 40,000, _lehu_ 400,000, and _mano_            4,000. See the _Pule Kuahu_—altar-prayer—on page 21. The            Hawaiians, curiously enough, did not put the words _mano_,            _kini_, and _lehu_ in the order of their numerical value.]  [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY BULLETIN 38 PLATE III HÁLA-PÉPE (DRACÆNA AUREA) ]             Kapo was sister of Pele and the daughter of Haumea.[29] Among            other roles played by her, like Laka she was at times a            sylvan deity, and it was in the garb of woodland            representations that she was worshiped by hula folk. Her            forms of activity, corresponding to her different            metamorphoses, were numerous, in one of which she was at            times “employed by the _kahuna_[30] as a messenger in their            black arts, and she is claimed by many as an _aumakua_,” [31]            said to be the sister of Kalai-pahoa, the poison god.             [Footnote 29: _Haumea_.

This was, however, only            the hysteria of a moment, not the settled habit of her life.            On one notable occasion, by diverting the attention of the            bestial pig-god Kama-pua’a, and by vividly presenting to him            a temptation well adapted to his gross nature, she succeeded            in enticing him away at a critical moment, and thus rescued            her sister Pele at a time when the latter’s life was            imperiled by an unclean and violent assault from the            swine-god.             Like Catherine of Russia, who in one mood was the patron of            literature and of the arts and sciences and in another mood a            very satyr, so the Hawaiian goddess Kapo seems to have lived            a double life whose aims were at cross purposes with one            another—now an angel of grace and beauty, now a demon of            darkness and lust.             Do we not find in this the counterpart of nature’s twofold            aspect, who presents herself to dependent humanity at one            time as an alma mater, the food-giver, a divinity of joy and            comfort, at another time as the demon of the storm and            earthquake, a plowshare of fiery destruction?             The name of Hiiaka, the sister of Pele, is one often            mentioned in the prayers of the hula. [Page 26]                        IV.—SUPPORT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE HULA              In ancient times the hula to a large extent was a creature of            royal support, and for good reason. The actors in this            institution were not producers of life’s necessaries. To the            _alii_ belonged the land and the sea and all the useful            products thereof. Even the jetsam whale-tooth and wreckage            scraps of iron that ocean cast up on the shore were claimed            by the lord of the land. Everything was the king’s. Thus it            followed of necessity that the support of the hula must in            the end rest upon the alii. As in ancient Rome it was a            senator or general, enriched by the spoil of a province, who            promoted the sports of the arena, so in ancient Hawaii it was            the chief or headman of the district who took the initiative            in the promotion of the people’s communistic sports and of            the hula.             We must not imagine that the hula was a thing only of kings’            courts and chiefish residences. It had another and democratic            side. The passion for the hula was broadspread. If other            agencies failed to meet the demand, there was nothing to            prevent a company of enthusiasts from joining themselves            together in the pleasures and, it might be, the profits of            the hula. Their spokesman—designated as the _po’o-puaa_,            from the fact that a pig, or a boar’s head, was required of            him as an offering at the kuahu—was authorized to secure the            services of some expert to be their kumu. But with the hula            all roads lead to the king’s court.             Let us imagine a scene at the king’s residence. The alii,            rousing from his sloth and rubbing his eyes, rheumy with            debauch and _awa_, overhears remark on the doings of a new            company of hula dancers who have come into the neighborhood.            He summons his chief steward.             “What is this new thing of which they babble?” he demands.             “It is nothing, son of heaven,” answers the kneeling steward.             “They spoke of a hula. Tell me, what is it?”             “Ah, thou heaven-born (_lani_), it was but a trifle—a new            company, young graduates of the halau, have set themselves up            as great ones; mere rustics; they have no proper acquaintance            with the traditions of the art as taught by the bards of...            your majesty’s father. They mouth and twist the old songs            all awry, thou son of heaven.”             “Enough. I will hear them to-morrow. Send a messenger for            this new kumu. Fill again my bowl with awa.” [Page 27]            Thus it comes about that the new hula company gains audience            at court and walks the road that, perchance, leads to            fortune. Success to the men and women of the hula means not            merely applause, in return for the incense of flattery; it            means also a shower of substantial favors—food, garments,            the smile of royalty, perhaps land—things that make life a            festival. If welcome grows cold and it becomes evident that            the harvest has been reaped, they move on to fresh woods and            pastures new.             To return from this apparent digression, it was at the king’s            court—if we may extend the courtesy of this phrase to a            group of thatched houses—that were gathered the bards and            those skilled in song, those in whose memories were stored            the mythologies, traditions, genealogies, proverbial wisdom,            and poetry that, warmed by emotion, was the stuff from which            was spun the songs of the hula. As fire is produced by            friction, so it was often by the congress of wits rather than            by the flashing of genius that the songs of the hula were            evolved.             The composition and criticism of a poetical passage were a            matter of high importance, often requiring many suggestions            and much consultation. If the poem was to be a _mele-inoa_, a            name-song to eulogize some royal or princely scion, it must            contain no word of ill-omen. The fate-compelling power of            such a word, once shot from the mouth, was beyond recall.            Like the incantation of the sorcerer, the _kahuna ánaaná_, it            meant death to the eulogized one. If not, it recoiled on the            life of the singer.             The verbal form once settled, it remained only to stereotype            it on the memories of the men and women who constituted the            literary court or conclave. Think not that only thus were            poems produced in ancient Hawaii. The great majority of songs            were probably the fruit of solitary inspiration, in which the            bard poured out his heart like a song-bird, or uttered his            lone vision as a seer. The method of poem production in            conclave may be termed the official method. It was often done            at the command of an alii. So much for the fabrication, the            weaving, of a song.             If the composition was intended as a eulogy, it was            cantillated ceremoniously before the one it honored; if in            anticipation of a prince yet unborn, it was daily recited            before the mother until the hour of her delivery; and this            cantillation published it abroad. If the song was for            production in the hula, it lay warm in the mind of the kumu,            the master and teacher of the hula, until such time as he had            organized his company.             The court of the alii was a vortex that drew in not only the            bards and men of lore, but the gay and fashionable rout of            pleasure-seekers, the young men and women of shapely form and            gracious presence, the sons and daughters of the king’s [Page 28]  henchmen and favorites; among them, perhaps, the offspring of            the king’s morganatic alliances and amours—the flower and            pick of Hawaii’s youth. From these the kumu selected those            most fitted by beauty and grace of form, as well as quickness            of wit and liveliness of imagination, to take part in the            hula.             The performers in the hula were divided into two classes, the            _olapa_—agile ones—and the _ho’o-paa_—steadfast ones. The            rôle of olapa, as was fitting, was assigned to the young men            and young women who could best illustrate in their persons            the grace and beauty of the human form. It was theirs,            sometimes while singing, to move and pose and gesture in the            dance; sometimes also to punctuate their song and action with            the lighter instruments of music. The rôle of ho’o-paa, on            the other hand, was given to men and women of greater            experience and of more maturity. They handled the heavier            instruments and played their parts mostly while sitting or            kneeling, marking the time with their instrumentation. They            also lent their voices to swell the chorus or utter the            refrain of certain songs, sometimes taking the lead in the            song or bearing its whole burden, while the light-footed            olapa gave themselves entirely to the dance. The part of the            ho’o-paa was indeed the heavier, the more exacting duty.             Such was the personnel of a hula troupe when first gathered            by the hula-master for training and drill in the halau, now            become a school for the hula. Among the pupils the kumu was            sure to find some old hands at the business, whose presence,            like that of veterans in a squad of recruits, was a leaven to            inspire the whole company with due respect for the spirit and            traditions of the historic institution and to breed in the            members the patience necessary to bring them to the highest            proficiency.             The instruction of the kumu, as we are informed, took a wide            range. It dealt in elaborate detail on such matters as            accent, inflection, and all that concerns utterance and            vocalization. It naturally paid great attention to gesture    "]]]
