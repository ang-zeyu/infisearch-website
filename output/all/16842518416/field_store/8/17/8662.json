MINIMUM WASTE.   The United States Fuel Administration is making every effort, through the producers and transportation lines, to obtain an adequate supply of fuel for the industries of the country.  Twenty-five to fifty million tons of coal a year can be saved by the improved operation of steam-power plants without changing their present equipment and without abating their production the slightest.  It is absolutely necessary that this saving be realized, if our overburdened railroads are to be relieved and our industries kept in full operation.  The extent to which it will be realized depends upon the cooperation of the owners, engineers, and firemen of every power plant of the country.  YOUR FIRING LINE IS AT THE FURNACE DOOR.                                          DAVID MOFFAT MYERS,      _Advisory Engineer to United States Fuel Administration_.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     BOILER AND FURNACE TESTING.  By RUFUS T. STROHM.   NECESSITY FOR TESTING BOILERS.  A boiler test is necessary in order to determine how well the boiler is doing the work expected of it; that is to say, we must find out whether we are wasting coal in making steam and how much this waste may be. Such a test may be made to discover the efficiency of the boiler, or the quantity of water it is evaporating, or the cost of evaporating 1,000 pounds of water.  The United States Fuel Administration recommends that every boiler plant have some means of daily checking the efficiency of the boiler and furnace. The simplest and best way of finding out how efficiently the boiler is working is to make an evaporation test, as described in this bulletin. All the necessary records can be made automatically with suitable instruments, although in many small plants the coal must be weighed on ordinary scales. The efficiency of the furnace can be found by making analyses of the flue gases. (See Bulletin No. 2 of the United States Fuel Administration.)  Too many engineers and firemen have the idea that they are not fitted to make boiler tests. This is altogether wrong. Any man who can weigh water and coal and read steam gages and thermometers is able to do the work required in making a boiler test for evaporation or efficiency. Such a test requires a knowledge of the following:    1. The total weight of coal used.    2. [1]The total weight of water fed to and evaporated by the   boiler.    3. The average temperature of the feed water.    4. The average steam pressure in the boiler.  If these four items are known, a series of simple calculations will show how much water is being evaporated per pound of coal, and the efficiency of the boiler and furnace.  To make a test, the following apparatus and instruments are necessary:    1. Scales to weigh the coal.    2. Apparatus to weigh or measure the feed water.    3. Thermometers to take feed-water temperature.    4. Gages to indicate steam pressure.  A boiler test to be of value should extend over a period of at least eight hours. The longer the test the more accurate the results.  [Footnote 1: For the sake of simplicity, only the essential elements of boiler and furnace testing are treated in this bulletin. For rules covering the refinements for an exhaustive test, the reader is referred to the boiler test code of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Copies of this code can be obtained from the secretary, 29 West Thirty-ninth Street, New York City.]   WEIGHING THE COAL.  The weight of coal used during a test may easily be found by using an ordinary wheelbarrow and a platform scales, arranged as in figure 1. At each side of the scales build an incline with its top level with the top of the platform, but take care not to have either one touch the platform. Set the empty wheelbarrow on the scales, run the movable weight or poise out until it exactly balances the weight of the barrow and lock it in position with the thumbscrew.  Next, put weights on the scale pan _A_ to correspond to a net weight of 250 or 300 pounds of coal. Fill the barrow with coal, run it on the scales, and add coal or take off coal until the scales balance. This is easily done by having a small pile of coal _B_ beside the scales. If the weights on the scale pan represent, say, 300 pounds, the net weight of coal in the barrow is exactly 300 pounds. This coal is wheeled in front of the boiler and dumped on the clean floor, and the barrow is returned for another load.  [Illustration: _Fig. 1._  1 _Set to balance tare of wheelbarrow_ 2 _Add to balance net weight of coal_]  Each time the barrow of coal is weighed on the scales and taken to the boiler being tested, a tally mark should be made on a board nailed to the wall beside the scales. Each tally mark represents 300 pounds of coal, since the amount of coal in the barrow is adjusted at each weighing, so that the scales just balance. At the end of the test, therefore, the number of tally marks is multiplied by 300, and the product is the weight of coal used, provided it has all been fired; but if any coal remains in front of the boiler at the close of the test, it must be gathered up and weighed, and its weight must be subtracted from the total weight indicated by the tally marks to get the number of pounds of coal actually fired. You should, of course, start the test with no coal in front of the boiler.  Care must be taken not to forget to make a tally mark each time a barrow of coal is run off the scales. By setting the scales so as to show any net weight, such as 250 or 300 pounds, and making each barrow load exactly this weight, much time is saved, as it is unnecessary to change any of the weights or the position of the rider on the scale beam.  If the coal used in the test is to be analyzed, take a sample of from 4 to 6 pounds from each barrow and throw it into a box near the scales. Do this _before_ the coal is weighed. These small amounts from the various barrow loads will then give a fair average sample of the coal used during the test.  The condition of the furnace should be the same at the end of the test period as at the start. Therefore, at the moment the test is begun, observe the thickness of the fuel bed and the condition of the fire. If the fire was cleaned, say, an hour before the test began, see that it is cleaned an hour before the time when the test is scheduled to end. If the coal was fired, say, eight minutes before the test started, the last coal used during the test should be fired eight minutes before the end of the test. The object of these precautions is to insure the same conditions at start and finish, as nearly as possible; otherwise, the coal weighed will not be the same as the coal consumed.   MEASURING THE FEED WATER.  The quantity of water fed to the boiler during the test may be found by metering or by weighing. A reliable water meter is recommended for this work. There are a number of good makes, of different types, such as:    1. Venturi meter.    2. Weir or V-notch meters.    3. Diaphragm meters.    4. Displacement meters.    5. Water weighers.  The best form of meter to use in any particular case depends on the local conditions in the plant; but _every plant should be provided with a permanently installed meter of some type_. The displacement form of meter should be used only with cold water, however.  If there is no meter or water weigher in the plant, the feed water used during the test can be measured by the three-barrel arrangement illustrated in figure 2.  Obtain three water-tight barrels, and set two of them close together on a platform directly over the third, leaving about 12 inches above barrel 3 in which to fit the valves _V_ and the nipples in the bottoms of barrels 1 and 2. Near the top of each of the barrels 1 and 2 screw a 1-inch overflow pipe _O_.  Run a pipe _P_ from the city main or other source of supply above barrels 1 and 2, and put a valve _A_ on the pipe leading to each barrel. From barrel 3 run a suction pipe to the feed pump that is to pump water to the boiler to be tested. It is best to have a by-pass from the usual water supply direct to the feed pump, or to another pump connected to the boiler, so that in case of any trouble with the testing barrels, the regular operation of the boiler may be resumed without shutting down.  The next step is to fill barrels 1 and 2 with water until they overflow at _O_. This water should be of practically the same average temperature as that which is to be used during the test. Barrel 3 should be high enough above the feed pump so that the pump will handle hot water. Put barrel 3 on a scales, before connecting it to the feed pump, and weigh it. Then let the water from barrel 1 run into barrel 3, and weigh again. The second weight minus the first weight is the net weight of water run in from barrel 1 and is the weight of water contained in barrel 1 when filled to the overflow. The weight of water in barrel 2 when it is filled to the overflow can be found in like manner. Mark these weights down.  [Illustration: _Fig. 2._]  When the net weights are found and barrel 3 is removed from the scales and connected to the feed pump, the apparatus is ready to begin the test. Start with the level of the water about 1 foot below the top of the barrel 3, and drive a nail into the barrel to mark this level. When the test is finished, the level should be brought to the same point, so that the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20146"],["title","Engineering Bulletin No 1: Boiler and Furnace Testing (#1)"],["body","that has passed through barrels 1 and 2 will accurately represent the weight of water fed to the boiler during the test.  When the test is to begin, stop the feed pump and tie a string around the gage glass on the boiler to mark the height of the water level in the boiler. Then start the pump connected to barrel 3. Fill barrels 1 and 2 up to the overflow before the test is started. Then open the valve _V_ on barrel 1 and let the water run into barrel 3 as fast as the feed pump draws water from barrel 3. When barrel 1 is emptied close its valve _V_ and open its valve _A_ so as to refill it.  While barrel 1 is filling empty barrel 2 into barrel 3 in the same way, and continue to fill and empty barrels 1 and 2 alternately. In this way barrel 3 will be kept supplied with water that has been measured in barrels 1 and 2, the net weights of which were found before the test began. Keep a separate tally of the number of times each of the barrels 1 and 2 is emptied into barrel 3. At the end of the test the number of tallies for each barrel multiplied by the weight of the water that barrel will hold will be the weight of water measured in that barrel. The sum of these weights for barrels 1 and 2 will be the weight of water used in the test.  With a three-barrel arrangement like this, water can be weighed rapidly enough to supply 300 boiler horsepower.  Before starting a test make sure that there is no chance for water to leak into or out of the boiler. See that the blow-off is tight, that there is no drip from gage cocks, and that the feed-line connections are tight, so that all the water fed to the boiler will represent accurately the amount evaporated during the test.  If a meter is used instead of the three-barrel method, make absolutely sure that the meter is correct, as the accuracy of the test depends on the accuracy with which the water measurements are made. _After a meter is installed, test it to see that it operates correctly under the plant conditions._  The water level in the boiler should be the same at the end of the test as at the beginning. As the time for stopping the test draws near, therefore, try to bring the conditions the same as at the start. Do not, however, run the feed pump rapidly in the last few minutes for the test in order to obtain the same water level. If there is a slight difference in level, calculate the weight of water it represents and make the necessary correction to the total weight of water fed.   TEMPERATURE OF FEED WATER.  Every plant should have a thermometer on the feed line, so as to find the temperature of the feed water. Preferably, this thermometer should be of the recording type. If such a form of thermometer is used during the test, it is unnecessary to take the feed temperature at stated intervals, as the record will show the varying temperatures, and so the average feed temperature during the test can easily be found.  If there is no thermometer in the feed line, take the feed-water temperature by means of a thermometer hung in barrel 3 (figure 2) by a hook over the edge of the barrel. Read this thermometer every half hour during the test if the feed-water temperature is fairly uniform; but if it varies considerably, read the thermometer every 15 minutes. The object is to obtain the average feed-water temperature during the test period. Therefore, mark down the temperatures as read at the stated intervals. At the close of the test add the readings and divide their sum by the number of readings and you will have the average temperature of the feed water.   STEAM PRESSURE.  Every boiler is fitted with a steam gage by which the pressure is indicated. It is important that the pressure gage be accurate. What is wanted in a test is the average pressure of the steam in the boiler, therefore, observe the pressure at regular intervals, just as with the feed-water temperature, and mark down these gage readings. The sum of the readings divided by the number of readings taken will be the average steam pressure during the test.  A recording steam gage is best and makes its own readings.   WORKING UP THE TEST.  After the boiler test has been made, so as to find the weight of coal burned, weight of feed water used, feed-water temperature and steam pressure, the efficiency, the horsepower, and the economy must be obtained by calculation from the test results. The process of figuring the desired results from the test data is called \"working up the test.\"  To illustrate the method used in finding the efficiency, etc., suppose that the data obtained from the test are as follows:    Length of test                                       hours      10   Total weight of coal fired                          pounds   5,000   Total weight of water evaporated                       do.  35,000   Average temperature of feed water                       °F     180   Average steam pressure, gage        pounds per square inch     100  The efficiency of any process is always a comparison, or ratio, of the output to the input. In the case of a steam boiler the efficiency is the percentage of the heat supplied in the coal that is usefully employed in making steam. The output of the steam boiler is the heat represented by the quantity of water evaporated by a pound of coal, taking into account the feed temperature and the steam pressure, and input is the amount of heat contained in a pound of the coal used. The efficiency of the boiler is the output divided by the input.  The heat contained in a pound of coal is called the \"calorific value\" or \"heating value\" of the coal. It can be found by taking a fair average sample of the coal used during the test, as explained in connection with weighing the coal, and sending the sample to a chemist, who will make a calorimeter test to determine its heating value.  At the end of the test the sample fuel should be spread out on a clean floor and all lumps broken up, so that no pieces are larger than 2 inches maximum diameter. Then the gross sample should be very thoroughly mixed by shoveling, after which it should be spread out in the form of a square of uniform depth and quartered down until a final average sample is obtained for shipment to a competent chemist, experienced in fuel analysis. (See Bureau of Mines Technical Paper No. 133.)  About 2 quarts of the chemist's sample should be put in air-tight tins or jars for the determination of moisture; the balance of the sample (the total weight of which should be from 10 to 50 pounds, depending on the total weight of coal used in the test) may be packed in a wooden box lined with paper to prevent splinters from mingling with the sample. A duplicate coal sample should be kept at the plant to be used in case of loss of the sample sent to the chemist.  The Bureau of Mines has published a bulletin or pamphlet giving the analyses and heating values of the various kinds and grades of coal from all parts of the United States. (Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 22.) This bulletin can be used to learn the approximate heating value of the coal. Simply find out what district the coal used in the test came from, and its grade, and then refer to the bulletin to obtain the heating value of the coal. If a chemist can be obtained to make a heat test, however, it is better to use the heating value he determines.  Suppose that during the test the coal used was run-of-mine bituminous having a heating value of 13,500 B. t. u. Every pound of coal fired, then, carried into the furnace 13,500 heat units, and this value therefore is the _input_ to be used in calculating the boiler efficiency.  During the test 5,000 pounds of coal was fired and 35,000 pounds of water was fed and evaporated. This means that 35,000 ÷ 5,000 = 7 pounds of water was evaporated per pound of coal burned. This is the \"actual evaporation,\" and the heat required to evaporate this 7 pounds of water is the output to be used in calculating the efficiency.  Every fireman knows that it takes more coal, and therefore more heat, to make steam with cold feed water than with hot feed water; also, that it is somewhat easier to make steam at a low pressure than at a high pressure. So it is plain that the heat required to evaporate 7 pounds of water into steam depends on two things, namely, (1) the temperature of the feed water and (2) the pressure of the steam in the boiler. From the data of the test, both the average feed-water temperature and the average steam pressure are known, and so it is a simple matter to find out the amount of heat needed to evaporate 7 pounds of water from the average temperature to steam at the average pressure.  A pound of water at 212° F. must have 970.4 B. t. u. added to it to become a pound of steam at 212° F., or zero gage pressure. This value, 970.4 B. t. u., is called the latent heat of steam at atmospheric pressure, or the heat \"from and at 212° F.\" It is the heat required to change a pound of water _from_ 212° F. to steam _at_ 212° F., and is used by engineers as a standard by which to compare the evaporation of different boilers.  In a boiler test the temperature of the feed water is usually something less than 212° F., and the steam pressure is commonly higher than zero, gage. In the test outlined previously, the feed-water temperature was 180° F. and the pressure was 100 pounds per square inch, gage. It must be clear, then, that the amount of heat required to change a pound of water at 180° to steam at 100 pounds gage pressure is not the same as to make a pound of steam from and at 212° F.  To make allowance for the differences in temperature and pressure, the actual evaporation must be multiplied by a number called the \"factor of evaporation.\" The factor of evaporation has a certain value corresponding to every feed-water temperature and boiler pressure, and the values of this factor are given in the accompanying table. Along the top of the table are given the gage pressures of the steam. In the columns at the sides of the table are given the "]]]
