[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],["title","Piccadilly Jim (#8)"],["body",", Mr. Pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been elsewhere at that moment. Such was the agitated state of his mind that, when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about to follow his wife into the room, he started so violently that his hat flew out of his hand. He turned to meet the eyes of the butler who had admitted him to the house, fixed on his in an appealing stare.  \"Who's leading in the pennant race?\" said this strange butler in a feverish whisper.  It was a question, coming from such a source, which in another than Mr. Pett might well have provoked a blank stare of amazement. Such, however, is the almost superhuman intelligence and quickness of mind engendered by the study of America's national game that he answered without the slightest hesitation.  \"Giants!\"  \"Wow!\" said the butler.  No sense of anything strange or untoward about the situation came to mar the perfect joy of Mr. Pett, the overmastering joy of the baseball fan who in a strange land unexpectedly encounters a brother. He thrilled with a happiness which he had never hoped to feel that morning.  \"No signs of them slumping?\" enquired the butler.  \"No. But you never can tell. It's early yet. I've seen those boys lead the league till the end of August and then be nosed out.\"  \"True enough,\" said the butler sadly.  \"Matty's in shape.\"  \"He is? The old souper working well?\"  \"Like a machine. He shut out the Cubs the day before I sailed!\"  \"Fine!\"  At this point an appreciation of the unusualness of the proceedings began to steal upon Mr. Pett. He gaped at this surprising servitor.  \"How on earth do you know anything about baseball?\" he demanded.  The other seemed to stiffen. A change came over his whole appearance. He had the air of an actor who has remembered his part.  \"I beg your pardon, sir. I trust I have not taken a liberty. I was at one time in the employment of a gentleman in New York, and during my stay I became extremely interested in the national game. I picked up a few of the American idioms while in the country.\" He smiled apologetically. \"They sometimes slip out.\"  \"Let 'em slip!\" said Mr. Pett with enthusiasm. \"You're the first thing that's reminded me of home since I left. Say!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Got a good place here?\"  \"Er--oh, yes, sir.\"  \"Well, here's my card. If you ever feel like making a change, there's a job waiting for you at that address.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\" Mr. Crocker stooped.  \"Your hat, sir.\"  He held it out, gazing fondly at it the while. It was like being home again to see a hat like that. He followed Mr. Pett as he went into the morning-room with an affectionate eye.  Bayliss was coming along the hall, hurrying more than his wont. The ring at the front door had found him deep in an extremely interesting piece of news in his halfpenny morning paper, and he was guiltily aware of having delayed in answering it.  \"Bayliss,\" said Mr. Crocker in a cautious undertone, \"go and tell Mrs. Crocker that Mrs. Pett is waiting to see her. She's in the morning-room. If you're asked, say you let her in. Get me?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Bayliss, grateful for this happy solution.  \"Oh, Bayliss!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Is the wicket at Lord's likely to be too sticky for them to go on with that game to-day?\"  \"I hardly think it probable that there will be play, sir. There was a great deal of rain in the night.\"  Mr. Crocker passed on to his den with a lighter heart.              *       *       *       *       *  It was Mrs. Crocker's habit, acquired after years of practice and a sedulous study of the best models, to conceal beneath a mask of well-bred indifference any emotion which she might chance to feel. Her dealings with the aristocracy of England had shown her that, while the men occasionally permitted themselves an outburst, the women never did, and she had schooled herself so rigorously that nowadays she seldom even raised her voice. Her bearing, as she approached the morning-room was calm and serene, but inwardly curiosity consumed her. It was unbelievable that Nesta could have come to try to effect a reconciliation, yet she could think of no other reason for her visit.  She was surprised to find three persons in the morning-room. Bayliss, delivering his message, had mentioned only Mrs. Pett. To Mrs. Crocker the assemblage had the appearance of being a sort of Old Home Week of Petts, a kind of Pett family mob-scene. Her sister's second marriage having taken place after their quarrel, she had never seen her new brother-in-law, but she assumed that the little man lurking in the background was Mr. Pett. The guess was confirmed.  \"Good morning, Eugenia,\" said Mrs. Pett.  \"Peter, this is my sister, Eugenia. My husband.\"  Mrs. Crocker bowed stiffly. She was thinking how hopelessly American Mr. Pett was, how baggy his clothes looked, what absurdly shaped shoes he wore, how appalling his hat was, how little hair he had and how deplorably he lacked all those graces of repose, culture, physical beauty, refinement, dignity, and mental alertness which raise men above the level of the common cock-roach.  Mr. Pett, on his side, receiving her cold glance squarely between the eyes, felt as if he were being disembowelled by a clumsy amateur. He could not help wondering what sort of a man this fellow Crocker was whom this sister-in-law of his had married. He pictured him as a handsome, powerful, robust individual with a strong jaw and a loud voice, for he could imagine no lesser type of man consenting to link his lot with such a woman. He sidled in a circuitous manner towards a distant chair, and, having lowered himself into it, kept perfectly still, pretending to be dead, like an opossum. He wished to take no part whatever in the coming interview.  \"Ogden, of course, you know,\" said Mrs. Pett.  She was sitting so stiffly upright on a hard chair and had so much the appearance of having been hewn from the living rock that every time she opened her mouth it was as if a statue had spoken.  \"I know Ogden,\" said Mrs. Crocker shortly. \"Will you please stop him fidgeting with that vase? It is valuable.\"  She directed at little Ogden, who was juggling aimlessly with a handsome _objet d'art_ of the early Chinese school, a glance similar to that which had just disposed of his step-father. But Ogden required more than a glance to divert him from any pursuit in which he was interested. He shifted a deposit of candy from his right cheek to his left cheek, inspected Mrs. Crocker for a moment with a pale eye, and resumed his juggling. Mrs. Crocker meant nothing in his young life.  \"Ogden, come and sit down,\" said Mrs. Pett.  \"Don't want to sit down.\"  \"Are you making a long stay in England, Nesta?\" asked Mrs. Crocker coldly.  \"I don't know. We have made no plans.\"  \"Indeed?\"  She broke off. Ogden, who had possessed himself of a bronze paper-knife, had begun to tap the vase with it. The ringing note thus produced appeared to please his young mind.  \"If Ogden really wishes to break that vase,\" said Mrs. Crocker in a detached voice, \"let me ring for the butler to bring him a hammer.\"  \"Ogden!\" said Mrs. Pett.  \"Oh Gee! A fellow can't do a thing!\" muttered Ogden, and walked to the window. He stood looking out into the square, a slight twitching of the ears indicating that he still made progress with the candy.  \"Still the same engaging child!\" murmured Mrs. Crocker.  \"I did not come here to discuss Ogden!\" said Mrs. Pett.  Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows. Not even Mrs. Otho Lanners, from whom she had learned the art, could do it more effectively.  \"I am still waiting to find out why you did come, Nesta!\"  \"I came here to talk to you about your step-son, James Crocker.\"  The discipline to which Mrs. Crocker had subjected herself in the matter of the display of emotion saved her from the humiliation of showing surprise. She waved her hand graciously--in the manner of the Duchess of Axminster, a supreme hand-waver--to indicate that she was all attention.  \"Your step-son, James Crocker,\" repeated Mrs. Pett. \"What is it the New York papers call him, Peter?\"  Mr. Pett, the human opossum, came to life. He had contrived to create about himself such a defensive atmosphere of non-existence that now that he re-entered the conversation it was as if a corpse had popped out of its tomb like a jack-in-the-box.  Obeying the voice of authority, he pushed the tombstone to one side and poked his head out of the sepulchre.  \"Piccadilly Jim!\" he murmured apologetically.  \"Piccadilly Jim!\" said Mrs. Crocker. \"It is extremely impertinent of them!\"  In spite of his misery, a wan smile appeared on Mr. Pett's death-mask at this remark.  \"They should worry about--!\"  \"Peter!\"  Mr. Pett died again, greatly respected.  \"Why should the New York papers refer to James at all?\" said Mrs. Crocker.  \"Explain, Peter!\"  Mr. Pett emerged reluctantly from the cerements. He had supposed that Nesta would do the talking.  \"Well, he's a news-item.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, here's a boy that's been a regular fellow--raised in America--done work on a newspaper--suddenly taken off to England to become a London dude--mixing with all the dukes, playing pinochle with the King--naturally they're interested in him.\"  A more agreeable expression came over Mrs. Crocker's face.  \"Of course, that is quite true. One cannot prevent the papers from printing what they wish. So they have published articles about James' doings in English Society?\"  \"Doings,\" said Mr. Pett, \"is right!\"  \"Something has got to be done about it,\" said Mrs. Pett.  Mr. Pett endorsed this.  \"Nesta's going to lose her health if these stories go on,\" he said.  Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows, but she had hard work to keep a contented smile off her face.  \"If you are not above petty jealousy, Nesta . . .\"  Mrs. Pett laughed a sharp, metallic laugh.  \"It is the disgrace I object to!\"  \"The disgrace!\"  \"What else would you call it, Eugenia? Wouldn't you be ashamed if you opened your Sunday paper and came upon a full page article about your nephew"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20053"],["title","The Rover Boys in the Air; Or, From College Campus to the Clouds (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

THE ROUND-UP--CONCLUSION     INTRODUCTION   MY DEAR BOYS: This is a complete story in itself, but forms the sixteenth volume issued under the general title of \"Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  This line was started thirteen years ago by the publication of the first three volumes, \"The Rover Boys at School,\" \"On the Ocean,\" and \"In the Jungle.\" I hoped that the young people would like the stories, but I was hardly prepared for the very warm welcome the volumes received. The three books were followed by a fourth, \"The Rover Boys Out West,\" and then, yearly, by \"On the Great Lakes,\" \"In Camp,\" \"On Land and Sea,\" \"On the River,\" \"On the Plains,\" \"In Southern Waters,\" \"On the Farm,\" \"On Treasure Isle,\" \"At College,\" and then by \"Down East,\" where we last left our heroes and their friends.  Of course, as is but natural, Dick, Tom and Sam are older than when we first met them. Indeed, Dick is thinking of getting married and settling down, and with such a nice girl as Dora Stanhope, who could blame him? All of the boys are at college, finishing their education, and all are as wideawake as ever, and Tom is just as full of merriment. They have some strenuous times, and take a trip through the air that is a good deal out of the ordinary. They meet some of their old enemies, and prove that they are heroes in the best meaning of that much-abused term.  The publishers report a sale of this series of books of _over a million copies_! This is truly amazing to me, and again, as in the past, I thank my many young friends for their cordial reception of what I have written for them. I trust the present story will interest them and prove of benefit.  Affectionately and sincerely yours,  ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.     THE ROVER BOYS IN THE AIR     CHAPTER I  THE BOYS AND THE BIPLANE   \"Fo' de land sakes, Massa Dick, wot am dat contraption yo' boys dun put togedder back ob de bahn yesterday?\"  \"Why, Aleck, don't you know what that is?\" returned Dick Rover, with a smile at the colored man. \"That's a biplane.\"  \"A biplane, eh?\" repeated Alexander Pop, the colored helper around the Rover homestead. He scratched his woolly head thoughtfully. \"Yo' don't mean to say it am lak a plane a carpenter man uses, does yo', Massa Dick? 'Pears lak to me it was moah lak some ship sails layin' down,--somethin' lak dem ships we see over in Africy, when we went into dem jungles to find yo' fadder.\"  \"No, it has nothing to do with a carpenter's plane, Aleck,\" answered Dick, with a laugh. \"A biplane is a certain kind of a flying machine.\"  \"Wat's dat? A flyin' machine? Shorely, Massa Dick, yo' ain't gwine to try to fly?\" exclaimed Aleck, in horror.  \"That is just what I am going to do, Aleck, after I have had a few lessons. I hope to fly right over the house, just like a bird.\"  \"No! no! Don't you try dat, Massa Dick! You'll break yo' neck suah! Don't yo' try it! I--I can't allow it nohow--an' yo' aunt won't allow it neither!\" And the colored man shook his head most emphatically.  \"Now, don't get excited, Aleck,\" said Dick, calmly. \"I won't go up until I am sure of what I am doing. Why, don't you know that flying in the air is getting to be a common thing these days? Tom and Sam and I bought that biplane in New York last week, and a man who knows all about flying is coming out to the farm to teach us how to run it. After we know how to sail through the air we'll take you up with us.\"  \"Me!\" ejaculated the colored man, and rolled his eyes wildly. \"Not in a thousand years, Massa Dick, an' not fo' all dat treasure yo' dun brung home from Treasure Isle! No, sah, de ground am good enough fo' Aleck Pop!\" And he backed away, as if afraid Dick Rover might carry him off then and there.  \"Hello, Aleck!\" cried a merry voice at this moment, and Tom Rover came into view. \"Want to take a sail through the clouds for a change?\"  \"Massa Tom, am yo' really thinking ob goin' up in dat contraption?\" demanded the colored man, earnestly.  \"Sure thing, Aleck. And you'll want to go, too, before long. Think of flying along like a bird!\" And Tom Rover spread out his arms and moved them slowly up and down. \"Oh, it's grand!\"  \"Yo' won't be no bird when yo' come down ker-flop!\" murmured Aleck, soberly. \"Yo' will be all busted up, dat's wot yo'll be!\"  \"We won't fall, don't you worry,\" continued Tom. \"This biplane is a first-class machine, warranted in all kinds of weather.\"  \"If it am a flyin' machine wot fo' you call it a biplane?\" asked the colored man curiously.  \"Bi stands for two,\" explained Dick. \"A bicycle means two cycles, or two wheels. A biplane means two planes, or two surfaces of canvas. This biplane of ours, as you can see, has two surfaces, or decks, an upper and a lower. A monoplane has only one plane, and a triplane has three. Now you understand, don't you, Aleck?\"  \"I dun reckon I do, Massa Dick. But look yeah, boys, yo' take my advice an' don't yo' try to sail frough de air in dat bicycleplane, or wot yo' call it. 'Tain't safe nohow! Yo' stick to de hosses, an' dat autermobile, an' de boat on de ribber. A boy wasn't meant to be a bird nohow!\"  \"How about being an angel, Aleck?\" asked Tom, slyly.  \"Huh! An angel, eh? Well, if yo' go up in dat bicycleplane maybe yo' will be an angel after yo' fall out, even if yo' ain't one when yo' starts.\" And with this remark Aleck Pop hurried away to his work in the house.  \"That's one on you, Tom,\" cried Dick, with a broad smile. \"Poor Aleck! he evidently has no use for flying machines.\"  \"Well, Dick, now the machine is together, it does look rather scary,\" answered Tom Rover, slowly. \"I want to see that aviator try it out pretty well before I risk my neck going up.\"  \"Oh, so do I. And we'll have to have a good many lessons in running the engine, and in steering, and all that. I begin to think running a flying machine is a good deal harder than running an auto, or a motor boat.\"  \"Yes, I guess it is. Come on down and let us see how the engine works. We can do that easily enough, for it's a good deal like the engine of an auto, or a motor boat,\" went on Tom.  \"Where is Sam?\"  \"He took the auto and went down to the Corners on an errand for Aunt Martha. He said he'd be back as soon as possible. He's as crazy to get at the biplane as either of us.\"  The two boys walked to where the biplane had been put together, in a large open wagon shed attached to the rear of the big barn. The biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet, and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it. There was a rudder in front and another behind, and in the centre was a broad cane seat, with a steering wheel, and several levers for controlling the craft. Back of the seat was the engine, lightly built but powerful, and above was a good-sized tank of gasoline. The framework of the biplane was of bamboo, held together by stays of piano wire, and the planes themselves were of canvas, especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite air proof. All told, the machine was a fine one, thoroughly up-to-date, and had cost considerable money.  \"We'll have to get a name for this machine,\" remarked Tom. \"Have you any in mind?\"  \"Well, I--er--thought we might call her the--er----\" And then his big brother stopped short and grew slightly red in the face.  \"I'll bet an apple you were going to say _Dora_,\" cried Tom quickly.  \"Humph,\" murmured Dick. \"Maybe you were going to suggest _Nellie_."]]]
