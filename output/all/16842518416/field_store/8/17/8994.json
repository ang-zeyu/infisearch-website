He also knew that now, just before him, Buff Miles was proceeding with the snowplow, cutting a firm, white way, smooth and sparkling for soft treading, momentarily bordered by a feathery flux, that tumbled and heaped and then lay quiet in a glitter of crystals. But his thought went on without these things and without his will.  Bruce's baby! It would be a Rule, too.... the third generation, the third generation. And accustomed as he was to relate every experience to himself, measure it, value it by its own value to him, the effect of his reflection was at first single: The third generation of Rules. _Was he as old as that?_  It seemed only yesterday that Bruce had been a boy, in a blue necktie to match his eyes, and shoes which for some reason he always put on wrong, so that the buttons were on the inside. Bruce's baby. Good heavens! It had been a shock when Bruce graduated from the high school, a shock when he had married, but his baby ... it was incredible that he himself should be so old as that.  ... This meant, then, that if Malcolm had lived, Malcolm might have had a child now....  Ebenezer had not meant to think that. It was as if the Thought came and spoke to him. He never allowed himself to think of that other life of his, when his wife, Letty, and his son Malcolm had been living. Nobody in Old Trail Town ever heard him speak of them or had ever been answered when Ebenezer had been spoken to concerning them. A high white shaft in the cemetery marked the two graves. All about them doors had been closed. But with the thought of this third generation, the doors all opened. He looked along ways that he had forgotten.  As he went he was unconscious, as he was always unconscious, of the little street. He saw the market square, not as the heart of the town, but as a place for buying and selling, and the little shops were to him not ways of providing the town with life, but ways of providing their keepers with a livelihood. Beyond these was a familiar setting, arranged that day with white background and heaped roofs and laden boughs, the houses standing side by side, like human beings. There they were, like the chorus to the thing he was thinking about. They were all thinking about it, too. Every one of them knew what he knew. Yet he never saw the bond, but he thought they were only the places where men lived who had been his factory hands and would be so yet if he had not cut them away: Ben Torrey, shoveling off his front walk with his boy sweeping behind him; August Muir, giving his little girl a ride on the snow shovel; Nettie Hatch, clearing the ice out of her mail box, while her sister--the lame one--watched from her chair by the window, interested as in a real event. Ebenezer spoke to them from some outpost of consciousness which his thought did not pass. The little street was not there, as it was never there for him, as an entity. It was merely a street. And the little town was not an entity. It was merely where he lived. He went behind Buff Miles and the snowplow--as he always went--as if space had been created for folk to live in one at a time, and as if this were his own turn.  When he reached the bend from the Old Trail to the road where the factory was, he understood at last that he had been hearing a song sung over a great many times.      \"... One for the way it all begun,     Two for the way it all has run,     What three'll be for I do forget,     But what's to be has not been yet....     So holly and mistletoe,     So holly and mistletoe,     So holly and mistletoe,     Over and over and over, oh.\"  Buff, who was singing it, looked over his shoulder, and nodded.  \"They said you can't have no Christmas on Christmas Day,\" he observed, grinning, \"but I ain't heard nothing to prevent singing Christmas carols right up to the day that is the day.\"  Ebenezer halted.  \"How old are you?\" he abruptly demanded of Buff--whom he had known from Buff's boyhood.  \"Thirty-three,\" said Buff, \"dum it.\"  \"You and Bruce about the same age, ain't you?\" said Ebenezer.  Buff nodded.  \"Well,\" said Ebenezer, \"well....\" and stood looking at him. Malcolm would have been his age, too.  \"Going down to the factory, are you?\" Buff said. \"Wait a bit. I'll hike on down ahead of you.\"  He turned the snowplow down the factory road, as if he were making a triumphal progress, fashioning his snow borders with all the freedom of some sculpturing wind on summer clouds.      \"One for the way it all begun,     Two for the way it all has run....\"  he sang to the soft push and thud and clank of his going. He swept a circle in front of the little house that was the factory office, as if he had prepared the setting for a great event; and Ebenezer, following in the long, bright path, stepped into the hall of the house.  For thirty years he had been accustomed to enter the little house with his mind ready to receive its interior of desks and shelves and safes and files. To-day, quite unexpectedly, as he opened the door, the thing that was in his mind was a hall stair with a red carpet, and a parlour adjoining with figured stuff at the windows and a coal fire in the stove.... And thirty-five years ago it had been that way, when he and his wife and child had lived in the little house where his business was then just starting at a machine set up in the woodshed. As his project had grown and his factory had arisen in the neighbouring lots, the family had moved farther up in the town. Remembrance had been divorced from this place for decades. To-day, without warning, it waited for him on the threshold.  He had asked his bookkeeper to meet him there, but the man had not yet arrived. So Ebenezer himself kindled a fire in the rusty office stove, in the room where the figured curtains had been. The old account books that he wanted were not here on the shelves, nor in the cupboards of the cold adjoining rooms. They dated so far back that they had been filed away upstairs. He had not been upstairs in years, and his first impulse was to send his bookkeeper, when he should appear. But this, after all, was not Ebenezer's way; and he went up the stairs himself.  Each upper room was like some one unconscious in stupor or death, and still as distinct in personality as if in some ancient activity. There was the shelf he had put up in their room, the burned place on the floor where he had tipped over a lamp, tattered shreds of the paper she had hung to surprise him, the little storeroom which they had cleared out for Malcolm when he was old enough, and whose door had had to be kept closed because innumerable uncaged birds lived there....  When he had gone through the piles of account books in a closet and those he sought were not found among them, he remembered the trunkful up in the tiny loft. He let down from the passage ceiling the ladder he had once hung there, and climbed up to the little roof recess.  Light entered through four broken panes of skylight. It fell in a faint rug on the dusty floor. The roof sloped sharply, and the trunks and boxes had been pressed back to the rim of the place. Ebenezer put his hands out, groping. They touched an edge of something that swayed. He laid hold of it and drew it out and set down on the faint rug of light a small wooden hobbyhorse.  He stood staring at it, remembering it as clearly as if some one had set before him the old white gate which he bestrode in his own boyhood. It was Malcolm's hobbyhorse, dappled gray, the tail and the mane missing and the paint worn off--and tenderly licked off--his nose. When they had moved to the other house, he had bought the boy a pony, and this horse had been left behind. Something else stirred in his memory, the name by which Malcolm had used to call his hobbyhorse, some ringing name ... but he had forgotten. He thrust the thing back where it had been and went on with his search for the account books.  By the time he had found them and had got down again in the office, the bookkeeper was there, keeping up the fire and uttering, with some acumen, comments on the obvious aspects of the weather, of the climate, of the visible universe. The bookkeeper was a young man, very ready to agree with Ebenezer for the sake of future favour, but with the wistfulness of all industrial machines constructed by men from human potentialities. Also, he had a cough and thin hands and a little family and no job.  \"Get to work on this book,\" Ebenezer bade him; \"it's the one that began the business.\"  The man opened the book, put it to his nearsighted eyes, frowned, and glanced up at Ebenezer.  \"I don't think it seems....\" he began doubtfully.  \"Well, don't think,\" said Ebenezer, sharply; \"that's not needful. Read the first entries.\"  [Illustration: \"ACROSS THE STILL FIELDS CAME FLASHING THE POINT OF FLAME\"]  The bookkeeper read:--      Picking hops (4 days) . . . . $1.00     Sewing (Mrs. Shackell). . . .   .60     Egg money (3-1/4 dozen) . . .   .75     Winning puzzle. . . . . . . .  2.50                                   -----                                   $4.86      Disbursed:      Kitchen roller. . . . . . . . $ .10     Coffee mill . . . . . . . . .   .50     Shoes for M.  . . . . . . . .  1.25     Water colors for M. . . . . .   .25     Suit for M. . . . . . . . . .  2.00     Gloves--me. . . . . . . . . .   .50                                   -----                                   $4.75      Cash on hand: 11 cents.  The bookkeeper paused again. Ebenezer, frowning, reached for the book. In his wife's fine faded writing were her accounts--after the eleven cents was a funny little face with which she had been wont to illustrate her letters. Ebenezer stared, grunted, turned to the last page of the book.

Accordingly, the symbol # was chosen, primarily because it appears on every typewriter.  Up to the present time, the use of the symbol # to indicate directed mental communication has been restricted to technical papers, term theses, and scholarly treatises by professors, scholars, and students of telepathy.  Here, for the first time in any popular work, the symbol # is used to signify that the passage between the marks was mental communication.  Steve Cornell, _M. Ing._     STALEMATE   Macklin said, \"Please put that weapon down, Mr. Cornell. Let's not add attempted murder to your other crimes.\"  \"Don't force me to it, then,\" I told him.  But I knew I couldn't do it. I hated them all. I wanted the whole Highways in Hiding rolled up like an old discarded carpet, with every Mekstrom on Earth rolled up in it. But I couldn't pull the trigger. The survivors would have enough savvy to clean up the mess before our bodies got cold, and the Highways crowd would be doing business at the same old stand. Without, I might add, the minor nuisance that people call Steve Cornell.  What I really wanted was to find Catherine.  And then it came to me that what I really wanted second of all was to possess a body of Mekstrom Flesh, to be a physical superman....     I   I came up out of the blackness just enough to know that I was no longer pinned down by a couple of tons of wrecked automobile. I floated on soft sheets with only a light blanket over me.  I hurt all over like a hundred and sixty pounds of boil. My right arm was numb and my left thigh was aching. Breathing felt like being stabbed with rapiers and the skin of my face felt stretched tight. There was a bandage over my eyes and the place was as quiet as the grave. But I knew that I was not in any grave because my nose was working just barely well enough to register the unmistakable pungent odor that only goes with hospitals.  I tried my sense of perception, but like any delicate and critical sense, perception was one of the first to go. I could not dig out beyond a few inches. I could sense the bed and the white sheets and that was all.  Some brave soul had hauled me out of that crack-up before the fuel tank went up in the fire. I hope that whoever he was, he'd had enough sense to haul Catherine out of the mess first. The thought of living without Catherine was too dark to bear, and so I just let the blackness close down over me again because it cut out all pain, both physical and mental.  The next time I awoke there was light and a pleasant male voice saying, \"Steve Cornell. Steve, can you hear me?\"  I tried to answer but no sound came out. Not even a hoarse croak.  The voice went on, \"Don't try to talk, Steve. Just think it.\"  #Catherine?# I thought sharply, because most medicos are telepath, not perceptive.  \"Catherine is all right,\" he replied.  #Can I see her?#  \"Lord no!\" he said quickly. \"You'd scare her half to death the way you look right now.\"  #How bad off am I?#  \"You're a mess, Steve. Broken ribs, compound fracture of the left tibia, broken humerus. Scars, mars, abrasions, some flashburn and post-accident shock. And if you're interested, not a trace of Mekstrom's Disease.\"  #Mekstrom's Disease--?# was my thought of horror.  \"Forget it, Steve. I always check for it because it's been my specialty. Don't worry.\"  #Okay. So how long have I been here?#  \"Eight days.\"  #Eight days? Couldn't you do the usual job?#  \"You were pretty badly ground up, Steve. That's what took the time. Now, suppose you tell me what happened?\"  #Catherine and I were eloping. Just like most other couples do since Rhine Institute made it difficult to find personal privacy. Then we cracked up.#  \"What did it?\" asked the doctor. \"Perceptives like you usually sense danger before you can see it.\"  #Catherine called my attention to a peculiar road sign, and I sent my perception back to take another dig. We hit the fallen limb of a tree and went over and over. You know the rest.#  \"Bad,\" said the doctor. \"But what kind of a sign would call your interest so deep that you didn't at least see the limb, even if you were perceiving the sign?\"  #Peculiar sign,# I thought. Ornamental wrought iron gizmo with curlicues and a little decorative circle that sort of looks like the Boy Scout tenderfoot badge suspended on three spokes. One of the spokes were broken away; I got involved because I was trying to guess whether it had been shot away by some vandal who missed the central design. Then--blooie!#  \"It's really too bad, Steve. But you'll be all right in a while.\"  #Thanks, doctor. Doctor? Doctor--?#  \"Sorry, Steve. I forget that everybody is not telepath like I am. I'm James Thorndyke.\"  Much later I began to wake up again, and with better clarity of mind, I found that I could extend my esper as far as the wall and through the door by a few inches. It was strictly hospital all right; sere white and stainless steel as far as my esper could reach.  In my room was a nurse, rustling in starched white. I tried to speak, croaked once, and then paused to form my voice.  \"Can--I see--How is--? Where is?\" I stopped again, because the nurse was probably as esper as I was and required a full sentence to get the thought behind it. Only a telepath like the doctor could have followed my jumbled ideas. But the nurse was good. She tried:  \"Mr. Cornell? You're awake!\"  \"Look--nurse--\"  \"Take it easy. I'm Miss Farrow. I'll get the doctor.\"  \"No--wait. I've been here eight days--?\"  \"But you were badly hurt, you know.\"  \"But the doctor. He said that she was here, too.\"  \"Don't worry about it, Mr. Cornell.\"  \"But he said that she was not badly hurt.\"  \"She wasn't.\"  \"Then why was--is--she here so long?\"  Miss Farrow laughed cheerfully. \"Your Christine is in fine shape. She is still here because she wouldn't leave until you were well out of danger. Now stop fretting. You'll see her soon enough.\"  Her laugh was light but strained. It sounded off-key because it was as off-key as a ten-yard-strip of baldfaced perjury. She left in a hurry and I was able to esper as far as outside the door, where she leaned back against the wood and began to cry. She was hating herself because she had blown her lines and she knew that I knew it.  And Catherine had never been in this hospital, because if she had been brought in with me, the nurse would have known the right name.  Not that it mattered to me now, but Miss Farrow was no esper or she'd have dug my belongings and found Catherine's name on the license. Miss Farrow was a telepath; I'd not called my girl by name, only by an affectionate mental image.     II   I was fighting my body upright when Doctor Thorndyke came running. \"Easy, Steve,\" he said with a quiet gesture. He pushed me gently back down in the bed with hands that were as soft as a mother's, but as firm as the kind that tie bow knots in half-inch bars. \"Easy,\" he repeated soothingly.  \"Catherine?\" I croaked pleadingly.  Thorndyke fingered the call button in some code or other before he answered me. \"Steve,\" he said honestly, \"you can't be kept in ignorance forever. We hoped it would be a little longer, when you were stronger--\"  \"Stop beating around!\" I yelled. At least it felt like I was yelling, but maybe it was only my mind welling.  \"Easy, Steve. You've had a rough time. Shock--\" The door opened and a nurse came in with a hypo all loaded, its needle buried in a fluff of cotton. Thorndyke eyed it professionally and took it; the nurse faded quietly from the room. \"Take it easy, Steve. This will--\"  \"No! Not until I know--\"  \"Easy,\" he repeated. He held the needle up before my eyes. \"Steve,\" he said, \"I don't know whether you have enough esper training to dig the contents of this needle, but if you haven't, will you please trust me? This contains a neurohypnotic. It won't put you under. It will leave you as wide awake as you are now, but it will disconnect your running gear and keep you from blowing a fuse.\" Then with swift deftness that amazed me, the doctor slid the needle into my arm and let me have the full load.  I was feeling the excitement rise in me because something was wrong, but I could also feel the stuff going to work. Within half a minute I was in a chilled-off frame of mind that was capable of recognizing the facts but not caring much one way or the other.  When he saw the stuff taking hold, Thorndyke asked, \"Steve, just who is Catherine?\"  The shock almost cut through the drug. My mind whirled with all the things that Catherine was to me, and the doctor followed it every bit of the way.  \"Steve, you've been under an accident shock. There was no Catherine with you. There was no one with you at all. Understand that and accept it. No one. You were alone. Do you understand?\"  I shook my head. I sounded to myself like an actor reading the script of a play for the first time. I wanted to pound on the table and add the vigor of physical violence to my hoarse voice, but all I could do was to reply in a calm voice:  \"Catherine was with me. We were--\" I let it trail off because Thorndyke knew very well what we were doing. We were eloping in the new definition of the word."]]]
