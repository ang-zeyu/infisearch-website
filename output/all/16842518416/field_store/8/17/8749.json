The other objects of our consciousness are on the margin of the field for the time being, but any of them may the next moment claim the center and drive the former object to the margin, or it may drop entirely out of consciousness. This moment a noble resolve may occupy the center of the field, while a troublesome tooth begets sensations of discomfort which linger dimly on the outskirts of our consciousness; but a shooting pain from the tooth or a random thought crossing the mind, and lo! the tooth holds sway, and the resolve dimly fades to the margin of our consciousness and is gone.  THE \"PILING UP\" OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ATTENTION.--This figure is not so true as the one which likens our mind to a stream with its ever onward current answering to the flow of our thought; but whichever figure we employ, the truth remains the same. Our mental energy is always piled up higher at one point than at others. Either because our interest leads us, or because the will dictates, the mind is withdrawn from the thousand and one things we might think about, and directed to this one thing, which for the time occupies chief place. In other words, we _attend_; for this piling up of consciousness is nothing, after all, but attention.   3. CONTENT OF THE MENTAL STREAM  We have seen that our mental life may be likened to a stream flowing now faster, now slower, ever shifting, never ceasing. We have yet to inquire what constitutes the material of the stream, or what is the stuff that makes up the current of our thought--what is the _content_ of consciousness? The question cannot be fully answered at this point, but a general notion can be gained which will be of service.  WHY WE NEED MINDS.--Let us first of all ask what mind is for, why do animals, including men, have minds? The biologist would say, in order that they may _adapt_ themselves to their environment. Each individual from mollusc to man needs the amount and type of mind that serves to fit its possessor into its particular world of activity. Too little mind leaves the animal helpless in the struggle for existence. On the other hand a mind far above its possessor's station would prove useless if not a handicap; a mollusc could not use the mind of a man.  CONTENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS DETERMINED BY FUNCTION.--How much mind does man need? What range and type of consciousness will best serve to adjust us to our world of opportunity and responsibility? First of all we must _know_ our world, hence, our mind must be capable of gathering knowledge. Second, we must be able to _feel_ its values and respond to the great motives for action arising from the emotions. Third, we must have the power to exert self-compulsion, which is to say that we possess a _will_ to control our acts. These three sets of processes, _knowing_, _feeling_, and _willing_, we shall, therefore, expect to find making up the content of our mental stream.  Let us proceed at once to test our conclusion by introspection. If we are sitting at our study table puzzling over a difficult problem in geometry, _reasoning_ forms the wave in the stream of consciousness--the center of the field. It is the chief thing in our thinking. The fringe of our consciousness is made up of various sensations of the light from the lamp, the contact of our clothing, the sounds going on in the next room, some bit of memory seeking recognition, a \"tramp\" thought which comes along, and a dozen other experiences not strong enough to occupy the center of the field.  But instead of the study table and the problem, give us a bright fireside, an easy-chair, and nothing to do. If we are aged, _memories_--images from out the past--will probably come thronging in and occupy the field to such extent that the fire burns low and the room grows cold, but still the forms from the past hold sway. If we are young, visions of the future may crowd everything else to the margin of the field, while the \"castles in Spain\" occupy the center.  Our memories may also be accompanied by emotions--sorrow, love, anger, hate, envy, joy. And, indeed, these emotions may so completely occupy the field that the images themselves are for the time driven to the margin, and the mind is occupied with its sorrow, its love, or its joy.  Once more, instead of the problem or the memories or the \"castles in Spain,\" give us the necessity of making some decision, great or small, where contending motives are pulling us now in this direction, now in that, so that the question finally has to be settled by a supreme effort summed up in the words, _I will_. This is the struggle of the will which each one knows for himself; for who has not had a raging battle of motives occupy the center of the field while all else, even the sense of time, place and existence, gave way in the face of this conflict! This struggle continues until the decision is made, when suddenly all the stress and strain drop out and other objects may again have place in consciousness.  THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL PHASES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Thus we see that if we could cut the stream of consciousness across as we might cut a stream of water from bank to bank with a huge knife, and then look at the cut-off section, we should find very different constituents in the stream at different times. We should at one time find the mind manifesting itself in _perceiving_, _remembering_, _imagining_, _discriminating_, _comparing_, _judging_, _reasoning_, or the acts by which we gain our knowledge; at another in _fearing_, _loving_, _hating_, _sorrowing_, _enjoying_, or the acts of feeling; at still another in _choosing_, or the act of the will. These processes would make up the stream, or, in other words, these are the acts which the mind performs in doing its work. We should never find a time when the stream consists of but one of the processes, or when all these modes of mental activity are not represented. They will be found in varying proportions, now more of knowing, now of feeling, and now of willing, but some of each is always present in our consciousness. The nature of these different elements in our mental stream, their relation to each other, and the manner in which they all work together in amazing perplexity yet in perfect harmony to produce the wonderful _mind_, will constitute the subject-matter we shall consider together in the pages which follow.   4. WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS RESIDES  I--the conscious self--dwell somewhere in this body, but where? When my finger tips touch the object I wish to examine, I seem to be in them. When the brain grows weary from overstudy, I seem to be in it. When the heart throbs, the breath comes quick, and the muscles grow tense from noble resolve or strong emotion, I seem to be in them all. When, filled with the buoyant life of vigorous youth, every fiber and nerve is a-tingle with health and enthusiasm, I live in every part of my marvelous body. Small wonder that the ancients located the soul at one time in the heart, at another in the pineal gland of the brain, and at another made it coextensive with the body!  CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--Later science has taught that the _mind resides in and works through the nervous system, which has its central office in the brain_. And the reason why _I_ seem to be in every part of my body is because the nervous system extends to every part, carrying messages of sight or sound or touch to the brain, and bearing in return orders for movements, which set the feet a-dancing or the fingers a-tingling. But more of this later.  This partnership between mind and body is very close. Just how it happens that spirit may inhabit matter we may not know. But certain it is that they interact on each other. What will hinder the growth of one will handicap the other, and what favors the development of either will help both. The methods of their co√∂peration and the laws that govern their relationship will develop as our study goes on.   5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION  One should always keep in mind that psychology is essentially a laboratory science, and not a text-book subject. The laboratory material is to be found in ourselves and in those about us. While the text should be thoroughly mastered, its statements should always be verified by reference to one's own experience, and observation of others. Especially should prospective teachers constantly correlate the lessons of the book with the observation of children at work in the school. The problems suggested for observation and introspection will, if mastered, do much to render practical and helpful the truths of psychology.  1. Think of your home as you last left it. Can you see vividly just how it looked, the color of the paint on the outside, with the familiar form of the roof and all; can you recall the perfume in some old drawer, the taste of a favorite dish, the sound of a familiar voice in farewell?  2. What illustrations have you observed where the mental content of the moment seemed chiefly _thinking_ (knowledge process); chiefly _emotion_ (feeling process); chiefly _choosing_, or self-compulsion (willing process)?  3. When you say that you remember a circumstance that occurred yesterday, how do you remember it? That is, do you see in your mind things just as they were, and hear again sounds which occurred, or feel again movements which you performed? Do you experience once more the emotions you then felt?  4. What forms of expression most commonly reveal _thought_; what reveal emotions? (i.e., can you tell what a child is _thinking about_ by the expression on his face? Can you tell whether he is _angry_, _frightened_, _sorry_, by his face? Is speech as necessary in expressing feeling as in expressing thought?)  5. Try occasionally during the next twenty-four hours to turn quickly about mentally and see whether you can observe your thinking, feeling, or willing in the very act of taking place.  6. What becomes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],["title","The Mind and Its Education (#4)"],["body"," our mind or consciousness while we are asleep? How are we able to wake up at a certain hour previously determined? Can a person have absolutely _nothing_ in his mind?  7. Have you noticed any children especially adept in expression? Have you noticed any very backward? If so, in what form of expression in each case?  8. Have you observed any instances of expression which you were at a loss to interpret (remember that \"expression\" includes every form of physical action, voice, speech, face, form, hand, etc.)?     CHAPTER II  ATTENTION   How do you rank in mental ability, and how effective are your mind's grasp and power? The answer that must be given to these questions will depend not more on your native endowment than on your skill in using attention.   1. NATURE OF ATTENTION  It is by attention that we gather and mass our mental energy upon the critical and important points in our thinking. In the last chapter we saw that consciousness is not distributed evenly over the whole field, but \"piled up,\" now on this object of thought, now on that, in obedience to interest or necessity. _The concentration of the mind's energy on one object of thought is attention._  THE NATURE OF ATTENTION.--Everyone knows what it is to attend. The story so fascinating that we cannot leave it, the critical points in a game, the interesting sermon or lecture, the sparkling conversation--all these compel our attention. So completely is our mind's energy centered on them and withdrawn from other things that we are scarcely aware of what is going on about us.  We are also familiar with another kind of attention. For we all have read the dull story, watched the slow game, listened to the lecture or sermon that drags, and taken part in conversation that was a bore. We gave these things our attention, but only with effort. Our mind's energy seemed to center on anything rather than the matter in hand. A thousand objects from outside enticed us away, and it required the frequent \"mental jerk\" to bring us to the subject in hand. And when brought back to our thought problem we felt the constant \"tug\" of mind to be free again.  NORMAL CONSCIOUSNESS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF ATTENTION.--But this very effort of the mind to free itself from one object of thought that it may busy itself with another is _because attention is solicited by this other_. Some object in our field of consciousness is always exerting an appeal for attention; and to attend _to_ one thing is always to attend _away from_ a multitude of other things upon which the thought might rest. We may therefore say that attention is constantly _selecting_ in our stream of thought those aspects that are to receive emphasis and consideration. From moment to moment it determines the points at which our mental energy shall be centered.   2. THE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION  ATTENTION MAKES ITS OBJECT CLEAR AND DEFINITE.--Whatever attention centers upon stands out sharp and clear in consciousness. Whether it be a bit of memory, an \"air-castle,\" a sensation from an aching tooth, the reasoning on an algebraic formula, a choice which we are making, the setting of an emotion--whatever be the object to which we are attending, that object is illumined and made to stand out from its fellows as the one prominent thing in the mind's eye while the attention rests on it. It is like the one building which the searchlight picks out among a city full of buildings and lights up, while the remainder are left in the semilight or in darkness.  ATTENTION MEASURES MENTAL EFFICIENCY.--In a state of attention the mind may be likened to the rays of the sun which have been passed through a burning glass. You may let all the rays which can pass through your window pane fall hour after hour upon the paper lying on your desk, and no marked effects follow. But let the same amount of sunlight be passed through a lens and converged to a point the size of your pencil point, and the paper will at once burst into flame. What the diffused rays could not do in hours or in ages is now accomplished in seconds. Likewise the mind, allowed to scatter over many objects, can accomplish but little. We may sit and dream away an hour or a day over a page or a problem without securing results. But let us call in our wits from their wool-gathering and \"buckle down to it\" with all our might, withdrawing our thoughts from everything else but this _one thing_, and concentrating our mind on it. More can now be accomplished in minutes than before in hours. Nay, _things which could not be accomplished at all before_ now become possible.  Again, the mind may be compared to a steam engine which is constructed to run at a certain pressure of steam, say one hundred and fifty pounds to the square inch of boiler surface. Once I ran such an engine; and well I remember a morning during my early apprenticeship when the foreman called for power to run some of the lighter machinery, while my steam gauge registered but seventy-five pounds. \"Surely,\" I thought, \"if one hundred and fifty pounds will run all this machinery, seventy-five pounds should run half of it,\" so I opened the valve. But the powerful engine could do but little more than turn its own wheels, and refused to do the required work. Not until the pressure had risen above one hundred pounds could the engine perform half the work which it could at one hundred and fifty pounds. And so with our mind. If it is meant to do its best work under a certain degree of concentration, it cannot in a given time do half the work with half the attention. Further, there will be much _which it cannot do at all_ unless working under full pressure. We shall not be overstating the case if we say that as attention increases in arithmetical ratio, mental efficiency increases in geometrical ratio. It is in large measure a difference in the power of attention which makes one man a master in thought and achievement and another his humble follower. One often hears it said that \"genius is but the power of sustained attention,\" and this statement possesses a large element of truth.   3. HOW WE ATTEND  Someone has said that if our attention is properly trained we should be able \"to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour without winking.\" But this is a false idea of attention. The ability to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour might indicate a very laudable power of concentration; but the process, instead of enlightening us concerning the point of the needle, would result in our passing into a hypnotic state. Voluntary attention to any one object can be sustained for but a brief time--a few seconds at best. It is essential that the object change, that we turn it over and over incessantly, and consider its various aspects and relations. Sustained voluntary attention is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring back the object to the mind. Then the subject grows and develops--it is living, not dead.  ATTENTION A RELATING ACTIVITY.--When we are attending strongly to one object of thought it does not mean that consciousness sits staring vacantly at this one object, but rather that it uses it as a central core of thought, and thinks into relation with this object the things which belong with it. In working out some mathematical solution the central core is the principle upon which the solution is based, and concentration in this case consists in thinking the various conditions of the problem in relation to this underlying principle. In the accompanying diagram (Fig. 4) let A be the central core of some object of thought, say a patch of cloud in a picture, and let _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., be the related facts, or the shape, size, color, etc., of the cloud. The arrows indicate the passing of our thought from cloud to related fact, or from related fact to cloud, and from related fact to related fact. As long as these related facts lead back to the cloud each time, that long we are attending to the cloud and thinking about it. It is when our thought fails to go back that we \"wander\" in our attention. Then we leave _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., which are related to the cloud, and, flying off to _x_, _y_, and _z,_ finally bring up heaven knows where.  [Illustration: FIG. 4]  THE RHYTHMS OF ATTENTION.--Attention works in rhythms. This is to say that it never maintains a constant level of concentration for any considerable length of time, but regularly ebbs and flows. The explanation of this rhythmic action would take us too far afield at this point. When we remember, however, that our entire organism works within a great system of rhythms--hunger, thirst, sleep, fatigue, and many others--it is easy to see that the same law may apply to attention. The rhythms of attention vary greatly, the fluctuations often being only a few seconds apart for certain simple sensations, and probably a much greater distance apart for the more complex process of thinking. The seeming variation in the sound of a distant waterfall, now loud and now faint, is caused by the rhythm of attention and easily allows us to measure the rhythm for this particular sensation.   4. POINTS OF FAILURE IN ATTENTION  LACK OF CONCENTRATION.--There are two chief types of inattention whose danger threatens every person. _First_, we may be thinking about the right things, but not thinking _hard_ enough. We lack mental pressure. Outside thoughts which have no relation to the subject in hand may not trouble us much, but we do not attack our problem with vim. The current in our stream of consciousness is moving too slowly. We do not gather up all our mental forces and mass them on the subject before us in a way that means victory. Our thoughts may be sufficiently focused, but they fail to \"set fire.\" It is like focusing the sun's rays while an eclipse is on. They lack energy. They will not kindle the paper after they have passed through the lens. This kind of attention means mental dawdling. It means inefficiency. For the individual it means defeat in"]]]
