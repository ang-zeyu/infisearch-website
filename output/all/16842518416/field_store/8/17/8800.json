The hula, it is true, has been unfortunate in the mode and            manner of its introduction to us moderns. An institution of            divine, that is, religious, origin, the hula in modern times [Page 8]   has wandered so far and fallen so low that foreign and            critical esteem has come to associate it with the riotous and            passionate ebullitions of Polynesian kings and the amorous            posturing of their voluptuaries. We must make a just            distinction, however, between the gestures and bodily            contortions presented by the men and women, the actors in the            hula, and their uttered words. “The voice is Jacob’s voice,            but the hands are the hands of Esau.” In truth, the actors in            the hula no longer suit the action to the word. The utterance            harks back to the golden age; the gesture is trumped up by            the passion of the hour, or dictated by the master of the            hula, to whom the real meaning of the old bards is ofttimes a            sealed casket.            Whatever indelicacy attaches in modern times to some of the            gestures and contortions of the hula dancers, the old-time            hula songs in large measure were untainted with grossness. If            there ever were a Polynesian Arcadia, and if it were possible            for true reports of the doings and sayings of the Polynesians            to reach us from that happy land—reports of their joys and            sorrows, their love-makings and their jealousies, their            family spats and reconciliations, their worship of beauty and            of the gods and goddesses who walked in the garden of            beauty—we may say, I think, that such a report would be in            substantial agreement with the report that is here offered;            but, if one’s virtue will not endure the love-making of            Arcadia, let him banish the myth from his imagination and hie            to a convent or a nunnery.             If this book does nothing more than prove that savages are            only children of a younger growth than ourselves, that what            we find them to have been we ourselves—in our            ancestors—once were, the labor of making it will have been            not in vain.             For an account of the first hula we may look to the story            of Pele. On one occasion that goddess begged her sisters to            dance and sing before her, but they all excused themselves,            saying they did not know the art. At that moment in came            little Hiiaka, the youngest and the favorite. Unknown to her            sisters, the little maiden had practised the dance under the            tuition of her friend, the beautiful but ill-fated Hopoe.            When banteringly invited to dance, to the surprise of all,            Hiiaka modestly complied. The wave-beaten sand-beach was her            floor, the open air her hall. Feet and hands and swaying            form kept time to her improvisation:                  Look, Puna is a-dance in the wind;                 The palm groves of Kea-au shaken.                 Haena and the woman Hopoe dance and sing                 On the beach Nana-huki,                 A dance of purest delight,                 Down by the sea Nana-huki.             The nature of this work has made it necessary to use            occasional Hawaiian words in the technical parts. At their [Page 9]   first introduction it has seemed fitting that they should be            distinguished by italics; but, once given the entrée, it is            assumed that, as a rule, they will be granted the rights of            free speech without further explanation.             A glossary, which explains all the Hawaiian words used in the            prose text, is appended. Let no one imagine, however, that by            the use of this little crutch alone he will be enabled to            walk or stumble through the foreign ways of the simplest            Hawaiian _mele_. Notes, often copious, have been appended to            many of the mele, designed to exhaust neither the subject nor            the reader, but to answer some of the questions of the            intelligent thinker.             Thanks, many thanks, are due, first, to those native            Hawaiians who have so far broken with the old superstitious            tradition of concealment as to unearth so much of the            unwritten literary wealth stored in Hawaiian memories;            second, to those who have kindly contributed criticism,            suggestion, material at the different stages of this book’s            progress; and, lastly, to those dear friends of the author’s            youth—living or dead—whose kindness has made it possible to            send out this fledgling to the world. The author feels under            special obligations to Dr. Titus Munson Coan, of New York,            for a painstaking revision of the manuscript.             HONOLULU, HAWAII.  [Page 10][Blank]  [Page 11]                                LITERATURE OF HAWAII                             By NATHANIEL B. EMERSON                                     I.—THE HULA             One turns from the study of old genealogies, myths, and            traditions of the Hawaiians with a hungry despair at finding            in them means so small for picturing the people themselves,            their human interests and passions; but when it comes to the            hula and the whole train of feelings and sentiments that made            their entrances and exits in the _halau_ (the hall of the            hula) one perceives that in this he has found the door to the            heart of the people. So intimate and of so simple confidence            are the revelations the people make of themselves in their            songs and prattlings that when one undertakes to report what            he has heard and to translate into the terms of modern speech            what he has received in confidence, as it were, he almost            blushes, as if he had been guilty of spying on Adam and Eve            in their nuptial bower. Alas, if one could but muffle his            speech with the unconscious lisp of infancy, or veil and tone            his picture to correspond to the perspective of antiquity, he            might feel at least that, like Watteau, he had dealt            worthily, if not truly, with that ideal age which we ever            think of as the world’s garden period.             The Hawaiians, it is true, were many removes from being            primitives; their dreams, however, harked back to a period            that was close to the world’s infancy. Their remote ancestry            was, perhaps, akin to ours—Aryan, at least Asiatic—but the            orbit of their evolution seems to have led them away from the            strenuous discipline that has whipped the Anglo-Saxon branch            into fighting shape with fortune.             If one comes to the study of the hula and its songs in the            spirit of a censorious moralist he will find nothing for him;            if as a pure ethnologist, he will take pleasure in pointing            out the physical resemblances of the Hawaiian dance to the            languorous grace of the Nautch girls, of the geisha, and            other oriental dancers. But if he comes as a student and            lover of human nature, back of the sensuous posturings, in            the emotional language of the songs he will find himself            entering the playground of the human race.             The hula was a religious service, in which poetry, music,            pantomime, and the dance lent themselves, under the forms of [Page 12]  dramatic art, to the refreshment of men’s minds. Its view of            life was idyllic, and it gave itself to the celebration of            those mythical times when gods and goddesses moved on the            earth as men and women and when men and women were as gods.            As to subject-matter, its warp was spun largely from the            bowels of the old-time mythology into cords through which the            race maintained vital connection with its mysterious past.            Interwoven with these, forming the woof, were threads of a            thousand hues and of many fabrics, representing the            imaginations of the poet, the speculations of the            philosopher, the aspirations of many a thirsty soul, as well            as the ravings and flame-colored pictures of the sensualist,            the mutterings and incantations of the _kahuna_, the            mysteries and paraphernalia of Polynesian mythology, the            annals of the nation’s history—the material, in fact, which            in another nation and under different circumstances would            have gone to the making of its poetry, its drama, its opera,            its literature.             The people were superstitiously religious; one finds their            drama saturated with religious feeling, hedged about with            tabu, loaded down with prayer and sacrifice. They were            poetical; nature was full of voices for their ears; their            thoughts came to them as images; nature was to them an            allegory; all this found expression in their dramatic art.            They were musical; their drama must needs be cast in forms to            suit their ideas of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20299"],["title","Unwritten Literature of Hawaii: The Sacred Songs of the Hula (#2)"],["body","m, of melody, and of poetic harmony.            They were, moreover, the children of passion, sensuous,            worshipful of whatever lends itself to pleasure. How, then,            could the dramatic efforts of this primitive people, still in            the bonds of animalism, escape the note of passion? The songs            and other poetic pieces which have come down to us from the            remotest antiquity are generally inspired with a purer            sentiment and a loftier purpose than the modern; and it may            be said of them all that when they do step into the mud it is            not to tarry and wallow in it; it is rather with the            unconscious naiveté of a child thinking no evil.             On the principle of “the terminal conversion of opposites,”            which the author once heard an old philosopher expound, the            most advanced modern is better able to hark back to the            sweetness and light and music of the primeval world than the            veriest wigwam-dweller that ever chipped an arrowhead. It is            not so much what the primitive man can give us as what we can            find in him that is worth our while. The light that a Goethe,            a Thoreau, or a Kipling can project into Arcadia is mirrored            in his own nature.             If one mistakes not the temper and mind of this generation,            we are living in an age that is not content to let perish one            seed of thought or one single phase of life that can be            rescued from the drift of time. We mourn the extinction of            the buffalo of the plains and of the birds of the islands, [Page 13]  rightly thinking that life is somewhat less rich and full            without them. What of the people of the plains and of the            islands of the sea? Is their contribution so nothingless that            one can affirm that the orbit of man’s mind is complete            without it?             Comparison is unavoidable between the place held by the dance            in ancient Hawaii and that occupied by the dance in our            modern society. The ancient Hawaiians did not personally and            informally indulge in the dance for their own amusement, as            does pleasure-loving society at the present time. Like the            Shah of Persia, but for very different reasons, Hawaiians of            the old time left it to be done for them by a body of trained            and paid performers. This was not because the art and            practice of the hula were held in disrepute—quite the            reverse—but because the hula was an accomplishment requiring            special education and arduous training in both song and            dance, and more especially because it was a religious matter,            to be guarded against profanation by the observance of tabus            and the performance of priestly rites.             This fact, which we find paralleled in every form of communal            amusement, sport, and entertainment in ancient Hawaii, sheds            a strong light on the genius of the Hawaiian. We are wont to            think of the old-time Hawaiians as light-hearted children of            nature, given to spontaneous outbursts of song and dance as            the mood seized them; quite as the rustics of “merrie            England” joined hands and tripped “the light fantastic toe”            in the joyous month of May or shouted the harvest home at a            later season. The genius of the Hawaiian was different. With            him the dance was an affair of premeditation, an organized            effort, guarded by the traditions of a somber religion. And            this characteristic, with qualifications, will be found to            belong to popular Hawaiian sport and amusement of every            variety. Exception must be made, of course, of the            unorganized sports of childhood. One is almost inclined to            generalize and to say that those children of nature, as we            are wont to call them, in this regard were less free and            spontaneous than the more advanced race to which we are proud            to belong. But if the approaches to the temple of Terpsichore            with them were more guarded, we may confidently assert that            their enjoyment therein was deeper and more abandoned.  [Page 14]                     II.—THE HALAU; THE KUAHU—THEIR DECORATION                                 AND CONSECRATION                                     THE HALAU             In building a halau, or hall, in which to perform the hula a            Hawaiian of the old, old time was making a temple for his            god. In later and degenerate ages almost any structure would            serve the purpose; it might be a flimsy shed or an            extemporaneous _lanai_ such as is used to shelter that _al            fresco_ entertainment, the _luau_. But in the old times of            strict tabu and rigorous etiquette, when the chief had but to            lift his hand and the entire population of a district            ransacked plain, valley, and mountain to collect the poles,            beams, thatch, and cordstuff; when the workers were so            numerous that the structure grew and took shape in a day, we            may well believe that ambitious and punctilious patrons of            the hula, such as La’a, Liloa, or Lono-i-ka-makahiki, did not            allow the divine art of Laka to house in a barn.             The choice of a site was a matter of prime importance. A            formidable code enunciated the principles governing the            selection. But—a matter of great solicitude—there were            omens to be heeded, snares and pitfalls devised by the            superstitious mind for its own entanglement. The untimely            sneeze, the ophthalmic eye, the hunched back were omens to be            shunned.             Within historic times, since the abrogation of the tabu            system and the loosening of the old polytheistic ideas, there            has been in the hula a lowering of former standards, in some            respects a degeneration. The old gods, however, were not            entirely dethroned; the people of the hula still continued to            maintain the form of divine service and still appealed to            them for good luck; but the soul of worship had exhaled; the            main study now was to make of the hula a pecuniary success.             In an important sense the old way was in sympathy with the            thought, “Except God be with the workmen, they labor in vain            that build the house.” The means for gaining divine favor and            averting the frown of the gods were those practised by all            religionists in the infantile state of the human mind—the            observance of fasts and tabus, the offering of special            prayers and sacrifices. The ceremonial purification of the            site, or of the building if it had been used for profane            purposes, was accomplished by aspersions with sea water mixed            with turmeric or red earth. [Page 15]            When one considers the tenacious hold which all rites and            ceremonies growing out of what we are accustomed to call            superstitions had on the mind of the primitive Hawaiian, it            puzzles one to account for the entire dropping out from            modern memory of the prayers which were recited during the            erection of a hall for the shelter of an institution so            festive and so popular as the hula, while the prayers and            gloomy ritual of the temple service have survived. The            explanation may be found, perhaps, in the fact that the            priests of the temple held position by the sovereign’s            appointment; they formed a hierarchy by themselves, whereas            the position of the _kumu-hula_, who was also a priest, was            open to anyone who fitted himself for it by training and            study and by passing successfully the _ai-lolo_[2] ordeal.            After that he had the right to approach the altar of the hula            god with the prescribed offerings and to present the prayers            and petitions of the company to Laka or Kapo.             [Footnote 2: _Ai-lolo_. See pp. 32, 34, 36.]             In pleasing contrast to the worship of the _heiau_, the            service of the hula was not marred by the presence of            groaning victims and bloody sacrifices. Instead we find the            offerings to have been mostly rustic tokens, things entirely            consistent with light-heartedness, joy, and ecstasy of            devotion, as if to celebrate the fact that heaven had come            down to earth and Pan, with all the nymphs, was dancing.             During the time the halau was building the tabus and rules            that regulated conduct were enforced with the utmost            strictness. The members of the company were required to            maintain the greatest propriety of demeanor, to suppress all            rudeness of speech and manner, to abstain from all carnal            indulgence, to deny themselves specified articles of food,            and above all to avoid contact with a corpse. If anyone, even            by accident, suffered such defilement, before being received            again into fellowship or permitted to enter the halau and            take part in the exercises he must have ceremonial cleansing            (_huikala_). The _kumu_ offered up prayers, sprinkled the            offender with salt water and turmeric, commanded him to bathe            in the ocean, and he was clean. If the breach of discipline            was gross and willful, an act of outrageous violence or the            neglect of tabu, the offender could be restored only after            penitence"]]]
