It was not a real dead zone, because I could still penetrate some of the region. But as far as really digging any of the details of the rambling Harrison house, I could get more from my eyesight than from any sense of perception. But even if they couldn't find a really dead area, the Harrisons had done very well in finding one that made my sense of perception ineffective. It was sort of like looking through a light fog, and the closer I got to the house the thicker it became.  Just about the point where the dead area was first beginning to make its effect tell, I came upon a tall, browned man of about twenty-four who had been probing into the interior of a tractor up to the time he heard my car. He waved, and I stopped.  \"Mr. Harrison?\"  \"I'm Phillip. And you are Mr. Cornell.\"  \"Call me Steve like everybody else,\" I said. \"How'd you guess?\"  \"Recognized you,\" he said with a grin. \"I'm the guy that pulled you out.\"  \"Thanks,\" I said, offering a hand.  He chuckled. \"Steve, consider the hand taken and shook, because I've enough grime to muss up a regiment.\"  \"It won't bother me,\" I said.  \"Thanks, but it's still a gesture, and I appreciate it, but let's be sensible. I know you can wash, but let's shake later. What can I do for you?\"  \"I'd like a first-hand account, Phil.\"  \"Not much to tell. Dad and I were pulling stumps over about a thousand feet from the wreck. We heard the racket. I am esper enough to dig that distance with clarity, so we knew we'd better bring along the block and tackle. The tractor wouldn't go through. So we came on the double, Dad rigged the tackle and hoisted and I took a running dive, grabbed and hauled you out before the whole thing went _Whoosh!_ We were both lucky, Steve.\"  I grunted a bit but managed to nod with a smile.  \"I suppose you know that I'm still trying to find my fianc√©e?\"  \"I'd heard tell,\" he said. He looked at me sharply. I'm a total blank as a telepath, like all espers, but I could tell what he was thinking.  \"Everybody is convinced that Catherine was not with me,\" I admitted. \"But I'm not. I know she was.\"  He shook his head slowly. \"As soon as we heard the screech of brakes and rubber we esped the place,\" he said quietly. \"We dug you, of course. But no one else. Even if she'd jumped as soon as that tree limb came into view, she could not have run far enough to be out of range. As for removing a bag, she'd have had to wait until the slam-bang was over to get it out, and by the time your car was finished rolling, Dad and I were on the way with help. She was not there, Steve.\"  #You're a goddam liar!#  Phillip Harrison did not move a muscle. He was blank telepathically. I was esping the muscles in his stomach, under his loose clothing, for that first tensing sign of anger, but nothing showed. He had not been reading my mind.  I smiled thinly at Phil Harrison and shrugged.  He smiled back sympathetically, but behind it I could see that he was wishing that I'd stop harping on a dead subject. \"I sincerely wish I could be of help,\" he said. In that he was sincere. But somewhere, someone was not, and I wanted to find out who it was.  The impasse looked as though it might go on forever unless I turned away and left. I had no desire to leave. Not that Phil could help me, but even though this was a dead end, I was loath to leave the place because it was the last place where I had been close to Catherine.  The silence between us must have been a bit strained at this point, but luckily we had an interruption. I perceived motion, turned and caught sight of a woman coming along the road toward us.  \"My sister,\" said Phil. \"Marian.\"  Marian Harrison was quite a girl; if I'd not been emotionally tied to Catherine Lewis, I'd have been happy to invite myself in. Marian was almost as tall as I am, a dark, brown-haired woman with eyes of a startling, electricity colored blue. She was about twenty-two, young and healthy. Her skin was tanned toast brown so that the bright blue eyes fairly sparked out at you. Her red mouth made a pleasing blend with the tan of her skin and her teeth gleamed white against the dark when she smiled.  Insultingly, I made some complimentary but impolite mental observations about her figure, but Marion did not appear to notice. She was no telepath.  \"You're Mr. Cornell,\" she said, \"I remembered you,\" she said quietly. \"Please believe us, Mr. Cornell, when we extend our sympathy.\"  \"Thanks,\" I said glumly. \"Please understand me, Miss Harrison. I appreciate your sympathy, but what I need is action and information and answers. Once I get those, the sympathy won't be needed.\"  \"Of course I understand,\" she replied instantly. \"We are all aware that sympathy is a poor substitute. All the world grieving with you doesn't turn a stitch to help you out of your trouble. All we can do is to wish, with you, that it hadn't happened.\"  \"That's the point,\" I said helplessly. \"I don't even know what happened.\"  \"That makes it even worse,\" she said softly. Marian had a pleasant voice, throaty and low, that sounded intimate even when talking about something pragmatic. \"I wish we could help you, Steve.\"  \"I wish someone could.\"  She nodded. \"They asked me about it, too, even though I was not present until afterward. They asked me,\" she said thoughtfully, \"about the mental attitude of a woman running off to get married. I told them that I couldn't speak for your woman, but that I might be able to speak for me, putting myself in the same circumstances.\"  She paused a moment, and her brother turned idly back to his tractor and fitted a small end wrench to a bolt-head and gave it a twist. He seemed to think that as long as Marian and I were talking, he could well afford to get along with his work. I agreed with him. I wanted information, but I did not expect the entire world to stop progress to help me. He spun the bolt and started on another, lost in his job while Marian went on:  \"I told them that your story was authentic--the one about the bridal nightgown.\" A very slight color came under the deep tan. \"I told them that I have one, too, still in its wrapper, and that someday I'd be planning marriage and packing a go-away bag with the gown shaken out and then packed neatly. I told them that I'd be doing the same thing no matter whether we were having a formal church wedding with a four-alarm reception and all the trimmings or a quiet elopement such as you were. I told them that it was the essentials that count, not the trimmings and the tinsel. My questioner's remark was to the effect that either you were telling the truth, or that you had esped a woman about to marry and identified her actions with your own wishes.\"  \"I know which,\" I said with a sour smile. \"It was both.\"  Marian nodded. \"Then they asked me if it were probable that a woman would take this step completely unprepared and I laughed at them. I told them that long before Rhine, women were putting their nuptial affairs in order about the time the gentleman was beginning to view marriage with an attitude slightly less than loathing, and that by the time he popped the question, she'd been practicing writing her name as 'Mrs.' and picking out the china-ware and prospective names for the children, and that if any woman had ever been so stunned by a proposal of marriage that she'd take off without so much as a toothbrush, no one in history had ever heard of her.\"  \"Then you begin to agree with me?\"  She shrugged. \"Please,\" she said in that low voice, \"don't ask me my opinion of your veracity. You believe it, but all the evidence lies against you. There was not a shred of woman-trace anywhere along your course, from the point along the road where you first caught sight of the limb that threw you to the place where you piled up. Nor was there a trace anywhere in a vast circle--almost a half mile they searched--from the crack-up. They had doctors of psi digging for footprints, shreds of clothing, everything. Not a trace.\"  \"But where did she go?\" I cried, and when I say 'cried' I mean just that.  Marian shook her head very slowly. \"Steve,\" she said in a voice so low that I could hardly hear her over the faint shrill of bolts being unscrewed by her brother, \"so far as we know, she was never here. Why don't you forget her--\"  I looked at her. She stood there, poised and a bit tensed as though she were trying to force some feeling of affectionate kinhood across the gap that separated us, as though she wanted to give me both physical and mental comfort despite the fact that we were strangers on a ten-minute first-meeting. There was distress in her face.  \"Forget her--?\" I ground out. \"I'd rather die!\"  \"Oh Steve--no!\" One hand went to her throat and the other came out to fasten around my forearm. Her grip was hard.  I stood there wondering what to do next. Marian's grip on my arm relaxed and she stepped back.  I pulled myself together. \"I'm sorry,\" I told her honestly. \"I'm putting you through a set of emotional hurdles by bringing my problems here. I'd better take them away.\"  She nodded very slowly. \"Please go. But please come back once you get yourself squared away, no matter how. We'd all like to see you when you aren't all tied up inside.\"  Phil looked up from the guts of the tractor. \"Take it easy, Steve,\" he said. \"And remember that you do have friends here.\"  Blindly I turned from them and stumbled back to my car. They were a pair of very fine people, firm, upright. Marian's grip on my arm had been no weaker than her sympathy, and Phil's less-emotional approach to my trouble was no less deep, actually. It was as strong as his good right arm, loosening the head bolts of a tractor engine with a small adjustable wrench.  I'd be back. I wanted to see them again. I wanted to go back there with Catherine and introduce them to her. But I was definitely going to go back.  I was quite a way toward home"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20519"],["title","Highways in Hiding (#4)"],["body"," I realized that I had not met the old man. I bet myself that Father Harrison was quite the firm, active patriarch.     IV   The days dragged slowly. I faced each morning hopefully at first, but as the days dragged on and on, I began to feel that each morning was opening another day of futility, to be barely borne until it was time to flop down in weariness. I faced the night in loneliness and in anger at my own inability to do something productive.  I pestered the police until they escorted me to the door and told me that if I came again, they'd take me to another kind of door and loose thereafter the key. I shrugged and left disconsolately, because by that time I had been able to esp, page by page, the entire file that dealt with the case of \"Missing Person: Lewis, Catherine,\" stamped \"Inactive, but not Closed.\"  I hated the words.  But as the days dragged out, one after another, with no respite and no hope, my raw nervous system began to heal. It was probably a case of numbness; you maul your thumb with a hammer and it will hurt just so long before it stops.  I was numb for a long time. I remember night after night, lying awake and staring into the darkness at the wall I knew was beside me, and I hated my esper because I wanted to project my mind out across some unknown space to reach for Catherine's mind. If we'd both been telepaths we could cross the universe to touch each other with that affectionate tenderness that mated telepaths always claim they have.  Instead I found myself more aware of a clouded-veil perception of Marian Harrison as she took my arm and looked into my face on that day when I admitted that I found little worth living for.  I knew what that meant--nothing. It was a case of my subconscious mind pointing out that the available present was more desirable than the unavailable not-present. At first I resented my apparent inconstancy in forming an esper projection of Marian Harrison when I was trying to project my blank telepathic inadequacy to Catherine. But as the weeks faded into the past, the shock and the frustration began to pale and I found Marian's projective image less and less an unwanted intrusion and more and more pleasant.  I had two deeply depressed spells in those six weeks. At the end of the fourth week I received a small carton containing some of my personal junk that had been in Catherine's apartment. A man can't date his girl for weeks without dropping a few things like a cigarette lighter, a tie clip, one odd cuff-link, some papers, a few letters, some books, and stuff both valuable and worthless that had turned up as gifts for one reason or another. It was a shock to get this box and its arrival bounced me deep into a doldrum-period of three or four days.  Then at the end of the sixth week I received a card from Dr. Thorndyke. It contained a lithograph in stereo of some scene in Yellowstone other than Old Faithful blowing its stack.  On the message side was a cryptic note:       _Steve: I just drove along that road in the right side of the      picture. It reminded me of yours, so I'm writing because I want to      know how you are making out. I'll be at the Med-Center in a couple      of weeks, you can write me there.       Jim Thorndyke._  I turned the postcard over and eyed it critically. Then I got it. Along the roadside was a tall ornamental standard of wrought iron. The same design as the road signs along that fatal highway of mine.  I sat there with a magnifying glass on the roadsign; its stereo image standing up alongside the road in full color and solidity. It took me back to that moment when Catherine had wriggled against my side, thrilling me with her warmth and eagerness.  That put me down a few days, too.         *       *       *       *       *  Another month passed. I'd come out of my shell quite a bit in the meantime. I now felt that I could walk in a bar and have a drink without wondering whether all the other people in the place were pointing at me. I'd cut myself off from all my previous friends, and I'd made no new friends in the weeks gone by. But I was getting more and more lonely and consequently more and more inclined to speak to people and want friends.  The accident had paled from its original horror; the vital scene returned only infrequently. Catherine was assuming the position of a lost love rather than a sweetheart expected to return soon. I remembered the warmth of her arms and the eagerness of her kiss in a nostalgic way and my mind, especially when in a doze, would play me tricks. I would recall Catherine, but when she came into my arms, I'd be holding Marian, brown and tawny, with her electric blue eyes and her vibrant nature.  But I did nothing about it. I knew that once I had asked Marian Harrison for a date I would be emotionally involved. And then if--no, when--Catherine turned up I would be torn between desires.  I would wake up and call myself all sorts of a fool. I had seen Marian for a total of perhaps fifteen minutes--in the company of her brother.  But eventually dreaming loses its sting just as futile waiting and searching does, and I awoke one morning in a long and involved debate between my id and my conscience. I decided at that moment that I would take that highway out and pay a visit to the Harrison farm. I was salving my slightly rusty conscience by telling myself that it was because I had never paid my respects to Father Harrison, but not too deep inside I knew that if Father were missing and Daughter were present I'd enjoy my visit to the farm with more relish.  But my id took a licking because the doorbell rang about nine o'clock that morning and when I dug the doorstep I came up with two gentlemen wearing gold badges in leather folders in their jacket pockets.  I opened the door because I couldn't have played absent to a team consisting of one esper and one telepath. They both knew I was home.  \"Mr. Cornell, we'll waste no time. We want to know how well you know Doctor James Thorndyke.\"  I didn't blink at the bluntness of it. It is standard technique when an esper-telepath team go investigating. The telepath knew all about me, including the fact that I'd dug their wallets and identification cards, badges and the serial numbers of the nasty little automatics they carried. The idea was to drive the important question hard and first; it being impossible to not-think the several quick answers that pop through your mind. What I knew about Thorndyke was sketchy enough but they got it all because I didn't have any reason for covering up. I let them know that, too.  Finally, #That's about all,# I thought. #Now--why?#  The telepath half of the team answered. \"Normally we wouldn't answer, Mr. Cornell, unless you said it aloud. But we don't mind letting you know which of us is the telepath this time. To answer, you are the last person to have received any message from Thorndyke.\"  \"I--what?\"  \"That postcard. It was the last contact Thorndyke made with anyone. He has disappeared.\"  \"But--\"  \"Thorndyke was due to arrive at The Medical Research Center in Marion, Indiana, three weeks ago. We've been tracking him ever since he failed to turn up. We've been able to retrace his meanderings very well up to a certain point in Yellowstone. There the trail stops. He had a telephoned reservation to a small hotel; there he dropped out of sight. Now, Mr. Cornell, may I see that postcard?\"  \"Certainly.\" I got it for them. The esper took it over to the window and eyed it in the light, and as he did that I went over to stand beside him and together we espered that postcard until I thought the edges would start to curl. But if there were any codes, concealed writings or any other form of hidden meaning or message in or on that card, I didn't dig any.  I gave up. I'm no trained investigator. But I knew that Thorndyke was fairly well acquainted with the depth of my perceptive sense, and he would not have concealed anything too deep for me.  Then the esper shook his head. He handed me the card. \"Not a trace.\"  The telepath nodded. He looked at me and smiled sort of thin and strained. \"We're naturally interested in you, Mr. Cornell. This seems to be the second disappearance. And you know nothing about either.\"  \"I know,\" I said slowly. The puzzle began to go around and around in my head again, all the way back to that gleaming road and the crack-up.  \"We'll probably be back, Mr. Cornell. You don't mind?\"  \"Look,\" I told them rather firmly, \"if this puzzle can be unwound, I'll be one of the happiest men on the planet. If I can do anything to help, just say the word.\"  They left after that and so did I. I was still going to pay my visit to the Harrison farm. Another wild goose chase, but somewhere along this cockeyed row there was an angle. Honest people who are healthy and fairly happy with good prospects ahead of them do not just drop out of sight without a trace.         *       *       *       *       *  A couple of hours later I was making a good pace along the highway again. It was getting familiar to me.  I could not avoid letting my perceptive sense rest on the sign as I drove past. Not long enough to put me in danger, but long enough to discover to my surprise that someone had taken the trouble to repair the broken spoke. Someone must have been a perfectionist. The break was so slight that it seemed like calling in a mechanic because the ashtray in the car is full.  Then I noticed other changes that time had caused.  The burned scar was fading in a growth of tall weeds. The limb of the tree that hung out over the scene, from which block and tackle had hung, was beginning to lose its smoke-blackened appearance. The block was gone from the limb.  _Give us a year_, I thought, _and the only remaining scar will be the one on my mind, and even that will be fading_.  I turned into the drive, wound around the homestead road, and pulled up in front of the big, rambling house.  It looked bleak. The front lawn was a bit shaggy and there were some"]]]
