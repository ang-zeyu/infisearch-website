BLACK BEARS AND WOLVES.   \"Wake up--wake up--wake up!\"  Frank Shaw, passenger on the United States army transport _Union_, San Francisco to the Philippines, awoke in his cabin to find the freckled face of Jimmie McGraw grinning above him.  \"What's the use?\" he demanded, sleepily and impatiently. \"It will be only another roasting day on a hot deck on an ocean fit to stew fish in. What's the use of getting up? I'm going to sleep again.\"  Frank's intentions were all right, but he did not go to sleep again. As he turned over and closed his eyes, Jimmie seized him deftly by the shoulders and dumped him out on the scarlet rug which covered the floor of the stateroom.  Frank was seventeen and Jimmie was younger, and so there was a mixture of legs and arms and vocabulary for a moment, at the end of which Jimmie broke away and made for the door, which he had thoughtfully left open as a means of retreat.  Left thus alone on the tumbled blankets of the bunk from which he had been hustled, Frank rubbed his eyes, threw a pillow at his tormentor, and began making his way toward his cozy nest, much to Jimmie's disgust.  \"Aw, come on!\" the boy urged, still standing in a safe place by the doorway. \"It's hot enough to melt brass in here, an' the siren's been shoutin' for half an hour! That means land--the Philippines! Perhaps you think you're lookin' for Battery Park, in little old New York! Get up an' look out of the port, over the rollin' sea, to the land of the little brown men!\"  Looking through the doorway, over the boy's shoulders, Frank smiled serenely at what he saw and sat waiting for something to happen. Then Jimmie was propelled headlong into the room, where he landed squarely on top of the drowsy boy he had dragged out of bed. There was another scramble for points, and then two boys of about seventeen showed their faces in the doorway, laughing at the mix-up on the floor.  The transport's siren broke out again in its long, shrill greeting of the land which lay above the rim of the sea, and Frank, catapulting Jimmie against the wall at the back of the bunk, hastened to the open port and looked out.  The boys who had entered the cabin so unceremoniously were Ned Nestor and Jack Bosworth, who were traveling with Frank and Jimmie to the Philippines, the party being under the direction of Major John Ross, of the United States Secret Service.  They had left Panama about the middle of April, and it was now not far from the first of June, the transport having been delayed for a week at Honolulu, where she had put in for supplies. The boys had enjoyed the trip hugely, but were, nevertheless, not displeased at the sight of land.  Leave it to the lads themselves, and this was a Boy Scout expedition, although there was a serious purpose behind it. Ned Nestor and Jimmie McGraw were members of the Wolf Patrol, Ned being the Patrol Leader, while Frank Shaw and Jack Bosworth were members of the famous Black Bear Patrol, both of the city of New York.  Those who have read the first two books of this series[1] will readily understand the object of this journey to the Philippines, but for the information of those who have not read the books it may be well to state here that while in Mexico and the Canal Zone Ned Nestor had been able to render valuable services to the United States government.  [Footnote 1: Boy Scouts In Mexico; or, On Guard with Uncle Sam. Boy Scouts in the Canal Zone; or, The Plot Against Uncle Sam.]  At the close of his work in the Secret Service department of the Canal Zone government, he had been invited to accompany Major Ross to the Philippines for the purpose of assisting in the uncovering of an alleged treasonable plot against the peace of the Islands and the continued supremacy of the United States Government there.  Knowing little of what there was to be done, or of what was expected of him, Ned had accepted the invitation to enter the Secret Service, stipulating only that his chums should be permitted to accompany him to Uncle Sam's new and somewhat unruly possessions in Asia.  \"I won't go if we can't make a Boy Scout outing of it,\" he had insisted. \"I shall be glad to be of service to the government, but I want the boys to have a jolly time, too. There must be plenty of opportunities for adventure in the Philippines,\" he had added, thinking of the many odd customs of the tribes of natives on the twelve hundred islands that constitute the group.  \"I shall be only too glad to have your friends go,\" the Major had replied, \"for I understand that they contributed not a little to the success of your efforts in Mexico and the Canal Zone.\"  \"I couldn't have done a thing without them,\" had been Ned's generous reply, and so it was all arranged.  However, only three of the boys who had accompanied Ned from New York to the Canal Zone had been at liberty to go to the Philippines, the others reluctantly turning back home. The three to go were now assembled in the cabin occupied by Frank Shaw, looking out to the dim line of land.  Frank Shaw was the son of the owner and editor of an influential daily newspaper in New York, Jack Bosworth was the son of a wealthy board of trade man, and Jimmie McGraw was a Bowery newsboy who had attached himself to Ned Nestor, his patrol leader, just before the visit to Mexico and had clung to him like a puppy to a root, as the saying is, ever since.  \"Come on, boys,\" Ned said, after an inspection of the ocean through the port, \"let's go on deck. We can see the whole show from there.\"  The boys trooped up to the rail and were soon joined by Major Ross. It was now a little after dawn, and a sunrise breeze was lifting little ripples on an otherwise motionless sea. Spread out, a couple of miles away, was the outline of shore the siren was greeting.  It was a low coast, stretching away to right and left until lost in the mists of the morning. It looked monotonous and furry with forests, deserted and still, but in time the presence of man became observable.  A river wound down out of the trees and broke over a bar set against its mouth in the sea. On the right bank of the stream a tin roof glistened in the early sunlight. Wherever there is a tin roof there is civilization in some degree, though this seemed to be a sleepy one.  Presently the call of the siren brought forth a boat, not in the little bay, but up the river a few hundred yards. It moved down to the coastline with only the canopy, which was of faded scarlet cloth, and the heads of the rowers in view above the tops of the bushes and creepers which lined the stream.  The land smoked under the rising temperature brought on by the climbing sun, and Jimmie chuckled as he nudged Frank's arm.  \"I see your finish there,\" he said. \"A boy as fat as you are will melt over there. There's nothin' left of the brown men in the boat but their heads!\"  Frank looked along the bow-shaped shore, over the palms, now touched with the red light of a hot morning, and wiped his streaming forehead.  \"This doesn't look good to me!\" he said. \"I thought we were going to Manila!\"  \"Didn't Ned tell you about it?\" asked Jack Bosworth.  \"Not a word.\"  \"Well, we're going to disembark here; I don't know the name of the place, or even if it has one, and make our way among some of these islands in a motor boat. There are a lot of secret service men at Manila who don't want to mix with us kids!\"  \"That's nice!\" Jimmie cried. \"We won't do a thing to 'em! We'll put it over 'em good, you see if we don't! I reckon Ned Nestor can give any of 'em half a string an' win out, at that!\"  \"Of course he can,\" Jack replied, \"but I'm not kicking at this way of doing things. I'm thinking of the motor boat, and the long days and moony nights in the seas among these islands!\"  \"It will be great!\" Jimmie admitted.  There was a short pause, and then he added, thoughtfully:  \"Who's goin' to run the boat?\"  \"I can run it,\" was the reply.  \"Yes, you can!\"  \"I own one,\" insisted Jack.  \"Yes, an' you hire a man to run it!\" Jimmie grinned. \"I don't believe you can run a hand cultivator!\"  \"Of course not!\" laughed Jack. \"But I can operate a motor boat,\" he added.  \"You can?\" demanded Jimmie, with an exasperating grin. \"Then perhaps you can tell me if the motor boat we're goin' to have has pneumatic brakes?\"  \"Sure it has!\" laughed Jack. \"And it also has a rudder that you can unship and use as a safety razor. You might open up a barber shop with it, only the eminent citizens over here don't have any more whiskers than a squash.\"  \"You're gettin' dippy!\" Jimmie shouted, darting away to the spot where Ned and the Major were standing.  Directly a flag broke out over the tin roof and in a short time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20208"],["title","Boy Scouts in the Philippines; Or, The Key to the Treaty Box (#1)"],["body","boat was at the transport's side. Full of enthusiasm, and with high hopes for the immediate future, the boys and the Major descended to the shaky little craft and the transport steamed off, her rails lined with soldiers and civilians cheering the boys and wishing them good luck.  The last voice they heard as the boat crossed the bar and swung into the sluggish current of the river was that of Captain Helmer, who had made chums and companions of the boys on the way over.  \"Good hunting!\" he cried, through his megaphone, and the marine band struck up \"Home, Sweet Home,\" \"just to give us a cheerful mood on entering this desolate land!\" as Major Ross declared.  \"Do they all think we're goin' huntin'?\" asked Jimmie, as the windrows of salt water heaped up by the transport grew smaller and lapped on the beach.  \"Sure they do,\" replied Jack. \"Do you think the Major told them we were going into the jungles to catch a few recruits for the federal prison at Manila? Nice thing, that would be!\"  \"There are just two persons, so far as I know, outside of the Secret Service headquarters at Washington, who know what we are up to,\" Major Ross said. \"These are Colonel Hill, of the Canal Zone force, and Captain Godwin, who is to receive us here.\"  The brown oarsmen tugged and strained at the oars, and the waters of the river came up to the rim of the native boat and crept in and spread themselves over the rotten floor. The boys were all glad when the prow touched the little dock at the lone pueblo where Uncle Sam's flag snapped in a breeze which was coming over the trees, bringing with it a musty smell of decaying undergrowth.  Captain Godwin met them at the landing with great hand outstretched. He was a stout, brown-faced man of fifty, with muscles like iron and a mind all stuffed and tucked in with the glory of the United States. He was proud of the service he had passed the greater part of his life in, and was proud of the record for efficiency he had made. A kindly, bluff, seasoned old man of war, with soft blue eyes and a hard hand.  \"I should have sent the _Manhattan_ after you,\" he said, after introductions had been made, \"only there's something the matter with her batteries.\"  \"You bet there is!\" laughed Jimmie. \"The only battery that never gets under foot or loses a shoe is at the foot of Broadway, in little old New York!\"  \"Hardly at the foot of Broadway,\" Jack began, but Jimmie interrupted.  \"Never mind,\" he said, \"if we know where it is! You go an' fix up this motor boat of the name of _Manhattan_, an' we'll have a ride.\"  \"The boat will be ready by to-morrow morning,\" the Captain said, smiling at the friendly arguments of the two boys. \"I presume you have your instructions?\" he added.  \"I have them here,\" Major Ross said, rather sternly, as he took a sealed packet from his pocket.  \"When and where are you to open that packet?\" asked the Captain.  \"On my arrival at this place,\" was the dignified reply.  The Major seemed to be of opinion that the Captain was stepping on his official rights.  \"Then we'll go up to the house and you look them over while I see what can be found to celebrate this auspicious event! I don't often have the pleasure of meeting four happy, husky, hungry boys fresh from the United States!\"  \"You're the goods, all right!\" shouted Jimmie. \"But how did you guess we were hungry?\"  Captain Godwin laughed and clapped both his broad palms on his knees.  \"How did I know?\" he roared. \"That's a good one! As if the boys weren't always as hungry as black bears!\"  \"There are two Black Bears in the party!\" Jimmie said.  \"And two Wolves!\" Jack added.  Captain Godwin looked from face to face in smiling wonder, and the boys thrust all kinds of Boy Scout signs and words at him.  \"I see,\" the Captain said, then. \"I've heard of the Boy Scouts! And now we'll go up to the house. Never saw a Black Bear or a Wolf that wasn't hungry!\"  The jolly Captain gave instructions to his servants and they promised, with many native grimaces and a waste of tribal vocabulary, to have a satisfying breakfast ready in half an hour. Then Godwin drew Major Ross and Ned to one side, his good-natured face assuming a grave expression as he seated them in a private room of the rambling and wobbly old house.  \"There's something unexpected here,\" he began, as the Major sat with his sealed instructions in hand, \"and I wish you would open your packet immediately. To tell you the truth, I'm not a little worried.\"  The Major opened the packet and glanced hastily through several typed sheets. Then his keen eyes grew puzzled and he arose to his feet and looked out of the window.  \"Something here I don't understand,\" he said. \"Where's this Lieutenant Rowe?\"  \"You are to confer with him here?\" asked the Captain, and Major Ross nodded assent. \"Do you know what information he possesses?\" continued the Captain, \"what papers he has in his possession?\"  \"My instructions say he has important documents.\"  \"Well,\" said the Captain, arising to his feet, \"now I'll take you to the place where I last saw Lieutenant Rowe. He came here in the launch _Manhattan_, which you are to have use of, last night, and went to bed without talking much with me. I suspect that he brought the boat from Manila, though I can't be sure. Anyway, he brought with him only two young men who did not seem to know much about the boat--Americans.\"  \"Have you seen him, the Lieutenant, or either of the young men, this morning?\" asked the Major, impatiently. \"And why do you say you will take us to the place where you saw him last? What is wrong here?\"  \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"There are no known hostile elements here, and yet the little nipa hut where Rowe and his men lodged last night was found empty this morning--empty and the contents in disorder, the floor spotted with blood.\"     CHAPTER II.  IT'S UP TO THE BOY SCOUTS.   \"Do you mean that he has been murdered?\" asked the Major, his face, flushed before, looking gray and old.  \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"I have tried to look on the bright side of the thing, but there's a subconscious warning in the back of my brain somewhere. I've tried to be jolly, this morning, but I've about reached the end of my store of optimism. It looks to me as if the Lieutenant had been made way with.\"  \"This leaves me stranded,\" the Major said. \"I am ordered to act only after acquiring later information concerning the situation, the same to be delivered by Lieutenant Rowe. In the absence of that information, what am I to do? My present orders may be all wrong.\"  \"Perhaps,\" Ned suggested, \"it may be well to visit this hut and see what we can discover there. The Lieutenant may have gone out for a morning's hunt.\"  \"No such good luck as that,\" replied the Captain. \"Why, the little furniture the hut contains is broken to bits, and the floor is streaked with blood! There was a fight in there last night, depend upon it!\"  \"And no one heard anything unusual during the night?\" asked Ned.  \"Not that I know of.\"  \"Are the usual residents of this place, so far as you know, all here this morning?\" was the next question.  \"I will ascertain that,\" said the Captain. \"I learned of the strange happening only a few minutes before your arrival.\"  The three left the house, the only one of size there, and proceeded down a mushy street between huts and thickets until they came to a little nipa hut set high on poles. They climbed the bamboo stairs and stood on the swaying porch in front, seeing no one about the place.  The door stood wide open, and Captain Godwin was first to enter. There was only one room in the hut, but there were two alcoves opening from it--narrow little alcoves in which, evidently, bedding and articles not wanted for immediate use were tucked away during the day.  As the Captain had stated, the apartment was in disorder. The mosquito wiring had been torn from the three windows and the door and now lay in a tangle on the floor. Bamboo chairs had been broken, and there was a faint odor of whisky in the room. Major Ross glanced casually over the interior and turned away.  \"I can't stop here now,\" he said impatiently. \"I've got to write a report of this happening and get it to Manila. I suppose I can depend on one of your men to deliver a letter for me?\" he added, turning to Captain Godwin.  \"Yes, but it will mean a great delay,\" replied Godwin. \"It will take at least a week for a man in a swift canoe to go to Manila and return here.\"  \"It is unfortunate,\" grumbled the Major, \"but I must, I suppose, endure the delay. Unless,\" he continued, a sudden smile coming to his face as he thought of the cozy club-life he had formerly enjoyed at Manila, \"unless I go with the messenger and receive my instructions verbally.\"  \"And in the meantime--\"  Captain Godwin was about to protest against being left alone there under such tragic circumstances, but Ned caught his eyes and stopped him. He had no idea what the boy had in mind in checking his expression of regret at the proposed departure of the Major, but he liked the appearance of the lad and closed his teeth on the words he was about to say.  \"And in the meantime,\" he repeated, \"we can look about for some traces of the missing man,\" the Captain completed the sentence.  \"Exactly,\" replied the Major. \"I regret exceedingly the peril of the situation so far as Lieutenant Rowe and his companions are concerned, and sincerely hope that they are all alive and not in serious trouble, but it appears to me that my place is at Manila at this time, and not here. We must start in on this remarkable case right, and I must confer with my superior officers.\"  \"We can put in the time very well, looking up clues in the vicinity,\" said Ned. He wanted to handle the matter in his own way, knowing that while Major Ross might be an expert in military matters, he did not possess a particle of the detective instinct so necessary at that time.  \"Yes,\" the Major replied, with his mind fixed on a few days of lazy routine at Manila, with"]]]
