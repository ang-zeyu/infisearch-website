Flowers terminating short branches, sterile and fertile, more commonly on separate trees, often on the same tree; anthers in opposite pairs; ovuliferous scales in opposite pairs, slightly spreading, acute or obtuse; ovules 1-4.  =Fruit.=--Berry-like from the coalescence of the fleshy cone-scales, the extremities of which are often visible, roundish, the size of a small pea, dark blue beneath a whitish bloom, 1-4-seeded.  =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; prefers sunny slopes and a loamy soil, but grows well in poor, thin soils and upon wind-swept sites; young plants increase in height 1-2 feet yearly and have a very formal, symmetrical outline; old trees often become irregular and picturesque, and grow very slowly; a long-lived tree; usually obtainable in nurseries and from collectors, but must frequently be transplanted to be moved with safety. If a ball of earth can be retained about the roots of wild plants, they can often be moved successfully. There are horticultural forms distinguished by a slender weeping or distorted habit, and by variegated bluish or yellowish foliage, occasionally found in American nurseries. The type is usually propagated from the seed, the horticultural forms from cuttings or by grafting.  [Illustration: PLATE XIII.--Juniperus Virginiana.]    1.

SALIX.  Inflorescence appearing with or before the leaves; flowers with entire bracts and one or two small glands; disks wanting; stamens few.   =Populus tremuloides, Michx.=  POPLAR. ASPEN.  =Habitat and Range.=--In all soils and situations except in deep swamps, though more usual in dry uplands; sometimes springing up in great abundance in clearings or upon burnt lands.       Newfoundland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia to the Hudson bay region      and Alaska.  New England,--common, reaching in the White mountain region an altitude of 3000 feet.       South to New Jersey, along the mountains in Pennsylvania and      Kentucky, ascending 3000 feet in the Adirondacks; west to the      slopes of the Rocky mountains, along which it extends to Mexico and      Lower California.  =Habit.=--A graceful tree, ordinarily 35-40 feet and not uncommonly 50-60 feet high; trunk 8-15 inches in diameter, tapering, surmounted by a very open, irregular head of small, spreading branches; spray sparse, consisting of short, stout, leafy rounded shoots set at a wide angle; distinguished by the slenderness of its habit, the light color of trunk and branches, the deep red of the sterile catkins in early spring, and the almost ceaseless flutter of the delicate foliage.  =Bark.=--Trunk pale green, smooth, dark-blotched below the branches, becoming ash-gray and roughish in old trees; season's shoots dark reddish-brown or green, shining; bitter.  =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds 1/8-1/4 inch long, reddish-brown and lustrous, usually smooth, ovate, acute, often slightly incurved at apex, the upper often appressed. Leaves 1-2-1/2 inches long, breadth usually equal to or exceeding the length, yellowish-green and ciliate when young, dark dull green above when mature, lighter beneath, glabrous on both sides, bright yellow in autumn; outline broadly ovate to orbicular, finely serrate or wavy-edged, with incurved, glandular-tipped teeth, apex rather abruptly acute or short-acuminate; base acute, truncate or slightly heart-shaped, 3-nerved; leafstalk slender, strongly flattened at right angles to the plane of the blade, bending to the slightest breath of air; stipules lanceolate, silky, soon falling.  =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Sterile catkins 1-3 inches long, fertile at first about the same length, gradually elongating; bracts cut into several lanceolate or linear divisions, silky-hairy; stamens about 10; anthers red: ovary short-stalked; stigmas two, 2-lobed, red.  =Fruit.=--June. Capsules, in elongated catkins, conical; seeds numerous, white-hairy.  =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England in the most exposed situations; grows almost anywhere, but prefers a moist, rich loam; grows rapidly; foliage and spray thin; generally short-lived; often used as a screen for slow-growing trees; type seldom found in nurseries, but one or two horticultural forms are occasionally offered. Propagated from seed or cuttings.  [Illustration: PLATE XIV.--Populus tremuloides.]    1. Branch with sterile catkins.   2. Sterile flower.   3. Branch with fertile catkins.   4. Fertile flower.   5.

LARGE-TOOTHED ASPEN.  =Habitat and Range.=--In rich or poor soils; woods, hillsides, borders of streams.       Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, southern Quebec, and Ontario.  New England,--common, occasional at altitudes of 2000 feet or more.       South to Pennsylvania and Delaware, along the mountains to      Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee; west to Minnesota.  =Habit.=--A tree 30-45 feet in height and 1 foot to 20 inches in diameter at the ground, sometimes attaining much greater dimensions; trunk erect, with an open, unsymmetrical, straggling head; branches distant, small and crooked; branchlets round; spray sparse, consisting of short, stout, leafy shoots; in time and manner of blossoming, constant motion of foliage, and general habit, closely resembling _P. tremuloides._  =Bark.=--Bark of trunk on old trees dark grayish-brown or blackish, irregularly furrowed, broad-ridged, the outer portions separated into small, thickish scales; trunk of young trees soft greenish-gray; branches greenish-gray, darker on the underside; branchlets dark greenish-gray, roughened with leaf-scars; season's twigs in fall dark reddish-brown, at first tomentose, becoming smooth and shining.  =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds 1/8 inch long, mostly divergent, light chestnut, more or less pubescent, dusty-looking, ovate, acute. Leaves 3-5 inches long, two-thirds as wide, densely white-tomentose when opening, usually smooth on both sides when mature, dark green above, lighter beneath, bright yellow in autumn; outline roundish-ovate, coarsely and irregularly sinuate-toothed; teeth acutish; sinuses in shallow curves; apex acute; base truncate or slightly heart-shaped; leafstalks long, strongly flattened at right angles to the plane of the blade; stipules thread-like, soon falling.  =Inflorescence.=--March to April. Sterile catkins 1-3 inches long, fertile at first about the same length, but gradually elongating; bracts cut into several lanceolate divisions, silky-hairy; stamens about 10; anthers red: ovaries short-stalked; stigmas two, 2-lobed, red.  =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins at length 3-6 inches long; capsule conical, acute, roughish-scurfy, hairy at tip: seeds numerous, hairy.  =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows almost anywhere, but prefers moist, rich loam; grows rapidly and is safely transplanted, but is unsymmetrical, easily broken by the wind, and short-lived; seldom offered by nurserymen, but readily procured from northern collectors of native plants. Useful to grow for temporary effect with permanent trees, as it will fail by the time the desirable kinds are well established. Propagated from seed or cuttings.  =Note.=--Points of difference between _P. tremuloides_ and _P. grandidentata_. These trees may be best distinguished in early spring by the color of the unfolding leaves. In the sunlight the head of _P. tremuloides_ appears yellowish-green, while that of _P. grandidentata_ is conspicuously cotton white. The leaves of _P. grandidentata_ are larger and more coarsely toothed, and the main branches go off usually at a broader angle. The buds of _P. grandidentata_ are mostly divergent, dusty-looking, dull; of _P. tremuloides_, mostly appressed, highly polished with a resinous lustre.

Following the eastern coast in wide belts from New York (Staten      island and Long island) south to Georgia; west along the Gulf coast      to western Louisiana, and northward along the Mississippi and Ohio      basins to Arkansas, Indiana, and Illinois.  =Habit.=--A slender, medium-sized tree, attaining a height of 30-50 feet, reaching farther south a maximum of 90 feet; trunk 9-18 inches in diameter, usually branching high up, forming a rather open hemispherical or narrow-oblong head; branches irregular, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20476"],["title","Hymns for Christian Devotion (#0)"],["body","FOR CHRISTIAN DEVOTION; ESPECIALLY ADAPTED TO THE UNIVERSALIST DENOMINATION   BY J. G. ADAMS AND E. H. CHAPIN.  TWENTY-SECOND EDITION.  BOSTON: ABEL TOMPKINS. 1853.     PREFACE.   In presenting this work to the public, the compilers would say, that they do not intend it as a rival of any other Hymn Book already in existence; but, if advancement in the light of other good works be allowable, as an improvement on them all. Although evidently designed in one sense for a denomination, they have also intended that it shall answer in some measure the demands of a liberal and progressive Christianity--a Christianity, under whatever name or pretension found, that would diffuse Christ's spirit and do his works of truth and love among men.  We have sought to give variety in these Hymns; to have the number ample enough; and while cautious in reference to their literary character, to select those of a devotional tendency, rather than those chiefly commendable for their poetical excellence. We have intended also to pay due respect to the old Hymns so justly familiar with those of every age among our worshippers, while we have not been unmindful of the new claimants of public favor.  It will be perceived that there is a greater variety of Hymns on several topics than in most other Hymn Books now in use among us; especially in reference to the philanthropic nature of our religion, and the peculiar indications of this nature in the present age. In the department of the book entitled \"Triumph of Christianity,\" faithfulness in representing this great truth is designed. In all instances where the authorship of a hymn could be ascertained, it has been given. Of a few hymns, however, taken from a copy of the new Cambridge Unitarian Hymn Book, kindly handed us in sheets, it was not known whether they were original or not. They appear in this book, therefore, in company with quite a number of original ones, without any special mark thus to designate them.  To the friends who have so kindly aided us, by suggestions or contributions, we return our sincere thanks; and to the Christian public do we now humbly dedicate this work, invoking the blessing of God upon its use, and praying that it may be welcomed by many souls seeking the aids and blessings of Christian devotion.
