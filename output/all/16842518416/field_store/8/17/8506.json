Oh dear!   They've made a mistake in the day of the year.     Piccaninnies     I.  CHRISTMAS TREE. (_Pohutukawa_).   Long ago the Piccaninnies didn't have a rag to their backs except a huia feather which they wore in their hair. They were the jolliest, tubbiest, brownest babies you ever saw with tiny nubbly knobs on their shoulders, as if they had started to grow wings and then changed their minds about it, and little furry pointed ears, as all wild creatures have. Only these were _not_ wild, but very, very shy.  Where did they live? Oh, just anywhere--all about; among the fern, in the long grass, down on the sands, in all the places babies love to roll about in.  And then _People_ began to come about, so tiresome! They began to make houses, sell things in shops, tear about in big boxes on wheels, and send great, clattering, shrieking, puffing monsters rushing through the country, dropping smoke and cinders like anything. There was such a clatter and a chatter, such gabbling and babbling, such hammering and banging and laughing and crying, and hurry and scurry and rush that it was enough to drive one crazy. There was such a _fuss_, the Piccaninnies simply couldn't stand it, and they fled to the Bush. Well, wouldn't you, with all that going on?  And there they lived a long time. What fun they had swinging on the giant fern leaves, climbing the trees, chasing the fantails, riding the kiwis, who are very good-natured, though shy, and teasing the great, sleepy round-eyed morepork, who is so stupid and _owlish_ in the daytime.  And then People came _into the Bush!_ Did you ever!  The Piccaninnies took to the trees altogether then, and no wonder!   II.  And then one day some one in a picnic party left a scrap of paper blowing about--you know the horrid way picnic parties have!--and a Piccaninny found it.  [Illustration: \"To be sure they were looking at the pictures upside down, but that made no real difference.\"]  As luck would have it, it was a girl Piccaninny; had it been a boy he would simply have torn it up and made paper darts with it to throw at the other boys, and no harm would have been done. _But girls are different!_  [Illustration: \"Teasing the great, sleepy, round-eyed morepork.\"]  She smoothed it out and looked at it carefully, and then she called the other girls to look at it. And soon there was such a clattering and chattering that the boys came racing that way to see if the girls had found anything good to eat. You know boys!  The scrap of paper was a page out of a fashion book, and there were pictures on it of horrid little smug-faced boys in sky-blue suits bowling hoops in a way no real little boy ever bowled a hoop in his life, and simpering little girls in lace frocks holding dolls or sun-shades in un-natural attitudes.  But the Piccaninnies were delighted. To be sure they were looking at the pictures upside down, but that made no real difference.  They decided they must have clothes too.  Of course the boys said pooh they wouldn't! It's much easier to slide down a fern-leaf, or jump off the end of a branch if you haven't any clothes--everyone knows that.  But when the girls, after being absent for hours, came back all in darling little crimson kilts made out of blossoms from the Christmas tree, the boys simply couldn't bear to think the girls had something they hadn't got. You know what boys are!  After laughing at the girls in the hopes they'd throw away their pretty little frocks, the boys went off together. They simply had to think of something, and it would never do to copy the girls. They came back later with the quaintest little breeches, made out of broad flax leaves, stitched together with the points downwards. It was clever of the boys! They had also stuck some of the red-brown flowers in their hair. The girls were vexed that they hadn't thought of that, but they went one better. They made strings of the scarlet nikau berries and hung them round their necks. (Trust the girls!)  And that was how Fashions came to be started in the Bush.  [Illustration]     CLEMATIS.   Of course fashions change, and no one need be surprised to find that crimson kilts were soon \"out,\" while the Piccaninny girls were to be seen walking about in pretty little white, frilly petticoats made out of clematis blossoms, and sun hats of the same flowers.  The hats were rather silly, because the Piccaninnies lived so deep in the Bush that the sun couldn't hurt them, but then fashions are absurd. (Look at the ladies who wear fur coats in hot climates!)  The boys made no change because their kind of fashion doesn't change, except sometimes you take great pains to iron the crease out of them, and other times you iron it _in_ most carefull-_ee_.  For some reason the boys didn't like the girls' change of frocks. Of course, they said, the girls would never play with them now, but the girls said oh yes, they would. The boys said:  \"You'd be scared to play berry fights like we used to.\"  But the girls said, as brave as could be:  \"Would we?\"  And the boys answered:  \"Let's see you then!\"  So they all ran off and collected puriri berries, big purply red ones, rather squashy. Then the boys all yelled in chorus:    _Ka mate! Ka mate! Ka ora! Ka ora!   Tenei te tangata puhuru huru   Na na nei i tiki mai--   whaka whiti te ra! Upane! Upane! Upane!   kaupani whiti te ra!_  which means something very warlike, and the girls answered shrilly:    _Ka whawhai tonu! Ake! Ake! Ake!_  They said that because they had heard that someone had said that sometime about something, and it means \"we will fight for ever and ever.\"  But they didn't! At the very first volley the berries stained their dainty frocks, and the girls fled, screaming angrily:  \"You horrid things! You've ruined our frocks!\"  And the boys grinning delightedly, and rolling their black eyes, thumped their little brown heels on the ground, and beat their little bare, brown knees and chanted all together:    \"_Akarana Mototapu Rangitoto Ra!_\"  And of course you all know what that means! You don't? Well, I'm not quite sure myself, because I couldn't find it in the dictionary (so careless of Mr. Webster!) but it really doesn't matter.  [Illustration]     CABBAGE PALM.  (Pickled Cabbages).   Little Swanki, the Piccaninny girl, and Tiki, the Piccaninny boy, were up in a karaka tree eating the pulp of the ripe berries. When I was young I was told I would die if I ate the karaka berries, but I suppose Piccaninny tummies are different.  Anyhow, there they were, skinning the soft yellow pulp, which _does_ took nice, off the hard inside of the berry with their sharp little white teeth, and throwing the hard part at a kiwi wandering about below their tree, and thinking it great fun to watch his surprised face as he tried to dodge the berries.  Swanki had just eaten her fourteenth berry and was reaching for the fifteenth, when she sighed discontentedly.  \"Oh, Tiki,\" she said, \"aren't you sick and tired of eating the same old foods for ever and ever? Berries--berries--berries! Roots--roots--roots! And only a few leaves that are worth eating.\"  But Tiki was a contented little boy, and he couldn't think of anything nicer to eat than a handful of ripe puriri berries, or the root of a young fern.  [Illustration: \"Oh, Tiki, aren't you sick of eating the same old foods for ever and ever!\"]  \"But what else could we eat?\" he asked, \"There isn't anything else!\"  \"Of course there is--lots and lots,\" answered Swanki. \"There's mince pie and ham sandwiches and jam tarts and vinegar and plum duff and cakes and pickled cabbages.\"  [Illustration: \"So they all ran off and collected puriri berries.\"]  Tiki stared at Swanki in amazement; he had never even heard of these foods, and thought she must be wonderfully clever to know all about them.  Sly little Swanki did not tell him that she had lately been hidden in a hollow tree stump near a picnic party which had come into the bush, and that she had heard the people offering these strange foods to one another, and they sounded as though they might be more interesting than just berries--berries--berries--roots--roots--roots.  And that is always the way,--something we haven't got always seems more worth having than the things we have.  When Tiki had recovered from his surprise he remembered one familiar word in Swanki's list of things to eat, and as he was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19962"],["title","Piccaninnies (#1)"],["body","ready to please, he said:  \"Swanki, I don't know where the mince pie and plum duff and--and vinegar trees grow, but I can show you the pickled cabbage trees all right.\"  \"Oh, Tiki, can you?\" cried Swanki. \"Then let's go at once. I'm longing for some pickled cabbage.\"  \"It's a long way,\" said Tiki, doubtfully, \"a long, long way to go;\" (though he'd never heard of the popular song, which shows how easy it must be to write those songs).  But Swanki said it didn't matter how far it was; the sooner they started, the sooner they'd be there, which was true in a way.  They slid down the tree, and having persuaded the kiwi to give them a lift, which was pretty cool of them, considering, they set off and travelled in fine style for some way.  But as they arrived near the edge of the bush and the trees grew thinner, the kiwi, who hates the open country for his own reasons, refused to go any farther, and the Piccaninnies had to get off and trudge the rest of the way on foot.  And crossing a little green glade they met Miss Fantail darting round and round the glade after flies. Now, Miss Fantail is a friendly and harmless little bird, but she's the most inquisitive creature in the bush, and a regular little gossip.  The Piccaninnies knew that if she got wind of where they were going it would soon be all over the bush, and they made up their minds to dodge her. So they pretended to be little brown lizards crawling through the moss, but Miss Fantail wasn't taken in for a moment, but flitted down to them and put her head on one side in her bright-eyed inquisitive way.  [Illustration: Miss Fantail, the most inquisitive creature in the bush.]  \"Now she'll begin to ask questions,\" muttered Swanki, and sure enough Miss Fantail began in her usual manner:  \"Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What? What? Where are you two off to? Whit! What are you after? What? When are you coming back? Why are you going so fast? Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What?\"  And when they wouldn't answer she persisted in following them, flitting in her restless way from tree to tree, sometimes darting ahead of them, sometimes circling round them, and never ceasing to cry inquisitively:  \"Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What? What?\"  On the very edge of the bush, however, she hesitated. She had been born in the bush, and was used only to its cool green shade, and the glare of the sun on the outside world rather scared her. So after hanging about for a time to see what the Piccaninnies intended doing, she flitted away after a large blue fly, and while she was busy Tiki and Swanki gave her the slip. They, too, had been rather dismayed at the glare of the sun and the shelterless look of the outside world, but Tiki said that the Pickled Cabbage trees were not far away; he had seen them once when he had climbed to the top of a rata tree, and a bush pigeon had told him the name of them.  So, shrinking a little and keeping a sharp look-out for enemies in case they had need to \"drop dead\" and pretend to be a dead stick or leaf, they ran on hand in hand, and came after a time to the edge of the swamp.  \"There!\" said Tiki proudly, \"there are the Pickled Cabbage trees.\"  There were quite a number of them, tall slim trees with long bare trunks and a crown of long, narrow leaves at the top.  \"We must climb to the top to find the cabbages,\" said Swanki; but though they had done a lot of climbing in their day, it was usually up trees with plenty of branches and twigs to help them.  They found it very hard to get a grip with their little, bare, brown knees on the long, smooth trunks, and Tiki frowned thoughtfully at his tree as he slid down for the fifth time.  \"You give me a leg up first,\" said Swanki, \"and when I'm up I'll give you one,\" which was rather a silly thing to say when you come to think of it.  However, you can do most things if you try hard enough, and Swanki, seeing how the last year's jackets of the cicadas, which they had quite grown out of, were clinging to the Cabbage trees with their tiny claws, slipped her hands and feet into a set of them and through this clever idea of hers was able to climb right up the trunk, followed by Tiki, who was busy all the time trying to explain that he had just been going to think of the plan himself.  When they were at last nestled in the crown of leaves they began to look about for the cabbages, but could find nothing resembling Swanki's idea of a cabbage, which wasn't very clear, but quite different from anything they found in that tree.  They nibbled some of the leaves which were bitter and stringy, and tried some of last year's flowers, which were very little better, and then Swanki cried out in disappointment:  \"You've played me a trick, Tiki. These are not cabbages.\"  She gave him an angry little push, and to her surprise he fell backward out of the tree splash into the swamp, where she saw him struggling in the muddy water.  Very frightened Swanki hurried down the tree and ran to the edge of the water, where she held out her hands to Tiki who grabbed them tightly.  But just as she was drawing him to land the boggy piece of ground on which she was standing gave way, and she, too, fell into the water.  Luckily it was not very deep, and a friendly old frog gave them a leg up the bank, and very wet and muddy and miserable they started back for the bush.  The worst of it was that tiresome Miss Fantail had spread it all abroad that they had left the bush, and on the way home they met her and all her relations, and all the Piccaninnies too, setting out on a search party.  [Illustration: \"To her surprise he fell backward out of the tree.\"]  How they stared and questioned and teased the poor little tired travellers, standing before them so wet and grimy and weary, and when they had heard the whole story how they all laughed at Swanki and Tiki!  And glad, indeed, were those two Piccaninnies to sit down to a delicious tea of fern root, young nikau, and assorted berries, and never again did any one hear Swanki complain of just \"berries--berries--berries--roots--roots--roots.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration: \" ... he rocked himself to sleep among the pretty little starry flowers.\"]     TEA TREE.   One of the Piccaninnies had a horrid adventure one day. He had heard a tui that morning singing in the Bush, and had made up his mind to speak to it, because he was sulking with the other Piccaninnies.  You know they say a tui can be made to talk, but it's hard to get near enough to one to find out, but perhaps if you did get close and surprised it, it would be so mad at you that it would _answer back_.  The Piccaninny followed his tui up and up, but it flitted from tree top to tree top, and he could hear it tolling a bell and cracking a whip, and chuckling at him, and finally it flew away, and that was the last of it.  The Piccaninny, tired out, climbed up into a tea tree bush, and swung himself gently to-and-fro until he rocked himself to sleep among the pretty little starry flowers, a thing he should never have done unless a Piccaninny Boy Scout had been posted near by in case of danger. He was _so_ drowsy, that he never heard a voice saying:  \"Oh! look here, George, this is a lovely spray!\" nor felt the spray on which he was sleeping torn from its mother-bush, and carried away. It was taken into a big room in a big house, and there on a big table it was placed in a silver vase.  It was then the Piccaninny woke up because the bough had ceased to sway gently up and down. At first he was very surprised, and then, poking his little brown head out, he was horribly frightened. Instead of the green leafy arch above him, he saw a flat white thing, and all around him were enormous strange objects. Craning out still farther he over-balanced himself and fell thud! upon a hard, polished flat plain. He tried to scramble to his feet, but the ground under him was so slippery that he could only crawl gingerly on all fours and flounder about on it.  Someone exclaimed suddenly:  \"Oh, look at that horrid brown insect. It must have come from the tea tree. Fetch the brush and dustpan.\"  And someone else cried excitedly:  \"Kill it! Kill it!\"  But a third someone said quite calmly:  \"Nonsense! It's quite harmless!\"  Then a huge bristly thing fell upon him, and smothered and gasping he felt himself swept along, and then flying through the air. Again he fell with a thud upon something hard, but it was only the hardness of the good brown earth, and the tall green grass closed protectingly over him.  You may be sure he lost no time in scuttling back to the bush, and he didn't hunt tuis again for many a long day.  [Illustration]     ~Bush Babies~     KOWHAI BLOSSOM.     _The Bush Babies lie   In cradles of gold;   They haven't a stitch,   But they never take cold;   For the golden flowers,   And the golden sun,   And the golden smiles   Upon everyone--   Keep the world warm and bright   And flooded with light   For the Bush Babies   In their cradles of gold._  The Bush Babies come out of the kowhai flowers. They are the prettiest little things--fair as lilies with golden ringlets, and little golden peaked caps, bent over like a horn upon their heads. I don't think they wear anything else much, just an odd little fluff of green here and there, like stray feathers that have stuck to them.  [Illustration: \"They haven't a stitch, But they never take cold.\"]  The Piccaninnies love to play with them; indeed, they're favourites with everyone, and it's the prettiest sight in the world at early morning, to see each Bush Baby crawling out of its cradle flower on its little tummy, yawning or smiling or stretching, or blinking at the light with round sleepy eyes.  But you would never get up early enough to see that.  They tell a story in the Bush about a Bush Baby and a Piccaninny--and laugh about it to this day. The Piccaninny told the Bush Baby that he would find some honey for her. Now the Bush Babies love honey better than anything else in the world, so she put her "]]]
