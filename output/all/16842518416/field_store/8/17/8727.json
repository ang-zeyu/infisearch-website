In other words, I think Tag, as you call him, will shape their stories to suit his own purposes.\"  \"And so you want to set a trap for him? All right! Go ahead, lad, and make what you can out of this mess. What do you think those visitors came here for at midnight? And do you believe they are responsible for the disappearance of Lieutenant Rowe and his companions?\"  \"Here comes Tag,\" Ned said. \"Suppose we wait and see what he says of the experiences of the fanmen.\"  The Filipino had in a measure recovered his good humor and was very respectful to the Captain. He addressed him instead of Ned when he spoke.  \"They say they were given drink after the fourth man arrived and went to sleep.\"  \"That accounts for the strange odor about the place!\" cried the Captain. \"Now, what the dickens does it all mean?\"  \"Cripes!\" broke in Jimmie. \"I wish I had as many dollars as times I don't know. Say, when we goin' to get a ride in the _Manhattan_? Me for the rollin' deep whenever you get this thing doped out.\"  \"It looks like we had work cut out for us here,\" Ned replied. \"Now, Captain,\" he went on, \"it looks as if the late arrivals last night drugged the servants and took the secret service men away by main force.\"  \"Main force!\" roared the Captain. \"Why didn't they shoot, or yell, or make some sort of a row that would have brought help? I've got a lot of old women here who could have stood off an attacking party! Force--nothing! Lieutenant Rowe was in the deal. He wanted to disappear with something he had in his possession, and he worked the abduction dodge.\"  \"You may be right,\" the boy replied, \"still, that does not change the fact that there were enough men about this hut last night to make just such a capture--with the assistance of a clever man on the inside--a man pretending to be friendly to the Lieutenant--say, for instance, the fourth man, or--Tag.\"  \"How do you know how many men there were about here?\" asked the Captain.  \"If you will go to the river bank a few rods south of the pier,\" was the reply, \"you will discover that a large canoe beached there last night. You will see that it was drawn far up into the thicket, a task which must have taxed the strength of at least eight men. Then, about the hut, and especially under the windows which the visitor entered, there are plenty of footprints.\"  \"Footprints!\" echoed the Captain. \"My people don't wear footgear that leaves prints!\"  \"There were at least three pair of European shoes in the group,\" Ned went on, \"Now, the next query is this: Why did the visitor enter by the window? If you will notice the floor in there, below the two front windows, you will see that the shades were drawn there last night, and that they were pulled down when this other wreck was produced and torn from the rollers.\"  \"I hadn't noticed that,\" the Captain said.  \"This shows that some one in this hut was expecting a visit, and also that the visit was to be kept a secret from you. The front windows overlook your quarters, and the window entered is the one most protected from view from your place. Now, this precaution may have been taken by the midnight visitor, coming here as a friend, or by an enemy, for the purpose of concealing from you what went on here.\"  \"And that is why the Lieutenant did not sleep under my roof!\" said the Captain. \"He was expecting the fellow. Well, what do you say, did the fellow betray his confidence and bring enemies to carry him away?\"  \"His friend might have been followed here,\" Ned replied. \"He might have been the person sought by the intruders. The next question is: Who was this visitor?\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE SIGNALS IN GRASS.   Captain Godwin turned to the Filipino.  \"Can you give us a description of him?\" he asked.  Tag shook his head.  \"I saw only his figure at the window,\" he said, \"and only for an instant. He was assisted in, and then after a time, the lights were lowered, or extinguished entirely.\"  \"So that is why you didn't loiter around!\" cried the Captain, \"You thought they had gone to bed! Are you sure you did not stop and listen to what was said?\"  \"I went to bed at once,\" was the sullen reply.  \"Did you see them burning matches after the lights were out?\" asked Ned.  \"I could not see the interior of the hut from my bed,\" replied the Filipino, with flashing eyes.  \"Well, don't get hot about it,\" advised the Captain. \"Go on, Ned.\"  \"The matches burned,\" Ned went on, \"were not of the kind kept in stock here, the sort supplied by you to your guests. There is a difference in the shape and size of the stick. The paper which I found in the alcove is part of an official letter dealing with the situation we came here to look into. It is more than half burned, so little can be learned from it.\"  \"It is a wonder they didn't see that it was entirely destroyed,\" suggested Frank.  \"It may be,\" Ned replied, \"that they intended to burn the hut after their departure, and left the paper blazing.\"  \"That is just about it!\" cried the Captain.  \"Then we have to take it for granted that the visitor came here with instructions for Lieutenant Rowe. Secret instructions, probably. He either betrayed his trust and assisted in what was done, or was followed here and attacked with the others. It is a great puzzle. One might ask a dozen questions without finding an answer. For instance: Why was the interior of the hut wrecked?\"  \"There was a fight, of course,\" Frank said.  \"And not a shot fired!\" cried the Captain. \"I don't believe it! A fight would have led to shooting; shooting would have attracted attention. No, sir, you will find that Lieutenant Rowe stood in with this game! Why should official communications follow so closely on his heels? If the officials who sent him here had anything to add to his orders, they might have sent a messenger on after him, of course, but there are no cables here, so he could not have been notified that the man was coming. Yet it is clear that he expected this man! Oh, he was in it, all right!\"  \"Did you size him up for that sort of a man?\" asked Ned.  \"I didn't see much of him,\" was the reply.  \"You may be right,\" Ned said, \"although I can't see why he came here at all if he was to make so sensational a disappearance.\"  \"He wasn't thinking of disappearing when he came here,\" insisted the Captain. \"Something in the instructions the fourth man brought changed his line of action. I'll bet my head on it!\"  \"Will you kindly talk with the two men who were put to sleep and see if they confirm the story told by Tag?\"  The Captain agreed to this, and went away to look the men up. He was back in a few minutes with the report that the men were not to be found.  \"They left just after talking with Tag,\" he added, looking angrily at the Filipino.  \"They said nothing to me of going,\" Tag hastened to say. \"They certainly were not alarmed at what took place under their noses last night.\"  \"Did they tell you who gave them the drink?\" asked Ned.  \"Yes; they said it was the fourth man.\"  \"And there you are!\" the Captain roared. \"The fourth man! It is a wonder he didn't stick a knife into them!\"  \"How old were the men with the Lieutenant?\" asked Ned. \"You said they were young fellows.\"  \"Well, they were tall and stoutish, but they looked young. Anywhere from sixteen to twenty, I should say.\"  \"Did you notice a locked box in the party?\"  \"No; they carried nothing of the kind.\"  \"They carried some baggage?\"  \"Yes; one suitcase. Came away in a hurry, they said. I saw the suitcase opened, on the table in there, and there was no box.\"  Ned took a thin, flat steel key from his pocket and held it out to the Captain. It was a key of peculiar construction, evidently made of individual pattern. In fact, it was such a key as usually goes with a strong cash box, having no duplicate.  \"This was not used to open the suitcase?\" he asked.  \"Certainly not,\" was the reply. \"Where did you find that?\"  \"On the river bank, where the canoe the men came in was beached,\" was the reply.  \"Well,\" observed the Captain, \"if we can't learn why they went away, or how, we may at least be able to discover where they went. Let us be about it.\"  \"Unfortunately,\" Ned replied, \"we can't track them through the waters of the channel. Water shows no footprints!\"  \"But they might not have gone away by water,\" insisted the other. \"If they had, they would have taken the motor boat.\"  \"They did send a man to get it,\" Ned replied, \"but he couldn't operate it. That is why it was out of order this morning.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"The man used matches there--the same kind of matches used in that room.\"  \"Some day,\" laughed Jimmie, \"some guy will come here an' move the bloomm' place away without bein' caught at it. Why didn't some one wake up?\"  \"I didn't wake up,\" said the Captain, \"but that is no proof that others did not. You can't trust these Filipinos. The people of the pueblo might have helped them away.\"  \"Exactly!\" said Ned.  \"If they left in a canoe,\" Frank suggested, \"we may be able to overtake them.\"  \"In this maze of islands!\" cried the Captain. \"I should say not.\"  \"We'll get a ride anyway,\" Jimmie observed.  \"If you'll tell Jack to get the _Manhattan_ ready,\" Ned said, \"we'll take a run out toward that rough-looking bit of land over there toward the coast of China.\"  The boy darted away, and Ned directed the Captain's steps to the spot where the canoe had been beached. After inspecting the thickets into which the canoe had been drawn when taken from the water, the two, Ned in the lead, pressed through the tangle which lined the bank until they came to a clear space strewn with food tins which had the appearance of having been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20208"],["title","Boy Scouts in the Philippines; Or, The Key to the Treaty Box (#5)"],["body","within a few hours.  \"They waited here,\" he said, \"and ate while they waited. I found the key here, and not at the point where the boat was pulled from the river. The box to which it belongs was opened here and new papers put into it. At least some papers which it had contained were removed. They were burned one by one in that thicket ahead.\"  The Captain looked Ned over from head to foot and laughed.  \"My boy,\" he said, \"you surely know what your eyes were given to you for. Can you tell by looking at my coat how much money I have in the pocketbook in the breast pocket?\"  \"Hardly,\" laughed Ned, \"but I can tell by looking at that light coat you have on that you went to sleep in your chair last night, with the lower part wrinkled up under you! Did you sleep that way all night? Own up, now!\"  Captain Godwin blushed through his coat of tan like a schoolgirl.  \"To tell you the truth,\" he said, \"I did sleep in my clothes last night. After I left the Lieutenant at the hut I went home and mixed a little drink and sat down to read a bit. Well, sir, I fell asleep!\"  \"And woke up at daylight?\" asked Ned.  \"Pretty close to it,\" was the reply. \"I awoke with a headache, too!\"  \"You mixed the drink yourself?\" asked the boy.  \"Yes; I always do.\"  \"But your servant brought the glass?\"  \"Why, yes.\"  \"Have you seen the servant to-day?\"  \"Sure! He got my early breakfast. We have two here, you know.\"  \"Ever sleep like that before?\"  \"Not here.\"  Ned looked serious. This was something new. The Captain had without doubt been drugged, but who had contrived the thing?  \"What are you getting at?\" demanded Captain Godwin. \"You don't think I was doped, do you?\"  \"Looks like it,\" was the reply.  \"Then the whole native population is up to something!\" shouted the Captain. \"I've noticed a good deal of whispering lately. Do you think the tribe on the island has gone over to the insurrectos?\"  \"I don't know,\" Ned said, \"but it seems to me that something is going to happen here before long.\"  \"I'll watch out,\" declared the Captain.  \"How long have you been in charge here?\" asked the boy.  \"Two years. There's really nothing to do, but Uncle Sam thinks he needs a man in charge here, and pays pretty well, and so I've remained. It is a dull life, and I'm not certain that I don't enjoy this little excitement.\"  \"Unless I am mistaken,\" Ned smiled, \"it will not be so dull here in the future. I see trouble for the whole group.\"  \"About a thousand of these brown leaders will have to be killed off before there will be any security of life or property here,\" said the Captain. \"The natives would behave themselves if let alone.\"  \"Now,\" Ned said, \"you have been insisting all along that Lieutenant Rowe voluntarily left the island. Let us see about that.\"  \"I never said he left the island. He may be here still, plotting with the natives, for all I know.\"  \"You are mistaken there. Whether voluntarily or not, his party left the island last night, with the men who came here in the canoe.\"  \"If he left the island, why didn't he go in the launch he came in? That would have been the most comfortable mode of leaving the place.\"  \"Because, as has been said, the man who was sent to seize the motor boat could not make it move.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"The fellow burned matches like those used In the hut as already stated, and threw the sticks about. He left the electric apparatus out of order, and that is why it would not run this morning when the Major wanted to use it.\"  \"Originally that might have been the reason,\" laughed the Captain, \"but I have an idea that the boys--\"  \"Never mind that!\" Ned said. \"We are not supposed to know anything about it. For if the Lieutenant had been a willing member of the party, wouldn't he have taken charge of the motor boat and got the party away in it?\"  \"Oh, all right! Have your own way about it!\" smiled the Captain. \"Let us suppose, solely for the sake of argument, that the Lieutenant was taken prisoner and went away against his will. Does that prove that he was taken from the island?\"  \"I was coming to that point,\" Ned replied.  He then called the attention of the Captain to the food tins which lay scattered about.  \"These tins,\" he said, \"have been opened within a few hours, which shows that the intruders rested and waited here and ate their suppers, perhaps their early breakfasts also. There were several of them, as you will see by the number of tins opened. The party embarked here. You can see where the nose of the canoe struck the mud.\"  \"I reckon, as I remarked before,\" the Captain said, \"that you don't need any instructions as to the use of your eyes! And the gray matter back of them seems to know what to do with the material unloaded on it! What next?\"  \"About the Lieutenant going away voluntarily,\" Ned went on. \"Now step down here to the river bank. You notice the footprints in the mud, close to the water's edge?\"  \"Yes; they are plain enough.\"  \"And some are heavy and some are light. See that? Some are faint impressions in the mushy soil, while some sink in a couple of inches. Some of the deep ones are clean cut, while others show that the foot wobbled in the track.\"  \"There must have been a fat man who was unsteady on his feet,\" observed the Captain.  \"Yes, there was a heavy man, but his tracks are cut sharply in the mud. His step was quick and firm. Now these other deep tracks show a staggering foot. What does that mean?\"  \"Blessed if I know!\" cried the Captain.  \"It means, to my mind, that the men who made these deep, wobbly tracks carried a burden into the boat. What do you think that burden was?\"  \"You will be telling me next that it was a wounded man--perhaps the Lieutenant himself,\" said the Captain, his face alive with interest.  \"It was a wounded man, all right,\" Ned replied, \"but we have no means of knowing whether it was the Lieutenant. See, there are drops of blood close to the margin of the river!\"  \"You're a genius!\" roared the Captain.  \"Just observation,\" Ned said modestly. \"There is nothing unusual about the faculty of seeing things. We all draw the same conclusions after the facts are pointed out. So, you see, there was a struggle in the hut, after all, and some one was cut with a knife, for there were no shots fired. As there would have been no fight if the Lieutenant had been in the game, as you express it, the inference is that he was taken prisoner.\"  \"Granted--for the sake of argument!\"  \"Now,\" Ned continued, \"you have seen Indian service, I understand, so you will no doubt recognize these signs in grass. Read them!\"  \"Sure I can read them,\" exclaimed the Captain, \"but I never would have discovered them. Indian signals in grass, eh? Now, who do you think put them there?\"  At the edge of the thicket were two bunches of grass, each tied tightly at a point near the top. On one the grass stood straight up beyond the band. On the other the top was bent toward the river.  \"'Here is the trail,'\" Captain Godwin read, pointing to the first one, \"and the trail leads this way,\" he added, pointing to the other. \"They left by the river!\"  \"There is one more,\" Ned said. \"Read this,\" pointing to three bunches of grass, each tied near the top and standing in a row.  \"That is a warning. It says, 'Be careful,'\" read the other. \"What does it mean?\"  \"Just what it says. It also means that there is a Boy Scout with the party!\"     CHAPTER V.  ON THE RIM OF THE CHINA SEA.   The rain fell heavily, persistently, provokingly. Now and then came a crash of thunder which seemed to shake the earth; vivid lightning cut zigzags in the murky sky. The little islands of the Babuyan group in the Balintang channel seemed to rock in the arms of the storm.  The motor boat _Manhattan_ lay tossing and drawing at her anchor in an obscure bay of tiny dimensions on the west coast of a small island which is a member of the Babuyan group and faces the China Sea. Ned, Frank, Jack and Jimmie sat sweating in the little cabin, which was in the back of the boat, the engine being located toward the center. The day was dark because of the clouds and the downpour of the rain, and the heavy foliage of the trees which came down to the very lip of the bay made it dim in the little cabin, but there was no artificial light.  The boys were waiting for the storm to subside. They knew the moods of the weather man of the Philippines well enough to understand that the rain was likely to continue for several days, it being the opening of the rainy season, but they preferred not to face the initial tempest. In a few hours comparative quiet would come, and there would be only the steady fall of rain.  Since leaving the little island where the transport had landed them, they had visited three little dots of land in the channel, and on each one they had found signals in grass pointing to the north and west.  \"That Boy Scout, whoever he is,\" Jimmie said, as they discussed the signals in the almost stifling atmosphere of the cabin, \"is strictly next to his job! He's showing the way, all right!\"  \"I'll bet you a can of corn against a bite of canned pie that he's from New York,\" Jack Bosworth observed.  \"Speaking of pie,\" Frank cut in, \"there's a little restaurant on Beekman street where they serve hot pies at noon for a dime. You go in there at twelve and get a peach pie, and an apple pie, and a berry pie, hot out of the oven, and buy a piece of cheese, and go back to the office and consume your frugal repast. What?\"  \"If you talk about hot pie here,\" Jack said, threateningly, \"I'll tip you out of the boat. Pie! When I go back to little old New York I'm going to have mother meet me at the pier with a pie under each arm!\"  \"I won't take your bet, Jack,\" Jimmie said. \"I'd lose. I know he's from New York, an' he belongs to the Wolf Patrol.\"  \"I thought you left your dream book at home!\" cried Frank.  \"There was a boy named Pat Mack,\" Jimmie went on, \"who enlisted and went to the Philippines a year ago. He was sixteen when he enlisted, but looked older, and so"]]]
