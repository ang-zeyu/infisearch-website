Preface.   In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers. I have done this, not with the intention of extending your knowledge, or even of pointing a moral, although the story is not without one; but simply for a change--a change both for you and myself, but frankly, more for myself than for you. You know the old story of the boy who bothered his brains with Euclid, until he came to dream regularly that he was an equilateral triangle enclosed in a circle. Well, I feel that unless I break away sometimes from history, I shall be haunted day and night by visions of men in armour, and soldiers of all ages and times.  If, when I am away on a holiday I come across the ruins of a castle, I find myself at once wondering how it could best have been attacked, and defended. If I stroll down to the Thames, I begin to plan schemes of crossing it in the face of an enemy; and if matters go on, who can say but that I may find myself, some day, arrested on the charge of surreptitiously entering the Tower of London, or effecting an escalade of the keep of Windsor Castle! To avoid such a misfortune--which would entail a total cessation of my stories, for a term of years--I have turned to a new subject, which I can only hope that you will find as interesting, if not as instructive, as the other books which I have written.  G. A. Henty.    Chapter 1: The Broken Window.   \"You are the most troublesome boy in the village, Reuben Whitney, and you will come to a bad end.\"  The words followed a shower of cuts with the cane. The speaker was an elderly man, the master of the village school of Tipping, near Lewes, in Sussex; and the words were elicited, in no small degree, by the vexation of the speaker at his inability to wring a cry from the boy whom he was striking. He was a lad of some thirteen years of age, with a face naturally bright and intelligent; but at present quivering with anger.  \"I don't care if I do,\" he said defiantly. \"It won't be my fault, but yours, and the rest of them.\"  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" the master said, \"instead of speaking in that way. You, who learn easier than anyone here, and could always be at the top of your class, if you chose. I had hoped better things of you, Reuben; but it's just the way, it's your bright boys as mostly gets into mischief.\"  At this moment the door of the school room opened, and a lady with two girls, one of about fourteen and the other eleven years of age, entered.  \"What is the matter now?\" the lady asked, seeing the schoolmaster, cane in hand, and the boy standing before him.  \"Reuben Whitney! What, in trouble again, Reuben? I am afraid you are a very troublesome boy.\"  \"I am not troublesome, ma'm,\" the boy said sturdily. \"That is, I wouldn't be if they would let me alone; but everything that is done bad, they put it down to me.\"  \"But what have you been doing now, Reuben?\"  \"I have done nothing at all, ma'm; but he's always down on me,\" and he pointed to the master, \"and when they are always down on a fellow, it's no use his trying to do right.\"  \"What has the boy been doing now, Mr. White?\" the lady asked.  \"Look there, ma'm, at those four windows all smashed, and the squire had all the broken panes mended only a fortnight ago.\"  \"How was it done, Mr. White?\"  \"By a big stone, ma'm, which caught the frame where they joined, and smashed them all.\"  \"I did not do it, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I didn't.\"  \"Why do you suppose it was Reuben?\" Mrs. Ellison asked the master.  \"Because I had kept him in, half an hour after the others went home to dinner, for pinching young Jones and making him call out; and he had only just gone out of the gate when I heard the smash; so there is no doubt about it, for all the others must have been in at their dinner at that time.\"  \"I didn't do it, ma'm,\" the boy repeated. \"Directly I got out of the gate, I started off to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards when I heard a smash; but I wasn't going for to stop to see what it was. It weren't no business of mine, and that's all I know about it.\"  \"Mamma,\" the younger of the two girls said eagerly, \"what he says is quite true. You know you let me run down the village with the jelly for Mrs. Thomson's child, and as I was coming down the road I saw a boy come out of the gate of the school and run away; and then I heard a noise of broken glass, and I saw another boy jump over the hedge opposite, and run, too. He came my way and, directly he saw me, he ran to a gate and climbed over.\"  \"Do you know who it was, Kate?\" Mrs. Ellison asked.  \"Yes, mamma. It was Tom Thorne.\"  \"Is Thomas Thorne here?\" Mrs. Ellison asked in a loud voice.  There was a general turning of the heads of the children to the point where a boy, somewhat bigger than the rest, had been apparently studying his lessons with great diligence.  \"Come here, Tom Thorne,\" Mrs. Ellison said.  The boy slouched up with a sullen face.  \"You hear what my daughter says, Tom. What have you to say in reply?\"  \"I didn't throw the stone at the window,\" the boy replied. \"I chucked it at a sparrow, and it weren't my fault if it missed him and broke the window.\"  \"I should say it was your fault, Tom,\" Mrs. Ellison said sharply--\"very much your fault, if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care to see what it may hit. But that is nothing to your fault in letting another boy be punished for what you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.  \"Mr. White, I will speak to you outside.\"  Followed by her daughters, Mrs. Ellison went out; Kate giving a little nod, in reply to the grateful look that Reuben Whitney cast towards her, and his muttered:  \"Thank you, miss.\"  \"Walk on, my dears,\" Mrs. Ellison said. \"I will overtake you, in a minute or two.  \"This will not do, Mr. White,\" she said, when she was alone with the master. \"I have told you before that I did not approve of your thrashing so much, and now it is proved that you punish without any sufficient cause, and upon suspicion only. I shall report the case at once to the squire and, unless I am greatly mistaken, you will have to look out for another place.\"  \"I am very sorry, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I am; and it is not often I use the cane, now. If it had been anyone else, I might have believed him; but Reuben Whitney is always in mischief.\"  \"No wonder he is in mischief,\" the lady said severely, \"if he is punished, without a hearing, for all the misdeeds of others. Well, I shall leave the matter in the squire's hands; but I am sure he will no more approve than I do of the children being ill treated.\"  Reuben Whitney was the son of a miller, near Tipping. John Whitney had been considered a well-to-do man, but he had speculated in corn and had got into difficulties; and his body was, one day, found floating in the mill dam. No one knew whether it was the result of intention or accident, but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt, and brought in a verdict of \"accidental death.\" He was but tenant of the mill and, when all the creditors were satisfied, there were only a few pounds remaining for the widow.  With these she opened a little shop in Tipping, with a miscellaneous collection of tinware and cheap ironmongery; cottons, tapes, and small articles of haberdashery; with toys, sweets, and cakes for the children. The profits were small, but the squire, who had known her husband, charged but a nominal rent for the cottage; and this was more than paid by the fruit trees in the garden, which also supplied her with potatoes and vegetables, so that she managed to support her boy and herself in tolerable comfort.  She herself had been the daughter of a tradesman in Lewes, and many wondered that she did not return to her father, upon her husband's death. But her home had not been a comfortable one, before her marriage; for her father had taken a second wife, and she did not get on well with her stepmother. She thought, therefore, that anything would be better than returning with her boy to a home where, to the mistress at least, she would be most unwelcome.  She had, as a girl, received an education which raised her somewhat above the other villagers of Tipping; and of an evening she was in the habit of helping Reuben with his lessons, and trying to correct the broadness of dialect which he picked up from the other boys. She was an active and bustling woman, managed her little shop well, and kept the garden, with Reuben's assistance, in excellent order.  Mrs. Ellison had, at her first arrival in the village three years before, done much to give her a good start, by ordering that all articles of use for the house, in which she dealt, should be purchased of her; and she highly approved of the energy and independence of the young widow. But lately there had been an estrangement between the squire's wife and the village shopkeeper. Mrs. Ellison, whose husband owned all the houses in the village, as well as the land surrounding it, was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20031"],["title","A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia (#1)"],["body","to speak her mind very freely to the wives of the villagers. She was kindness itself, in cases of illness or distress; and her kitchen supplied soups, jellies, and nourishing food to all who required it; but in return, Mrs. Ellison expected her lectures on waste, untidiness, and mismanagement to be listened to with respect and reverence.  She was, then, at once surprised and displeased when, two or three months before, having spoken sharply to Mrs. Whitney as to the alleged delinquencies of Reuben, she found herself decidedly, though not disrespectfully, replied to.  \"The other boys are always set against my Reuben,\" Mrs. Whitney said, \"because he is a stranger in the village, and has no father; and whatever is done, they throw it on to him. The boy is not a bad boy, ma'm--not in any way a bad boy. He may get into mischief, like the rest; but he is not a bit worse than others, not half as bad as some of them, and those who have told you that he is haven't told you the truth.\"  Mrs. Ellison had not liked it. She was not accustomed to be answered, except by excuses and apologies; and Mrs. Whitney's independent manner of speaking came upon her almost as an act of rebellion, in her own kingdom. She was too fair, however, to withdraw her custom from the shop; but from that time she had not, herself, entered it.  Reuben was a source of anxiety to his mother, but this had no reference to his conduct. She worried over his future. The receipts from the shop were sufficient for their wants; and indeed the widow was enabled, from time to time, to lay by a pound against bad times; but she did not see what she was to do with the boy. Almost all the other lads of the village, of the same age, were already in the fields; and Mrs. Whitney felt that she could not much longer keep him idle. The question was, what was she to do with him? That he should not go into the fields she was fully determined, and her great wish was to apprentice him to some trade; but as her father had recently died, she did not see how she was to set about it.  That evening, at dinner, Mrs. Ellison told the squire of the scene in the school room.  \"White must go,\" he said, \"that is quite evident. I have seen, for some time, that we wanted a younger man, more abreast of the times than White is; but I don't like turning him adrift altogether. He has been here upwards of thirty years. What am I to do with him?\"  Mrs. Ellison could make no suggestion; but she, too, disliked the thought of anyone in the village being turned adrift upon the world.  \"The very thing!\" the squire exclaimed, suddenly. \"We will make him clerk. Old Peters has long been past his work. The old man must be seventy-five, if he's a day, and his voice quavers so that it makes the boys laugh. We will pension him off. He can have his cottage rent free, and three or four shillings a week. I don't suppose it will be for many years. As for White, he cannot be much above sixty. He will fill the place very well.  \"I am sure the vicar will agree, for he has been speaking to me, about Peters being past his work, for the last five years. What do you say, my dear?\"  \"I think that will do very well, William,\" Mrs. Ellison replied, \"and will get over the difficulty altogether.\"  \"So you see, wife, for once that boy of Widow Whitney's was not to blame. I told you you took those stories on trust against him too readily. The boy's a bit of a pickle, no doubt; and I very near gave him a thrashing, myself, a fortnight since, for on going up to the seven-acre field, I found him riding bare backed on that young pony I intended for Kate.\"  \"You don't say so, William!\" Mrs. Ellison exclaimed, greatly shocked. \"I never heard of such an impudent thing. I really wonder you didn't thrash him.\"  \"Well, perhaps I should have done so, my dear; but the fact is, I caught sight of him some time before he saw me, and he was really sitting her so well that I could not find it in my heart to call out. He was really doing me a service. The pony had never been ridden, and was as wild as a wild goat. Thomas is too old, in fact, to break it in, and I should have had to get someone to do it, and pay him two or three pounds for the job.  \"It was not the first time the boy had been on her back, I could see. The pony was not quite broken and, just as I came on the scene, was trying its best to get rid of him; but it couldn't do it, and I could see, by the way he rode her about afterwards, that he had got her completely in hand; and a very pretty-going little thing she will turn out.\"  \"But what did you say to him, William? I am sure I should never stop to think whether he was breaking in the pony, or not, if I saw him riding it about.\"  \"I daresay not, my dear,\" the squire said, laughing; \"but then you see, you have never been a boy; and I have, and can make allowances. Many a pony and horse have I broken in, in my time; and have got on the back of more than one, without my father knowing anything about it.\"  \"Yes, but they were your father's horses, William,\" Mrs. Ellison persisted. \"That makes all the difference.\"  \"I don't suppose it would have made much difference to me,\" the squire laughed, \"at that time. I was too fond of horse flesh, even from a boy, to be particular whose horse it was I got across. However, of course, after waiting till he had done, I gave the young scamp a blowing up.\"  \"Not much of a blowing up, I am sure,\" Mrs. Ellison said; \"and as likely as not, a shilling at the end of it.\"  \"Well, Mary, I must own,\" the squire said pleasantly, \"that a shilling did find its way out of my pocket into his.\"  \"It's too bad of you, William,\" Mrs. Ellison said indignantly. \"Here is this boy, who is notoriously a scapegrace, has the impertinence to ride your horse, and you encourage him in his misdeeds by giving him a shilling.\"  \"Well, my dear, don't you see, I saved two pounds nineteen by the transaction.  \"Besides,\" he added more seriously, \"I think the boy has been maligned. I don't fancy he's a bad lad at all. A little mischief and so on, but none the worse for that. Besides, you know, I knew his father; and have sat many a time on horseback chatting to him, at the door of his mill; and drank more than one glass of good ale, which his wife has brought out to me. I am not altogether easy in my conscience about them. If there had been a subscription got up for the widow at his death, I should have put my name down for twenty pounds; and all that I have done for her is to take eighteen pence a week off that cottage of theirs.  \"No, I called the boy to me when he got off, and pretty scared he looked when he saw me. When he came up, I asked him how he dared to ride my horses about, without my leave. Of course he said he was sorry, which meant nothing; and he added, as a sort of excuse, that he used from a child to ride the horses at the mill down to the ford for water; and that his father generally had a young one or two, in that paddock of his by the mill, and he used often to ride them; and seeing the pony one day, galloping about the field and kicking up its heels, he wondered whether he could sit a horse still, and especially whether he could keep on that pony's back. Then he set to, to try.  \"The pony flung him several times, at first; and no wonder, as he had no saddle, and only a piece of old rope for a bridle; but he mastered him at last, and he assured me that he had never used the stick, and certainly he had not one when I saw him. I told him, of course, that he knew he ought not to have done it; but that, as he had taken it in hand, he might finish it. I said that I intended to have it broken in for Kate, and that he had best get a bit of sacking and put it on sideways, to accustom the pony to carry a lady. Then I gave him a shilling, and told him I would give him five more, when he could tell me the pony was sufficiently broken and gentle to carry Kate.\"  Mrs. Ellison shook her head in disapprobation.  \"It is of no use, William, my talking to the villagers as to the ways of their boys, if that is the way you counteract my advice.\"  \"But I don't always, my dear,\" the squire said blandly. \"For instance, I shall go round tomorrow morning with my dog whip to Thorne's; and I shall offer him the choice of giving that boy of his the soundest thrashing he ever had, while I stand by to see it, or of going out of his house at the end of the quarter.  \"I rather hope he will choose the latter alternative. That beer shop of his is the haunt of all the idle fellows in the village. I have a strong suspicion that he is in league with the poachers, if he doesn't poach himself; and the first opportunity I get of laying my finger upon him, out he goes.\"  A few days later when Kate Ellison issued from the gate of the house, which lay just at the end of the village, with the basket containing some jelly and medicine for a sick child, she found Reuben Whitney awaiting her. He touched his cap.  \"Please, miss, I made bold to come here, to thank you for having cleared me.\"  \"But I couldn't help clearing you, Reuben, for you see, I knew it wasn't you.\"  \"Well, miss, it was very kind, all the same; and I am very much obliged to you.\"  \"But why do you get into scrapes?\" the girl said. \"If you didn't, you wouldn't be suspected of other things. Mamma said, the other day, you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you look nice, too. Why do you do it?\"  \"I don't know why I do it, miss,\" Reuben said shamefacedly. \"I suppose it's because I don't go into the fields, like most of the other boys; and haven't got much to do. But there's no great harm in them, miss. They are just larks, nothing worse.\"  \"You don't do really bad things?\" the girl asked.  \"No, miss, I hope not.\"  \"And you don't tell stories, do you?\"  \"No, miss, never. If I do anything and I am asked, I always own it. I wouldn't tell a lie to save myself from a licking.\"  \"That's right,\" the girl said graciously.  She caught somewhat of her mother's manner,"]]]
