I merely say this by the way, good brother.    ORGON   You are the sole expounder of the doctrine;   Wisdom shall die with you, no doubt, good brother,   You are the only wise, the sole enlightened,   The oracle, the Cato, of our age.   All men, compared to you, are downright fools.    CLEANTE   I'm not the sole expounder of the doctrine,   And wisdom shall not die with me, good brother.   But this I know, though it be all my knowledge,   That there's a difference 'twixt false and true.   And as I find no kind of hero more   To be admired than men of true religion,   Nothing more noble or more beautiful   Than is the holy zeal of true devoutness;   Just so I think there's naught more odious   Than whited sepulchres of outward unction,   Those barefaced charlatans, those hireling zealots,   Whose sacrilegious, treacherous pretence   Deceives at will, and with impunity   Makes mockery of all that men hold sacred;   Men who, enslaved to selfish interests,   Make trade and merchandise of godliness,   And try to purchase influence and office   With false eye-rollings and affected raptures;   Those men, I say, who with uncommon zeal   Seek their own fortunes on the road to heaven;   Who, skilled in prayer, have always much to ask,   And live at court to preach retirement;   Who reconcile religion with their vices,   Are quick to anger, vengeful, faithless, tricky,   And, to destroy a man, will have the boldness   To call their private grudge the cause of heaven;   All the more dangerous, since in their anger   They use against us weapons men revere,   And since they make the world applaud their passion,   And seek to stab us with a sacred sword.   There are too many of this canting kind.   Still, the sincere are easy to distinguish;   And many splendid patterns may be found,   In our own time, before our very eyes   Look at Ariston, Periandre, Oronte,   Alcidamas, Clitandre, and Polydore;   No one denies their claim to true religion;   Yet they're no braggadocios of virtue,   They do not make insufferable display,   And their religion's human, tractable;   They are not always judging all our actions,   They'd think such judgment savoured of presumption;   And, leaving pride of words to other men,   'Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours.   Evil appearances find little credit   With them; they even incline to think the best   Of others. No caballers, no intriguers,   They mind the business of their own right living.   They don't attack a sinner tooth and nail,   For sin's the only object of their hatred;   Nor are they over-zealous to attempt   Far more in heaven's behalf than heaven would have 'em.   That is my kind of man, that is true living,   That is the pattern we should set ourselves.   Your fellow was not fashioned on this model;   You're quite sincere in boasting of his zeal;   But you're deceived, I think, by false pretences.    ORGON   My dear good brother-in-law, have you quite done?    CLEANTE   Yes.    ORGON   I'm your humble servant.    (Starts to go.)    CLEANTE   Just a word.   We'll drop that other subject. But you know   Valere has had the promise of your daughter.    ORGON   Yes.    CLEANTE   You had named the happy day.    ORGON   'Tis true.    CLEANTE   Then why put off the celebration of it?    ORGON   I can't say.    CLEANTE   Can you have some other plan   In mind?    ORGON   Perhaps.    CLEANTE   You mean to break your word?    ORGON   I don't say that.    CLEANTE   I hope no obstacle   Can keep you from performing what you've promised.    ORGON   Well, that depends.    CLEANTE   Why must you beat about?   Valere has sent me here to settle matters.    ORGON   Heaven be praised!    CLEANTE   What answer shall I take him?    ORGON   Why, anything you please.    CLEANTE   But we must know   Your plans. What are they?    ORGON   I shall do the will   Of Heaven.    CLEANTE   Come, be serious. You've given   Your promise to Valere. Now will you keep it?    ORGON   Good-bye.    CLEANTE (alone)   His love, methinks, has much to fear;   I must go let him know what's happening here.       ACT II      SCENE I    ORGON, MARIANE     ORGON   Now, Mariane.    MARIANE   Yes, father?    ORGON   Come; I'll tell you   A secret.    MARIANE   Yes ... What are you looking for?    ORGON (looking into a small closet-room)   To see there's no one there to spy upon us;   That little closet's mighty fit to hide in.   There! We're all right now. Mariane, in you   I've always found a daughter dutiful   And gentle. So I've always love you dearly.    MARIANE   I'm grateful for your fatherly affection.    ORGON   Well spoken, daughter. Now, prove you deserve it   By doing as I wish in all respects.    MARIANE   To do so is the height of my ambition.    ORGON   Excellent well. What say you of--Tartuffe?    MARIANE   Who? I?    ORGON   Yes, you. Look to it how you answer.    MARIANE   Why! I'll say of him--anything you please.      SCENE II    ORGON, MARIANE, DORINE (coming in quietly and standing behind   Orgon, so that he does not see her)     ORGON   Well spoken. A good girl. Say then, my daughter,   That all his person shines with noble merit,   That he has won your heart, and you would like   To have him, by my choice, become your husband.   Eh?    MARIANE   Eh?    ORGON   What say you?    MARIANE   Please, what did you say?    ORGON   What?    MARIANE   Surely I mistook you, sir?    ORGON   How now?    MARIANE   Who is it, father, you would have me say   Has won my heart, and I would like to have   Become my husband, by your choice?    ORGON   Tartuffe.    MARIANE   But, father, I protest it isn't true!   Why should you make me tell this dreadful lie?    ORGON   Because I mean to have it be the truth.   Let this suffice for you: I've settled it.    MARIANE   What, father, you would ... ?    ORGON   Yes, child, I'm resolved   To graft Tartuffe into my family.   So he must be your husband. That I've settled.   And since your duty ..    (Seeing Dorine)   What are you doing there?   Your curiosity is keen, my girl,   To make you come eavesdropping on us so.    DORINE   Upon my word, I don't know how the rumour   Got started--if 'twas guess-work or mere chance   But I had heard already of this match,   And treated it as utter stuff and nonsense.    ORGON   What! Is the thing incredible?    DORINE   So much so   I don't believe it even from yourself, sir.    ORGON   I know a way to make you credit it.    DORINE   No, no, you're telling us a fairly tale!    ORGON   I'm telling you just what will happen shortly.    DORINE   Stuff!    ORGON   Daughter, what I say is in good earnest.    DORINE   There, there, don't take your father seriously;   He's fooling.    ORGON   But I tell you ...    DORINE   No. No use.   They won't believe you.    ORGON   If I let my anger ...    DORINE   Well, then, we do believe you; and the worse   For you it is. What! Can a grown-up man   With that expanse of beard across his face   Be mad enough to want ...?    ORGON   You hark me:   You've taken on yourself here in this house   A sort of free familiarity   That I don't like, I tell you frankly, girl.    DORINE   There, there, let's not get angry, sir, I beg you.   But are you making game of everybody?   Your daughter's not cut out for bigot's meat;   And he has more important things to think of.   Besides, what can you gain by such a match?   How can a man of wealth, like you, go choose   A wretched vagabond for son-in-law?    ORGON   You hold your tongue. And know, the less he has,   The better cause have we to honour him.   His poverty is honest poverty;   It should exalt him more than worldly grandeur,   For he has let himself be robbed of all,   Through careless disregard of temporal things   And fixed attachment to the things eternal.   My help may set him on his feet again,   Win back his property--a fair estate   He has at home, so I'm informed--and prove him   For what he is, a true-born gentleman.    DORINE   Yes, so he says himself. Such vanity   But ill accords with pious living, sir.   The man who cares for holiness alone   Should not so loudly boast his name and birth;   The humble ways of genuine devoutness   Brook not so much display of earthly pride.   Why should he be so vain? ... But I offend you:   Let's leave his rank, then,--take the man himself:   Can you without compunction give a man   Like him possession of a girl like her?   Think what a scandal's sure to come of it!   Virtue is at the mercy of the fates,   When a girl's married to a man she hates;   The best intent to live an honest woman   Depends upon the husband's being human,   And men whose brows are pointed at afar   May thank themselves their wives are what they are.   For to be true is more than woman can,   With husbands built upon a certain plan;   And he who weds his child against her will   Owes heaven account for it, if she do ill.   Think then what perils wait on your design.    ORGON (to Mariane)   So! I must learn what's what from her, you see!    DORINE   You might do worse than follow my advice.    ORGON   Daughter, we can't waste time upon this nonsense;   I know what's good for you, and I'm your father.   True, I had promised you to young Valere;   But, first, they tell me he's inclined to gamble,   And then, I fear his faith is not quite sound.   I haven't noticed that he's regular   At church.    DORINE   You'd have him run there just when you do.   Like those who go on purpose to be seen?    ORGON   I don't ask your opinion on the matter.   In short, the other is in Heaven's best graces,   And that is riches quite beyond compare.   This match will bring you every joy you long for;   'Twill be all steeped in sweetness and delight.   You'll live together, in your faithful loves,   Like two sweet children, like two turtle-doves;   You'll never fail to quarrel, scold, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2027"],["title","Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite (#3)"],["body","ase,   And you may do with him whate'er you please.    DORINE   With him? Do naught but give him horns, I'll warrant.    ORGON   Out on thee, wench!    DORINE   I tell you he's cut out for't;   However great your daughter's virtue, sir,   His destiny is sure to prove the stronger.    ORGON   Have done with interrupting. Hold your tongue.   Don't poke your nose in other people's business.    DORINE (She keeps interrupting him, just as he turns and starts   to speak to his daughter).   If I make bold, sir, 'tis for your own good.    ORGON   You're too officious; pray you, hold your tongue.    DORINE   'Tis love of you ...    ORGON   I want none of your love.    DORINE   Then I will love you in your own despite.    ORGON   You will, eh?    DORINE   Yes, your honour's dear to me;   I can't endure to see you made the butt   Of all men's ridicule.    ORGON   Won't you be still?    DORINE   'Twould be a sin to let you make this match.    ORGON   Won't you be still, I say, you impudent viper!    DORINE   What! you are pious, and you lose your temper?    ORGON   I'm all wrought up, with your confounded nonsense;   Now, once for all, I tell you hold your tongue.    DORINE   Then mum's the word; I'll take it out in thinking.    ORGON   Think all you please; but not a syllable   To me about it, or ... you understand!    (Turning to his daughter.)   As a wise father, I've considered all   With due deliberation.    DORINE   I'll go mad   If I can't speak.   (She stops the instant he turns his head.)    ORGON   Though he's no lady's man,   Tartuffe is well enough ...    DORINE   A pretty phiz!    ORGON   So that, although you may not care at all   For his best qualities ...    DORINE   A handsome dowry!    (Orgon turns and stands in front of her, with arms folded, eyeing   her.)   Were I in her place, any man should rue it   Who married me by force, that's mighty certain;   I'd let him know, and that within a week,   A woman's vengeance isn't far to seek.    ORGON (to Dorine)   So--nothing that I say has any weight?    DORINE   Eh? What's wrong now? I didn't speak to you.    ORGON   What were you doing?    DORINE   Talking to myself.    ORGON   Oh! Very well. (Aside.) Her monstrous impudence   Must be chastised with one good slap in the face.    (He stands ready to strike her, and, each time he speaks to his   daughter, he glances toward her; but she stands still and says not a   word.) [3]    [Footnote 3: As given at the Comedie francaise, the action is as   follows: While Orgon says, \"You must approve of my design,\" Dorine is   making signs to Mariane to resist his orders; Orgon turns around   suddenly; but Dorine quickly changes her gesture and with the hand   which she had lifted calmly arranges her hair and her cap. Orgon goes   on, \"Think of the husband ...\" and stops before the middle of his   sentence to turn and catch the beginning of Dorine's gesture; but he   is too quick this time, and Dorine stands looking at his furious   countenance with a sweet and gentle expression. He turns and goes on,   and the obstinate Dorine again lifts her hand behind his shoulder to   urge Mariane to resistance: this time he catches her; but just as he   swings his shoulder to give her the promised blow, she stops him by   changing the intent of her gesture, and carefully picking from the top   of his sleeve a bit of fluff which she holds carefully between her   fingers, then blows into the air, and watches intently as it floats   away. Orgon is paralysed by her innocence of expression, and compelled   to hide his rage.--Regnier, _Le Tartuffe des Comediens_.]    ORGON   Daughter, you must approve of my design....   Think of this husband ... I have chosen for you...    (To Dorine)   Why don't you talk to yourself?    DORINE   Nothing to say.    ORGON   One little word more.    DORINE   Oh, no, thanks. Not now.    ORGON   Sure, I'd have caught you.    DORINE   Faith, I'm no such fool.    ORGON   So, daughter, now obedience is the word;   You must accept my choice with reverence.    DORINE (running away)   You'd never catch me marrying such a creature.    ORGON (swinging his hand at her and missing her)   Daughter, you've such a pestilent hussy there   I can't live with her longer, without sin.   I can't discuss things in the state I'm in.   My mind's so flustered by her insolent talk,   To calm myself, I must go take a walk.      SCENE III    MARIANE, DORINE     DORINE   Say, have you lost the tongue from out your head?   And must I speak your role from A to Zed?   You let them broach a project that's absurd,   And don't oppose it with a single word!    MARIANE   What can I do? My father is the master.    DORINE   Do? Everything, to ward off such disaster.    MARIANE   But what?    DORINE   Tell him one doesn't love by proxy;   Tell him you'll marry for yourself, not him;   Since you're the one for whom the thing is done,   You are the one, not he, the man must please;   If his Tartuffe has charmed him so, why let him   Just marry him himself--no one will hinder.    MARIANE   A father's rights are such, it seems to me,   That I could never dare to say a word.    DORINE   Came, talk it out. Valere has asked your hand:   Now do you love him, pray, or do you not?    MARIANE   Dorine! How can you wrong my love so much,   And ask me such a question? Have I not   A hundred times laid bare my heart to you?   Do you know how ardently I love him?    DORINE   How do I know if heart and words agree,   And if in honest truth you really love him?    MARIANE   Dorine, you wrong me greatly if you doubt it;   I've shown my inmost feelings, all too plainly.    DORINE   So then, you love him?    MARIANE   Yes, devotedly.    DORINE   And he returns your love, apparently?    MARIANE   I think so.    DORINE   And you both alike are eager   To be well married to each other?    MARIANE   Surely.    DORINE   Then what's your plan about this other match?    MARIANE   To kill myself, if it is forced upon me.    DORINE   Good! That's a remedy I hadn't thought of.   Just die, and everything will be all right.   This medicine is marvellous, indeed!   It drives me mad to hear folk talk such nonsense.    MARIANE   Oh dear, Dorine you get in such a temper!   You have no sympathy for people's troubles.    DORINE   I have no sympathy when folk talk nonsense,   And flatten out as you do, at a pinch.    MARIANE   But what can you expect?--if one is timid?--    DORINE   But what is love worth, if it has no courage?    MARIANE   Am I not constant in my love for him?   Is't not his place to win me from my father?    DORINE   But if your father is a crazy fool,   And quite bewitched with his Tartuffe? And breaks   His bounden word? Is that your lover's fault?    MARIANE   But shall I publicly refuse and scorn   This match, and make it plain that I'm in love?   Shall I cast off for him, whate'er he be,   Womanly modesty and filial duty?   You ask me to display my love in public ... ?    DORINE   No, no, I ask you nothing. You shall be   Mister Tartuffe's; why, now I think of it,   I should be wrong to turn you from this marriage.   What cause can I have to oppose your wishes?   So fine a match! An excellent good match!   Mister Tartuffe! Oh ho! No mean proposal!   Mister Tartuffe, sure, take it all in all,   Is not a man to sneeze at--oh, by no means!   'Tis no small luck to be his happy spouse.   The whole world joins to sing his praise already;   He's noble--in his parish; handsome too;   Red ears and high complexion--oh, my lud!   You'll be too happy, sure, with him for husband.    MARIANE   Oh dear! ...    DORINE   What joy and pride will fill your heart   To be the bride of such a handsome fellow!    MARIANE   Oh, stop, I beg you; try to find some way   To help break off the match. I quite give in,   I'm ready to do anything you say.    DORINE   No, no, a daughter must obey her father,   Though he should want to make her wed a monkey.   Besides, your fate is fine. What could be better!   You'll take the stage-coach to his little village,   And find it full of uncles and of cousins,   Whose conversation will delight you. Then   You'll be presented in their best society.   You'll even go to call, by way of welcome,   On Mrs. Bailiff, Mrs. Tax-Collector,   Who'll patronise you with a folding-stool.   There, once a year, at carnival, you'll have   Perhaps--a ball; with orchestra--two bag-pipes;   And sometimes a trained ape, and Punch and Judy;   Though if your husband ...    MARIANE   Oh, you'll kill me. Please   Contrive to help me out with your advice.    DORINE   I thank you kindly.    MARIANE   Oh! Dorine, I beg you ...    DORINE   To serve you right, this marriage must go through.    MARIANE   Dear girl!    DORINE   No.    MARIANE   If I say I love Valere ...    DORINE   No, no. Tartuffe's your man, and you shall taste him.    MARIANE   You know I've always trusted you; now help me ...    DORINE   No, you shall be, my faith! Tartuffified.    MARIANE   Well, then, since you've no pity for my fate   Let me take counsel only of despair;   It will advise and help and give me courage;   There's one sure cure, I know, for all my troubles.    (She starts to go.)    DORINE   There, there! Come back. I can't be angry long.   I must take pity on you, after all.    MARIANE   Oh, don't you see, Dorine, if I must bear   This martyrdom, I certainly shall die.    DORINE   Now don't you fret. We'll surely find some way.   To hinder this ... But here's Valere, your lover.      SCENE IV    VALERE, MARIANE, DORINE     VALERE   Madam, a piece of news--quite new to me--   Has just come out, and very fine it is.    MARIANE   What piece of news?    VALERE   Your marriage with Tartuffe.    MARIANE   'Tis true my father has this plan in mind.    VALERE   Your father, madam ...    MARIANE   Yes, he's changed his plans,   And did but now propose it to me.    VALERE   What!   Seriously?    MARIANE   Yes, he was serious,   And openly insisted on the match.    VALERE   And what's your resolution"]]]
