After he had been liberated, \"par la grace de Dieu donnee a Mess^rs^ de Berne,\" he returned to Geneva, and was made a member of the Council of the State, and awarded a house and a pension of two hundred crowns a year. A long life was before him, which he proceeded to spend in characteristic fashion, finely and honourably as scholar, author, and reformer, but with little self-regard or self-respect as a private citizen. He was married no less than four times, and not one of these alliances was altogether satisfactory or creditable. Determined \"to warm both hands before the fire of life,\" he was prone to ignore the prejudices and even the decencies of his fellow-citizens, now incurring their displeasure, and now again, as one who had greatly testified for truth and freedom, being taken back into favour and forgiven. There was a deal of human nature in Bonivard, with the result that, at times, conduct fell short of pretension and principle. Estimates of his character differ widely. From the standpoint of Catholic orthodoxy, \"C'était un fort mauvais sujet et un plus mauvais prêtre;\" and even his captivity, infamous as it was, \"ne peut rendre Bonivard intéressant\" (_Notices Généalogiques sur les Famillies Genevoises_, par J. A. Galiffe, 1836, iii. 67, sq.); whilst an advocate and champion, the author of the _Preface_ to _Les Chroniques de Genève_ par François de Bonnivard, 1831, tom. i. pt. i. p. xli., avows that \"aucun homme n'a fait preuve d'un plus beau caractère, d'un plus parfait désintéressement que l'illustre Prieur de St. Victor.\" Like other great men, he may have been guilty of \"quelques égaremens du coeur, quelques concessions passagères aux dévices des sens,\" but \"Peu importe à la postérité les irrégularités de leur vie privée\" (p. xlviii.).  But whatever may be the final verdict with regard to the morals, there can be no question as to the intellectual powers of the \"Prisoner of Chillon.\" The publication of various MS. tracts, e.g. _Advis et Devis de l'ancienne et nouvelle Police de Genève_, 1865; _Advis et Devis des Lengnes_, etc., 1865, which were edited by the late J. J. Chaponnière, and, after his death, by M. Gustave Revilliod, has placed his reputation as historian, satirist, philosopher, beyond doubt or cavil. One quotation must suffice. He is contrasting the Protestants with the Catholics (_Advis et Devis de la Source de Lidolatrie_, Geneva, 1856, p. 159): \"Et nous disons que les prebstres rongent les mortz et est vray; mais nous faisons bien pys, car nous rongeons les vifz. Quel profit revient aux paveures du dommage des prebstres? Nous nous ventons touttes les deux parties de prescher Christ cruciffie et disons vray, car nous le laissons cruciffie et nud en l'arbre de la croix, et jouons a beaux dez au pied dicelle croix, pour scavoir qui haura sa robe.\"  For Bonivard's account of his second imprisonment, see _Les Chroniques de Genève_, tom. ii. part ii. pp. 571-577; see, too, _Notice sur François Bonivard_, ...par Le Docteur J. J. Chaponnière, Mémoires et Documents Publiés, par La Société d'Histoire, etc., de Genève, 1845, iv. 137-245; _Chillon Etude Historique_, par L.

With the exception of the _Eclectic_ (March, 1817, N.S., vol. vii. pp. 298-304), the lesser reviews were unfavourable. For instance, the _Critical Review_ (December, 1816, Series V. vol. iv. pp. 567-581) detected the direct but unacknowledged influence of Wordsworth on thought and style; and the _Portfolio_ (No. vi. pp. 121-128), in an elaborate skit, entitled \"Literary Frauds,\" assumed, and affected to prove, that the entire poem was a forgery, and belonged to the same category as _The Right Honourable Lord Byron's Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, etc._  For extracts from these and other reviews, see Kölbing, _Prisoner of Chillon, and Other Poems_, Weimar, 1896, excursus i. pp. 3-55.

Chillon! thy prison is a holy place,       And thy sad floor an altar--for 'twas trod,     Until his very steps have left a trace       Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod,     By Bonnivard!--May none those marks efface!       For they appeal from tyranny to God.[2]                                    ADVERTISEMENT  When this poem[a] was composed, I was not sufficiently aware of the history of Bonnivard, or I should have endeavoured to dignify the subject by an attempt to celebrate his courage and his virtues. With some account of his life I have been furnished, by the kindness of a citizen of that republic, which is still proud of the memory of a man worthy of the best age of ancient freedom:--  \"François De Bonnivard, fils de Louis De Bonnivard, originaire de Seyssel et Seigneur de Lunes, naquit en 1496. Il fit ses études à Turin: en 1510 Jean Aimé de Bonnivard, son oncle, lui résigna le Prieuré de St. Victor, qui aboutissoit aux murs de Genève, et qui formait un bénéfice considérable....  \"Ce grand homme--(Bonnivard mérite ce litre par la force de son âme, la droiture de son coeur, la noblesse de ses intentions, la sagesse de ses conseils, le courage de ses démarches, l'étendue de ses connaissances, et la vivacité de son esprit),--ce grand homme, qui excitera l'admiration de tous ceux qu'une vertu héroïque peut encore émouvoir, inspirera encore la plus vive reconnaissance dans les coeurs des Genevois qui aiment Genève. Bonnivard en fut toujours un des plus fermes appuis: pour assurer la liberté de notre République, il ne craignit pas de perdre souvent la sienne; il oublia son repos; il méprisa ses richesses; il ne négligea rien pour affermir le bonheur d'une patrie qu'il honora de son choix: dès ce moment il la chérit comme le plus zélé de ses citoyens; il la servit avec l'intrépidité d'un héros, et il écrivit son Histoire avec la naïveté d'un philosophe et la chaleur d'un patriote.  \"Il dit dans le commencement de son Histoire de Genève, que, _dès qu'il eut commencé de lire l'histoire des nations, il se sentit entraîné par son goût pour les Républiques, dont il épousa toujours les intérêts:_ c'est ce goût pour la liberté qui lui fit sans doute adopter Genève pour sa patrie....  \"Bonnivard, encore jeune, s'annonça hautement comme le défenseur de Genève contre le Duc de Savoye et l'Evêque....  \"En 1519, Bonnivard devient le martyr de sa patrie: Le Duc de Savoye étant entré dans Genève avec cinq cent hommes, Bonnivard craint le ressentiment du Duc; il voulut se retirer à Fribourg pour en éviter les suites; mais il fut trahi par deux hommes qui l'accompagnaient, et conduit par ordre du Prince à Grolée, où il resta prisonnier pendant deux ans. Bonnivard était malheureux dans ses voyages: comme ses malheurs n'avaient point ralenti son zèle pour Genève, il était toujours un ennemi redoutable pour ceux qui la menaçaient, et par conséquent il devait être exposé à leurs coups. Il fut rencontré en 1530 sur le Jura par des voleurs, qui le dépouillèrent, et qui le mirent encore entre les mains du Duc de Savoye: ce Prince le fit enfermer dans le Château de Chillon, où il resta sans être interrogé jusques en 1536; il fut alors delivré par les Bernois, qui s'emparèrent du Pays-de-Vaud.  \"Bonnivard, en sortant de sa captivité, eut le plaisir de trouver Genève libre et réformée: la République s'empressa de lui témoigner sa reconnaissance, et de le dédommager des maux qu'il avoit soufferts; elle le reçut Bourgeois de la ville au mois de Juin, 1536; elle lui donna la maison habitée autrefois par le Vicaire-Général, et elle lui assigna une pension de deux cent écus d'or tant qu'il séjournerait à Genève. Il fut admis dans le Conseil des Deux-Cent en 1537.  \"Bonnivard n'a pas fini d'être utile: après avoir travaillé à rendre Genève libre, il réussit à la rendre tolérante. Bonnivard engagea le Conseil à accorder [aux ecclésiastiques et aux paysans] un tems suffisant pour examiner les propositions qu'on leur faisait; il réussit par sa douceur: on prêche toujours le Christianisme avec succès quand on le prêche avec charité....  \"Bonnivard fut savant: ses manuscrits, qui sont dans la bibliothèque publique, prouvent qu'il avait bien lu les auteurs classiques Latins, et qu'il avait approfondi la théologie et l'histoire. Ce grand homme aimait les sciences, et il croyait qu'elles pouvaient faire la gloire de Genève; aussi il ne négligea rien pour les fixer dans cette ville naissante; en 1551 il donna sa bibliothèque au public; elle fut le commencement de notre bibliothèque publique; et ces livres sont en partie les rares et belles éditions du quinzième siècle qu'on voit dans notre collection. Enfin, pendant la même année, ce bon patriote institua la République son héritière, à condition qu'elle employerait ses biens à entretenir le collège dont on projettait la fondation.  \"Il parait que Bonnivard mourut en 1570; mais on ne peut l'assurer, parcequ'il y a une lacune dans le Nécrologe"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20158"],["title","The Works of Lord Byron.

My hair is grey, but not with years,     Nor grew it white         In a single night,[3]     As men's have grown from sudden fears:     My limbs are bowed, though not with toil,       But rusted with a vile repose,[b]     For they have been a dungeon's spoil,       And mine has been the fate of those     To whom the goodly earth and air     Are banned,[4] and barred--forbidden fare;                         10     But this was for my father's faith     I suffered chains and courted death;     That father perished at the stake     For tenets he would not forsake;     And for the same his lineal race     In darkness found a dwelling place;     We were seven--who now are one,[5]       Six in youth, and one in age,     Finished as they had begun,       Proud of Persecution's rage;[c]                                  20     One in fire, and two in field,     Their belief with blood have sealed,     Dying as their father died,     For the God their foes denied;--     Three were in a dungeon cast,     Of whom this wreck is left the last.                          II.      There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,[6]     In Chillon's dungeons deep and old,     There are seven columns, massy and grey,     Dim with a dull imprisoned ray,                                    30     A sunbeam which hath lost its way,     And through the crevice and the cleft     Of the thick wall is fallen and left;     Creeping o'er the floor so damp,     Like a marsh's meteor lamp:[7]     And in each pillar there is a ring,[8]       And in each ring there is a chain;     That iron is a cankering thing,       For in these limbs its teeth remain,     With marks that will not wear away,                                40     Till I have done with this new day,     Which now is painful to these eyes,     Which have not seen the sun so rise     For years--I cannot count them o'er,     I lost their long and heavy score     When my last brother drooped and died,     And I lay living by his side.                          III.      They chained us each to a column stone,     And we were three--yet, each alone;     We could not move a single pace,                                   50     We could not see each other's face,     But with that pale and livid light     That made us strangers in our sight:     And thus together--yet apart,     Fettered in hand, but joined in heart,[d]     'Twas still some solace in the dearth     Of the pure elements of earth,     To hearken to each other's speech,     And each turn comforter to each     With some new hope, or legend old,                                 60     Or song heroically bold;     But even these at length grew cold.     Our voices took a dreary tone,     An echo of the dungeon stone,         A grating sound, not full and free,         As they of yore were wont to be:         It might be fancy--but to me     They never sounded like our own.                          IV.      I was the eldest of the three,       And to uphold and cheer the rest                                 70       I ought to do--and did my best--     And each did well in his degree.       The youngest, whom my father loved,     Because our mother's brow was given     To him, with eyes as blue as heaven--       For him my soul was sorely moved:     And truly might it be distressed     To see such bird in such a nest;[9]     For he was beautiful as day--       (When day was beautiful to me                                    80       As to young eagles, being free)--       A polar day, which will not see[10]     A sunset till its summer's gone,       Its sleepless summer of long light,     The snow-clad offspring of the sun:       And thus he was as pure and bright,     And in his natural spirit gay,     With tears for nought but others' ills,     And then they flowed like mountain rills,     Unless he could assuage the woe                                    90     Which he abhorred to view below.                          V.      The other was as pure of mind,     But formed to combat with his kind;     Strong in his frame, and of a mood     Which 'gainst the world in war had stood,     And perished in the foremost rank       With joy:--but not in chains to pine:     His spirit withered with their clank,       I saw it silently decline--       And so perchance in sooth did mine:                             100     But yet I forced it on to cheer     Those relics of a home so dear.     He was a hunter of the hills,       Had followed there the deer and wolf;       To him this dungeon was a gulf,     And fettered feet the worst of ills.                          VI.        Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls:     A thousand feet in depth below     Its massy waters meet and flow;     Thus much the fathom-line was sent                                 110     From Chillon's snow-white battlement,[11]       Which round about the wave inthralls:     A double dungeon wall and wave     Have made--and like a living grave.     Below the surface of the lake[12]     The dark vault lies wherein we lay:     We heard it ripple night and day;       Sounding o'er our heads it knocked;     And I have felt the winter's spray     Wash through the bars when winds were high                         120     And wanton in the happy sky;       And then the very rock hath rocked,       And I have felt it shake, unshocked,[13]     Because I could have smiled to see     The death that would have set me free.                          VII.      I said my nearer brother pined,     I said his mighty heart declined,     He loathed and put away his food;     It was not that 'twas coarse and rude,     For we were used to hunter's fare,                                 130     And for the like had little care:     The milk drawn from the mountain goat     Was changed for water from the moat,     Our bread was such as captives' tears     Have moistened many a thousand years,     Since man first pent his fellow men     Like brutes within an iron den;     But what were these to us or him?     These wasted not his heart or limb;     My brother's soul was of that mould                                140     Which in a palace had grown cold,     Had his free breathing been denied     The range of the steep mountain's side;[14]     But why delay the truth?--he died.[e]     I saw, and could not hold his head,     Nor reach his dying hand--nor dead,--     Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,     To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.[f]     He died--and they unlocked his chain,     And scooped for him a shallow grave[15]                            150     Even from the cold earth of our cave.     I begged them, as a boon, to lay     His corse in dust whereon the day     Might shine--it was a foolish thought,     But then within my brain it wrought,[16]     That even in death his freeborn breast     In such a dungeon could not rest.     I might have spared my idle prayer--     They coldly laughed--and laid him there:     The flat and turfless earth above                                  160     The being we so much did love;     His empty chain above it leant,     Such Murder's fitting monument!                          VIII.      But he, the favourite and the flower,     Most cherished since his natal hour,     His mother's image in fair face,     The infant love of all his race,     His martyred father's dearest thought,[17]     My latest care, for whom I sought     To hoard my life, that his might be                                170     Less wretched now, and one day free;     He, too, who yet had held untired     A spirit natural or inspired--     He, too, was struck, and day by day     Was withered on the stalk away.[18]     Oh, God! it is a fearful thing     To see the human soul take wing     In any shape, in any mood:[19]     I've seen it rushing forth in blood,     I've seen it on the breaking ocean                                 180     Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,     I've seen the sick and ghastly bed     Of Sin delirious with its dread:     But these were horrors--this was woe     Unmixed with such--but sure and slow:     He faded, and so calm and meek,     So softly worn, so sweetly weak,     So tearless, yet so tender--kind,     And grieved for those he left behind;     With all the while a cheek whose bloom                             190     Was as a mockery of the tomb,     Whose tints as gently sunk away     As a departing rainbow's ray;     An eye of most transparent light,     That almost made the dungeon bright;     And not a word of murmur--not     A groan o'er his untimely lot,--     A little talk of better days,     A little hope my own to raise,     For I was sunk in silence--lost                                    200     In this last loss, of all the most;     And then the sighs he would suppress     Of fainting Nature's feebleness,     More slowly drawn, grew less and less:     I listened, but I could not hear;     I called, for I was wild with fear;     I knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread     Would not be thus admonished;     I called, and thought I heard a sound--     I burst my chain with one strong bound,                            210     And rushed to him:--I found him not,     _I_ only stirred in this black spot,     _I_ only lived, _I_ only drew     The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;     The last, the sole, the dearest link     Between me and the eternal brink,     Which bound me to my failing race,     Was broken in this fatal place.     One on the earth, and one beneath--     My brothers--both had ceased to breathe:                           220     I took that hand which lay so still,     Alas! my own was full as chill;     I had not strength to stir, or strive,     But felt that I was still alive--     A"]]]
