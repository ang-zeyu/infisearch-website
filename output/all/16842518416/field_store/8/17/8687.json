Irene's wrist-watch was not a reliable timepiece, having bad habits of galloping and then suddenly losing, so to-night she did not trust to it, but sat in the hall with her eyes on the big white-faced clock. At exactly nine and a half minutes past eight she ran upstairs and tapped at the door of dormitory 13. There were sounds of scuffling inside and an agitated voice squealed:  \"Wait a minute.\"  But after a few moments quiet reigned and somebody else called:  \"Come in!\"  Feeling rather as if she were awaiting initiation into some Nihilist association Irene entered the room. As she did so a bandage was clapped over her eyes and she was led forward blindfolded. It was only after an impressive pause that the handkerchief was removed.  It was well she had been warned beforehand, or the sight which met her gaze might have caused her to emit a yell loud enough to attract the attention of a passing prefect. The Villa Camellia was admirably supplied with electric light, but on this historic occasion the apartment was illuminated solely by a couple of candle-ends stuck in a pair of vases. Their flickering flame revealed a solemn row of nine dressing-gowned figures, each of which wore a black paper mask with holes for her eyes. The general effect was most startling and horrible, and resembled a meeting of the Inquisition, or some other society bent on torture and dark doings. Repressing her first gasp, however, Irene bore the vision with remarkable equanimity, and advancing towards the dread figures waited obediently until she was addressed. Evidently she had done the right thing, for the spokeswoman, clearing her throat, began in impressive accents:  \"Sister Irene Beverley, you are admitted here to-night to be made a member of our Sorority. Are you willing to join and to take the pledges?\"  \"Yes, thanks, but please what's a sorority?\" ventured Irene meekly.  Two or three distinct snickers were heard from underneath the black masks, but a voice murmured, \"Order!\" and the sounds promptly ceased.  \"A sorority is a secret sisterhood,\" explained the President, \"just the same as a fraternity is a brotherhood. We call ourselves 'The Camellia Buds,' and we're members of the Transition who have banded ourselves together for the purposes of mutual protection. It's a great honor to be elected. There are only nine of us so far, and we've waited ever so long to choose a tenth. I hope you appreciate the privilege?\"  \"I do indeed!\"  \"You're ready to take the vow? Then the initiation may proceed. Sword-bearers, guard the door, please.\"  There was a Masonic quality about the proceedings. Two dark figures, armed with rulers, placed themselves at the threshold, prepared to settle all intruders, and to preserve the absolute secrecy of the ceremony.  \"Will you give your word of honor to be a loyal member of the Sorority of Camellia Buds, and never to do a dirty trick so long as you remain at this school?\" asked the President.  \"I promise!\" replied Irene.  At that somebody switched on the electric light, and the members, pulling off their black masks, disclosed their laughing faces.  \"You stood it A-1. I was quite prepared for you to start hysterics and had the sal volatile bottle ready right here,\" chirruped Delia gayly.  \"We call it our 'strength of mind' test,\" explained President Agnes, blowing out the guttering candles.  \"If I _had_ screamed what would have happened?\" inquired Irene.  \"Probation for another week till you got your nerves. We'd a business with Sheila just at first; she's rather fluttersome. Well, anyway, you've got through the ordeal, and now you're a full-fledged 'bud.' Aren't you proud?\"  \"Rather! Is the society limited to ten?\"  \"Sorority, please, not society. It's limited because there isn't anybody else in the Transition who's worth asking to join. Most of them are a set of utter sneaks. They may take Rachel's oath about preserving their nationality and all the rest of it, but if they're to be counted specimens of Anglo-American honor it makes one blush for one's mother country whichever side of the ocean it happens to be on. Oh, you don't know most of them yet! Wait till you find them out.\"  \"You'll be glad then you belong to us.\"  \"Not that we're perfect, of course.\"  \"We don't set up as Pharisees.\"  \"On the whole we're rather a lot of lunatics.\"  \"We just have a little sport among ourselves to keep things humming.\"  \"Well, now Irene understands, we'd best get her fixed up with a 'buddy' and close the meeting.\"  \"But I _don't_ understand. What, for goodness' sake, is a buddy, and why must I have one?\" demanded Irene tragically.  \"Sit down there, child, and let Grannie talk to you,\" replied President Agnes. \"If you haven't heard of a buddy yet it's time you did. They're the latest out. They had them at all the camps last summer, in England as well as in America. A buddy is a chum with whom you're pledged to do everything, and who's bound to support you. For instance, when the bathing season is on you must never swim unless your buddy is swimming with you; if you go on an excursion you stick to each other tight as glue, and if one of you is lost the other is held responsible. You're as inseparable as a box and its lid, or the two blades of a pair of scissors, or a bottle and its cork, or any other things you happen to think of that ought to go together, and aren't any use apart.\"  \"We only realized buddies last term,\" explained Peachy, \"but the idea caught on no end. We all went simply crazy over it. I don't mind guessing that every girl in this school who's worth her salt has got her buddy. She mayn't let it be known outside her own sorority, but we aren't blind.\"  \"Are there other sororities in the school then besides the Camellia Buds?\" asked Irene.  \"Bless your innocence! I should think there are. There's a rival one in the Transition. I rather fancy they've snapped up Mabel already. I gave Winnie a hint she wasn't to tackle _you_, because you'd come to school with an introduction to _me_, so I ought to have first innings. The prefects have a sorority all to themselves, and the seniors have one, and as for the juniors, silly little things, they're as transparent as glass, with their signaling and their grips and their cypher letters. Any one can see through them with half an eye. But we're wasting time. We've got to fix you up with a buddy, and we must be quick before the bell rings.\"  \"May we choose?\" asked Irene, and her eyes fell longingly on Peachy.  \"No, we mayn't!\" said President Agnes firmly. \"We have to take what the fates send us. It's Kismet. Every time we elect a new member we draw lots again for buddies. It's a kind of general shuffle. If we're an uneven number somebody of course has to be odd man out.\"  \"I was the 'old maid' last draw, and I haven't had a buddy this term,\" remarked Sheila plaintively.  \"Never mind, ducky! You're bound to find a partner now,\" consoled Delia. \"It might even be my little self, so live in hope.\"  \"No such luck,\" groaned Sheila. \"I'll probably get Joan, and you know she always uses me as a door-mat.\"  Agnes meantime was writing ten names on ten separate pieces of paper and folding them in identically the same fashion. Peachy offered the loan of a hat, and into this treasury they were cast and shuffled.  \"The newest member draws,\" murmured Agnes, and the others pushed Irene forward. She chose two folds of paper at a venture, and twisted them together, then performed the like service for another pair, until all the ten were assorted. The thrill of the ceremony was when Agnes opened the screws of paper and read out the names. Fate had mixed the Camellia Buds together thus:            Peachy Proctor--Sheila Yonge.           Jess Cameron--Delia Watts.           Joan Lucas--Esther Cartmel.           Agnes Dalton--Mary Fergusson.           Lorna Carson--Irene Beverley.  Whether the members of the secret sorority felt satisfied or otherwise with the result of the shuffle, etiquette forbade them to show anything but polite enthusiasm. Each took her buddy solemnly by the hand and vowed allegiance. Peachy then produced what she called \"the loving cup,\" a three-handled vase of brown pottery brought by Jess from Edinburgh and with the motto \"Mak' yersel' at hame,\" on it in cream-colored letters. It was usually a receptacle for flowers, but it had been hastily washed for the occasion and filled with lemonade, a rather bitter brew concocted by Peachy and Delia from a half-ripe lemon plucked in the garden and a few lumps of sugar saved from tea. This was passed round, and the Camellia Buds gulped it heroically as a pledge of sisterhood.  \"The password is _Thistle-down_,\" decreed Agnes, as the members, trying not to pull sour faces, consoled themselves with candy and broke up the meeting. \"Any one who can think of a stunt for next time please bring along propositions. We're always open to new ideas and ready for a startler.\"  As a direct result of her admission to this select sorority Irene found herself flung by Fate into the arms of Lorna Carson. Had any individual choice been allowed she would have selected Peachy, Jess, Delia, or even Sheila in preference, but the lot once cast she must abide by it and be content. She had a very shrewd suspicion that when the buddies got tired of each other they elected a fresh member and so necessitated a general reshuffle of partners, and that her admission to the society had been welcomed as the pretext for such a change. Here she was, however, pledged to intimate friendship with Lorna, a girl who half fascinated and half repelled her, and who, though she might possibly turn out trumps in the future, was for the present at least most difficult to understand.     CHAPTER V  Fairy Godmothers, Limited  Irene Beverley, when she first left the shores of her native land, was a particularly light-hearted, jolly little Britisher, not at all bookish, and not accustomed to worry her head over"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20163"],["title","The Jolliest School of All (#7)"],["body"," of the deep affairs of life, but ready to have a royal time with anybody of similar tastes and inclinations. In her first letter home she summed up the results of a week's experience.                                         \"THE VILLA CAMELLIA.           \"MUMMIE DARLING,           \"This is to tell you I am still alive! I'm a little          surprised, because I thought math would kill me.          Miss Bickford is most _horribly_ conscientious and          insists upon finding out whether I really          understand or not, and it is generally 'not.' I          suppose I was born with a thick head for figures,          anyway, she seems amazed at my ignorance. I lay the          blame on St. Osmund's. Is that mean of me? It's my          only way of paying out Miss Gordon for past scores.           \"I don't mind admitting I have warm times in          school over some of the classes, but the rest of          the life is lovely. Miss Bickford is often a big          thorn, but Peachy is a rose. As for Lorna she's          like one of those tropical flowers that Uncle          Redvers grows in his conservatory. How does Vin          like being at the office? Are you straight yet at          the flat? Come and see me as soon as ever you can,          because I'm a little bit lonesome and wanting my          home folks, though I wouldn't confess it to any of          these girls for the world.           \"Heaps of love to Dad and Vin and your dear self.                                              \"From                                                  \"RENIE.\"  If Irene, who had found her niche in a congenial set at the Villa Camellia, was capable of feeling the pangs of homesickness, that unpleasant malady exhibited itself with far more serious symptoms in the case of another new girl who had entered the school upon the same day. Désirée Legrand could not settle down among the juniors. She was used to the society of grown-up people, and did not take kindly to young companions. In the excitement of her own affairs Irene had hardly given the child a thought since her arrival, but one afternoon, when enjoying a solitary ramble round the garden, she suddenly came face to face with Little Flaxen. She was shocked at the change in her; the once pink cheeks were white and pasty, and her eyelids were red and swollen as if with perpetual crying.  \"Hello! Whatever have you been doing to yourself?\" exclaimed Irene. \"You look rather a bunch of misery, don't you? What's the matter?\"  Désirée, squatting forlornly on the steps that led to the upper tennis courts, produced a lace-bordered pocket-handkerchief and mopped her eyes.  \"Nobody loves me here!\" she blurted out dramatically. \"I'm just wr-r-r-etched! They all laugh and call me Frenchie! I'm not French, and I w-w-ant to be l-l-oved!\"  Irene looked at her and shook her head.  \"That's not the way to go about it I'm afraid. I'm sorry, but you know you'll just _invite_ teasing if you carry on like this. Can't you brace up and be sporty? Pretend you don't mind anything they say and they'll soon stop.\"  \"But I _do_ mind!\" sobbed the tragic little figure on the steps. \"I mind d-d-dreadfully! Why are they all so horrid to me? People have always been so nice till I came here!\"  \"That's exactly the reason,\" said Irene, grasping the situation and explaining it truthfully. \"You've been accustomed to be petted by everybody, and after all why _should_ the other girls in your form pet you? You don't pet _them_, do you?\"  \"N-n-o!\"  Désirée's eyes were round with amazement.  \"Well, can't you see school's a matter of give and take? If you do something for the rest they'll possibly like you, but they won't fall on your neck just out of sheer good nature. Why don't you write home for a box of chocolates and offer them round your form?\"  \"I never thought of it. I had some chocolates--but--I ate them!\"  \"There you are! You expected to get all the attention and give nothing. Sorry if I seem brutal, but it's the solid truth. You take my advice and cheer up instead of continually sniveling. I've been at school myself since I was seven, and I know a thing or two. If a girl's popular there's generally some reason behind it. Look here, I'll help you if I can. Those kids over there are doing nothing. I'll get them to come and play rounders, choose you for a partner, and I'll back our side to win. Here's Peachy! Perhaps she'll join in too. I'll ask her.\"  Irene rapidly explained her philanthropic intentions, and enlisted both Peachy and Delia in her team. The juniors, amazed and flattered at an invitation from older girls, were ready enough for a game. Irene insisted upon the innovation of what she called \"hunting in couples,\" that is to say, dividing the company into partners who made the course hand in hand. She took good care to choose Désirée for her \"running-mate,\" and as they were both fleet of foot they scored considerably. By the time the bell rang they had beaten the records.  \"Look here!\" said Irene, addressing the juniors before they scooted away, \"you kids are missing a chance. Why don't you make Désirée train for the sports? She can run like a hare! With the start she'd get as a junior she might win you a trophy. Hadn't it ever entered your silly young noddles to see what she could do for your form? Well, you are a set of slackers! That's my opinion of you. We manage our affairs better in the Transition.\"  \"Oh, thank you! Thank you!\" gasped Little Flaxen, lingering a moment or two behind the others. \"You've been just great! I'll write to Dad to-night to send me some chocs, and I won't eat a single one myself. They shall have them all. They shall really!\"  With scarlet cheeks and shining eyes she was a different child from the weeping Niobe who had sat and sobbed on the steps.  \"Now if I'd simply coddled her and sympathized she'd have cried a few gallons more and have been no better off,\" mused Irene, as her protégée danced away. \"I fancy those juniors have been fairly nasty to her, though I wouldn't tell her so. Something ought to be done about it, but the question is 'what?' I want to have a talk with Peachy when I can wedge in ten minutes of spare time.\"  All evening remembrance of Little Flaxen's red eyes and white cheeks haunted Irene. She felt it ought not to have been possible for the child to be so lonely and neglected. Granted that her unpopularity might be partly her own fault, boycotting was nevertheless hard to bear. It was clearly somebody's business to have looked after her, and that duty ought not to have devolved upon a newcomer like herself, who only realized the necessity by the merest chance.  \"What's the use of the prefects?\" Irene asked herself, but she gave up the answer, and appealed to Peachy at breakfast-time instead.  That cheery young American took the matter more seriously than Irene expected. There was a very kind little heart hidden under her bubbles of fun.  \"I'll call a meeting of the Camellia Buds right now,\" she declared. \"I guess we don't want any of those poor babes crying their eyes out. Talk of homesickness! You should have seen me my first week here. I brought four dozen pocket-handkerchiefs to school with me and I used them all. It's not good enough! Prefects, did you say? Humph! I don't call Rachel exactly laid out for this job. Bring your biscuits to the 'Grotto' at interval, and we'll have a powwow about it.\"  There was a twenty-minute mid-morning break between classes, during which the girls ate lunch and amused themselves as they pleased in the house or grounds. The biscuits, three apiece, were laid out in rows on the dining-room table together with each pupil's glass of milk. As Irene ran in to take her portion she heard a scrimmage going on at the other end of the room. Several small girls were quarreling loudly, and above the noise came Désirée's piping, high-pitched voice:  \"I haven't had a biscuit for days and it isn't fair.\"  \"What's all this about?\" asked Irene, striding into the crowd just in time to see Mabel and another member of the Transition pass, laughing, through the lower door.  There was a babel in reply.  \"Those big girls come and grab our biscuits!\"  \"It's a shame of them!\"  \"There ought to be three apiece!\"  \"And there never are!\"  \"It's something if you get two!\"  \"Nancy's taken both mine!\"  \"Honest injun, I haven't!\"  \"I tell you I'm famished!\"  \"Help! Don't all shout at once,\" decreed Irene. \"Let's have a biscuit parade. Each hold out what she's got. Here, Audley, hand one of yours over to Francie. Effie, break that one in half and share with Chris. Désirée, you may have mine this morning, but this business mustn't happen again. I've no time to stop now, but I'll inquire into this, you bet!\"  Leaving an only partially satisfied group of small girls behind her Irene sped to her tryst in the garden. She took a short cut, and ran through the orange grove, where the half-ripe oranges were beginning to turn yellow on the trees, then shamelessly jumping over a flower border of stocks and primulas, crossed under the rose-pergola, turned down a creeper-covered side alley, and found herself in a neglected portion of the grounds. Here there was a very dilapidated little arbor, built sixty or seventy years ago when the Villa Camellia had been owned by an Italian count with a weakness for the fine arts. The roof leaked, and a riot of jessamine almost hid the door; the window-sill had fallen, and the floor was a mass of dead leaves. The plastered walls were painted with frescoes--faded and moldy now--of a country château with cypress trees, and three ladies in big plumed hats riding on white horses, and a gentleman in shooting costume and tall boots, who wore side whiskers, and carried a gun, and had four hunting dogs standing in a row behind him. All these were rather stiff and badly painted, yet gave an air of neglected grandeur to the grotto. There were marble seats, and a rickety marble table, and a little broken statue of Cupid"]]]
