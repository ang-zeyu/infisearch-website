The ground was better for a space and he ran desperately. Every breath he drew pained him, now and again he staggered slightly, but he kept his feet and plunged frantically on.  Then one of the lights in the house went out. Then another. There was only one now. \"That's--that's--what--it means for--for--people to--to go to--to bed early,\" he panted with difficulty. \"I--I always--said----\" He had not the breath to finish, but it is undoubtedly true that he had always been a staunch advocate of remaining up all night.  He fixed his eyes upon the one remaining light and ran with utter desperation. His breathing was spasmodic, he reeled, pulled himself together by sheer will, and stumbled on. On the next stone wall he made a momentary concession to his exhaustion and paused just a moment, holding his aching side.  Then he was off again, running like mad. The single little light seemed twinkling and hazy and he brushed his streaming face with his sleeve so that he might see it the more clearly. But it looked dull, more like a little patch of brightness than a shining light. Either it was failing, or he was.  He had to hold his stinging side and gulp for every breath he drew, but he ran with all his might and main. He was too spent and dizzy to keep his direction without that distant light, and he knew it. He was not Tom Slade to be sure of himself in complete darkness. He was giddy--on the verge of collapse. The bee-line of his course loosened and became erratic. But if his legs were weakening his will was strong, and he staggered, reeled, ran.  On, on, on, he sped, falling forward now, rather than running, but keeping his feet by the sheer power of his will. His heart seemed up in his mouth and choking him. With one hand he grasped the flying shred of his torn trousers and tried to wipe the blood from the cut in his leg. Thus for just a second his progress was impeded.  That was the last straw. The trifling movement lost him his balance, his exhausted and convulsed body went round like a top and he lay breathing in little jerks on the swampy ground.  One second. Two seconds. Three seconds. In another five seconds he would rise. He raised himself on one trembling arm and looked about. He brushed his soaking hair back from his eyes and looked again.  \"Where--what--where--is--it--anyway?\" he panted. He did not know which direction was north or south or east or west. He only knew that a dagger was sticking in his side and that he could not rise....  Yes, he could. He pulled himself together, rested a moment on his knees, staggered to his feet and looked around.  \"Where--where--th--the dickens--is north?\"  He turned and looked around. He looked around the other way. Nothing but desolation and darkness. He thought of what Tom had told him and, closing his eyes, opened them suddenly. The mountain must have been too near to show in outline now; it had probably melted into the general landscape. There was just an even, solid blackness all about him. The wind moaned, and somewhere, high and far off, he heard the screech of an eagle. But at least the rain did not assail him as it had done. This, however, was small comfort. He had lost, _failed_, and he knew it.  In pitiable despair, in the anguish of defeat, he looked about him again in every direction, as if to beseech the angry night to give him back his one little beacon, and let him only save those people if he died for it.  But there was no light anywhere. It had gone out.     CHAPTER VIII  ALMOST   Well, he would not go back. They should find him right there, his body marking the very last foot he had been able to go. He would die as those brother scouts of his would have to die. He would not go back.  That good rule of the scouts to stop and think was not in Hervey's line. But he would do the next best thing--a thing very characteristic of Hervey Willetts. He would take a chance and start running. Yes, that would be better. There would be just one chance in four of his going in the right direction. But he had taken bigger chances than that before. Anyway, the rain was ceasing. And he soon overcame the sentimental notion of just lying there.  The momentary rest had restored some measure of his strength. The aching in his side was not so acute. The land was not so muddy where he was and he took off his jacket and washed some of the heavy mud from his shoes.  Then he started off pell-mell. Who shall say what good angel prompted him to look behind? Perhaps it was the little god Billikins of whom you are to know more in these pages. But look behind Hervey Willetts did. And there in the distance, very tiny but very clear, was a spark bobbing in the darkness.  He paused and watched it over his shoulder. It moved along slowly, very slowly. It disappeared. Then appeared again. And now it moved a little faster. A little faster still. Now it moved along at an even, steady rate. The long, hard pull up Cheery Hill was over, and the horses were jogging along the road. Oh, how well Hervey knew that lantern which hung under the rear step of the clumsy, lumbering old bus.  _Then it had not passed._  Hervey Willetts was himself now. Tearing a loose shred from his tattered trousers, he soaked it in a little puddle, then stuffed it in his mouth. He clasped his jack-knife in one fist and a twig in the other. He drew up his belt. He took that precious hat off and stuffed it in his pocket, campaign buttons and all. Ah, no, he did not throw it away. He ripped off another rag and tied it fast around his neck and he bound his scarf around his forehead. He knew all these little tricks of the runner. It was not thought, but _action_ now.  But, oh, Hervey, Hervey! What sort of a scout are you? Did you not know that the shriek of the eagle must have been from the mountain in the north? Did you not know that eagles live on mountain crags? Why did you not face into the wind and you would have headed north? When the rain did not blow in your face or against either cheek, that was because you were facing _south_. It had not stopped raining. It was raining and blowing for _your_ sake and you did not know it. You were hunting for a kerosene lamp!  But there are scouts and scouts.  Bareheaded, half naked, he sped through the darkness like a ghostly specter of the night. He headed for a point some fifty yards ahead of the bus. He knew that coming from behind he could not catch it in time. He was running to _intercept_ it, not to _overtake_ it. He was running at right angles to it and for a point ahead of it. Therein lay his only chance, and not a very good chance. By all the rules there was _no_ chance. By the divine law which gives power to desperation, there was--a little.  He ran in utter abandonment, in frenzy. Some power outside of himself bore him on. What else? Like a fiend, with arms swinging and head swathed in a crazy rag, he moved through wind and storm, invincible, indomitable! His head throbbed, his mouth was thick, his side ached, but he seemed beyond the power of these things now. Over the fences he went, leaving shreds of clothing blowing in the gale, and tearing his flesh on stone walls. In the madness of despair, and in the insane resolve that despair begets, he sped on, on, on....  The bus was now almost even with his course. He changed his course to keep ahead of it. The lumbering old rattle-trap gave out a human note now, which cheered the runner. He could hear the voices within it. Very faint, but still he could hear them. He knew he could not make himself heard because the wind was the other way. Besides which, he had not the voice to call. His whole frame was trembling; he could not have spoken even.  On, on, on. The trees passed him like trees seen from a train window. He turned the wet rag in his mouth to draw a little more moisture from it. He clutched his sweating hands tighter around the knife and twig. He shook the blowing, dripping hair from his eyes. Forward, _forward!_ If he slackened his speed now he would fall--collapse. Like a top, his speed kept him up.  Running straight ahead he would about run into the bus, which meant that it was gaining on him. Again he bent his course to a point ahead of it. Each maneuver of this kind narrowed the angle between himself and the bus until soon he would be _pursuing_ it. The angle would be no more. He would be running _after_ the bus and losing ground.  By a supreme, final spurt, he had now a fair chance to make the road and intercept the bus before it reached the broad, level stretch to the bridge. Should it reach that point his last chance would have vanished.  In this desperate pass he tried to shout, but found, as the spent runner usually does, that he was almost voiceless. A feeble call was all he could manage, and on the contrary wind and noise of the storm, this was quite inadequate. He could only stumble on, borne up by his indomitable will. He was weakening and he knew it.  Yet the light of the bus so near him gave him fresh hope, and with it fresh strength. It seemed a kind of perversity of fate that he should have reached a point ordinarily within earshot, and yet could not make his approach known.  Just as the bus was passing his course, and when it was perhaps three or four hundred feet distant, Hervey, putting all his strength into a final spurt, sped forward in a blind frenzy like one possessed. He saw the bus go by; heard the voices within it. Throwing his jack-knife from him in a kind of frantic, maniacal desperation, he tried to scream, and finding that he could not, that his voice was dead while yet his limbs lived, and that his panting throat was clogged up and his nerves jangled and uncontrollable, he bounded forward in a kind of delirium of concentrated effort.  Then, suddenly, his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19590"],["title","Tom Slade's Double Dare (#5)"],["body"," sank into a hole. Perhaps with a little calmness and patience he could have released it. But in his wild hurry he tried to wrench it out. A sudden, sharp pain rewarded this insane effort. He lost his balance and went sprawling to the ground, another quick, excruciating twinge accompanying his fall, and lay there on the soggy ground like a woodchuck in a trap.  The old bus went lumbering by.     CHAPTER IX  THE HERO   The best account of this business was given by Darby Curren, the bus driver, or Curry, as the boys called him.  \"We was jes' comin' onter the good road, we was, and I was jes' about goin' ter give Lefty a taste o' the whip ter let 'er know ter wake up. Them kids inside was a hollerin', '_Hit 'er up!\" 'Step on 'er!' 'Give 'er the gas!_' and all sech nonsense. Well, by gorry, I never seed sech a night since Noah sailed away in the ark, I didn't. So ye'll understand I was'n' fer bein' surprised at nuthin' I see. Ghosts nor nuthin'.  \"Well, all of a sudden Lefty begins to jump and rear step sideways and was like to drag us all in the ditch when what do I see but that there thing, like a ghost or somethin' it was, hangin' onter her bridle. It was makin' some kind of a noise, I dunno what. First off I thought plum certain it was a ghost. Then I thought it was Hasbrooks' boy, that's what I thought, on account o' him havin' them fits and maybe bein' buried alive. It was me that druv the hearse fer 'im only a week back. And I says then to Corby that was sittin' with me, I says, no son o' mine that ever had them fits would be buried in three days, not if I knowed it. Safety first, I said, dead or livin'.  \"Well, I hollered to him what he wanted there and I didn't get no answer so I got down. And all the rest o' that howlin' pack got out, and the two men. I guess they thought we was held up, Jesse James like. Only the little codger stayed inside.  \"Well, there he was, all tore and bloody and not enough duds left to stop up a rat-hole. And we hed ter force his hand open, he was hangin' onter the bridle that hard.\"  Well, that was about all there was to it; the rest was told by many mouths. They forced open his grip on the horse's bridle and he collapsed and lay unconscious on the ground. They lifted him and carried him gently into the bus, and laid him on one of the long seats. His left foot was shoeless and lacerated.  There were a couple of first aid scouts in the party, and they did what they could for him, bathing his face and trying to restore some measure of repose to his jangled nerves. They washed his torn foot with antiseptic while one kept a cautious hold upon his fluttering pulse. They administered a heart stimulant out of their kit, and waited. He did not speak nor open his eyes, save momentarily at intervals, when he stared vacantly. But the stout heart which had served him in his superhuman effort, would not desert him now, and in a little while the brother scout who held his wrist laid it gently down and, in a kind of freakish impulse, made the full scout salute to the unconscious figure. That seemed odd, too, because at camp he was not thought to be a really A-1 scout....  The two scoutmasters of the arriving troops remained in the bus with the first aid scouts and a queer little codger who seemed to be lame; the others walked. Hervey Willetts had ridden on top of that bus (contrary to orders), but he had never before lain quietly on the seat of it and been watched by two scoutmasters. He was always being watched by scoutmasters, but never in just this way....  So the old bus lumbered on. Soon he opened his eyes and mumbled something.  \"Yes, my boy,\" said one of the scoutmasters; \"what is it?\"  \"S--sma--smashed--br--,\" he said incoherently.  \"Yes, we'll have a doctor as soon as we reach camp,\" the scoutmaster said soothingly. \"Try to bear it. Don't move it and perhaps it won't pain so.\"  Hervey shook his head petulantly as if it were not his foot he spoke of. \"Br--oken--the--br--look out----\" And again he seemed to faint away.  The scoutmaster was puzzled.  In a few moments he spoke again, his eyes closed. But the word he spoke was clear.  \"Ahead,\" he whispered.  The scoutmaster was still puzzled but he opened the bus door and called, \"Gilbert, suppose you and a couple of the boys go on ahead and watch your step.\" Then to the other scoutmaster he said, \"I think he's a bit delirious.\"  So it happened that it was Gilbert Tyson of the troop from Hillsburgh, forty or fifty miles down the line, who shouted to Darby Curren to stop, that the bridge had been washed away.  A funny part of the whole business was that the little duffer in the bus, who was attached to that troop, thought that Tyson was the hero of the occasion. He was strong on troop loyalty if on nothing else. So far as he was concerned (and he was very much concerned) Tyson had saved the lives of every scout in those two troops. Subsequent circumstances favored this delusion of his. For one thing, Hervey Willetts cared nothing at all about glory. You could not fit the mantle of heroism on him to save your life. He never talked about the affair, he was seldom at camp, except to sleep, and he did not know how he had managed the last few yards of his triumphal errand. For another thing, the Hillsburgh troop kept to themselves more or less, occupying one of the isolated \"hill cabins.\" As for Tom Slade, he seldom talked much. He had seen too many stunts to lose his head over a new one, and he was a poor sort of publicity agent for Hervey.  Thus Goliath, as the little codger came to be known, had the field all to himself, and he turned out to be a mighty \"hero maker.\"     CHAPTER X  PROVEN A SCOUT   The bus came to a stop a hundred feet or so from the ruined bridge and its passengers, going forward cautiously, looked down shudderingly into the yawning chasm. For a few seconds the very thought of what might have happened filled them with silent awe.  Goliath was the first to speak. \"It's good Tyson saved our lives, isn't it?\" he piped up. \"We'd all be dead, 'wouldn't we?\"  \"Very dead,\" said one of the scouts; \"so dead we probably wouldn't know it.\"  \"Wouldn't _know_ it?\" asked Goliath, puzzled.  For answer the scout gave him a bantering push and tousled his hair for him. The little fellow took refuge with one of the scoutmasters.  \"Will we get to that camp soon?\" he asked.  \"Pretty soon, I hope. Perhaps some one will come down and show us the way.\"  \"Are we lost?\"  \"No, we're saved.\"  \"I'm glad we're in Tyson's troop, aren't you?\"  The scoutmaster laughed. \"You bet,\" he said.  \"Are there wild animals in that camp?\"  \"Scouts are all wild animals,\" the scoutmaster laughed again.  \"Am I a wild animal?\"  \"Surest thing you know.\"  \"Are you?\"  \"That's what.\"  \"Is that fellow that's inside lying on the seat--is he dead?\"  \"No--not dead. But you mustn't go in and bother him.\"  The scene about the bridge was one of utter ruin. No vestige of the rustic structure was left; it had probably been carried away in the first overwhelming rush of water. The flood had subsided by now, and only a trickle of water passed through the gully. In this, and upon the sloping banks and the wreckage which had been Ebon Berry's garage, the scouts climbed about and explored the scene of devastation.  After a while a scoutmaster and several boys arrived from camp by way of the road. They had fought their way through mud and storm, bringing stretchers and a first aid kit, in expectation of finding disaster.  \"This is not a very cheerful welcome to camp,\" one of the scoutmasters said. \"The lake broke through up yonder. The boys have checked the flood with a kind of makeshift dam. We were afraid you had met with disaster. All safe and sound, are you?\"  \"Oh, yes, several of our boys went ahead and one of them shouted for us to stop----\"  \"That's the one right there,\" piped up the little fellow. \"Maybe he'll get a reward, hey? Maybe he'll get a prize.\"  \"I guess we're all safe and sound,\" said the other arriving scoutmaster; \"but wet and hungry----\"  \"Especially hungry,\" one of the scouts said.  \"That's a common failing here,\" said the man from camp.  \"There's a funny fellow inside; want to see him?\" piped up Goliath. \"He hasn't got any clothes hardly, and he don't know what he's talking about; he hasn't got any conscience----\"  \"He means he's unconscious,\" said the scoutmaster. \"We ran into him on the road. He really hasn't spoken yet, so we don't know anything about him. He seems a kind of victim of the storm--crazed. I think it just possible he intended--Come inside, won't you? I think we'll have to take him with us on a stretcher. I suppose he belongs in the countryside hereabouts.\"  Thus it was that Hervey's own scoutmaster looked down upon the unconscious form of his most troublesome and unruly scout. It was no wonder that the others had not thought him a scout. He looked more like a juvenile hobo. But sticking out of his soaking pocket was that one indubitable sign of identification, his rimless hat cut full of holes and decorated with its variety of badge buttons. Ruefully, Mr. Denny lifted this dripping masterpiece of original handiwork, and held it between his thumb and forefinger.  \"This is one of our choicest youngsters,\" he said. \"He is in my own troop. The last time I saw him, I explicitly told him not to leave camp without my permission. I suppose he has been on some escapade or other. I think he's about due for dismissal----\"  \"I don't think he's seriously injured, sir.\"  \"Oh, no, he has a charmed life. Nine lives like a cat, in fact. Well, we'll cart him back.\"  \"He doesn't look like a scout fellow,\" Goliath said.  \"Well, he isn't what you would call a very good scout fellow, my boy,\" Mr. Denny said. \"Good scout fellows usually know the law and obey it, if anybody should ask you.\"  \"If they ask me, that's what I'll tell 'em,\" said Goliath, \"hey?\"  \"You can't go far wrong if you tell them that,\" Mr. Denny said.  \"And they have to save lives too, don't they?\""]]]
