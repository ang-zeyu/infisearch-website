Now, perhaps, you will induce my wife to take some rest. How lucky that you were able to find a nurse in a little place like Whittington!\"  \"I am very fortunate indeed,\" replied the doctor in his hearty voice. \"Nurse Fraser has been trained at St. Joseph's, and happens to be staying at Whittington for a brief holiday. She has most kindly consented to undertake the case until we can get fresh assistance from London.\"  \"I will stay as long as I am wanted,\" said Dorothy in her quiet voice. \"If I can be shown to a room for a moment to take off my bonnet and cloak, I will go immediately afterward to the little patient.\"  Dorothy's voice was perfectly cool and calm. She did not speak in the constrained whisper which the poor Squire thought it right to use. There was an everyday tone in her voice which at this moment was absolutely refreshing, and the sympathy in her blue eyes just gave the right quality to the cool tones.  The doctor looked at her with unconcealed admiration. \"That girl is one in ten thousand,\" he said to himself. \"She will keep us all on our mettle, I can see, but there is plenty of heart underneath that cool exterior.\"  The great luxurious house looked neglected and wretched. Although the father and mother were up, and one or two servants were assisting in the sickroom, the greater number of the servants were still in bed. There was no one to take Miss Fraser to a room, and the Squire looked round him in hopeless bewilderment.  Dorothy saw at a glance that she must take matters into her own hands.  \"I do not want to trouble you,\" she said. \"I can put my cloak and bonnet in here. I should like to put on my cap and apron before I go upstairs.\"  She opened a door as she spoke, and went into a room where all the blinds were down, took off her outdoor things, and, taking a cap out of her bag, slipped it over her hair, tied on a white apron, and then stood ready and capable, and fresh and bright, before the Squire and the doctor.  \"Now, come straight upstairs with me,\" said the doctor.  They went up together; Squire Harvey followed them at a distance. When the doctor reached the first landing, he opened a green baize door, shut it behind him, and walked down a long, cool corridor which led in the direction of the nurseries.  \"Now, look here,\" he said, turning and facing Dorothy, \"the great thing that we have both to do is to keep this terrible disease from spreading. One or two of the servants have been with the case from the first; the father and mother have been in and out of the room as freely and unconstrainedly as if the child had only a cold the matter with her; if they are likely to take the infection, the mischief is probably done already; but, on the chance of this not being so, I shall beg of the Squire to come into this part of the house as seldom as possible. And as to Mrs. Harvey, she must be got away; that is your task, nurse. You will allow me to call you nurse, won't you?\"  \"Certainly. Call me Nurse Dorothy; I like that name best. I am called that by the children at St. Joseph's.\"  \"Very well. I am sure you will be a blessing here; but a great deal of tact must be used. The position of affairs is extremely difficult.\"  \"I will do my best,\" replied the nurse. The doctor gave her another look of complete satisfaction, and they entered the room where the little patient lay between life and death.  A small cot had been drawn almost into the center of the room, the blinds were down, there was a sense of desolation, and a heavy smell in the air.  \"Who has shut these windows?\" said the doctor in a voice of disapproval.  He went straight across the room, drew up one of the blinds, and opened the window two or three inches. A fresh current of air immediately improved the close atmosphere.  When he spoke, and when he and Nurse Fraser came into the room, a fair-haired young woman, who was on her knees by the side of the cot, started up suddenly, and gazed at them out of a pair of wide blue eyes. Her cheeks were deeply flushed, her lips were parched and dry.  \"Oh, doctor,\" she said, staggering toward Dr. Staunton, \"you have come back. What a blessing! She is asleep now; perhaps she is better.\"  The doctor went over and looked at the child. She was a little creature of not more than five years of age. In health she may have been pretty, she probably was; but now, the shadowy little face, the emaciated hands, the hot, dry, cracked lips, were the reverse of beautiful. They were all that was pathetic, however; and Dorothy's heart went straight out to the baby who lay there in such suffering and weakness.  The doctor looked at her, and gave a significant glance toward Mrs. Harvey.  Dorothy took her cue at once.  \"I have come to nurse your dear little girl, madam,\" she said. \"Dr. Staunton has brought me. I have a great deal of experience, as I am superintendent of one of the children's wards at St. Joseph's Hospital. I think you may trust your little girl to me; but first of all, let me take you to your room and put you to bed.\"  \"Put me to bed!\" said Mrs. Harvey, with a laugh which jarred on everyone's nerves. \"I have not been in bed for nights. I could not sleep. When the doctor tells me that Freda is out of danger, then I may be able to sleep, but not before--not before.\"  \"Whether you sleep or not,\" continued Dorothy, \"you must come and lie down. You are completely worn out, and can do no good whatever to the child in your present condition. While she sleeps it is surely right that you should sleep too. Come, I will promise to call you if you are wanted.\"  \"Yes, dear madam, let me entreat of you to go to bed,\" said the doctor.  The door was opened at this moment, and the Squire came in.  \"Now Elfreda,\" he said, coming up to his wife, \"you will go and take some rest, won't you?\"  She looked from him to the nurse, and from the nurse to the doctor, and then her tired, bright eyes fell upon the little parched face lying on the pillow.  \"I know she is going to die!\" she said, with a kind of broken sob. \"I cannot leave her. How can anyone dare to ask me to leave my little child just now?\" Her agitation became more terrible each moment. She was evidently on the verge of hysterics.  Dorothy walked straight from the nursery to a sort of dressing-room which lay beyond. There was a small bed there, which was sometimes occupied by the under-nurse. A scared-looking, tired young woman was standing in this room. Dorothy gave her quick directions. \"Get clean sheets, and make this bed up immediately,\" she said.  The girl started, but looked relieved at having anything explicit to do. She ran off to obey, and Dorothy came back to the sickroom.  \"Hush!\" she said, going up to Mrs. Harvey, who was standing shaking from head to foot with dry sobs. \"You must not give way like this; it is very wrong. Remember you have not only yourself to think of.\" She bent forward and whispered a word in the young mother's ear. Mrs. Harvey started, and with a violent effort controlled herself.  \"I see that you must not be separated from your child,\" continued Dorothy--\"at least, not at present. I am having a bed made up for you in the dressing-room, where you will be within call.\"  \"Ah, yes, that's better,\" said the poor lady--\"that's much better.\"  \"Come, then, at once,\" said Dorothy. She held out her hand. Mrs. Harvey crossed the room. She and Dorothy disappeared into the dressing-room.  In ten minutes the nurse came back to Dr. Staunton. \"I have undressed her, and she is in bed,\" she said. \"She is very weak, and in a terribly nervous condition; she ought to sleep for hours. Will you prepare a composing draught for her it once?\"  \"Yes,\" said the doctor; \"I have brought some medicines with me.\"  He went out of the room, and returned in a minute or two with a small dose in a glass.  Dorothy took it into the dressing-room. Mrs. Harvey's tired eyes were shut already.  \"Now, you're to drink this,\" said Dorothy, raising her head slightly. \"Drink this--don't open your eyes. Trust. Lean on me, if you like. Believe me, that nothing would induce me not to call you if your child were in real danger, but you must sleep now--sleep, and try to believe that all will be well.\"  \"You comfort me, nurse,\" said Mrs. Harvey. \"You are strong. I somehow believe in you.\"  \"You may do so,\" said Dorothy. She bent down and kissed the hot lips. She absolutely forgot that she was only the nurse, and that the tired woman in the bed was a lady of high position. At such a moment as this they were only two women, two sisters.  Dorothy waited for a moment to see the sleeping draught take effect, then, drawing down the blind, she left the room, closing the door softly behind her.  When she returned to the nursery, Dr. Staunton was bending over little Freda, who had opened her eyes, and was moaning in terrible pain.  \"The fever is better,\" he said, turning to the nurse; \"the feverish stage is over, and of course, although we may expect and must guard against complications, there is no reason why the child should not do well as far as that is concerned, but the state of the throat is the real anxiety. I do not like to suggest such a terrible operation as tracheotomy, but if the child does not get relief before long, I fear there is no help for it, and it must be performed.\"  Dorothy bent down and examined the little patient carefully.  \"I have had a good deal of experience in these cases,\" she said, after a pause, \"and have found \"--she mentioned a certain remedy which could be inhaled--\"work wonders, especially in the cases of children.\"  \"I have not heard of it,\" said Dr. Staunton, knitting his brows in anxiety, \"but it sounds simple, and I see no harm in trying it.\"  \"It is very simple,\" said Dorothy. \"I should like to try it.\"  The child moaned and tossed on her pillow.  The doctor went out of the room to prepare the medicine which the nurse had recommended, and Dorothy called one of the frightened servants to her side."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19761"],["title","A Girl in Ten Thousand (#5)"],["body","told her that she meant to take the child up and walk about the room with her in her arms.  \"While she is out of bed I will have the windows closed,\" said the nurse, \"and of course she must be well wrapped up in blankets. She may drop off to sleep again in my arms; anyhow, the change of position and the slight movement will be most refreshing to her. Will you make the bed and put on clean sheets while I am walking about with the child?\"  The girl promised to obey.  \"It is very infectious, ain't it, miss?\" she said suddenly.  \"It is in God's hands,\" replied the nurse.  There was a sound in her voice, a sort of thrill of strength, which subjugated the girl at once, and made her forget her fears. She obeyed the nurse's directions with a will; and when, in an hour's time, Dr. Staunton returned with the remedy which Nurse Dorothy had suggested, he scarcely knew the sickroom.  The little child had been laid back again in bed. Her long hair was combed away from her pale, worn face, Dorothy had plaited it neatly; the little face was washed, and looked almost cool compared with its old flushed and weary condition. The bed was neat, and in perfect order, with snowy sheets. The tired little head rested on a cool pillow. Dorothy and the maid had removed the carpets from the floor, and the room was sprinkled with a disinfectant. Two of the windows were open, and a faint sweet breath of air from the garden outside blew into the room.  \"Why, nurse, this is an admirable change,\" said the doctor.  \"It is necessary,\" replied Nurse Dorothy. \"There is no chance of recovery without fresh air and a cool, quiet, calm atmosphere. I think Rhoda\"--she looked at the servant as she spoke--\"will help me with this case, and I should like as few other people as possible in the room. I have promised Mrs. Harvey to call her if there is any change for the worse in the child, but my impression is she will soon be better.\"  \"God grant it!\" said the doctor.  \"What a blessing a good, properly-trained nurse is!\" he thought, as he went off to the room which had been prepared for him, and where he was glad to take an hour or two of much-needed rest.     CHAPTER IV.   All through the long hours of that day Dorothy watched by the sick child. The child was on the Borderland. Her life hung in the balance--a feather's weight on either side and she would go to the country from which there is no return, or she would become well again. Dorothy's efforts were directed to turning the balance in the scale toward life.  Notwithstanding all her care, however, and all the alleviations which she used, the sick child suffered and moaned terribly. The awful state of the throat, the terrible prostration caused by this form of blood poisoning, were no light foes to have to beat and conquer. But unceasing care presently produced a happy result, and toward evening the high temperature went down a couple of degrees, and the child's breathing became less difficult.  \"I believe she will recover,\" said Dorothy, looking at Dr. Staunton, who had just come into the room. \"I hope you agree with me, doctor, in thinking that she is rather better?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"she is better; she is less feverish, and her breathing is easier. You have done wonders already.\"  \"What happy news for her poor mother! I am so glad that I can tell her that the child is really better,\" said Dorothy. \"I want to induce her to give the little creature altogether into my care for the present, and not to come near her again unless a change for the worse should set in. I hear Mrs. Harvey stirring now in the next room, so she may be in at any moment. May I speak to her, doctor? Do you give me leave to tell her that her child is on the mend, and that you would rather she kept out of the room?\"  \"I would do anything in the world to keep her out of the room,\" said the doctor. \"Yes, I give you full leave to say what you please. You would have more influence with her than I should have. I am almost as great a stranger to her as you are. Use your strongest influence, nurse--do what you can. I believe in you. I am sure she will do the same.\"  \"I'll go into the day nursery and wash my hands before I see Mrs. Harvey,\" said Dorothy.  She was scarcely a moment away. In a couple of minutes she was standing by Mrs. Harvey's bed.  Exhausted by her days and nights of watching, the tired-out mother had slept all through the long hours of the day. She opened her eyes now with a start. Healing sleep had done wonders for her--the dewy look of youth had come back to her face; her beautiful blue eyes were fixed for a moment on Dorothy with a puzzled expression of non-recognition.  \"Where am I? What has happened?\" she asked in a startled voice.  \"You have just had a lovely sleep,\" said Dorothy. \"You'll be all the better for it.\"  \"And who are you? I cannot quite collect my thoughts--I know something has happened. Who are you? I cannot remember you.\"  \"I am the nurse who is taking care of your dear little girl. She is better.\"  \"Oh, yes, now I remember,\" said Mrs. Harvey. She sat up in bed and clasped her hands tightly.  \"It was wrong of me to sleep so long,\" she said, \"but I won't be a moment getting dressed; I must go back to the child at once.\"  \"Will you come to your room?\" said Dorothy. \"You can change your dress there. I know Mr. Harvey is most anxious that you should dine with him this evening.\"  \"Dine with my husband!--have dinner? But Freda is ill; she is at death's door.\"  \"She is ill undoubtedly, but she is better; she is on the mend. I am taking good care of her. Don't you trust me?\"  \"Oh, yes, I trust you; but I must go back to her. Don't talk to me of dinner; I could not eat. Is it really evening? Oh, now I remember everything--at last I remember! We have been in agony. We have lived through such a week. We have been down in the depths, truly. Yes, yes, I recollect it all--my little child, my only little child, my darling, my treasure! Oh, nurse, you should not have allowed me to sleep on all day, you should have called me; she may have been wanting me. But you say she is better--better; but perhaps Dr. Staunton--oh, I am frightened! Are you keeping anything from me? Oh, my head, my poor head! I shall go mad; I shall lose my senses.\"  \"No, dear Mrs. Harvey,\" said Dorothy; \"I have good news for you, not bad. Freda is really better--she is less feverish, and her throat does not hurt her so badly. I don't pretend that she is yet out of danger, but if she continues to improve as she has done during the last seven or eight hours, she will be out of danger before long. Now I want you to take care of yourself and to trust your child to me.\"  \"Oh, I cannot give the child up to anyone. You must not keep me from her another moment. I am not a bit hungry, but I'll have something to eat in her room if you'll bring it to me. How awfully my darling must have missed me!--she is such a child for her mother. Let me go to her at once--my dear little treasure!\"  \"Dr. Staunton is very anxious that you should not go to her to-night.\"  \"How can he dare to keep a mother from her child? Here, give me my dress, will you? I tell you that nothing will keep me from the room. I am sure you are deceiving me.\"  \"Do you really think I would deceive you?\" said Dorothy. \"Before you went to sleep you promised to trust me. Look at me now--look into my eyes. I have nursed a great many sick children--I have seen many mothers in agony--I have never deceived one. When the truth was good I have told it; when it was bad I have also told it. I am not deceiving you, Mrs. Harvey.\"  Poor Mrs. Harvey's dazed and frightened eyes gazed into Dorothy's strong face. Its repose, its calm, impressed her. She was in an overstrung and highly hysterical state. She burst into tears.  \"I do trust you, nurse,\" she said, with a great sob. \"I trust you, and I bless you. I know my dear little one is better. Oh, thank God; thank the great and good God! But, dear nurse, I must go to her. You are tired, and I am quite rested and refreshed. I'll spend the night with the child, and you can go to bed.\"  \"No, dear madam; I cannot resign the care of the child to anyone. I am using a certain remedy in the form of a spray which no one in this house understands but me. If that remedy--which has made the child better--is not continued unceasingly during the whole of this night, her throat will get as bad as ever, and there will be no hope of her recovery. I want you, Mrs. Harvey, to sleep to-night, and leave the child in my care, I wish this, and the doctor wishes it, and I am sure, if you asked your husband, he would tell you that he wished the same. You are not required to do anything for little Freda, and it is your duty to take care of yourself. If she gets worse, I promise to come for you--I promise this, Mrs. Harvey. Now, will you go to your room and dress, and then go downstairs and have some dinner? In the morning I expect to have splendid news for you.\"  Mrs. Harvey clasped her hands in perplexity and uncertainty.  \"It is dreadful to keep a mother from her child,\" she said; \"and yet--and yet----\"  \"And yet in this case it is right,\" said Dorothy. \"You must remember that you have not only Freda to think of. There is your husband, and----\"  \"Oh, yes, I know; there is my poor little unhappy baby, but I cannot love it as I love Freda.\"  \"Still you owe it a duty. It is not right of you to do anything to risk its life or your own. When it comes to you, you will see how dearly you love it. Now, please, let me take you to your room.\"  \"But may I not take one peep at my little treasure?\"  \"She is asleep just now, and you may wake her. Please let me take you to your room.\"  Mrs. Harvey staggered to her feet.  \"I trust you, nurse,\" she said, with a wistful sort of look. \"You will remember your promise?\"  \"I will; nothing in the world will make me go back from my word. Now, come with me.\"  Dorothy led Mrs. Harvey away. They walked down the corridor together. The nurse opened a"]]]
