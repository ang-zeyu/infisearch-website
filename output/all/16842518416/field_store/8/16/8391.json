The Preamble or preface to these Articles really comes to this: \"It is upon the Navy that, under the providence of God, the wealth, prosperity, and peace of the British Empire chiefly depend.\"  Between the death of Henry V in 1422 and the accession of Henry VII in 1485 there was a dreary time on land and sea.  The King of England lost the last of his possessions in the land of France.  Only the Channel Islands remained British, as they do still.  At home the Normans had settled down with the descendants of the other Norsemen to form one people, the Anglo-Norman people of today, the leading race within the British Empire and, to a less extent, within the United States.  But England was torn in two by the Wars of the Roses, in which the great lords and their followers fought about the succession to the throne, each party wanting to have a king of its own choice.  For the most part, however, the towns and seaports kept out of these selfish party wars and attended to their growing business instead.  And when Henry VII united both the warring parties, and these with the rest of England, he helped to lay the sure foundations of the future British Empire.     CHAPTER VII  KING OF THE ENGLISH SEA  (1545)  England needed good pilots to take the ship of state safely through the troubled waters of the wonderful sixteenth century, and she found them in the three great Royal Tudors: Henry VII (1485-1509), Henry VIII (1509-1547), and Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603).  All three fostered English sea-power, both for trade and war, and helped to start the modern Royal Navy on a career of world-wide victory such as no other fighting service has ever equalled, not even the Roman Army in the palmy days of Rome.  It was a happy thought that gave the name of Queen Elizabeth to the flagship on board of which the British Commander-in-chief received the surrender of the German Fleet.  Ten generations had passed away between this surrender in 1918 and the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.  But the British Royal Navy was still the same: in sea-sense, spirit, training, and surpassing skill.  Henry VII was himself an oversea trader, and a very good one too.  He built ships and let them out to traders at a handsome profit for himself besides trading with them on his own account.  But he was never so foolish as to think that peaceful trade could go on without a fighting navy to protect it.  So he built men-of-war; though he used these for trade as well.  Men-of-war built specially for fighting were of course much better in a battle than any mere merchantman could be. But in those days, and for some time after, merchantmen went about well armed and often joined the king's ships of the Royal Navy during war, as many of them did against the Germans in our own day.  English oversea trade was carried on with the whole of Europe, with Asia Minor, and with the North of Africa.  Canyng, a merchant prince of Bristol, employed a hundred shipwrights and eight hundred seamen.  He sent his ships to Iceland, the Baltic, and all through the Mediterranean.  But the London merchants were more important still; and the king was the most important man of all.  He had his watchful eye on the fishing fleet of Iceland, which was then as important as the fleet of Newfoundland became later on.  He watched the Baltic trade in timber and the Flanders trade in wool.  He watched the Hansa Towns of northern Germany, then second only to Venice itself as the greatest trading centre of the world.  And he had his English consuls in Italy as early as 1485, the first year of his reign.  One day Columbus sent his brother to see if the king would help him to find the New World.  But Henry VII was a man who looked long and cautiously before he leaped; and even then he only leaped when he saw where he would land.  So Columbus went to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, who sent him out to discover America in 1492, the same year that they conquered the last Eastern possession in Western Europe, the Moorish Kingdom of Grenada, which thenceforth became a province of Spain.  Five years later Henry sent John Cabot out from Bristol in the little _Matthew_ with only eighteen men \"to sayle to all Partes, Countreys, and Seas, of the East, of the West, and of the North; to seeke out, discover, and finde, whatsoever Iles, Countreyes, Regions, or Provinces, of the Heathennes and Infidelles\" and \"to set up Our banners and Ensigns in every village, towne, castel, yle, or maine lande, of them newly found.\"  Cabot discovered Canada by reaching Cape Breton in 1497, three years before Columbus himself saw any part of the mainland.  But as he found nobody there, not even \"Heathenries and Infidelles,\" much less \"villages, castels, and townes,\" as he lost money by his venture and could not pay the king the promised \"royalty\" of twenty per cent., we need not laugh too loudly over what the king gave him: \"To Hym that founde the new Isle--10 pounds,\" which was worth more than a thousand dollars would be now.  Cabot went again and his son Sebastian after him; but there was no money to be made in this venture.  True, Sebastian said the fish off Newfoundland were so thick that he could hardly force his vessels through the water.  But fish stories and travellers' tales were as hard to believe then as now; and the English thought America was worth very little after all.  Indeed, the general opinion in Europe was that America was more of a nuisance than anything else, because it seemed to block the way to the Golden East.  Once people were persuaded that the world was round they wanted to find a short cut to Cathay, the land of fabled wealth in silks and spices, gold and jewels; and they expected to find it by sailing due West till they reached the Far East.  So, finding instead that America had no such riches on its own shores and that these shores spoilt the short cut to Cathay, and knowing that fish were plentiful in Europe, most people never bothered their heads about America for another fifty years.

Douglass for Trinity House.]  We shall soon see what wonderful changes took place when the Old World at last discovered the riches of the New, and all the European sea-powers began fighting for the best places they could find there.  When Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509 his first thought was for the \"Broade Ditch,\" as he called the English Channel.  In 1546, only a little before he died, he appointed a Navy Board, which answered its purpose so well that it looked after the pay, food, stores, docks, and ships of the Royal Navy for nearly three hundred years; and then became part of the Admiralty, which now does everything for the Navy that can be done from the land.  In one word, this Board took care of everything except the fighting part of the Navy's work.  That part was under the Lord High Admiral or a body of men appointed to act for him.  This body still exists; and the old Board of Henry VIII works with it under different names.  One branch of the Admiralty, as the whole management is now called, supplies the other with the means to fight.  This other orders everything connected with the fighting fleets.  The fighting fleets themselves are then left to do the best they can.  Henry never forgot for a moment that England could not live a day if she was not a mighty sea-power.  He improved the dockyards founded by his father at Deptford and Portsmouth.  He founded Trinity House, which still examines pilots and looks after the lights and buoys all round the British Isles.  He put down pirates with a strong hand.  And he brought the best ship-builders he could get from Italy, where the scientific part of shipbuilding and navigation was then the best in the world, because the trade routes of Asia, Africa, and Europe mostly met at Venice.  But he always kept his eyes open for good men at home; and in one of his own shipbuilders, Fletcher of Rye, he found a man who did more than anybody else to make the vastly important change from the ancient age of rowing fleets to the modern age of sailing ones.  From the time when the first bit of a wild beast's skin was hoisted by some pre-historic savage, thousands and thousands of years ago, nobody had learnt how to tack, that is, to sail against the wind.  The only way any ship could go at all well was with the wind, that is, with the wind blowing from behind.  So long as men had nothing but a single \"wind-bag\" of skin or cloth the best wind was a \"lubber's wind,\" that is, a wind from straight behind.  When more and better sails were used a lubber's wind was not the best because one sail would stop the wind from reaching another one in front of it.  The best wind then, as ever since, was a \"quartering wind,\" that is, a wind blowing on a vessel's quarter, half way between her stern and the middle of her side.  Ships with better keels, sails, and shape of hull might have sailed with a \"soldier's wind,\" that is, a wind blowing straight against the ship's side, at right angles to her course.  But they must have \"made leeway\" by going sideways too.  This wind on the beam was called a soldier's wind because it made equally plain sailing out and back again, and so did not bother landsmen with a lot of words and things they could not understand when ships tacked against head winds.

The prehistoric animals, too, undoubtedly had their     play time, with games and \"setting up\" exercises                  35    The mother opossum is never happier than when she has her little ones     playing hide-and-seek over her back                               38    This young fox came from his home in the woods daily to play with a     young fox-terrier.

These horse-tailed monkeys chatter together in     a language exclusively their own, yet they seem to have no difficulty     in making themselves understood by other monkey-tribes           112    A tamed deer of Texas, whose constant companion and playmate was     a rabbit dog. Between the two, there developed, necessarily, a     common language                                                  113    Water-loving animals, like the beavers, seemingly take great pride in     their toilets.

Like the common domesticated     hogs, they will seek a clay bath to heal their wounds            123    The Rocky Mountain goat has many means of defence, not the least of     which is his agility in climbing to inaccessible places          134    Wild boars are among the most ferocious of animals. By means of     their great strength alone they are well able to defend     themselves                                                       135    Brontosaurus.

After shaking down berries or grapes,     they roll in them, then hurry home with the food attached to     their quills                                                     173    The black bear is not one of the great migrating animals. The thickness     of his coat must therefore change with the seasons               188    Rabbits seem to have a well-devised system in their road-building,     running their paths in and out of underbrush in a truly ingenious     manner                                                           189    The mongoose, a scavenger of the worst type, feeding on rats and     mice and snakes, and even poultry                                202    Diplodocus. The prehistoric animals, also, undoubtedly had their     scavengers and criminals                                         203    The Esquimo-dog is man's greatest friend in the Far North          218    Chipmunks are among the most easily tamed of man's wild friends,     and they even seem fond of human companionship                   219    Men cruelly take the lives of these denizens of the wildwood, rejoicing     in their slaughter, but the animal soul they cannot kill         244    Two pals. There is between man and dog a kinship of spirit that cannot     be denied                                                        245     FOREWORD    _\"And in the lion or the frog--   In all the life of moor or fen--   In ass and peacock, stork and dog,   He read similitudes of men.\"_  More and more science is being taught in a new way. More and more men are beginning to discard the lumber of the brain's workshop to get at real facts, real conclusions. Laboratories, experiments, tables, classifications are all very vital and all very necessary but sometimes their net result is only to befog and confuse. Occasionally it becomes important for us to cast aside all dogmatic restraints and approach the wonders of life from a new angle and with the untrammelled spirit of a little child.  In this book I have attempted to bring together many old and new observations which tend to show the human-like qualities of animals. The treatment is neither formal nor scholastic, in fact I do not always remain within the logical confines of the title. My sole purpose is to make the reader self-active, observative, free from hide-bound prejudice, and reborn as a participant in the wonderful experiences of life which fill the universe. I hope to lead him into a new wonderland of truth, beauty and love, a land where his heart as well as his eyes will be opened.  In attempting to understand the animals I have used a method a great deal like that of the village boy, who when questioned as to how he located the stray horse for which a reward of twenty dollars had been offered, replied, \"I just thought what I would do if I were a horse and where I would go--and there I went and found him.\" In some such way I have tried to think why animals do certain things, I have studied them in many places and under all conditions, and those acts of theirs which, if performed by children, would come under the head of wisdom and intelligence, I have classified as such.  Life is one throughout. The love that fills a mother's heart when she sees her first-born babe, is also felt by the mother bear, only in a different way, when she sees her baby cubs playing before her humble cave dwelling. The sorrow that is felt by the human heart when a beloved one dies is experienced in only a little less degree by an African ape when his mate is shot dead by a Christian missionary. The grandmother sheep that watches her numerous little lamb grandchildren on the hillside, while their mothers are away grazing, is just as mindful of their care as any human"]]]
