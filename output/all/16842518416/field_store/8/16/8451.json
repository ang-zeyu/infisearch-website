I have been asking myself the question, Why did Germany, deliberately, in the third year of the war, provoke America to this declaration and to this action--deliberately, resolutely?  It has been suggested that the reason was that there were certain elements in American life, and the Hohenzollerns were under the impression that they would make it impossible for the United States to declare war.  That I can hardly believe.  But the answer has been afforded by Marshal von Hindenburg himself, in the very remarkable interview which appeared in the press, I think, only this morning.  He depended clearly on one of two things.  First, that the submarine campaign would have destroyed international shipping to such an extent that England would have been put out of business before America was ready.  According to his computation, America cannot be ready for twelve months.  He does not know America.  Second, that when America is ready, at the end of twelve months, with her army, she will have no ships to transport that army to the field of battle.  In von Hindenburg's words, \"America carries no weight.\"  I suppose he means she has no ships to carry weight.  On that, undoubtedly, they are reckoning.  Well, it is not wise always to assume that even when the German General Staff, which has miscalculated so often, makes a calculation it has no ground for it.  It therefore behooves the whole of the Allies, Great Britain and America in particular, to see that that reckoning of von Hindenburg is as false as the one he made about his famous line, which we have broken already.  The road to victory, the guarantee of victory, the absolute assurance of victory is to be found in one word--ships; and a second word--ships. And with that quickness of apprehension which characterizes your nation, I see that they fully realize that, and today I observe that they have already made arrangements to build one thousand 3000-tonners for the Atlantic.  I think that the German military advisers must already begin to realize that this is another of the tragic miscalculations which are going to lead them to disaster and to ruin. But you will pardon me for emphasizing that.  We are a slow people in these islands--slow and blundering--but we get there.  You get there sooner, and that is why I am glad to see you in.  But may I say that we have been in this business for three years?  We have, as we generally do, tried every blunder.  In golfing phraseology, we have got into every bunker.  But we have got a good niblick.  We are right out on the course.  But may I respectfully suggest that it is worth America's while to study our blunders, so as to begin just where we are now and not where we were three years ago?  That is an advantage.  In war, time has as tragic a significance as it has in sickness.  A step which, taken today, may lead to assured victory, taken tomorrow may barely avert disaster.  All the Allies have discovered that.  It was a new country for us all.  It was trackless, mapless.  We had to go by instinct.  But we found the way, and I am so glad that you are sending your great naval and military experts here just to exchange experiences with men who have been through all the dreary, anxious crises of the last three years.  America has helped us even to win the battle of Arras.  The guns which destroyed the German trenches, shattered the barbed wire--I remember, with some friends of mine whom I see here, arranging to order the machines to make those guns from America.  Not all of them--you got your share, but only a share, a glorious share.  So that America has also had her training.  She has been making guns, making ammunition, giving us machinery to prepare both; she has supplied us with steel, and she has all that organization, and all that wonderful facility, adaptability, and resourcefulness of the great people which inhabits that great continent.  Ah!  It was a bad day for military autocracy in Prussia when it challenged the great republic of the west.  We know what America can do, and we also know that now she is in it she will do it.  She will wage an effective and successful war.  There is something more important.  She will insure a beneficent peace. To this I attach great importance.  I am the last man to say that the succor which is given to us from America is not something in itself to rejoice in, and to rejoice in greatly.  But I do not mind saying that I rejoice even more in the knowledge that America is going to win the right to be at the conference table when the terms of peace are being discussed.  That conference will settle the destiny of nations--the course of human life--for God knows how many ages.  It would have been tragic for mankind if America had not been there, and there with all the influence, all the power, and the right which she has now won by flinging herself into this great struggle.  I can see peace coming now--not a peace which will be the beginning of war, not a peace which will be an endless preparation for strife and bloodshed, but a real peace.  The world is an old world.  It has never had peace.  It has been rocking and swaying like an ocean, and Europe--poor Europe!--has always lived under the menace of the sword. When this war began two-thirds of Europe were under autocratic rule. It is the other way about now, and democracy means peace.  The democracy of France did not want war; the democracy of Italy hesitated long before they entered the war; the democracy of this country shrank from it--shrank and shuddered--and never would have entered the caldron had it not been for the invasion of Belgium.  The democracies sought peace; strove for peace.  If Prussia had been a democracy there would have been no war.  Strange things have happened in this war.  There are stranger things to come, and they are coming rapidly.  There are times in history when this world spins so leisurely along its destined course that it seems for centuries to be at a standstill; but there are also times when it rushes along at a giddy pace, covering the track of centuries in a year.  Those are the times we are living in now.  Today we are waging the most devastating war that the world has ever seen; tomorrow--perhaps not a distant tomorrow--war may be abolished forever from the category of human crimes.  This may be something like the fierce outburst of winter, which we are now witnessing, before the complete triumph of the sun.  It is written of those gallant men who won that victory on Monday--men from Canada, from Australia, and from this old country, which has proved that in spite of its age it is not decrepit--it is written of those gallant men that they attacked with the dawn--fit work for the dawn!--to drive out of forty miles of French soil those miscreants who had defiled it for three years.  \"They attacked with the dawn.\"  Significant phrase!  The breaking up of the dark rule of the Turk, which for centuries has clouded the sunniest land in the world, the freeing of Russia from an oppression which has covered it like a shroud for so long, the great declaration of President Wilson coming with the might of the great nation which he represents into the struggle for liberty, are heralds of the dawn.  \"They attacked with the dawn,\" and these men are marching forward in the full radiance of that dawn, and soon Frenchmen and Americans, British, Italians, Russians, yea, and Serbians, Belgians, Montenegrins, will march into the full light of a perfect day.     THE FIRST TO FALL IN BATTLE  During the trench warfare, it was customary to raid the enemy trenches at unexpected hours, sometimes during the night, often during \"the sleepiest hour,\" just before the dawn.  In such a raid made by the Germans in the early dawn of November 3, 1917, fell the first American soldiers to die in the World War.  The Germans began by shelling the barbed-wire barrier in front of the trenches where the Americans were stationed for a few days, taking their first lessons in trench warfare.  A heavy artillery fire was then directed so as to cover the trenches and the country immediately back of them.  This prevented reinforcements coming into the trenches. Following the barrage a large number of Huns broke through the barbed wire and jumped into the trenches.  The Americans did not fully understand the situation, for it was their first experience with a trench raid.  A wounded private said, \"I was standing in a communicating trench waiting for orders.  I heard a noise back of me and looked around in time to see a German fire in my direction.  I felt a bullet hit my arm.\"  Three Americans were killed.  They were the first fighting under the American flag to fall in battle on the soil of Europe.  They were--  Corporal James B. Gresham, Evansville, Indiana.  Private Merle D. Hay, Glidden, Iowa.  Private Thomas F. Enright, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  On November 6, three graves were dug.  On one side of them stood a line of poilus in their uniforms of horizon blue and red, and on the other a line of American soldiers in khaki.  The flag-covered caskets were lowered, as the bugler sounded \"taps,\" and the batteries fired minute guns.  Then the French officer in command of the division, amid the broken roar of the minute guns and the whistle of shells, paid a tribute to the dead.  \"In the name of this division, in the name of the French army, and in the name of France, I bid farewell to Corporal Gresham, Private Hay, and Private Enright of the American army.  \"Of their own free will they left a happy, prosperous country to come over here.  They knew war was here.  They knew that the forces battling for honor, for justice, and for civilization were still being checked by the forces serving the powers of frightfulness, brute force, and barbarity.  They knew that fighting was still necessary.  Not forgetting historical"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19906"],["title","Winning a Cause: World War Stories (#4)"],["body","s, they wished to give us their brave hearts.  \"They knew all the conditions, nothing had been hidden from them, not the length and hardship of the war, not the violence of battle, not the terrible destruction of the new weapons, not the falseness of the enemy.  Nothing stopped them.  They accepted the hard life, they crossed the ocean at great peril, they took their places at the front beside us; and now they have fallen in a desperate hand-to-hand fight. All honor to them.  \"Men!  These American graves, the first to be dug in the soil of France, and but a short distance from the enemy, are a symbol of the mighty land that has come to aid the Allies, ready to sacrifice as long as may be necessary until the final victory for the most noble of causes, the liberty of peoples and of nations, of the weak as well as the strong.  For this reason the deaths of these humble soldiers take on an extraordinary grandeur.  \"We shall ask that the mortal remains of these young men be left here, left with us forever.  We will inscribe on the tombs, 'Here lie the first soldiers of the Republic of the United States to fall on the soil of France for liberty and justice.'  The passer-by will stop and uncover his head.  Travelers and men of feeling will go out of their way to come here to pay tribute.  \"Corporal Gresham, Private Hay, Private Enright, in the name of France, I thank you.  God receive your souls.  Farewell.\"  As the French officer wished, there they remain.  Soon a worthy monument will be erected upon the ground where they fought and now lie asleep in death.  Americans of this generation and of generations to come will stand in future days with bared heads before that monument and pay tribute.  [Illustration: The religious and military tribute paid to the first Americans to fall in battle, at Bathelmont, November 4, 1917.  General Bordeaux, in the name of the French army,  bade \"farewell to all that was mortal of the three heroes.\"  At this point in the funeral, notice that the American soldiers in the background are standing at \"parade rest.\"]     FOUR SOLDIERS  THE BOCHE  The _boche_ was chiefly what his masters made him.  He was planned and turned out according to specifications.  His leaders and his enemies always knew just what he would do under any given circumstances, and he himself always knew just what he would do.  He would do what he was ordered to do, if he understood the order and had been taught how to execute it; otherwise he would do nothing but stare helplessly.  He was a machine built to order, according to plans and specifications.  \"In critical moments the boche waited for direction instead of relying on himself.  He could not vary a hairbreadth from an order given, even when the variation would have brought success.  He was part of a machine army, a cog in a mechanism which needed a push to make it move; his actions must be dictated or he could not act; his very thoughts were disciplined and uniformed.\"   To the _boche_ there was no chivalry in war.  He fought as the barbarians would have fought, if they had had all his knowledge and equipment, but were still uncivilized.  Women and children never called forth his pity or his mercy.  He would defile and destroy a church or a cathedral with greater pleasure than he would a peasant's hut.  To him there were no laws of war.  War meant to fight, to conquer, to kill, to gain the end by any means whatever.  Dropping bombs on defenseless women and children and on Red Cross hospitals; torpedoing merchant ships without warning and sending all the passengers, even neutrals or friends, to death, or worse, in open boats far from land; firing on stretcher-bearers and nurses; using poison gas and liquid fire; poisoning wells and spreading disease germs; all are forbidden to civilized races by the laws of war.  The _boche_ regularly perpetrated them all and committed other atrocities much worse.  He hoped to frighten the world by his cruelty and brutality, by making every man, woman, and child among his enemies believe that each _boche_ was an unconquerable giant possessed of a devil.  To the _boche_ war was simply a robbery, and he was one of a robber band.  On the land, he was a brigand, on the sea, a pirate.  He went about his business with no more mercy and chivalry than a New York gunman or a Paris apache.  To him war was a business, an unlawful business to be sure, but, he believed, a profitable one.  He went at it, therefore, as he had at manufacturing and commerce in the days of peace.  He sought to do bigger things than any one else and to gain an advantage by any means, fair or foul.  Why should he think about being fair or humane?  He was a thief, not a judge.  And yet let it be recorded that while nearly all _boches_ acted like brutes instead of men, there were some who were different and who showed the highest type of courage and died bravely as soldiers may die.   THE POILU  The soldier of France, the _poilu_, is a crusader.  He is fighting to defend France, his great mother, in whose defense, centuries ago, the invisible powers called and sustained Jeanne d'Arc.  In his love of country there is something almost religious, like that of the Mohammedan for Mecca and Medina.  To serve France, to fight for her, to die for her--and every French soldier expects to die in battle--is a privilege as well as a duty.  He fights for his country as an Englishman fights for his home.  With the Englishman, his home comes first and is nearest and dearest; with the Frenchman, his country.  Philip Gibbs, who has written from day to day, from the trenches and the battlefields, letters that will never be forgotten because of their beauty and truth, says of the French _poilu_:--  \"Yet if the English reader imagines that because this thread of sentiment runs through the character of France there is a softness in the qualities of French soldiers, he does not know the truth.  Those men whom I saw at the front and behind the fighting lines were as hard in moral and spiritual strength as in physical endurance.  It was this very hardness which impressed me even in the beginning of the war, when I did not know the soldiers of France as well as I do now.  After a few weeks in the field these men, who had been laborers and mechanics, clerks and journalists, artists and poets, shop assistants and railway porters, hotel waiters, and young aristocrats of Paris, were toned down to the quality of tempered steel.  With not a spare ounce of flesh on them--the rations of the French army are not as rich as ours--and tested by long marches down dusty roads, by incessant fighting in retreat against overwhelming odds, by the moral torture of those rearguard actions, and by their first experience of indescribable horrors, among dead and dying comrades, they had a beauty of manhood which I found sublime.  They were bronzed and dirty and hairy, but they had the look of knighthood, with a calm light shining in their eyes and with resolute lips.  They had no gayety in those days, when France was in gravest peril, and they did not find any kind of fun in this war. Out of their baptism of fire they had come with scorched souls, knowing the murderous quality of the business to which they were apprenticed, but though they did not hide their loathing of it, nor the fears which had assailed them, nor their passionate anger against the people who had thrust this thing upon them, they showed no sign of weakness.  They were willing to die for France, though they hated death, and in spite of the first great rush of the German legions, they had a fine intellectual contempt of that army, which seemed to me then unjustified, though they were right, as history now shows.  Man against man, in courage and cunning they were better than the Germans, gun against gun they were better, in cavalry charge and in bayonet charge they were better, and in equal number irresistible.\"   THE TOMMY  John Masefield, the English writer, says, \"St. George did not go out against the dragon like that divine calm youth in Carpaccio's picture, nor like that divine calm man in Donatello's statue.  He went out, I think, after some taste of defeat knowing that it was going to be bad, and that the dragon would breathe fire, and that very likely his spear would break, and that he wouldn't see his children again, and people would call him a fool.  He went out, I think, as the battalions of our men went out, a little trembling and a little sick and not knowing much about it, except that it had to be done, and then stood up to the dragon in the mud of that far land and waited for him to come on.\"  [Illustration: Saint George and the Dragon, painted by V. Carpaccio in 1516, Venice; S. Giorgio Maggiore.  The background, as in most medieval paintings, gives scenes that explain further the legend depicted.]  But as soon as the British Tommy had reached the dragon's lair, he became the British player in a great championship game of the nations. He was the British sportsman, hunting big game; for in matters of life or death, he is always the player or the sportsman.  That it was a hideous dragon breathing out poison gas and fire and destroying Christian maidens, made the sport all the more interesting and worth while.  Philip Gibbs says of the English Tommy:--  \"They take great risks sometimes as a kind of sport, as Arctic explorers or big game hunters will face danger and endure great bodily suffering for their own sake.  Those men are natural soldiers.  There are some even who like war, though very few.  But most of them would jeer at any kind of pity for them, because they do not pity themselves, except in most dreadful moments which they put away from their minds if they escape.  They scorn pity, yet they hate worse still, with a most deadly hatred, all the talk about 'our cheerful men.'  For they know that, however cheerful they may be, it is not because of a jolly life or lack of fear.  They loathe shell-fire and machine-gun fire.  They "]]]
