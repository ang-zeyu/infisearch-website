He reigned forty-six years.  The tomb of Edward III., of copper, gilt, with this epitaph:      Of English kings here lieth the beauteous flower     Of all before past, and myrror to them shall sue:     A merciful king, of peace conservator,     The third Edward, &c.  Besides the tomb are these words:            Edward III., whose fame has reached to heaven.  A.D. 1377.                            Fight for your country.  Here is shown his sword, eight feet in length, which they say he used in the conquest of France.  His queen’s epitaph:       Here lies Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III.  Learn to live.  A.D.                                     1369.  At a little distance, the tomb of Henry V., with this legend:       Henry, the scourge of France, lies in this tomb.  Virtue subdues all                              things.  A.D. 1422.  Near this lies the coffin of Catherine, unburied, and to be opened by anyone that pleases.  On the outside is this inscription:           Fair Catherine is at length united to her lord.  A.D. 1437.                                 Shun idleness.  The tomb of Henry III., of brass, gilt, with this epitaph:          Henry III., the founder of this cathedral.  A.D. 1273.  War is                        delightful to the unexperienced.  It was this Henry who, one hundred and sixty years after Edward the Confessor had built this church, took it down, and raised an entire new one of beautiful architecture, supported by rows of marble columns, and its roof covered with sheets of lead, a work of fifty years before its completion.  It has been much enlarged at the west end by the abbots. After the expulsion of the monks, it experienced many changes; first it had a dean and prebendaries; then a bishop, who, having squandered the revenues, resigned it again to a dean.  In a little time, the monks with their abbot were reinstated by Queen Mary; but, they being soon ejected again by authority of parliament, it was converted into a cathedral church—nay, into a seminary for the Church—by Queen Elizabeth, who instituted there twelve prebendaries, an equal number of invalid soldiers, and forty scholars; who at a proper time are elected into the universities, and are thence transplanted into the Church and State.  Next to be seen is the tomb of Eleanor, daughter of Alphonso King of Spain, and wife of Edward I., with this inscription:                      This Eleanor was consort of Edward I.                           A.D. 1298.  Learn to die.  The tomb of Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VII.  In the middle of this chapel is the shrine of St. Edward, the last King of the Saxons.  It is composed of marble in mosaic: round it runs this inscription in letters of gold:                  The venerable king, St. Edward the Confessor,                       A heroe adorned with every virtue.                      He died on the 5th of January, 1065,                            And mounted into Heaven.                              Lift up your hearts.  The third choir, of surprising splendour and elegance, was added to the east end by Henry VII. for a burying-place for himself and his posterity. Here is to be seen his magnificent tomb, wrought of brass and marble, with this epitaph:      Here lies Henry VII. of that name, formerly King of England, son of     Edmund, Earl of Richmond, who, ascending the throne on the     twenty-second day of August, was crowned on the thirtieth of October     following at Westminster, in the year of our Lord 1485.  He died on     the twenty-first of April, in the fifty-third year of his age, after     a reign of twenty-two years and eight months wanting a day.  This monument is enclosed with rails of brass, with a long epitaph in Latin verse.  Under the same tomb lies buried Edward VI., King of England, son of Henry VIII. by Jane Seymour.  He succeeded to his father when he was but nine years old, and died A.T. 1553, on the 6th of July, in the sixteenth year of his age, and of his reign the seventh, not without suspicion of poison.  Mary was proclaimed queen by the people on the 19th of July, and died in November, 1558, and is buried in some corner of the same choir, without any inscription.                                 Queen Elizabeth.      Here lies Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., sister of King     Edward V., wife of Henry VII., and the glorious mother of Henry VIII.     She died in the Tower of London, on the eleventh of February, A.D.     1502, in the thirty-seventh year of her age.  Between the second and third choirs in the side-chapels, are the tombs of Sebert, King of the East Saxons, who built this church with stone: and  Of Margaret of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., grandmother of Henry VIII.; she gave this monastery to the monks of Winbourne, {27} who preached and taught grammar all England over, and appointed salaries to two professors of divinity, one at Oxford, another at Cambridge, where she founded two colleges to Christ and to John His disciple.  She died A.D. 1463, on the third of the calends of July.  And of Margaret, Countess of Lenox, grandmother of James VI., King of Scotland.  William of Valance, half-brother of Henry III.  The Earl of Cornwall, brother of Edward III.  Upon another tomb is an honorary inscription for Frances, Duchess of Suffolk.  The sense of it is,      That titles, royal birth, riches, or a large family, are of no avail:     That all are transitory; virtue alone resisting the funeral pile.     That this lady was first married to a duke, then to Stoke, a     gentleman;     And lastly, by the grave espoused to CHRIST.  The next is the tomb of Lord Russell, son of the Earl of Bedford, whose lady composed the following Greek and Latin verses, and had them engraved on the marble:—      How was I startled at the cruel feast,     By death’s rude hands in horrid manner drest;     Such grief as sure no hapless woman knew,     When thy pale image lay before my view.     Thy father’s heir in beauteous form arrayed     Like flowers in spring, and fair, like them to fade;     Leaving behind unhappy wretched me,     And all thy little orphan-progeny:     Alike the beauteous face, the comely air,     The tongue persuasive, and the actions fair,     Decay: so learning too in time shall waste:     But faith, chaste lovely faith, shall ever last.     The once bright glory of his house, the pride     Of all his country, dusty ruins hide:     Mourn, hapless orphans; mourn, once happy wife;     For when he died, died all the joys of life.     Pious and just, amidst a large estate,     He got at once the name of good and great.     He made no flatt’ring parasite his guest,     But asked the good companions to the feast.  Anne, Countess of Oxford, daughter of William Cecil, Baron Burleigh, and Lord Treasurer.  Philippa, daughter and co-heiress of John, Lord Mohun of Dunster, wife of Edward, Duke of York.  Frances, Countess of Sussex, of the ancient family of Sidney.  Thomas Bromley, Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth.  The Earl of Bridgewater, {29} Lord Dawbney, Lord Chamberlain to Henry VII., and his lady.  And thus much for Westminster.  There are many other churches in this city, but none so remarkable for the tombs of persons of distinction.  Near to this church is Westminster Hall, where, besides the Sessions of Parliament, which are often held there, are the Courts of Justice; and at stated times are heard their trials in law, or concerning the king’s patrimony, or in chancery, which moderates the severity of the common law by equity.  Till the time of Henry I. the Prime Court of Justice was movable, and followed the King’s Court, but he enacted by the Magna Charta that the common pleas should no longer attend his Court, but be held at some determined place.  The present hall was built by King Richard II. in the place of an ancient one which he caused to be taken down.  He made it part of his habitation (for at that time the Kings of England determined causes in their own proper person, and from the days of Edward the Confessor had their palace adjoining), till, above sixty years since, upon its being burnt, Henry VIII. removed the royal residence to Whitehall, situated in the neighbourhood, which a little before was the house of Cardinal Wolsey.  This palace is truly royal, enclosed on one side by the Thames, on the other by a park, which connects it with St. James’s, another royal palace.  In the chamber where the Parliament is usually held, the seats and wainscot are made of wood, the growth of Ireland; said to have that occult quality, that all poisonous animals are driven away by it; and it is affirmed for certain, that in Ireland there are neither serpents, toads, nor any other venomous creature to be found.  Near this place are seen an immense number of swans, who wander up and down the river for some miles, in great security; nobody daring to molest, much less kill any of them, under penalty of a considerable fine.  In Whitehall are the following things worthy of observation:—  I.  The Royal Library, well stored with Greek, Latin, Italian and French books; amongst the rest, a little one in French upon parchment, in the handwriting of the present reigning Queen Elizabeth, thus inscribed:—                To the most high, puissant, and redoubted prince,                Henry VIII. of the name, King of England, France                      and Ireland, Defender of the Faith;                      Elizabeth, his most humble daughter.                             Health and obedience.  All these books are bound in velvet in different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls and precious stones set in their bindings.  II.  Two little silver cabinets of exquisite work, in which the Queen keeps her paper, and which she uses for writing boxes.  III.  The Queen’s bed, ingeniously composed of woods of different colours, with quilts of silk, velvet, gold, silver, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1992"],["title","Travels in England During the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, and Fragmenta Regalia; (#3)"],["body","embroidery.  IV.  A little chest ornamented all over with pearls, in which the Queen keeps her bracelets, ear-rings, and other things of extraordinary value.  V.  Christ’s Passion, in painted glass.  VI.  Portraits: among which are, Queen Elizabeth, at sixteen years old; Henry, Richard, Edward, Kings of England; Rosamond; Lucrece, a Grecian bride, in her nuptial habit; the genealogy of the Kings of England; a picture of King Edward VI., representing at first sight something quite deformed, till by looking through a small hole in the cover which is put over it, you see it in its true proportions; Charles V., Emperor; Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy, and Catherine of Spain, his wife; Ferdinand, Duke of Florence, with his daughters; one of Philip, King of Spain, when he came into England and married Mary; Henry VII., Henry VIII., and his mother; besides many more of illustrious men and women; and a picture of the Siege of Malta.  VII.  A small hermitage, half hid in a rock, finely carved in wood.  VIII.  Variety of emblems on paper, cut in the shape of shields, with mottoes, used by the mobility at tilts and tournaments, hung up here for a memorial.  IX.  Different instruments of music, upon one of which two persons may perform at the same time.  X.  A piece of clock-work, an Ethiop riding upon a rhinoceros, with four attendants, who all make their obeisance when it strikes the hour; these are all put into motion by winding up the machine.  At the entrance into the park from Whitehall is this inscription:—      The fisherman who has been wounded, learns, though late, to beware;     But the unfortunate Actæon always presses on.           The chaste virgin naturally pitied:     But the powerful goddess revenged the wrong.           Let Actæon fall a prey to his dogs,                 An example to youth,        A disgrace to those that belong to him!           May Diana live the care of Heaven;              The delight of mortals;        The security of those that belong to her! {34}  In this park is great plenty of deer.  In a garden joining to this palace there is a _jet d’eau_, with a sun-dial, which while strangers are looking at, a quantity of water, forced by a wheel which the gardener turns at a distance, through a number of little pipes, plentifully sprinkles those that are standing round.  Guildhall, a fine structure built by Thomas Knowles.  Here are to be seen the statues of two giants, said to have assisted the English when the Romans made war upon them: Corinius of Britain, and Gogmagog of Albion. Beneath upon a table the titles of Charles V., Emperor, are written in letters of gold.  The government of London is this: the city is divided into twenty-five regions or wards; the Council is composed of twenty-four aldermen, one of whom presides over every ward.  And whereas of old the chief magistrate was a portreeve, _i.e._, governor of the city, Richard I. appointed two bailiffs; instead of which King John gave a power by grant of choosing annually a mayor from any of the twelve principal companies, and to name two sheriffs, one of whom to be called the king’s, the other the city’s. It is scarce credible how this city increased, both in public and private buildings, upon establishing this form of government.  _Vide_ Camden’s “Britannia,” Middlesex.  It is worthy of observation, that every year, upon St. Bartholomew’s Day, when the fair is held, it is usual for the mayor, attended by the twelve principal aldermen, to walk in a neighbouring field, dressed in his scarlet gown, and about his neck a golden chain, to which is hung a golden fleece, {36a} and besides, that particular ornament {36b} which distinguishes the most noble order of the garter.  During the year of his magistracy, he is obliged to live so magnificently, that foreigner or native, without any expense, is free, if he can find a chair empty, to dine at his table, where there is always the greatest plenty.  When the mayor goes out of the precincts of the city, a sceptre, a sword, and a cap, are borne before him, and he is followed by the principal aldermen in scarlet gowns, with gold chains; himself and they on horseback.  Upon their arrival at a place appointed for that purpose, where a tent is pitched, the mob begin to wrestle before them, two at a time; the conquerors receive rewards from the magistrates.  After this is over, a parcel of live rabbits are turned loose among the crowd, which are pursued by a number of boys, who endeavour to catch them, with all the noise they can make.  While we were at this show, one of our company, Tobias Salander, doctor of physic, had his pocket picked of his purse, with nine crowns du soleil, which, without doubt, was so cleverly taken from him by an Englishman who always kept very close to him, that the doctor did not in the least perceive it.  The Castle or Tower of London, called Bringwin, and Tourgwin, in Welsh, from its whiteness, is encompassed by a very deep and broad ditch, as well as a double wall very high.  In the middle of the whole is that very ancient and very strong tower, enclosed with four others, which, in the opinion of some, was built by Julius Cæsar.  Upon entering the tower, we were obliged to quit our swords at the gate and deliver them to the guard.  When we were introduced, we were shown above a hundred pieces of arras belonging to the Crown, made of gold, silver, and silk; several saddles covered with velvet of different colours; an immense quantity of bed-furniture, such as canopies, and the like, some of them most richly ornamented with pearl; some royal dresses, so extremely magnificent as to raise any one’s admiration at the sums they must have cost.  We were next led into the Armoury, in which are these particularities:—Spears, out of which you may shoot; shields, that will give fire four times; a great many rich halberds, commonly called partisans, with which the guard defend the royal person in battle; some lances, covered with red and green velvet, and the body-armour of Henry VIII.; many and very beautiful arms, as well for men as for horses in horse-fights; the lance of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, three spans thick; two pieces of cannon, the one fires three, the other seven balls at a time; two others made of wood, which the English has at the siege of Boulogne, in France.   And by this stratagem, without which they could not have succeeded, they struck a terror into the inhabitants, as at the appearance of artillery, and the town was surrendered upon articles; nineteen cannon of a thicker make than ordinary, and in a room apart; thirty-six of a smaller; other cannon for chain-shot; and balls proper to bring down masts of ships. Cross-bows, bows and arrows, of which to this day the English make great use in their exercises; but who can relate all that is to be seen here? Eight or nine men employed by the year are scarce sufficient to keep all the arms bright.  The Mint for coining money is in the Tower.  N.B.—It is to be noted, that when any of the nobility are sent hither, on the charge of high crimes, punishable with death, such as treason, &c., they seldom or never recover their liberty.  Here was beheaded Anne Boleyn, wife of King Henry VIII., and lies buried in the chapel, but without any inscription; and Queen Elizabeth was kept prisoner here by her sister, Queen Mary, at whose death she was enlarged, and by right called to the throne.  On coming out of the Tower, we were led to a small house close by, where are kept variety of creatures, viz.—three lionesses; one lion of great size, called Edward VI. from his having been born in that reign: a tiger; a lynx; a wolf excessively old—this is a very scarce animal in England, so that their sheep and cattle stray about in great numbers, free from any danger, though without anybody to keep them; there is, besides, a porcupine, and an eagle.  All these creatures are kept in a remote place, fitted up for the purpose with wooden lattices, at the Queen’s expense.  Near to this Tower is a large open space; on the highest part of it is erected a wooden scaffold, for the execution of noble criminals; upon which, they say, three princes of England, the last of their families, have been beheaded for high treason; on the bank of the Thames close by are a great many cannon, such chiefly as are used at sea.  The next thing worthy of note is the Royal Exchange, so named by Queen Elizabeth, built by Sir Thomas Gresham, citizen, for public ornament and the convenience of merchants.  It has a great effect, whether you consider the stateliness of the building, the assemblage of different nations, or the quantities of merchandise.  I shall say nothing of the hall belonging to the Hans Society; or of the conveyance of water to all parts of the town by subterraneous pipes, nor the beautiful conduits and cisterns for the reception of it; nor of the raising of water out of the Thames by a wheel, invented a few years since by a German.  Bridewell, at present the House of Correction; it was built in six weeks for the reception of the Emperor Charles V.  A Hall built by a cobbler and bestowed on the city, where are exposed to sale, three times in a week, corn, wool, cloth, fruits, and the like.  Without the city are some theatres, where English actors represent almost every day tragedies and comedies to a very numerous audiences; these are concluded with excellent music, variety of dances, and the excessive applause of those that are present.  Not far from one of these theatres, which are all built of wood, lies the royal barge, close to the river.  It has two splendid cabins, beautifully ornamented with glass windows, painting, and gilding; it is kept upon dry ground, and sheltered from the weather.  There is still another place, built in the form of a theatre, which serves for the baiting of bulls and bears; they are fastened behind, and then worried by great English bull-dogs, but not without great risk to the dogs, from the horns of"]]]
