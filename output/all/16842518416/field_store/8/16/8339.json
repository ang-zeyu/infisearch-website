Will Phaedra, in her frenzy           Accuse herself, and seal her own destruction?           What will the King say? Gods! What fatal poison           Has love spread over all his house! Myself,           Full of a fire his hatred disapproves,           How changed he finds me from the son he knew!           With dark forebodings in my mind alarm'd,           But innocence has surely naught to fear.           Come, let us go, and in some other place           Consider how I best may move my sire           To tenderness, and tell him of a flame           Vex'd but not vanquish'd by a father's blame.     ACT IV            Scene I           THESEUS, OENONE             THESEUS           Ah! What is this I hear? Presumptuous traitor!           And would he have disgraced his father's honour?           With what relentless footsteps Fate pursues me!           Whither I go I know not, nor where know           I am. O kind affection ill repaid!           Audacious scheme! Abominable thought!           To reach the object of his foul desire           The wretch disdain'd not to use violence.           I know this sword that served him in his fury,           The sword I gave him for a nobler use.           Could not the sacred ties of blood restrain him?           And Phaedra,--was she loath to have him punish'd?           She held her tongue. Was that to spare the culprit?            OENONE           Nay, but to spare a most unhappy father.           O'erwhelm'd with shame that her eyes should have kindled           So infamous a flame and prompted him           To crime so heinous, Phaedra would have died.           I saw her raise her arm, and ran to save her.           To me alone you owe it that she lives;           And, in my pity both for her and you,           Have I against my will interpreted           Her tears.            THESEUS           The traitor! He might well turn pale.           'Twas fear that made him tremble when he saw me.           I was astonish'd that he show'd no pleasure;           His frigid greeting chill'd my tenderness.           But was this guilty passion that devours him           Declared already ere I banish'd him           From Athens?            OENONE           Sire, remember how the Queen           Urged you. Illicit love caused all her hatred.            THESEUS           And then this fire broke out again at Troezen?            OENONE           Sire, I have told you all. Too long the Queen           Has been allow'd to bear her grief alone           Let me now leave you and attend to her.              Scene II           THESEUS, HIPPOLYTUS             THESEUS           Ah! There he is. Great gods! That noble mien           Might well deceive an eye less fond than mine!           Why should the sacred stamp of virtue gleam           Upon the forehead of an impious wretch?           Ought not the blackness of a traitor's heart           To show itself by sure and certain signs?            HIPPOLYTUS           My father, may I ask what fatal cloud           Has troubled your majestic countenance?           Dare you not trust this secret to your son?            THESEUS           Traitor, how dare you show yourself before me?           Monster, whom Heaven's bolts have spared too long!           Survivor of that robber crew whereof           I cleansed the earth. After your brutal lust           Scorn'd even to respect my marriage bed,           You venture--you, my hated foe--to come           Into my presence, here, where all is full           Of your foul infamy, instead of seeking           Some unknown land that never heard my name.           Fly, traitor, fly! Stay not to tempt the wrath           That I can scarce restrain, nor brave my hatred.           Disgrace enough have I incurr'd for ever           In being father of so vile a son,           Without your death staining indelibly           The glorious record of my noble deeds.           Fly, and unless you wish quick punishment           To add you to the criminals cut off           By me, take heed this sun that lights us now           Ne'er sees you more set foot upon this soil.           I tell you once again,--fly, haste, return not,           Rid all my realms of your atrocious presence.           To thee, to thee, great Neptune, I appeal           If erst I clear'd thy shores of foul assassins           Recall thy promise to reward those efforts,           Crown'd with success, by granting my first pray'r.           Confined for long in close captivity,           I have not yet call'd on thy pow'rful aid,           Sparing to use the valued privilege           Till at mine utmost need. The time is come           I ask thee now. Avenge a wretched father!           I leave this traitor to thy wrath; in blood           Quench his outrageous fires, and by thy fury           Theseus will estimate thy favour tow'rds him.            HIPPOLYTUS           Phaedra accuses me of lawless passion!           This crowning horror all my soul confounds;           Such unexpected blows, falling at once,           O'erwhelm me, choke my utterance, strike me dumb.            THESEUS           Traitor, you reckon'd that in timid silence           Phaedra would bury your brutality.           You should not have abandon'd in your flight           The sword that in her hands helps to condemn you;           Or rather, to complete your perfidy,           You should have robb'd her both of speech and life.            HIPPOLYTUS           Justly indignant at a lie so black           I might be pardon'd if I told the truth;           But it concerns your honour to conceal it.           Approve the reverence that shuts my mouth;           And, without wishing to increase your woes,           Examine closely what my life has been.           Great crimes are never single, they are link'd           To former faults. He who has once transgress'd           May violate at last all that men hold           Most sacred; vice, like virtue, has degrees           Of progress; innocence was never seen           To sink at once into the lowest depths           Of guilt. No virtuous man can in a day           Turn traitor, murderer, an incestuous wretch.           The nursling of a chaste, heroic mother,           I have not proved unworthy of my birth.           Pittheus, whose wisdom is by all esteem'd,           Deign'd to instruct me when I left her hands.           It is no wish of mine to vaunt my merits,           But, if I may lay claim to any virtue,           I think beyond all else I have display'd           Abhorrence of those sins with which I'm charged.           For this Hippolytus is known in Greece,           So continent that he is deem'd austere.           All know my abstinence inflexible:           The daylight is not purer than my heart.           How, then, could I, burning with fire profane--            THESEUS           Yes, dastard, 'tis that very pride condemns you.           I see the odious reason of your coldness           Phaedra alone bewitch'd your shameless eyes;           Your soul, to others' charms indifferent,           Disdain'd the blameless fires of lawful love.            HIPPOLYTUS           No, father, I have hidden it too long,           This heart has not disdain'd a sacred flame.           Here at your feet I own my real offence:           I love, and love in truth where you forbid me;           Bound to Aricia by my heart's devotion,           The child of Pallas has subdued your son.           A rebel to your laws, her I adore,           And breathe forth ardent sighs for her alone.            THESEUS           You love her? Heav'ns!           But no, I see the trick.           You feign a crime to justify yourself.            HIPPOLYTUS           Sir, I have shunn'd her for six months, and still           Love her. To you yourself I came to tell it,           Trembling the while. Can nothing clear your mind           Of your mistake? What oath can reassure you?           By heav'n and earth and all the pow'rs of nature--            THESEUS           The wicked never shrink from perjury.           Cease, cease, and spare me irksome protestations,           If your false virtue has no other aid.            HIPPOLYTUS           Tho' it to you seem false and insincere,           Phaedra has secret cause to know it true.            THESEUS           Ah! how your shamelessness excites my wrath!            HIPPOLYTUS           What is my term and place of banishment?            THESEUS           Were you beyond the Pillars of Alcides,           Your perjured presence were too near me yet.            HIPPOLYTUS           What friends will pity me, when you forsake           And think me guilty of a crime so vile?            THESEUS           Go, look you out for friends who hold in honour           Adultery and clap their hands at incest,           Low, lawless traitors, steep'd in infamy,           The fit protectors of a knave like you.            HIPPOLYTUS           Are incest and adultery the words           You cast at me? I hold my tongue. Yet think           What mother Phaedra had; too well you know           Her blood, not mine, is tainted with those horrors.            THESEUS           What! Does your rage before my eyes lose all           Restraint? For the last time,--out of my sight!           Hence, traitor! Wait not till a father's wrath           Force thee away 'mid general execration.              Scene III             THESEUS (alone)           Wretch! Thou must meet inevitable ruin.           Neptune has sworn by Styx--to gods themselves           A dreadful oath,--and he will execute           His promise. Thou canst not escape his vengeance.           I loved thee; and, in spite of thine offence,           My heart is troubled by anticipation           For thee. But "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1977"],["title","Phaedra (#7)"],["body","hast earn'd thy doom too well.           Had father ever greater cause for rage?           Just gods, who see the grief that overwhelms me,           Why was I cursed with such a wicked son?              SCENE IV           PHAEDRA, THESEUS             PHAEDRA           My lord, I come to you, fill'd with just dread.           Your voice raised high in anger reach'd mine ears,           And much I fear that deeds have follow'd threats.           Oh, if there yet is time, spare your own offspring.           Respect your race and blood, I do beseech you.           Let me not hear that blood cry from the ground;           Save me the horror and perpetual pain           Of having caused his father's hand to shed it.            THESEUS           No, Madam, from that stain my hand is free.           But, for all that, the wretch has not escaped me.           The hand of an Immortal now is charged           With his destruction. 'Tis a debt that Neptune           Owes me, and you shall be avenged.            PHAEDRA           A debt           Owed you? Pray'rs made in anger--            THESEUS           Never fear           That they will fail. Rather join yours to mine           In all their blackness paint for me his crimes,           And fan my tardy passion to white heat.           But yet you know not all his infamy;           His rage against you overflows in slanders;           Your mouth, he says, is full of all deceit,           He says Aricia has his heart and soul,           That her alone he loves.            PHAEDRA           Aricia?            THESEUS           Aye,           He said it to my face! an idle pretext!           A trick that gulls me not! Let us hope Neptune           Will do him speedy justice. To his altars           I go, to urge performance of his oaths.              SCENE V             PHAEDRA (alone)           Ah, he is gone! What tidings struck mine ears?           What fire, half smother'd, in my heart revives?           What fatal stroke falls like a thunderbolt?           Stung by remorse that would not let me rest,           I tore myself out of Oenone's arms,           And flew to help Hippolytus with all           My soul and strength. Who knows if that repentance           Might not have moved me to accuse myself?           And, if my voice had not been choked with shame,           Perhaps I had confess'd the frightful truth.           Hippolytus can feel, but not for me!           Aricia has his heart, his plighted troth.           Ye gods, when, deaf to all my sighs and tears,           He arm'd his eye with scorn, his brow with threats,           I deem'd his heart, impregnable to love,           Was fortified 'gainst all my sex alike.           And yet another has prevail'd to tame           His pride, another has secured his favour.           Perhaps he has a heart easily melted;           I am the only one he cannot bear!           And shall I charge myself with his defence?              SCENE VI           PHAEDRA, OENONE             PHAEDRA           Know you, dear Nurse, what I have learn'd just now?            OENONE           No; but I come in truth with trembling limbs.           I dreaded with what purpose you went forth,           The fear of fatal madness made me pale.            PHAEDRA           Who would have thought it, Nurse? I had a rival.            OENONE           A rival?            PHAEDRA           Yes, he loves. I cannot doubt it.           This wild untamable Hippolytus,           Who scorn'd to be admired, whom lovers' sighs           Wearied, this tiger, whom I fear'd to rouse,           Fawns on a hand that has subdued his pride:           Aricia has found entrance to his heart.            OENONE           Aricia?            PHAEDRA           Ah! anguish as yet untried!           For what new tortures am I still reserved?           All I have undergone, transports of passion,           Longings and fears, the horrors of remorse,           The shame of being spurn'd with contumely,           Were feeble foretastes of my present torments.           They love each other! By what secret charm           Have they deceived me? Where, and when, and how           Met they? You knew it all. Why was I cozen'd?           You never told me of those stolen hours           Of amorous converse. Have they oft been seen           Talking together? Did they seek the shades           Of thickest woods? Alas! full freedom had they           To see each other. Heav'n approved their sighs;           They loved without the consciousness of guilt;           And every morning's sun for them shone clear,           While I, an outcast from the face of Nature,           Shunn'd the bright day, and sought to hide myself.           Death was the only god whose aid I dared           To ask: I waited for the grave's release.           Water'd with tears, nourish'd with gall, my woe           Was all too closely watch'd; I did not dare           To weep without restraint. In mortal dread           Tasting this dangerous solace, I disguised           My terror 'neath a tranquil countenance,           And oft had I to check my tears, and smile.            OENONE           What fruit will they enjoy of their vain love?           They will not see each other more.            PHAEDRA           That love           Will last for ever. Even while I speak,           Ah, fatal thought, they laugh to scorn the madness           Of my distracted heart. In spite of exile           That soon must part them, with a thousand oaths           They seal yet closer union. Can I suffer           A happiness, Oenone, which insults me?           I crave your pity. She must be destroy'd.           My husband's wrath against a hateful stock           Shall be revived, nor must the punishment           Be light: the sister's guilt passes the brothers'.           I will entreat him in my jealous rage.           What am I saying? Have I lost my senses?           Is Phaedra jealous, and will she implore           Theseus for help? My husband lives, and yet           I burn. For whom? Whose heart is this I claim           As mine? At every word I say, my hair           Stands up with horror. Guilt henceforth has pass'd           All bounds. Hypocrisy and incest breathe           At once thro' all. My murderous hands are ready           To spill the blood of guileless innocence.           Do I yet live, wretch that I am, and dare           To face this holy Sun from whom I spring?           My father's sire was king of all the gods;           My ancestors fill all the universe.           Where can I hide? In the dark realms of Pluto?           But there my father holds the fatal urn;           His hand awards th' irrevocable doom:           Minos is judge of all the ghosts in hell.           Ah! how his awful shade will start and shudder           When he shall see his daughter brought before him,           Forced to confess sins of such varied dye,           Crimes it may be unknown to hell itself!           What wilt thou say, my father, at a sight           So dire? I think I see thee drop the urn,           And, seeking some unheard-of punishment,           Thyself become my executioner.           Spare me! A cruel goddess has destroy'd           Thy race; and in my madness recognize           Her wrath. Alas! My aching heart has reap'd           No fruit of pleasure from the frightful crime           The shame of which pursues me to the grave,           And ends in torment life-long misery.            OENONE           Ah, Madam, pray dismiss a groundless dread:           Look less severely on a venial error.           You love. We cannot conquer destiny.           You were drawn on as by a fatal charm.           Is that a marvel without precedent           Among us? Has love triumph'd over you,           And o'er none else? Weakness is natural           To man. A mortal, to a mortal's lot           Submit. You chafe against a yoke that others           Have long since borne. The dwellers in Olympus,           The gods themselves, who terrify with threats           The sins of men, have burn'd with lawless fires.            PHAEDRA           What words are these I hear? What counsel this           You dare to give me? Will you to the end           Pour poison in mine ears? You have destroy'd me.           You brought me back when I should else have quitted           The light of day, made me forget my duty           And see Hippolytus, till then avoided.           What hast thou done? Why did your wicked mouth           With blackest lies slander his blameless life?           Perhaps you've slain him, and the impious pray'r           Of an unfeeling father has been answer'd.           No, not another word! Go, hateful monster;           Away, and leave me to my piteous fate.           May Heav'n with justice pay you your deserts!           And may your punishment for ever be           A terror to all those who would, like you,           Nourish with artful wiles the weaknesses           Of princes, push them to the brink of ruin           To which their heart inclines, and smooth the path           Of guilt. Such flatterers doth the wrath of Heav'n           Bestow on kings as its most fatal gift.            OENONE (alone)           O gods! to serve her what have I not done?
