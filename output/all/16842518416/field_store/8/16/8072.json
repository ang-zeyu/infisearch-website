A _major diatonic scale_ is one in which the intervals between the tones are arranged as follows:  1  whole  2  whole  3  half  4  whole  5  whole  6  whole  7  half  8    step      step      step     step      step      step      step  In other words, a major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals between three and four, and between seven and eight are half-steps, all the others being whole-steps. A composition based on this scale is said to be written in the major mode, or in a major key. The major diatonic scale may begin on any one of the twelve pitches C, C[sharp] or D[flat], D, D[sharp] or E[flat], E, F, F[sharp] or G[flat], G, G[sharp] or A[flat], A, A[sharp] or B[flat], B, but in each case it is the same scale because the intervals between its tones are the same. We have then one major scale only, but this scale may be written in many different positions, and may be sung or played beginning on any one of a number of different pitches.  82. It is interesting to note that the major scale consists of two identical series of four tones each; _i.e._, the first four tones of the scale are separated from one another by exactly the same intervals and these intervals appear in exactly the same order as in the case of the last four tones of the scale. Fig. 53 will make this clear. The first four tones of any diatonic scale (major or minor) are often referred to as the _lower tetrachord_[14] and the upper four tones as the _upper tetrachord_.  [Footnote 14: The word _tetrachord_ means literally \"four strings\" and refers to the primitive instrument, the four strings of which were so tuned that the lowest and the highest tones produced were a perfect fourth apart. With the Greeks the tetrachord was the unit of analysis as the octave is with us to-day, and all Greek scales are capable of division into two tetrachords, the arrangement of the intervals between the tones in each tetrachord differentiating one scale from another, but the tetrachords themselves always consisting of groups of four tones, the highest being a perfect fourth above the lowest.]  [Illustration: Fig. 53.]  It is interesting further to note that the upper tetrachord of any _sharp_ scale is always used without change as the lower tetrachord of the next major scale involving sharps, while the lower tetrachord of any _flat_ scale is used as the upper tetrachord of the next flat scale. See Figs. 54 and 55.  [Illustration: Fig. 54.]  [Illustration: Fig. 55.]  83. From the standpoint of staff notation the major scale may be written in fifteen different positions, as follows:  [Illustration]  It will be observed that in the above series of scales those beginning on F[sharp] and G[flat] call for the same keys on the piano, _i.e._, while the notation is different, the actual tones of the scale are the same. The scales of C[sharp] and D[flat] likewise employ the same tones. When two scales thus employ the same tones but differ in notation they are said to be _enharmonic_, (cf. p. 38, Sec. 93.)       _Note_.--The student is advised to adopt some uniform method      of writing scales, preferably the one followed in those given      above, the necessary sharps and flats appearing before the      notes in the scale and then repeated collectively at the end      as a signature. He is also advised to repeat these scales and      signatures over and over until absolute familiarity is      attained. _E.g._, E--F[sharp]--G[sharp]--A--B--C[sharp]--D[sharp]--E;      signature, four sharps, F, C, G, and D.     CHAPTER VIII  SCALES (_Continued_)   84. The _minor diatonic scale_ is used in several slightly different forms, but the characteristic interval between the first and third tones (which differentiates it from the major scale) remains the same in every case. This interval between the first and third tones consists of four half-steps in the major scale and of three half-steps in the minor scale and this difference in size has given rise to the designation _major_ for the scale having the larger third, and _minor_ for the scale having the smaller one.  85. _The original (or primitive) form_ of the minor scale has its tones arranged as follows.  1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  half  5  half  6  whole  7  whole  8    step      step     step      step     step     step      step  As its name implies, this is the oldest of the three forms (being derived from the old Greek Aeolian scale), but because of the absence of a \"leading tone\" it is suitable for the simplest one-part music only, and is therefore little used at present.  86. _The harmonic minor scale_ is like the primitive form except that it substitutes a tone one half-step higher for the seventh tone of the older (_i.e._, the primitive) form. This change was made because the development of writing music in several parts (particularly _harmonic_ part-writing) made necessary a \"leading tone,\" _i.e._, a tone with a strong tendency to move on up to the key-tone as a closing point. In order to secure a tone with such a strongly upward tendency the interval between _seven_ and _eight_ had to be reduced in size to a half-step. It should be noted that this change in the seventh tone of the scale caused an interval of a step-and-a-half between the sixth and seventh tones of the scale.  1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  whole  5  half  6  step and  7  half 8    step      step     step      step      step      a half      step  87. _The melodic minor scale_ substitutes a tone one half-step higher than six as well as one a half-step higher than seven, but this change is made in the ascending scale only, the descending scale being like the primitive form. The higher sixth (commonly referred to as the \"raised sixth\") was used to get rid of the unmelodic interval of a step-and-a-half[15] (augmented second), while the return to the primitive form in descending is made because the ascending form is too much like the tonic major scale.  [Footnote 15: The step-and-a-half (augmented second) is \"unmelodic\" because it is the same size as a _minor third_ and the mind finds it difficult to take in as a _second_ (notes representing it being on adjacent staff-degrees) an interval of the same size as a third.]  1  whole  2  half  3  whole  4  whole  5  whole  6  whole  7  half  8    step      step     step      step      step      step      step            7  whole  6  half  5  whole  4  whole  3  half  2  whole  1              step      step     step      step      step     step  This form is used only to a very limited extent, and then principally in vocal music, the harmonic form being in almost universal use in spite of the augmented second.  88. The minor scale in its various positions (up to five sharps and five flats) and in all three forms follows: a composition based on any one of these forms (or upon a mixture of them, which often occurs) is said to be _in the minor mode_. It will be noted that the first four tones are alike in all three forms; _i.e._, the lower tetrachord in the minor scale is invariable no matter, what may happen to the upper tetrachord. The sign + marks the step-and-a-half.  [Illustration]       _Note._--The student is advised to recite the _harmonic form_      of the minor scale as was suggested in the case of the major      scale, noting that the \"raised seventh\" does not affect the      key-signature. _E.g._,--E--F[sharp]--G--A--B--C--D[sharp]--E;      signature, one sharp, F.  89. A minor scale having the same signature as a major scale is said to be its _relative minor_. _E.g._,--e is the relative minor of G, c of E[flat], d of F, etc., the small letter being used to refer to the minor key or scale, while the capital letter indicates the major key or scale unless accompanied by the word _minor_. Relative keys are therefore defined as those having the same signature. G and e are relative keys, as are also A and f[sharp], etc.  90. A minor scale beginning with the same tone as a major scale is referred to as its _tonic minor_. Thus, _e.g._, c with three flats in its signature is the tonic minor of C with all degrees in natural condition; e with one sharp is the tonic minor of E with four sharps, etc. Tonic keys are therefore those having the same key-tone.  91. The eight tones of the diatonic scale (both major and minor) are often referred to by specific names, as follows:       1. _Tonic_--the tone. (This refers to the fact that the tonic      is the principal tone, or generating tone of the key, _i.e._,      it is _the_ tone.)       2. _Super-tonic_--above the tone.       3. _Mediant_--midway between tonic and dominant.       4. _Sub-dominant_--the under dominant. (This name does not      refer to the position of the tone under the dominant but to      the fact that the fifth below the tonic is also a dominant      tone--the under dominant--just as the fifth above is the upper      dominant).       5. _Dominant_--the governing tone. (From the Latin word      _dominus_ meaning _master_.)       6. _Super-dominant_--above the dominant. Or      _Sub-mediant_--midway between tonic and sub-dominant.       7. _Leading tone_--the tone which demands resolution to the      tonic (one-half step above it).       8. _Octave_--the eighth tone.  92. The syllables commonly applied to the various major and minor scales in teaching sight-singing are as follows:[16]  [Footnote 16: These syllables are said to have been derived originally from the initial syllables of the \"Hymn to Saint John,\" the music of which was a typical Gregorian chant. The application of these syllables to the scale tones will be made clear by reference to this hymn as given below. It will be observed that this hymn provided syllables only for the six tones of the _hexachord_ then recognized; when the octave scale was adopted (early in the sixteenth century) the initial letters of the last line (s and i) were combined into a syllable for the seventh tone.

Minor[17]--original--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA.            harmonic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SI, LA.            melodic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FI, SI, LA,              SOL, FA, MI, RE, DO, TI, LA.  [Footnote 17: A considerable number of teachers (particularly those who did not learn to sing by syllable in childhood) object to calling the tonic of the minor scale _la_, insisting that both major and minor tonic should be called _do_. According to this plan the syllables used in singing the harmonic minor scale would be: DO, RE, ME, FA, SOL, LE, TI, DO.  There is no particular basis for this theory, for although all scales must of course begin with the key-tone or tonic, this tonic may be referred to by any syllable which will serve as a basis for an association process enabling one to feel the force of the tone as a closing point--a _home tone_. Thus in the Dorian mode the tonic would be RE, in the Phrygian, MI, etc.]       It is interesting to study the changes in both spelling and      pronunciation that have occurred (and are still occurring) in      these syllables. The first one (ut) was changed to _DO_ as      early as the sixteenth century because of the difficulty of      producing a good singing tone on _ut_. For the same reason and      also in order to avoid having two diatonic syllables with the      same initial letter, the tonic-sol-fa system (invented in      England about 1812 and systematized about 1850) changed SI to      TI and this change has been almost universally adopted by      teachers of sight-singing in this country. The more elaborate      tonic-sol-fa spelling of the diatonic syllables (DOH, LAH,      etc.), has not, however, been favorably received in this      country and the tendency seems to be toward still further      simplification rather than toward elaboration. It is probable      that further changes in both spelling and pronunciation will      be made in the near future, one such change that seems      especially desirable being some other syllable than RE for the      second tone of the major scale, so that the present syllable      may be reserved for \"flat-two,\" thus providing a uniform      vowel-sound for all intermediate tones of the descending      chromatic scale, as is already the case in the ascending form.  93. The _chromatic scale_[18] is one which proceeds always by half-steps. Its intervals are therefore always equal no matter with what tone it begins. Since, however, we have (from the standpoint of the piano keyboard) five pairs of tones[19] which are enharmonically the same, it may readily be seen that the chromatic scale might be notated in all sorts of fashions, and this is in fact the real status of the matter, there being no one method uniformly agreed upon by composers.  [Footnote 18: The student should differentiate between the so-called \"tonality\" scales like the major and minor, the tones of which are actually used as a basis for \"key-feeling\" with the familiar experience of coming home to the tonic after a melodic or harmonic excursion, and on the other hand the purely artificial and mechanical construction of the chromatic scale.]  [Footnote 19: Many other enharmonic notations are possible, altho the \"five pairs of tones\" above referred to are the most common. Thus E[sharp] and F are enharmonically the same, as are also C[flat] and B, C[sharp] and B[double-sharp], etc.]       Parry (Grove's Dictionary, article _chromatic_) recommends      writing the scale with such accidentals as can occur in      chromatic chords without changing the key in which the passage      occurs. Thus, taking C as a type, \"the first accidental will      be D[flat], as the upper note of the minor ninth on the tonic;      the next will be E[flat], the minor third of the key; the next      F[sharp], the major third of the super-tonic--all of which can      occur without causing modulation--and the remaining two will      be A[flat] and B[flat], the minor sixth and seventh of the      key.\" According to this plan the chromatic scale beginning      with C would be spelled--C, D[flat], D, E[flat], E, F,      F[sharp], G, A[flat], A, B[flat], B, C--the form being the      same both ascending and descending. This is of course written      exclusively from a harmonic standpoint and the advantage of      such a form is its definiteness.  94. For _sight-singing purposes_ the chromatic scale[20] is usually written by representing the intermediate tones in ascending by sharps, (in some cases naturals and double-sharps), and the intermediate tones in descending by flats (sometimes naturals and double-flats). The chromatic scale in nine different positions, written from this standpoint, follows, and the syllables most commonly applied in sight-singing have also been added. In the first two scales the student of harmony is asked to note that because of the very common practice of modulating to the dominant and sub-dominant keys, the intermediate tones [sharp]4 and [flat]7 are quite universally used in both ascending and descending melody passages. In other words the scales that follow would more nearly represent actual usage if in each case [sharp]4 (FI) were substituted for [flat]5 (SE) in the descending scale; and if [flat]7 (TE) were substituted for [sharp]6 (LI) in the ascending form.  [Footnote 20: The word _chromatic_ means literally _colored_ and was first applied to the intermediate tones because by using them the singer could get smoother and more diversely-shaded progressions, _i.e._, could get more _color_ than by using only the diatonic tones. Composers were not long discovering the peculiar value of these additional tones and soon found that these same tones were exceedingly valuable also in modulating, hence the two uses of intermediate tones at the present time--first, to embellish a melody; second, to modulate to another key.]  [Illustration]       _Note._--In writing chromatic scales from this sight-singing      standpoint the student is urged to adopt a three-step process;      first, writing the major diatonic scale both ascending and      descending; second, marking the half-steps; third, inserting      accidental notes calling for the intermediate tones. In the      above chromatic scales these intermediate tones have been      represented by black note-heads so as to differentiate them      from the notes representing diatonic scale tones.  95. The _whole-step scale_ (the third type mentioned in Sec. 79) is, as its name implies, a scale in which the intervals between the tones consist in every instance of whole-steps. This reduces the number of tones in the scale to seven. Beginning with C the scale reads: C, D, E, F[sharp] or G[flat], A[flat], B[flat], C. This scale has been used somewhat extensively by the ultramodern French school of composition represented by Debussy, Ravel, and others, but is not making any progress toward universal adoption. The remarks of a recent English writer[21] on this subject may be interesting to the student who is puzzled by the apparent present-day tendencies of French music. He says:       \"The student of some interesting modern developments will also      speedily discover that the adoption of the so-called      whole-tone scale as a basis of music is, except upon a keyed      instrument tuned to the compromise of equal temperament,      unnatural and impossible. No player upon a stringed instrument      can play the scale of whole-tones and arrive at an octave      which is in tune with the starting note, unless he      deliberately changes one of the notes on the road and alters      it while playing it. The obvious result of the application of      the whole-tone scale to an orchestra or a string quartet would      be to force them to adopt the equal temperament of the      pianoforte, and play every interval except the octave out of      tune. When this modification had taken hold all music in the      pure scale would be distorted and destroyed, unless string      players were to face the practically impossible drudgery of      studying both the equal temperament and the pure scale from      the start, and were able to tackle either form at a moment's      notice. A thorough knowledge of the natural genesis of the      scale of western nations will be the best antidote to fads      founded upon ignorance of it. It is a curious commentary upon      this question that Wagner, in the opening of the third act of      _Tristan_ (bars 6 to 10), experimented with the whole-tone      scale and drew his pen through it, as was to be expected from      a composer whose every work proves the writer to have had the      pure scale inbred in him.\"  [Footnote 21: Stanford--Musical Composition (1911) p. 17.]  There may be some difference of opinion among acousticians as to whether Mr. Stanford is correct in his scientific assumptions regarding the difference between \"tempered\" and \"pure\" scales,[22] but even so, there is a far more potent reason why the whole-step scale will probably never become popular as the major and minor scales now are, viz., the fact that it offers no possibility of _inculcating tonality feeling_, which has always been the basis of even the simplest primitive music. Tonality scales give rise to a feeling of alternate periods of contraction and relaxation--an active tone (or chord) followed by a passive one, but no such effect is possible in the whole-step scale, and it seems suitable therefore only for that class of music whose outlines are _purposely intended to be_ vague and indefinite--the impressionistic style of music writing.  [Footnote 22: Recent tests in Germany seem to prove conclusively that the _tempered_ scale is the scale ordinarily employed by both vocalists and players on stringed instruments, and that"]]]
