In all this populous and intricate world of anguish, though he found none to worship, he found many to help. He fed the hungry, and clothed the naked, and healed the sick, and comforted the captive; and his years went by more swiftly than the weaver's shuttle that flashes back and forth through the loom while the web grows and the invisible pattern is completed.  [Illustration - \"He healed the sick\"]  It seemed almost as if he had forgotten his quest. But once I saw him for a moment as he stood alone at sunrise, waiting at the gate of a Roman prison. He had taken from a secret resting-place in his bosom the pearl, the last of his jewels. As he looked at it, a mellower lustre, a soft and iridescent light, full of shifting gleams of azure and rose, trembled upon its surface. It seemed to have absorbed some reflection of the colors of the lost sapphire and ruby. So the profound, secret purpose of a noble life draws into itself the memories of past joy and past sorrow. All that has helped it, all that has hindered it, is transfused by a subtle magic into its very essence. It becomes more luminous and precious the longer it is carried close to the warmth of the beating heart.  Then, at last, while I was thinking of this pearl, and of its meaning, I heard the end of the story of the Other Wise Man.    A PEARL OF GREAT PRICE   Three-and-thirty years of the life of Artaban had passed away, and he was still a pilgrim, and a seeker after light. His hair, once darker than the cliffs of Zagros, was now white as the wintry snow that covered them. His eyes, that once flashed like flames of fire, were dull as embers smouldering among the ashes.  Worn and weary and ready to die, but still looking for the King, he had come for the last time to Jerusalem. He had often visited the holy city before, and had searched through all its lanes and crowded hovels and black prisons without finding any trace of the family of Nazarenes who had fled from Bethlehem long ago. But now it seemed as if he must make one more effort, and something whispered in his heart that, at last, he might succeed.  It was the season of the Passover. The city was thronged with strangers. The children of Israel, scattered in far lands all over the world, had returned to the Temple for the great feast, and there had been a confusion of tongues in the narrow streets for many days.  But on this day there was a singular agitation visible in the multitude. The sky was veiled with a portentous gloom, and currents of excitement seemed to flash through the crowd like the thrill which shakes the forest on the eve of a storm. A secret tide was sweeping them all one way. The clatter of sandals, and the soft, thick sound of thousands of bare feet shuffling over the stones, flowed unceasingly along the street that leads to the Damascus gate.  Artaban joined company with a group of people from his own country, Parthian Jews who had come up to keep the Passover, and inquired of them the cause of the tumult, and where they were going.  \"We are going,\" they answered, \"to the place called Golgotha, outside the city walls, where there is to be an execution. Have you not heard what has happened? Two famous robbers are to be crucified, and with them another, called Jesus of Nazareth, a man who has done many wonderful works among the people, so that they love him greatly. But the priests and elders have said that he must die, because he gave himself out to be the Son of God. And Pilate has sent him to the cross because he said that he was the 'King of the Jews.'\"  How strangely these familiar words fell upon the tired heart of Artaban! They had led him for a lifetime over land and sea. And now they came to him darkly and mysteriously like a message of despair. The King had arisen, but He had been denied and cast out. He was about to perish. Perhaps He was already dying. Could it be the same who had been born in Bethlehem thirty-three years ago, at whose birth the star had appeared in heaven, and of whose coming the prophets had spoken?  Artaban's heart beat unsteadily with that troubled, doubtful apprehension which is the excitement of old age. But he said within himself: \"The ways of God are stranger than the thoughts of men, and it may be that I shall find the King, at last, in the hands of His enemies, and shall come in time to offer my pearl for His ransom before He dies.\"  So the old man followed the multitude with slow and painful steps towards the Damascus gate of the city. Just beyond the entrance of the guard-house a troop of Macedonian soldiers came down the street, dragging a young girl with torn dress and dishevelled hair. As the Magian paused to look at her with compassion, she broke suddenly from the hands of her tormentors, and threw herself at his feet, clasping him around the knees. She had seen his white cap and the winged circle on his breast.  [Illustration - \"The old man followed the multitude\"]  \"Have pity on me,\" she cried, \"and save me, for the sake of the God of Purity! I also am a daughter of the true religion which is taught by the Magi. My father was a merchant of Parthia, but he is dead, and I am seized for his debts to be sold as a slave. Save me from worse than death.\"  Artaban trembled.  It was the old conflict in his soul, which had come to him in the palm-grove of Babylon and in the cottage at Bethlehem--the conflict between the expectation of faith and the impulse of love. Twice the gift which he had consecrated to the worship of religion had been drawn from his hand to the service of humanity. This was the third trial, the ultimate probation, the final and irrevocable choice.  Was it his great opportunity, or his last temptation? He could not tell. One thing only was clear in the darkness of his mind--it was inevitable. And does not the inevitable come from God?  One thing only was sure to his divided heart--to rescue this helpless girl would be a true deed of love. And is not love the light of the soul?  He took the pearl from his bosom. Never had it seemed so luminous, so radiant, so full of tender, living lustre. He laid it in the hand of the slave.  \"This is thy ransom, daughter! It is the last of my treasures which I kept for the King.\"  While he spoke, the darkness of the sky thickened, and shuddering tremors ran through the earth, heaving convulsively like the breast of one who struggles with mighty grief.  The walls of the houses rocked to and fro. Stones were loosened and crashed into the street. Dust clouds filled the air. The soldiers fled in terror, reeling like drunken men. But Artaban and the girl whom he had ransomed crouched helpless beneath the wall of the Praetorium.  What had he to fear? What had he to live for? He had given away the last remnant of his tribute for the King. He had parted with the last hope of finding Him. The quest was over, and it had failed. But, even in that thought, accepted and embraced, there was peace. It was not resignation. It was not submission. It was something more profound and searching. He knew that all was well, because he had done the best that he could, from day to day. He had been true to the light that had been given to him. He had looked for more. And if he had not found it, if a failure was all that came out of his life, doubtless that was the best that was possible. He had not seen the revelation of \"life everlasting, incorruptible and immortal.\" But he knew that even if he could live his earthly life over again, it could not be otherwise than it had been.  One more lingering pulsation of the earthquake quivered through the ground. A heavy tile, shaken from the roof, fell and struck the old man on the temple. He lay breathless and pale, with his gray head resting on the young girl's shoulder, and the blood trickling from the wound. As she bent over him, fearing that he was dead, there came a voice through the twilight, very small and still, like music sounding from a distance, in which the notes are clear but the words are lost. The girl turned to see if some one had spoken from the window above them, but she saw no one.  Then the old man's lips began to move, as if in answer, and she heard him say in the Parthian tongue:  \"Not so, my Lord: For when saw I thee an hungered and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw I thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? When saw I thee sick or in prison, and came unto thee? Three-and-thirty years have I looked for thee; but I have never seen thy face, nor ministered to thee, my King.\"  He ceased, and the sweet voice came again. And again the maid heard it, very faintly and far away. But now it seemed as though she understood the words:  \"_Verily I say unto thee, Inasmuch as thou hast done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, thou hast done it unto me._\"  A calm radiance of wonder and joy lighted the pale face of Artaban like the first ray of dawn on a snowy mountain-peak. One long, last breath of relief exhaled gently from his lips.  His journey was ended. His treasures were accepted. The Other Wise Man had found the King.

The fancy for them has even penetrated into the country.  I am acquainted with a man there who denies himself necessaries, for the sake of collecting into a library (where other books are scarce enough) as many little Elzevirs as he can lay his hands upon.  He is dying of hunger, and his consolation is to be able to say, ‘I have all the poets whom the Elzevirs printed.  I have ten examples of each of them, all with red letters, and all of the right date.’  This, no doubt, is a craze, for, good as the books are, if he kept them to read them, one example of each would be enough.”  _The Parisian_.  “If he had wanted to read them, I would not have advised him to buy Elzevirs.  The editions of minor authors which these booksellers published, even editions ‘of the right date,’ as you say, are not too correct.  Nothing is good in the books but the type and the paper.  Your friend would have done better to use the editions of Gryphius or Estienne.”  This fragment of a literary dialogue I translate from ‘Entretiens sur les Contes de Fées,’ a book which contains more of old talk about books and booksellers than about fairies and folk-lore.  The ‘Entretiens’ were published in 1699, about sixteen years after the Elzevirs ceased to be publishers.  The fragment is valuable: first, because it shows us how early the taste for collecting Elzevirs was fully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very sound criticism of the mania. Already, in the seventeenth century, lovers of the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates, already they knew that a ‘Cæsar’ of 1635 was the right ‘Cæsar,’ already they were fond of the red-lettered passages, as in the first edition of the ‘Virgil’ of 1636.  As early as 1699, too, the Parisian critic knew that the editions were not very correct, and that the paper, type, ornaments, and _format_ were their main attractions.  To these we must now add the rarity of really good Elzevirs.  Though Elzevirs have been more fashionable than at present, they are still regarded by novelists as the great prize of the book collector. You read in novels about “priceless little Elzevirs,” about books “as rare as an old Elzevir.”  I have met, in the works of a lady novelist (but not elsewhere), with an Elzevir ‘Theocritus.’  The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon introduced into one of his romances a romantic Elzevir Greek Testament, “worth its weight in gold.”  Casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion that all Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price.  When a man is first smitten with the pleasant fever of book-collecting, it is for Elzevirs that he searches.  At first he thinks himself in amazing luck.  In Booksellers’ Row and in Castle Street he “picks up,” for a shilling or two, Elzevirs, real or supposed.  To the beginner, any book with a sphere on the title-page is an Elzevir.  For the beginner’s instruction, two copies of spheres are printed here.  The second is a sphere, an ill-cut, ill-drawn sphere, which is not Elzevirian at all.  The mark was used in the seventeenth century by many other booksellers and printers.  The first, on the other hand, is a true Elzevirian sphere, from a play of Molière’s, printed in 1675.  Observe the comparatively neat drawing of the first sphere, and be not led away after spurious imitations.                          [Picture: Elzevir Spheres]  Beware, too, of the vulgar error of fancying that little duodecimos with the mark of the fox and the bee’s nest, and the motto “Quaerendo,” come from the press of the Elzevirs.  The mark is that of Abraham Wolfgang, which name is not a pseudonym for Elzevir.  There are three sorts of Elzevir pseudonyms.  First, they occasionally reprinted the full title-page, publisher’s name and all, of the book they pirated. Secondly, when they printed books of a “dangerous” sort, Jansenist pamphlets and so forth, they used pseudonyms like “Nic. Schouter,” on the ‘Lettres Provinciales’ of Pascal.  Thirdly, there are real pseudonyms employed by the Elzevirs.  John and Daniel, printing at Leyden (1652–1655), used the false name “Jean Sambix.”  The Elzevirs of Amsterdam often placed the name “Jacques le Jeune” on their title-pages. The collector who remembers these things must also see that his purchases have the right ornaments at the heads of chapters, the right tail-pieces at the ends.  Two of the most frequently recurring ornaments are the so-called “Tête de Buffle” and the “Sirène.”  More or less clumsy copies of these and the other Elzevirian ornaments are common enough in books of the period, even among those printed out of the Low Countries; for example, in books published in Paris.  A brief sketch of the history of the Elzevirs may here be useful.  The founder of the family, a Flemish bookbinder, Louis, left Louvain and settled in Leyden in 1580.  He bought a house opposite the University, and opened a book-shop.  Another shop, on college ground, was opened in 1587.  Louis was a good bookseller, a very ordinary publisher.  It was not till shortly before his death, in 1617, that his grandson Isaac bought a set of types and other material.  Louis left six sons.  Two of these, Matthew and Bonaventure, kept on the business, dating _ex officina Elzeviriana_.  In 1625 Bonaventure and Abraham (son of Matthew) became partners.  The “good dates” of Elzevirian books begin from 1626.  The two Elzevirs chose excellent types, and after nine years’ endeavours turned out the beautiful ‘Cæsar’ of 1635.  Their classical series in _petit format_ was opened "]]]
