It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!  I don’t want to go outside. I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.  For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.  But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.  Why, there’s John at the door!  It is no use, young man, you can’t open it!  How he does call and pound!  Now he’s crying for an axe.  It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!  “John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice, “the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!”  That silenced him for a few moments.  Then he said—very quietly indeed, “Open the door, my darling!”  “I can’t,” said I. “The key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf!”  And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door.  “What is the matter?” he cried. “For God’s sake, what are you doing!”  I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.  “I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve pulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!”  Now why should that man have fainted?

THE WINNING OF THE GOLDEN CROSS      197  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     CHAPTER I  ROY'S SACRIFICE   \"Rejected by a large majority--I mean, elected by a large majority.\"  Roy Blakeley gathered up the ballots in his two hands, dropped them into the shoe box and pushed the box across the table to Mr. Ellsworth as if the matter were finally settled.  \"Honorable Roy Blakeley,\" he added, \"didn't even carry his own patrol.\"  This humiliating confession, offered in Roy's gayest manner, was true. The Silver Foxes had turned from their leader and, to a scout, voted for Tom Slade. It was hinted that Roy himself was responsible for this, but he was a good politician and would not talk. There was also a dark rumor that a certain young lady was mixed up in the matter and it is a fact that only the night before Roy and Mary Temple had been seen in earnest converse on the wide veranda at Grantley Square by Pee-wee Harris, who believed that a scout should be observant.  Be this as it may, Tom had carried his own patrol, the Elks, unanimously, and the Silver Foxes had voted for him like instructed delegates, while among the proud and dignified Ravens there had been but one dissenting vote. Someone had cast this for Pee-wee Harris, the Silver Fox mascot and the troop's chief exhibit. But, of course, it was only a joke. The idea of Pee-wee going away as assistant camp manager was preposterous. Why, you could hardly see him without a magnifying glass.  \"If this particular majority had been much larger,\" announced Roy, \"it wouldn't have been a majority at all; it would have been a unanimity.\"  \"A una _what_?\" someone asked.  \"A unanimity--that's Latin for home run. Seems a pity that the only thing that prevented a clean sweep was a little three-foot pocket edition of a boy scout----\"  At this moment, Pee-wee, by a miracle of dexterity, landed a ball of twine plunk in the middle of Roy's face.  \"Roy,\" laughed Mr. Ellsworth, \"you're a good campaign manager.\"  \"He's a boss,\" shouted Pee-wee, \"that's what he is. A boss is a feller that has people elected and then makes them do what he says.\"  \"Well, you were glad enough to vote for him with the rest, weren't you?\" laughed the scoutmaster.  And Pee-wee had to confess that he was.  But there was no doubt that Roy had managed the whole thing, and if ever political boss saw his fondest wishes realized Roy did now.  \"I think,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"that it is up to Tom to deliver his speech of acceptance.\"  \"Sure it is,\" said Westy Martin (Silver Fox). \"We want to know his policies. Is he going to favor the Elks or is he going to be neutral?\"  \"Is he for troop first or camp first?\" asked Doc. Carson (Raven and First-aid scout).  \"Is Roy Blakeley going to come in for three or four helpings at mess because he ran the campaign?\" asked Connie Bennett, of the new Elks.  \"Speech, speech!\" called Eddie Ingram, of the Silver Foxes.  Tom looked uneasily at Mr. Ellsworth and on the scoutmaster's laughing nod of encouragement arose.  He was not at his best in a thing of this kind; he had always envied Roy his easy, bantering manner, but he was not the one to shirk a duty, so he stood up.  He was about fifteen and of a heavy, ungraceful build. His hair was thick and rather scraggly, his face was of the square type, and his expression what people call stolid. He had freckles but not too many, and his mouth was large and his lips tight-set. His face wore a characteristic frown which was the last feeble trace of a lowering look which had once disfigured it. Frowns are in the taboo list of the scouts, but somehow this one wasn't half bad; there was a kind of rugged strength in it. He wore khaki trousers and a brown flannel shirt which was unbuttoned in front, exposing an expanse of very brown chest.  For Tom Slade's virtues you will have to plow through these pages if you have not already met him, but for his faults, they were printed all over him like cities on a map. He was stubborn, rather reticent, sometimes unreasonable, and carried with him that air of stolid self-confidence which is apt to be found in one who has surmounted obstacles and risen in spite of handicaps. It was often said in the troop that one never knew how to take Tom.  \"I think Pee-wee is right,\" he said, \"and I guess Roy managed this. I could see he was doing some private wig-wag work, and I think you've all been--what d'you call it--co-something or other----\"  \"Coerced!\" suggested Pee-wee.  (Cries of \"No, you're crazy!\")  \"But as long as I'm elected I'll take the job--and I'm very thankful. I won't deny I wanted it. Roy won't get any favors.\" (Cheers) \"If I have any deciding to do I'll decide the way I think is right. That's all I've got to say--oh, yes, there's one thing more--one thing I made up my mind to in case I was lucky enough to get elected.\" (Cries of \"Hear, hear!\") \"I'm not going to go by the railroad. I got an idea, like, that it doesn't took right for a scout to go to camp by train. So I'm going to hike it up to the camp. I'm going to start early enough so I can do it. When a scout steps off a train he looks like a summer boarder. I ask Roy to go with me if he can start when I do. I don't want you fellows to think I was expecting to be chosen. I didn't let myself think about it. But sometimes you can't help thinking about a thing; and the other night I said to myself that if anything should happen I should get elected----\"  (A voice, \"You didn't do a thing but walk away with it, Tommy!\")  (Cries of \"Shut up till he gets through!\")  \"I wouldn't go to that camp in a train. I'm not going to set foot in it till I'm qualified for a first-class scout, and I'm going to do the rest of my stunts on the way. I want Roy to go with me if he can. I thank you for electing me. I'll do my best in that job. If I knew how to say it, I'd thank you better. I guess I'm kind of rattled.\"  The blunt little speech was very characteristic of Tom and it was greeted with a storm of applause. He had a way of blurting out his plans and ideas without giving any previous hint of them, but this was something of a knockout blow.  \"Oh, you hit it right!\" shouted Pee-wee. \"Gee, I do hate railroad trains--railroad trains and homework.\"  \"You don't mean you're going to hike it from here, Tom, do you?\" asked Mr. Ellsworth.  \"I had an idea I might canoe up as far as Nyack,\" said Tom, \"and then follow the river up to Catskill Landing and hit in for Leeds--but, of course,\" he added, \"I didn't really expect to be elected.\"  \"Oh, crinkums!\" shouted Pee-wee. \"I'll go with you!\"  \"Well,\" said Roy, when the laughter had subsided, \"this is a new wrinkle and it sounds rather risky for a half-baked Elk----\" (Hisses from the Elks) \"So far as I'm concerned, I think a hike of a hundred miles or so----\"  \"You're crazy!\" interrupted Pee-wee. \"You silver-plated Fox----\"  \"Is too much,\" concluded Roy. \"In the first place, there would have to be a whole lot of discomfort.\" (Hisses) \"A fellow would be pretty sure to get his feet wet.\" (Mr. Ellsworth restrained Pee-wee with difficulty.) \"He would have to sleep out of doors in the damp night air----\" (A voice, \"Slap him on the wrist!\") \"And he would be likely to get lost. Scouts, it's no fun to be lost in the woods----\" (Cries of \"Yes, it is!\") \"We would be footsore and weary,\" continued Roy.  \"You got that out of a book!\" shouted Pee-wee. \"_Footsore and weary_--that's the way folks talk in books!\"  \"We might be caught in the rain,\" said Roy, soberly. \"We might have to pick our way along obscure trail or up steep mountains.\"  \"You ought to go and take a ride in a merry-go-round,\" cried Pee-wee, sarcastically.  \"In short, it is fraught with peril,\" said Roy.  \"You got _that_ out of a book, too,\" said Pee-wee, disgustedly, \"_fraught with peril_!\"  \"I think it is too much of an undertaking,\" said Roy, ignoring him. \"We can get round-trip tickets.\"  Pee-wee almost fell off his chair.  \"But, of course,\" continued Roy, soberly, \"a scout is not supposed to think of himself--especially a Silver Fox. I am a Silver Fox--sterling--warranted. A scout is a brother to every other scout. He ought to be ready to make sacrifices.\" (Mr. Ellsworth began to chuckle.)  \"He ought not to stand by and see a fellow scout in danger. He ought not to stand and see a poor Elk go headlong----\" (Hisses) \"He ought to be ready with a good turn regardless of his own comfort and safety.\" (Hoots and laughter) \"I am ready with a good turn. I am ready to sac----\" (Jeers) \"I am ready to sac----\" (Jeers) \"I am----\" (Cries of \"Noble lad!\") \"I am ready to sac----\"  \"Well, go ahead and _sac_, why don't you?\" shouted Pee-wee in disgust. \"You're a hyp----\""]]]
