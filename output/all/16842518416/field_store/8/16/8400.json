The Walpi site becoming crowded, some of the Bear and Lizard people moved out and built houses on the site of the present Sichumovi; several Asa families followed them, and after them came some of the Badger people. The village grew to an extent considerably beyond its present size, when it was abandoned on account of a malignant plague. After the plague, and within the present generation, the village was rebuilt--the old houses being torn down to make the new ones.  After the Asa came the nest group to arrive was the Water family. Their chief begins the story of their migration in this way:    In the long ago the Snake, Horn, and Eagle people lived here (in   Tusayan), but their corn grew only a span high, and when they sang   for rain the cloud god sent only a thin mist. My people then lived   in the distant Pa-lát Kwá-bi in the South. There was a very bad old   man there, who, when he met any one, would spit in his face, blow   his nose upon him, and rub ordure upon him. He ravished the girls   and did all manner of evil. Baholikonga got angry at this and turned   the world upside down, and water spouted up through the kivas and   through the fireplaces in the houses. The earth was rent in great   chasms, and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud;   and across this the serpent deity told all the people to travel. As   they journeyed across, the feet of the bad slipped and they fell   into the dark water, but the good, after many days, reached dry   land. While the water was rising around the village the old people   got on the tops of the houses, for they thought they could not   struggle across with the younger people; but Baholikonga clothed   them with the skins of turkeys, and they spread their wings out and   floated in the air just above the surface of the water, and in this   way they got across. There were saved of our people Water, Corn,   Lizard, Horned Toad, Sand, two families of Rabbit, and Tobacco. The   turkey tail dragged in the water--hence the white on the turkey tail   now. Wearing these turkey-skins is the reason why old people have   dewlaps under the chin like a turkey; it is also the reason why old   people use turkey-feathers at the religious ceremonies.  In the story of the wandering of the Water people, many vague references are made to various villages in the South, which they constructed or dwelt in, and to rocks where they carved their totems at temporary halting places. They dwelt for a long time at Homólobi, where the Sun people joined them; and probably not long after the latter left the Water people followed on after them. The largest number of this family seem to have made their dwellings first at Mashongnavi and Shupaulovi; but like the Sun people they soon spread to all the villages.  The narrative of part of this journey is thus given by the chief before quoted:    It occupied 4 years to cross the disrupted country. The kwakwanti (a   warrior order) went ahead of the people and carried seed of corn,   beans, melons, squashes, and cotton. They would plant corn in the   mud at early morning and by noon it was ripe and thus the people   were fed. When they reached solid ground they rested, and then they   built houses. The kwakwanti were always out exploring--sometimes   they were gone as long as four years. Again we would follow them on   long journeys, and halt and build houses and plant. While we were   traveling if a woman became heavy with child we would build her a   house and put plenty of food in it and leave her there, and from   these women sprang the Pima, Maricopa, and other Indians in the   South.    Away in the South, before we crossed the mountains (south of the   Apache country) we built large houses and lived there a long while.   Near these houses is a large rock on which was painted the   rain-clouds of the Water phratry, also a man carrying corn in his   arms; and the other phratries also painted the Lizard and the Rabbit   upon it. While they were living there the kwakwanti made an   expedition far to the north and came in conflict with a hostile   people. They fought day after day, for days and days--they fought by   day only and when night came they separated, each party retiring to   its own ground to rest. One night the cranes came and each crane   took a kwakwanti on his back and brought them back to their people   in the South.    Again all the people traveled north until they came to the Little   Colorado, near San Francisco Mountains, and there they built houses   up and down the river. They also made long ditches to carry the   water from the river to their gardens. After living there a long   while they began to be plagued with swarms of a kind of gnat called   the sand-fly, which bit the children, causing them to swell up and   die. The place becoming unendurable, they were forced again to   resume their travels. Before starting, one of the Rain-women, who   was big with child, was made comfortable in one of the houses on the   mountain. She told her people to leave her, because she knew this   was the place where she was to remain forever. She also told them,   that hereafter whenever they should return to the mountain to hunt   she would provide them with plenty of game. Under her house is a   spring and any sterile woman who drinks of its water will bear   children. The people then began a long journey to reach the summit   of the table land on the north. They camped for rest on one of the   terraces, where there was no water, and they were very tired and   thirsty. Here the women celebrated the rain-feast--they danced for   three days, and on the fourth day the clouds brought heavy rain and   refreshed the people. This event is still commemorated by a circle   of stones at that place. They reached a spring southeast from   Káibitho (Kumás Spring) and there they built a house and lived for   some time. Our people had plenty of rain and cultivated much corn   and some of the Walpi people came to visit us. They told ns that   their rain only came here and there in fine misty sprays, and a   basketful of corn was regarded as a large crop. So they asked us to   come to their land and live with them and finally we consented. When   we got there we found some Eagle people living near the Second Mesa;   our people divided, and part went with the Eagle and have ever since   remained there; but we camped near the First Mesa. It was planting   time and the Walpi celebrated their rain-feast but they brought only   a mere misty drizzle. Then we celebrated our rain-feast and planted.   Great rains and thunder and lightning immediately followed and on   the first day after planting our corn was half an arm’s length high;   on the fourth day it was its full height, and in one moon it was   ripe. When we were going up to the village (Walpi was then north of   the gap, probably), we were met by a Bear man who said that our   thunder frightened the women and we must not go near the village.   Then the kwakwanti said, “Let us leave these people and seek a land   somewhere else,” but our women said they were tired of travel and   insisted upon our remaining. Then “Fire-picker” came down from the   village and told us to come up there and stay, but after we had got   into the village the Walpi women screamed out against us--they   feared our thunder--and so the Walpi turned us away. Then our   people, except those who went to the Second Mesa, traveled to the   northeast as far as the Tsegi (Canyon de Chelly), but I can not tell   whether our people built the louses there. Then they came hack to   this region again and built houses and had much trouble with the   Walpi, but we have lived here ever since.    [Illustration: Plate XI. Masonry on the outer wall of the Fire-House,   detail.]  Groups of the Water people, as already stated, were distributed among all the villages, although the bulk of them remained at the Middle Mesa; but it seems that most of the remaining groups subsequently chose to build their permanent houses at Oraibi. There is no special tradition of this movement; it is only indicated by this circumstance, that in addition to the Water families common to every village, there are still in Oraibi several families of that people which have no representatives in any of the other villages. At a quite early day Oraibi became a place of importance, and they tell of being sufficiently populous to establish many outlying settlements. They still identify these with ruins on the detached mesas in the valley to the south and along the Moen-kopi (“place of flowing water”) and other intermittent streams in the west. These sites were occupied for the purpose of utilizing cultivable tracts of land in their vicinity, and the remotest settlement, about 45 miles west, was especially devoted to the cultivation of cotton, the place being still called by the Navajo and other neighboring tribes, the “cotton planting ground.” It is also said that several of the larger ruins along the course of the Moen-kopi were occupied by groups of the Snake, the Coyote, and the Eagle who dwelt in that region for a long period before they joined the people in Tusayan. The incursions of foreign bands from the north may have hastened that movement, and the Oraibi say they were compelled to withdraw all their outlying colonies. An episode is related of an attack upon the main village when a number of young girls were carried off, and 2 or 3 years afterward the same marauders returned and treated with the Oraibi, who paid a ransom in corn and received all their girls back again. After a quiet interval the pillaging bands renewed their attacks and the settlements on the Moen-kopi were vacated. They were again occupied after another peace was established, and this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19857"],["title","The Great War As I Saw It (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's note: -Obvious printer's errors have been corrected. -Variable spelling of hyphenated words has been made consistent. -Missing page numbers correspond to blank pages. -Punctuation conventions of the original have been retained. -Inconsistent spelling of place names has been retained.]     [Illustration: Frontispiece]                              The Great War as I Saw It     [Illustration: Frederick George Scott.]                               The Great War as I Saw It                                      by                   Canon Frederick George Scott, C.M.G., D.S.O.                              _Late Senior Chaplain_                         _First Canadian Division, C.E.F._             Author of \"Later Canadian Poems,\" and \"Hymn of the Empire.\"                               F.

I first heard of my friend and comrade after the second battle of Ypres when he accompanied his beloved Canadians to Bethune after their glorious stand in that poisonous gap--which in my own mind he immortalised in verse:--    O England of our fathers, and England of our sons,   Above the roar of battling hosts, the thunder of the guns,   A mother's voice was calling us, we heard it oversea,   The blood which thou didst give us, is the blood we spill for thee.  Little did I think when I first saw him that he could possibly, at his time of life, bear the rough and tumble of the heaviest fighting in history, and come through with buoyancy of spirit younger men envied and older men recognized as the sign and fruit of self-forgetfulness and the inspiration and cheering of others.  Always in the thick of the fighting, bearing almost a charmed life, ignoring any suggestion that he should be posted to a softer job \"further back,\" he held on to the very end.  The last time I saw him was in a hospital at Etaples badly wounded, yet cheery as ever--having done his duty nobly.  All the Canadians in France knew him, and his devotion and fearlessness were known all along the line, and his poems will, I am bold to prophesy, last longer in the ages to come than most of the histories of the war.  I feel sure that his book--if anything like himself--will interest and inspire all who read it.                                LLEWELLYN H. GWYNNE.                                           _Bishop of Khartoum,                                            Deputy Chaplain General                                            to the C. of E.

As I read it over, I am dismayed at finding how feebly it suggests the bitterness and the greatness of the sacrifice of our men. As the book is written from an entirely personal point of view, the use of the first personal pronoun is of course inevitable, but I trust that the narration of my experience has been used only as a lens through which the great and glorious deeds of our men may be seen by others. I have refrained, as far as possible, except where circumstances seemed to demand it, from mentioning the names of officers or the numbers of battalions.  I cannot let the book go out without thanking, for many acts of kindness, Lieut.-General Sir Edwin Alderson, K.C.B., Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Currie, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., and Major-General Sir Archibald Macdonell, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., who were each in turn Commanders of the First Canadian Division. In all the efforts the chaplains made for the welfare of the Division, they always had the backing of these true Christian Knights. Their kindness and consideration at all times were unbounded, and the degree of liberty which they allowed me was a privilege for which I cannot be too thankful, and which I trust I did not abuse.  If, by these faulty and inadequate reminiscences, dug out of memories which have blended together in emotions too deep and indefinable to be expressed in words, I have reproduced something of the atmosphere in which our glorious men played their part in the deliverance of the world, I shall consider my task not in vain.  May the ears of Canada never grow deaf to the plea of widows and orphans and our crippled men for care and support. May the eyes of Canada never be blind to that glorious light which shines upon our young national life from the deeds of those \"Who counted not their lives dear unto themselves,\" and may the lips of Canada never be dumb to tell to future generations the tales of heroism which will kindle the imagination and fire the patriotism of children that are yet unborn.
