If I were to hold out a bit of cake to him, and say, 'Ta,'\"--(and as I spoke I did so to a highly intelligent little gentleman who sat close to the bars of the cage with his eyes on my face, as if he were well aware that a question of deep importance to himself was being discussed)--  \"He would probably snatch it out of your hand without further ceremony,\" said my father. And, dashing his skinny fingers through the bars, this was, I regret to say, precisely what the little gentleman did. I was quite taken aback; but as we turned round, to my infinite delight, the undutiful baby snatched the biscuit from its mother's hand after a fashion so remarkably similar that we all burst out laughing, and I shouted in triumph,  \"Now, papa! children do it too.\"  \"Well, Regie,\" he answered, \"I think you have made out a good case. But the question which now remains is, whether Mrs. Bundle will have your young friends in the nursery.\"  But Mrs. Bundle's horror at my remarks was too great to admit of her even entering into the joke.  The monkeys were somewhat driven from my mind by the wit and wisdom of the elephant, and the condescension displayed by so large an animal in accepting the light refreshment of penny buns. After he had had several, Leo began to tease him, holding out a bun and snatching it away again. As he was holding it out for the fourth or fifth time, the elephant extended his trunk as usual, but instead of directing it towards the bun, he deliberately snatched the black velvet cap from Leo's head and swallowed it with a grunt of displeasure. Leo was first frightened, and then a good deal annoyed by the universal roar of laughter which his misfortune occasioned. But he was a good-tempered boy, and soon joined in the laugh himself. Then, as we could not buy him a new cap in the Gardens, he was obliged to walk about for the rest of the time bare-headed; and many were the people who turned round to look a second time after the beautiful boy with the long fair hair--a fact of which Master Lionel was not quite unconscious, I think.  My aunt kindly pressed us to remain with her over Christmas. I longed to see the pantomime, having heard much from my cousins and from Leo of its delights--and of the harlequin, columbine, and clown. But my father wanted to be at home again, and he took me and Rubens and Nurse Bundle with him at the end of November.     CHAPTER VII  POLLY AND I RESOLVE TO BE \"VERY RELIGIOUS\"--DR. PEPJOHN--THE ALMS-BOX--THE BLIND BEGGAR   I must not forget to speak of an incident which had a considerable influence on my character at this time. The church which my uncle and his family \"attended,\" as it was called, was one of those most dreary places of worship too common at that time, in London and elsewhere. It was ugly outside, but the outside ugliness was as nothing compared with the ugliness within. The windows were long and bluntly rounded at the top, and the sunlight was modified by scanty calico blinds, which, being yellow with age and smoke, _toned_ the light in rather an agreeable manner. Mouldings of a pattern one sees about common fireplaces ran everywhere with praiseworthy impartiality. But the great principle of the ornamental work throughout was a principle only too prevalent at the date when this particular church was last \"done up.\" It was imitations of things not really there, and which would have been quite out of place if they had been there. For instance, pillars and looped-up curtains painted on flat walls, with pretentious shadows, having no reference to the real direction of the light. At the east end some Hebrew letters, executed as journeymen painters usually do execute them, had a less cheerful look than the highly-coloured lion and unicorn on the gallery in front. The clerk's box, the reading-desk, and the pulpit, piled one above another, had a symmetrical effect, to which the umbrella-shaped sounding-board above gave a distant resemblance to a Chinese pagoda. The only things which gave warmth or colour to the interior as a whole were the cushions and pew curtains. There were plenty of them, and they were mostly red. These same curtains added to the sense of isolation, which was already sufficiently attained by the height of the pew walls and their doors and bolts. I think it was this--and the fact that, as the congregation took no outward part in the prayers except that of listening to them, Polly and I had nothing to do--and we could not even hear the old gentleman who usually \"read prayers\"--which led us into the very reprehensible habit of \"playing at houses\" in Uncle Ascott's gorgeously furnished pew. Not that we left our too tightly stuffed seats for one moment, but as we sat or stood, unable to see anything beyond the bombazine curtains (which, intervening between us and the distant parson, made our hearing what he said next to impossible), we amused ourselves by mentally \"pretending\" a good deal of domestic drama, in which the pew represented a house; and we related our respective \"plays\" to each other afterwards when we went home.  Wrong as it was, we did not intend to be irreverent, though I had the grace to feel slightly shocked when after a cheerfully lighted evening service, at which the claims of a missionary society had been enforced, Polly confided to me, with some triumph in her tone, \"I pretended a theatre, and when the man was going round with the box upstairs, I pretended it was oranges in the gallery.\"  I had more than once felt uneasy at our proceedings, and I now told Polly that I thought it was not right, and that we ought to \"try to attend.\" I rather expected her to resent my advice, but she said that she had \"sometimes thought it was wrong\" herself; and we resolved to behave better for the future, and indeed really did give up our unseasonable game.  Few religious experiences fill one with more shame and self-reproach than the large results from very small efforts in the right direction. Polly and I prospered in our efforts to \"attend.\" I may say for myself that, child as I was, I began to find a satisfaction and pleasure in going to church, though the place was hideous, the ritual dreary, and the minister mumbling. When by chance there was a nice hymn, such as, \"Glory to Thee,\" or \"O GOD, our help in ages past,\" we were quite happy. We also tried manfully to \"attend\" to the sermons, which, considering the length and abstruseness of them, was, I think, creditable to us. I fear we felt it to be so, and that about this time we began to be proud of the texts we knew, and of our punctilious propriety in the family pew, and of the resolve which we had taken in accordance with my proposal to Polly--  \"Let us be very religious.\"  One Saturday Miss Blomfield was a good deal excited about a certain clergyman who was to preach in our church next Sunday, and as the services were now a matter of interest to us, Polly and I were excited too. I had been troubled with toothache all the week, but this was now better, and I was quite able to go to church with the rest of the family.  The general drift of the sermon, even its text, have long since faded from my mind; but I do remember that it contained so highly coloured a peroration on the Day of Judgment and the terrors of Hell, that my horror and distress knew no bounds; and when the sermon was ended, and we began to sing, \"From lowest depths of woe,\" I burst into a passion of weeping. The remarkable part of the incident was that, the rest of the party having sat with their noses in the air quite undistressed by the terrible eloquence of the preacher, Aunt Maria never for a moment guessed at the real cause of my tears. But as soon as we were all in the carriage (it was a rainy evening, and we had driven to church), she said--  \"That poor child will never have a minute's peace while that tooth's in his head. Thomas! Drive to Dr. Pepjohn's.\"  Polly did say, \"Is it very bad, Regie?\" But Aunt Maria answered for me--\"Can't you see it's bad, child? Leave him alone.\"  I was ashamed to confess the real cause of my outburst, and suffered for my disingenuousness in Dr. Pepjohn's consulting-room.  \"Show Dr. Pepjohn which it is, Regie,\" said my aunt; and, with tears that had now become simply hysterical, I pointed to the tooth that had ached.  \"Just allow me to touch it,\" said Dr. Pepjohn, inserting his fat finger and thumb into my mouth. \"I won't hurt you, my little man,\" he added, with the affable mendaciousness of his craft. Fortunately for me it was rather loose, and a couple of hard wrenches from the doctor's expert fingers brought it out.  \"You think me very cruel, now, don't you, my little man?\" said the jocose gentleman, as we were taking leave.  \"I don't think you're cruel,\" I answered, candidly; \"but I think you tell fibs, for it _did_ hurt.\"  The doctor laughed long and loudly, and said I was quite an original, which puzzled me extremely. Then he gave me sixpence, with which I was much pleased, and we parted good friends.  My father was with us on the following Sunday, and he did not go to the church Aunt Maria went to. I went to the one to which he went. This church was very well built and appropriately decorated. The music was good, the responses of the congregation hearty, and the service altogether was much better adapted to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19867"],["title","Frank Merriwell, Junior's, Golden Trail; Or, The Fugitive Professor (#0)"],["body","Tip Top Weekly  No. 11; October 12, 1912.    FRANK MERRIWELL, JUNIOR's, GOLDEN TRAIL; Or, THE FUGITIVE PROFESSOR.  By BURT L. STANDISH.    CHAPTER I.  DREAMS AND OMENS.  \"Look here, you fellows,\" cried Ballard, \"if I don't get this out of my system I'm going to explode. It will only take a minute or two, and--\"  \"Go on and explode,\" cut in Clancy unfeelingly. \"Can't you see that Chip and I are busy?\"  \"But this dream was a corker, Red, and I--\"  \"For the love of Mike, Pink, I wish you'd _cork_. Wait till the work out there is wound up and then you can--wow! How was that for a tackle, Chip?\"  Three separate and distinct times, there in the grand stand, Billy Ballard had tried to tell his chums, young Frank Merriwell and Owen Clancy, of a dream he had the night before. It seemed to have occurred to suddenly, for the forenoon and part of the afternoon had slipped away without any attempt on Ballard's part to rehearse the fancies that had afflicted him in his sleep. But now he was feverishly eager, and the rebuffs he took from the annoyed Clancy only exasperated him.  It was hardly an opportune moment, however, to talk dreams and omens. Merry was wrapped up in a practice game of football, and was alternately scrutinizing players and hastily jotting down notes with a pencil. Clancy was not making any memoranda, but snappy work on the gridiron was claiming his full attention. With a sigh of resignation, Ballard bottled up his remarks and sat back on the hard boards.  Only Merry and his two chums were in the grand stand. The practice game was between the regular Ophir Athletic Club eleven and a scrub team. It had been put on for Frank's exclusive benefit.  For two straight years the O. A. C. had gone down to inglorious defeat before their rivals from Gold Hill--thirty-six to nothing on last Thanksgiving Day--and the sting of those defeats had made Ophir pessimistic and their eleven a joke. Another Thanksgiving Day was less than two months ahead, and the Ophir fellows were turning to Merriwell for help. They felt that if any one could pick an eleven from the club members and round them, into winning form, it was he, and he alone.  This was not the first practice game staged for Merriwell. The first one had degenerated into a farce, for the spirit of fun had taken untimely grip of the players and a promising exhibition had gone to pieces on a reef of horseplay. Spink and Handy, for the club, had waited upon Merry and tendered apologies, and a second game had been arranged. Circumstances over which Merry had had little control had kept him away from that second game; and now, four days later, the Ophir eleven were gallantly retrieving themselves.  The two teams had ranged themselves across the field, and a scrub foot had booted the oval well down toward the regulars' goal. A nervous full back waited to receive that opening kick, while his teammates rushed at him to form their flying screen of interference. The ball evaded the arms that reached for it, while another back fell on it and kept it clear of the clutches of a scrub end.  Frank scrawled a note on the paper that lay on his knee. \"That's Leversee,\" he remarked, \"but I think he'll steady down.\"  \"That scrub end is faster than a streak of greased lightning, Chip,\" commented the admiring Clancy. \"Good material, what?\"  Presently came the first scrimmage, and a regular half back, all beef and brawn, went down in a flurry. The scrub defense was like a stone wall. It was the second down and four yards to gain. The regular interferers dashed to get around one end of the line, but were flung to right and left, and the runner, dropped more than a yard short of the required distance.  The regular full back retreated for a punt. Fast and far the ball sailed into the scrub field, which proved that the back's feet were not nervous, no matter if his hands and arms had been a trifle unsteady.  \"Bully!\" muttered Frank, and scrawled another notation.  The scrubs, going up against the regulars' defense, found it impossible to make any decisive gains. Vigor and rocklike endurance marked the clashes, and both regulars and scrubs had to punt and punt again. Fake plays were riddled by swift and sagacious end rushes, for one side or the other, hurling attacks against the center were crushed and flung back; and, more and more as the battle raged, it became evident that the regular eleven, while good, were no whit better than the scrubs.  The fight in the first half was carried into the last minute of the play. The whistle separated the combatants, and neither side had scored.  During the interval that followed Ballard sought to tell his dream, Merriwell and Clancy, however, were in close and earnest conversation regarding the players and had no time for anything not connected with the game.  \"With material like that to choose from, Chip,\" said Clancy, \"it ought not to be much of a trick to select an eleven that would put it all over Gold Hill.\"  \"From all I can hear, Clan,\" Merry answered, \"the Gold Hill bunch is a fast one. I don't know what we can do. The Ophirites are liable to hit, their funny bone in the last half and turn the performance into a farce comedy.\"  \"Never again, Chip. Once was enough.\"  \"What happens once is always liable to happen again,\" Frank answered, \"although I'm hoping for the best.\"  His fears were not realized. The last half of the game, although faulty in spots, was, on the whole a creditable performance. Merriwell was more than pleased. When Spink and Handy, dusty and breathless, halted on their way to the showers and the dressing rooms to ask his opinion, Merry gave them the praise that was their due.  \"We can make up an eleven here that ought to do things to Gold Hill, fellows,\" said he.  \"They say that Gold Hill is so sure of getting our scalps for the third time,\" said Spink, \"that they haven't begun their fall work.\"  \"Which makes everything look all the brighter for Ophir,\" laughed Frank. \"Too much confidence is worse than not enough. You seem to think that I can help you, although I--\"  \"It's a cinch you can help us!\" broke in Handy. \"Wasn't your father the star coach at Yale?\"  A slight frown crossed Frank's face.  \"Don't try to pin any of dad's medals on me, Handy,\" said Frank. \"I didn't inherit any of his couching ability. Dad gave me a good, clean bringing-up. Ever since I've been old enough to waddle, he has made me stand on my own feet. If you fellows are bound that I can help you, I'll give some suggestions and do my best. I'll get the suggestions in shape and give them to you in a day or so.\"  The regulars and scrubs, who had grouped themselves at a little distance behind Spink and Handy, gave a delighted cheer. Frank, putting away his pencil and paper, smiled as he watched them trot away toward the gym.  \"Now,\" said Ballard, with a show of injured dignity, \"I wonder if you fellows can spare a little of your valuable time?\"  \"What's biting you, Pink?\" inquired Frank.  \"It's a dream,\" said Clancy derisively. \"Pink has been seeing things at night, and he has been boiling over to tell us about it ever since this practice game started. Why don't you get a dream book, you crazy, chump,\" he added to Ballard, \"and figure the visions out for yourself?\"  \"Or a joke book,\" said Frank. \"You can do about as much figuring from that as from anything else.\"  \"Oh, blazes!\" exclaimed Ballard. \"Don't make light of this dream. I just happened to remember, since we reached this grand stand, that I've had it three nights in succession. When a dream comes to you three times like that it's supposed to mean something.\"  \"Sure,\" agreed Clancy, wagging his head; \"it means that for three nights you have--er--eaten not wisely but too well. How's that, Chip? Pretty good, eh?\" He straightened up, looked grave, and went on to Ballard; \"Dreams, William, are the result of tantrums in the tummy. You load up a suffering organ with grub that's so rich it affects the imagination; consequently, when the razmataz, in a state of coma, projects itself into the _medulla oblongata_--\"  Ballard, yelling wildly, made a jump for Clancy. Merry, however, had already taken hint in hand.  \"That sounds too much like Professor Phineas Borredaile,\" said Frank. \"Call off the dog, Clan;\" and he smothered his red-headed chum and pushed him down on the hard boards.  \"I'll be good, Chip,\" murmured Clancy, in a stilted voice. \"Take your hands, off my face and let me breathe.\"  Frank released him with a laugh, and Clancy smoothed himself out.  \"I was only expounding,\" explained the red-headed chap, \"and now that the prof isn't around to do it, a substitute has to take hold.\"  \"Pink isn't the only one who has taken a foolish powder,\" said Merry.  \"And, talking about Phineas, what do you suppose the old fossil is up to?\" Clancy went on, just a shade of anxiety sifting into his tones. \"It's four days now, since he suddenly made up his mind to go over Gold Hill. What did he go for? And why is he staying away? We haven't heard a word from him since he left.\"  Merriwell looked serious.  \"All that has been bothering me, Clan,\" he acknowledged \"Since we found the prof in that deserted, mining camp, and helped him file a location on that mining claim, we're responsible for him, in a way. He need, looking after, and we have't been on the job at all.\"  \"After you disappeared mysteriously the other night,\" remarked Clancy, \"Mr. Bradlaugh had an idea that you had gone over to Gold Hill to see the prof. Mr. Bradlaugh called up the Bristow Hotel, at the Hill, and talked with Borrodaile. He said he hadn't seen you, on--\"  \"I know about that,\" Merry interrupted. \"That was four days ago, and we haven't seen Borrodaile nor had a word from him since. Honest, fellows, I'm getting worried. Before we started out here this afternoon I asked Mr. Bradlaugh to try and get the prof on the phone, and to ask him when he intended coming back to Ophir.
