PREFACE.   \"MARY'S MEADOW\" first appeared in the numbers of _Aunt Judy's Magazine_ from November 1883 to March 1884. It was the last serial story which Mrs. EWING wrote, and I believe the subject of it arose from the fact that in 1883, after having spent several years in moving from place to place, she went to live at Villa Ponente, Taunton, where she had a settled home with a garden, and was able to revert to the practical cultivation of flowers, which had been one of the favourite pursuits of her girlhood.  The Game of the Earthly Paradise was received with great delight by the readers of the story; one family of children adopted the word \"Mary-meadowing\" to describe the work which they did towards beautifying hedges and bare places; and my sister received many letters of inquiry about the various plants mentioned in her tale. These she answered in the correspondence columns of the Magazine, and in July 1884 it was suggested that a \"Parkinson Society\" should be formed, whose objects were \"to search out and cultivate old garden flowers which have become scarce; to exchange seeds and plants; to plant waste places with hardy flowers; to circulate books on gardening amongst the Members;\" and further, \"to try to prevent the extermination of rare wild flowers, as well as of garden treasures.\"  Reports of the Society, with correspondence on the exchanges of plants and books, and quaint local names of flowers, were given in the Magazine until it was brought to a close after Mrs. EWING'S death; but I am glad to say that the Society existed for some years under the management of the founder, Miss ALICE SARGANT, and when she was obliged to relinquish the work it was merged in the \"Selborne Society,\" which aims at the preservation of rare species of animals as well as plants.  The \"Letters from a Little Garden\" were published in _Aunt Judy's Magazine_ between November 1884 and February 1885, and as they, as well as \"Mary's Meadow,\" were due to the interest which my sister was taking in the tending of her own Earthly Paradise,--they are inserted in this volume, although they were left unfinished when the writer was called away to be      \"Fast in Thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!\"  HORATIA K.F. EDEN.  _December, 1895._         *       *       *       *       *  NOTE.--If any readers of \"Mary's Meadow\" have been as completely puzzled as the writer was by the title of John Parkinson's old book, it may interest them to know that the question has been raised and answered in _Notes and Queries_.  I first saw the _Paradisi in sole Paradisus terrestris_ at Kew, some years ago, and was much bewitched by its quaint charm. I grieve to say that I do not possess it; but an old friend and florist--the Rev. H.T. Ellacombe--was good enough to lend me his copy for reference, and to him I wrote for the meaning of the title. But his scholarship, and that of other learned friends, was quite at fault. My old friend's youthful energies (he will permit me to say that he is ninety-four) were not satisfied to rust in ignorance, and he wrote to _Notes and Queries_ on the subject, and has been twice answered. It is an absurd play upon words, after the fashion of John Parkinson's day. Paradise, as _Aunt Judy's_ readers may know, is originally an Eastern word, meaning a park, or pleasure-ground. I am ashamed to say that the knowledge of this fact did not help me to the pun. _Paradisi in sole Paradisus terrestris_ means Park--in--son's Earthly Paradise!  J.H.E., _February 1884._         *       *       *       *       *        How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean     Are Thy returns! ev'n as the flowers in spring;       To which, besides their own demean,     The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.               Grief melts away               Like snow in May,           As if there were no such cold thing.        Who would have thought my shrivel'd heart     Could have recover'd greenness? It was gone       Quite under ground; as flowers depart     To see their mother-root, when they have blown;               Where they together               All the hard weather,           Dead to the world, keep house unknown.         *       *       *       *       *        O that I once past changing were,     Fast in Thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!       Many a spring I shoot up fair,     Offering at heaven, growing and groaning thither;               Nor doth my flower               Want a spring-shower,           My sins and I joining together.         *       *       *       *       *        These are Thy wonders, Lord of love,     To make us see we are but flowers that glide:       Which when we once can find and prove,     Thou hast a garden for us, where to bide.               Who would be more,               Swelling through store,           Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.  GEORGE HERBERT.         *       *       *       *       *     MARY'S MEADOW  CHAPTER I.   Mother is always trying to make us love our neighbours as ourselves.  She does so despise us for greediness, or grudging, or snatching, or not sharing what we have got, or taking the best and leaving the rest, or helping ourselves first, or pushing forward, or praising Number One, or being Dogs in the Manger, or anything selfish. And we cannot bear her to despise us!  We despise being selfish, too; but very often we forget. Besides, it is sometimes rather difficult to love your neighbour as yourself when you want a thing very much; and Arthur says he believes it is particularly difficult if it is your next-door-neighbour, and that that is why Father and the Old Squire quarrelled about the footpath through Mary's Meadow.  The Old Squire is not really his name, but that is what people call him. He is very rich. His place comes next to ours, and it is much bigger, and he has quantities of fields, and Father has only got a few; but there are two fields beyond Mary's Meadow which belong to Father, though the Old Squire wanted to buy them. Father would not sell them, and he says he has a right of way through Mary's Meadow to go to his fields, but the Old Squire says he has nothing of the kind, and that is what they quarrelled about.  Arthur says if you quarrel, and are too grown-up to punch each other's heads, you go to law; and if going to law doesn't make it up, you appeal. They went to law, I know, for Mother cried about it; and I suppose it did not make it up, for the Old Squire appealed.  After that he used to ride about all day on his grey horse, with Saxon, his yellow bull-dog, following him, to see that we did not trespass on Mary's Meadow. I think he thought that if we children were there, Saxon would frighten us, for I do not suppose he knew that we knew him. But Saxon used often to come with the Old Squire's Scotch Gardener to see our gardener, and when they were looking at the wall-fruit, Saxon used to come snuffing after us.  He is the nicest dog I know. He looks very savage, but he is only very funny. His lower jaw sticks out, which makes him grin, and some people think he is gnashing his teeth with rage. We think it looks as if he were laughing--like Mother Hubbard's dog, when she brought home his coffin, and he wasn't dead--but it really is only the shape of his jaw. I loved Saxon the first day I saw him, and he likes me, and licks my face. But what he likes best of all are Bath Oliver Biscuits.  One day the Scotch Gardener saw me feeding him, and he pulled his red beard, and said, \"Ye do weel to mak' hay while the sun shines, Saxon, my man. There's sma' sight o' young leddies and sweet cakes at hame for ye!\" And Saxon grinned, and wagged his tail, and the Scotch Gardener touched his hat to me, and took him away.  The Old Squire's Weeding Woman is our nursery-maid's aunt. She is not very old, but she looks so, because she has lost her teeth, and is bent nearly double. She wears a large hood, and carries a big basket, which she puts down outside the nursery door when she comes to tea with Bessy. If it is a fine afternoon, and we are gardening, she lets us borrow the basket, and then we play at being weeding women in each other's gardens.  She tells Bessy about the Old Squire. She says--\"He do be a real old skinflint, the Old Zquire a be!\" But she thinks it--\"zim as if 'twas having ne'er a wife nor child for to keep the natur' in 'un, so his heart do zim to shrivel, like they walnuts Butler tells us of as a zets down for desart. The Old Zquire he mostly eats ne'er a one now's teeth be so bad. But a counts them every night when's desart's done. And a keeps 'em till the karnels be mowldy, and a keeps 'em till they be dry, and a keeps 'em till they be dust; and when the karnels is dust, a cracks aal the lot of 'em when desart's done, zo's no one mayn't have no good of they walnuts, since they be no good to be.\"  Arthur can imitate the Weeding Woman exactly, and he can imitate the Scotch Gardener too. Chris (that is Christopher, our youngest brother) is very fond of \"The Zquire and the Walnuts.\" He gets nuts, or anything, like shells or bits of flower-pots, that will break, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19644"],["title","Mary's Meadow, and Other Tales of Fields and Flowers (#1)"],["body","something to hit with, and when Arthur comes to \"_The karnels is dust_,\" Chris smashes everything before him, shouting, \"_A cracks aal the lot of em_,\" and then he throws the bits all over the place, with \"_They be no good to he_.\"  Father laughed very much when he heard Arthur do the Weeding Woman, and Mother could not help laughing too; but she did not like it, because she does not like us to repeat servants' gossip.  The Weeding Woman is a great gossip. She gossips all the time she is having her tea, and it is generally about the Old Squire. She used to tell Bessy that his flowers bloomed themselves to death, and the fruit rotted on the walls, because he would let nothing be picked, and gave nothing away, except now and then a grand present of fruit to Lady Catherine, for which the old lady returned no thanks, but only a rude message to say that his peaches were over-ripe, and he had better have sent the grapes to the Infirmary. Adela asked--\"Why is the Old Squire so kind to Lady Catherine?\" and Father said--\"Because we are so fond of Lords and Ladies in this part of the country.\" I thought he meant the lords and ladies in the hedges, for we are very fond of them. But he didn't. He meant real lords and ladies.  There are splendid lords and ladies in the hedges of Mary's Meadow. I never can make up my mind when I like them best. In April and May, when they have smooth plum-coloured coats and pale green cowls, and push up out of last year's dry leaves, or in August and September, when their hoods have fallen away, and their red berries shine through the dusty grass and nettles that have been growing up round them all the summer out of the ditch.  Flowers were one reason for our wanting to go to Mary's Meadow. Another reason was the nightingale. There was one that used always to sing there, and Mother had made us a story about it.  We are very fond of fairy books, and one of our greatest favourites is Bechstein's _As Pretty as Seven._ It has very nice pictures, and we particularly like \"The Man in the Moon, and How He Came There;\" but the story doesn't end well, for he came there by gathering sticks on Sunday, and then scoffing about it, and he has been there ever since. But Mother made us a new fairy tale about the nightingale in Mary's Meadow being the naughty woodcutter's only child, who was turned into a little brown bird that lives on in the woods, and sits on a tree on summer nights, and sings to its father up in the moon.  But after our Father and the Old Squire went to law, Mother told us we must be content with hearing the nightingale from a distance. We did not really know about the lawsuit then, we only understood that the Old Squire was rather crosser than usual; and we rather resented being warned not to go into Mary's Meadow, especially as Father kept saying we had a perfect right so to do. I thought that Mother was probably afraid of Saxon being set at us, and of course I had no fears about him. Indeed, I used to wish that it could happen that the Old Squire, riding after me as full of fury as King Padella in the _Rose and the Ring_, might set Saxon on me, as the lions were let loose to eat the Princess Rosalba. \"Instead of devouring her with their great teeth, it was with kisses they gobbled her up. They licked her pretty feet, they nuzzled their noses in her lap,\" and she put her arms \"round their tawny necks and kissed them.\" Saxon gobbles us with kisses, and nuzzles his nose, and we put our arms round his tawny neck. What a surprise it would be to the Old Squire to see him! And then I wondered if my feet were as pretty as Rosalba's, and I thought they were, and I wondered if Saxon would lick them, supposing that by any possibility it could ever happen that I should be barefoot in Mary's Meadow at the mercy of the Old Squire and his bull-dog.  One does not, as a rule, begin to go to bed by letting down one's hair, and taking off one's shoes and stockings. But one night I was silly enough to do this, just to see if I looked (in the mirror) at all like the picture of Rosalba in the _Rose and the Ring._ I was trying to see my feet as well as my hair, when I heard Arthur jumping the three steps in the middle of the passage between his room and mine. I had only just time to spring into the window-seat, and tuck my feet under me, when he gave a hasty knock, and bounced in with his telescope in his hand.  \"Oh, Mary,\" he cried, \"I want you to see the Old Squire, with a great-coat over his evening clothes, and a squash hat, marching up and down Mary's Meadow.\"  And he pulled up my blind, and threw open the window, and arranged the telescope for me.  It was a glorious night. The moon was rising round and large out of the mist, and dark against its brightness I could see the figure of the Old Squire pacing the pathway over Mary's Meadow.  Saxon was not there; but on a slender branch of a tree in the hedgerow sat the nightingale, singing to comfort the poor, lonely old Man in the Moon.     CHAPTER II.   Lady Catherine is Mother's aunt by marriage, and Mother is one of the few people she is not rude to.  She is very rude, and yet she is very kind, especially to the poor. But she does kind things so rudely, that people now and then wish that she would mind her own business instead. Father says so, though Mother would say that that is gossip. But I think sometimes that Mother is thinking of Aunt Catherine when she tells us that in kindness it is not enough to be good to others, one should also learn to be gracious.  Mother thought she was very rude to _her_ once, when she said, quite out loud, that Father is very ill-tempered, and that, if Mother had not the temper of an angel, the house could never hold together. Mother was very angry, but Father did not mind. He says our house will hold together much longer than most houses, because he swore at the workmen, and went to law with the builder for using dirt instead of mortar, so the builder had to pull down what was done wrong, and do it right; and Father says he knows he has a bad temper, but he does not mean to pull the house over our heads at present, unless he has to get bricks out to heave at Lady Catherine if she becomes quite unbearable.  We do not like dear Father to be called bad-tempered. He comes home cross sometimes, and then we have to be very quiet, and keep out of the way; and sometimes he goes out rather cross, but not always. It was what Chris said about that that pleased Lady Catherine so much.  It was one day when Father came home cross, and was very much vexed to find us playing about the house. Arthur had got a new Adventure Book, and he had been reading to us about the West Coast of Africa, and niggers, and tom-toms, and \"going Fantee;\" and James gave him a lot of old corks out of the pantry, and let him burn them in a candle. It rained, and we could not go out; so we all blacked our faces with burnt cork, and played at the West Coast in one of the back passages, and at James being the captain of a slave ship, because he tried to catch us when we beat the tom-toms too near him when he was cleaning the plate, to make him give us rouge and whitening to tattoo with.  Dear Father came home rather earlier than we expected, and rather cross. Chris did not hear the front door, because his ears were pinched up with tying curtain rings on to them, and just at that minute he shouted, \"I go Fantee!\" and tore his pinafore right up the middle, and burst into the front hall with it hanging in two pieces by the armholes, his eyes shut, and a good grab of James's rouge-powder smudged on his nose, yelling and playing the tom-tom on what is left of Arthur's drum.  Father was very angry indeed, and Chris was sent to bed, and not allowed to go down to dessert; and Lady Catherine was dining at our house, so he missed her.  Next time she called, and saw Chris, she asked him why he had not been at dessert that night. Mother looked at Chris, and said, \"Why was it, Chris? Tell Aunt Catherine.\" Mother thought he would say, \"Because I tore my pinafore, and made a noise in the front hall.\" But he smiled, the grave way Chris does, and said, \"Because Father came home cross.\" And Lady Catherine was pleased, but Mother was vexed.  I am quite sure Chris meant no harm, but he does say very funny things. Perhaps it is because his head is rather large for his body, with some water having got into his brain when he was very little, so that we have to take care of him. And though he does say very odd things, very slowly, I do not think any one of us tries harder to be good.  I remember once Mother had been trying to make us forgive each other's trespasses, and Arthur would say that you cannot _make_ yourself feel kindly to them that trespass against you; and Mother said if you make yourself do right, then at last you get to feel right; and it was very soon after this that Harry and Christopher quarrelled, and would not forgive each other's trespasses in the least, in spite of all that I could do to try and make peace between them.  Chris went off in the sulks, but after a long time I came upon him in the toy-cupboard, looking rather pale and very large-headed, and winding up his new American top, and talking to himself.  When he talks to himself he mutters, so I could only just hear what he was saying, and he said it over and over again:  \"_Dos first and feels afterwards_.\"  \"What are you doing, Chris?\" I asked.  \"I'm getting ready my new top to give to Harry. _Dos first and feels afterwards._\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"Christopher, you _are_ a good boy.\"  \"I should like to punch his head,\" said Chris--and he said it in just the same sing-song tone--\"but I'm getting the top ready. _Dos first and feels afterwards_.\"  And he went on winding and muttering.  Afterwards he told me that the \"feels\" came sooner than he expected. Harry wouldn't take his top, and they made up their quarrel.  Christopher is very simple, but sometimes we think he is also a little sly. He can make very"]]]
