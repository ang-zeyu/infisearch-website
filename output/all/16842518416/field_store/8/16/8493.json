See? You hold the ball like this--so that your fingers give it a spin as it leaves your hand.\"  And he demonstrated for his English friend's benefit the way the ball is held to produce an out-curve.  \"Your bowlers here don't seem to do that--though they do make the ball break after it hits the ground. But the way I manage it, you see, is to throw a ball that doesn't hit the ground in front of the bat at all, but curves in. If you don't hit at it, it will hit the stumps and bowl you out; if you do hit, you're likely to send it straight up in the air, so that some fielder can catch it.\"  \"I see,\" said Dick. \"Well, I suppose it's all right, but it doesn't seem quite fair.\"  Harry laughed, but didn't try to explain the point further. He liked Dick immensely; Dick was the first friend he had made in England, and the best, so far. It was Dick who had tried to get him to join the Boy Scouts, and who had been immensely surprised to find that Harry was already a scout. Harry, indeed, had done two years of scouting in America; he had been one of the first members of a troop in his home town, and had won a number of merit badges. He was a first-class scout, and, had he stayed with his troop, would certainly have become a patrol leader. So he had had no trouble in getting admission to the patrol to which Dick belonged.  It had been hard for Harry, when his father's business called him to England, to give up all the friendships and associations of his boyhood. It had been hard to leave school; to tear up, by the roots, all the things that bound him to his home. But as a scout he had learned to be loyal and obedient. His parents had talked things over with him very frankly. They had understood just how hard it would be for him to go with them. But his father had made him see how necessary it was.  \"I want you to be near your mother and myself just now, especially, Harry,\" he had said. \"I want you to grow up where I can see you. And, moreover, it won't hurt you a bit to know something about other countries. You'll have a new idea of America when you have seen other lands, and I believe you'll be a better American for it. You'll learn that other countries have their virtues, and that we can learn some things from them. But I believe you'll learn, too, to love America better than ever. When we go home you'll be broader and better for your experience.\"  And Harry was finding out that his father had been right. At first he had to put up with a good deal. He found that the English boys he met in school felt themselves a little superior. They didn't look down on him, exactly, but they were, perhaps, the least bit sorry for him because he was not an Englishman, always a real misfortune in their sight.  He had resented that at first. But his Boy Scout training stood him in good stead. He kept his temper, and it was not long before he began to make friends. He excelled at games; even the English games, that were new and strange to him, presented few difficulties to him. As he had explained to Dick, cricket was easy for any boy who could play baseball fairly well. And it was the same way with football. After the far more strenuous American game, he shone at the milder English football, the Rugby game, which is the direct ancestor of the sport in America.  All these things helped to make Harry popular. He was now nearly sixteen, tall and strong for his age, thanks to the outdoor life he had always lived. An only son, he and his father had always been good friends. Without being in any way a molly-coddle, still he had been kept safe from a good many of the temptations that beset some boys by this constant association with his father. It was no wonder, therefore, that John Grenfel, as soon as he had talked with Harry and learned of the credentials he bore from his home troop, had welcomed him enthusiastically as a recruit to his own troop.  It had been necessary to modify certain rules. Harry, of course, could not subscribe to quite the same scout oath that bound his English fellows. But he had taken his scout oath as a tenderfoot at home, and Grenfel had no doubts about him. He was the sort of boy the organization wanted, whether in England or America, and that was enough for Grenfel.  Though the boys, as they walked toward their homes, did not quite realize it, they were living in days that were big with fate. Far away, in the chancelleries of Europe, and, not so far away, in the big government buildings in the West End of London, the statesmen were even then making their last effort to avert war. No one in England perhaps, really believed that war was coming. There had been war scares before. But the peace of Europe had been preserved for forty years or more, through one crisis after another. And so it was a stunning surprise, even to Grenfel, when, as they came into Putney High street, just before they reached Putney Bridge, they met a swarm of newsboys excitedly shrieking extras.  \"Germany threatens Russia!\" they yelled. \"War sure!\"  Mr. Grenfel bought a paper, and the scouts gathered about him while he read the news that was contained on the front page, still damp from the press.  \"I'm afraid it's true,\" he said, soberly. \"The German Emperor has threatened to go to war with Russia, unless the Czar stops mobilizing his troops at once. We shall know to-night. But I think it means war! God send that England may still keep out of it!\"  For that night a meeting at Mr. Grenfel's home in West Kensington had long been planned. He lived not far from the street in which both Harry and Dick lived. And, as the party broke up, on the other side of Putney Bridge, Dick, voicing the general feeling, asked a question.  \"Are we to come to-night, sir?\" he said. \"With this news--?\"  \"Yes--yes, indeed,\" said the scoutmaster. \"If war is to come, there is all the more reason for us to be together. England may need all of us yet.\"  Dick had asked the question because, like all the others, he felt something that was in the air. He was sobered by the news, although, like the rest, he did not yet fully understand it. But they all felt that there had been a change. As they looked about at the familiar sight about them they wondered if, a year from then, everything would still be the same. War? What did it mean to them, to England?  \"I wonder if my father will go to war!\" Dick broke out suddenly, as he and Harry walked along.  \"I hadn't thought of that!\" said Harry, startled. \"Oh, Dick, I'm sorry! Still, I suppose he'll go, if his country needs him!\"     CHAPTER II  QUICK WORK   At home, Harry had an early dinner with his father and mother, who were going to the theatre. They lived in a comfortable house, which Mr. Fleming had taken on a five-year lease when they came to England to live. It was one of a row of houses that looked very much alike, which, itself, was one of four sides of a square. In the centre of the square was a park-like space, a garden, really. In this garden were several tennis courts, with plenty of space, also, for nurses and children. There are many such squares in London, and they help to make the British capital a delightful place in which to live.  As he went in, Harry saw a lot of the younger men who lived in the square playing tennis. It was still broad daylight, although, at home, dusk would have fallen. But this was England at the end of July and the beginning of August, and the light of day would hold until ten o'clock or thereabout.  That was one of the things that had helped to reconcile Harry to living in England. He loved the long evenings and the chance they gave to get plenty of sport and exercise after school hours. The school that he and Dick attended was not far away; they went to it each day. A great many of the boys boarded at the school, but there were plenty who, like Dick and Harry, did not. But school was over now, for the time. The summer holidays had just begun.  At the table there was much talk of the war that was in the air. But Mr. Fleming did not even yet believe that war was sure.  \"They'll patch it up,\" he said, confidently. \"They can't be so mad as to set the whole world ablaze over a little scrap like the trouble between Austria and Servia.\"  \"Would it affect your business, dear?\" asked Mrs. Fleming. \"If there really should be war, I mean?\"  \"I don't think so,\" said he. \"I might have to make a flying trip home, but I'd be back. Come on--time for us to go. What are you going to do, boy? Going over to Grenfel's, aren't you?\"  \"Yes, father,\" said Harry.  \"All right. Get home early. Good-night!\"  A good many of the boys were already there when Dick and Harry reached Grenfel's house. The troop--the Forty-second, of London--was a comparatively small one, having only three patrols. But nearly all of them were present, and the scoutmaster took them out into his garden.  \"I'm going to change the order a bit,\" he said, gravely. \"I want to do some talking, and then I expect to answer questions. Boys, Germany has declared war on Russia. There are reports already of fighting on the border between France and Germany. And there seems to be an idea that the Germans are certain to strike at France through Belgium. I may not be here very long--I may have to turn over the troop to another scoutmaster. So I want to have a long talk to-night.\"  There was a dismayed chorus.  \"What? You going away, sir? Why?\"  But Harry did not join. He saw the quiet blaze in John Grenfel's eyes, and he thought he knew.  \"I've volunteered for foreign service already,\" Grenfel explained. \"I saw a little fighting in the Boer war, you know. And I may be useful. So I thought I'd get my application in directly. If I go, I'll probably go quietly and quickly. And there may be no other chance for me to say good-bye.\"  \"Then you think England will be drawn in, sir?\" asked Leslie Franklin, leader of the patrol to which Dick and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19957"],["title","Facing the German Foe (#2)"],["body","belonged, the Royal Blues.  \"I'm afraid so,\" said Grenfel, grimly. \"There's just a chance still, but that's all--the ghost of a chance, you might call it. I think it might be as well if I explained a little of what's back of all this trouble. Want to listen? If you do, I'll try. And if I'm not making myself clear, ask all the questions you like.\"  There was a chorus of assent. Grenfel sat in the middle, the scouts ranged about him in a circle.  \"In the first place,\" he began, \"this Servian business is only an excuse. I'm not defending the Servians--I'm taking no sides between Servia and Austria. Here in England we don't care about that, because we know that if that hadn't started the war, something else would have been found.  \"England wants peace. And it seems that, every so often, she has to fight for it. It was so when the Duke of Marlborough won his battles at Blenheim and Ramillies and Malplaquet. Then France was the strongest nation in Europe. And she tried to crush the others and dominate everything. If she had, she would have been strong enough, after her victories, to fight us over here--to invade England. So we went into that war, more than two hundred years ago, not because we hated France, but to make a real peace possible. And it lasted a long time.  \"Then, after the French revolution, there was Napoleon. Again France, under him, was the strongest nation in Europe. He conquered Germany, and Austria, Italy and Spain, the Netherlands. And he tried to conquer England, so that France could rule the world. But Nelson beat his fleet at Trafalgar--\"  \"Hurrah!\" interrupted Dick, carried away. \"Three cheers for Nelson!\"  Grenfel smiled as the cheers were given.  \"Even after Trafalgar,\" he went on, \"Napoleon hoped to conquer England. He had massed a great army near Boulogne, ready to send it across the channel. And so we took the side of the weaker nations again. All Europe, led by England, rose against Napoleon. And you know what happened. He was beaten finally at Waterloo. And so there was peace again in Europe for a long time, with no one nation strong enough to dictate to all the others. But then Germany began to rise. She beat Austria, and that made her the strongest German country. Then she beat France, in 1870, and that gave her her start toward being the strongest nation on the continent.  \"And then, I believe--and so do most Englishmen--she began to be jealous of England. She wanted our colonies. She began, finally, to build a great navy. For years we have had to spend great sums of money to keep our fleet stronger than hers. And she made an alliance with Austria and Italy. Because of that France and Russia made an alliance, too, and we had to be friendly with them. And now it looks to me as if Germany thought she saw a chance to beat France and Russia. Perhaps she thinks that we won't fight, on account of the trouble in Ireland. And what we English fear is that, if she wins, she will take Belgium and Holland. Then she would be so close to our coasts that we would never be safe. We would have to be prepared always for invasion. So, you see, it seems to me that we are facing the same sort of danger we have faced before. Only this time it is Germany, instead of France, that we shall have to fight--if we do fight.\"  \"If the Germans go through Belgium, will that mean that we shall fight?\" asked Leslie Franklin.  \"Almost certainly, yes,\" said Grenfel. \"And it is through Belgium that Germany has her best chance to strike at France. So you see how serious things are. I don't want to go into all the history that is back of all this. I just want you to understand what England's interest is. If we make war, it will be a war of self-defence. Suppose you owned a house. And suppose the house next door caught fire. You would try to put out that fire, wouldn't you, to save your own house from being burned up? Well, that's England's position. If the Germans held Belgium or Holland--and they would hold both, if they beat France and Russia--England would then be in just as much danger as your house would be. So if we fight, it will be to put out the German fire in the house next door.  \"Now I want you to understand one thing. I'm talking as an Englishman. A German would tell you all this in a very different way. I don't like the people who are always slandering their enemies. Germany has her reasons for acting as she does. I think her reasons are wrong. But the Germans believe that they are right. We can respect even people who are wrong if they themselves believe that they are right. There may be two sides to this quarrel. And Germans, even if they are to be our enemies, may be just as patriotic, just as devoted to their country, as we are. Never forget that, no matter what may happen.\"  He stopped then, waiting for questions. None came.  \"Then you understand pretty well?\" he asked.  There was a murmur of assent from the whole circle.  \"All right, then,\" he said. \"Now there's work for Scouts to do. _Be prepared!_ That's our motto, isn't it? Suppose there's war. Franklin, what's your idea of what the Boy Scouts would be able to do?\"  \"I suppose those who are old enough could volunteer, sir,\" said Franklin, doubtfully. \"I can't think of anything else--\"  \"Time enough for that later,\" said Grenfel, with a short laugh. \"England may have to call boys to the colors before she's done, if she once starts to fight. But long before that time comes, there will be a great work for the organization we all love and honor. Work that won't be showy, work that will be very hard. Boys, everyone in England, man and woman and child will have work to do! And we, who are organized, and whose motto is _Be prepared_, ought to be able to show what stuff there is in us.  \"Think of all the places that must be guarded. The waterworks, the gas tanks, the railroads that lead to the seaports and that will be used by the troops.\"  A startled burst of exclamations answered him.  \"Why, there won't be any fighting in England, sir, will there?\" asked Dick Mercer, in surprise.  \"We all hope not,\" said Grenfel. \"But that's not what I mean. It doesn't take an army to destroy a railroad. One man with a bomb and a time fuse attached to it can blow up a culvert and block a whole line so that precious hours might be lost in getting troops aboard a transport. One man could blow up a waterworks or a gas tank or cut an important telegraph or telephone wire!\"  \"You mean that there will be Germans here trying to hurt England any way they can, don't you, sir?\" asked Harry Fleming.  \"I mean exactly that,\" said Grenfel. \"We don't know this--we can't be sure of it. But we've got good reason to believe that there are a great many Germans here, seemingly peaceable enough, who are regularly in the pay of the German government as spies. We don't know the German plans. But there is no reason, so far as we know, why their great Zeppelin airships shouldn't come sailing over England, to drop bombs down where they can do the most harm. There is nothing except our own vigilance to keep these spies, even if they have to work alone, from doing untold damage!\"  \"We could be useful as sentries, then?\" said Leslie Franklin. He drew a deep breath. \"I never thought of things like that, sir! I'm just beginning to see how useful we really might be. We could do a lot of things instead of soldiers, couldn't we? So that they would be free to go and fight?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the scoutmaster. \"And I can tell you now that the National Scout Council has always planned to 'Be Prepared!' It decided, a long time ago, what should be done in case of war. A great many troops will be offered to the War Department to do odd jobs. They will carry messages and dispatches. They will act as clerks, so far as they can. They will patrol the railways and other places that ought to be under guard, where soldiers can be spared if we take their places. So far as such things can be planned, they have been planned.  \"But most of the ways in which we can be useful haven't showed themselves at all yet. They will develop, if war comes. We shall have to be alert and watchful, and do whatever there is to be done.\"  \"Who will be scoutmaster, sir, if you go to the war?\" asked Harry.  \"I'm not quite sure,\" said Grenfel. \"We haven't decided yet. But it will be someone you can trust--be sure of that. And I think I needn't say that if you scouts have any real regard for me you will show it best by serving as loyally and as faithfully under him as you have under me. I shall be with you in spirit, no matter where I am. Now it's getting late. I think we'd better break up for to-night. We will make a special order, too, for the present. Every scout in the troop will report at scout headquarters until further notice, every day, at nine o'clock in the morning.  \"I think we'll have to make up our minds not to play many games for the time that is coming. There is real work ahead of us if war comes--work just as real and just as hard, in its way, as if we were all going to fight for England. Everyone cannot fight, but the ones who stay at home and do the work that comes to their hands will serve England just as loyally as if they were on the firing line! Now--up, all of you! Three cheers for King George!\"  They were given with a will--and Harry Fleming joined in as heartily as any of them. He was as much of an American as he had ever been, but something in him responded with a strange thrill to England's need, as Grenfel had expressed it. After all, England had been and was the mother country. England and America had fought, in their time, and America had won, but now, for a hundred years, there had been peace between them. And he and these English boys were of the same blood and the same language, binding them very closely together.  \"Blood is thicker than water, after all!\" he thought.  Then every scout there shook hands with John Grenfel. He smiled as he greeted them.  \"I hope this will pass over,\" he said, \"and that we'l"]]]
