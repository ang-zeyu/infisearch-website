And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.  Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  _The White Christmas._  As the three wise men rode on that first Christmas night to find the manger-cradled Babe of Bethlehem, they bore gifts on their saddle-bows. Gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. And so the spirit of Christmas giving crept into the world's heart. We bring our gifts to the children. Rich children, poor children! The children of the high and the children of the humble! Poor little sick children--and the ragged children of the slums of our cities. Let us remember them all.  So go ye, all of ye, into the highways and byways, and seek out the poor and the distressed, the humble and the afflicted, seek out the ragged children and the outcasts and the aged ones, and in the name of Him who was born on Christmas day, carry some sunshine into their hearts! Give unto the poor and the afflicted, and your hearts shall glow with that inward peace that passeth all understanding.  Then--and then only--will you be able to sing with all the company of Heaven, Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, good will toward men! And this will be your pure white Christmas. (_Exit_ PROLOGUE _at L._)  _Soft chimes are heard. The curtains are drawn, disclosing the same scene as before._ DEBORAH _sits before her inn, deep in thought._  DEBORAH (_reading a scroll_).  This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.  _Enter_ GASPAR _from behind the inn. He comes down center._  GASPAR.      I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite,      If any wonders you have seen this night?  DEBORAH (_rises_).      I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light      Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.  GASPAR.      Tell me, for thou art native of this place,      What dost thou know about the King of Grace--      King of the Jews?  DEBORAH.      Aye, in Jerusalem      He dwells, and not in Bethlehem.      He sits upon his mighty judgment throne,      Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.  GASPAR.      I mean a new-born King, of love and peace;      His is the star--His reign shall never cease.  DEBORAH.      All things tonight seem passing strange to me,      I have just read an ancient prophecy      That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town,      Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown,      Of one called Councillor of King David's line      Whose coming is foretold in words divine.      And now you come with words of mystery!  (_Muses._)       Why should thy questions, which are dark to me,      Cause me to think of Him?  GASPAR.      The star! The star!      No more it moves about the heavens afar,      It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray,      For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!  (_Hurries out right._)  DEBORAH.      His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within      And seek protection in my humble inn.  (_Exits right front._)  _After a short pause_, MELCHOIR, GASPAR _and_ BALTASAR _enter from rear right._  MELCHOIR.       Three kings came riding from far away,        Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar;      Three wise men out of the east were they,      And they traveled by night and they slept by day,        For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.  BALTASAR.       The star was so beautiful, large and clear,        That all other stars of the sky      Became a white mist in the atmosphere;      And by this they knew that the coming was near        Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.  GASPAR.       Of the child that is born, O Baltasar,        I begged a woman to tell us the news;      I said in the east we had seen His star,      And had ridden fast and had ridden far        To find and worship the King of the Jews.       --_Adapted from Longfellow._  MELCHOIR.      Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star      Is standing still over this lowly hut.  BALTASAR.      Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!  GASPAR (_knocks on the door of the manger_).      What ho, within!  JOSEPH _enters from the L. rear._  JOSEPH.      Sirs, whom seek ye?  MELCHOIR.      We have journeyed from afar      Led by the shining of yon splendid star.      We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.  BALTASAR.      We seek a new-born King,      Gold, frankincense to him we bring.      And many a kingly offering.  JOSEPH _draws back the curtain and reveals the interior of the manger._ MARY _is seen bending over the crib. The_ SHEPHERDS _are kneeling in the background. Very soft music heard in the distance, with faintly chiming bells at intervals._  GASPAR.      Behold, the child is clothed in light!  MELCHOIR.      Our journey ends, passed is the night.  BALTASAR.      Now let us make no more delay,      But worship Him right worthily.  (_They enter the manger and kneel._)  SIMEON.      Hail, hail, dear child      Of a maiden meek and mild.        See, he merries!      See, he smiles, my sweeting,      I give thee greeting!          Have a bob of cherries.  (_Places a spray of cherries on the crib._)  TIMOTHY.      Hail, little One we've sought,      See, a bird I've brought,          See its feathers gay.      Hail, little One adored,      Hail, blessed King and Lord,          Star of the day!  (_Places a bird on the crib._)  ISAAC.      Hail, little One, so dear,      My heart is full of cheer,          A little ball I bring,      Reach forth thy fingers gay,      And take the ball and play,          My blessed King.  (_Places a ball on the crib._)  _Enter all others from the Inn. They kneel outside the manger._  ALL (_sing, with concealed choir_).       CHRISTMAS CAROL.       (_See page 169_)       Christ was born on Christmas day,      Wreathe the holly, twine the bay,      Light and life and joy is He--          The Babe, the Son,          The Holy One            Of Mary.       He is born to set us free;      He is born our Lord to be;      Carol, Christians, joyfully;          The God, the Lord,          By all adored            Forever.       Let the bright red berries glow,      Everywhere in goodly show,      Life and light and joy is He,          The Babe, the Son,          The Holy One            Of Mary.       Christian men, rejoice and sing;      'Tis the birthday of our King,      Carol, Christians, joyfully;          The God, the Lord,          By all adored            Forever.  THE THREE KINGS.      Hail, King of Kings!  GASPAR.      I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings,      And here a scepter full of gems,      For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.  (_Places crown and scepter on crib._)  MELCHOIR.      For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!  (_He swings a smoking censor._)  BALTASAR.      And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!  (_Places casket on the crib._)  GASPAR.      The greatest gift is yet ungiven,      The gift that cometh straight from Heaven.          O, Heavenly King,          Heart's love we bring.  MELCHOIR.      Not gold nor gems from land or sea      Is worth the love we offer Thee.  BALTASAR.      And lowly folk who have no gold,      Nor gift to offer that is meet,      May bring the dearest thing of all--      A loving heart and service sweet.  (_All join in singing \"Joy to the World.\"_)  _Curtain falls._   THE WHITE CHRISTMAS.  WHAT IT MEANS.  How to make a pleasant, _helpful_ Christmas for the Sunday School is an annual problem. A tree with gifts, Santa Claus coming down the chimney, a treat of candy and nuts--these and many other schemes have been tried with a greater or less degree of success. But the criticism is often made that the true significance of the celebration of the birth of Christ is lost in the mere idea of bartering Christmas presents. \"She didn't give me anything last year, so I'm not going to give her anything this year.\"  One wise superintendent determined to teach his Sunday School pupils the precious lesson of the beauty of giving. He called his teachers together a few weeks before Christmas and proposed to eliminate entirely the idea of \"getting something,\" and in its stead to try to teach something of the true spirit of Christmas, the blessedness of giving.  The children were told that while at home they would receive all the usual presents, of course they would not get anything whatever from the Sunday School. The story of Jesus and how He gave His life, and how He liked best the gifts that cost us something, love, thought, foresight, charity, money--was told to the children and they were asked to save their pennies, instead of spending them for candy and nuts, to brighten the Christmas Day for God's poor and unfortunate.  It was put to a vote and every little hand was raised, although it may be confessed that a few went up a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],["title","The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#4)"],["body","eluctantly.  Teachers and young ladies met a few evenings later and made little stockings out of cheap cambric, with a cord put into the top of each in such a manner that it could be drawn together so the pennies would not be lost out. The stockings were about five inches long, and of various bright colors, and there were enough for every child. These were given out two weeks before Christmas.  On Christmas Eve, near the close of the regular program, a large tree was disclosed, but without a single present on it. The Minister made a short talk on the joys of giving to the poor and the children marched up, singing a Christmas carol, and attached their little stocking-bags to the tree.  Six little boys and girls passed among the congregation with larger stockings, collecting donations for the tree. These stockings had their tops neatly sewed around little circles of wire to keep them open.  The program consisted of Christmas hymns and carols, interspersed with recitations--all breathing the spirit of the White Christmas.   REMARKS ON THE PRODUCTION.  SCENERY.  Hang the rear and the sides of the stage with dark blue curtains, spangled with small silver bits of tinfoil, to represent very tiny stars. If the blue curtains are not available, use white sheets.  Cover the floor with white sheets. Have two or three small evergreen trees at rear, covered with white calcimine and diamond powder. Soak long rags, shaped like icicles, in a strong solution of alum, and then let them crystallize, then attach them to the trees.  [Illustration]  Down right, near the audience, is a doorway, supposed to be the entrance to the inn. This may be simply an opening between two wooden columns, with a step or two leading in. A lantern hangs over the door. A small bench stands by the inn.  Down left, near the audience, is the manger, a building extending out from left about seven feet. It has a back and one side of scenery or dark draperies and a thatched roof, covered with twigs or evergreen branches. There may be a door leading into the manger from the stage, but this is not necessary, as the characters can go out behind the manger. A front curtain, of dark goods, conceals the interior of the manger from the audience until it is withdrawn by Joseph.  The interior of the manger is covered with hay. Rude boxes and farm implements all around. A large upturned chair with wooden legs may simulate the crib, if it is concealed by enough straw. An electric light bulb is concealed in this straw and shines on the face of Mary, bending over the crib.  If desired, the manger scene may be presented in the choir loft, the manger hidden by curtains until revealed by Joseph. In this case have the evergreen trees at the left of the stage and arrange the manger scene at the rear and elevated above the other scene. This will prove most feasible in churches where the choir loft is immediately behind and above the platform.   LIGHTS.  Dim all the lights in the audience. Have a powerful searchlight, engine headlight or two powerful auto lights shining on the stage from a concealed elevation at the left. Shade these lights with a blue isinglass shield, thus casting a blue light over the entire stage. Use a strong yellow light on the manger scene, the rest of the stage being in darkness.   PROPERTIES.  If it is possible have bits of white confetti or finely cut paper fall from above during the shepherds' scene in Act II.  The bases of the trees should be covered with cotton.  Three rough crooks for the shepherds.  Chimes to ring off the stage. A dinner gong or set of chimes will answer.  For the lamb use a white muff, being careful to shield it from the direct gaze of the audience.  A spray of cherries.  A small bird of blue feathers.  A ball.  A crown and scepter made of gilded wood.  A censor made of metallic butter dish suspended by chains.  A fancy jewel case, supposed to contain myrrh.  Bench in front of inn.  Rude box in front of manger.   COSTUMES.  MARY--A sweet-faced blonde. Long tunic of light blue, falling straight from neck to the ankles. White stockings. Sandals. Hair in two long braids either side of face. White veil draped around head and shoulders, bound about the brow with circlet. Dark red mantle, fastened to left shoulder and draped around body. This mantle may trail on the ground. The tunic may be made of cotton crepon, the mantle of dyed muslin.  JOSEPH--A virile, bearded man of about fifty. Sandals. Long black cassock, easily obtained from an Episcopal choir. Striped couch cover may serve as mantle. This should be draped about head and body. Long staff.  SIMEON--An old man with white hair and beard. Tunic of potato sacking falling in straight folds from neck to ankles. Large gray shawl serves as mantle, draped on head and body. Long crook. Sandals.  TIMOTHY--Man of forty. Costume similar to Isaac's. Striped mantle.  ISAAC--Man of twenty. Shorter tunic similar to Simeon's. Fur rug draped over left shoulder. Dark red drapery on head. Sandals. Brown stripes criss-crossed on legs. Crook.  ANNA--Long tunic of brown. Take a square white sheet and stripe it with bands of dark blue. This serves as a mantle, draped over head and body. Hair hanging. A woman of thirty-five. Sandals. If desired, a blue veil may be draped around the head and neck and the mantle draped over the body.  THOMAS--A boy of seven. Sandals. Brown strips criss-crossed on legs from sandals to hips. Short white tunic cut like a boy's nightgown, but coming only to knees. Dark blue mantle. Small crook.  RUTH--A girl of eleven. Blue tunic hanging in straight folds from neck to three or four inches above ankles. Border of figured goods, to simulate oriental embroidery, around bottom of robe and down the front. This should be about two inches wide. Sandals. White stockings. Hair hanging. White veil draped around head and shoulders. Later she enters with striped mantle.  DEBORAH--A dignified matron of about forty-five. Sandals. Long kimono of solid color. Sash of yellow. Hair in two long braids on either side of face. Yellow drapery over head and shoulders. Rich striped mantle draped over the costume.  RACHEL--Sandals. White tunic trimmed with red figured cloth to simulate oriental embroidery. Red sash. Wreath of red roses on head. Mantle made of a square white sheet with stripes of red sewed on it. Bracelets, armlets and anklets of silver paper.  PRISCILLA--Sandals. Light green tunic. Dark green mantle. Gold paper armlets, etc.  MELCHOIR--Tall, dark man with dark mustache. Long black cassock may be borrowed from an Episcopal Church. Over this is a red or yellow kimono. Sandals. Turban on head. This turban may be made from a calico covered crown of an old derby, with red and white striped rim. He wears many rich ornaments. Curtain chains around neck and on arms. This costume may sometimes be borrowed from a lodge of Shriners, Knights Templar, Royal Arch Masons or Odd Fellows.  GASPAR--Similar to Melchoir. He is a young king aged about twenty-two. Wear white drapery on head and over it a golden (paper) crown. May wear sword. Sandals.  BALTASAR--Old king with white hair. Long rich robe or kimono over a cassock. Red sash. Red head drapery. Golden crown. Sandals.  ANGELS--Invisible to the audience.  PROLOGUE--Stately lady in trailing Grecian robe of white. Hair powdered. This character should be played by a lady with distinct dramatic ability.  NOTE.--If it is desired to simplify these costumes, kimonos, cassocks and cottas from Episcopal choirs, draperies of sheets and couch covers, and sandals made of a sole bound to foot with brown cloth cords, will answer admirably in the dim blue light.  Nightgowns, dressing gowns, fur rugs, fur muffs opened, fur stoles, opera capes, spangled tunics, window cords and chains, etc., will make valuable substitutes for the oriental garments.

It is the night before Christmas and the scene is on a big ocean-going vessel many miles out at sea. Down in the lower part of the ship, in the steerage, is a group of poor little immigrant children who are leaving the trials and troubles of the old world behind them and are looking forward to the golden promises held out by our own \"land of the free and the home of the brave.\" But the hearts of the little immigrants are sad. It is the night before Christmas, and how could Santa Claus ever hope to reach them away out in the middle of the ocean? Even the sleigh and the magical reindeers could never be expected to"]]]
