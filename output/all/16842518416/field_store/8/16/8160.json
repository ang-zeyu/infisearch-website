He is entirely dependent upon me. Out of my salary I have paid his expenses ever since I entered your employ.\"  \"That was generous and kind of you,\" said her husband, approvingly. \"What is the boy's name?\"  \"Nicholas Thorne.\"  \"Your brother's son, I suppose?\" said Mr. Kent.  \"Ye--es,\" she replied, hesitatingly.  \"What is his age?\"  \"Sixteen. He is about the same age as Jasper. Do I venture too much in asking you to become his friend?\"  Mrs. Kent modulated her voice, as she well knew how to do, to counterfeit warm and tender feeling, as she proffered this request. Her nature was feline, and she knew how to conceal her claws.  \"You may rely upon my co-operation, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, kindly, \"in your noble task.\"  There was a latent gleam of triumph in Mrs. Kent's eyes as she heard this promise, which transferred to her husband a burden which had long been a drain upon her own slender purse. She had dreaded the effect of this announcement upon her husband, and finally, as we have seen, thought it best to change the relationship and call Nicholas her nephew, and not her son. So that difficulty was well surmounted, and the effect had been to impress Mr. Kent with a sense of her generous and unselfish devotion.  But her exultation was short-lived. A bustle was heard outside. An instant later the door was thrown open, and Jasper entered the room, flushed and excited.     CHAPTER VI.  THE STEP-MOTHER.   \"Jasper!\" exclaimed his father, in surprise, but showing pleasure, nevertheless, at his son's unexpected presence.  The boy went straight up to his father, passing within two feet of his father's wife, but without even looking at her.  \"Father!\" he burst forth, impulsively, \"is it true?\"  \"Is what true?\" asked his father, embarrassed, for he guessed what Jasper meant.  \"Are you married--to her?\" pointing to Mrs. Kent, who looked indignant at the reference.  \"Yes, Jasper,\" answered his father, nervously. \"Shake hands with your--with Mrs. Kent.\"  He was about to say \"your mother,\" but something in his memory, perhaps something in his son's face, led him to change the expression.  Jasper did not apparently heed the suggestion. Instead, he said, reproachfully:  \"Why was it, father, that you left me in ignorance of your intention?\"  \"She thought it best,\" said his father, in an apologetic tone.  Mrs. Kent spoke for the first time.  \"Yes, Jasper, we thought it would only interrupt your studies.\"  Jasper could not help a slight sneer, as he answered:  \"You were very considerate, madam; but it seems to me that such an important event in my father's life would justify an interruption.\"  Mrs. Kent repressed her real feelings of anger and vexation, and answered mildly, and with an affectation of good humor:  \"I don't know but you are right, Jasper, and we were wrong. At any rate, since you have come it is a pity you were not here earlier, so that you could have been present at the ceremony. It was quite private, as your father can tell you.\"  \"Yes, Jasper, there were no invitations issued,\" said his father.  \"I wish that I had come earlier,\" said Jasper, slowly.  \"At any rate, now that you are here,\" said Mrs. Kent, with well-feigned cordiality, for it was politic to keep on good terms with Jasper, since he was his father's favorite, \"you will stay a day or two.\"  \"You forget, madam, the interruption to my studies,\" said Jasper.  \"I should like to wring the boy's neck,\" thought Mrs. Kent, her eyes contracting slightly, but she answered, amiably: \"I am afraid I have thought too much of that already. Let me make amends by welcoming you, and asking you to stay as long as you can.\"  Mr. Kent nodded approvingly at these words of his wife.  \"I ought not to complain,\" said Jasper, \"since you treated me no worse than you did your own son.\"  \"Nicholas has betrayed my secret!\" thought Mrs. Kent, turning pale.  \"What are you talking about, Jasper?\" demanded Mr. Kent, surprised. \"My wife has no son.\"  \"Jasper means my nephew,\" explained Mrs. Kent, recovering her assurance.  \"He said you were his mother,\" said Jasper.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Kent, with admirable composure, \"the poor boy has always looked upon me as a mother, though such is not our relationship. Indeed, I may say, orphan as he is, I have been a mother to him.\"  \"And it is very much to your credit, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, kindly. \"We must have him here on a visit. As Jasper's schoolmate, and your nephew, he shall be doubly welcome.\"  \"You are very kind, Mr. Kent,\" said his wife, in a tone which might well be mistaken for that of grateful emotion. \"It will, indeed, be a treat to my poor Nicholas to come here, even for a day.\"  \"He must spend his next vacation here, eh, Jasper? It will be pleasant for you to have a boy of your own age here.\"  \"Do as you like, father,\" said Jasper, who didn't care to say how distasteful the proposition was to him, or to explain the nature of the relations between Nicholas and himself.  Mrs. Kent looked at him sharply as he spoke, and understood better how he felt. But, as he did not openly object, she was satisfied. It was what she had wished to bring about, and she felt pleased that the proposal had come from Mr. Kent, and that Jasper had not spoken against it.  \"I will go and order your room to be made ready for you, Jasper,\" she said. \"You had better write to Dr. Benton that you will stay with us a day or two.\"  So saying, she left the room, and Jasper was left alone with his father.  \"Don't you like this marriage, Jasper?\" asked his father, anxiously, seeing that his son looked sober.  \"No, father,\" answered Jasper, frankly. \"I have not yet got over the shock of the first news.\"  \"You think I ought to have told you about it.\"  \"You are not accustomed to keep secrets from me, father.\"  \"I did it for the best, Jasper; I wanted to tell you, but she--Mrs. Kent--thought it best not.\"  \"I am afraid, father,\" said Jasper, sadly, \"it will not be the only time that she is destined to come between us.\"  \"No, Jasper,\" answered his father, with more energy than was usual with him, \"that shall not be. I am sure she would not wish it, and I know I wouldn't permit it. I hope, my dear boy, that you will become reconciled to the new state of things.\"  \"One thing would reconcile me to it,\" said Jasper.  \"What is it?\"  \"To be assured that it would promote your happiness.\"  \"I feel sure that it will,\" said Mr. Kent, but he did not speak very confidently.  \"If it be so, it is all I ask. But tell me, father, did you marry for love?\"  Mr. Kent hesitated.  \"I am too old for that, Jasper,\" he answered, pleasantly. \"The fact is, I need a nurse and Miss Thorne needed a home; and, in fact, without pretending to any sentimental reason, we concluded that it would be the best thing under the circumstances.\"  \"Was she very much surprised when you made the proposal, father?\" asked Jasper, significantly.  \"No, I can't say she was,\" answered his father, embarrassed.  \"It is as I thought,\" Jasper said to himself; \"she inveigled my father into the marriage.\"  He said aloud:  \"Well, father, I heartily hope it will be for your happiness; and now let us talk about something else. Shall I tell you about the school?\"  \"Yes, Jasper.\"  So Jasper gossiped about school matters in a way that interested his father, and the two forgot for a time that a new tie had been formed that might possibly make a difference between them.  Meanwhile Mrs. Kent, instead of giving directions about Jasper's room, opened her writing-desk and wrote a hurried note to Nicholas. In this she said:      \"Remember, Nicholas, you are to pass for my nephew. Why were you     so imprudent as to tell Jasper I was your mother? I have explained     that you regard me as a mother, though really my nephew. You must     give the same explanation. Jasper is at home now, not very well     pleased to find that he has a step-mother. But it is done, and he     will find it can't be undone. Be prudent, follow my directions     implicitly, and you will find it to your account.      \"Your devoted aunt,      \"Matilda Thorne Kent.      \"P.S.--I have told Mr. Kent about you, and he authorizes me to     invite you here to spend the next vacation.\"     CHAPTER VII.  NEW RELATIONS.   Jasper remained till the next afternoon. His father urged him to stay longer, and his step-mother, with apparent cordiality, seconded the invitation; but Jasper felt that the charm of home was gone. The new wife had stepped in between his father and himself. He felt sure that the marriage had not been of his father's seeking. To him it was no object. To the former governess it was a matter of importance, since it secured her a permanent home and position, and a share of Mr. Kent's property.  There was an old servant in the family, a trusty maid, who had been in it before Jasper was born. With her he could speak confidentially.  \"Tell me, Margaret,\" he asked, \"how came my father to marry Miss Thorne?\"  Margaret went to the door and looked out cautiously, then closed it.  \"I don't want her to hear what I say,\" she commenced, when convinced that they were in no danger of listeners, \"but it's my belief she asked your father to marry her.\"  \"Do you really believe that, Margaret?\"  \"Yes, I do, Master Jasper. She's that bold she wouldn't mind it, not a bit. Only she'd do it sly-like. I know just how she'd do it. She'd tell him how she hadn't got a home, and must go out into the wide world, and get him to pity her. Then, you know, he'd got used to seeing her round, and a sick man don't like changes.\"  \"Why couldn't she stay as governess to Florence?\"  \"According to her father's will Florence is to pass the next four years in the family of his sister, and she--that's her aunt--has a governess for her own children that'll do for Florence, too. So there wasn't no need of Miss Thorne"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19592"],["title","Frank and Fearless; or, The Fortunes of Jasper Kent (#5)"],["body","here any longer. Your father asked her to stay a while, till she could find another place. It's my belief she didn't try, being bent on staying here as the mistress. At any rate, she told your father she couldn't get a place, and he offered her the one she wanted, that of his wife.\"  \"How do you like her, Margaret?\" asked Jasper, thoughtfully.  \"Me like her! That's what I never did. She's like a cat--soft-spoken enough when she has her own way, but she's got claws, and you may depend she'll show 'em. I hope she won't do anything to harm you, Master Jasper.\"  \"Me!\" said Jasper, with the bold confidence of a boy, laughing at the thought. \"What can Mrs. Kent--a woman--do to injure me? I'll risk that, Margaret. It's of my father I'm thinking. Will she treat him well?\"  \"I think she will, for it's her object to, Master Jasper. She's married him for money, you know.\"  \"I don't mind her benefiting by my father's property, if she will make him comfortable during his life.\"  \"I think she will; she's too sly, and knows her own interest too well not to.\"  \"I'm glad you think that, Margaret. I shall feel better about it.\"            *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *  \"Then you don't think you can stay, Jasper?\" said Mrs. Kent, softly, when he announced his determination.  \"No, madam, I think I ought to be getting back to school.\"  \"Perhaps you are right. We shall miss you.\"  \"Yes, Jasper, we shall miss you,\" said his father.  \"I will write you often, father. If you are not feeling well at any time, write and let me know.\"  \"I will do so, Jasper,\" said his step-mother, promptly; \"but I shall have better news to write. Your father shall have the best of care.\"  \"Thank you, madam. If you can contribute to his comfort, you will place me under obligations to you.\"  \"As a wife, it will be my duty as well as my pleasure to do so,\" said Mrs. Kent.  Jasper bowed. The suggestion of the relationship always fell unpleasantly on his ears.  The carriage came round to take Jasper to the depot. His father and step-mother looked out of the front windows, and saw him off.  \"He is a noble, warm-hearted boy,\" said his father, warmly.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Kent, assenting, because it was expected.  \"Manly and high-spirited, too!\" added his father, in a tone full of affectionate admiration.  \"I'd like to break his spirit!\" thought Mrs. Kent, spitefully. \"Some time I may have the chance.\" Of course she didn't venture to say this. She only inquired, \"Were you like him at his age, Mr. Kent?\"  Mr. Kent smiled.  \"I won't flatter myself so far,\" he answered. \"Jasper is an improvement on the parent stock. I see in him more manliness and self-reliance than I possessed at his age.\"  \"May it not be parental partiality?\" asked Mrs. Kent, who by no means enjoyed hearing Jasper's praises.  \"No, I don't think so.\"  \"You must let me believe that it is your modesty then. Jasper may be a fine boy, but he will do well if he grows up as good a man as you.\"  \"Now you flatter me, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, smiling. \"You have too good an opinion of me.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" said Mrs. Kent to herself. \"I think you are an addle-headed old fool, but I won't say so.\"  Aloud she said, with a smile: \"My marrying you is a proof of my good opinion, Mr. Kent.\"  \"Thank you,\" said her husband, politely.  He was not a suspicious man--far from it--but even he knew that his wife only married him for a home and an establishment. But he never let his mind dwell on such things, and he quietly permitted his wife's assertion to go uncontradicted.            *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *  Meanwhile Jasper Kent had returned to his boarding-school. There was one who awaited his return with mingled curiosity and exultation.  This was Nicholas Thorne.  He had received his mother's letter, from which he learned, first, that her plan had succeeded, and she was now the wife of a rich man, and, secondly, that his own relationship to her must be changed in the eyes of the world.  \"I suppose mother knows what is best,\" he said to himself. \"So I'm to be her nephew, am I? Well, it's all one to me, as long as I fare the better for her good fortune.\"  For the moment it occurred to him that his mother might intend to throw him off--in a measure--but he quickly laid it aside. Bad as his mother was, she was yet devoted to him, and in so far was superior to him, for he cared for himself first and for no one second. The thought originated in his own base selfishness, and was laid aside only because he had received too many proof's of his mother's affection to doubt her.  When he heard that Jasper had got back he took pains to meet him.  \"Well, Kent,\" he said, with a show of intimacy which Jasper found very disagreeable, \"what news from home?\"  Jasper was about to reply abruptly, when it occurred to him that, after all, Nicholas had an interest in the matter.  \"I suppose you mean to ask if your mother is well?\" he said, eyeing Jasper keenly.  But Nicholas was on his guard. His mother's letter had cautioned him.  \"No, I don't,\" he answered, impudently. \"She is your mother, not mine.\"  \"My mother!\" exclaimed Jasper, coloring.  \"Yes, she's your father's wife, isn't she?\" said Thorne, with a leer.  \"Yes, but I acknowledge no such relationship as you suggest.\"  \"She's your step-mother, whatever you say.\"  \"I shall never call her so. You told me before I went that she was your mother.\"  \"I have always called her so, because I have known no other,\" said Thorne, composedly. \"She is really my aunt.\"  \"It must be true, then,\" thought Jasper. \"However, it is of little importance to me what the relationship may be.\"  \"I suppose this match makes us relations,\" said Thorne, smiling disagreeably.  \"I don't see that it does,\" said Jasper, coldly.  \"You'd rather it wouldn't, I suppose,\" sneered Thorne, provoked.  \"I don't know you well enough to desire so close a connection,\" said Jasper, in the same cold tone.  \"We shall know each other well enough some time,\" said Thorne, with something of menace in his tone.  Jasper turned on his heel and walked away.     CHAPTER VIII.  SUDDEN DEATH.   Two months later there was a vacation for a week. Nicholas expected to spend this with his mother, but for some reason Mrs. Kent gave him no invitation. Probably she thought that Nicholas, though a paragon in her eyes, was not likely to win favor in the eyes of Mr. Kent. His rough, brutal disposition would have repelled the sick man, who had become gentle in his enforced seclusion.  Thorne was disappointed, but his disappointment was softened by a timely remittance of ten dollars from his mother, which he spent partly in surreptitious games of billiards, partly in overloading his stomach with pastry and nearly making himself sick.  Jasper spent the week at home. His company was the source of great comfort and joy to his father, and this repaid him for the intrusion of his step-mother.  She treated him with politeness and apparent cordiality, but once or twice, when he chanced to look up unexpectedly, he detected her eyes fixed upon him with a glance that seemed to express detestation. On these occasions her expression changed instantly, and she addressed him in a soft, friendly voice.  All this puzzled him.  \"Does she hate me or not?\" he asked himself. \"I certainly don't like her. Still, I shall force myself to treat her politely as long as she treats my father well.\"  His father seldom spoke of his wife to his son, but sometimes Jasper noticed that he breathed a sigh of relief when she left the room, as if her presence had been a restraint upon him.  He didn't like to ask his father any question directly as to the relations between them. He hoped that at least they did not add to his father's discomfort.  At the end of the week Jasper was about to return to school.  \"How long before you have another vacation, Jasper?\" asked his father, wistfully.  \"Eleven weeks, father.\"  \"It seems a long time, Jasper.\"  \"I can come home during that time.\"  \"To my mind such interruptions of study are bad for a boy,\" said Mrs. Kent.  \"Perhaps they are,\" assented Mr. Kent, reluctantly.  \"I won't let them be an interruption, father,\" said Jasper. \"If you want me to come home, I will.\"  \"I hope, Jasper, you will understand my motive for speaking,\" said Mrs. Kent, softly. \"I should really be glad to see you, but sometimes we have to sacrifice our own inclinations--don't we, Mr. Kent?\"  \"Yes, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, listlessly.  And he turned his eyes once more to Jasper, who had his overcoat on and was waiting for the carriage to convey him to the depot.  \"Do you feel as well as usual, father?\" asked Jasper, anxiously.  \"Yes, I don't know but I do; perhaps a little more languid, but that is not unusual.\"  \"Well, good-bye, father. If you want to see me at any time, write a line, and I'll come at once.\"  \"Thank you, my dear boy. Don't overwork yourself at school.\"  There was a slight smile on Mrs. Kent's thin lips. Jasper noticed and mentally resented it. But the time had come for leave-taking, and he hurried away.  Six weeks passed. Jasper heard from home that his father was about the same, and this assurance relieved him of anxiety. Still, he made up his mind that he would spend the next Sunday at home. He would go on Saturday morning and come back on Monday morning, and he knew that his father would enjoy even this brief visit. But he was destined to go home quicker.  On Thursday afternoon a boy came up to the main entrance of Dr. Benton's school.  \"It's the boy from the telegraph office,\" said Wilder to Jasper.  \"I wonder whether he's got a message for the doctor or one of us boys?\" said Jasper, not suspecting that it was for himself.  \"I'll ask,\" said Wilder. \"Here, you, boy! who's your telegram for?\"  \"For Jasper Kent,\" said the boy. \"Will you call him?\"  \"I am he,\" said Jasper, hurrying forward, with pale face and beating heart, for a telegram always inspires fear.  \"Then here it is. Just sign the book,\""]]]
