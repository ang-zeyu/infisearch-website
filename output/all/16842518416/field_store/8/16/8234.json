At present, I'm in other employ.\"  \"And what was your object in bringing me here this evening?\"  \"One portion of my object has been accomplished. The other was to ask you to write out for me a copy of the note.\"  \"But who was it pursued us up Broadway?\"  \"Oh, I have rivals!\" he chuckled. \"I flatter myself that was rather neatly done. Will you give me a copy of the note, Mr. Lester?\"  \"No,\" I answered squarely. \"You'll have to go to the police for that. I'm out of the case.\"  He bowed across the table to me with a little laugh. As I looked at him, his imperturbable good humor touched me.  \"I'll tell you one thing, though,\" I added. \"The writer of the note knew nothing of Rogers's color-blindness--you're off the scent there.\"  \"I am?\" he asked amazedly. \"Then how did _you_ know it, Mr. Lester?\"  \"I suppose you detectives would call it deduction--I deduced it.\"  He took a contemplative puff or two, as he looked at me.  \"Well,\" he exclaimed, at last, \"I must say that beats me! Deduced it! That was mighty clever.\"  Again I bowed my acknowledgments.  \"And that's all you can tell me?\" he added.  \"I'm afraid that's all.\"  \"Very well; thank you for that much,\" and he flicked the ashes from his cigar. \"Now, I fear that I must leave you. I've a good deal of work to do, and you've opened up a very interesting line of speculation. I assure you that I've passed a very pleasant evening. I hope you've not found it tiresome?\"  \"Quite the contrary,\" I said heartily. \"I've enjoyed myself immensely.\"  \"Then I'll ask one last favor. My cab is at the door. I've no further use for it, and I beg you'll drive home in it.\"  I saw that he really wished it.  \"Why, yes, certainly,\" I assented.  \"Thank you,\" he said.  He took me down to the door, called the cab, and shook hands with me warmly.  \"Good-by, Mr. Lester,\" he said. \"I'm glad of the chance to have met you. I'm not really such a mysterious individual--it's merely a trick of the trade. I hope we'll meet again some time.\"  \"So do I,\" I said, and meant it.  I saw him stand for a moment on the curb looking after us as we drove away, then he turned and ran rapidly up the steps of the Elevated.  The driver seemed in no hurry to get me home, and I had plenty of time to think over the events of the evening, but I could make nothing of them. What result he had achieved I could not imagine. And yet he had seemed satisfied. As to his theory, I could not but admit that it was an adroit one; even a masterly one--a better one, certainly, than I should have evolved unaided.  The cab drew up at my lodging and I sprang out, tipped the driver, and ran up the steps to the door. My landlady met me on the threshold.  \"Oh, Mr. Lester!\" she cried. \"Such a time as I've had this night! Every five minutes there's been somebody here looking for you, and there's a crowd of them up in your room now. I tried to put them out, but they wouldn't go!\"     CHAPTER VI  Godfrey's Panegyric   I was quite dazed for the moment.  \"A crowd of them in my room!\" I repeated. \"A crowd of whom, Mrs. Fitch?\"  \"A crowd of reporters! They've been worrying my life out. They seemed to think I had you hid somewhere. I hope you're not in trouble, Mr. Lester?\"  \"Not the least in the world, my dear madam,\" I laughed, and I breathed a long sigh of relief, for I had feared I know not what disaster. \"I'll soon finish with the reporters,\" and I went on up the stair.  Long before I reached my rooms, I heard the clatter of voices and caught the odor of various qualities of tobacco. They were lolling about over the furniture, telling stories, I suppose, and they greeted me with a cheer when I entered. They were such jovial fellows that it was quite impossible to feel angry with them--and besides, I knew that they were gentlemen, that they labored early and late at meager salaries, for the pure love of the work; that they were quick to scent fraud or trickery or unworthiness, and inexorable in exposing them; that they loved to do good anonymously, remaining utterly unknown save to the appreciative few behind the scenes. So I returned their greeting smilingly, and sat me down in a chair which one of them obligingly vacated for me.  \"Well?\" I began, looking about at them.  \"My dear Mr. Lester,\" said the one who had given me the chair, \"permit me to introduce myself as Rankin, of the _Planet_. These gentlemen,\" and he included them in a wide gesture, \"are my colleagues of the press. We've been anxiously awaiting you here in order that we may propound to you certain questions.\"  \"All right; fire away,\" I said.  \"First, we'd like to have your theory of the crime. Your work this afternoon convinced us that you know how to put two and two together, which is more than can be said for the ordinary mortal. The public will want to know your theory--the great public.\"  \"Oh, but I haven't any theory,\" I protested. \"Besides, I don't think the great public is especially interested in me. You see, gentlemen, I'm quite out of the case. When we cleared Miss Holladay, our connection with it ended.\"  \"But is Miss Holladay cleared?\" he persisted. \"Is it not quite conceivable that in those two hours she was absent from her carriage, she may have changed her gown, gone to her father's office, and then changed back again? In that case, would she not naturally have chosen a green gown, since she never wore green?\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" I cried. \"That's puerile. Either she would disguise herself effectually or not at all. I suppose if you were going to commit a capital crime, you would merely put on a high hat, because you never wear one! I'll tell you this much: I'm morally certain that Miss Holladay is quite innocent. So, I believe, is the district attorney.\"  \"But how about the note, Mr. Lester? What did it contain?\"  \"Oh, I can't tell you that, you know. It's none of my business.\"  \"But you ought to treat us all alike,\" he protested.  \"I do treat you all alike.\"  \"But didn't Godfrey get it out of you?\"  \"Godfrey?\" I repeated. \"Get it out of me?\"  He stared at me in astonishment.  \"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Lester,\" he questioned, \"that you haven't been spending the evening with Jim Godfrey, of the _Record_?\"  Then, in a flash, I understood, and as I looked at the rueful faces of the men gathered about me, I laughed until the tears came.  \"So it was you,\" I gasped, \"who chased us up Broadway?\"  He nodded.  \"Yes; but our horses weren't good enough. Where did he take you?\"  \"To the Studio--Sixth Avenue.\"  \"Of course!\" he cried, slapping his leg. \"We might have known. Boys, we'd better go back to Podunk.\"  \"Well, at least, Mr. Lester,\" spoke up another, \"you oughtn't to give Godfrey a scoop.\"  \"But I didn't give him a scoop. I didn't even know who he was.\"  \"Didn't you tell him what was in the note?\"  \"Not a word of it--I told him only one thing.\"  \"And what was that?\"  \"That the person who wrote the note didn't know that Rogers was color-blind. You are welcome to that statement, too. You see, I'm treating you all alike.\"  They stood about me, staring down at me, silent with astonishment.  \"But,\" I added, \"I think Godfrey suspects what was in the note.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, his theory fits it pretty closely.\"  \"His theory! What is his theory, Mr. Lester?\"  \"Oh, come,\" I laughed. \"That's telling. It's a good theory, too.\"  They looked at each other, and, I fancied, gnashed their teeth.  \"He seems a pretty clever fellow,\" I added, just to pile up the agony. \"I fancy you'll say so, too, when you see his theory in to-morrow's paper.\"  \"Clever!\" cried Rankin. \"Why, he's a very fiend of cleverness when it comes to a case of this kind. We're not in the same class with him. He's a fancy fellow--just the _Record_ kind. You're sure you didn't tell him anything else, Mr. Lester?\" he added anxiously. \"Godfrey's capable of getting a story out of a fence-post.\"  \"No, I'm quite sure I didn't tell him anything else. I only listened to his theory with great interest.\"  \"And assented to it?\"  \"I said I thought it plausible.\"  An electric shock seemed to run around the room.  \"That's it!\" cried Rankin. \"That's what he wanted. Now, it isn't his theory any more. It's yours. Oh, I can see his headlines! Won't you tell us what it was?\"  I looked up at him.  \"Now, frankly, Mr. Rankin,\" I asked, \"if you were in my place, would you tell?\"  He hesitated for a moment, and then held out his hand.  \"No,\" he said, as I took it. \"I shouldn't. Shake hands, sir; you're all right. Come on, boys, we might as well be going.\"  They filed out after him, and I heard them go singing up the street. Then I sank back into my chair and thought again of Godfrey's theory; it seemed to fit the case precisely, point by point--even--and I started at the thought--to Miss Holladay's reticence as to her whereabouts the afternoon before. The whole mystery lay plain before me. In some way, she had discovered the existence of her half-sister, had secured her address; she had gone to visit her and had found her away from home--it was probable, even, that the half-sister had written her, asking her to come--though, in that case, why had she not remained at home to receive her? At any rate, Miss Holladay had awaited her return, had noticed her agitation; had, perhaps, even seen certain marks of blood upon her. The news of her father's death had pointed all too clearly to what that agitation and those blood-spots meant. She had remained silent that she might not besmirch her father's name, and also, perhaps, that she might protect the other woman. I felt that I held in my hand the key to the whole problem.  Point by point--but what a snarl it was! That there would be a vigorous search for the other woman I could not doubt, but she had a long start and should easily escape. Yet, perhaps, she had not started--she must have remained in town, else how could that note have been sent to us? She had remained, then--but why?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19672"],["title","The Holladay Case: A Tale (#8)"],["body","she should feel any affection for Frances Holladay seemed absurd, and yet, how else explain the note?  I felt that I was getting tangled up in the snarl again--there seemed no limit to its intricacies; so, in very despair, I put the matter from me as completely as I could and went to bed.         *       *       *       *       *  The morning's _Record_ attested the truth of Rankin's prophecy. I had grown famous in a night: for Godfrey had, in a measure, made me responsible for his theory, describing me with a wealth of adjectives which I blush to remember, and which I have, even yet, not quite forgiven him. I smiled as I read the first lines:       A _Record_ representative had the pleasure, yesterday      evening, of dining with Mr. Warwick Lester, the      brilliant young attorney who achieved such a remarkable      victory before Coroner Goldberg yesterday afternoon, in      the hearing of the Holladay case, and, of course, took      occasion to discuss with him the latest developments of      this extraordinary crime. Mr. Lester agreed with the      _Record_ in a theory which is the only one that fits      the facts of the case, and completely and      satisfactorily explains all its ramifications.  The theory was then developed at great length and the article concluded with the statement that the _Record_ was assisting the police in a strenuous endeavor to find the guilty woman.  Now that the police knew in which quarter to spread their net, I had little doubt that she would soon be found, since she had tempted providence by remaining in town.  Mr. Graham and Mr. Royce were looking through the _Record_ article when I reached the office, and I explained to them how the alleged interview had been secured. They laughed together in appreciation of Godfrey's audacious enterprise.  \"It seems a pretty strong theory,\" said our senior. \"I'm inclined to believe it myself.\"  I pointed out how it explained Miss Holladay's reticence--her refusal to assist us in proving an alibi. Mr. Royce nodded.  \"Precisely. As Godfrey said, the theory touches every point of the case. According to the old police axiom, that proves it's the right one.\"     CHAPTER VII  Miss Holladay Becomes Capricious   The body of Hiram Holladay was placed beside that of his wife in his granite mausoleum at Woodlawn on the Sunday following his death; two days later, his will, which had been drawn up by Mr. Graham and deposited in the office safe, was read and duly admitted to probate. As was expected, he had left all his property, without condition or reserve, to his daughter Frances. There were a few bequests to old servants, Rogers receiving a handsome legacy; about half a million was given to various charities in which he had been interested during his life, and the remainder was placed at the absolute disposal of his daughter.  We found that his fortune had been over-estimated, as is usually the case with men whose wealth depends upon the fluctuations of the Street, but there still remained something over four millions for the girl--a pretty dowry. She told us at once that she wished to leave her affairs in our hands, and in financial matters would be guided entirely by our advice. Most of this business was conducted by our junior, and while, of course, he told me nothing, it was evident that Miss Holladay's kindly feelings toward him had suffered no diminution. The whole office was more or less conversant with the affair, and wished him success and happiness.  So a week or ten days passed. The utmost endeavor of newspapers and police had shed no new light on the tragedy, and for the great public it had passed into the background of the forgotten. But for me, at least, it remained of undiminished interest, and more than once I carefully reviewed its features to convince myself anew that our theory was the right one. Only one point occurred to me which would tend to prove it untrue. If there was an illegitimate daughter, the blow she had dealt her father had also deprived her of whatever income he had allowed her, or of any hope of income from him. So she had acted in her own despite--still, Godfrey's theory of sudden passion might explain this away. And then, again, Miss Holladay could probably be counted upon, her first grief past, to provide suitably for her sister. Granting this, the theory seemed to me quite impregnable.  One other thing puzzled me. How had this woman eluded the police? I knew that the French quarter had been ransacked for traces of her, wholly without success, and yet I felt that the search must have been misconducted, else some trace of her would surely have been discovered. Miss Holladay, of course, rigidly refused herself to all inquirers, and here, again, I found myself on the horns of a dilemma. Doubtless, she was very far from wishing the discovery of the guilty woman, and yet I felt that she must be discovered, if only for Miss Holladay's sake, in order to clear away the last vestige of the cloud that shadowed her.  Then came new developments with a startling rapidity. It was toward quitting time one afternoon that a clerk brought word into the inner office that there was a woman without who wished to see Mr. Royce at once. She had given no name, but our junior, who happened to be at leisure for the moment, directed that she be shown in. I recognized her in an instant, and so did he--it was Miss Holladay's maid. I saw, too, that her eyes were red with weeping, and as she sat down beside our junior's desk she began to cry afresh.  \"Why, what's the matter?\" he demanded. \"Nothing wrong with your mistress?\"  \"She aint my mistress any more,\" sobbed the girl. \"She discharged me this afternoon.\"  \"Discharged you!\" echoed our junior. \"Why, I thought she thought so much of you?\"  \"And so did I, sir, but she discharged me just the same.\"  \"But what for?\" persisted the other.  \"That's just what I don't know, sir; I begged and prayed her to tell me, but she wouldn't even see me. So I came down here. I thought maybe you could help me.\"  \"Well, let me hear about it just as it happened,\" said Mr. Royce soothingly. \"Perhaps I _can_ help you.\"  \"Oh, if you could, sir!\" she cried. \"You know, I thought the world and all of Miss Frances. I've been with her nearly eight years, and for her to go and treat me like this--why, it just breaks my heart, sir! I dressed her this afternoon about two o'clock, and she was as nice to me as ever--gave me a little brooch, sir, that she was tired of. Then she went out for a drive, and about an hour ago came back. I went right up to her room to undress her, and when I knocked, sir, a strange woman came to the door and said that Miss Frances had engaged her for her maid and wouldn't need me any more, and here was a month's wages. And while I stood there, sir, too dazed to move, she shut the door in my face. After I'd got over it a bit, I begged that I might see Miss Frances, if only to say good-by; but she wouldn't see me. She sent word that she wasn't feeling well, and wouldn't be disturbed.\"  Her sobs mastered her again and she stopped. I could see the look of amazement on our junior's face, and did not wonder at it. What sudden dislike could her mistress have conceived against this inoffensive and devoted creature?  \"You say this other maid was a stranger?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir; she'd never been in the house before, so far as I know. Miss Frances brought her back with her in the carriage.\"  \"And what sort of looking woman is she?\"  The girl hesitated.  \"She looked like a foreigner, sir,\" she said at last. \"A Frenchwoman, maybe, by the way she rolls her r's.\"  I pricked up my ears. The same thought occurred at that instant to both Mr. Royce and myself.  \"Does she resemble Miss Holladay?\" he asked quickly.  \"Miss Holladay? Oh, no, sir. She's much older--her hair's quite gray.\"  Well, certainly, Miss Holladay had the right to choose any maid she pleased, and to discharge any or all of her servants; and yet it seemed strangely unlike her to show such seeming injustice to anyone.  \"You say she sent down word that she was ill?\" said Mr. Royce, at last. \"Was she ill when you dressed her?\"  \"Why, sir,\" she answered slowly, \"I wouldn't exactly say she was ill, but she seemed troubled about something. I think she'd been crying. She's been crying a good deal, off and on, since her father died, poor thing,\" she added.  That would explain it, certainly; and yet grief for her father might not be the only cause of Frances Holladay's tears.  \"But she didn't seem vexed with you?\"  \"Oh, no, sir; she gave me a brooch, as I told you.\"  \"I fear I can't promise you anything,\" said Mr. Royce slowly, after a moment's thought. \"Of course, it's none of my business: for Miss Holladay must arrange her household to suit herself; yet, if you don't get back with your old mistress, I may, perhaps, be able to find you a position somewhere else. Suppose you come back in three or four days, and I'll see what I can do.\"  \"All right, sir; and thank you,\" she said, and left the office.  I had some work of my own to keep me busy that night, so devoted no thought to Frances Holladay and her affairs, but they were recalled to me with renewed force next morning.  \"Did you get Miss Holladay's signature to that conveyance?\" Mr. Graham chanced to ask his partner in the course of the morning.  \"No, sir,\" answered Mr. Royce, with just a trace of embarrassment. \"I called at the house last night, but she sent down word that she was too ill to see me or to transact any business.\"  \"Nothing serious, I hope?\" asked the other quickly.  \"No, sir; I think not. Just a trace of nervousness probably.\"  But when he called again at the house that evening, he received a similar message, supplemented with the news imparted by the butler, a servant of many years' standing in the family, that Miss Holladay had suddenly decided to leave the city and open her country place on Long Island. It was only the end of March, and so a full two months and more ahead of"]]]
