Use them to buy your civilian clothes and kit after your dismissal. Buy a few shares of some stock, too--the amount or value doesn't matter. Get a small insurance policy. Yes,\" seeing his son's questioning look, \"there's a reason.  \"After you get your clothing and things and have discarded your uniform, go rent a hotel room, then go to the Inter-Stellar bank and rent a safety deposit box. That's one of the first things you do in each city on any planet to which you may be sent on assignment. Now, here are two keys that fit box number 1044 in all the I-S banks. They are special master keys of our own designing. Box 1044 is used because of its nearness to those private booths, in the universal set-up all I-S banks use. That box is our means of confidential communication.  \"After you get into the vault ostensibly to get into your own box, use these to open box 1044. There's a little electronic gadget in each box 1044. When you want immediate service on anything you put into the box, press the red button on the mechanism. Go back a few hours later and it will have been attended to. So now, when you get into the bank, put a note there listing your hotel room number and also your new deposit key number. Come back in a couple of hours and you'll find a key that will have your box number stamped on it, but which will open both boxes. Then leave your old key and one of these in 1044, and carry the other and the new one.\"  \"Oh, I see. The stock and insurance policy in my own box are decoys, eh?\"  \"Right. You put all your reports in box 1044, and get your orders there. We all use 1044, so just sort through the envelopes for any with your name on them. The same key also locks the sound-proof and spyray-proof cubicle in the vault, so no one, not even another SS man, can interrupt you unless you want to let them in.\"  \"My own box for decoy; 1044 for service matters; key fits both boxes and cubicles; red button for quick service. Yes, sir.\"  \"When you get to a new city or planet, put your local address there as soon as feasible. That's your one sure contact. Also, in each box you'll find quite a lot of money at all times. You take what you need for expenses and get your salary that way. If your job calls for more than is in the box at any time, leave a request and press the red button. More will be brought immediately.\"  \"That's quite a trust, sir,\" Hanlon gulped. \"I hope I'll always use it wisely.\"  His father nodded and smiled. \"You will, Spence. We wouldn't have asked you to join us if we weren't sure. As your father, I'm mighty proud to have you for a son. As Assistant Chief of the SS, I feel sure you'll be a credit to us.  \"Now,\" all business again, \"a sleep instructor and some reels of the language and other information about Simonides Four will be delivered to your hotel room. Simonides Four is your first assignment. There's something fishy going on there we haven't been able to find out about, but we think you can get us some good leads.  \"Don't try to handle it alone--just get us information. And, son, use your talent for reading minds. I heard over the intercom all you said to Rogers, and while that wasn't the only reason you were asked into the SS, believe me, it will be tremendously important in your work with us--it'll help us where no other agent can get to first check station. And I have a feeling, too, that you'll develop both that and many other mental abilities once your mind starts to hit the ball. You'll find in this work every single talent and ability you can develop will be useful and needed.\"  \"Yes,\" Hanlon nodded slowly, \"I'm beginning to realize that. I'll practice a lot.\"  \"As for money, don't be niggardly--spend what you like and always carry quite a bit with you for emergencies. Live well, although not extravagantly unless the occasion of your work demands it. Not to save money, but to remain as inconspicuous as possible.\"  \"The Service has it all thought out, hasn't it?\" Admiration shone in the young lieutenant's eyes.  \"They've had a lot of years for it, Spence. Now, there's another means of contact, for cases of emergency. Get word to, or an interview with, any officer of the rank of Rear Admiral or above. The words 'Andromeda Seven' are the passwords to let him know who and what you are. Once you've made that contact, commandeer anything or any service needed to assist your work.\"  \"I understand, sir.\" Hanlon strained to review all this new knowledge quickly. Then, \"I'm sure I have it all. Get civilian kit; hotel room; stocks and insurance; deposit boxes--my own and 1044; sleep-learn Simonidean; 'Andromeda Seven'.\"  \"Correct. Now, you'll be interested in a little of the background of the Secret Service. It was John Snyder himself who organized it, shortly after the formation of the Snyder Patrol. He realized almost at once that such an unknown, undercover echelon would be a must. There's usually not more than two hundred of us. New members are taken in only as replacements, or when some Corpsman with a special ability, such as your mind-reading, is discovered.  \"We work anywhere throughout space when there's a need, but there are usually one or two of us on each planet of the Federation at all times. When not on any special assignment we keep busy on some planet not our original home, checking the background of cadets or especially-appointed government workers, guarding VIP's, and such other vital matters. But whatever we are, or whatever we are doing, we _are_ the Corps!  \"We are mighty proud of the fact that no SS man has ever betrayed his trust, even to save his life. Our work is dangerous in the extreme, but without exception we are all men with high mental ability--quick-thinking, clever, and unusually adept at getting out of scrapes.\" He grimaced mirthlessly. \"We learn that last mighty quick in this business ... if we last.  \"And to all of us, our dangerous, unadvertised, publicly unrecognized work is personally highly satisfying. We know we are the guardians of the peace of the Federation, even though we get no hero-worship from the populace who don't know we exist.\"  Hanlon nodded slowly, thoughtfully. \"One thing puzzles me, Dad. You and Admiral Rogers both spoke about how secret all this is, yet I was given the chance to back out after I knew about it.\"  His father grinned. \"Several have, over the years. They underwent treatment to erase that knowledge from their mind.\" He stood up and came around the desk to where his son had also risen. \"I may not see you again before you leave, Spence ... George, I mean,\" he smiled ruefully, then brightened. \"But the best of luck, son, and keep in mind that you have the honor of the finest body of men in the Universe in your keeping, and always try to be worthy of the trust.\"  \"I will, sir,\" gravely. \"It seems almost too much responsibility for a cub like me, and I'm scared. But I'll do my best.\"  \"Take it easy at first. Don't try too much, and don't put yourself in any more danger than you have to until you learn the ropes, which you will, faster than you may now think. On this assignment, all we ask is that you try to get us some leads we can work on.\"  \"Right! I don't want to conk out too soon, now. I've got a lot of living I want to do first, especially now I've got my dad back again. I sure hope we manage to see each other fairly often.\"  \"Oh, we undoubtedly will, except when one or the other of us is on a long job. We'll meet--somewhere--quite often.\"  \"About this assignment of mine, Dad. Can you give me any dope on it?\"  \"You'll get what any of us know, from the reels, and the latest development from the box when you're ready to start out. Oh, yes, I almost forgot. The paper we use is a digestible plastic, so make a meal off all orders and confidential communications you receive. The box always contains a supply for your reports or requests for specific information or assistance.\"  \"Saves money on feed bills, eh?\"  His father grinned appreciatively, then sobered. \"Make sure you understand each step you take first, and don't try to run until you know how to crawl. Well, safe flights, Spence.\"  \"Safe flights to you, too, Dad, always. And I want you to know I'm so glad to have all those horrible misunderstandings and hates cleared away.\"  \"I missed my boy, too. But 'vast rewards', you know.\"  With mixed sensations of high elation and worried fear, the swiftly-maturing young Corpsman walked slowly through the beautiful park that surrounded the great stainless-steel skyscraper that housed the cadets during their training period. His thoughts were as twisted as were the meandering paths and walks he trod so unseeingly.     Chapter 3   As Hanlon entered his dormitory room, his roommate looked up from his studies.  \"What'd the Big Brass Bull want, Han?\"  \"Huh?\" Hanlon snapped out of his abstraction and grinned. \"Nothing important. You'll be up soon. Just about our first assignments after graduation.\" He was thinking swiftly. \"... Uh, I get some extra instruction in piloting, and a chance at the controls.\"  \"Gee, I hope they let me work on codes.\"  Hanlon shrugged. \"They probably will, Dick. They try to fit us where we can do the most good, Rogers said.\" He picked up a book and sat down, apparently studying intently, and young Trowbridge resumed his own lessons.  Hanlon began practicing his mind-reading at every opportunity. At first he felt sure he would be caught at it, but quickly remembered that, as a child, his victims never suspected they were being mentally invaded unless he told them or acted carelessly upon information so gleaned.  Yet it had been his naive, boyish pride then, that had made him boast to his playmates of his ability, and prove it by telling them things he had learned about them. All that, naturally, got him into much trouble and not a few fights, and caused the loss of all his early boyhood friends. That was why he had quit using"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19660"],["title","Man of Many Minds (#3)"],["body"," wild talent and had been so determined never to do so again, as he had first told Admiral Rogers.  But now he realized he must use it with all the ability and skill he could acquire. For this mind-reading, whatever of it he could do, was decidedly his dish. The SS would be sure to hand him all the jobs where it might best get them what they needed--if he showed he could produce.  Yet with his present equipment Hanlon knew he could do little. As he had also told the commandant, he couldn't actually read anyone's mind to the extent of getting definite wording or specific information. But he could get quite clear sensory impressions that helped him deduce what the other person was thinking.  He had partially learned--and now practiced with all his abilities and gained knowledge and intellect to improve and perfect the technique--to gauge the other's looks, glances, facial expressions, muscle movements, sudden tensenesses, and so on. For those, together with the mood-impressions and bits of fleeting thoughts, enabled him to know almost to a certainty what the other was actually thinking at the observed time.  In the barracks, later that first evening, he got into a card game and concentrated on trying to win by this method. Nor was it consciously that he chose a game being played for low stakes--he just wouldn't have thought of trying to win large sums by such \"cheating\".  For some time he won consistently and easily. He couldn't know what cards his opponents held, by suit or number, but he could tell without any difficulty whether each of the other players felt he had a poor, medium or good hand. By playing his own accordingly, his wins were far greater than his losses. After an hour or so of play had proved he could do it, and had given him considerable practice, Hanlon closed his mind to their impressions. He now played his cards so recklessly he soon lost his winnings. Then he got out of the game on a plea of having to study.  The next morning during first class, the door opened and Admiral Rogers entered the classroom.  \"'Ten-shun!\" the teacher called, springing to his feet.  \"As you were. I want to borrow one of your young gentlemen for the day, Major. A VIP is in town, and we want to give him an aide.\" He looked about the room, as though to pick out a likely-looking candidate. \"How about Cadet Hanlon? Does he especially need today's lesson?\"  \"Oh, no, sir, he's one of our top students.\"  Admiral Rogers looked directly at Hanlon, who had risen to attention when his name was mentioned. \"In my office, in full dress uniform, on the double.\"  \"Dismiss, Hanlon,\" the instructor said, and the cadet ran out.  In Admiral Rogers' office ten minutes later, Hanlon received his instructions. \"Report to the Simonidean Embassy and put yourself at the disposal of Hector Abrams, First Secretary to the Simonidean Prime Minister. But first, hang this stuff on you. This dress sword is a little unusual--the scabbard is rounder than yours, but not noticeably so. It's really a blaster; the trigger is here on the handle as you grasp it. Put on these aide's aguillettes--the metal tips are police whistles. No,\" seeing Hanlon's questioning look, \"we don't expect any trouble today--these are just routine, for we like to be ready for emergencies.\"  Hanlon fastened the braided cords to his shoulder tabs, and belted on the twenty-inch-long blaster-sword. The admiral touched a switch on his desk and spoke into a microphone. \"My personal car to take Cadet Hanlon to the Simonidean Embassy, then return.\"  At the Embassy, Hanlon reported to the receptionist, and was shown with due deference into one of the private offices, where he was introduced to several men, among them the Secretary he was to accompany.  \"I have a number of errands to do today, but the first and most important is laying the cornerstone of our new Embassy building--this one is merely rented, you may know.\"  \"I am entirely at your disposal, sir,\" Hanlon saluted crisply, and fell into step just behind the portly statesman as he left the building.  They rode in an open car with a uniformed chauffeur, the others following in other cars. As they rode Hanlon probed the statesman's mind, but found only worry-tension, that he shrewdly guessed had to do with the coming speech, rather than with any thought of intrigue or illegal machination.  As they came into the Greek section of the city, their ride took on more and more the aspects of a parade, as the Simonidean was recognized.  Hanlon opened his mind wide and attempted to analyze the thought-sensations he received from the crowds. It was one of gaiety and good nature, and reminded him of the way his boyish mind interpreted the thoughts of holiday crowds at the circus, Fourth of July celebrations, picnics, and so on.  From the moment he first entered the Embassy, Hanlon had been probing with every iota of his ability, hoping he could find some lead to whatever it was that was bothering the Corps about Simonides, but had found nothing sinister or menacing, nor could he get any such sensations from the crowd.  But now he concentrated more on watching the increasingly denser throng of people, for the car was nearing their destination. The buildings along here were all bedecked with Simonidean and Greek-Terran flags, and there was now a continuous cheering from the populace. Abrams was standing in the back of the car now, smilingly acknowledging their plaudits by bowing to one side and the other.  Hanlon, sitting stiffly at attention, nevertheless kept his eyes darting here and there, watching as carefully as he could for any possible hostile demonstrations or menacing figures.  Arrived at the building site, Abrams was greeted by numerous dignitaries, and escorted with much pomp to the flag-bedecked stand, amid greater cheering from the assembled crowd.  The chairman of the occasion stepped to the public-address microphone, and raised his hands for silence. The band broke off in the middle of a number, the cheering from the huge throng gradually died down, and the ceremony got under way.  Hanlon, who had taken his post at one corner of the platform, paid scant attention to what was happening on it, as it neither interested him nor could he understand too much of it, even though he knew quite a bit of Greek. Again his eyes were busy continually looking all about the great crowd and the surroundings.  Nothing of note occurred until the chairman began introducing Abrams, and then hecklers in the crowd began shouting:  \"Freedom for the Greeks of Simonides!\"  \"Empires are out of date; let the people rule!\"  \"Demos forever!\"  These calls were few at first, but the men yelling them were leather-lunged. The chairman's face turned reddish, and he wavered a bit in his speech, then raised his own voice in an attempt to drown out the interruptions.  Others were now crying out, though still only a few, but in spite of their shouts the ceremonies continued, and Abrams, properly introduced, rose and began his prepared speech.  Hanlon, more alert than ever, could see local police shoving through the crowd, trying to apprehend and silence the hecklers. But from his vantage point Hanlon saw the latter shifting rapidly from place to place, partly to escape detection, he swiftly deduced, and partly to make it seem as though more and more people were joining in the demonstration.  In a side glance Hanlon saw that the Secretary was nettled at the disturbance, and his color was high although he bravely continued speaking. The great audience was largely paying attention to him, and must have found him interesting, from their frequent cheers.  Suddenly, at one side, there seemed to be a more determined demonstration, and Hanlon tore his gaze from it, remembering his instructor's words:  \"Disregard specific diversions in one spot! Let the police handle those--you must watch most carefully then for assassins!\"  Instantly he was more alert, more carefully scanning the whole scene before him, his eyes travelling forth and back.  A glint of reflected sunlight from a nearby roof jerked his eyes upward, and at what he saw, with one swift, smooth motion he drew his blaster-sword, sighted carefully, and pressed the trigger.  There was a crack of flame, and a gunman half-hidden behind a chimney screamed, half-rose, then, his body charred by the force of that blast, toppled from the roof into the street below, his rifle falling near him. Hanlon swivelled. \"Cover Abrams!\" his voice rang out commandingly, and he himself jumped in front of the Secretary while others on the platform sprang up to completely surround the Simonidean, and hide him from possible further danger.  Hanlon raised one of the tassel-whistles and blew a piercing blast. Now he could see several local policemen running toward the platform, and in moments Abrams, surrounded by an armed and alert escort, was hustled into a waiting police car, which sped back to the Embassy.  The Simonidean was white and shaking, upset by the episode.  \"Why?\" he kept asking, but no one had any answers. \"I'm not important enough for anyone to want to kill,\" Abrams shook his head. \"The people of Simonides like the empire status--why should anyone here on Terra object?\"  \"There's always crackpots in every crowd,\" a police captain said. \"We get riots like this one almost every time there's a public ceremony. Most of 'em're plain nuts--once in a while only is there one who feels he's got a real grievance, personal.\"  \"But with so many participating, this one looked planned,\" Hanlon objected. \"I was higher and watching, and I could see at least a dozen men shouting at the beginning, starting all at the same time, although a lot more took it up. It must have been a plot of some kind.\"  His mind was racing. Was this part of what he was being sent to Simonides to investigate? He had tried to probe the crowd minds, but there were so many conflicting thought-emanations, such a welter of sensations he wasn't able to isolate any"]]]
