Didn't I say so? I guess Pee-wee thinks he's stronger than he is. _I_ think he'd better be at home too and I'd rather he'd stay home, though it's mostly just because I want to be alone with you. Maybe it's selfish, but if it is I can't help it. I think sometimes a feller might do something selfish and make up for it some other way--maybe. But I don't think any feller's got a right to do something selfish and then call it a good turn. I don't believe a long hike would hurt Pee-wee. He's the best scout-pacer in your patrol. But I want to go alone with you and I'd just as soon tell Mary so. I suppose it would be selfish, but we'd just try to make up----\"  \"Oh, shut up, will you!\" snapped Roy. \"You get on my nerves, dragging along with your theories and things. _I_ don't care who goes or if anybody goes. And you can go home and sleep for all I care.\"  \"All right,\" said Tom, rising. \"I'd rather do that than stay here and fight. I don't see any use talking about whether it's a good turn to Pee-wee.\" (Roy ostentatiously busied himself with his packing and pretended not to hear.) \"I wasn't thinking about Pee-wee so much anyway. It's Mary Temple that I was thinking of. It would be a good turn to her, you can't deny that. Pee-wee Harris has got nothing to do with it--it's between you and me and Mary Temple.\"  \"You going home?\" Roy asked, coldly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, you and Pee-wee and Mary Temple can fix it up. I'm out of it.\"  He took a pad and began to write, while Tom lingered in the doorway of the tent, stolid, as he always was.  \"Wait and mail this for me, will you,\" said Roy. He wrote:  \"Dear Mary--Since you butted in Tom and I have decided that it would be best for Pee-wee to go with _him_ and I'll stay here. Anyway, that's what _I've_ decided. So you'll get your wish, all right, and I should worry.  \"ROY.\"  Tom took the sealed envelope, but paused irresolutely in the doorway. It was the first time that he and Roy had ever quarrelled.  \"What did you say to her?\" he asked.  \"Never mind what I said,\" Roy snapped. \"You'll get your wish.\"  \"I'd rather go alone with you,\" said Tom, simply. \"I told you that already. I'd rather see Pee-wee stay home. I care more for you,\" he said, hesitating a little, \"than for anyone else. But I vote to take Pee-wee because Mary wants--asks--us to. I wouldn't call it a good turn leaving him home, and you wouldn't either--only you're disappointed, same as I am. I wouldn't even call it much of a good turn taking him. We can never pay back Mary Temple. It would be like giving her a cent when we owed her a thousand. I got to do what I think is right--you--you made me a scout. I--I got to be thankful to you if I can see straight. It's--it's kind of--like a--like a trail--like,\" he blundered on. \"There can be trails in your mind, kind of. Once I chucked stones at Pee-wee and swiped Mary's ball. Now I want to take him along--a little bit for his sake, but mostly for hers. And I want to go alone with you for my own sake, because--because,\" he hesitated, \"because I want to be alone with you. But I got to hit the right trail--you taught me that----\"  \"Well, go ahead and hit it,\" said Roy, \"it's right outside the door.\"  Tom looked at him steadily for a few seconds as if he did not understand. You might have seen something out of the ordinary then in that stolid face. After a moment he turned and went down the hill and around the corner of the big bank building, passed Ching Woo's laundry, into which he had once thrown dirty barrel staves, picked his way through the mud of Barrel Alley and entered the door of the tenement where Mrs. O'Connor lived. He had not slept there for three nights. The sound of cats wailing and trucks rattling and babies crying was not much like the soughing of the wind in the elms up on the Blakeley lawn. But if you have hit the right trail and have a good conscience you can sleep, and Tom slept fairly well amid the din and uproar.     CHAPTER V  FIRST COUP OF THE MASCOT   Anyway, he slept better than Roy slept. All night long the leader of the Silver Foxes was haunted by that letter. The darkness, the breeze, the soothing music of crickets and locusts outside his little tent dissipated his anger, as the voices of nature are pretty sure to do, and made him see straight, to use Tom's phrase.  He thought of Tom making his lonely way back to Barrel Alley and going to bed there amid the very scenes which he had been so anxious to have him forget. He fancied him sitting on the edge of his cot in Mrs. O'Connor's stuffy dining room, reading his Scout Manual. He was always reading his Manual; he had it all marked up like a blazed trail. Roy got small consolation now from the fact that he had procured Tom's election. If Tom had been angry at him, his conscience would be easier now; but Tom seldom got mad.  In imagination he followed that letter to the Temple home. He saw it laid at Mary's place at the dining table. He saw her come dancing in to breakfast and pick it up and wave it gaily. He saw John Temple reading his paper at the head of the table and advising with Mary, who was his partner in the Temple Camp enterprise. He knew it was for her sake quite as much as for the scouts that Mr. Temple had made this splendid gift, and he knew (for he had dined at Grantley Square) just how father and daughter conferred together. Why, who was it but Mary that told John Temple there must be ten thousand wooden plates and goodness knows how many sanitary drinking cups? Mary had it all marked in the catalogues.  Roy pictured her as she opened the letter and read it,--that rude, selfish note. He wondered what she would say. And he wondered what John Temple would think. It would be such a surprise to her that poor little Pee-wee was not wanted.  In the morning Roy arose feeling very wretched after an all but sleepless night. He did not know what he should do that day. He might go up to Grantley Square and apologize, but you cannot, by apology, undo what is done.  While he was cooking his breakfast he thought of Pee-wee--Pee-wee who was always so gay and enthusiastic, who worshipped Roy, and who \"did not mind being jollied.\" He would be ashamed to face Pee-wee even if that redoubtable scout pacer were sublimely innocent of what had taken place.  At about noon he saw Tom coming up the lawn. He looked a little shamefaced as Tom came in and sat down without a word.  \"I--I was going to go down to see you,\" said Roy. \"I--I feel different now. I can see straight. I wish I hadn't----\"  \"I've got a letter for you,\" said Tom, disinterestedly. \"I was told to deliver it.\"  \"You--were you at Temple's?\"  \"There isn't any answer,\" said Tom, with his usual exasperating stolidness.  Roy hesitated a moment. Then, as one will take a dose of medicine quickly to have it over, he grasped the envelope, tore it open, and read:  \"Dear Mary--Since you butted in Tom and I have decided it would be best for Pee-wee to go with _him_ and I'll stay home. Anyway, that's what _I've_ decided. So you'll get your wish, all right, and I should worry.  \"ROY.\"  He looked up into Tom's almost expressionless countenance. \"Who--told--you to deliver it--Tom?\"  \"I told myself. You said you'd call the whole thing off for two cents. But you ought not to expect me to pay the two cents----\"  \"Didn't I put a stamp on it?\" said Roy, looking at the envelope.  \"If you want to put a stamp on it now,\" said Tom, \"I'll go and mail it for you--but I--I didn't feel I cared to trust you for two cents--over night.\"  Through glistening eyes Roy looked straight at Tom, but found no response in that dogged countenance. But he knew Tom, and knew what to expect from him. \"You old grouch,\" he shouted, running his hand through Tom's already tousled and rebellious hair. \"Why don't you laugh? So you wouldn't trust me for two cents, you old Elk skinflint, wouldn't you. Well, then, the letter doesn't get mailed, that's all, for I happen to have only one stamp left and that's going to Pee-wee Harris. Come on, get your wits to work now, and we'll send him the invitation in the form of a verse, what d'you say?\"  He gave Tom such a push that even he couldn't help laughing as he staggered against the tent-pole.  \"I'm no good at writing verse,\" said he.  \"Oh, but we'll jolly the life out of that kid when we get him away,\" said Roy.  It is a wise precept that where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise. Pee-wee Harris never dreamed of the discussion that had taken place as to his going, and he accepted the invitation with a glad heart.  On the momentous morning when the trio set forth upon their journey, Mary Temple, as glad as they, stood upon the steps at Grantley Square and waved them a last good-bye.  \"Don't forget,\" she called, \"we're coming up in the car in August to visit you and see the camp and that dreadful Jeb or Job or Jib or whatever you call him, who smokes a corn-cob pipe--ugh!\"  The last they saw of her was a girlish shrug of disgust at that strange personage out of the West about whom (largely for her benefit) Roy and others had circulated the most outlandish tales. Jeb Rushmore was already ensconced in the unfinished camp, and from the few letters which had come from him it was judged that his excursion east had not spoiled him. One of these missives had been addressed to _Mister John Temple_ and must have been a refreshing variation from the routine mail which awaited Mr. Temple each morning at the big granite bank. It read:      \"Thar's a crittur come here to paint names o' animiles on the cabin     doors. I told him friendly sich wuzn't wanted, likewise no numbers.     He see it were best ter go. Bein' you put up th' money I would say     polite and likewise explain ez how the skins uv animiles is propper     fur signs an' not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19522"],["title","Tom Slade at Temple Camp (#4)"],["body","bein' ez cabins is not railroad cars.\"  This is a fair sample of the letters which were received by Mr. Temple, by Mr. Ellsworth, and even at National Scout Headquarters, which Jeb Rushmore called \"the main ranch.\"  The idea of putting the skin of a silver fox, for instance, on the patrol's cabin instead of a painted caricature of that animal, took the boys by storm, and to them at least Jeb Rushmore became a very real character long before they ever met him. They felt that Jeb Rushmore had the right idea and they were thrilled at the tragic possibilities of that ominous sentence, \"He see it were best to go.\"  The whole troop was down at the boathouse to see the boys off. Tom and Roy wore old khaki trousers and faded shirts which had seen service in many a rough hike; their scarred duffel bags bore unmistakable signs of hard usage, but Pee-wee was resplendent in his full regalia, with his monogram burned in a complicated design into the polished leather of his brand new duffel bag. His \"trousseau,\" as the boys called it, was indeed as complete and accurate as was possible. Even the scout smile, which is not the least part of the scout make-up, was carried to a conspicuous extreme; he smiled all over; he was one vast smile.  \"Don't fall off any mountains, Pee-wee.\"  \"Be sure to take your smile off when you go to bed.\"  \"If you get tired, you can jump on a train.\"  \"Pee-wee, you look as if you were posing for animal crackers.\"  These were some of the flippant comments which were hurled at Pee-wee as the three, in Roy's canoe, glided from the float and up the river on the first stage of what was destined to be an adventurous journey.  The river, along whose lower reaches Bridgeboro was situated, had its source within a mile or two of the Hudson in the vicinity of Nyack. From the great city it was navigable by power craft as far as Bridgeboro and even above at full tide, but a mile or two above the boys' home town it narrowed to a mere creek, winding its erratic way through a beautiful country where intertwined and overarching boughs formed dim tunnels through which the canoeist passed with no sound but the swishing of his own paddle. The boys had never before canoed to the river's source, though it was one of the things they had always been meaning to do. It was a happy thought of Tom's to make it a part of their journey now and strike into the roads along the Hudson in that way.  \"Oh, crinkums, I'm crazy to see Jeb Rushmore, aren't you?\" said Pee-wee. \"I never thought I'd have a chance to go like this, I sure didn't! I never thought you'd want me.\"  \"We couldn't do without you, kiddo,\" said Roy, as he paddled. \"We wouldn't have any luck--you're our lucky penny.\"  \"Cracky, you could have knocked me down with a feather when I got that note. At first, I thought you must be jollying me--and even now it doesn't seem real.\"  The boys laughed. \"Well, here you are, kiddo,\" said Roy, \"so you see it's real enough.\"  \"Do you suppose we'll have any adventures?\"  \"Why, as the little boy said when he spilled the ink on the parlor carpet, 'that remains to be seen.' We won't side-step any, you can be sure of that.\"  \"There may be danger awaiting us,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Well, I only hope it'll wait till we get to it,\" Roy laughed. \"What do you say, kiddo, shall we hit it up for Nyack to-night or camp along the river?\"  They decided to paddle leisurely, ending their canoe trip next day. About dusk they made their camp on a steep, wooded shore, and with the flame of their campfire reflected in the rippling water, Roy cooked supper.  Pee-wee was supremely happy. It is doubtful if he had ever before been so happy.  \"There's one thing,\" said Tom, as he held the bacon over the flame. \"I'm going to do my first-class stunts before we get there.\"  \"And I'm going to do some tracking,\" said Roy; \"here you go, Pee-wee, here's a bacon sandwich--look out for the juice. This is what Daniel Boone used to eat.\" He handed Pee-wee a sizzling slice of bacon between two cakes of sweet chocolate!  \"Mmmmmmm,\" said Pee-wee, \"that's scrumptious! Gee, I never knew chocolate and bacon went so good together.\"  \"To-morrow for breakfast I'll give you a boiled egg stuffed with caraway seeds,\" said Roy.  \"Give him a Dan Beard omelet,\" said Tom.  \"What's that?\" asked Pee-wee, his two hands and his mouth running with greasy chocolate.  \"Salt codfish with whipped cream,\" answered Roy. \"Think you'd like it?\"  Pee-wee felt sure he would.  \"And there's one thing _I'm_ going to do,\" he said. \"Tom's going to finish his first-class stunts and you're going to do tracking. I'm going to----\"  \"Have another sandwich?\" interrupted Roy.  \"Sure. And there's one thing I'm going to do. I'm going to test some good turns. Gee, there isn't room enough to test 'em indoors.\"  \"Good for you,\" said Roy; \"but you'd better trot down to the river now and wash your face. You look like the end man in a minstrel show. Then come on back and we'll reel off some campfire yarns.\"  They sat late into the night, until their fire burned low and Roy realized, as he had never before realized, what good company Pee-wee was. They slept as only those know how to sleep who go camping, and early in the morning continued their journey along the upper and tortuous reaches of the narrowing river.  Early in the spring there had been a serious flood which had done much damage even down in Bridgeboro, and the three boys as they paddled carefully along were surprised at the havoc which had been wrought here on the upper river. Small buildings along the shore lay toppled over, boats were here and there marooned high and dry many yards from the shore, and the river was almost impassable in places from the obstructions of uprooted trees and other debris.  At about noon they reached a point where the stream petered out so that further navigation even by canoe was impossible; but they were already in the outskirts of West Nyack.  \"The next number on the program,\" said Roy, \"is to administer first aid to the canoe in the form of a burlap bandage. Pee-wee, you're appointed chairman of the grass committee--pick some grass and let's pad her up.\"  If you have never administered \"first aid\" to a canoe and \"padded it up\" for shipment, let me tell you that the scout way of doing it is to bind burlap loosely around it and to stuff this with grass or hay so that the iron hook which is so gently wielded by the expressman may not damage the hull.  Having thus prepared it for its more prosaic return journey by train, they left the boat on the shore and following a beaten path came presently into the very heart of the thriving metropolis of West Nyack.  \"I feel as if we were Lewis and Clarke, or somebody, arriving at an Indian village,\" said Pee-wee.  At the express office Roy arranged for the shipment of the canoe back to Bridgeboro, and then they started along the road toward Nyack. It was on this part of their journey that something happened which was destined materially to alter their program.  They had come into the main street of the village and were heading for the road which led to the Hudson when they came upon a little group of people looking amusedly up into an elm tree on the lawn of a stately residence. A little girl was standing beneath the tree in evident distress, occasionally wringing her hands as she looked fearfully up into the branches. Whatever was happening there was no joke to her, however funny it might be to the other onlookers.  \"What's the matter?\" Tom asked.  \"Bird up there,\" briefly answered the nearest bystander.  \"She'll never get it,\" said another.  \"Oh, now he's going away,\" cried the little girl in despair.  The contrast between her anxiety and the amusement of the others was marked. Every time she called to the bird it flitted to another limb, and every time the bird flitted she wrung her hands and cried. An empty cage upon a lawn bench told the story.  \"What's the matter?\" said Pee-wee, going to the child and seeking his information first-hand.  \"Oh, I'll never get him,\" she sobbed. \"He'll fly away in a minute and I'll never see him again.\"  Pee-wee looked up into the branches and after some difficulty succeeded in locating a little bird somewhat smaller than a robin and as green as the foliage amid which it was so heedlessly disporting.  \"I see him,\" said Pee-wee. \"Gee, don't you cry; we'll get him some way. We're scouts, we are, and we'll get him for you.\"  His reassuring words did not seem to comfort the girl. \"Oh, there he goes!\" she cried. \"Now he's going to fly away!\"  He did not fly away but merely flew to another limb and began to preen himself. For so small a bird he was attracting a great deal of notice in the world. Following Pee-wee's lead, others including Tom and Roy ventured upon the lawn, smiling and straining their eyes to follow the tantalizing movements of the little fugitive.  \"Of course,\" said Pee-wee to the girl, \"it would be easy enough to shin up that tree--that would be a cinch--anybody could do that--I mean any _feller_--of course, a girl couldn't; but I'd only frighten him away.\"  \"You'll never get him,\" said one man.  \"What kind of a bird is it?\" Tom asked.  \"It's a dwarf parrot,\" the girl sobbed, \"and I'll never get him--never!\"  \"You don't want to get discouraged,\" said Pee-wee. \"Gee, there's always some way.\"  The spectators evidently did not agree with him. Some of them remained about, smiling; others went away. The diminutive Pee-wee seemed to amuse them quite as much as the diminutive parrot, but all were agreed (as they continually remarked to each other) that the bird was a \"goner.\"  \"Is he tame?\" Roy asked.  \"He was _getting_ tame,\" the girl sobbed, \"and he was learning to say my name. My father would give a hundred dollars--Oh,\" she broke off, \"now he _is_ going away!\" She began to cry pitifully.  Pee-wee stood a moment thoughtfully. \"Have you got a garden hose?\" he presently asked.  \"Yes, but you're not going to squirt water at him,\" said the girl,"]]]
