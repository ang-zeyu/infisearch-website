But they had brought no solution, and in the long run had been forced to accept Doc's decision.  \"I'm not going to retire and hide,\" he'd told them, surprised at his own decision, but grimly determined. \"You need me and I need you. I'll move every day in hopes the Lobby police won't find me, but I won't quit.\"  Now he was packing the things he most needed and getting ready to move. The small bottles in which he was trying to grow his cultures would need warmth. He shoved them into an inner pocket, and began surveying what must be left.  He was heading for his tractor when another battered machine drove up. It had a girl of about fourteen, with tears streaming down her face. She held out a pleading hand, and her voice was scared. \"It's--it's mama!\"  \"Where?\"  \"Leibnitz.\"  Leibnitz was near enough. Doc started his tractor, motioning for the girl to lead the way. The little dwelling she led him to was at the edge of the village, looking more poverty-stricken than most.  Chris Ryan, and three of the Medical Lobby police were inside, waiting. The girl's mother was tied to the bed, with a collection of medical instruments laid out, but apparently the threat had been enough. No actual injury had been inflicted. Probably none had been intended seriously.  \"I knew you'd answer that kind of call,\" Chris said coldly.  He grinned sickly. They'd wasted no time. \"I hear it's more than you'll do, Chris. Congratulations! My patient died. You're lucky.\"  \"She was certainly dead when my men took her picture. The print shows the death grimace clearly.\"  \"Pretty. Frame it and keep it to comfort you when you feel lonely,\" he snapped.  She struck him across the mouth with the handle of her gun. Then she twisted out through the door quickly, heading for the tractor that had been camouflaged to look like those used by the villagers. The three police led him behind her.  A shout went up, and people began to rush onto the village street. But they were too late. By the time they reached Southport, Doc could see a trail of battered tractors behind, but there was nothing more the people could do. Chris had her evidence and her prisoner.         *       *       *       *       *  Judge Ben Wilson might have been Jake's brother. He was older and grayer, but the same expression lay on his face. He must have been the family black sheep, since his father had been president of Space Lobby. Instead of inheriting the position, Wilson had remained on Mars, safely out of the family's way.  He dropped the paper he was reading to frown at Chris. \"This the fellow?\"  She began formal charges, but he cut them off. \"Your lawyer already had all that drawn up. I've been expecting you, Doctor. Doctor! Hnnf! You'd do a lot better home somewhere raising a flock of babies. Well, young fellow--so you're Feldman. Okay, your trial comes up day after tomorrow. Be a shame to lock you in Southport jail, a man of your importance. We'll just keep you here in the pending-trial room. It's a lot more comfortable.\"  Chris had been boiling slowly, and now she seemed to blow her safety valve. \"Judge Wilson, your methods are your own business in local affairs. But this involves Earth Medical Lobby. I demand--\"  \"Tch, _tch_!\" The judge stared at her reprovingly. \"Young woman, you don't demand anything. This is Mars. If Space Lobby can stand me, I guess our friends over at Medical will have to. Or should I hold trial right now and find Feldman innocent for lack of evidence?\"  \"You wouldn't!\" Chris cried. Then her face sobered suddenly. \"I apologize. Medical is pleased to leave things in your hands, of course.\"  Wilson smiled. \"Court's closed for today. Doc, I'll show you your cell. It's right next to my study, so I'm heading there anyhow.\"  He began shucking his robe while Chris went out with the police, her voice sharp and continual.  The cell was both reasonably escape-proof and comfortable, Doc saw, and he tried to thank the judge.  But the old man waved it aside. \"Forget it. I just like to see that little termagant taken down. But don't count on my being soft. My methods may be a bit unusual--I always did like the courtroom scenes in the old books by that fellow Smith--but Space Lobby never had any reason to reverse my decisions. Anything you need?\"  \"Sure,\" Doc told him, grinning in spite of his bitterness. \"A good biology lab and an electron microscope.\"  \"Umm. How about a good optical mike and some stains? Just got them in on the last shipment. Figure they were meant for you anyhow, since Jake Mullens asked me to order them.\"  He went out and came back with the box almost at once. He snorted at Doc's incredulous thanks and moved off, his bedroom slippers slapping against the hard floor.  Doc stared after him. If he were a friend of Jake, willing to invent some excuse to get a microscope here ... but it didn't matter. Friend or foe, his death sentence would be equally fatal. And there were other things to be thought of now. The little microscope was an excellent one, though only a monocular.  Doc's hands trembled as he drew his cultures out and began making up a slide. The sun offered the best source of light near the window, and he adjusted the instrument. Something began to come into view, but too faintly to be really visible.  He remembered the stains, trying to recall his biology courses. More by luck than skill, his fourth try gave him results.  Under two thousand powers, he could just see details. There were dozens of cells in his impure culture, but only one seemed unfamiliar. It was a long, worm-like thing, sharpened at both ends, with the three separate nuclei that were typical of Martian life forms. Nearby were a host of little rodlike squiggles just too small to see clearly.  Martian life! No Martian bug had ever proved harmful to men. Yet this was no mutated cell or virus from Earth; it was a new disease, completely different from all others. It was one where all Earth's centuries of experience with bacteria would be valueless--the first Martian disease. Unless this was simply some accidental contamination of his culture, not common to the other samples. He worked on until the light was too faint before putting the microscope aside.  By the time the trial commenced, however, he was sure of the cause of the disease. It _was_ Martian. Crude as his cultures were, they had proved that.  The little courtroom was filled, mostly from the villages. Lou was there, along with others he had come to know. Then the sight of Jake caught Doc's eyes. The darned fool had no business there; he could get too closely mixed into the whole mess.  \"Court's in session,\" Wilson announced. \"Doc, you represented by counsel?\"  Jake's voice answered. \"Your Honor, I represent the defendant. I think you'll find my credentials in order.\"  Chris started to protest, but Wilson grinned. \"Never lost your standing in spite of that little fracas thirty years ago, so far as I know. But the police thought you were a witness when you came walking in. Figured you were giving up.\"  \"I never said so,\" Jake answered.  Chris was squirming angrily, but the florid man acting as counsel for Medical Lobby shook his head, bending over to whisper in her ear. He straightened. \"No objection to counsel for the defense. We recognize his credentials.\"  \"You're a fool, Matthews,\" the judge told him. \"Jake was smarter than half the rest of Legal Lobby before he went native. Still can tie your tail to a can. Okay, let's start things. I'm too old to dawdle.\"  Doc lost track of most of what happened. This was totally unlike anything on Earth, though it might have been in keeping with the general casualness of the villages. Maybe the ritualistic routine of the Lobbies was driving those who could resist to the opposite extreme.  Chris was the final witness. Matthews drew comment of Feldman's former crime from her, and Jake made no protest, though Wilson seemed to expect one. Then she began sewing his shroud. There wasn't a fact that managed to emerge without slanting, though technically correct. Jake sat quietly, smiling faintly, and making no protests.  He got up lazily to cross-examine Chris. \"Dr. Ryan, when Daniel Feldman was examined by the Captain of the _Navaho_ after arriving at Mars station, did you identify him then as having been Dr. Daniel Feldman?\"  She glanced at Matthews, who seemed puzzled but unconcerned. \"That's correct,\" she admitted. \"But--\"  \"And you later saw him delivered to the surface of Mars. Is that also correct?\" When she assented, Jake hesitated. Then he frowned. \"What did you do then? Did you report him or send anyone to look after him or anything like that?\"  \"Certainly not,\" she answered. \"He was no--\"  \"You did absolutely nothing about him after you identified him and saw him delivered here? You're quite sure of that?\"  \"I did nothing.\"  Jake stood quietly for a moment, then shrugged. \"No more questions.\"  Matthews finished things in a plea for the salvation of all humanity from the danger of such men as Daniel Feldman. He was looking smug, as was Chris.  Wilson turned to Jake. \"Has the defense anything to say?\"  \"A few things, Your Honor.\" Jake stood up, suddenly looking certain and pleased. \"We are happy to admit everything factual the Lobby had testified. Daniel Feldman performed a surgical operation on Harriet Lynn in the village of Einstein. But when has it been illegal for a member of the Medical profession to perform an operation, even with small chance of success, within an accepted area for such operation? There has been no evidence adduced that any crime or act of even unethical conduct was committed.\"  That brought Chris and Matthews to their feet. Wilson was relaxed again, looking as if he'd swallowed a whole cage of canaries. He banged his gavel down.  Jake picked up two ragged and dog-eared volumes from his table. \"Case of Harding vs. Southport, 2043, establishes that a Lobby is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19471"],["title","Badge of Infamy (#7)"],["body"," for any member on Mars. It is also responsible for informing the authorities of any criminal conduct on the part of its members or any former member known to it. Failure to report shall be considered an admission that the Lobby recognizes the member as one in good standing and accepts responsibility for that member's conduct.  \"At the time Daniel Feldman arrived, Dr. Christina Ryan was the highest appointed representative of Medical Lobby in Southport, with full authority. She identified Feldman as having been a doctor, without stipulating any change in status. She made no further report to any authority concerning Daniel Feldman's presence here. It seems obvious that Medical Lobby at Southport thereby accepted Daniel Feldman as a doctor in good standing for whose conduct the Lobby accepted full responsibility.\"  Wilson studied the book Jake held out, and nodded. \"Seems pretty clear-cut to me,\" he agreed, passing the book on to Matthews. \"There's still the charge that Dr. Feldman operated outside a hospital.\"  \"No reason he shouldn't,\" Jake said. He handed over the other volume. \"This is the charter for Medical Lobby on Mars. Medical Lobby agrees to perform all necessary surgical and medical services for the planet, though at the signing of this charter there was no hospital on Mars. Necessarily, Medical Lobby agreed to perform surgery outside of any hospital, then. But to make it plainer, there's a later paragraph--page 181--that defines each hospital zone as extending not less than three nor more than one hundred miles. Einstein is about one hundred and ten miles from the nearest hospital at Southport, so Einstein comes under the original charter provisions. Dr. Feldman was forced by charter provisions to protect the good name of his Lobby by undertaking any necessary surgery in Einstein.\"  He waited until Matthews had scanned that book, then took it back and began packing a big bag. Doc saw that his possessions and the microscope were already in the bag. The old man paid no attention to the arguments of Matthews before the bench.  Abruptly Wilson pounded his gavel. \"This court finds that Dr. Daniel Feldman is qualified to practice all the arts and skills of the medical profession on Mars and that he acted ethically in the performance of his duties in the case of the deceased Harriet Lynn,\" he ruled. \"The costs of the case shall be billed to Medical Lobby of Southport.\"  He took off his robe and moved rapidly toward his private quarters. Court was closed.  Doc got up shakily, not daring to believe fully what he had heard. He started toward Jake, trying to avoid bumping into Chris. But she would not be avoided. She stood in front of him, screaming accusations and threats that reminded him of the only fight they'd ever had during their brief marriage.  When she ran down, he finally met her eyes. \"You're a helluva doctor,\" he told her harshly. \"You spend all your time fighting me when there's a plague out there that may be worse than any disease we've ever known. Take a look at what lies under the black specks on your corpses. You'll find the first Martian disease. And maybe if you begin working on that now, you can learn to be a real doctor in time to do something about it. But I doubt it.\"  She fell back from him then. \"Research! You've been doing unauthorized research!\"  \"Prove it,\" he suggested. \"But you'd be a lot smarter to try some yourself, and to hell with your precious rules.\"  He followed Jake out to the tractor.  Surprisingly, the old man was sweating now. He shook his head at Doc's look, and his grin was uncertain.  \"Matthews is an incompetent,\" he said. \"They could have had you, Doc. That charter is so sloppy a man can prove anything by it, and building a hospital here did bring in Earth rules. Wilson went out on a limb in letting you go. But I guess we got away with it. Let's get out of here.\"  Doc climbed into the tractor more soberly. They had escaped this time. But there would be another time, and he was pretty sure that would be Chris' round. He had no intention of giving up his research.     VII  Plague   Dr. Feldman leaned back from his microscope and lighted another bracky weed. He glanced about the room and sighed wearily. Maybe he'd been better off when he had no friends and couldn't risk the safety of others in an effort to do research that was the highest crime on two worlds.  The evidence of his work was hidden thirty feet beyond his former laboratory in Jake's village, with a tunnel that led from another root-cellar. The theory was the old one that the best place to avoid discovery was where you had already been discovered. If their spies had identified his former hangout, they'd never expect to have him set up research nearby. It was a nice theory, but he wasn't sure of it.  Jake looked up from a cot where he'd been watching the improvised culture incubator. \"Stop tearing yourself to bits, Doc. We know the danger and we're still darned glad to have you here working on this.\"  \"I'm trying to put myself together into a whole man,\" Doc told him. \"But I seem to come out wholly a fool.\"  \"Yeah, sure. Sometimes it takes a fool to get things done; wise men wait too long for the right time. How's the bug hunt?\"  Doc grunted in disgust and swung back to the microscope. Then he gave up as his tired eyes refused to focus. \"Why don't you people revolt?\"  \"They tried it twice. But they were just a bunch of pariahs shipped here to live in peonage. They couldn't do much. The first time Earth cut off shipments and starved them. Next time the villages had the answer to that but the cities had to fight for Earth or starve, so they whipped us. And there's always the threat that Earth could send over unmanned war rockets loaded with fissionables.\"  \"So it's hopeless?\"  \"So nothing! The Lobbies are poisoning themselves, like cutting off Medical service until they cut themselves out of a job. It's just a matter of time. Go back to the bugs, Doc.\"  Doc sighed and reached for his notes. \"I wish I knew more Martian history. I've been wondering whether this bug may not have been what killed off the old Martians. Something had to do it, the way they disappeared. I wish I knew enough to make an investigation of those ruins out there.\"  \"Durwood!\" Jake had propped himself on an elbow, staring at Doc in surprise.  Doc scowled. \"Clive Durwood, you mean? The archeologist who dug up what little we know about the ruins?\"  \"Yeah, before he went back to Earth and started living off his lectures. He came here again three years ago and dropped dead in Edison on the way to some other ruins. Heart failure, they called it, though it was more like the two old farmers who ran themselves to death last month. I saw him when they buried him. His face looked funny, and I think he had those little specks, though I may remember wrong.\" He grimaced. \"Mars is tough, Doc; it has to be. Some of the plant seeds Durwood found in the ruins grew! Maybe your bugs waited a million years till we came along.\"  \"What about the farmers? Did they meet Durwood?\"  Jake nodded. \"Must have. He lived in their village most of the time.\"  Doc went through his notes. He'd asked for reports on all deaths, and he finally found the account. The two old men had been nervous and fidgety for weeks. They were twins, living by themselves, and nobody paid much attention. Then one morning both were seen running wildly in circles. The village managed to tie them up, but they died of exhaustion shortly after.  It wasn't a pretty picture. The disease might have an incubation period of nearly fifteen years, judging by the length of time it had taken to hit Durwood. It must spread from person to person during an early contagious stage, leaving widening circles behind Durwood and those first infected. When matured, any other sickness would set it off, with few symptoms of its own. But without help, it still killed its victims, apparently driving them madly toward frenzied physical effort.  He studied the culture on a slide again. He'd tried Koch's method to get a pure strain, splattering the bugs onto a native starchy root and plucking off individual colonies. About twenty specimens had been treated with every chemical he could find. So far he'd found a few things that seemed to stop their growth, but nothing that killed them, except stuff far too harsh to use in living tissue.  He had nearly forty cases of deaths that showed symptoms now, and he went back over them, looking for anything in common that went back ten to twenty years before death. There were no rashes nor blisters. A few had had apparent colds, but such were too common to mean anything.  Only one thing appeared, about fourteen years before their deaths. The people interviewed about the victims might be vague about most things, but they remembered the time when \"Jim had the jumping headache.\"  \"Jake,\" Doc called, \"what's jumping headache? Most people seem to have it some time or other, but I haven't run across a case of it.\"  \"Sure you have, Doc. Mamie Brander's little girl a few weeks ago. Feels like your pulse is going to rip your skull off, right here. Can't eat because chewing drives you crazy. Back of your head, neck and shoulders swell up for about a week. Then it goes away.\"  Then it goes away--for fourteen years, until it comes back to kill!  Doc stared at his charts in sudden horror. It was a new disease--thought to be some virus, but not considered dangerous. Selznik's migraine, according to medical usage; you treated it with hot pads and anodyne, and it went away easily enough.  He'd seen hundreds of such cases on Earth. There must be millions who had been hit by it. The patent-medicine branch of the Lobby had even brought out something called Nograine to use for self-treatment.  \"Something important?\" Jake wanted to know.  Feldman nodded. \"How much weight do you swing in other villages, Jake?\"  \"People sort of do me favors when I ask,\" Jake admitted. \"Like swiping those medical journals"]]]
