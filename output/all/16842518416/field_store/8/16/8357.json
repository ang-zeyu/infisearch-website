Then back home with the solemn Parade to sit among the condemned waiting for that superlative Gorge known as the Sunday Dinner.  While she was waiting, a male Friend dropped in.  His costume was a compromise between an English Actor and a hired Mourner.  On Week Days he sat at a Desk dictating Letters and saying that the Matter had been referred to the proper Department.  He looked at Loretta, so calm and cool and collected in her pious Raiment, and the Smile that he summoned was benevolent and almost patronizing.  \"I was wondering,\" said he.  \"I was wondering if a Girl like you ever gets tired of sitting around and doing nothing.\"  Loretta did not cackle.  She had read in a Book by a Yale Professor that Woman is not supposed to possess the Sense of Humor.  MORAL:  The Settlement Campaign is not getting to the real Workers.   THE NEW FABLE OF THE INTERMITTENT FUSSER  Once a grammar-school Rabbit, struggling from long Trousers toward his first brier-wood Pipe, had Growing Pains which he diagnosed as the pangs of True Love.  The Target was a dry-seasoned Fannie old enough to be his Godmother. She was a Post-Graduate who was keeping herself on Earth by running to the Drug-Store every few minutes.  The Eye-Brows were neatly blocked out by some Process unknown to the writer, and she had a Shape that could be revised ad lib.  An Expert would have Made her at a glance, but the Cub fell for the Scenery and Mechanical Effects.  He had sketched a little synopsis of the Future.  After waiting 8 years, until she had unpetaled into the perfect bloom of Womanhood and he was wearing a Full Beard, he would take her by the Long Glove and lead her off into Dreamland.  Just to show how one of those pinfeather Passions may be shunted onto a Siding and left among the Dog-Fennel, when the Subject of this Sketch was _aetat_ 22, he was picking them out of the Air in the Left Garden at the State University.  Fannie (she of the purchased Pallor) was thoroughly married to a Veterinary with the Drug Habit.  Soon after recovering from the Pip, known in Medical Parlance as the Spooney Infantum, he began to glory in the friendship of an incipient Amazon who wore a Blazer and walked like a Policeman.  She did not hamper her fibrous Physique with any excess Harness that might pinch when she essayed a full St. Andrew's Swipe with a wooden Club.  And she had one lower octave of Pipes, like a Brakeman on the Erie.  There comes a brief Period in the Veal Epoch of every Sentimental Tommy when the only real Cutie is one who can propel a Canoe and throw Overhand.  So Walter, such being the baptismal Handicap, often thought it would be Sweet Billiards to keep house with the she-Acrobat for 30 or 40 years, because when they were tired of sitting in the House they could go into the Front Yard and play Ketch.  He was just at the rickety Age when the Gams refuse to co-ordinate. Every time he sauntered carelessly across the porch at a Summer Hotel, he gave a correct Imitation of a troop of Cavalry going over a Wooden Bridge at full Gallop.  He had a way of backing into Potted Plants.  Each Morning was clouded by the task of picking out a Cravat that would be of the same Radio-Activity as his Socks.  And all through the waking hours he carried with him a faint and sickly Realization that his Parents did not understand him.  One day he stood before a kind-faced Registrar and matriculated. Branded as a regular Freshman, he went back to his little Den and put a news-stand Photo of Lillian Russell between two Pennants.  The whalebone Divinity in the Home Town passed out of his Life.  He told himself that he would be true to Miss Russell and all the other Members of her sprightly Profession.  The emotional side of his unfolding Nature began to nourish itself on Song Hits, and he slept each night with his Banjo folded tightly to his Bosom.  He became acquainted with a Sophomore who once sat near Trixie Friganza in a Parlor Car.  One night Alice Nielsen looked directly at the Box in which he was seated with the other Fraters of the Ippy Ki Yi.  In fact, his Life became crowded with tingling Experiences.  The collection of Cigarette Pictures made him acquainted with many Celebrities.  His intimacy with them grew apace as he developed a bookish appetite for Sunday Newspapers.  He danced with the local Chickadees, but all the time his Heart was far away, in the Dramatic Column.  Suddenly he found that he was an Upper Classman, to whom each Neophyte touched the Leaf of Lettuce balanced on top of the Head, ostensibly as a Cap.  He became endowed with the divine Right to hit himself on the Leg with a Walking Stick and sit on a hallowed Fence.  Simultaneous-like, he became conscious of the fact that the Footlight Favorites were no longer worthy of him.  He began to hold long and serious Conversaziones with the Sister of a Prof.  She was an aerial Performer who wore powerful Spectacles, in which any one standing before her could see an Image of himself, greatly reduced. She looked as if she had been sitting up all night, writing a History of Civilization.  Walter found himself uplifted every time they were left together in the Library.  Sometimes she took him up so high that he became dizzy.  He now began to prog as follows:  He and the Lady Emerson would be legally welded just after Commencement and spend the Honeymoon at some lively Chautauqua.  The grinding Wheels and raucous buying and selling of the Marts of Trade seemed faint and far away when he roamed through the Cloisters with Elfreda.  He was in the moulting Stage, and it seemed to him that Success in Life would consist of going about reeking of Culture.  A Degree looked bigger than a Dividend.  He never had heard tell of such a thing as a Coal-Bill or a Special Assessment for a Sewer.  The vision of Elfreda floated out through a Transom three days after he drew a Desk in the extensive Works owned by the Governor.  He was too busy keeping his Head above the Churning Waves to bother with Speculative Philosophy or write Letters studded with Latin Phrases, like Currants in an English Cake.  All the cringing Peons in the big Stockade hated him because he had a Drag.  It was up to him to deliver the Merchandise and demonstrate that he was a Human Being rather than a College Graduate.  In the meantime, the Spectators were hoping that he would Skid and go into the Fence.  He began to wear his Frat pin on his undershirt, and he had no time to frivol away on the fluffy Gender, because he expected to be sitting in the Directors' Room in a couple of years, talking it over with Henry C. Frick.  So he waved aside the Square Envelopes and allowed himself to be billed all over the Macaroon Circuit as a Woman-Hater.  Of course he girled in a conservative way, but he merely trailed.  He did not buzz, or throw himself at the fallen Handkerchief, or run to get the Wraps, or do any of the Stuff that marks the true and bounden Captive.  When he found himself in the cushioned Lair of a Feline, he would lean back in perfect Security, knowing that even if she exercised her entire repertoire of Wiles, she could not warm the Dead Heart nor stir into life the fallen Rose Leaves of Romance.  All the time she was spilling her familiar line of Chatter, he would look at her with an arid and patronizing Smile, such as the Harvard Man produces when he finds himself in immediate juxtaposition to some human Caterpillar from west of Pittsburgh.  Very often, when the registered Dolly Grays got together for a Bon-Bon Orgy, some one would say, \"Oh, Crickey, ain't he the regular Cynic?\" Another might suggest that he was hiding a great Sorrow, his whole Existence having been embittered by the faithlessness of some Creature. Then they would take a Vote and decide that he was a plain Mutt.  The Chauncey who refuses to reciprocate will excite more Conversation than a regular Union Lover, but it is Lucky for him that he does not hear all the Conversation.  Walter at the age of twenty-five thought he was too old and sedate to be a Diner-Out and Dancing Devil.  When he was 28, however, he had become Hep to the large and luminous Truth that the man who sits in his Lodgings reading Dumas may overlook many a Bet.  He noted on every Hand the nice-looking Boys who turned in about 10.40 and avoided the Pitfalls of Society, and most of them were pulling down as much as $14 a week.  He recalled what this humble Chronicler had said away back in 1899: \"Early to Bed and Early to Rise and you will meet very few of our Best People.\"  He looked over the Lay-Out and decided that it was just as easy to mingle with the Face Cards as to sleep in the Discards.  He saw many a Light Weight with a gilt sign exposed on Main Street and no Assets except a Suit with a Velvet Collar, a pair of indestructible dancing Legs, and just enough intellectual Acumen to stir Tea without spilling it.  So he decided to have a try at the Gay Life and worm his way into the Safety Deposit Vaults via the Parlor Route.  A worthy Resolve and one often taken.  If a Friend of the People can capitalize his Vocal Cords, why should not the little Brother of the Rich put his undying Nerve into the Market and get what he can on it?  The Captain of Finance is usually owned, Body and Soul, by the other Half of the Sketch.  She may be a head bell-ringer in the D. A. R. or the blue-pencil Queen of the Golden Pheasants, but in a vast majority of cases she has not the Looks to back up the Title.  Even the Buckingham Palace manner and the Arctic Front cannot buffalo the idle Spectator into overlooking the fact that she belongs to the genus Quince.  She may not be a Beaut, but it is She who stands at the main entrance to the Big Tent and tears off seat coupons.  Walter knew that if he wished to be mentioned all over town as a Sure- Enough, his passport to the Inner Circle of Hot Potatoes would have to be vised by Patroness No. 1.  He began to work in the Secret Service of the Chosen Few and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19813"],["title","Ade's Fables (#4)"],["body","First Aid to the Chaperons.  A Hard Life, say you?  Not a tall--not a tall.  He was entirely surrounded by Fairy Lamps and sweet-smelling Flowers. Life became a kaleidoscopic Aurora Borealis.  When the first Crash of Music came through the hothouse Palms, Walter would be out on the Waxen Floor with his hair in a Braid.  Through the long watches of the night he played Blonde against Brunette and then went home with his Time-Card bearing the official O. K..  He swam among the floating Hooks and side-stepped the Maternal Traps, until the compilers of Marital Statistics had his name in the list marked \"Nothing Doing.\"  The Dope on him seemed to be that he was Immune and Jinx-Proof.  After he led one of them back to a Divan and fed her an Ice it was a case of \"Good Night, Miss Mitchell.\"  Truly, a Bachelor flown with Insolence and Pride is the favorite Mark for the Bow-and-Arrow Kid.  For every weather-beaten Beau and Ballroom Veteran there is waiting somewhere in Ambuscade a keen little Diana with the right kind of Ammunition.  One night he went to a Small Dance in his regular Henry Miller suit and wearing a tired look around the Eyes.  He counted these minor Functions a dreadful Bore.  Over in a corner sat a half-portion Damosel who had come to town on a Visit.  Her name was Violet, and she looked the Part.  She didn't know who was running for President or what Miss Pankhurst said about Suffrage, but she had large belladonna Orbs, with Danger lurking in their limpid depths.  She was just at the Age when any girl who is not actually Deformed looks fair to middling, while the real Dinger, with the Tresses and the Complexion and the gleaming white Shoulders and the Parisian figure, is right there with a full equipment for breaking up Families.  Old Dare-Devil Dick, the Hero of 1000 Flirtations, was sitting out one of the Dances recently condemned by Press and Pulpit.  He became aware of the presence of something Feminine at his immediate right.  He took a cautious Look and beheld a timid Debutante, sparkling with the Dew and waiting to be plucked.  She gave him a frightened Smile and lamped him very slowly.  Suddenly he felt himself wafted away on a cloud of Purple Perfumery. She had put the Sign on him without lifting a Finger.  His friends tried to save him.  They demonstrated, with a Pencil and a Piece of Paper, that she was just an ordinary, everyday Baby Doll with a Second Reader intelligence and the Spiritual Caliber of a Humming Bird.  They proved that exactly the same kind were scattered through every Department Store, working for $6 a week.  When they got thorough knocking, he hurried over and told her everything and promised her that if she would marry him, not one of these Snakes would ever be permitted to enter the House.  He writhed on the Rug and said that if she didn't whisper that One Little Word, it would be a case of Satin Lining and Silver Handles for little Wallie.  She looked out the Window and yawned slightly and then said, \"Oh, very well.\"  He rode home standing up in a Taxicab, while she was showing the Maids a lozenge-shaped Ring that set him back 450 Bucks.  MORAL:  The higher they fly the harder they fall.   THE NEW FABLE OF THE SEARCH FOR CLIMATE  Once there was a Gentleman of the deepest dye who was all out of Kilter.  He felt like a list of Symptoms on the outside of a Dollar Bottle.  He looked like the Picture you see in the Almanac entitled, \"Before Taking.\"  When his Liver was at Perihelion, he had a Complexion suggesting an Alligator-Pear, and his Eye-Balls should have been taken out and burnished.  He could see little dirigible Balloons drifting about in all parts of the deep-blue Ether.  His Tummy told him that some one had moved in and was giving a Chafing-Dish Party.  Furthermore, a red-hot Awl had been inserted under each Shoulder Blade.  When every Tree was a Weeping Willow and the Sun went slinking behind a Cloud, his only definite Yearn was to crawl into a dark Cellar with Fungus on the Walls and do the Shuffle, after making a sarcastic Will that disinherited all Relatives and Friends.  This poor, stricken Gloomer had time-tabled himself all over the Universe, trying to close in on a Climate that would put him on his Feet and keep him Fit as a Fiddle.  He had de-luxed himself to remote Spots that were supplied with Steam Heat and French Cooking, together with Wines, Liquors, and Cigars, but no matter what the Altitude or the Relative Humidity, he felt discouraged every Morning when he awoke and remembered that presently he would have to rally his Vital Forces and walk all the way to the Tub.  It was too bad that a Clubman, so eminent Socially, should be thus shot to Rags and Fragments.  Could aught be more Piteous than to Witness a proud and haughty Income tottering along the Street, searching in vain for a Workingman's Appetite?  When one with a spending possibility of $2 a Minute is told by a Specialist to drink plenty of Hot Water, the Words seem almost Ironic.  His Operating Expenses kept running up, and yet it looked like sheer Waste to lavish so much Collateral on the upkeep of a Physical Swab.  To show you how he worked at recouping his Health, once he spent a whole Summer in Merrie England.  He had been told by a Globe-Trotter that One lodging within a mile of Trafalgar Square could hoist unlimited Scotch and yet sidestep the Day After.  The Explanation offered by members of the Royal Alcoholic Society is that the Moisture in the Atmosphere counterbalances or nullifies, so to speak, the interior Wetness.  Also, the normal state of Melancholy is such that even a case of Katzenjammer merely blends in with the surrounding Drabness.  He experimented sincerely with the Caledonian Cure, acquiring a rich sunset Glow, much affected by half-pay Majors and the elderly Toffs who ride in the Row.  He began to wear his Arteries on the outside, just like a true son of Albion.  This cherry-ripe Facial Tint proves that the Britisher is the most rugged Chap in the World--except when he is in Stockholm.  In fact, if the New York Duds worn by the Yank had been less of a Fit, and he could have schooled himself to look at a Herring without shuddering, he might have rung in as a Resident of the tight little Isle, for he was often Tight.  He learned to like the Smoky Taste and could even take it warm, but still he felt Rocky, and up to 3 P. M. was only about 30 per cent. Human.  One evening in a polite Pub he heard about the wonderful Vin Ordinaire of Sunny France.  He was told that the Peasants who irrigated themselves with a brunette Fluid resembling diluted Ink were husky as Beeves and simply staggering with Health.  So he went motoring in the Grape and Chateau District and played Claret both ways from the Middle.  Every time the Petrol chariot pulled up in front of a Brasserie, he would call for a Flagon of some rare old Vintage squeezed out the day before.  Then he would go riding at the rate of 82 Kilos an Hour, scooping up the Climate as he scooted along.  Notwithstanding all these brave Efforts to overtake Health, he would feel like a frost-nipped Rutabaga when the matutinal Chanticleer told him that another blue Dawn was sneaking over the Hills.  He began to figure himself a Candidate for a plain white Cot in the Nerve Garage, when he heard of the wonderful Air and Dietary Advantages of Germany.  It seemed that the Fatherland was becoming Commercially Supreme and of the greatest Military Importance because every Fritz kept himself saturated with the Essence of Munich.  He could see on the Post-Cards that each loyal subject of Wilhelm was plump and rosy, with Apple Cheeks and a well-defined Awning just below the Floating Ribs, and a Krug of dark Suds clutched in the right Mitt.  All the way from Duesseldorf to Wohlgebaum he played the Circuit of Gardens with nice clean Gravel on the Ground and Dill Pickles festooned among the Caraway Trees.  Every time the Military Band began to breathe a new Waltz he would have Otto bring a Tub of the Dark Brew and a Frankfurter about the size of a Sash Weight.  Between pulls he would suspire deeply, so as to get the full assistance of the Climate.  Sometimes he would feel that he was being benefitted.  Often at 9 P. M., before taking his final Schnitzel and passing gently into a state of Coma, he would get ready to renounce allegiance to all three of the Political Parties in the U. S. A. and grow one of those U-Shaped Mustaches.  Next Morning, like as not, he would emerge from beneath the Feather Tick and lean against the Porcelain Stove, wondering vaguely if he could live through the Day.  The very Treatment which developed large and coarse-grained Soldiers all through Schleswig-Holstein seemed to make this Son of Connecticut just about as gimpy as a wet Towel.  Undismayed by repeated Failures, he took some Advice, given in a Rathskeller, and went to a Mountain Resort famous for a certain brand of White Vinegar with a colored Landscape on the Label.  It was said that anyone becoming thoroughly acidulated with this noble Beverage would put a Feather into his Granulated Lid and begin to Yodel.  He sat among the snowy Peaks, entirely surrounded by the rarefied Atmosphere so highly boosted in the Hotel Circulars, sampling a tall bottle of every kind ending with \"heimer,\" and yet he didn't seem to get the Results.  At last he headed for the barbaric Region which an unkindly Fate had designated as Home, almost convinced that there was no Climate on the Map which would really adapt itself to all the intricate Peculiarities of his complicated Case.  Often he would be found in the Reception Room just next to the shake- down Parlor.  After reading a few pages in a popular Magazine dated two Years back, he would be admitted to the little inside Room, faintly perfumed with something other than New Mown Hay.  Here he would cower before the dollar-a-minute Specialist, who would apply a Dictograph to the Heart Region and then say \"You are all Run Down.\"  "]]]
