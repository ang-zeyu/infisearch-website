As these chimes die away in the distance a concealed choir is heard singing._)       O COME, COME, AWAY.       O come, come away      From labor now reposing,      Let busy care a while forbear;      O come, come away.  (_The front curtains are drawn, showing a winter street in Bethlehem. No one appears on the stage, but the choir continues singing outside at right front._)       Come, come, our social joys renew,      And thus where trust and friendship grew,      Let true hearts welcome you,      O come, come away.  RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _enter from the inn at right front, arm in arm. They go to the center, then to the rear of the stage, turn and face the inn, pause a moment or two, listening to the choir, and then go out at rear left. The choir continues:_       From toils and the cares      On which the day is closing,      The hour of eve brings sweet reprieve,      O come, come away.      O come where love will smile on thee,      And round its hearth will gladness be,      And time fly merrily,      O come, come away.  _While the choir is singing the last three lines of the song_, SIMEON _and_ ISAAC _enter from rear left, leaning on their shepherd's crooks. They pause at rear center and listen to the singing. When the song is finished the organ continues the same music softly._  SIMEON.      Make haste, my son, the hour is waxing late,      The night is cold, methinks our sheep await.  ISAAC.      Nay gran'ther, I would liefer tarry here.      The town is gay, the inns are full of cheer.  SIMEON (_points to rear right_).      But there our duty lies, the wind grows cold!      Come, let's away and put the sheep in fold.  (_Starts off right._)  ISAAC.      Nay, Simeon, wait! What means this crowd of men      And women here in peaceful Bethlehem?  SIMEON (_comes to him_).      Herod the King hath issued a decree      That each and all his subjects tax√®d be;      And every one who in this town saw light      Must here return and register tonight.      From all Judea, aye, from th' distant land,      Each Bethlehemite must come at his command.  ISAAC (_comes to the doorway of the inn and peers in_).      The town is full of people, great and small,      Each inn is crowded to its very wall.  SIMEON (_comes down center and takes his arm_).      But come, we're wasting time, 'tis very late.      Make haste, my son, I know the flocks await!  ISAAC.      Thou speakest true, though I would rather stay,      Our duty calls, so to the hills, away!  (_They go out at rear right._)  _The concealed choir repeats the first stanza of the song softly. After a slight pause_ DEBORAH _enters from the inn._  DEBORAH (_coming down to right front_).      My inn is crowded to the doors. The heat      Is stifling, but out here the air is sweet.  (_Looks upward._)       The bright stars twinkle with mysterious light,      Methinks there's something strange about the night.  _She sits on the bench in front of the inn._ TIMOTHY _enters from rear left._ DEBORAH _continues her soliloquy._       The air is still, the night is very cold,      The shepherds seek the hills to watch the fold.  (_Sees him._)  (TIMOTHY _goes out at rear R._)  DEBORAH.      Some strange, unearthly voice seems calling me,      Methinks this night portends great things to be.  _Enter_ RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _from rear right, then come down center and address the hostess._  RACHEL.      Hail, hostess of the inn, my cousin here      Hath lodgings at your inn. We'd seek its cheer.  DEBORAH (_rises_).      Enter within. My guests tonight are gay      And fain would turn this winter's night to day.  RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _enter the inn, followed by_ DEBORAH. _The organ music continues softly. After a slight pause enter_ ANNA _from rear left. She leads_ RUTH _and_ THOMAS _by the hand._  THOMAS (_at rear center_).      Oh, mother, hark! There's music in the inn!  ANNA.      'Tis not for us--their noise and merry din.  RUTH.      Our little town is crowded, joyous, gay.  THOMAS.      So many travelers came this way today.  RUTH.      The night is chill and cold, I much do fear      The little sheep will shiver by the mere.  ANNA.      Too cold it is for thee, I fear, in truth,      Return and get thy cloak, my little Ruth.      We'll wait for thee upon the little hill.  (_Points off R._)       But speed thy steps, the cold will work thee ill.  RUTH.      I'll fly, dear mother, like an arrow home.  (_Runs out at L._)  ANNA.      We must not tarry. Come, my Thomas, come!  (_She leads him out at rear R. There is a pause. The music changes to a mysterious plaintive air. The old German song, Holy Night, may be effectively introduced as an organ solo._)  _Enter from rear right,_ JOSEPH, _walking with a staff and supporting_ MARY.  MARY.      Here is a place, now I must rest awhile!      For many a league, for many a weary mile,      We've trudged along since break of day began.  JOSEPH.      'Tis true, and I'm an old and ancient man,      My joints are stiff, my bones are waxing old--      And the long night is bitter, bitter cold.      Here take my cloak and keep thee warm within,      And wait thee here while I search out an inn.  (_He wraps his cloak around her and seats her on the bench or stool in front of the manger. He goes out at rear left. The music changes to the Magnificat, to be found in all Episcopal hymnals._)  MARY (_sings_).      My soul doth magnify the Lord: and my spirit hath rejoiced in God        my Saviour.      For he hath regarded: the lowliness of his handmaiden.      For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.      For he that is mighty has magnified me: and holy is his Name.      And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.      He hath showed strength with his arm: he hath scattered the proud        in the imagination of their hearts.      He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the        humble and meek.      He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath        sent empty away.      He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel: as he        promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, forever.  _Enter_ JOSEPH _from rear L._  JOSEPH.      For hours I've trudged the street in fruitless quest,      Here is an inn, mayhap at last we'll rest.  _Enter_ DEBORAH _from the inn._  MARY.      Husband, I'm faint; I can no farther go.      Methinks I'll rest me here upon this loe.  (_Sits in front of the manger._)  JOSEPH (_assisting her_).      Have courage, Mary, here's the hostess here.  (_Comes to_ DEBORAH _at right._)       We'd lodge with thee tonight.  DEBORAH.      Alas, I fear      My inn is crowded to the very wall,      Soldiers and scribes, the rich, the great, the small!  JOSEPH.      Is there room for us? My wife is ill.  DEBORAH.      My heart is sad and it is not my will      To send you hence, but naught is left to do.      Perhaps some other inn will shelter you.  JOSEPH.      Alas, the other inns are all the same!  DEBORAH.      Never was seen the like in Bethlehem.  (_Laughter and noise at R._)       My guests are merry, hear their jovial din!  (_Goes to R._)       I pity you, there's no room at the inn.  (_Exits into the inn._)  MARY.      Our last hope gone! Now, what shall we do?      My strength is leaving!  (_Bows head._)  JOSEPH.      Would I could succor you.      I'll wrap thee warm. Now rest thee here a while.      We've traveled far, full many a weary mile.  _Enter_ RUTH _from rear L., hurrying along._  JOSEPH.      Maiden, I fain would stop thee in thy flight--      Can'st tell where we could lodge this winter night?  RUTH.      That inn is crowded. There's one upon the hill.  JOSEPH.      I've tried them all, my wife is very ill.  RUTH.      That little stable there upon the loe,  (_Points to L front._)       'Tis snug and warm. 'Twill shield thee from the snow.  MARY (_rises_).      God's blessing on thy little head, sweet child!      Come, Joseph, for the wind now waxes wild.  (_Exits L. front._)  (JOSEPH _leads her to exit L., then turns and looks off R._)  JOSEPH.       O little town of Bethlehem,        How still we see thee lie!      Above thy deep and dreamless sleep        The silent stars go by.      Yet in thy dark streets shineth  (_Turns toward manger._)         The everlasting Light;      The hopes and fears of all the years        Are met in thee tonight.  (RUTH _stands at rear C., watching him._)  _The curtains slowly fall._   Scene II: _Hymn by the congregation._       WHILE SHEPHERDS WATCHED THEIR FLOCKS.       While shepherds watched their flocks by night,        All seated on the ground.      The angel of the Lord came down,        And glory shone around,        And glory shone around.       \"Fear not,\" said he,--for mighty dread        Had seized their troubled mind,      \"Glad tidings of great joy I bring,         To you and all mankind,         To you and all mankind.\"       \"To you in David's town this day,         Is born of David's line,      The Saviour, who is Christ, the Lord,        And this shall be the sign,        And this shall be the sign.\"       \"The heav'nly babe you there shall find        To human view displayed,      All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,        And in a manger laid,        And in a manger laid.\"       Thus spake the seraph--and forthwith        Appeared a shining throng      Of angels, praising God, who thus        Addressed their joyful song,        Addressed their joyful song:--       \"All glory be to God on high,        And to the earth be peace;      Good will henceforth, from heav'n to men,        Begin and never cease,        Begin and never cease.\"  _The_ PROLOGUE _appears before the curtains and speaks._  PROLOGUE.       There's scarlet holly on the streets, and silver mistletoe;      The surging, jeweled, ragged crowds forever come and go.      And here a silken woman laughs, and there a beggar asks-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],["title","The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#2)"],["body","-      And, oh, the faces, tense of lip, like mad and mocking masks.      Who thinks of Bethlehem today, and one lone winter night?      Who knows that in a manger-bed there breathed a Child of Light?       There's fragrant scent of evergreen upon the chilling air;      There's tinsel tawdriness revealed beneath the sunlight's glare;      There's Want and Plenty, Greed and Pride--a hundred thousand souls,      And, oh, the weary eyes of them, like dull and sullen coals.        Who knows the town of Bethlehem, once gleamed beneath the star,        Whose wondrous light the shepherds saw watching their flocks afar?       And yet above the city streets, above the noise and whir,      There seems to come a fragrant breath of frankincense and myrrh.      I saw a woman, bent and wan, and on her face a light      The look that Mary might have worn that other Christmas night.        And as the little children passed, and one lad turned and smiled,        I saw within his wistful eyes the spirit of the Child.       --_Caroline Reynolds._  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.  And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.  And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. (_Exit_ PROLOGUE _at L._)  (_Soft chimes are heard. The_ SHEPHERDS, _accompanied by the concealed choir, are heard singing:_)       LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT       Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom,          Lead Thou me on!      The night is dark and I am far from home;          Lead Thou me on!      Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see      The distant scene; one step enough for me.  _As the_ SHEPHERDS _begin on the second stanza of the hymn, the curtains rise disclosing the same scene as before._ SIMEON, TIMOTHY _and_ ISAAC _discovered seated in a group at rear center, singing._ THOMAS _stands by his father._       So long Thy pow'r hath blest me, sure it still          Will lead me on      O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till          The night is gone,      And with the morn those angel faces smile      Which I have loved long since, and lost a-while.  SIMEON.      Methought I heard a whir of wings on high.  TIMOTHY.      I see naught save the snow and starry sky.  ISAAC.      We've come a long and mighty step today,      From o'er the frosty hills and far away.  THOMAS (_pointing over the manger_).      Look, father, dost thou see that shining star      That seems to stand above the town so far?      'Tis like a wondrous blossom on a stem,      And see, it ever shines o'er Bethlehem!  TIMOTHY.      A brighter star, I'm sure I never saw--      And perfect form, without a speck or flaw.  SIMEON.      A stranger star! It never shone before,      It standeth still above that stable door.  _Enter_ ANNA _and_ RUTH _from rear left._ ANNA _carries a little lamb._  ANNA (_joining the group_).      Look ye, I've found a little lamb new-born.  TIMOTHY.      Poor little beastie! Wrap him well and warm.  SIMEON.      An ill night to be born in, frost and snow,      Naught but cold skies above, cold earth below.      I marvel any little creature should be born      On such a night.  ANNA.      I found it all forlorn,      Crying beside its mother in the storm.  SIMEON (_comes down a little to right front_).      Hark, I thought I heard a sound of mighty wings!      Listen! Is it the winter sky that sings?  ISAAC (_with the group at rear center_).      Nay, gran'ther, I heard naught. You're old and gray      And weary with the miles you've walked today.  SIMEON.      At noon I met a man who tarried in the shade,      He led a mule, and riding it a maid--      A maiden with a face I'll ne'er forget,      A wondrous face, I seem to see it yet      Lit with an inward shining, as if God      Had set a lighted lamp within her soul.      Many have passed all day, but none like these,      And no face have I ever seen like hers.  TIMOTHY.      Belike the man and maid were strangers here,      And come to Bethlehem at the king's command.  RUTH (_comes down to_ SIMEON _and takes his hand_).      Methinks I met that very man and maid--      A maiden with such wondrous dove-like eyes,      I saw them near this place, all tired and worn,      Trudging about the town, seeking an inn.  SIMEON.      And did they find one?  RUTH.      Nay, not so!      For every inn was crowded to its doors.      Hard by Deborah's inn there is a little barn,      All full of cattle, oxen, cooing doves--      I showed it to them, and they went therein.  THOMAS (_standing at rear L. with_ ANNA).      Mother, that star! That wondrous, wondrous light,  (_Points up._)       It turns the night to day, it shines so bright      I am afraid! It cannot be that any star,      Only a star, can give so great a light.      It frightens me.  ANNA.      All things are strange tonight.      The very sheep are restless in their fold,      They watch the star and do not mind the cold.  SIMEON (_puts hand to right ear, bends toward right and listens_).      Again I heard a singing in the sky!  TIMOTHY.      You heard the tinkling bell of some stray sheep,      The night grows late, come let us all to sleep.  SIMEON.      Yea, all ye lie down and take your rest,      I'll keep the watch alone, this night is blest.  (_The others recline at the rear._)  ANNA (_comes to_ SIMEON).      Here, take the little sheep and keep it warm.  (_Lies down._)  SIMEON.      Poor little new-born beast, I'll guard from harm.      Again I marvel that you should be born      On such a night, poor little lamb forlorn.  (SIMEON _walks toward the manger with the sheep in his arms. The others sleep._)  The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.  (_Soft Music._)       Hark! There's music in the wind! And that strange light      There in the east, it brightens all the night!      I seem to hear again the whir of wings,      Awake, awake! It is an angel sings!  (_He arouses the others. They listen wonderingly, standing or reclining._)  VOICE (_an unseen soprano chants softly_).       Glory to God in the highest!          Fear not!      For behold I bring you glad tidings          Of great joy.      For unto you is born this day      In the city of David, a Saviour          Which is Christ, the Lord.      And this shall be the sign unto you:      Ye shall find the heavenly Babe      Wrapped in swaddling clothes,          Lying in a manger.      Glory to God in the highest,      And on earth peace,          Good will toward men!  TIMOTHY.      'Twas a fine voice, even as ever I heard.  ANNA.      The hills, as with lightning, shone at his word.  SIMEON.      He spoke of a Babe here in Bethlehem.      That betokens yon star!      Full glad would I be,      Might I kneel on my knee,      Some word to say to that Child.  TIMOTHY.      See! In the east there breaks the day.  ANNA.      Let us tarry no longer; away, then, away!  (ANNA _goes out at rear, behind the stable, with_ TIMOTHY, RUTH _and_ THOMAS.)  ISAAC.      Come, gran'ther, let us go and see this thing!  SIMEON.      But first get gifts to take the new-born King!      Glory to God in the highest,      And on earth peace,      Good will toward men.  (_They follow the others out at rear._)  _The curtains fall._   SCENE III: _Hymn by the congregation:_       HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SING.       Hark! The herald angels sing,      \"Glory to the new-born King!      Peace on earth, and mercy mild,      God and sinners reconciled.\"      Joyful, all ye nations, rise,      Join the triumph of the skies;      With th' angelic host proclaim,      \"Christ is born in Bethlehem.\"       Christ, by highest Heaven adored;      Christ, the everlasting Lord;      Late in time behold Him come,      Offspring of the favored one.      Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;      Hail th' incarnate Deity:      Pleased, as man with men to dwell,      Jesus, our Immanuel.       Hail! The Heav'n-born Prince of Peace!      Hail! The Son of Righteousness!      Light and life to all He brings,      Risen with healing in His wings.      Mild He lays His glory by,      Born that man no more may die:      Born to raise the sons of earth,      Born to give them second birth.  _Enter_ PROLOGUE _before the closed curtains._  PROLOGUE.  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.  When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had"]]]
