Hundreds of refugees with mule carts and wheelbarrows laden with their household goods, were leaving the town in anticipation of the German advance. They made a mournful procession as they passed out of the town along the south road with babies crying and children clamoring about the clumsy, overladen vehicles. He saw many boys in khaki here and there and it cheered and inspired him to know that his country was represented in the fighting. He had to pause in the street to let a company of them pass by on their way northward to the trench line and it did his heart good to hear their cheery laughter and typical American banter.  \"Got any cigarettes, kiddo?\" one called.  \"Where you going--north?\" asked another.  \"To the billets west of Montdidier,\" Tom answered. \"I'm for new service. I came from Toul sector.\"  \"Good-_night_! That's Sleepy Hollow over there.\"  From Compiegne he followed the road across the Aronde and up through Mery and Tricot into Le Cardonnois. The roads were full of Americans and as he passed a little company of them he called,  \"How far is ----?\" naming the village of his destination.  \"About two miles,\" one of them answered; \"straight north.\"  \"Tell 'em to give 'em Hell,\" another called.  This laconic utterance was the first intimation which Tom had that anything special was brewing in the neighborhood, and he answered with characteristic literalness, \"All right, I will.\"  The road northward from Le Cardonnois was through a hilly country, where there were few houses. About half a mile farther on he reached the junction of another road which appeared also to lead northward, verging slightly in an easterly direction. He had made so many turns that he was a little puzzled as to which was the true north road, so he stopped and took out the trusty little compass which he always carried, and held it in the glare of his headlight, thinking to verify his course. Undoubtedly the westward road was the one leading to his destination for as he walked a little way along the other road he found that it bent still more to the eastward and he believed that it must reach the French front after another mile or two.  As he looked again at the cheap, tin-encased compass he smiled a little ruefully, for it reminded him of Archibald Archer, with whom he had escaped from the prison camp in Germany and made his perilous flight through the Black Forest into Switzerland and to the American forces near Toul.  Archibald Archer! Where, in all that war-scourged country, was Archibald Archer now, Tom wondered. No doubt, chatting familiarly with generals and field marshals somewhere, in blithe disregard of dignity and authority; for he was a brazen youngster and an indefatigable souvenir hunter.  So vivid were Tom's thoughts of Archer that, being off his machine, he sat down by the roadside to eat the rations which his anxiety to reach his destination had deterred him from eating before.  \"That's just like him,\" he thought, holding the compass out so that it caught the subdued rays of his dimmed headlight; \"always marking things up, or whittling his initials or looking for souvenirs.\"  The particular specimen of Archer's handiwork which opened this train of reminiscence was part and parcel of the mischievous habit which apparently had begun very early in his career, when he renovated the habiliments of the heroes and statesmen in his school geography by pencilling high hats and sunbonnets on their honored heads and giving them flowing moustaches and frock coats.  In the prison camp from which they had escaped he had carved his initials on fence and shack, but his masterpiece was the conversion of the N on this same glassless compass into a very presentable S (though turned sideways) and the S into a very presentable N.  The occasion of his doing this was a singular experience the two boys had had in their flight through Germany when, after being carried across a lake on a floating island while asleep, they had swum back and retraced their steps northward supposing that they were still going south.  \"Either we're wrong or the compass is wrong, Slady,\" the bewildered Archer had said, and he had forthwith altered the compass points before they discovered the explanation of their singular experience.  After reaching the American forces Archer had gone forth to more adventures and new glories in the transportation department, the line of his activities being between Paris and the coast, and Tom had seen him no more. He had given the compass to Tom as a \"souvenir,\" and Tom, whose sober nature had found much entertainment in Archer's sprightliness, had cherished it as such. It was useful sometimes, too, though he had to be careful always to remember that it was the \"wrong way round.\"  \"He'll turn up like a bad penny some day,\" he thought now, smiling a little. \"He said he'd bring me the clock from a Paris cathedral for a souvenir, and he'd change the twelve to twenty-two on it.\"  He remembered that he had asked Archer _what_ cathedral in Paris, and Archer had answered, \"The Cathedral de la Plaster of Paris.\"  \"He's a sketch,\" thought Tom.     CHAPTER FOUR  THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES   \"That's the way it is,\" thought Tom, \"you get to know fellers and like 'em, and then you get separated and you don't see 'em any more.\"  Perhaps he was the least bit homesick, coming into this new sector where all were strangers to him. In any event, as he sat there finishing his meal he fell to thinking of the past and of the \"fellers\" he had known. He had known a good many for despite his soberness there was something about him which people liked. Most of his friends had taken delight in jollying him and he was one of those boys who are always being nicknamed wherever they go. Over in the Toul sector they \"joshed\" and \"kidded\" him from morning till night but woe be to you if you had sought to harm him!  He had been sorry, in a way, to leave the Toul sector, just as he had been sorry to leave Bridgeboro when he got his first job on a ship. \"That's one thing fellers can't understand,\" he thought, \"how you can be sorry about a thing and glad too. Girls understand better--I'll say that much for 'em, even though I--even though they never had much use for me----\"  He fell to thinking of the scout troop of which he had been a member away back in America, of Mr. Ellsworth, the scoutmaster, who had lifted him out of the gutter, and of Roy Blakeley who was always fooling, and Peewee Harris. Peewee must be quite a boy by now--not a tenderfootlet any more, as Roy had called him.  And then there was Rossie Bent who worked in the bank and who had run away the night before Registration Day, hoping to escape military service. Tom fell to thinking of him and of how he had traced him up to a lonely mountain top and made him go back and register just in time to escape disgrace and punishment.  \"He thought he was a coward till he got the uniform on,\" he thought. \"That's what makes the difference. I bet he's one of the bravest soldiers over here now. Funny if I should meet him. I always liked him anyway, even when people said he was conceited. Maybe he had a right to be. If girls liked me as much as they did him maybe _I'd_ be conceited. Anyway, I'd like to see him again, that's one sure thing.\"  When he had finished his meal he felt of his tires, gave his grease cup a turn, mounted his machine and was off to the north for whatever awaited him there, whether it be death or glory or just hard work; and to new friends whom he would meet and part with, who doubtless would \"josh\" him and make fun of his hair and tell him extravagant yarns and belittle and discredit his soberly and simply told \"adventures,\" and yet who would like him nevertheless.  \"That's the funny thing about some fellers,\" he thought, \"you never can tell whether they like you or not. Rossie used to say girls were hard to understand, but, gee, I think fellers are harder!\"  Swiftly and silently along the moonlit road he sped, the dispatch-rider who had come from the blue hills of Alsace across the war-scorched area into the din and fire and stenching suffocation and red-running streams of Picardy \"for service as required.\" Two miles behind the straining line he rode and parallel with it, straight northward, keeping his keen, steady eyes fixed upon the road for shell holes. Over to the east he could hear the thundering boom of artillery and once the air just above him seemed to buzz as if some mammoth wasp had passed. But he rode steadily, easily, without a tremor.  When he dismounted in front of headquarters at the little village of his destination his stolid face was grimy from his long ride and the dust of the blue Alsatian mountains mingled with the dust of devastated France upon his khaki uniform (which was proper and fitting) and his rebellious hair was streaky and matted and sprawled down over his frowning forehead.  A little group of soldiers gathered about him after he had given his paper to the commanding officer, for he had come a long way and they knew the nature of his present service if he did not. They watched him rather curiously, for it was not customary to bring a dispatch-rider from such a distance when there were others available in the neighborhood. He was the second sensation of that memorable night, for scarcely two hours before General Pershing himself had arrived and he was at that very minute in conference with other officers in the little red brick cottage. Even as the group of soldiers clustered about the rider, officers hurried in and out with maps, and one young fellow, an aviator apparently, suddenly emerged and hurried away.  \"What's going to be doing?\" Tom asked, taking notice of all these activities and speaking in his dull way.  Evidently the boys had already taken his measure and formulated their policy, for one answered,  \"Peace has been declared and they're trying to decide whether we'd better take Berlin or have it sent C.O.D.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19495"],["title","Tom Slade, Motorcycle Dispatch Bearer (#3)"],["body","\"A soldier I met a couple of miles back,\" said Tom, \"told me to tell you to give 'em Hell.\"  It was characteristic of him that although he never used profanity he delivered the soldier's message exactly as it had been given him.     CHAPTER FIVE  GETTING READY   Tom wheeled his machine over to a long brick cottage which stood flush with the road and attended to it with the same care and affection as a man might show a favorite horse. Then he sat down with several others on a long stone bench and waited.  There was something in the very air which told him that important matters were impending and though he believed that they had not expected him to arrive just at this time he wondered whether he might not be utilized now that he was here. So he sat quietly where he was, observant of everything, but asking no questions.  There was a continuous stream of officers entering and emerging from the headquarters opposite and twice within half an hour companies of soldiers were brought into formation and passed silently away along the dark road.  \"You'll be in Germany in a couple of hours,\" called a private sitting alongside Tom as some of them passed.  \"Cantigny isn't Germany,\" another said.  \"Sure it is,\" retorted a third; \"all the land they hold is German soil. Call us up when you get a chance,\" he added in a louder tone to the receding ranks.  \"Is Cantigny near here?\" Tom asked.  \"Just across the ditches.\"  \"Are we going to try to take it?\"  \"_Try_ to? We're going to wrap it up and bring it home.\"  Tom was going to ask the soldier if he thought there would be any chance for _him_, though he knew well enough that his business was behind the lines and that the most he could hope for was to carry the good news (if such it proved to be) still farther back, away from the fighting.  \"This is going to be the first offensive of your old Uncle Samuel and if we don't get the whole front page in the New York papers we'll be peeved,\" Tom's neighbor condescended to inform him.  Whatever Uncle Samuel was up to he was certainly very busy about it and very quiet. On the little village green which the cottage faced groups of officers talked earnestly.  An enormous spool on wheels, which in the darkness seemed a mile high, was rolled silently from somewhere or other, the wheels staked and bound to the ground, and braces were erected against it. Very little sound was made and there were no lights save in the houses, which seemed all to be swarming with soldiers. Not a civilian was to be seen. Several soldiers walked away from the big wheel and it moved around slowly like one of those gigantic passenger-carrying wheels in an amusement resort.  Presently some one remarked that Collie was in and there was a hurrying away--toward the rear of the village, as it seemed to Tom.  \"Who's Collie?\" he ventured to ask.  \"Collie? Oh, he's the Stormy Petrel; he's been piking around over the Fritzies' heads, I s'pose.\"  Evidently Collie, or the Stormy Petrel, was an aviator who had alighted somewhere about the village with some sort of a report.  \"Collie can't see in the daylight,\" his neighbor added; \"he and the Jersey Snipe have got Fritzie vexed. You going to run between here and the coast?\"  \"I don't know what I'm going to do,\" said Tom. \"I don't suppose I'll go over the top, I'd like to go to Cantigny.\"  \"Never mind, they'll bring it back to you. Did you know the old gent is here?\"  \"Pershing?\"  \"Yup. Going to run the show himself.\"  \"Are you going?\"  \"Not as far as I know. I was in the orchestra--front row--last week. Got a touch of trench fever.\"  \"D'you mean the front line trenches?\" Tom asked.  \"Yup. Oh, look at Bricky!\" he added suddenly. \"You carrying wire, Bricky? There's a target for a sniper for you--hair as red as----\"  \"Just stick around at the other end of it,\" interrupted \"Bricky\" as he passed, \"and listen to what you hear.\"  \"Here come the tanks,\" said Tom's neighbor, \"and there's the Jersey Snipe perched on the one over at the other end. Good-_night_, Fritzie!\"  The whole scene reminded Tom vaguely of the hasty, quiet picking up and departure of the circus in the night which, as a little boy, he had sat up to watch. There were the tanks, half a dozen of them (and he knew there were more elsewhere), covered with soldiers and waiting in the darkness like elephants. Troops were constantly departing, for the front trenches he supposed.  Though he had never yet been before the lines, his experience as a rider and his close touch with the fighting men had given him a pretty good military sense in the matter of geography--that is, he understood now without being told the geographical relation of one place to another in the immediate neighborhood. Dispatch-riders acquire this sort of extra sense very quickly and they come to have a knowledge of the lay of the land infinitely more accurate than that of the average private soldier.  Tom knew that this village, which was now the scene of hurried preparation and mysterious comings and goings, was directly behind the trench area. He knew that somewhere back of the village was the artillery, and he believed that the village of Cantigny stood in the same relation to the German trenches that this billet village stood to the Allied trenches; that is, that it was just behind the German lines and that the German artillery was still farther back. He had heard enough talk about trench warfare to know how the Americans intended to conduct this operation.  But he had never seen an offensive in preparation, either large or small, for there had been no American offensives--only raids, and of course he had not participated in these. It seemed to him that now, at last, he was drawn to the very threshold of active warfare only to be compelled to sit silent and gaze upon a scene every detail of which aroused his longing for action. The hurried consultation of officers, the rapid falling in line in the darkness, the clear brisk words of command, the quick mechanical response, the departure of one group after another, the thought of that aviator alighting behind the village, the sight of the great, ugly tanks and the big spool aroused his patriotism and his craving for adventure as nothing else had in all the months of his service. He was nearer to the trenches than ever before.  \"If you're riding to Clermont,\" he heard a soldier say, apparently to him, \"you'd better take the south road; turn out when you get to Airian. The other's full of shell holes from the old trench line.\"  \"Best way is to go down through Estrees and follow the road back across the old trench line,\" said another.  Tom listened absently. He knew he could find the best way, that was his business, but he did not want to go to Clermont. It seemed to him that he was always going away from the war while others were going toward it. While these boys were rushing forward he would be rushing backward. That was always the way.  \"There's a lot of skeletons in those old trenches. You can follow the ditches almost down to Paris.\"  \"They won't send him farther than Creil,\" another said. \"The wires are up all the way from Creil down.\"  \"You never can tell whether they'll stay up or not--not with this seventy-five mile bean-shooter Fritzie's playing with. Ever been to Paris, kid?\"  \"No, but I s'pose I'll be sent there now--maybe,\" Tom answered.  \"They'll keep you moving up this way, all right. You were picked for this sector--d'you know that?\"  \"I don't know why.\"  \"Don't get rattled easy--that's what I heard.\"  This was gratifying if it was true. Tom had not known why he had been sent so far and he had wondered.  Presently a Signal Corps captain came out of Headquarters, spoke briefly with two officers who were near the big wire spool, and then turned toward the bench on which Tom was sitting. His neighbors arose and saluted and he did the same.  \"Never been under fire, I suppose?\" said the captain, addressing Tom to his great surprise.  \"Not before the lines, I haven't. The machine I had before this one was knocked all out of shape by a shell. I was riding from Toul to----\"  \"All right,\" interrupted the captain somewhat impatiently. Tom was used to being interrupted in the midst of his sometimes rambling answers. He could never learn the good military rule of being brief and explicit. \"How do you feel about going over the top? You don't have to.\"  \"It's just what I was thinking about,\" said Tom eagerly. \"If you'd be willing, I'd like to.\"  \"Of course you'd be under fire. Care to volunteer? Emergency work.\"  \"Often I wished----\"  \"Care to volunteer?\"  \"Yes, sir, I do.\"  \"All right; go inside and get some sleep. They'll wake you up in about an hour. Machine in good shape?\"  This was nothing less than an insult. \"I always keep it in good shape,\" said Tom. \"I got extra----\"  \"All right. Go in and get some sleep; you haven't got long. The wire boys will take care of you.\"  He strode away and began to talk hurriedly with another man who showed him some papers and Tom watched him as one in a trance.  \"Now you're in for it, kiddo,\" he heard some one say.  \"R. I. P. for yours,\" volunteered another.  Tom knew well enough what R. I. P. meant. Often in his lonely night rides through the towns close to the fighting he had seen it on row after row of rough, carved wooden crosses.  \"There won't be much _resting in peace_ to-night. How about it, Toul sector?\"  \"I didn't feel very sleepy, anyway,\" said Tom.  He slept upon one of the makeshift straw bunks on the stone floor of the cellar under the cottage. With the first streak of dawn he arose and went quietly out and sat on a powder keg under a small window, tore several pages out of his pocket blank-book and using his knee for a desk, wrote:      \"DEAR MARGARET:      \"Maybe you'll be surprised, kind of, to get a letter from me. And     maybe you won't like me calling you Margaret. I told Roy to show     you my letters, cause I knew he'd be going into Temple Camp     office on account of the troop getting ready to"]]]
