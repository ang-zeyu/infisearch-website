He had your mien, your eyes,           Spoke and could blush like you, when to the isle           Of Crete, my childhood's home, he cross'd the waves,           Worthy to win the love of Minos' daughters.           What were you doing then? Why did he gather           The flow'r of Greece, and leave Hippolytus?           Oh, why were you too young to have embark'd           On board the ship that brought thy sire to Crete?           At your hands would the monster then have perish'd,           Despite the windings of his vast retreat.           To guide your doubtful steps within the maze           My sister would have arm'd you with the clue.           But no, therein would Phaedra have forestall'd her,           Love would have first inspired me with the thought;           And I it would have been whose timely aid           Had taught you all the labyrinth's crooked ways.           What anxious care a life so dear had cost me!           No thread had satisfied your lover's fears:           I would myself have wish'd to lead the way,           And share the peril you were bound to face;           Phaedra with you would have explored the maze,           With you emerged in safety, or have perish'd.            HIPPOLYTUS           Gods! What is this I hear? Have you forgotten           That Theseus is my father and your husband?            PHAEDRA           Why should you fancy I have lost remembrance           Thereof, and am regardless of mine honour?            HIPPOLYTUS           Forgive me, Madam. With a blush I own           That I misconstrued words of innocence.           For very shame I cannot bear your sight           Longer. I go--            PHAEDRA           Ah! cruel Prince, too well           You understood me. I have said enough           To save you from mistake. I love. But think not           That at the moment when I love you most           I do not feel my guilt; no weak compliance           Has fed the poison that infects my brain.           The ill-starr'd object of celestial vengeance,           I am not so detestable to you           As to myself. The gods will bear me witness,           Who have within my veins kindled this fire,           The gods, who take a barbarous delight           In leading a poor mortal's heart astray.           Do you yourself recall to mind the past:           'Twas not enough for me to fly, I chased you           Out of the country, wishing to appear           Inhuman, odious; to resist you better,           I sought to make you hate me. All in vain!           Hating me more I loved you none the less:           New charms were lent to you by your misfortunes.           I have been drown'd in tears, and scorch'd by fire;           Your own eyes might convince you of the truth,           If for one moment you could look at me.           What is't I say? Think you this vile confession           That I have made is what I meant to utter?           Not daring to betray a son for whom           I trembled, 'twas to beg you not to hate him           I came. Weak purpose of a heart too full           Of love for you to speak of aught besides!           Take your revenge, punish my odious passion;           Prove yourself worthy of your valiant sire,           And rid the world of an offensive monster!           Does Theseus' widow dare to love his son?           The frightful monster! Let her not escape you!           Here is my heart. This is the place to strike.           Already prompt to expiate its guilt,           I feel it leap impatiently to meet           Your arm. Strike home. Or, if it would disgrace you           To steep your hand in such polluted blood,           If that were punishment too mild to slake           Your hatred, lend me then your sword, if not           Your arm. Quick, give't.            OENONE           What, Madam, will you do?           Just gods! But someone comes. Go, fly from shame,           You cannot 'scape if seen by any thus.              SCENE VI           HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES             THERAMENES           Is that the form of Phaedra that I see           Hurried away? What mean these signs of sorrow?           Where is your sword? Why are you pale, confused?            HIPPOLYTUS           Friend, let us fly. I am, indeed, confounded           With horror and astonishment extreme.           Phaedra--but no; gods, let this dreadful secret           Remain for ever buried in oblivion.            THERAMENES           The ship is ready if you wish to sail.           But Athens has already giv'n her vote;           Their leaders have consulted all her tribes;           Your brother is elected, Phaedra wins.            HIPPOLYTUS           Phaedra?            THERAMENES           A herald, charged with a commission           From Athens, has arrived to place the reins           Of power in her hands. Her son is King.            HIPPOLYTUS           Ye gods, who know her, do ye thus reward           Her virtue?            THERAMENES           A faint rumour meanwhile whispers           That Theseus is not dead, but in Epirus           Has shown himself. But, after all my search,           I know too well--            HIPPOLYTUS           Let nothing be neglected.           This rumour must be traced back to its source.           If it be found unworthy of belief,           Let us set sail, and cost whate'er it may,           To hands deserving trust the sceptre's sway.     ACT III            Scene I           PHAEDRA, OENONE             PHAEDRA           Ah! Let them take elsewhere the worthless honours           They bring me. Why so urgent I should see them?           What flattering balm can soothe my wounded heart?           Far rather hide me: I have said too much.           My madness has burst forth like streams in flood,           And I have utter'd what should ne'er have reach'd           His ear. Gods! How he heard me! How reluctant           To catch my meaning, dull and cold as marble,           And eager only for a quick retreat!           How oft his blushes made my shame the deeper!           Why did you turn me from the death I sought?           Ah! When his sword was pointed to my bosom,           Did he grow pale, or try to snatch it from me?           That I had touch'd it was enough for him           To render it for ever horrible,           Leaving defilement on the hand that holds it.            OENONE           Thus brooding on your bitter disappointment,           You only fan a fire that must be stifled.           Would it not be more worthy of the blood           Of Minos to find peace in nobler cares,           And, in defiance of a wretch who flies           From what he hates, reign, mount the proffer'd throne?            PHAEDRA           I reign! Shall I the rod of empire sway,           When reason reigns no longer o'er myself?           When I have lost control of all my senses?           When 'neath a shameful yoke I scarce can breathe?           When I am dying?            OENONE           Fly.            PHAEDRA           I cannot leave him.            OENONE           Dare you not fly from him you dared to banish?            PHAEDRA           The time for that is past. He knows my frenzy.           I have o'erstepp'd the bounds of modesty,           And blazon'd forth my shame before his eyes.           Hope stole into my heart against my will.           Did you not rally my declining pow'rs?           Was it not you yourself recall'd my soul           When fluttering on my lips, and with your counsel,           Lent me fresh life, and told me I might love him?            OENONE           Blame me or blame me not for your misfortunes,           Of what was I incapable, to save you?           But if your indignation e'er was roused           By insult, can you pardon his contempt?           How cruelly his eyes, severely fix'd,           Survey'd you almost prostrate at his feet!           How hateful then appear'd his savage pride!           Why did not Phaedra see him then as I           Beheld him?            PHAEDRA           This proud mood that you resent           May yield to time. The rudeness of the forests           Where he was bred, inured to rigorous laws,           Clings to him still; love is a word he ne'er           Had heard before. It may be his surprise           Stunn'd him, and too much vehemence was shown           In all I said.            OENONE           Remember that his mother           Was a barbarian.            PHAEDRA           Scythian tho' she was,           She learned to love.            OENONE           He has for all the sex           Hatred intense.            PHAEDRA           Then in his heart no rival           Shall ever reign. Your counsel comes too late           Oenone, serve my madness, not my reason.           His heart is inaccessible to love.           Let us attack him where he has more feeling.           The charms of sovereignty appear'd to touch him;           He could not hide that he was drawn to Athens;           His vessels' prows were thither turn'd already,           All sail was set to scud before the breeze.           Go you on my behalf, to his ambition           Appeal, and let the prospect of the crown           Dazzle his eyes. The sacred diadem           Shall deck his brow, no higher honour mine           Than there to bind it. His shall be the pow'r           I cannot keep; and he shall teach my son           How to rule men. It may be he will deign           To be to him a father. Son and mother           He shall control. Try ev'ry means to move him;           Your words will find more favour than can mine.           Urge him with groans and tears; show Phaedra dying.           Nor blush to use the voice of supplication.           In you is my last hope; I'll sanction all           You say; and on the issue hangs my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1977"],["title","Phaedra (#5)"],["body","e.              Scene II             PHAEDRA (alone)           Venus implacable, who seest me shamed           And sore confounded, have I not enough           Been humbled? How can cruelty be stretch'd           Farther? Thy shafts have all gone home, and thou           Hast triumph'd. Would'st thou win a new renown?           Attack an enemy more contumacious:           Hippolytus neglects thee, braves thy wrath,           Nor ever at thine altars bow'd the knee.           Thy name offends his proud, disdainful ears.           Our interests are alike: avenge thyself,           Force him to love--           But what is this? Oenone           Return'd already? He detests me then,           And will not hear you.              SCENE III           PHAEDRA, OENONE             OENONE           Madam, you must stifle           A fruitless love. Recall your former virtue:           The king who was thought dead will soon appear           Before your eyes, Theseus has just arrived,           Theseus is here. The people flock to see him           With eager haste. I went by your command           To find the prince, when with a thousand shouts           The air was rent--            PHAEDRA           My husband is alive,           That is enough, Oenone. I have own'd           A passion that dishonours him. He lives:           I ask to know no more.            OENONE           What?            PHAEDRA           I foretold it,           But you refused to hear. Your tears prevail'd           Over my just remorse. Dying this morn,           I had deserved compassion; your advice           I took, and die dishonour'd.            OENONE           Die?            PHAEDRA           Just Heav'ns!           What have I done to-day? My husband comes,           With him his son: and I shall see the witness           Of my adulterous flame watch with what face           I greet his father, while my heart is big           With sighs he scorn'd, and tears that could not move him           Moisten mine eyes. Think you that his respect           For Theseus will induce him to conceal           My madness, nor disgrace his sire and king?           Will he be able to keep back the horror           He has for me? His silence would be vain.           I know my treason, and I lack the boldness           Of those abandon'd women who can taste           Tranquillity in crime, and show a forehead           All unabash'd. I recognize my madness,           Recall it all. These vaulted roofs, methinks,           These walls can speak, and, ready to accuse me,           Wait but my husband's presence to reveal           My perfidy. Death only can remove           This weight of horror. Is it such misfortune           To cease to live? Death causes no alarm           To misery. I only fear the name           That I shall leave behind me. For my sons           How sad a heritage! The blood of Jove           Might justly swell the pride that boasts descent           From Heav'n, but heavy weighs a mother's guilt           Upon her offspring. Yes, I dread the scorn           That will be cast on them, with too much truth,           For my disgrace. I tremble when I think           That, crush'd beneath that curse, they'll never dare           To raise their eyes.            OENONE           Doubt not I pity both;           Never was fear more just than yours. Why, then,           Expose them to this ignominy? Why           Will you accuse yourself? You thus destroy           The only hope that's left; it will be said           That Phaedra, conscious of her perfidy,           Fled from her husband's sight. Hippolytus           Will be rejoiced that, dying, you should lend           His charge support. What can I answer him?           He'll find it easy to confute my tale,           And I shall hear him with an air of triumph           To every open ear repeat your shame.           Sooner than that may fire from heav'n consume me!           Deceive me not. Say, do you love him still?           How look you now on this contemptuous prince?            PHAEDRA           As on a monster frightful to mine eyes.            OENONE           Why yield him, then, an easy victory?           You fear him? Venture to accuse him first,           As guilty of the charge which he may bring           This day against you. Who can say 'tis false?           All tells against him: in your hands his sword           Happily left behind, your present trouble,           Your past distress, your warnings to his father,           His exile which your earnest pray'rs obtain'd.            PHAEDRA           What! Would you have me slander innocence?            OENONE           My zeal has need of naught from you but silence.           Like you I tremble, and am loath to do it;           More willingly I'd face a thousand deaths,           But since without this bitter remedy           I lose you, and to me your life outweighs           All else, I'll speak. Theseus, howe'er enraged           Will do no worse than banish him again.           A father, when he punishes, remains           A father, and his ire is satisfied           With a light sentence. But if guiltless blood           Should flow, is not your honour of more moment?           A treasure far too precious to be risk'd?           You must submit, whatever it dictates;           For, when our reputation is at stake,           All must be sacrificed, conscience itself.           But someone comes. 'Tis Theseus.            PHAEDRA           And I see           Hippolytus, my ruin plainly written           In his stern eyes. Do what you will; I trust           My fate to you. I cannot help myself.              SCENE IV           THESEUS, HIPPOLYTUS, PHAEDRA, OENONE, THERAMENES             THESEUS           Fortune no longer fights against my wishes,           Madam, and to your arms restores--            PHAEDRA           Stay, Theseus!           Do not profane endearments that were once           So sweet, but which I am unworthy now           To taste. You have been wrong'd. Fortune has proved           Spiteful, nor in your absence spared your wife.           I am unfit to meet your fond caress,           How I may bear my shame my only care           Henceforth.              Scene V           THESEUS, HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES             THESEUS           Strange welcome for your father, this!           What does it mean, my son?            HIPPOLYTUS           Phaedra alone           Can solve this mystery. But if my wish           Can move you, let me never see her more;           Suffer Hippolytus to disappear           For ever from the home that holds your wife.            THESEUS           You, my son! Leave me?            HIPPOLYTUS           'Twas not I who sought her:           'Twas you who led her footsteps to these shores.           At your departure you thought meet, my lord,           To trust Aricia and the Queen to this           Troezenian land, and I myself was charged           With their protection. But what cares henceforth           Need keep me here? My youth of idleness           Has shown its skill enough o'er paltry foes           That range the woods. May I not quit a life           Of such inglorious ease, and dip my spear           In nobler blood? Ere you had reach'd my age           More than one tyrant, monster more than one           Had felt the weight of your stout arm. Already,           Successful in attacking insolence,           You had removed all dangers that infested           Our coasts to east and west. The traveller fear'd           Outrage no longer. Hearing of your deeds,           Already Hercules relied on you,           And rested from his toils. While I, unknown           Son of so brave a sire, am far behind           Even my mother's footsteps. Let my courage           Have scope to act, and if some monster yet           Has 'scaped you, let me lay the glorious spoils           Down at your feet; or let the memory           Of death faced nobly keep my name alive,           And prove to all the world I was your son.            THESEUS           Why, what is this? What terror has possess'd           My family to make them fly before me?           If I return to find myself so fear'd,           So little welcome, why did Heav'n release me           From prison? My sole friend, misled by passion,           Was bent on robbing of his wife the tyrant           Who ruled Epirus. With regret I lent           The lover aid, but Fate had made us blind,           Myself as well as him. The tyrant seized me           Defenceless and unarm'd. Pirithous           I saw with tears cast forth to be devour'd           By savage beasts that lapp'd the blood of men.           Myself in gloomy caverns he inclosed,           Deep in the bowels of the earth, and nigh           To Pluto's realms. Six months I lay ere Heav'n           Had pity, and I 'scaped the watchful eyes           That guarded me. Then did I purge the world           Of a foul foe, and he himself has fed           His monsters. But when with expectant joy           To all that is most precious I draw near           Of what the gods have left me, when my soul           Looks for full satisfaction in a sight           So dear, my only welcome is a shudder,           Embrace rejected, and a hasty flight.           Inspiring, as I clearly do, such terror,           Would I were still a prisoner in Epirus!           Phaedra complains that I have suffer'd outrage.           Who has betray'd me? Speak. Why was I not           Avenged? Has Greece, to whom mine arm so oft           Brought useful aid, shelter'd the criminal?           You make no answer. Is my son, mine own           Dear son, confederate with mine enemies?           I'll enter. This suspense is overwhelming.           I'll learn at once the culprit and the crime,           And Phaedra must explain her troubled state.              Scene VI"]]]
