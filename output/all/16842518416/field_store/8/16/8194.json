He does not like Nurse to hold back his head and wash his face; and at last one day she let him go down-stairs with a dirty face, and then complained to Mother. So Mother asked Chris why he was so naughty about having his face washed, and he said, quite gravely, \"I do think it would be _such pity_ if the water got into my head again by accident.\" Mother did not know he had ever heard about it, but she said, \"Oh, Chris! Chris! that's one of your excuses.\" And he said, \"It's not my _'scusis_. She lets a good deal get in--at my ears--and lather too.\"  But, with all his whimsical ways, Lady Catherine is devoted to Christopher. She likes him far better than any one of us, and he is very fond of her; and they say quite rude things to each other all along. And Father says it is very lucky, for if she had not been so fond of Chris, and so ready to take him too, Mother would never have been persuaded to leave us when Aunt Catherine took them to the South of France.  Mother had been very unwell for a long time. She has so many worries, and Dr. Solomon said she ought to avoid worry, and Aunt Catherine said worries were killing her, and Father said \"Pshaw!\" and Aunt Catherine said \"Care killed the cat,\" and that a cat has nine lives, and a woman has only one; and then Mother got worse, and Aunt Catherine wanted to take her abroad, and she wouldn't go; and then Christopher was ill, and Aunt Catherine said she would take him too, if only Mother would go with her; and Dr. Solomon said it might be the turning-point of his health, and Father said \"the turning-point which way?\" but he thanked Lady Catherine, and they didn't quarrel; and so Mother yielded, and it was settled that they should go.  Before they went, Mother spoke to me, and told me I must be a Little Mother to the others whilst she was away. She hoped we should all try to please Father, and to be unselfish with each other; but she expected me to try far harder than the others, and never to think of myself at all, so that I might fill her place whilst she was away. So I promised to try, and I did.  We missed Christopher sadly. And Saxon missed him. The first time Saxon came to see us after Mother and Chris went away, we told him all about it, and he looked very sorry. Then we said that he should be our brother in Christopher's stead, whilst Chris was away; and he looked very much pleased, and wagged his tail, and licked our faces all round. So we told him to come and see us very often.  He did not, but we do not think it was his fault. He is chained up so much.  One day Arthur and I were walking down the road outside the Old Squire's stables, and Saxon smelt us, and we could hear him run and rattle his chain, and he gave deep, soft barks.  Arthur laughed. He said, \"Do you hear Saxon, Mary? Now I dare say the Old Squire thinks he smells tramps and wants to bite them. He doesn't know that Saxon smells his new sister and brother, and wishes he could go out walking with them in Mary's Meadow.\"     CHAPTER III.   Nothing comforted us so much whilst Mother and Chris were away as being allowed to play in the library.  We were not usually allowed to be there so often, but when we asked Father he gave us leave to amuse ourselves there at the time when Mother would have had us with her, provided that we did not bother him or hurt the books. We did not hurt the books, and in the end we were allowed to go there as much as we liked.  We have plenty of books of our own, and we have new ones very often: on birthdays and at Christmas. Sometimes they are interesting, and sometimes they are disappointing. Most of them have pretty pictures. It was because we had been rather unlucky for some time, and had had disappointing ones on our birthdays, that Arthur said to me, \"Look here, Mary, I'm not going to read any books now but grown-up ones, unless it is an Adventure Book. I'm sick of books for young people, there's so much _stuff_ in them.\"  We call it _stuff_ when there seems to be going to be a story and it comes to nothing but talk; and we call it _stuff_ when there is a very interesting picture, and you read to see what it is about, and the reading does not tell you, or tells you wrong.  Both Arthur and Christopher had had disappointments in their books on their birthdays.  Arthur jumped at his book at first, because there were Japanese pictures in it, and Uncle Charley had just been staying with us, and had brought beautiful Japanese pictures with him, and had told us Japanese fairy tales, and they were as good as Bechstein. So Arthur was full of Japan.  The most beautiful picture of all was of a stork, high up in a tall pine tree, and the branches of the pine tree, and the cones, and the pine needles were most beautifully drawn; and there was a nest with young storks in it, and behind the stork and the nest and the tall pine the sun was blazing with all his rays. And Uncle Charley told us the story to it, and it was called \"the Nest of the Stork.\"  So when Arthur saw a stork standing among pine needles in his new book he shouted with delight, though the pine needles were rather badly done, with thick strokes. But presently he said, \"It's not nearly so good a stork as Uncle Charley's. And where's the stem of the pine? It looks as if the stork were on the ground and on the top of the pine tree too, and there's no nest. And there's no sun. And, oh! Mary, what do you think is written under it? '_Crane and Water-reeds_.' Well, I do call that a sell!\"  Christopher's disappointment was quite as bad. Mother gave him a book with very nice pictures, particularly of beasts. The chief reason she got it for him was that there was such a very good picture of a toad, and Chris is so fond of toads. For months he made friends with one in the garden. It used to crawl away from him, and he used to creep after it, talking to it, and then it used to half begin, to crawl up the garden wall, and stand so, on its hind legs, and let Chris rub its wrinkled back. The toad in the picture was exactly like Christopher's toad, and he ran about the house with the book in his arms begging us to read him the story about Dear Toady.  We were all busy but Arthur, and he said, \"I want to go on with my water-wheel.\" But Mother said, \"Don't be selfish, Arthur.\" And he said, \"I forgot. All right, Chris; bring me the book.\" So they went and sat in the conservatory, not to disturb any one. But very soon they came back, Chris crying, and saying, \"It couldn't be the right one, Arthur;\" and Arthur frowning, and saying, \"It _is_ the right story; but it's _stuff_. I'll tell you what that book's good for, Chris. To paint the pictures. And you've got a new paint-box.\" So Mother said, \"What's the matter?\" And Arthur said, \"Chris thinks I haven't read him the right story to his Toad Picture. But I have, and what do you think it's about? It's about the silliest little girl you can imagine--a regular mawk of a girl--_and a Frog_. Not a toad, but a F. R. O. G. frog! A regular hop, skip, jumping frog!\"  Arthur hopped round the room, but Chris cried bitterly. So Arthur ran up to him and kissed him, and said, \"Don't cry, old chap, I'll tell you what I'll do. You get Mary to cut out a lot of the leaves of your book that have no pictures, and that will make it like a real scrap-book; and then I'll give you a lot of my scraps and pictures to paste over what's left of the stories, and you'll have such a painting-book as you never had in all your life before.\"  So we did. And Arthur was very good, for he gave Chris pictures that I know he prized, because Chris liked them. But the very first picture he gave him was the \"Crane and Water-reeds.\"  I thought it so good of Arthur to be so nice with Chris that I wished I could have helped him over his water-wheel. He had put Japan out of his head since the disappointment, and spent all his play-time in making mills and machinery. He did grind some corn into flour once, but it was not at all white. He said that was because the bran was left in. But it was not only bran in Arthur's flour. There was a good deal of sand too, from his millstones being made of sandstone, which he thought would not matter. But it grinds off.  Down in the valley, below Mary's Meadow, runs the Ladybrook, which turns the old water-wheel of Mary's Mill. It is a very picturesque old mill, and Mother has made beautiful sketches of it. She caught the last cold she got before going abroad with sketching it--the day we had a most delightful picnic there, and went about in the punt. And from that afternoon Arthur made up his mind that his next mill should be a water-mill.  The reason I am no good at helping Arthur about his mills is that I am stupid about machinery; and I was so vexed not to help him, that when I saw a book in the library which I thought would do so, I did not stop to take it out, for it was in four very large volumes, but ran off at once to tell Arthur.  He said, \"What _is_ the matter, Mary?\"  I said, \"Oh, Arthur! I've found a book that will tell you all about mills; and it is the nicest smelling book in the library.\"  \"The nicest _smelling_? What's that got to do with mills?\"  \"Nothing, of course. But it's bound in russia, and I am so fond of the smell of russia. But that's nothing. It's a Miller's Dictionary, and it is in four huge volumes, 'with plates.' I should think you could look out all about every kind of mill there ever was a miller to.\"  \"If the plates give sections and diagrams\"--Arthur began, but I did not hear the rest, for he started off for the library at once, and I ran after him.  But when we got Miller's Dictionary on the floor, how he did tease me! For there was nothing about mills or millers in it. It was a Gardener's and Botanist's Dictionary, by Philip Miller; and the plates were plates of flowers, very truly drawn, like the pine tree in Uncle Charley's Jap. picture. There were some sections too, but they were sections of greenhouses, not of any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19644"],["title","Mary's Meadow, and Other Tales of Fields and Flowers (#3)"],["body","of mills or machinery.  The odd thing was that it turned out a kind of help to Arthur after all. For we got so much interested in it that it roused us up about our gardens. We are all very fond of flowers, I most of all. And at last Arthur said he thought that miniature mills were really rather humbugging things, and it would be much easier and more useful to build a cold frame to keep choice auriculas and _half-hardies_ in.  When we took up our gardens so hotly, Harry and Adela took up theirs, and we did a great deal, for the weather was fine.  We were surprised to find that the Old Squire's Scotch Gardener knew Miller's Gardener's Dictionary quite well. He said, \"It's a gran' wurrk!\" (Arthur can say it just like him.)  One day he wished he could see it, and smell the russia binding; he said he liked to feel a nice smell. Father was away, and we were by ourselves, so we invited him into the library. Saxon wanted to come in too, but the gardener was very cross with him, and sent him out; and he sat on the mat outside and dribbled with longing to get in, and thudded his stiff tail whenever he saw any one through the doorway.  The Scotch Gardener enjoyed himself very much, and he explained a lot of things to Arthur, and helped us to put away the Dictionary when we had done with it.  When he took up his hat to go, he gave one long look all round the library. Then he turned to Arthur (and Saxon took advantage of this to wag his way in and join the party), and said, \"It's a rare privilege, the free entry of a book chamber like this. I'm hoping, young gentleman, that you're not insensible of it?\"  Then he caught sight of Saxon, and beat him out of the room with his hat.  But he came back himself to say, that it might just happen that he would be glad now and again to hear what was said about this or that plant (of which he would write down the botanical name) in these noble volumes.  So we told him that if he would bring Saxon to see us pretty often, we would look out anything he wanted to know about in Miller's Gardener's Dictionary.     CHAPTER IV.   Looking round the library one day, to see if I could see any more books about gardening, I found the Book of Paradise.  It is a very old book, and very queer. It has a brown leather back--not russia--and stiff little gold flowers and ornaments all the way down, where Miller's Dictionary has gold swans in crowns, and ornaments.  There are a good many old books in the library, but they are not generally very interesting--at least not to us. So when I found that though this one had a Latin name on the title-page, it was written in English, and that though it seemed to be about Paradise, it was really about a garden, and quite common flowers, I was delighted, for I always have cared more for gardening and flowers than for any other amusement, long before we found Miller's Gardener's Dictionary. And the Book of Paradise is much smaller than the Dictionary, and easier to hold. And I like old, queer things, and it is very old and queer.  The Latin name is _Paradisi in sole, Paradisus terrestris_, which we do not any of us understand, though we are all learning Latin; so we call it the Book of Paradise. But the English name is--\"Or a Garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English ayre will permitt to be noursed up;\" and on the top of every page is written \"The Garden of Pleasant Flowers,\" and it says--\"Collected by John Parkinson, Apothecary of London, and the King's Herbarist, 1629.\"  I had to think a minute to remember who was the king then, and it was King Charles I.; so then I knew that it was Queen Henrietta to whom the book was dedicated. This was the dedication:--  \"TO THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.       \"MADAME,--Knowing your Majesty so much delighted with all      the fair flowers of a Garden, and furnished with them as far      beyond others as you are eminent before them; this my Work      of a Garden long before this intended to be published, and      but now only finished, seemed as it were destined to be      first offered into your Highness's hands as of right,      challenging the propriety of Patronage from all others.      Accept, I beseech your Majesty, this speaking Garden, that      may inform you in all the particulars of your store as well      as wants, when you cannot see any of them fresh upon the      ground: and it shall further encourage him to accomplish the      remainder; who in praying that your Highness may enjoy the      heavenly Paradise, after many years' fruition of this      earthly, submitteth to be your Majesties,  \"In all humble devotion,  \"JOHN PARKINSON.\"  We like queer old things like this, they are so funny! I liked the Dedication, and I wondered if the Queen's Garden really was an Earthly Paradise, and whether she did enjoy reading John Parkinson's book about flowers in the winter time, when her own flowers were no longer \"fresh upon the ground.\" And then I wondered what flowers she had, and I looked out a great many of our chief favourites, and she had several kinds of them.  We are particularly fond of Daffodils, and she had several kinds of Daffodils, from the \"Primrose Peerlesse,\"[1] \"of a sweet but stuffing scent,\" to \"the least Daffodil of all,\"[2] which the book says \"was brought to us by a Frenchman called Francis le Vean, the honestest root-gatherer that ever came over to us.\"  [Footnote 1: _Narcissus media lutens vulgaris._]  [Footnote 2: _Narcissus minimus_, Parkinson. _N. minor_, Miller.]  The Queen had Cowslips too, though our gardener despised them when he saw them in my garden. I dug mine up in Mary's Meadow before Father and the Old Squire went to law; but they were only common Cowslips, with one Oxlip, by good luck. In the Earthly Paradise there were \"double Cowslips, one within another.\" And they were called Hose-in-Hose. I wished I had Hose-in-Hose.  Arthur was quite as much delighted with the Book of Paradise as I. He said, \"Isn't it funny to think of Queen Henrietta Maria gardening! I wonder if she went trailing up and down the walks looking like that picture of her we saw when you and I were in London with Mother about our teeth, and went to see the Loan Collection of Old Masters. I wonder if the Dwarf picked the flowers for her. I do wonder what Apothecary John Parkinson looked like when he offered his Speaking Garden into her Highness's hands. And what beautiful hands she had! Do you remember the picture, Mary? It was by Vandyck.\"  I remembered it quite well.  That afternoon the others could not amuse themselves, and wanted me to tell them a story. They do not like old stories too often, and it is rather difficult to invent new ones. Sometimes we do it by turns. We sit in a circle and one of us begins, and the next must add something, and so we go on. But that way does not make a good plot. My head was so full of the Book of Paradise that afternoon that I could not think of a story, but I said I would begin one. So I began:  \"Once upon a time there was a Queen--\"  \"How was she dressed?\" asked Adela, who thinks a good deal about dress.  \"She had a beautiful dark-blue satin robe.\"  \"_Princesse_ shape?\" inquired Adela.  \"No; Queen's shape,\" said Arthur. \"Drive on, Mary.\"  \"And lace ruffles falling back from her Highness's hands--\"  \"Sweet!\" murmured Adela.  \"And a high hat, with plumes, on her head, and--\"  \"A very low dwarf at her heels,\" added Arthur.  \"Was there really a dwarf, Mary?\" asked Harry.  \"There was,\" said I.  \"Had he a hump, or was he only a plain dwarf?\"  \"He was a very plain dwarf,\" said Arthur.  \"Does Arthur know the story, Mary?\"  \"No, Harry, he doesn't; and he oughtn't to interfere till I come to a stop.\"  \"Beg pardon, Mary. Drive on.\"  \"The Queen was very much delighted with all fair flowers, and she had a garden so full of them that it was called the Earthly Paradise.\"  There was a long-drawn and general \"Oh!\" of admiration.  \"But though she was a Queen, she couldn't have flowers in the winter, not even in an Earthly Paradise.\"  \"Don't you suppose she had a greenhouse, by the bye, Mary?\" said Arthur.  \"Oh, Arthur,\" cried Harry, \"I do wish you'd be quiet: when you know it's a fairy story, and that Queens of that sort never had greenhouses or anything like we have now.\"  \"And so the King's Apothecary and Herbarist, whose name was John Parkinson--\"  \"I shouldn't have thought he would have had a common name like that,\" said Harry.  \"Bessy's name is Parkinson,\" said Adela.  \"Well, I can't help it; his name _was_ John Parkinson.\"  \"Drive on, Mary!\" said Arthur.  \"And he made her a book, called the Book of Paradise, in which there were pictures and written accounts of her flowers, so that when she could not see any of them fresh upon the ground, she could read about them, and think about them, and count up how many she had.\"  \"Ah, but she couldn't tell. Some of them might have died in the winter,\" said Adela.  \"Ah, but some of the others might have got little ones at their roots,\" said Harry. \"So that would make up.\"  I said nothing. I was glad of the diversion, for I could not think how to go on with the story. Before I quite gave in, Harry luckily asked, \"Was there a Weeding Woman in the Earthly Paradise?\"  \"There was,\" said I.  \"How was she dressed?\" asked Adela.  \"She had a dress the colour of common earth.\"  \"_Princesse_ shape?\" inquired Arthur.  \"No; Weeding Woman shape. Arthur, I wish you wouldn't--\"  \"All right, Mary. Drive on.\"  \"And a little shawl, that had partly the colour of grass, and partly the colour of hay.\"  \"_Hay dear_!\" interpolated Arthur, exactly imitating a well-known sigh peculiar to Bessy's aunt.  \"Was her bonnet like our Weeding Woman's bonnet?\" asked Adela, in a disappointed tone.  \"Much larger,\" said I, \"and the colour of a Marigold.\"  Adela looked happier. \"Strings the same?\" she asked.  \"No. One string canary-colour, and the other white.\"  \"And a basket?\" asked Harry.  \"Yes, a basket, of course. Well, the Queen had all sorts of flowers in her "]]]
