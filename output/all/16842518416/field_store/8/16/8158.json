A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York. These boys varied in age from thirteen to seventeen. In another part of the field a few younger boys were amusing themselves. All these boys were boarding-scholars connected with the school.  The ball had been knocked to a distance by the batter, and it was the duty of Nicholas Thorne, one of the oldest boys, to ran after it. But he thought of an easier way.  \"Cameron, run for that ball!\" he cried, addressing one of the smaller boys outside the game.  \"I don't want to,\" said little Cameron.  \"Did you hear what I said?\" demanded Thorne, imperiously.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you'd better go if you know what's best for yourself,\" said the bully, frowning.  \"I ain't in the game,\" said Cameron. \"Why should I get the ball?\"  \"Because I say so!\" retorted the tyrant.  \"Run after it yourself, Thorne,\" said a lad named Davies. \"It's your business, not Cameron's.\"  \"It's his business, because I ordered him to do it,\" said Thorne, flushed and angry. \"Do you think I will allow him to bully me?\"  \"The boot's on the other leg,\" said Davies, dryly. \"Run after the ball, and don't keep the game waiting.\"  \"That's so,\" said half a dozen voices. \"Let Cameron alone.\"  \"I won't let him alone,\" said Thorne, who had by this time worked himself into a towering passion. \"I'll give him the worst flogging he ever had, if he doesn't obey me!\"  So saying, he advanced toward Cameron in a menacing manner.  Thorne was the acknowledged bully of the school. He was a big, hulking fellow, with a heavy figure and a repulsive face, and small ferret eyes, emitting a cold and baleful light. He was more than a match for any of his fellow-pupils, and availed himself of his superior physical strength to abuse and browbeat the smaller boys. Knowing his strength he was not afraid of interference, and usually carried his point. If Cameron had not been particularly occupied playing marbles with a boy of his own age he would not have ventured to object to obey the despot. When he saw Thorne advancing toward him with a cruel light in his eyes he became frightened, and said, hurriedly:  \"Don't pound me, Thorne, I'll go.\"  \"Yes,\" said Thorne, between his teeth, \"you'll go; but you ought to have done so at first. I'll give you something to remind you to be more prompt next time.\"  \"Don't hit me, Thorne!\" pleaded the little boy, with tears in his eyes. \"I'm going.\"  \"Shame, Thorne!\" exclaimed Davies.  Thorne glared at Davies wrathfully.  \"Take care how you talk,\" he said, \"or it'll be your turn next!\"  Davies was two inches shorter than Thorne, and by no means his equal. So, honestly indignant as he was, he didn't venture to say any more.  Little Cameron turned to run, despairing of help, and Thorne started to pursue him. Of course there was no chance of the smaller boy's escape, or would not have been, but for an unexpected incident.  \"Stop!\" was heard, in a clear, commanding voice.  Thorne turned in surprise. What boy (for it was a boy's voice) had dared to command him to atop?  He wasn't long in doubt.  Jasper Kent, a new scholar, who had only arrived the day before, advanced intrepidly to the rescue of the little victim. He was an inch shorter than Thorne, of a slight, elegant build, with a clear complexion and a bright, attractive face that would have been pronounced handsome by anyone. Judging from outward appearances, no one would have thought him the equal of Thorne in strength.  When Nicholas Thorne's eye lighted on his antagonist his lip turned in scorn and he paused.  \"You're the new boy, I believe?\" he said.  \"Yes.\"  \"I thought so. If you had been here longer you would know better than to interfere with me.\"  This was spoken with the utmost arrogance.  \"You appear to consider yourself master here,\" said Jasper, quietly.  \"I am master here,\" returned Nicholas, in the same tone.  \"And you claim the right of ordering around smaller boys?\"  \"I do.\"  \"And of beating them if they dare to disobey your majesty's commands, I suppose?\" continued Jasper, with sarcasm.  \"Yes, I do. Have you anything to say about it?\" exclaimed the young despot, in a swaggering manner.  \"Yes, I have,\" was the quiet answer.  \"What have you got to say, I should like to know?\"  \"That I won't allow it,\" said Jasper.  \"You won't allow it?\" exclaimed Thorne, bursting into a brutal laugh. \"And who are you, young poppinjay?\"  \"My name is Jasper Kent, at your service.\"  \"Then, Mr. Jasper Kent, I beg leave to suggest that you mind your own business.\"  \"I generally do,\" said Jasper, coolly; \"but that advice comes with a bad grace from you.\"  \"Why does it?\"  \"Because you are not attending to your business.\"  \"What is my business?\" demanded Thorne, angrily.  \"To go after that ball.\"  \"It's Cameron's business. I ordered him to go after it.\"  \"And I order him not to go for it,\" said Jasper, resolutely, but without excitement.  Thorne answered with an oath.  \"I've a great mind to send you for it,\" he exclaimed, his small eyes glaring at his opponent.  \"It's one thing to order, and another to secure obedience,\" said Jasper.  \"Your turn will come,\" growled Thorne, \"but just at present I've got Cameron's case to dispose of. Cameron, go for that ball!\"  The little boy started, but his purpose was interrupted. Jasper Kent hurried forward and placed his hand kindly on his shoulder.  \"Don't go, Cameron,\" he said. \"I'll protect you.\"  Cameron stopped, but looked apprehensively at Thorne. He evidently doubted the power of his young protector.  Thorne was now thoroughly exasperated. His authority was openly defied. He rushed at Jasper, intending to overwhelm him by the suddenness and momentum of his attack. But Jasper was prepared for him. He turned swiftly aside and planted a blow on Thorne's right ear which sent him staggering to the earth.  The bully was astonished, but rallied. Almost foaming at the mouth with rage, he sprang to his feet and renewed the attack. He attempted to throw his arms round the waist of Jasper and throw him. Had his tactics been successful, probably Jasper would have been borne to the earth by the superior weight of his opponent. But here, again, he was prepared. He stepped back and received Thorne with a blow on his breast, so firmly planted that he staggered again.  By this time he had lost all control of himself and was thoroughly under the dominion of passion. He \"pitched into\" Jasper, trying to get in a blow wherever he could, and in so doing exposed himself to the skilful blows of his slighter foe, who had some knowledge of boxing, while Thorne had none whatever.  Finally Thorne was stretched on his back, not immediately to rise.  \"Have you had enough?\" asked Jasper, bending over him.  \"I'll kill you!\" shrieked Thorne.  \"Wail till you are able,\" said Jasper.  Thorne struggled to rise. Jasper held him down forcibly.  \"You will stay there till you promise to let Cameron alone,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19592"],["title","Frank and Fearless; or, The Fortunes of Jasper Kent (#1)"],["body","\" he said.  \"I won't promise!\"  \"Then you'll stay where you are.\"  But at that moment a small boy came across the field from the school.  \"Thorne is wanted,\" he said. \"There's a lady to see him.\"  \"You can rise, then,\" said Jasper.  Thorne rose sullenly, and without a word strode toward the large, square building, with an extended wing, which was used for the boarding-school.  Little Cameron seized Jasper's hand and kissed it.  \"How brave you are!\" he said. \"How much I thank you!\"  \"Oh, it's nothing,\" said Jasper, modestly. \"You just send for me when you're in trouble, Cameron. I won't let him hurt you.\"     CHAPTER II.  STRANGE NEWS.   Entering the house, Thorne reported at the doctor's study. His flushed appearance attracted the teacher's attention.  \"What's the matter, Thorne?\" he asked.  \"The new boy pitched into me and I licked him,\" said Thorne.  But his sullen manner was so unlike that of a victor that the doctor shrewdly suspected that his statement was not wholly correct.  \"What was the quarrel about?\" he asked.  \"We were playing ball,\" said Thorne, evasively.  \"I will inquire into it. At present you are wanted in the parlor.\"  So Thorne left the presence of the principal and entered the opposite room. A lady, seated on a sofa, arose quickly, and advanced to meet him. She kissed the boy's cheek, to which he submitted without manifesting any responsive feeling.  \"How long it is since I saw you, Nicholas, my dear boy!\" she said.  \"It's only about six months,\" said Nicholas, stolidly.  \"And are not six months long for a mother to be separated from her only child?\" said the lady, tenderly.  \"It doesn't seem so long,\" said Nicholas.  The lady looked pained, but she proceeded:  \"How you have grown!\"  \"Yes, I've grown,\" said Nicholas, showing a little pleasure now. \"I think I shall be a large man.\"  \"Like your father. And how are you improving in your studies, Nicholas?\"  \"Oh! I'm doing well enough,\" said the boy, indifferently, for Nicholas Thorne's taste for study was very moderate. \"Did you bring me any money, mother?\"  \"You have your regular allowance, Nicholas.\"  \"It isn't enough. What's a dollar a week?\"  \"It is a good deal for me to pay,\" said his mother. \"Remember, I have to pay your school bills, and my means are but small.\"  \"A dollar a week is very small for a boy of my age,\" grumbled Thorne. \"Why, some of the little boys get more; and there's that new boy, Jasper Kent, gets five dollars, so they say.\"  The lady betrayed strong interest at the sound of his name.  \"I forgot,\" she said. \"So Jasper Kent has arrived, has he?\"  \"What, mother, do you know him?\" demanded Thorne, surprised in turn.  \"Yea, I know him. What do you think of him?\"  \"Think of him? I hate him!\" said Thorne, fiercely.  \"Why?\"  \"He tries to bully me.\"  \"And you permit it? Why, you are larger than he.\"  \"Yes, but he knows how to fight.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"I had a fight with him this morning,\" said Nicholas.  \"Did he come off best?\" asked the lady.  \"No,\" answered Nicholas, with hesitation. \"That is, we were only half through the fight when a boy ran up and said you had come. So we had to stop.\"  \"Humph! That is strange,\" said the lady, in a low voice, more to herself than to her son, \"this sudden antagonism.\"  \"What do you know about Kent?\" demanded Nicholas, his curiosity aroused.  \"Perhaps I may as well tell you,\" said his mother, thoughtfully, \"but I wish you to keep the matter secret from him.\"  \"You won't catch me telling him anything, except that he is a scoundrel!\" muttered Nicholas.  \"Then sit down by me, and I will tell you much that you do not know, but ought now to hear. Is the door shut?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Go and see. It is important that no one should overhear us.\"  Nicholas complied with her request.  \"It's shut fast enough,\" he said. \"Now what have you got to tell me?\"  \"To begin with, do you know where I get the money I pay for your schooling and clothes?\"  \"My father left you some money, didn't he?\"  \"He left me a small property which rents for two hundred dollars a year.\"  \"You pay three hundred a year for me, don't you?\"  \"For your school bills, yes. Besides, I give you an allowance and buy your clothes.\"  \"How do you do it?\" asked Nicholas, in surprise. \"Have you sold the house?\"  \"No. If I should do that, there would soon be nothing left. That was the problem I had to solve three years ago, when your father died.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"I felt that the property must not be touched, save the income. I saw that it was necessary for me to exert myself, or I should be unable to educate you as I desired. I had a good education, and I determined to avail myself of it. I therefore went to a teacher's agency in New York and set forth my desire to obtain the position of governess in some family in the country.\"  \"You a governess!\"  \"Why not? It was the only way I could think of that would yield me an income. After waiting a few weeks I succeeded. A wealthy gentleman, living in a country town of moderate size, saw my testimonials, was pleased with them, and engaged me to superintend the education of an orphan niece resident in his family. He offered me a fair salary--enough, added to the rent which I received from the property left me by your father, to justify me in putting you at this boarding-school. That was three years ago.\"  \"Why didn't you tell me all this before, mother?\"  \"It would have done no good. I preferred that you should think of me as possessing an independent property. I felt that it would enable you the better to hold up your head among your school-fellows, as they could know nothing of your antecedents.\"  \"Does Dr. Benton know this?\" asked Nicholas, quickly.  \"No; he only knows that I am a widow, He supposes that I have sufficient means.\"  \"I am glad of that.\"  \"Would it make any difference with him?\"  \"I don't know. Any way, I'd rather he wouldn't know it.\"  Nicholas Thorne sat by his mother's side thoughtful. He was disappointed to think that his mother's means were so limited, since it curtailed his future expectations. The thought of that mother working patiently to defray his expenses at school made comparatively little impression. He was essentially selfish, and, so long as his wants were provided for, he cared little who labored for him.  \"You don't ask the name of the man who employs me,\" said his mother.  Nicholas looked up.  \"I suppose it is nobody I ever heard of,\" he said.  \"No, you never heard of him, but you know some one connected with him.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the boy, his curiosity aroused.  \"The gentleman who employs me is father of one of your schoolmates.\"  \"Father of one of my school-mates?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Who is it? Why don't you tell me, mother?\"  \"You have spoken of him to me this morning. It is Jasper Kent.\"  \"You work for Jasper Kent's father!\" exclaimed Nicholas in unbounded astonishment. \"Does he know it?\"  \"Yes, he knows that I am, or have been, governess in his father's family. But he knows nothing of my connection with you.\"  \"If he knew, he'd taunt me with my mother's being obliged to work for a living,\" said Thorne.  \"I don't think he would. At any rate, the time is coming very soon when he will have no advantage over you.\"  \"How do you make that out, mother?\"  \"Listen, and keep secret what I tell you. Next week I become his father's wife.\"  \"You marry Jasper Kent's father!\"  \"Yes; I shall be Jasper's step-mother.\"  \"Is old Kent rich?\" asked Nicholas, eagerly.  His mother nodded.  \"Yes, he is rich; that is, for the country. He is in poor health, too,\" she added, significantly.  \"Good!\" said Nicholas, with satisfaction. \"You know how to play your cards, mother.\"  The mother smiled.  \"My days of dependence are drawing to an end,\" she said. \"Some time I can do better for you than I am doing now.\"     CHAPTER III.  JASPER RECOGNIZES THE VISITOR.   \"Will the old man do anything for me after he marries you, mother?\" asked Nicholas, who never failed to look out for his own interests.  \"He doesn't know you are in existence, Nicholas.\"  \"Did you never speak to him of me?\"  \"No; I didn't dare to tell him.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"It might prevent his marrying me.\"  \"It seems to me,\" grumbled Nicholas, \"you only thought of yourself. You didn't care what became of me.\"  \"That is unjust, Nicholas. You must see that it is. Once we are married I shall have more control of money, and if Mr. Kent dies I shall be entitled to a third of his property.\"  \"I wish he'd leave you the whole, and cut off that upstart Jasper,\" said Nicholas, frowning.  \"There is not much chance of that. He thinks everything of Jasper. However, I don't think he'll live long, and I shall induce him, if possible, to name me as Jasper's guardian.\"  \"That would be a good job for you, mother--not so good for Jasper, I'm thinking.\"  \"You are right, Nicholas. Did you say you disliked him?\"  \"Yes, I hate him.\"  \"So do I,\" said his mother in a low tone, but one of intense energy.  \"Why?\" asked Thorne, in some curiosity.  \"I'll tell you. From my entrance into his father's family he has never treated me with any cordiality. Evidently he didn't like me. I think, indeed, he mistrusted me, though I never gave occasion for any suspicions. If he should learn now that I am to marry his father, he would move heaven and earth to prevent the marriage.\"  \"Has he been home much since you were in the house?\"  \"No; he was at school elsewhere, and was only at home during his vacations.\"  \"How did he come to be sent here to this school? Did you advise it?\"  \"No; I was opposed to it, but Mr. Kent was recommended by a friend to send his son here. I did not venture to say much, lest I should be asked how I came to know anything of the school. I was afraid you and he would meet, and he would learn the connections between us.\"  \"I suppose you'll own up after the wedding, won't you?\"  \"I think not at once, Nicholas.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Remember what I told you, that Mr. Kent is in poor health. He may not live six months. We can keep the matter secret for that"]]]
