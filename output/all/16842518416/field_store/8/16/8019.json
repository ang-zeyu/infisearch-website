Andre-Louis found him ridiculous. He knew pretentiousness for the mask of worthlessness and weakness. And here he beheld pretentiousness incarnate. It was to be read in that arrogant poise of the head, that scowling brow, the inflexion of that reverberating voice. Even more difficult than it is for a man to be a hero to his valet--who has witnessed the dispersal of the parts that make up the imposing whole--is it for a man to be a hero to the student of Man who has witnessed the same in a different sense.  Andre-Louis stood forward boldly--impudently, thought M. de Lesdiguieres.  “You are His Majesty’s Lieutenant here in Brittany,” he said--and it almost seemed to the august lord of life and death that this fellow had the incredible effrontery to address him as one man speaking to another. “You are the dispenser of the King’s high justice in this province.”  Surprise spread on that handsome, sallow face under the heavily powdered wig.  “Is your business concerned with this infernal insubordination of the canaille?” he asked.  “It is not, monsieur.”  The black eyebrows rose. “Then what the devil do you mean by intruding upon me at a time when all my attention is being claimed by the obvious urgency of this disgraceful affair?”  “The affair that brings me is no less disgraceful and no less urgent.”  “It will have to wait!” thundered the great man in a passion, and tossing back a cloud of lace from his hand, he reached for the little silver bell upon his table.  “A moment, monsieur!” Andre-Louis’ tone was peremptory. M. de Lesdiguieres checked in sheer amazement at its impudence. “I can state it very briefly...”  “Haven’t I said already...”  “And when you have heard it,” Andre-Louis went on, relentlessly, interrupting the interruption, “you will agree with me as to its character.”  M. de Lesdiguieres considered him very sternly.  “What is your name?” he asked.  “Andre-Louis Moreau.”  “Well, Andre-Louis Moreau, if you can state your plea briefly, I will hear you. But I warn you that I shall be very angry if you fail to justify the impertinence of this insistence at so inopportune a moment.”  “You shall be the judge of that, monsieur,” said Andre-Louis, and he proceeded at once to state his case, beginning with the shooting of Mabey, and passing thence to the killing of M. de Vilmorin. But he withheld until the end the name of the great gentleman against whom he demanded justice, persuaded that did he introduce it earlier he would not be allowed to proceed.  He had a gift of oratory of whose full powers he was himself hardly conscious yet, though destined very soon to become so. He told his story well, without exaggeration, yet with a force of simple appeal that was irresistible. Gradually the great man’s face relaxed from its forbidding severity. Interest, warming almost to sympathy, came to be reflected on it.  “And who, sir, is the man you charge with this?”  “The Marquis de La Tour d’Azyr.”  The effect of that formidable name was immediate. Dismayed anger, and an arrogance more utter than before, took the place of the sympathy he had been betrayed into displaying.  “Who?” he shouted, and without waiting for an answer, “Why, here’s impudence,” he stormed on, “to come before me with such a charge against a gentleman of M. de La Tour d’Azyr’s eminence! How dare you speak of him as a coward....”  “I speak of him as a murderer,” the young man corrected. “And I demand justice against him.”  “You demand it, do you? My God, what next?”  “That is for you to say, monsieur.”  It surprised the great gentleman into a more or less successful effort of self-control.  “Let me warn you,” said he, acidly, “that it is not wise to make wild accusations against a nobleman. That, in itself, is a punishable offence, as you may learn. Now listen to me. In this matter of Mabey--assuming your statement of it to be exact--the gamekeeper may have exceeded his duty; but by so little that it is hardly worth comment. Consider, however, that in any case it is not a matter for the King’s Lieutenant, or for any court but the seigneurial court of M. de La Tour d’Azyr himself. It is before the magistrates of his own appointing that such a matter must be laid, since it is matter strictly concerning his own seigneurial jurisdiction. As a lawyer you should not need to be told so much.”  “As a lawyer, I am prepared to argue the point. But, as a lawyer I also realize that if that case were prosecuted, it could only end in the unjust punishment of a wretched gamekeeper, who did no more than carry out his orders, but who none the less would now be made a scapegoat, if scapegoat were necessary. I am not concerned to hang Benet on the gallows earned by M. de La Tour d’Azyr.”  M. de Lesdiguieres smote the table violently. “My God!” he cried out, to add more quietly, on a note of menace, “You are singularly insolent, my man.”  “That is not my intention, sir, I assure you. I am a lawyer, pleading a case--the case of M. de Vilmorin. It is for his assassination that I have come to beg the King’s justice.”  “But you yourself have said that it was a duel!” cried the Lieutenant, between anger and bewilderment.  “I have said that it was made to appear a duel. There is a distinction, as I shall show, if you will condescend to hear me out.”  “Take your own time, sir!” said the ironical M. de Lesdiguieres, whose tenure of office had never yet held anything that remotely resembled this experience.  Andre-Louis took him literally. “I thank you, sir,” he answered, solemnly, and submitted his argument. “It can be shown that M. de Vilmorin never practised fencing in all his life, and it is notorious that M. de La Tour d’Azyr is an exceptional swordsman. Is it a duel, monsieur, where one of the combatants alone is armed? For it amounts to that on a comparison of their measures of respective skill.”  “There has scarcely been a duel fought on which the same trumpery argument might not be advanced.”  “But not always with equal justice. And in one case, at least, it was advanced successfully.”  “Successfully? When was that?”  “Ten years ago, in Dauphiny. I refer to the case of M. de Gesvres, a gentleman of that province, who forced a duel upon M. de la Roche Jeannine, and killed him. M. de Jeannine was a member of a powerful family, which exerted itself to obtain justice. It put forward just such arguments as now obtain against M. de La Tour d’Azyr. As you will remember, the judges held that the provocation had proceeded of intent from M. de Gesvres; they found him guilty of premeditated murder, and he was hanged.”  M. de Lesdiguieres exploded yet again. “Death of my life!” he cried. “Have you the effrontery to suggest that M. de La Tour d’Azyr should be hanged? Have you?”  “But why not, monsieur, if it is the law, and there is precedent for it, as I have shown you, and if it can be established that what I state is the truth--as established it can be without difficulty?”  “Do you ask me, why not? Have you temerity to ask me that?”  “I have, monsieur. Can you answer me? If you cannot, monsieur, I shall understand that whilst it is possible for a powerful family like that of La Roche Jeannine to set the law in motion, the law must remain inert for the obscure and uninfluential, however brutally wronged by a great nobleman.”  M. de Lesdiguieres perceived that in argument he would accomplish nothing against this impassive, resolute young man. The menace of him grew more fierce.  “I should advise you to take yourself off at once, and to be thankful for the opportunity to depart unscathed.”  “I am, then, to understand, monsieur, that there will be no inquiry into this case? That nothing that I can say will move you?”  “You are to understand that if you are still there in two minutes it will be very much the worse for you.” And M. de Lesdiguieres tinkled the silver hand-bell upon his table.  “I have informed you, monsieur, that a duel--so-called--has been fought, and a man killed. It seems that I must remind you, the administrator of the King’s justice, that duels are against the law, and that it is your duty to hold an inquiry. I come as the legal representative of the bereaved mother of M. de Vilmorin to demand of you the inquiry that is due.”  The door behind Andre-Louis opened softly. M. de Lesdiguieres, pale with anger, contained himself with difficulty.  “You seek to compel us, do you, you impudent rascal?” he growled. “You think the King’s justice is to be driven headlong by the voice of any impudent roturier? I marvel at my own patience with you. But I give you a last warning, master lawyer; keep a closer guard over that insolent tongue of yours, or you will have cause very bitterly to regret its glibness.” He waved a jewelled, contemptuous hand, and spoke to the usher standing behind Andre. “To the door!” he said, shortly.  Andre-Louis hesitated a second. Then with a shrug he turned. This was the windmill, indeed, and he a poor knight of rueful countenance. To attack it at closer quarters would mean being dashed to pieces. Yet on the threshold he turned again.  “M. de Lesdiguieres,” said he, “may I recite to you an interesting fact in natural history? The tiger is a great lord in the jungle, and was for centuries the terror of lesser beasts, including the wolf. The wolf, himself a hunter, wearied of being hunted. He took to associating with other wolves, and then the wolves, driven to form packs for self-protection, discovered the power of the pack, and took to hunting the tiger, with disastrous results to him. You should study Buffon, M. de Lesdiguieres.”  “I have studied a buffoon this morning, I think,” was the punning sneer with which M. de Lesdiguieres replied. But that he conceived himself witty, it is probable he would not have condescended to reply at all. “I don’t understand you,” he added.  “But you will, M. de Lesdiguieres. You will,” said Andre-Louis, and so departed.      CHAPTER VII."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19470"],["title","Yorkshire Lyrics (#0)"],["body","Lyrics.

Mi darlin' Muse, aw coax and pet her, To pleeas yo, for aw like nowt better; An' if aw find aw connot get her          To lend her aid, Into foorced measure then aw set her,          The stupid jade!  An' if mi lines dooant run as spreetly, Nor beam wi gems o' wit soa breetly, Place all the blame,--yo'll place it reightly,          Upon her back; To win her smile aw follow neetly,          Along her track.  Maybe shoo thinks to stop mi folly, An let me taste o' melancholy; But just to spite her awl be jolly,          An say mi say; Awl fire away another volley          Tho' shoo says \"Nay.\"  We've had some happy times together, For monny years we've stretched our tether, An as aw dunnot care a feather          For fowk 'at grummel, We'll have another try. Aye! whether          We stand or tummel.  Sometimes th' reward for all us trubble, Has been a crop o' scrunty stubble, But th' harvest someday may be double,          At least we'll trust it; An them 'at say it's but a bubble,          We'll leeav to brust it.    To a Daisy, Found blooming March 7th.   A'a awm feeared tha's come too sooin,          Little daisy! Pray, whativer wor ta doin?          Are ta crazy? Winter winds are blowin' yet,-- Tha'll be starved, mi little pet.  Did a gleam o' sunshine warm thee,          An' deceive thee? Niver let appearance charm thee,          For believe me, Smiles tha'll find are oft but snares, Laid to catch thee unawares.  Still aw think it luks a shame,          To tawk sich stuff; Aw've lost faith, an' tha'll do th' same,          Hi, sooin enuff. If tha'rt happy as tha art Trustin' must be th' wisest part.  Come, aw'll pile some bits o' stooan,          Raand thi dwellin'; They may screen thee when aw've gooanm,          Ther's no tellin'; An' when gentle spring draws near Aw'll release thee, niver fear.  An' if then thi pretty face,          Greets me smilin'; Aw may come an' sit bith' place,          Time beguilin'; Glad to think aw'd paar to be, Of some use, if but to thee.    Mi Bonny Yorksher Lass.   Aw've travelled East, West, North, an South,    An led a rooamin' life; Aw've met wi things ov stirlin' worth,    Aw've shared wi joy an strife; Aw've kept a gooid stiff upper lip,    Whativver's come to pass: But th' captain of mi Fortun's ship,    Has been mi Yorksher Lass.  Storm-tossed, sails rent, an reckonin' lost,    A toy for wind an wave; Mid blindin' fog an snow an frost,    Aw've thowt noa power could save; But ivver in the darkest day,    Wi muscles strong as brass, To some safe port shoo's led the way,--    Mi honest Yorksher Lass.  Shoo's fair,--all Yorksher lasses are,--    Shoo's bonny as the rest, Her brow ne'er shows a line o' care,    Shoo thinks what is, is best. Shoo's lovin', true, an full o' pluck,    An it seems as clear as glass, 'At th' lad is sewer to meet gooid luck    'At weds a Yorksher Lass.  Ther's oriental beauties, an'    Grand fowk ov ivvery grade, But when it comes to honest worth,     Shoo puts 'em all ith' shade, For wi her charms an virtues,    Shoo stands at top o'th' class; Ther's nooan soa rare as can compare,    Wi a bonny Yorksher Lass,  Then here's to th' Yorksher lasses!    Whearivver they may be; Ther worth ther's nooan surpasses,     An ther's nooan as brave an free! If awd to live life o'er ageean,     Awd think misen an ass, If aw didn't tak for company,     A bonny Yorksher lass.    Give it 'em Hot.   Give it 'em hot, an be hanged to ther feelins!    Souls may be lost wol yor choosin' yor words! Out wi' them doctrines 'at taich o' fair dealins!    Daan wi' a vice tho' it may be a lord's! What does it matter if truth be unpleasant?    Are we to lie a man's pride to exalt! Why should a prince be excused, when a peasant    Is bullied an' blamed for a mich smaller fault?  O, ther's too mich o' that sneakin and bendin;    An honest man still should be fearless and bold; But at this day fowk seem to be feeared ov offendin,    An' they'll bow to a cauf if it's nobbut o' gold. Give me a crust tho' it's dry, an' a hard 'en,    If aw know it's my own aw can ait it wi' glee; Aw'd rayther bith hauf work all th' day for a farden,    Nor haddle a fortun wi' bendin' mi knee.  Let ivery man by his merit be tested,    Net by his pocket or th' clooas on his back; Let hypocrites all o' ther clooaks be divested,    An' what they're entitled to, that let em tak. Give it 'em hot! but remember when praichin,    All yo 'at profess others failins to tell, 'At yo'll do far moor gooid wi' yor tawkin an' taichin,    If yo set an example, an' improve yorsel.
