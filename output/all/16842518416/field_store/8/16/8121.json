HOW TO CLEAN A RIFLE AND BAYONET   Get a rag and rub the heavy grease off; then get a soft pine stick, pointed at one end, and with this point remove the grease from the cracks, crevices and corners. Clean the bore from the breech. When the heavy grease has been removed, the metal part of the gun, bore included, should be covered with a light coating of \"3-in-1\" oil. Heavy grease can be removed from the rifle by rubbing it with a rag which has been saturated with gasoline or coal oil.    FRIENDS   There are a few men in all companies who play, loaf, and who are constantly in trouble. As the good men in each company will not become friendly with them, they seek their acquaintances among the new men on whom they have a baneful influence. We wish to warn you about making friends too quickly.    FINAL SUGGESTIONS   Don't be profane or tell questionable stories to your bunkies or around the company. There is a much greater number of silent and unprotesting men in camp than is generally supposed, to whom this is offensive. Keep everything on a high plane.     CHAPTER II[1]  Read this chapter as soon as you decide to attend a Camp.    PHYSICAL EXERCISE   The greatest problem you will have to solve will be that of making your body do the work required. Every one else will be doing exactly what you are doing, and you have too much pride to want to take even a shorter step than the man by your side. Some men have to leave the training camps because they are not in the proper physical condition to go on with the work. If this chapter is taken as seriously as it should be, it will be of great help to you.  If you have not a pair of sensible marching shoes (tan, high-tops, no hooks on them) get a pair. These shoes should be considerably larger than a pair of office shoes.  Walk to and from your business. Take every opportunity to get out in the country where the air is pure. Fill your lungs full. Get into the habit of taking deep breaths now and then. Don't make this a task, but surround it with pleasantries. Get some delightful companion to walk with you. Walk vigorously.  Let down on your smoking. Better to leave it alone for a while. You will enjoy the air. Deep breathing seems to be more natural.  Make it a work for your country. View it in that light. If you are not going to be called upon to undergo the cruel hardships and physical strain of some campaigns, your son will be, and you can be of great help to him by being fit yourself. You and your sons will form the backbone of America's strength in her next peril.  You will have a great deal of walking after you arrive in camp, possibly a great deal more than you have ever had, and probably a great deal more than you expect, even with this word of warning. If you have failed to provide yourself with proper shoes and socks, great will be the price of your lack of forethought. You will wince at your own blisters. You will get no sympathy from any one else. It is the spirit of the camp for each man to bear his own burdens. So arrive at camp with hardened legs and broken in shoes. Don't buy shoes with pointed or narrow toes. They should be broad and airy.  Immediately after you arise in the morning and just before you retire at night, go through the following exercises for two or three minutes. In a short time you may want to make it more. No objection. Give it a fair trial. Be brisk and energetic. Forget, for the time being, what you are going to get out of it. Give and then give more. The result will take care of itself.   1st Exercise  Involving practically every important muscle in the body.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  From first position spring to second position; instantly return to first position and continue.  Be light on your feet. Alight on your toes. Begin with a limited number of times. Day by day increase it a little until you reach a fair number. Be most moderate at first. Never allow yourself in any exercise to become greatly fatigued.   2d Exercise  To reduce waist, strengthen back muscles, and become limber.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  Assume position No. 1.  Swing to position (No. 2), return at once to No. 1, and continue.  Shoot your head and arms as far through your legs as your conformation permits.   3rd Exercise  To harden leg muscles and exercise joints.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  From position No. 1 come to position No. 2. Return at once to No. 1 and continue.  Toes turned well out. Body and head erect. Up with a slight spring. After a little practice, you will have no difficulty with this exercise in balancing yourself.   4th Exercise  To exercise arms and shoulders and organs of chest and shoulder muscles.  [Illustration: No. 1]  From position No. 1 thrust arms forward to position No. 2, and return at once to position No. 1.  [Illustration: No. 2]  Vary by thrusting arms downward, sideward and upward. Be moderate at first. Grow more vigorous with practice.   5th Exercise  [Illustration: No. 1]  To strengthen ankles and insteps.  From position No. 1 rise on the toes to position No. 2, return at once to position No. 1, and continue.  Go up on your toes as high as you can.  [Illustration: No. 2]     CHAPTER III  SCHOOL OF THE SOLDIER  Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations    Success in battle is the ultimate object of all military training; hence the excellence of an organization is judged by its field efficiency. Your instruction will be progressive in character, and will have as its ultimate purpose the creation of a company measuring up to a high standard of field efficiency.  The Preparatory Command, such as Forward, indicates the movement that is to be executed.  The Command of Execution, such as MARCH, HALT, or ARMS, commences the execution of the movement.  Preparatory Commands are distinguished by bold face, those of execution by capitals. As, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.  The average man understands better and learns faster when you show him how a thing is done. Don't be content with telling him how. Bear this in mind when you become an instructor.  On account of the absence of the Regular Army on the border, it was not practical to obtain photographs of regular troops with which to illustrate this book. The photographs used were taken under the direct supervision of the authors.    POSITION OF A SOLDIER AT ATTENTION   [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Eyes to the front. Hands hang naturally. Rest weight of the body equally on feet. Feet turned out making angles of 45°.  No. 2. Head erect. Shoulders down and back. Chest out. Stomach up. Thumb along the seams of trousers. Knees straight, not stiff. Heels on line and together. Do not stiffen the fingers: The mind ought also to be at attention.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 INCORRECT POSITIONS]  No. 1. Don't gaze about. That's not playing the game. Don't turn your feet out making an angle of 100°.  No. 2. Don't slouch. Hold yourself up. Keep your eyes off the ground.  These are the common errors of beginners.   1. Parade, 2. REST.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Clasp hands without constraint in front of center of body. Left hand uppermost. Fingers joined. Thumb and fore finger right hand clasps the left thumb.  No. 2. Bend left knee slightly. Right foot is carried 6 inches straight to the rear.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 INCORRECT POSITIONS]  No. 1. Not looking straight to the front. Right foot not carried straight to the rear.  No. 2. Leaning back too far. Right foot carried back too far.   1. Hand, 2. SALUTE.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Look toward the person saluted.  No. 2. Tip of forefinger right hand touches cap or hat above right eye. Thumb and forefingers extended and joined. Hand and wrist straight. Palm to the left.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 INCORRECT POSITIONS OR COMMON ERRORS]  No. 1. Palm of the hand to the front and fingers not joined.  No. 2. Arm held too high. Fingers not perfectly joined.  No. 3. Fingers not extended and joined. Left hand not by side while salute is being made.  Some beginners forget, while saluting, to remove their pipes, cigarettes, or cigars from their mouths. This proves clearly that they are beginners, for trained and experienced men are careful about military honors and salutes.    THE RESTS   Being at a halt, the commands are: FALL OUT; REST; AT EASE; and 1. Parade, 2. REST.  At the command fall out, the men may leave the ranks, but are required to remain in the immediate vicinity. They resume their former places, at attention, at the command fall in.  At the command rest, each man keeps one foot in place, but is not required to preserve silence or immobility.  At the command at ease, each man keeps one foot in place and is required to preserve silence, but not immobility.   1. Parade, 2. REST. Previously explained.  To resume the attention: 1. Squad, 2. ATTENTION. The men take the position of the soldier.    EYES RIGHT OR LEFT   1. Eyes, 2. RIGHT (LEFT), 3. FRONT.  [Illustration]  At the command right, turn the head to the right oblique, eyes fixed on the line of eyes of the men in, or supposed to be in, the same rank. At the command front, turn the head and eyes to the front. Notice the right file does not turn the eyes to the right.    FACINGS   To the flank: 1. Right (left), 2. FACE.  [Illustration]  Raise slightly the left heel and right toe; face to the right, turning on the right heel, assisted by a slight pressure on the ball of the left foot; place the left foot by the side of the right. Left face is executed on the left heel in the corresponding manner.  Right (left) Half Face is executed similarly, facing 45°.  To the rear: 1. About, 2. FACE.  Carry the toe of the right foot about a half foot-length to the rear and slightly to the left of the left heel without changing the position of the left foot; face to the rear, turning to the right on the left heel and right"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],["title","The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#3)"],["body","e; place the right heel by the side of the left. There is no left about face.    STEPS AND MARCHINGS   All steps and marchings executed from a halt, except right step, begin with the left foot.  The length of the full step in quick time is 30 inches, measured from heel to heel, and the cadence is at the rate of 120 steps per minute.  The length of the full step in double time is 36 inches; the cadence is at the rate of 180 steps per minute.  The instructor, when necessary, indicates the cadence of the step by calling one, two, three, four, or left, right, the instant the left and right foot, respectively, should be planted.  All steps and marchings and movements involving march are executed in quick time unless the squad be marching in double time, or double time be added to the command; in the latter case double time is added to the preparatory command. Example: 1. Squad right, double time, 2. MARCH (School of the Squad).    QUICK TIME   Being at a halt, to march forward in quick time: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.  At the command forward, shift the weight of the body to the right leg, left knee straight.  At the command march, move the left foot smartly straight forward 30 inches from the right, sole near the ground, and plant it without shock; next, in like manner, advance the right foot and plant it as above; continue the march. The arms swing naturally.  Being at a halt, or in march in quick time, to march in double time: 1. Double time, 2. MARCH.  If at a halt, at the first command shift the weight of the body to the right leg. At the command march, raise the forearms, fingers closed, to a horizontal position along the waist line; take up an easy run with the step and cadence of double time, allowing a natural swinging motion to the arms.  If marching in quick time, at the command march, given as either foot strikes the ground, take one step in quick time, and then step off in double time.  To resume the quick time: 1. Quick time, 2. MARCH.  At the command march, given as either foot strikes the ground, advance and plant the other foot in double time; resume the quick time, dropping the hands by the sides.    TO MARK TIME   Being in march: 1. Mark time, 2. MARCH. At the command march, given as either foot strikes the ground, advance and plant the other foot; bring up the foot in rear and continue the cadence by alternately raising each foot about 2 inches and planting it on line with the other.  Being at a halt, at the command march, raise and plant the feet as prescribed above. Common errors are to raise the feet several inches and to run up the cadence, i.e., go too fast.  1. Half step, 2. MARCH.  Take steps of 15 inches in quick time, 18 inches in double time.  Forward, half step, halt, and mark time may be executed one from the other in quick or double time. Any step less than the full step (i.e., half step, right step, or backward) is apt to be too fast, i.e., greater than 120 steps a minute.  To resume the full step from half step or mark time: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.    SIDE STEP   Being at a halt or mark time: 1. Right (left) step, 2. MARCH.  Carry and plant the right foot 15 inches to the right; bring the left foot beside it and continue the movement in the cadence of quick time.  The side step is used for short distances only and is not executed in double time.  If at order arms, the side step is executed at trail without command.    BACK STEP   Being at a halt or mark time: 1. Backward, 2. MARCH.  Take steps of 15 inches straight to the rear.  The back step is used for short distances only and is not executed in double time.  If at order arms, the back step is executed at trail without command.    TO HALT   To arrest the march in quick or double time: 1. Squad, 2. HALT.  At the command halt, given as either foot strikes the ground, plant the other foot as in marching; raise and place the first foot by the side of the other. If in double time, drop the hands by the sides.    TO MARCH BY THE FLANK   Being in march: 1. By the right (left) flank, 2. MARCH.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  The command march must be given when the right foot is on the ground as shown in No. 1. Then advance and plant the left foot and turn on the toes to right as shown in No. 2, and step off with the right foot.    TO MARCH TO THE REAR   Being in march: 1. To the rear, 2. MARCH.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  At the command march, given as the right foot strikes the ground, advance and plant the left foot; turn to the right about on the balls of both feet and immediately step off with the left foot.  The turn is made on the toes as shown.  The command march must be given when the right foot is on the ground. The left foot is then advanced to the position shown.  If marching in double time, turn to the right about, taking four steps in place, keeping the cadence, and then step off with the left foot.    CHANGE STEP   Being in march; 1. Change step, 2. MARCH.  At the command march, given as the right foot strikes the ground, advance and plant the left foot; plant the toe of the right foot near the heel of the left and step off with the left foot.  The change on the right foot is similarly executed, the command march being given as the left foot strikes the ground.    MANUAL OF ARMS   To acquire proficiency in the Manual of Arms, you should practice, practice, and practice.  Position of order arms standing, i.e., the position of attention under arms.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Arm and hands hang naturally. Right hand holding piece between thumb and fingers. Butt rests evenly on ground. Barrel to the rear.  No. 2. Toe of the butt on a line with toe of and touching the right shoe.  To execute the movements in detail, the instructor first cautions: \"By the Numbers\"; all movements divided into motions, are then executed singly. That is to say, make one motion and then wait until a further command for another. This is for the purpose of correcting erroneous positions and giving detailed instructions. We are explaining the manual by the numbers.  [Illustration: FIRST POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS FROM ORDER ARMS]  Being at order arms: 1. Present, 2. ARMS. It takes two counts.  At command arms, with the right hand carry the piece in front of the center of the body. Barrel to the rear and vertical. Grasp it with left hand at the balance. Left forearm is horizontal and rests against body. The balance of the piece is approximately the position of the rear sight.  [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS]  At command two, grasp the small of the stock with the right hand.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3  INCORRECT POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS  These are the common errors made by beginners.]  No. 1. Thumb along barrel.  No. 2. Piece held too low. The front sight will be a little above the eyes when the left fore arm is horizontal.  No. 3. Piece not vertical; too close to body.    Being at order arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It takes one count.  [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF PORT ARMS]  At the command ARMS, with the right hand raise and throw the piece diagonally across the body, grasp it smartly with both hands; the right; palm down, at the small of stock; the left, palm up, at the balance; barrel up, sloping to the left and crossing opposite the junction of the neck with the left shoulder; right forearm horizontal; left forearm resting against the body. The rifle is held in a vertical plane parallel to the front.  In executing this movement, it is a common error with beginners to raise the piece as though it weighed much more than it does. No part of the body should move except the arms, in coming to \"port arms\" from \"order arms.\"  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 INCORRECT POSITIONS OF PORT ARMS]  No. 1. Arms held away from side.  No. 2. Piece held too low and too close to body.  No. 3. Piece held too high and not in a vertical plane parallel to the body.  Being at present arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It is executed in one count. At the command arms, carry the piece diagonally across the body and take the position of \"port arms.\"  Being at port arms: 1. Present, 2. ARMS. It is executed in one count. At the command arms, carry the piece to a vertical position in front of the center of the body and take the position of present arms.  Being at present or port arms: 1. Order, 2. ARMS. It is executed in two counts.  [Illustration: NEXT TO THE LAST POSITION OF ORDER ARMS]  At the command arms, let go with the right hand; lower and carry the piece to the right with the left hand; regrasp it with the right hand just above the lower band; let go with the left hand and take the position shown here, which is the next to the last position in coming to the order. The left hand should be above and near the right, steadying the gun, fingers extended and joined, forearm and wrist straight and inclined downward. Barrel to the rear. All the fingers of the right hand grasp the gun. Butt about 3 inches from the ground.  Being in the above position, at the command Two, lower the piece gently to the ground with the right hand, drop the left hand quickly by the side, and take the position of order arms.  The common errors are to slam the gun down on the ground and to drop the left hand by the side in a slow and indifferent manner.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 INCORRECT POSITIONS]  Common errors in the next to the last positions of order arms.  No. 1. Thumb is up. Gun too far from the ground.  No. 2. Gun too near to ground. Thumb is up. Butt of gun too far to the right.  No. 3. Gun held too high and too far away from body.  Being at order arms: 1. Right shoulder, 2. ARMS. It is executed in three counts.  At the command arms, with the right hand raise and throw the piece diagonally across the body; carry the right hand quickly to the butt, and at the same time grasp the heel between the first two fingers as shown. Note the position of the first two fingers of right hand.  [Illustration: THE FIRST POSITION OF RIGHT SHOULDER ARMS FROM THE"]]]
