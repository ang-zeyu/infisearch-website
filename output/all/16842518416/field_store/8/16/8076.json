No one seems to know much about his father, except that he was nearly always away from home, and he died suddenly in California a little more than a year ago.  I haven't been able to find out that he left any property, so Merriwell is dependent on the generosity of a rather crabbed and crusty old uncle, whose head is filled with freaks and fancies.  He seems to be just the kind of a man who would be easily turned against a nephew who had, as he would consider it, gone astray.\"  \"That settles Merriwell!  If we cannot get the old uncle down on him, we are pretty poor schemers.\"  They looked at each other and smiled again.  A precious pair of youthful plotters they were!  \"We must be slick about this business,\" warned Snell.  \"We mustn't let anybody but ourselves get the least wind of it.\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"And we must do our prettiest to pull the wool over Merriwell's eyes, for you know he is rather discerning in some things, and he may be inclined to be wary.  We must seem to think he is the finest fellow in the world.\"  \"That will be pretty hard,\" said Leslie, with a wry face, \"but I have been doing something in that line of late, and I will keep it up.  That business doesn't come so easy for me as it does for you.\"  \"You can do it, if you try.  And I shall depend on you to skin him with the papers.\"  \"That won't be hard, if he plays square.\"  \"I don't think there is any doubt about that.  He is one of the kind of fellows who doesn't know enough to play any other way.\"  \"Then Frank Merriwell's name is mud--with a capital M.\"     CHAPTER VII.  SPREADING THE SNARE.  The plot was laid, the snare was set, but the game seemed wary.  For some time Frank Merriwell remained away from those midnight gatherings in the room of the student who had committed suicide.  \"Hang the luck!\" exclaimed Gage.  \"Is he going to keep away right along?\"  \"He must not be allowed to do so,\" said Leslie.  \"He must be shamed into coming.\"  \"That may not be easy.\"  \"It should not be difficult with a fellow like Merriwell.  He must give me a chance to get even.\"  \"Hodge doesn't try to get Merriwell out again.\"  \"No.  He says he will not influence him to attend the gatherings.\"  \"What's the matter with Hodge?\"  \"I don't know.  He is ready enough to come himself.\"  It was true that Bart had positively refused to use his influence to induce Merriwell to attend again one of the secret parties.  He had been greatly moved by Frank's revelation, and he had resolved not to lead Frank into the path that was so fascinating and so dangerous for him.  He did not know that the evil was already done--the fever was burning in Merriwell's veins.  Frank had been waiting an opportunity to speak with Snell in private, and it came one day when he met the fellow on the grounds outside the academy.  \"Hello, Snell,\" he saluted.  \"I have been looking for you.\"  \"And I have been looking for you,\" said Wat, meaningly.  \"Why haven't you ever come round since that night?  Aren't you going to give a fellow a show to get square?\"  \"I am not going to play cards any more!\"  \"What?\" cried Wat, in apparent astonishment.  \"That beats anything I ever heard!  You have beaten me out of a good roll, and now----\"  \"I have been looking for you that I might return every cent you lost that night, so you cannot consider me mean if I do not give you a chance to get even over the table.  If you will tell me just how much you dropped, I'll make it good now.\"  An eager look came to Wat's face, but it quickly vanished, for he realized that he would defeat himself if he accepted the money.  \"What do you take me for!\" he cried, with apparent indignation.  \"I am not that kind of a fellow!\"  \"You need never fear that I will say anything about it, for I pledge you my word of honor to say nothing.  All I want is to make sure you do not feel that I have any money that belongs to you.\"  \"I don't care whether you say anything about it or not, Merriwell. That does not keep me from accepting the money.  I tell you I am not that kind of a fellow.  You won it, and you will keep it, unless you have nerve enough to give me an opportunity to win it back.\"  This did not suit Frank at all, for the money had lain like a load on his conscience.  He had sworn not to gamble again, and he had broken his oath.  But, what was worse, so long as he kept that money, he felt that he really ought to give Snell a chance to get square.  There seemed but one way to get out of playing again, and that was to make Snell take back the money.  But it was useless for him to urge Wat; not a dollar would the fellow accept.  \"You can't give me back anything,\" declared Snell.  \"You won that money by having the most nerve--at that time.  But you can't repeat the trick, old man,\" he added, jovially.  \"Come around to-night, and see if you can.\"  Frank shook his head.  \"No,\" he declared, \"I shall not come.\"  \"Oh, what's the use, Merriwell!  We want you to come, and all the fellows are saying it is not like you to win a few dollars and then stay away.  I have told them over and over that I do not believe you are staying away because you are afraid I will win the money back. You're not that kind of a fellow.\"  At that moment Snell seemed very sincere, and Frank said:  \"Thank you.  I am glad to know you do not believe such a thing possible of me.  Still, I shall not come.\"  \"Oh, yes you will!\" laughed Wat.  \"It can't be that you're afraid of being caught.  If anybody says so, I'll swear I know better.  You have nerve enough not to care for that.  Come around to-night.  We'll look for you.\"  Snell hurried away, knowing full well that he had said things which must worry Merriwell, if they did not drive him into coming to the midnight card parties.  Wat was right.  Frank was worried not a little, for he could not bear to fancy that some of the boys thought him mean in staying away.  Hodge saw Merriwell was troubled, but the dark-haired boy remained silent.  In the meantime, finding Hodge would do nothing to bring Merriwell round.  Gage and Snell tried their best to make friends with Hans Dunnerwust and Barney Mulloy, as these boys were particular friends of Merriwell's, and might be induced to use some influence over him.  Barney, however, was wary.  He did not fancy either Gage or Snell, and he repulsed their advances.  To Hans, the temptation of a midnight supper on cakes and pies was too much to resist, and he was added to the circle that gathered in the room of the suicide.  Hans could play poker, and the game being made small enough to suit him, he came in and won about two dollars, which made him swell up like a toad, and declared:  \"Uf you poys know some games vot I can play petter as dot boker, shust you name him, und I vill do you at dot.  Oh, I vose a dandy on trucks, ain'd it?  Shust keep your eye on me, und I vill learn some tricks vot you don'd know alretty yet.\"  Snell did his best to make Hans believe he was a great favorite, and then he told him how Frank had won the only time he had appeared in the game, and had never come around since.  \"Some of the fellows seem to think he is afraid I will win the money back,\" said Wat; \"but I don't take any stock in that, for Merriwell's not that kind of a fellow.  Still, I don't like to have such ideas concerning him get into circulation.\"  \"Dot vos vere I vos righdt,\" nodded Hans.  \"He don't peen dot kindt uf a feller ad all, you pet me my shirt!  Dot Vrankie Merrivell vos a taisy, undt he don'd peen afrait a show to gif anypody.  You vait till I tell him vot dose fellers say.  I pet me your life he vill gome aroundt bretty kuveek righdt avay.\"  \"Oh, don't say anything about it!\" exclaimed Snell, as if he really wished Hans to keep silent.  \"Merriwell knows his business.  His friends will stand up for him, no matter what others may say.\"  \"Vell, I vos going to toldt him dot shust der same.  Uf he don'd peen aroundt here der next dime, I don'd know der kindt uv a feller vot he vos peen yet avile.\"  \"Well, don't mention that I said anything.  He might fancy I thought him afraid to come round.\"  \"I don'd call your name at all, don'd you let me vorry apout dot.\"  Snell knew the Dutch boy would lose little time in communicating with Frank, and he was right.  Hans did not see that Frank was little like his usual jovial self, and he did not know in what a turbulent state of mind the unfortunate plebe was left.  Bart was not a little worried over Frank, for he saw how the lad had changed in a short time, but he hoped that Merriwell would come round in time, and be his old jolly self.  That evening, a short while before taps, Frank asked:  \"I suppose it is another card party to-night?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Bart, \"a few of us are going to get together.\"  \"Will Snell be there?\"  \"I presume so.\"  No more was said.  Bart rose and slipped out of the room at the usual time, thinking Frank was asleep.  But Frank was not asleep, and Hodge was scarcely gone when he, too, arose and began to arrange a dummy in his bed.     CHAPTER VIII.  THE HAUNTED ROOM.  The little party of card players was expectantly awaiting the appearance of Bartley Hodge.  There was to be no feast this night--nothing but cigarettes and draw poker.  Hodge appeared at last, and he brought a disappointment to at least two of the party, for Frank Merriwell was not with him.  Leslie Gage and Wat Snell exchanged glances that were full of meaning.  Sam Winslow was on guard outside, it being his turn to fill that unenviable position.  \"Hello, Hodge,\" saluted Harvey Dare.  \"Now we are ready to proceed to business.\"  \"Dot vas righdt,\" nodded Hans Dunnerwust, who was on hand.  \"I vos goin' to smoke cigarreds to-nighd dill I vos sick, und haf a pully dime.\"  \"Why doesn't Merriwell ever show up again?\" asked Leslie Gage.  \"That's it,\" joined in Wat Snell, \"why doesn't he come round and give a fellow a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19502"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Chums (#6)"],["body","to win back some of that money he won off us?  Is he afraid?\"  \"You know well enough that Frank Merriwell is not afraid,\" said Bart, quickly.  \"Well, it looks that way,\" declared Leslie.  \"Yes, it looks that way,\" echoed Wat.  \"Possibly he has too much sense to spend his nights here,\" said Hodge. \"If I had known that much, I wouldn't have gone back a class. Merriwell is in the first section, and he is making right along.\"  \"Well, he is a different fellow than I thought he was,\" asserted Snell. \"Until lately, he has seemed quite a fellow for sport, but he is degenerating into a drone.\"  \"Such drones are the fellows who get along well in school and in the world.\"  \"Bah!  Give me a fellow with blood in him!\" came contemptuously from Gage.  Leslie had grown desperate, having come to the conclusion that Frank was not to be cajoled into playing poker any more.  He now determined, of a sudden, that he would take another tack, and see if he could not anger Merriwell into coming.  Hodge remembered that Gage had tried to injure Frank in the past, and the dark-eyed plebe was ready to blaze forth in an instant.  Although he did not know it, Gage was treading on the very thin crust that covered a smoldering volcano.  Leslie was not warned by the fire that gleamed in Bart's eyes, for he continued:  \"If Merriwell persists in staying away--if he does not show up and give Snell a chance to get square, he is----\"  A knock at the door!  It was the regular signal for admittance, and so, after the first start of alarm, George Harris said:  \"Open up quickly.  It must be Sam, and, if so, there's something wrong in the wind.\"  Wat Snell opened the door, and, to their amazement, into the room stepped Frank Merriwell!  It was with difficulty that the boys suppressed a shout of welcome.  Snell quickly closed the door, and then the boys rushed at Frank and shook his hand delightedly.  \"You're a sight for sore eyes!\" exclaimed Wat Snell, joyously.  \"Dot vos so!\" agreed Hans.  \"You vould peen a sighd for a plind man!\"  \"I will take back anything I said, and swallow what I was going to say,\" came from Leslie Gage.  \"I didn't think it could be possible you wouldn't come round again, old man.\"  \"Now, we will have a jolly little racket,\" said George Harris.  \"And you want to look out for Merriwell.  He is a great bluffer.\"  \"But he doesn't bluff all the time,\" supplemented Harvey Dare.  \"I found out that he held cards occasionally, for I called him a few the last time he was around.\"  Frank laughed; it was his old, jolly laugh, suppressed somewhat.  He seemed like himself once more, as Bart Hodge instantly noted.  He had cast off the strain under which he had been for so long, and now Frank Merriwell, mischievous and full of fun, was on deck again.  But this did not quite please Hodge, who watched his roommate closely, his uneasiness growing as he saw how care-free Merriwell seemed.  What had brought about such a change?  Had Frank thrown his resolutions to the wind?  \"I've got a supply of coffin-nails,\" said Snell, as he produced several packages of cigarettes.  \"Help yourselves, gentlemen.  Pass them round.\"  Round they went, and when they reached Frank Merriwell he accepted one.  \"I am going to be real dissipated to-night,\" he laughed, as he struck a match and \"fired up.\"  \"You may have to carry me to my room on a shutter, for I actually am going to smoke!\"  Leslie Gage and Wat Snell exchanged glances of satisfaction.  A black look came to Bart Hodge's face, and he half started up as Frank took the cigarette, acting as if he would utter a warning.  Then he settled back in his seat, thinking:  \"Let him smoke, if he wants to.  One cigarette will do nobody harm.\"  But Hodge knew in his heart that it was not the smoking of one or a dozen cigarettes that was dangerous to Merriwell; it was the breaking of his resolutions--it was the feeling of abandon and recklessness that had seemed to seize upon him.  Not much time was lost in beginning the game, but now Bart insisted on a proper limit.  \"What do you say, Merriwell?\" asked George Harris.  \"What kind of a limit suits you?\"  \"Anything from five cents to the sky,\" was the laughing reply.  \"Fix it to suit yourselves.\"  Once more Gage and Snell exchanged glances.  Bart stuck for a moderate limit, but he finally agreed to make it a dollar, the ante being five cents.  \"Vell, uf I had pad luck, I don'd last long at dot,\" said Hans.  \"I don'd haf more as four tollars und sefen cends.\"  \"Merriwell won at the start the last time he was here, and he kept the luck straight through to the finish,\" observed Harvey Dare.  \"It isn't often such a thing occurs.\"  A few minutes later, as Harris beat Frank, the latter said:  \"This game starts differently from the other, fellows.  I have lost at the beginning, and to keep up the precedent I have established, I must lose all through it.\"  He said this smilingly, as if he really wished to lose.  As the cards were being dealt, Bart, who sat by his roommate's side, leaned toward Frank, and softly asked:  \"What made you come, old man?\"  \"Couldn't keep away,\" was the reply.  \"Well, be careful--keep watch of yourself.\"  \"Not to-night, Bart.  I am going to let loose on this occasion.\"  Frank played recklessly from the start, and fortune fluctuated with him, for he would forge ahead and then drop behind, but he was never much ahead, nor far behind.  For all of his careless playing, he seemed to hang about even.  Leslie Gage was too shrewd to try to get at Frank on this occasion, for he wanted Merriwell to win again, so they would get a still firmer hold upon him.  Wat Snell lost steadily, soon beginning to growl, and keeping it up. Once, under cover of conversation the others were making, he leaned toward Gage and muttered:  \"Merriwell is my hoodoo.  I can't do a thing with him in the game.\"  \"Keep cool,\" warned Leslie.  \"Never mind what happens this time.  We'll get at him again.\"  Hans Dunnerwust managed to blunder along and keep in the game by sheer luck, for he did not play the cards for their face value at any time. Still he made enough to keep on his feet and not have to get out of the game.  \"Vell!\" Hans finally exclaimed, as he tried in vain to win, \"uf I don'd do petter as dot, I vill suicide go und gommit bretty soon alretty.\"  \"By the way, Hans,\" said Frank, \"do you know that the fellow who used to have this room committed suicide here?\"  \"Shimminy Gristmas!\" gurgled the Dutch boy.  \"You don'd say dot!\"  \"Yes, I do, and the room is said to be haunted by his spook, which cannot rest in its grave.\"  \"Vell, dot vos nice!  Oxcuse me while I haf a chill!\"  At this moment a hollow groan seemed to come from beneath the chair on which Hans sat, and the Dutch lad gave a jump, getting on his feet quickly, and peering under the chair, his face growing pale, as he chattered:  \"Vot vos dot, ain'd id?\"  Some of the other boys were not a little alarmed, for all had heard it distinctly.  \"It--it actually sounded like a groan!\" said Wat Snell.  \"That's what it did,\" agreed George Harris.  \"But you know it couldn't have been anything of the sort,\" laughed Frank, \"for you fellows do not believe in ghosts.\"  \"Who--who--who said anything about ghosts?\" stammered Snell.  At this moment another groan, louder and more dismal than the first, seemed to come from directly beneath the table.  There was a scrambling among the boys, as they hastened to get their legs from beneath that table.  \"I don'd feel very vell aroundt der bit uf mein stomach,\" gasped Hans. \"I pelief I vos going to be sick alretty yet.\"  One of the boys held the light, while they all looked under the table, but they did not find anything there.  \"Now, that is singular,\" commented Harvey Dare.  \"If that wasn't a groan, I never heard one in my life.\"  \"And a real ghostly groan at that!\" said Leslie Gage.  \"I never did take any stock in this rot about ghosts, but----\"  \"Beware, young man, how you mock at the spirits of the departed!\"  The voice seemed to come from one of the alcove bedrooms, and it was of the sort to make the hair stand on the head of a superstitious person.  \"Oh, dunder und blitzen!\" panted Hans.  \"Dot vos a shook!  Uf I don't ged avay oud uf here righd off, I peen gone grazy!  I don'd vant any shook in mine!\"  \"It is some fellow playing a joke on us,\" said Harvey Dare, angrily. \"Some one has concealed himself in there.  Bring the light, fellows, and we will soon find out.\"  He started for the alcove, but no one seemed anxious to take the light and follow him.  After a moment, however, Frank did so.  All through both alcoves Harvey searched, and his face was rather pale when he and Frank returned to the table.  \"What did you find?\" asked Wat Snell, thickly.  \"Not a thing but dust,\" replied Harvey.  \"There hasn't been a living soul in either of those bedrooms since the room was closed after the suicide.\"  \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the hollow voice.  \"You are right.  They dare not come, but I am doomed to stay here till this building shall crumble and decay.\"  \"Vell, you may sday till der cows come home!\" gurgled Hans; \"but I don'd peen caught in here any more bretty soon righd avay, you pet!\" and he made a break for the door.  The others quickly extinguished the light, and followed him.  There would be no more gatherings in that room.     CHAPTER IX.  IN THE MESHES.  Frank Merriwell fancied he had hit upon a scheme to stop the card games from which he could not remain away.  Being a skilled ventriloquist, he was the author of the dismal groans and the mysterious voice that had so alarmed the boys.  Bart was not in the secret, and so he wondered, when he heard Frank chuckling to himself, after they had safely reached their room and were getting into bed.  For several days the \"gang\" was disconsolate, having no place in which they could play a game of cards without fear of detection at any instant.  Frank Merriwell seemed restored to his usual jolly self.  He laughed and joked, and did not seem worried over"]]]
