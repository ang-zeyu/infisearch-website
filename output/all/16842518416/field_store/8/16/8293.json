The _y_ is not changed before _ship,_ as in _secretaryship, ladyship,_ etc., nor in _babyhood_ and _ladykin_.  4.  We have already seen that _y_ is not changed in derivatives when it is preceded by another vowel, as in the case of _joyful,_ etc.; but we find exceptions to this principle in _daily, laid, paid, said, saith, slain,_ and _staid_; and many write _gaily_ and _gaiety,_ though Webster prefers _gayly_ and _gayety_.  5.  Nouns of one syllable ending in _o_ usually take a silent _e_ also, as _toe, doe, shoe,_ etc, but other parts of speech do not take the _e,_ as _do, to, so, no,_ and the like, and nouns of more than one syllable, as _potato, tomato,_ etc., omit the _e_.  Monosyllables ending in _oe_ usually retain the silent _e_ in derivatives, and we have _shoeing, toeing,_ etc.  The commoner English nouns ending in _o_ also have the peculiarity of forming the plural by adding _es_ instead of _s,_ and we have _potatoes, tomatoes, heroes, echoes, cargoes, embargoes, mottoes_; but nouns a trifle more foreign form their plurals regularly, as _solos, zeros, pianos,_ etc.  When a vowel precedes the _o,_ the plural is always formed regularly.  The third person singular of the verb _woo_ is _wooes,_ of _do does,_ of _go goes,_ etc., in analogy with the plurals of the nouns ending in _o_.  6.  The following are exceptions to the rule that silent _e_ is retained in derivatives when the added syllable begins with a consonant: _judgment, acknowledgment, lodgment, wholly, abridgment, wisdom,_ etc.  7.  Some nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_ change those terminations to _ve_ in the plural, as _beef——beeves, leaf——leaves, knife——knives, loaf——loaves, life——lives, wife——wives, thief——thieves, wolf——wolves, self——selves, shelf——shelves, calf——calves, half——halves, elf——elves, sheaf——sheaves_. We have _chief——chiefs_ and _handkerchief——handkerchiefs,_ however, and the same is true of all nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_ except those given above.  8.  A few nouns form their plurals by changing a single vowel, as _man——men, woman——women, goose——geese, foot——feet, tooth——teeth,_ etc. Compounds follow the rule of the simple form, but the plural of _talisman_ is _talismans,_ of _German_ is _Germans,_ of _musselman_ is _musselmans,_ because these are not compounds of _men_.  9.  A few plurals are formed by adding _en,_ as _brother——brethren, child——children, ox——oxen_.  10.  _Brother, pea, die,_ and _penny_ have each two plurals, which differ in meaning.  _Brothers_ refers to male children of the same parents, _brethren_ to members of a religious body or the like; _peas_ is used when a definite number is mentioned, _pease_ when bulk is referred to; _dies_ are instruments used for stamping, etc., _dice_ cubical blocks used in games of chance; _pennies_ refer to a given number of coins, _pence_ to an amount reckoned by the coins. _Acquaintance_ is sometimes used in the plural for _acquaintances_ with no difference of meaning.  11.  A few words are the same in the plural as in the singular, as _sheep, deer, trout,_ etc.  12.  Some words derived from foreign languages retain the plurals of those languages.  For example: datum——data criterion——criteria genus——genera larva——larvæ‎ crisis——crises matrix——matrices focus——foci monsieur——messieurs  13.  A few allow either a regular plural or the plural retained from the foreign language: formula——formulæ or formulas beau——beaux or beaus index——indices or indexes stratum——strata or stratums bandit——banditti or bandits cherub——cherubim or cherubs seraph——seraphim or seraphs  14.  In very loose compounds in which a noun is followed by an adjective or the like, the noun commonly takes the plural ending, as in _courts-martial, sons-in-law, cousins-german_.  When the adjective is more closely joined, the plural ending must be placed at the end of the entire word.  Thus we have _cupfuls, handfuls,_ etc.  Different Spellings for the same Sound.  Perhaps the greatest difficulty in spelling English words arises from the fact that words and syllables pronounced alike are often spelled differently, and there is no rule to guide us in distinguishing. In order to fix their spelling, in mind we should know what classes of words are doubtful, and when we come to them constantly refer to the dictionary.  To try to master these except in the connections in which we wish to use them the writer believes to be worse than folly. By studying such words in pairs, confusion is very likely to be fixed forever in the mind.  Most spelling-books commit this error, and so are responsible for a considerable amount of bad spelling, which their method has actually introduced and instilled into the child's mind.  Persons who read much are not likely to make these errors, since they remember words by the form as it appeals to the eye, not by the sound in which there is no distinction.  The study of such words should therefore be conducted chiefly while writing or reading, not orally.  While we must memorize, one at a time as we come to them in reading or writing, the words or syllables in which the same sound is represented by different spellings, still we should know clearly what classes of words to be on the lookout for.  We will now consider some of the classes of words in which a single syllable may be spelled in various ways.

A. Donohue & Co. Chicago Copyright 1916 by M. A. Donohue and Company      BY WAY of INTRODUCTION  [Illustration]   Nothing has ever been written that appeals to a child's nature more than \"A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES.\" It is written in a simple verse that a child can readily understand. It was one of the earlier efforts of the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, a Scotchman by birth, who, owing to ill-health, became a world traveler. During his travels he visited the United States, spending a year among our famous resorts. Later he visited Australia and the South Sea Islands, which climate agreed with him to such an extent that he finally settled down and made his home on the island of Samoa. He continued his travels from that point, often visiting the Hawaiian Islands, Australia and New Zealand. He formed a strong friendship for the natives of Samoa, and did a great deal to improve their conditions. He died on the island, and at his own request was buried on the top of one of its beautiful mountains, with the following lines upon his tomb:      _Here he lies, where he longed to be;     Home is the Sailor, home from the sea,     And the hunter home from the hill._  [Illustration]      CONTENTS  [Illustration]      BED IN SUMMER     YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT     PIRATE STORY     FAREWELL TO THE FARM     THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE     FAIRY BREAD     ESCAPE AT BEDTIME     A GOOD PLAY     MARCHING SONG     WHERE GO THE BOATS     THE HAYLOFT     AUNTIE'S SKIRTS     THE MOON     THE COW     FOREIGN LANDS     SYSTEM     AT THE SEASIDE     HAPPY THOUGHT     THE LAND OF NOD     WINDY NIGHTS     TIME TO RISE     RAIN     FOREIGN CHILDREN     LOOKING FORWARD     MY SHADOW     THE SUN'S TRAVELS     LOOKING-GLASS RIVER     THE LAMPLIGHTER     SINGING     TRAVEL     MY BED IS A BOAT     KEEPSAKE MILL     THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE     MY SHIP AND I     THE WIND     A GOOD BOY     GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN     PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER     THE SWING     A THOUGHT     ARMIES IN THE FIRE     MY KINGDOM     SHADOW MARCH     WINTER-TIME     THE LITTLE LAND     IN PORT     NIGHT AND DAY     NEST EGGS     THE FLOWERS     FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE     MY TREASURES     BLOCK CITY     THE GARDENER     A CHILD'S GARDEN of VERSES  [Illustration]  BED IN SUMMER       In winter I get up at night,     And dress by yellow candle light.     In summer quite the other way,     I have to go to bed by day.      I have to go to bed and see     The birds still hopping on the tree,     Or hear the grown-up people's feet,     Still going past me in the street.  [Illustration]      And does it not seem hard to you,     When all the sky is clear and blue,     And I should like so much to play,     To have to go to bed by day?     YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT       All night long and every night,     When my mamma puts out the light     I see the people marching by,     As plain as day, before my eye.      Armies and emperors and kings,     All carrying different kinds of things,     And marching in so grand a way,     You never saw the like by day.      So fine a show was never seen     At the great circus on the green;     For every kind beast and man     Is marching in that caravan.      At first they move a little slow,     But still the faster on they go,     And still beside them close I keep     Until we reach the Town of Sleep.  [Illustration]     PIRATE STORY       Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing.     Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.     Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,     And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.      Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,       Wary of the weather and steering by a star?     Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,       To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?      Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--       Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!     Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,     The wicket is the harbor and the garden is the shore.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     FAREWELL TO THE FARM       The coach is at the door at last;     The eager children, mounting fast     And kissing hands, in chorus sing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      To house and garden, field and lawn,     The meadow-gates we swung upon,     To pump and stable, tree and swing,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      And fare you well for evermore,     O ladder at the hayloft door,     O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      Crack goes the whip, and off we go;     The trees and houses smaller grow;     Last, round the woody turn we swing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE       When I was sick and lay a-bed,     I had two pillows at my head,     And all my toys beside me lay     To keep me happy all the day.      And sometimes for an hour or so     I watched my leaden soldiers go,     With different uniforms and drills,     Among the bed-clothes, through the hills.      And sometimes sent my ships in fleets     All up and down among the sheets;     Or brought my trees and houses out,     And planted cities all about.      I was the giant great and still     That sits upon the pillow-hill,     And sees before him, dale and plain     The pleasant Land of Counterpane.  [Illustration]      Come up here, O dusty feet!       Here is fairy bread to eat      Here in my retiring room,       Children, you may dine      On the golden smell of broom       And the shade of pine      And when you have eaten well,       Fairy stories hear and tell.  [Illustration]     ESCAPE AT BEDTIME       The lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out       Through the blinds and the windows and bars;     And high over head and all moving about,       There were thousands of millions of stars.     There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,       Nor of people in church or the Park,     As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,       And that glittered and winked in the dark.      The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter and all,       And the star of the sailor, and Mars,     These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall       Would be half full of water and stars.     They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,       And they soon had me packed into bed;     But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,     And the stars going round in my head.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     A GOOD PLAY       We built a ship upon the stairs     All made of the back-bedroom chairs,     And filled it full of sofa pillows     To go a-sailing on the billows.      We took a saw and several nails,     And water in the nursery pails;     And Tom said, \"Let us also take     An apple and a slice of cake;\"--     Which was enough for Tom and me     To go a-sailing on, till tea.      We sailed along for days and days,     And had the very best of plays;     But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,     So there was no one left but me.  [Illustration]     MARCHING SONG       Bring the comb and play upon it!       Marching, here we come!     Willie cocks his highland bonnet,       Johnnie beats the drum.      Mary Jane commands the party,       Peter leads the rear;     Feet in time, alert and hearty,       Each a Grenadier!      All in the most martial manner       Marching double-quick;     While the napkin like a banner       Waves upon the stick!      Here's enough of fame and pillage,       Great commander Jane!     Now that we've been round the village,       Let's go home again.  [Illustration: \"_Boats of mine a-boating_\"]     WHERE GO THE BOATS?       Dark brown is the river,         Golden is the sand.     It flows along for ever,         With trees on either hand.      Green leaves a-floating,         Castles of the foam,     Boats of mine a-boating--         Where will all come home?      On goes the river         And out past the mill,     Away down the valley,         Away down the hill.      Away down the river,         A hundred miles or more,     Other little children         Shall bring my boats ashore.     THE HAYLOFT       Through all the pleasant meadow-side       The grass grew shoulder-high,     Till the shining scythes went far and wide       And cut it down to dry.      These green and sweetly smelling crops       They led in wagons home;     And they piled them here in mountain-tops       For mountaineers to roam.      Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,       Mount Eagle and Mount High;--     The mice that in these mountains dwell,       No happier are than I!      O what a joy to clamber there,       O what a place for play,     With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,       The happy hills of hay!  [Illustration]     AUNTIE'S SKIRTS       Whenever Auntie moves around       Her dresses make a curious sound.     They trail behind her up the floor,       And trundle after through the door.  [Illustration]     THE MOON       The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;     She shines on thieves on the garden wall,     On streets and fields and harbor quays,     And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.      The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,     The howling dog by the door of the house,     The bat that lies in bed at noon,     All love to be out by the light of the moon.      But all of the things that belong to the day     Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;     And flowers and children close their eyes     Till up in the morning the sun shall rise.
