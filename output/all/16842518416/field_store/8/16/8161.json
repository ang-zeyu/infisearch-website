Jasper scrawled his name hurriedly and tore open the envelope.  These were the brief words of the dispatch:      \"Come home, for the Lord's sake, Master Jasper. Your father's dying.      \"Margaret Bower.\"  The paper swam before Jasper's eyes.  \"What is it, Jasper--bad news?\" asked Wilder; but Jasper did not wait to answer. He rushed to Dr. Benton's office, got his permission to go home, packed his valise, and in five minutes was on his way to the depot.  He was just in time for the afternoon train. At seven o'clock in the evening he entered the avenue that led to his father's house. Throwing open the front door, he met Margaret in the hall.  \"I'm glad you're here, Master Jasper,\" said the faithful handmaiden, heartily.  \"Is it too late?\"  \"I hope not; indeed, I hope not.\"  Jasper waited for no more, but rushed up stairs and into his father's room.  There were two persons there--the step-mother and a man of thirty, with black whiskers and sallow complexion, with whom she was talking earnestly. They, started when Jasper entered, and looked discouraged. Mrs. Kent looked displeased and annoyed.  \"How is my father?\" exclaimed Jasper, excitedly.  \"Hush! He is very low,\" said Mrs. Kent \"You shouldn't have dashed in here so abruptly.\"  \"Is there no hope for him?\" asked the boy, sorrowfully.  \"No, my young friend,\" said the man, smoothly. \"All has been done that human skill can do, but without avail.\"  \"Are you the doctor?\"  \"I am.\"  \"Where is Dr. Graham, my father's old doctor?\"  \"I dismissed him,\" said his step-mother, \"He was not competent to attend so critical a case. This is Dr. Kenyon.\"  \"I never before heard Dr. Graham's skill doubted,\" said Jasper. \"Is my father conscious?\"  \"No; he is under the influence of morphine. Do not wake him up.\"  \"Was he, then, in great pain?\"  \"Yes, in great pain.\"  Quietly Jasper drew near the bedside.  His father lay unconscious, his form rigid, his face thin and betraying marks of weariness and suffering. The tears rose to the eyes of Jasper as he realized that his father was passing away. As he looked on there was a slight convulsive movement; then repose. In that one moment his father had passed on to another world.  The doctor had approached the bedside also, and he, too, saw the movement.  \"He is dead!\" he announced.  \"Dead!\" repeated Mrs. Kent, in a voice rather of surprise than of sorrow.  \"Yes.\"  \"Well,\" she said, coolly, \"we must all die. We have the satisfaction of knowing that we have done all we could do to preserve his life.\"  \"Certainly, my dear madam; you may comfort yourself by that thought,\" said the physician.  \"Why did you not send for me before?\" asked Jasper, turning with moist eyes to his step-mother, \"that I might see my father before he died?\"  \"We could not foresee his sudden death,\" said Mrs. Kent. \"How do you happen to be here this afternoon?\"  \"Didn't you direct Margaret to telegraph for me?\" asked Jasper, surprised.  \"Did Margaret take upon herself to telegraph to you?\" asked Mrs. Kent, in a tone of displeasure.  \"Yes,\" said Jasper, bitterly. \"Did you mean to keep me wholly unacquainted with my father's illness?\"  \"No; I wrote a line this afternoon, which I should have sent to the office at once.\"  \"When it was too late!\"  \"Your reproaches are unseemly and uncalled for,\" said his step-mother, quite coldly.  \"I think differently,\" said Jasper, bitterly. \"You should have sent for me as soon as my father got worse than usual.\"  \"In consideration of your grief I will overlook your impertinence,\" said Mrs. Kent, compressing her thin lips, as she left the room.  The doctor followed her out, and Jasper was left alone with the dead.  He did not realize it, but his father's death was to seriously affect his fortunes.     CHAPTER IX.  A DECLARATION OF WAR.   Half an hour later Jasper left the room where his father lay dead. He did not seek the presence of his step-mother, who, he felt, had done him wrong in keeping from him his father's condition. He went instead to the kitchen, where he found Margaret.  \"This is a sad day for you, Master Jasper,\" said the sympathizing servant.  \"It is, indeed, Margaret. I have lost my best friend.\"  \"True for you.\"  \"But for your telegram, I should not have known even now that he was dangerously ill, I thought at first Mrs. Kent asked you to telegraph.\"  \"No, she didn't. I asked her would she send for you, and she told me it was none of my business.\"  \"It was lucky you didn't heed her,\" said Jasper. \"She is a cold, unfeeling woman.\"  \"That she is, Master Jasper,\" assented Margaret, with emphasis.  \"How long has my father been so sick?\"  \"For a week or more, but he took a sudden turn at the last. I think he got worse after the new doctor came.\"  \"I wanted to ask you about that. Why was Dr. Graham dismissed? He has attended my father for years.\"  \"Shall I tell you what I think, Master Jasper?\" said Margaret, stopping short in her work, and looking mysterious.  \"Yes.\"  \"Let me whisper it, then. Come nearer, Master Jasper.\"  Rather surprised at her manner, Jasper obeyed.  \"It's my belief,\" she whispered, \"that your step-mother didn't want your father to get well.\"  Jasper looked horror-struck.  \"Are you crazy, Margaret?\" he ejaculated.  She nodded her head positively.  \"I know what I'm saying,\" she answered.  \"But what can make you believe such a horrible thing?\" he asked.  She answered in the same low voice:  \"A month ago she got your father to make his will. What there is in it I don't know, but it is likely it suits her. After that she had nothing to gain by his living.\"  \"You don't think she'd--\" Jasper hesitated to proceed.  \"Poison him? No, I don't. It wasn't needful; but your papa was that delicate, it would be enough if he was not rightly treated, and I don't believe this new doctor did the right thing by him. Dr. Graham and Mrs. Kent never could agree, but she and the new doctor have been as thick as can be. They understand one another, I'll be bound.\"  Jasper looked shocked, and was silent for a moment.  \"I don't like Mrs. Kent,\" he said, \"but, Margaret, I hope you're wrong in this. That any one could wish my dear, gentle father dead I find it hard to believe.\"  \"You haven't seen as much of your step-mother as I have, Master Jasper.\"  \"Heaven grant you are wrong, Margaret! If I thought it were true I should never want to look at the woman again.\"  \"Hush!\" said Margaret, suddenly putting her hand on her lip.  Jasper understood her caution, when he saw his step-mother enter the kitchen. She looked from one to the other with a suspicious glance.  \"This is a strange place for you, Jasper,\" said she, in slow, cold accents.  \"I don't see why, madam,\" he answered, in a voice equally cold.  \"I find you--a young gentleman--conferring with a servant.\"  \"With a trusted servant, who has been in our family for years. Nothing could be more natural.\"  \"I don't agree with you,\" said Mrs. Kent, in a chilly tone.  \"I am unfortunate in not winning your approbation,\" said Jasper, not caring to suppress the sarcasm.  \"It strikes me you are impertinent,\" said Mrs. Kent.  She had thrown off the mask. During her husband's life she had taken special pains to be polite to Jasper, though in so doing she did violence to her feelings. There was no more to be gained by it, and she had changed suddenly. Jasper could not help alluding to it.  \"How happens it, madam,\" he said, \"that your treatment of me has changed so entirely since my father's death? Brief as the interval is, you have lost no time.\"  There was hatred in the glance she shot at him.  \"I was silent out of regard to your father, who was blind to your faults,\" she answered. \"You must not expect me to be equally blind.\"  \"I don't, madam.\"  \"Do you intend to remain in the kitchen?\" demanded Mrs. Kent  \"I was questioning Margaret about my father's last days.\"  \"I am the proper one to question.\"  \"Would you have afforded me the information I desired?\"  \"If the questions you asked were of a proper character.\"  \"Mrs. Kent, I will take you at your word. How does it happen that you dismissed Dr. Graham, my father's old family physician?\"  His step-mother hesitated and looked angry, but she replied, after a brief pause:  \"He did not understand the case.\"  \"What makes you think so? He certainly ought to understand my father's constitution.\"  \"Perhaps he ought, but he didn't,\" said Mrs. Kent, sharply.  \"You haven't given any reason.\"  \"I have given all I choose. I don't mean to be catechised by a boy.\"  \"Who is this Dr. Kenyon whom you called in afterward?\"  \"A very skilful physician.\"  \"He looks young.\"  \"He has a high reputation.\"  \"When did he assume charge of my father's case?\"  \"A week ago.\"  \"And since then he has grown steadily worse.\"  \"Who told you that?\" demanded Mrs. Kent, sharply.  \"Is it not true?\"  \"Did Margaret tell you this?\"  \"I did,\" said Margaret, quietly.  \"I shall remember this,\" said Mrs. Kent, spitefully.  \"I didn't need to ask Margaret,\" said Jasper, \"when my father lies dead after a week's treatment by this skilful physician.\"  Mrs. Kent was white with anger.  \"You ought to know that life and death are in the power of no doctor,\" she said, for, angry as she was, she saw that it was necessary to reply to what Jasper said. \"In sending for Dr. Kenyon I did not much expect that he would cure your father, but I felt that it was my duty to give him this last chance. Unfortunately he was too far gone.\"  \"You thought that matters were as bad as that a week ago, and yet you didn't send for me?\" exclaimed Jasper.  \"It would have done no good,\" said she, coldly.  \"But it would have been a satisfaction to me to see something of him in his last sickness. Mrs. Kent, you haven't treated me right in this matter.\"  \"Is that the way for a boy to talk to his--elder?\"  \"Yes, if he says only what is strictly true.\"  \"I shall not continue this conversation,\" said Mrs. Kent, haughtily, \"nor shall I submit to be talked to in this style. It is not for your interest to make me your enemy,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19592"],["title","Frank and Fearless; or, The Fortunes of Jasper Kent (#7)"],["body","added, significantly.  Jasper was frank and fearless by temperament, and anything in the shape of a menace roused his high spirit.  \"That consideration doesn't weigh with me a particle,\" he said, hastily.  \"We will see,\" she retorted, and with a look of anger she swept from the room.  \"Margaret,\" said Jasper, abruptly, \"did you go into my father's sick-chamber at any time?\"  \"Yes, Master Jasper.\"  \"Did you ever hear my father inquire after me?\"  \"I heard him say more than once, with a sigh like, that he wished to see you.\"  \"And she wouldn't send for me!\" exclaimed Jasper, bitterly.  \"She always opposed it, saying it wouldn't do no good, and would only take you off your studies.\"  \"Much she cared for my studies! Margaret, I will never forgive that woman, never!\"  \"Well, I can't blame you, Master Jasper.\"  Here Margaret heard her name called in a loud voice, and was forced to obey.  \"She wants to separate us,\" thought Jasper, as he slowly and sadly went up to his own chamber.     CHAPTER X.  NICHOLAS APPEARS UPON THE SCENE.   The funeral was over. Mrs. Kent was considered by those present to display a great deal of fortitude. As she felt no real grief for the death of her husband, this was not remarkable. Jasper looked pale and sorrowful, but gave way to no violent demonstrations of sorrow, though he began to understand that he had not only lost his best friend, but become at the same time exposed to the machinations of a resolute and relentless enemy.  In due time the will was read.  It was very brief, and clear in its provisions.  To Mrs. Kent was left one-third of the estate, real and personal, of which the deceased was possessed, and the balance was willed to his only child and dear son Jasper, of whom his step-mother was left guardian.  When this clause was read Mrs. Kent directed a brief and triumphant glance at Jasper. He met the glance, and understood what it meant. He knew that it boded him no good.  The company assembled gradually dispersed, and Jasper was left alone with his step-mother.  \"You see that I am left your guardian,\" she said.  \"Yes,\" answered Jasper, briefly.  \"Perhaps you would have chosen a different one if the choice had been left to you,\" she continued, with a sneer.  \"I should,\" said Jasper, promptly.  \"Well, that is plain language.\"  \"I suppose you expected a plain answer,\" said the boy, firmly.  \"I did not expect a polite one. You appear to forget that I am a lady.\"  \"You are mistaken, madam. I am ready to treat you as well as you treat me. I won't pretend that I like your guardianship, as I fear that we shall not agree.\"  \"If we don't, you will have to yield,\" said his step-mother.  \"I would rather not dispute till it is absolutely necessary,\" said Jasper. \"May I ask whether you desire me to return to school?\"  \"I have not made up my mind. I may be able to tell you to-morrow.\"  \"Until you make up your mind you expect me to remain at home, I suppose?\"  \"Yes.\"  Jasper bowed and turned away. He went down stairs into the hall just as the front door was opened, and the familiar voice of Nicholas Thorne was heard. Jasper stared in some surprise at the intruder, not knowing that he was expected.  \"Halloo, Jasper!\" said Thorne, boisterously. \"How are you?\"  \"I am well,\" said Jasper, distantly.  \"Where's mother?\"  \"Your mother? Your aunt, you mean.\"  \"No, I don't. That's all gammon. She's my mother.\"  \"She is!\" exclaimed Jasper. \"What made you deny it, then?\"  \"Policy,\" said Thorne, laughing. \"Your father might not have liked it. Now it's all right.\"  \"Did your mother send for you?\" asked Jasper.  \"Yes, of course she did. This is to be my home now.\"  Jasper made no comment. What could he say? If Thorne were his step-mother's son, it was only natural that he should live in the house of which she was mistress.  But it seemed to him as if he were being pushed out of his own father's house, and these strangers were coming in to occupy it He felt that it would no longer seem like home to him.  \"Well, where's my mother?\" asked Thorne.  \"She's up stairs. Shall I show you the way?\"  \"If you're a mind to. I guess I'll know my own way round here pretty soon.\"  \"What a detestable fellow!\" thought Jasper. \"I am afraid we shall quarrel soon.\"  He led the way up stairs, and ushered Nicholas into his mother's presence.  This uncouth boy was the one object this selfish woman loved. She uttered an exclamation of delight.  \"Welcome home, my dear Nicholas!\" she exclaimed, advancing hastily and throwing her arms round his neck.  He received the embrace apathetically, but made no opposition, as at another time he might have done. He felt on good terms with his mother and the whole world, in the face of the brilliant improvement of his prospects.  \"Are you well, my dear boy?\" asked Mrs. Kent.  \"Oh, I'm well enough, mother. This is a splendid old place, isn't it?\"  Mrs. Kent laughed at Jasper.  \"Yes, it is a fine country-place.\"  Jasper left the two, and went down stairs.  \"Say, mother, how about the will?\" asked Thorne. \"Is it all right?\"  \"A third of the estate is left to me.\"  \"Only a third! Does Jasper get the rest?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That's a shame. You ought to have had half.\"  \"I shall have control of the whole till Jasper is of age. I am left his guardian.\"  \"That's good, anyhow. You must make him toe the mark, mother.\"  \"I mean to.\"  \"He's always had his own way, and he may give you trouble. He feels high and mighty. I can tell you.\"  \"I shall know how to deal with him,\" said Mrs. Kent, closing her thin lips resolutely. \"He will find me as firm as himself.\"  \"I guess that's so, mother. You'll prove a tough customer.\"  Mrs. Kent smiled, as if she enjoyed the compliment.  \"I'll stand by you, mother. If you have any trouble, just call me in.\"  \"I don't expect to need any help, Nicholas; but I am glad to find I have a brave son, who will stand by his mother.\"  Certainly no one believed in Nicholas so thoroughly as his mother. To the world generally he was a cowardly bully, rough, brutal, and selfish. In his mother's eyes he was manly and a paragon of youthful virtue. I have already said that Thorne's affection for his mother was far less disinterested, as is very apt to be the case with boys. His intention to benefit by the change of circumstances was shown at once.  \"What allowance are you going to give me, mother?\" he asked.  \"I have not thought, yet, Nicholas.\"  \"Then I want you to think, mother.\"  \"How much do you want?\"  \"I want as much as Jasper gets.\"  \"You shall receive as much,\" said his mother, promptly. \"Do you know how much he has received?\"  \"Yes--he has had five dollars a week.\"  \"That's too much.\"  \"It isn't too much for me.\"  \"I shall reduce his allowance to three dollars a week.\"  \"You don't expect me to get along on three dollars?\" grumbled Thorne.  \"I will give you five.\"  \"And Jasper only three?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Won't he be mad!\" exclaimed Nicholas, with malicious satisfaction. \"What'll you say to him about it?\"  \"I shall merely announce my decision,\" said Mrs. Kent, coolly. \"I am not bound to assign any reasons.\"  \"Won't there be a precious row!\" said Thorne.  \"I presume he will complain, but he has not conducted himself toward me in a manner to secure any favors.\"  \"I say, mother, can you give me my first week's allowance in advance? I'm awful hard up.\"  \"Here, my son,\" said Mrs. Kent, drawing out her pocket-book and placing a five-dollar bill in her son's hand.  \"Good for you, mother. When are you going to have supper?\"  \"In an hour.\"  \"How much property did the old man leave?\"  \"The estate is probably fully up to one hundred thousand dollars. This place is worth fifteen thousand. The rest is in good interest-paying stocks and bonds.\"  \"And a third belongs to you! I say, mother, you've feathered your nest well. I guess I'll go out and take a look round.\"  In the rear of the house, in front of the stable, Nicholas caught sight of Jasper.  He smiled maliciously.  \"I'll go and tell him about the reduction in his allowance,\" he said to himself.     CHAPTER XI.  THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES.   Jasper was quietly thinking over his change of circumstances when he was roused by a rather violent slap on the shoulder.  Turning hastily, he saw that it was Nicholas.  \"I say, this is a jolly place, Jasper,\" said Thorne.  \"Yes,\" said Jasper. \"It has been my home as far back as I can remember.\"  \"That's where you have the advantage of me, but after all it doesn't make much difference, as long as it's going to be my home now.\"  Jasper didn't reply.  \"I say, Kent, it seems odd that me and you are brothers,\" said Thorne, not very grammatically.  \"We are not,\" said Jasper, quickly.  \"It's all the same--we've got the same mother.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said Jasper, coldly.  \"You know what I mean. She's my mother and your step-mother.\"  \"That's very different. Besides, the relationship is so very recent that I find it hard to think of your mother as any relation at all.\"  \"She is, though. I suppose me and you will be a good deal together now.\"  \"I don't know what my future plans will be,\" said Jasper, not very much elated by this prospect.  \"No, I suppose not. Mother'll arrange about them. How much allowance did your father use to give you?\"  Jasper thought at first of refusing to reply, but it occurred to him that under the new and strange circumstances it was not an improper question for Nicholas to ask. He therefore decided to reply.  \"Five dollars a week,\" he answered.  \"When was it paid?\"  \"On Saturday.\"  \"See here,\" said Thorne, drawing from his vest pocket the five-dollar bill his mother had given him.  \"What of it?\" said Jasper.  \"It's my allowance for this week,\" said Thorne, triumphantly.  \"I congratulate you,\" said Jasper, coldly.  \"That's kind in you,\" returned Thorne, with a sneer, \"especially as you are cut down.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Jasper, hastily.  \"Mother says five dollars a week is too much for you. She's going to cut you down to three.\"  The indignant color came to Jasper's cheek. Was this "]]]
