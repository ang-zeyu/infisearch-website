Jimmy's Choice.   One limpin Jimmy wed a lass; An this wor th' way it coom to pass-- He'd saved a little bit o' brass,    An soa he thowt he'd ventur To tak unto hissen a wife, To ease his mind ov all its strife, An be his comfort all throo life--    An, pray, what should prevent her?  \"Awve brass enuff,\" he sed, \"for two, An noa wark at awm foorced to do, But all th' day long can bill an coo,    Just like a little pigeon. Aw nivver have a druffen rant; Aw nivver praich teetotal cant; Aw nivver booast at awm a saint,    I' matters o' religion.  \"Then with a gradely chap like me, A lass can live mooast happily; An awl let all awr neighbors see    We'll live withaat a wrangle; For if two fowk just have a mind To be to one another kind, They each may be as easy twined    As th' hannel ov a mangle.  \"For love's moor paar nor oaths an blows, An kind words, ivverybody knows, Saves monny a hundred thaasand rows;    An soa we'll start wi kindness; For if a chap thinks he can win Love or respect wi oaths an din, He'll surely find he's been let in,    An sarved reight for his blindness.\"  Soa Jimmy went to tell his tale To a young lass called Sally Swale, An just for fear his heart should fail,    He gate a drop o' whiskey. Net mich, but just enuff, yo see, To put a spark into his e'e, An mak his tongue a trifle free,    An mak him strong an frisky.  Young Sally, shoo wor varry shy, An when he'd done shoo breathed a sigh, An then began to sob an cry    As if her heart wor brokken. \"Nay, Sally lass,--pray what's amiss?\" He sed, an gave a lovin kiss, \"If awd expected owt like this,    Awm sewer awd ne'er ha spokken.\"  At last shoo dried her bonny een, An felt as praad as if a queen; An nivver king has ivver been    One hawf as praad as Jimmy. An soa they made all matters sweet, An one day quietly stroll'd up th' street, Till th' owd church door coom into seet--    Says Jim, \"Come, lass, goa wi me.\"  Then wed they wor an off they went To start ther life ov sweet content; An Sally ax'd him whear he meant    Ther honey-mooin to spend at? Says Jim, \"We're best at hooam, aw think, We've lots o' stuff to ait an drink.\" But Sally gave a knowin wink,    An sed, \"Nay, awl net stand that.  \"Tha needn't think aw meean to be Shut up like in a nunnery; Awm fond o' life, an love a spree,    As weel as onny other.\" \"Tha cannot goa,\" sed Jim, \"that's flat.\" \"But goa aw shall, awl tell thee that! What wod ta have a woman at?    Shame on thee for sich bother!\"  Jim scrat his heead, \"Nah lass,\" sed he, \"One on us mun a maister be, Or else we'st allus disagree,    An nivver live contented.\" Sed Sal, \"Awd ne'er a maister yet, An if tha thowt a slave to get, Tha'll find thisen mista'en, awl bet;    Awm sewer aw nivver meant it.\"  Jim tried his best to change her mind, But mud as weel ha saved his wind; An soa to prove he worn't unkind,    He gave in just to pleeas her. He's allus follow'd th' plan sin then, To help her just to pleeas hersen; An nah, he says, \"They're fooilish men    At wed a wife to teeas her.\"    Old Moorcock.   Awm havin a smook bi misel,    Net a soul here to spaik a word to, Awve noa gossip to hear nor to tell,    An ther's nowt aw feel anxious to do.  Awve noa noashun o' writin a line,    Tho' awve just dipt mi pen into th' ink, Towards warkin aw dooant mich incline,    An awm ommost too lazy to think.  Awve noa riches to mak me feel vain,    An yet awve as mich as aw need; Awve noa sickness to cause me a pain,    An noa troubles to mak mi heart bleed.  Awr Dolly's crept off to her bed,    An aw hear shoo's beginnin to snoor; (That upset me when furst we wor wed,    But nah it disturbs me noa moor.)  Like me, shoo taks things as they come,    Makkin th' best o' what falls to her lot, Shoo's content wi her own humble hooam,    For her world's i' this snug little cot.  We know at we're booath growin old,    But Time's traces we hardly can see; An tho' fifty years o'er us have roll'd,    Shoo's still th' same young Dolly to me.  Her face may be wrinkled an grey,    An her een may be losin ther shine, But her heart's just as leetsome to-day    As it wor when aw furst made her mine.  Awve mi hobbies to keep me i' toit,    Awve noa whistle nor bell to obey, Awve mi wark when aw like to goa to it,    An mi time's all mi own, neet an day.  An tho' some pass me by wi a sneer,    An some pity mi lowly estate, Aw think awve a deeal less to fear    Nor them at's soa wealthy an great.  When th' sky stretches aght blue an breet,    An th' heather's i' blossom all round, Makkin th' mornin's cooil breezes smell sweet,    As they rustle along ovver th' graand.  When aw listen to th' lark as he sings    Far aboon, ommost lost to mi view, Aw lang for a pair ov his wings,    To fly wi him, an sing like him, too.  When aw sit under th' shade of a tree,    Wi mi book, or mi pipe, or mi pen, Aw think them at's sooary for me    Had far better pity thersen.  When wintry storms howl ovver th' moor,    An snow covers all, far an wide, Aw carefully festen mi door,    An creep cloise up to th' fire inside.  A basin o' porridge may be,    To some a despisable dish, But it allus comes welcome to me,    If awve nobbut as mich as aw wish.  Mi cloas are old-fashioned, they say,    An aw havn't a daat but it's true; Yet they answer ther purpose to-day    Just as weel as if th' fashion wor new.  Let them at think joys nobbut dwell    Wheear riches are piled up i' stoor, Try to get a gooid share for thersel'    But leave me mi snug cot up o'th' moor.  Mi bacca's all done, soa aw'll creep    Off to bed, just as quite as a maase, For if Dolly's disturbed ov her sleep,    Ther'll be a fine racket i'th' haase.  Aw mun keep th' band i'th' nick if aw can,    For if shoo gets her temper once crost, All comforts an joys aw may plan    Is just soa mich labour at's lost.    Th' Short-Timer.   Some poets sing o' gipsy queens,    An some o' ladies fine; Aw'll sing a song o' other scenes,--    A humbler muse is mine. Jewels, an' gold, an silken frills,    Are things too heigh for me; But wol mi harp wi vigour thrills,    Aw'll strike a chord for thee.           Poor lassie wan,          Do th' best tha can,       Although thi fate be hard.          A time ther'll be          When sich as thee      Shall have yor full reward.  At hauf-past five tha leaves thi bed,    An off tha goes to wark; An gropes thi way to mill or shed,    Six months o'th' year i'th' dark. Tha gets but little for thi pains,    But that's noa fault o' thine; Thi maister reckons up _his_ gains,    An ligs i bed till nine.           Poor lassie wan, &c.  He's little childer ov his own    'At's quite as old as thee; They ride i' cushioned carriages    'At's beautiful to see; They'd fear to spoil ther little hand,    To touch thy greasy brat: It's wark like thine at makes em grand--    They nivver think o' that.           Poor lassie wan, &c.  I' summer time they romp an' play    Where flowers grow wild and sweet; Ther bodies strong, ther spirits gay,    They thrive throo morn to neet. But tha's a cough, aw hear tha has,    An oft aw've known thee sick; But tha mun work, poor little lass,    Foa hauf-a-craan a wick.           Poor lassie wan, &c.  Aw envy net fowks' better lot--    Aw shouldn't like to swap. Aw'm quite contented wi mi cot;    Aw'm but a workin chap. But if aw had a lot o' brass    Aw'd think o' them at's poor; Aw'd have yo' childer workin less,    An mak yor wages moor.           Poor lassie wan, &c.  \"There is a land of pure delight,    Where saints immortal reign, Infinite day excludes the night,    And pleasures banish pain.\" Noa fact'ry bell shall greet thi ear,    I' that sweet home ov love; An' those at scorn thi sufferins here    May envy thee above.           Poor lassie wan, &c.    Sol an' Doll.   Awm a young Yorksher lad as jolly an gay,    As a lark on a sunshiny mornin, An Dolly's as fair as the flaars i' May,    An trubbles we meean to be scornin. If we live wol to-morn aw shall make her mi wife,    An we'll donce to a rollickin measure, For we booath are agreed to begin wedded life,    As we mean to goa throo it, wi pleasure.        Then we'll donce an be gay,       An we'll laff care away,    An we'll nivver sit broodin o'er sorrow,       An mi Dolly an me,       Ax yo all to a spree;    Come an donce at awr weddin to-morrow.  Awst be bashful awm sewer, aw wor ne'er wed befoor,    An aw feel rayther funny abaat it; But Dolly aw guess can drag me aght o'th' mess,    An if ther's owt short we'll do baat it. Mi mother says \"Sol, if tha'll leave it to Doll,    Tha'll find shoo can taich thee a wrinkle, Shoo's expectin some fun befoor it's all done    Aw can tell, for aw saw her e'en twinkle.\"        Then we'll donce &c.  We've a haase to step in, all as smart as a pin,    An we've beddin an furnitur plenty; We've a pig an a caah, an aw connot tell ha    Monny paands, but aw think abaat twenty. We've noa family yet, but ther will be aw'll bet,    For true comfort aw think ther's nowt licks it An if they dooant come, aw'll just let it alooan,    An aw'll leave it for Dolly to fix it.        Then we'll donce &c.    Their Fred.   \"He's a nowt!    If ther's owt At a child shouldn't do,    He mun try,    Or know why, Befoor th' day's getten throo.

Th' swallows are buildin ther nests, Jenny,    Th' springtime has come with its flowers; Th' fields in ther greenest are drest, Jenny,    An th' songsters mak music ith' bowers. Daisies an buttercups smile, Jenny,    Laughingly th' brook flows along;-- An awm havin a smook set oth' stile, Jenny,    But this bacca's uncommonly strong.  Aw wonder if thy heart like mine, Jenny,    Finds its love-burden hard to be borne; Do thi een wi' breet tears ov joy shine, Jenny,    As they glistened an shone yestermorn? Ther's noa treasure wi' thee can compare, Jenny,    Aw'd net change thi for wealth or estate;-- But aw'll goa nah some braikfast to share, Jenny,    For aw can't live baght summat to ait.  Like a nightingale if aw could sing, Jenny,    Aw'd pearch near thy winder at neet, An mi choicest love ditties aw'd bring, Jenny,    An lull thi to rest soft an sweet. Or if th' wand ov a fairy wor mine, Jenny,    Aw'd grant thi whate'er tha could wish;-- But theas porridge are salty as brine, Jenny,    An they'll mak me as dry as a fish.  A garland ov lillies aw'd twine, Jenny,    An place on thy curls golden bright, But aw know 'at they quickly wod pine, Jenny,    I' despair at thy brow's purer white. Them angels 'at fell bi ther pride, Jenny,    Wi' charms like thine nivver wor deckt;-- But yond muck 'at's ith' mistal's to side, Jenny,    Aw mun start on or else aw'st get seckt.  Varry sooin aw shall mak thi mi wife, Jenny,    An awr cot shall a paradise be; Tha shall nivver know trubble or strife, Jenny,    If aw'm able to keep 'em throo thee. If ther's happiness this side oth' grave, Jenny,    Tha shall sewerly come in for thi share;-- An aw'll tell thi what else tha shall have, Jenny,    When aw've a two-or-three moor minnits to spare.    Nooan so Bad.   This world is net a paradise,    Tho' railly aw dooant see, What fowk should growl soa mich abaat;--    Its gooid enuff for me. It's th' only world aw've ivver known,    An them 'at grummel soa, An praich abaat a better land,    Seem varry looath to goa.  Ther's some things 'at awm apt to think,    If aw'd been th' engineer, Aw might ha changed,--but its noa use,--    Aw connot interfere. We're foorced to tak it as it is;    What faults we think we see; It mayn't be what it owt to be,--    But its gooid enuff for me.  Then if we connot alter things,    Its folly to complain; To hunt for faults an failins,    Allus gooas agean my grain. When ther's soa monny pleasant things,    Why should we hunt for pain, If troubles come, we needn't freeat,    For sunshine follows rain.  If th' world gooas cruckt,--what's that to us?    We connot mak it straight; But aw've come to this conclusion,    'At its th' fowk 'at isn't reight. If ivverybody 'ud try to do    Ther best wi' th' means they had, Aw think 'at they'd agree wi' me,--    This world is nooan soa bad.    Th' Honest Hard Worker.   It's hard what poor fowk mun put up wi'!    What insults an snubs they've to tak! What bowin an scrapin's expected,    If a chap's a black coit on his back. As if clooas made a chap ony better,    Or riches improved a man's heart; As if muck in a carriage smell'd sweeter    Nor th' same muck wod smell in a cart.  Give me one, hard workin, an' honest,    Tho' his clooas may be greasy and coorse; If it's muck 'at's been getten bi labor,    It doesn't mak th' man onny worse. Awm sick o' thease simpering dandies,    'At think coss they've getten some brass, They've a reight to luk daan at th' hard workers,    An' curl up their nooas as they pass.  It's a poor sooart o' life to be leadin,    To be curlin an partin ther hair; An seekin one's own fun and pleasure,    Nivver thinkin ha others mun fare. It's all varry weel to be spendin    Ther time at a hunt or a ball, But if th' workers war huntin an doncin,    Whativer wod come on us all?  Ther's summat beside fun an frolic    To live for, aw think, if we try; Th' world owes moor to a honest hard worker    Nor it does to a rich fly-bi-sky. Tho' wealth aw acknowledge is useful,    An' awve oft felt a want on't misen, Yet th' world withaat brass could keep movin,    But it wodn't do long withaat men.  One truth they may put i' ther meersham,    An smoke it--that is if they can; A man may mak hooshuns o' riches,    But riches can ne'er mak a man. Then give me that honest hard worker,    'At labors throo mornin to neet, Tho' his rest may be little an seldom,    Yet th' little he gets he finds sweet.  He may rank wi' his wealthier brother,    An rank heigher, aw fancy, nor some; For a hand 'at's weel hoofed wi' hard labor    Is a passport to th' world 'at's to come. For we know it's a sin to be idle,    As man's days i' this world are but few; Then let's all wi' awr lot be contented,    An continue to toil an to tew.  For ther's one thing we all may be sure on,    If we each do awr best wol we're here; 'At when th' time comes for reckonin, we're called on,    We shall have varry little to fear. An at last, when we throw daan awr tackle,    An are biddin farewell to life's stage, May we hear a voice whisper at partin,    \"Come on, lad! Tha's haddled thi wage.\"    Peevish Poll.   Aw've heeard ov Mary Mischief,    An aw've read ov Natterin Nan; An aw've known a Grumlin Judy,    An a cross-grained Sarah Ann; But wi' all ther faults an failins,    They still seem varry tame, Compared to one aw'll tell yo on,    But aw dursn't tell her name.  Aw'll simply call her Peevish Poll,    That name suits to a dot; But if shoo thowt 'twor meant for her,    Yo bet, aw'st get it hot. Shoo's fat an fair an forty,    An her smile's as sweet as spice, An her voice is low an tender    When shoo's tryin to act nice.  Shoo's lots ov little winnin ways,    'At fit her like a glove; An fowk say shoo's allus pleasant,--    Just a woman they could love. But if they nobbut had her,    They'd find aght for a start, It isn't her wi' th' sweetest smile    At's getten th' kindest heart.  Haivver her poor husband lives    An stands it,--that licks doll! Aw'st ha been hung if aw'd been cursed    Wi' sich a wife as Poll! Her children three, sneak in an aght    As if they wor hawf deead They seem expectin, hawf ther time,    A claat o'th' side o'th' heead.  If they goa aght to laik, shoo storms    Abaat her looanly state; If they stop in, then shoo declares    They're allus in her gate. If they should start to sing or tawk    Shoo tells 'em, \"hold yor din!\" An if they all sit mum, shoo says,    \"It railly is a sin To think ha shoo's to sit an mope,    All th' time at they're away, An when they're hooam they sit like stoops    Withaat a word to say.\"  If feelin cold they creep near th' fire,    They'll varry sooin get floored; Then shoo'll oppen th' door an winder    Declarin shoo's fair smoored. When its soa swelterin an hot    They can hardly get ther breeath, Shoo'll pile on coils an shut all cloise,    An sware shoo's starved to deeath.  Whativver's wrang when they're abaat,    Is their fault for bein thear; An if owt's wrang when they're away,    It's coss they wornt near. To keep 'em all i' misery,    Is th' only joy shoo knows; An then shoo blames her husband,    For bein allus makkin rows.  Poor chap he's wearin fast away,--    He'll leeav us before long; A castiron man wod have noa chonce    Wi' sich a woman's tongue. An then shoo'll freeat and sigh, an try    His virtues to extol; But th' mourner, mooast sincere will be    That chap 'at next weds Poll.    The Old Bachelor's Story.   It was an humble cottage,    Snug in a rustic lane, Geraniums and fuschias peep'd    From every window-pane;  The dark-leaved ivy dressed its walls,    Houseleek adorned the thatch; The door was standing open wide,--    They had no need of latch.  And close besides the corner    There stood an old stone well, Which caught a mimic waterfall,    That warbled as it fell.  The cat, crouched on the well-worn steps,    Was blinking in the sun; The birds sang out a welcome    To the morning just begun.  An air of peace and happiness    Pervaded all the scene; The tall trees formed a back ground    Of rich and varied green;  And all was steeped in quietness,    Save nature's music wild, When all at once, methought I heard    The sobbing of a child.  I listened, and the sound again    Smote clearly on my ear: \"Can there,\"--I wondering asked myself--    \"Can there be sorrow here?\"--  I looked within, and on the floor    Was sat a little boy, Striving to soothe his sister's grief    By giving her a toy.  \"Why weeps your sister thus?\" I asked;    \"What is her cause of grief? Come tell me, little man,\" I said,    \"Come tell me, and be brief.\"  Clasping his sister closer still,    He kissed her tear-stained face, And thus, in homely Yorkshire phrase,    He told their mournful case.               ------  \"Mi mammy, sir, shoos liggin thear,    I' th' shut-up bed i'th' nook; An' tho aw've tried to wakken her,    Shoo'll nawther spaik nor look.
