They knew he was a Genius, because nothing pleased him.  He decided to start with something easy and dash off an Operetta. Having sat through some of the Current Offerings, he noted that the Dialogue was unrelated to Real Literature and the Verses lacked Metrical Symmetry.  It would be a Pipe for a sure-enough Bard to sit down on a Rainy Afternoon and grind out something that might serve as a Model for Harry B. Smith.  So he had a Vase of Fresh Flowers put on his Desk every Day, and he would sit there, waiting for the Muse to keep her Date.  At the end of a Month he had it all planned to lay the First Scene in front of a Palace with a Forest on the Back Drop so as to get a lot of Atmosphere.  There was to be a Princess in the Thing, and a Picture of the long-lost Mother in the Locket and other New Stuff.  He put in Hours and Hours hand-embroidering the Verses.  When he made \"Society\" rhyme with \"Propriety,\" he thought he was getting Gilbertian.  While these Lyrics were still quivering, he would take them out and read them to his wife and the Hired Girl and the man who attended to the Furnace, and get their Impartial Judgement.  They agreed that it was Hot Gravy and too good for the Stage.  Encouraged by these heart-felt Encomiums, he would hike back to the Study, shoot himself in the Arm with a hypothetical Needle, and once more begin picking Grapes in Arcady.  When People came to the House, not knowing that he had been taken down with anything, he would own up that he was working on a Mere Trifle, and then, after being sufficiently urged, he would give a Reading.  These Readings could have been headed off only by an Order of Court or calling out the State Guard.  Inasmuch as the large-size Carnegie Medal for Heroism is waiting for the Caller who has the immortal Rind to tell a poetical Pest that his output is Punk, the Author found himself smeared with Compliments after each of these parlor Try-Outs.  They kidded him into thinking that he had incubated a Whale.  When he had chewed up a Gross of Pencils and taken enough Tea to float the Imperator, the great Work was complete and ready to be launched with a loud Splash.  He began to inquire the Name of some prominent Theatre Blokie who was a keen Student of the Classics and a Person of super-refined Taste. The man he sought had moved into the Poor House, so he compromised by expressing his typewritten Masterpiece to a Ringmaster whose name he had seen on the Three Sheets.  It was marked, \"Valuable Package.\" In a few months the hirelings of the Company and the Driver of the Wagon became well acquainted with the Large Envelope containing the only Hope of the present decadent Period.  Every time the Work came back to him, with a brief printed Suggestion that any Male Adult not physically disabled could make $1.75 a day with a Shovel, the Author would appear at the Afternoon Club with another scathing arraignment of certain Commercial Aspects of the Modern Stage. He saw that it was over their Heads.  It was too darned Dainty for a Flat-Head who spelt Art with a lower- case \"a.\"  Yet it was so drenched and saturated and surcharged with Merit that he resolved to have it done by Local Amateurs rather than see it lost to the World.  The Music was written by Genius No. 2, working in a Piano Store.  He had been writing Great Music for years.  Whenever he heard something catchy, he went home and wrote it.  He was very Temperamental.  That is, he got soused on about three, and, while snooted, would deride Victor Herbert, thus proving that he was Brilliant, though Erratic.  He had a trunkful of Tunes that were too scholarly for the Ikeys who publish Popular Trash.  He fitted them on to the Libretto written by the Litry Guy.  When the two got together to run over the Book and Score, they were sure enthusiastic.  The Author said the Lines were the best he had ever heard, and the Composer said the Numbers were all Gems.  When the Home Talent bunch pulled the whole Affair before a mob of Personal Friends and a subsidized City Editor, it was a Night of Triumph for all concerned.  The trained and trusty Liars who, in every Community, wear Evening Clothes and stand around at Receptions, all crowded up to the Author and gave him the Cordial Mitt and boosted something scandalous. He didn't know that all of them Knocked after they got around the Dutch Lunch.  He went home, sobbing with Joy.  That night he nominated himself for the Hall of Fame and put it to a Vote, and there was not one Dissenting Voice.  Every deluded Boob who can bat up Fungoes in his own Back Yard thinks he is qualified to break into a Major League and line out Two-Baggers.  There was no holding the inspired Librettist and the talented young Composer.  They knew that the eager Public in 48 States was waiting for the Best Thing since \"Robin Hood.\"  The Author went up to the City and found a Manager who had a Desk and a lot of Courage and a varied experience in risking other people's Coin. After the two Geniuses had mortgaged their Homes, the Impresario was enabled to get some Scenery built and rally a large Drove of Artists-- most of them carrying Hand Bags.  During Rehearsals the brutal Stage Manager wanted to cut the Gizzard out of the Book and omit most of the sentimental Arias, but Mr. Words and Mr. Music emitted such shrieks of protest against the threatened Sacrilege that he allowed all the select home-made Guff to remain in the Script.  He thought it would serve them right.  When they gave the first Real Performance in a Dog Town on a drizzly evening in November, there was not Social Eclat to fill the sails.  The House was mostly Paper and therefore very Missouri.  Also a full delegation from the Coffin-Trimmers' Union with Cracked Ice in their Laps.  They did not owe any Money to the Author or have any Kinfolk in the Cast, so they sat back with their Hands under them and allowed the pretty little Opera to die like an Outcast.  The only Laugh in the Piece was when the Drop Curtain refused to work.  After the Show the Manager met them at an Oyster House and told them they had eased a Persimmon to him.  He said the whole Trick was a Bloomer.  It was just as funny as a Wooden Leg.  It needed much Pep and about two tons of Bokum.  Both Words and Music refused to countenance any radical Changes. They said it would be another \"Cavalleria\" as soon as they could do it before an intelligent Audience of True-Lovers.  The Ex-Minstrel Man said there wasn't no such Animal as an intelligent Play-goer.  The Simp that pushed his Metal into the Box Office wanted Something Doing every minute and many Gals, otherwise it was back to the Store- House and a Card in the Clipper.  The Call on the Board read \"Everybody at Ten,\" but the brainy Writer and the versatile Composer were not included.  When they appeared at the Stage Door they were met by Props, who told them to get to a certain Place out of there.  Standing in the Alley, they could hear Wails of Anguish, and they knew that their Child was having the Vital Organs removed.  The celebrated Author of the Graveyard Rag had been summoned in haste. He was in charge of the Clinic--taking out the Grammar and putting in Gags.  The Duos and Ensembles were being dropped through the Trap Door to make way for recent Song Hits from the alcoholic Cabarets.  The Ax fell right on the powdered Neck of the beautiful Prima Donna, who had studied for Grand Opera, but never had been able to find an Orchestra that would fit her Voice.  Her Part was changed from a Princess to a Shop-Lifter and was assigned to Cissy St. Vitus, late of a Burlesque Bunch known as the Lady Bugs. The Tenor was given the Hook, and his sentimental Role was entrusted to a Head-Spinner who had acquired his Dramatic Schooling with the Ringling Circus.  All of which comes under the head of whipping a Performance into Shape.  When the two Geniuses sat out in front they recognized nothing except the Scenery and Costumes.  Their idyllic Creation had been mangled into a roughhouse Riot, in which Disorderly Conduct alternated with the shameless Gyrations taught in San Francisco.  The last Act had been omitted altogether without affecting the coherency of the Story.  The Plot died just four minutes after the Ring-Up.  Although the Report showed 27 Encores and the Gate began to jump $80 a Night, both the intellectual Troubadour and the Student of Counter- Harmonies went to the Manager and cried on his Shoulder and said that their Beautiful work had been ruined.  He called attention to the Chunk of Money tied up in Silk Tights and fireproof Borders.  When it came to a show-down between Dough and Art he didn't propose to tear up his Meal Ticket.  If they would beat it and stay hid and leave the Artists fatten up their Scenes, probably the Bloomer could be converted into a Knock-Out.  While they were in the Sanitarium, the former Minstrel King and young Abie Fixit from the Music Foundry cut out the last vestiges of the Original Stuff and put in two Turns that had landed strong over the whole Orpheum Circuit.  The romantic Operetta now became known as Another One of Those Things.  It was eagerly discussed by Club Women and College Students.  Good seats down in the Observation Rows were not to be had except at the Hotel News Stand.  The Litry Guy and the Music-Maker came out of the Rest Cure to learn that they had registered a Hit and could get their names in \"Who's Who.\"  With the Royalty Checks coming in from the eastern Centers of Culture they were enabled to buy four-cylinder Cars with which to go riding in lonesome Country Lanes, far from the sight of a Bill-Board.  When the Number Two Company came along presenting the Metropolitan Success in the One-Nighters, the reincarnated Gilbert and Sullivan packed up their Families and escaped to French Lick.  It was a Sell-Out, because all the Members of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19813"],["title","Ade's Fables (#8)"],["body","Club wanted to see that new Dido called the Chicken Flop.  There was no knocking at the Dutch Lunches that night.  Every one said the Show was a Bint, but they thought it was up to the Author to resign from the Baptist Church.  MORAL:  In elevating the Drama be sure to get it High enough, even if you have to make it a trifle Gamey.   THE NEW FABLE OF THE WANDERING BOY AND THE WAYWARD PARENT  Once there was a story-book Stripling who uncoupled himself from a Yahoo Settlement and moseyed up to the Congested Crossings and the Electric Signs.  In due time he returned, wearing Gloves and with his Teeth full of Gold.  Ever since that historic Example it has been the daily desire of the Yokel, staked down in a County Seat, to walk in on Judge Gary and form a Partnership.  It befell that after a High School Alumnus had gone to a Varsity and scaled the fearsome heights of Integral and Differential Calculus, he came home to get some more of Father's Shirts and Handkerchiefs and take a new Slant at Life's doubtful Vista, while getting his Board for nothing.  The Town of his Nativity did not occupy many Pages in the statistical Census Reports.  In fact, all the travelling Troupers who had worked for K. and E. referred to it as a Lime, which is the same as a Lemon, only smaller.  The ambitious Bachelor of Arts had a lot of Geological Data and College Fraternity Lore stowed away under his Mortar-Board.  His hopes were set on something more noble than a Chair and a Table and a Blotter in a dusty Office up the Stairway leading to Odd Fellows' Hall.  So he resolved to hit the long Trail leading to a Modern Babylon where the Evening papers were on the Streets before Noon.  He figured that a Gazimbat with a John C. Calhoun Forehead and a lot of inside Dope on Hindoo Anthology could break into almost any Reservoir of Culture and bring home the Bacon.  Parents were dead willing to have him migrate and take his Tailor Bills with him, but they shivered with Dread when it came time to ship him to Gomorrah.  They knew all about the unbridled Deviltry of the City, having seen the large colored Illustrations in the Sunday Papers.  They had it on good Authority that the whole sub-stratum of Urban Existence was honeycombed with Rathskellers, while a Prominent Actress waited on almost every Corner, soliciting Travel on the Taxicab Route to the everlasting Coke Ovens.  While Elmer's fragile Steamer Trunk was being hoisted into the Dray, all the Relations who had assisted in bringing him up by Hand clustered around the melodeon and sang, \"Oh, where is my Boy to-night?\"  After the Day Coach had pulled away from the Depot, he opened the Shoe- Box to extract a Crull and found a Book written by T. DeWitt Talmage, in which many Passages were marked.  He arrived at Union Station with his Fingers crossed.  He told himself that he would break into a Dog Trot every time Vice beckoned to him. After he had hung up his Diploma and Razor Strop in the third-story Recess of a very naughty Beanery, he hunted up some of the dear old Pals with whom he had bunked in the Dorm.  They told him they would put him next to a lot of nice clean People. He began to tremble, fearing that some one was about to offer him Champagne, but the Orgy to which they conducted him was merely a meeting of the Civic Purifiers in a basement underneath a Church. He had not expected to find any Churches in the great wicked City.  He thought each side of the Street would be built up solidly with Syndicate Theatres, Bacchanalian Bazaars, and Manicure Pitfalls.  Instead of finding Vice triumphant, he learned that it was being chased up an Alley by the entire Police Force and the Federation of Women's Clubs.  He had the gift of Gab and a natural thirst for Tea, and the first thing he knew he had been drawn into so many Campaigns for Social Betterment that he had no time to hunt up conventional Temptations, such as the Welsh Rabbit or the Musical Comedy.  He found himself sitting next to a new type of Lassie.  She had no Heels on her Shoes, pronounced each Syllable distinctly, and believed that her Mission in Life was to carry Maeterlinck to the Masses.  In nearly every Instance she had a Father who acted as frozen Figurehead for some Trust Company.  Consequently, Elmer began to perk up and serve on Committees which met in Exclusive Homes and were entirely surrounded by Mahogany.  Whenever an Intellectual Queen pushed the Button, Elmer was right there with a Pitcher of Ice Water.  His Researches had proved to him that one of the Keenest Enjoyments of City Life is to remain away from the glaring Lobster Palace, especially when one can get one's Mallard Duck free of charge in a Flat renting for $6000 a Year.  Elmer became identified with the Cleaning Brigade of the Reform Element simply by riding on the Current of Events.  Adapting himself unconsciously to his antisepticized Environment, he acquired the Art of putting over the saccharine Extemporaneous Address, and he could smile, with his Teeth exposed, for an Hour at a time. In fact, he was a great Success.  At first he took in the Symphony Orchestra because he was dragged thither.  After about two years the Virus had permeated his System, and he was a regular Brahmsite.  If he didn't get a full dose of Peer Gynt every few days, he was as nervous as a Cat.  The tall and straight-grained Heiress who finally landed him was only too glad to slip him the Bank-Book and tell him to go and sit in with the other Directors.  And now, having become a shiny Pillar in the Presbyterian Temple and one of the most respected Umbrella-Carriers on the Avenue, he felt a longing to beat it back to the home Burg and exhibit his Virtues to the members of the I-Knew-Him-When Club.  He wanted to patronize the Friends of his Youth and note the Expressions of Discomfiture on the so-called Faces of Aunt Lib and Uncle Jethro, both of whom had told around that he was a Gnat (Net) and never would amount to a Hill of Beans.  Elmer expected to find the same spotted Dog asleep in front of the Commercial Hotel and the same Stick Candy exhibited in the Show Windows.  But, while he had been witnessing the downfall of Evil in the busy Metropolis, the Home Town had been putting on a little Side-Show of its own.  Along at the gateway of the 20th Century, every undersized Hamlet shown in the Atlas became seized with a Desire to throw on City Lugs.  The same Father who had marked the Talmage Book for Elmer became Chairman of the House Committee in a Club which undertook to serve anything usually found on either side of a Cash Register.  Being in the heart of the Residence District, this select Organization could not obtain a regular License.  However, having the moral support of the Best People, it maintained a Blind Pig.  The combination of Blind Pig, two playful Kitties up-stairs, and a lot of gay Dogs spread out on the upholstered Chairs, certainly proved to be some Menagerie.  It was a matter of Pride with the Members that the Colored Boy could shake up anything known to the Regular Trade at the Knickerbocker or the Plaza.  One of their main Delights, also, was to welcome the Stranger, who thought he was sojourning among the Rubes, and lead him into the Roodle Department, the purpose being to get him out on a Limb and then saw off the Limb.  Poker was written in a Small Town.  The Hay-Mow Graduate with a limited Income, who counts up every Night and sets aside so much for Wheat Cakes, can hold them closer to his Bosom and play them tighter than any Shark that ever floated down the Mississippi.  The newcomer who tried to be Liberal usually went home in his Stocking Feet.  Day by Day the Progressive Element in the Community widened its Horizon, and the Country Club became a Necessity.  The 9-hole Course was laid out by a Scotch Professional, and every Locker contained something besides Clubs.  When the Church Bells were ding-donging at 10 A. M. on Sunday, the former teacher of the Bible Class and the back-sliding Basso of the Choir would be zig-zagging around the Links, the Stake being a Ball a Hole.  Elmer's Father became a Demon with the Irons and had his Name engraved on a Consolation Cup.  Simultaneous with the Golf Epidemic, a good many Families that could not afford Kitchen Cabinets began to glide around in red Touring-Cars. Any one smelling the Blue Smoke along Main Street and then looking both ways before dashing across to the Drug Store was compelled to admit that the Jays had awakened from their Long Sleep.  Refined Vawdyville was on tap daily, and the Children of those who were only moderately well-to-do knew all the latest improper Songs.  While the men were changing from Jumpers to Tuxedos, the Sisters had not remained stationary.  The Lap Supper was formally abolished soon after Puff Sleeves went out. Girls who had been brought up on Parchesi and Muggins would sit around the Bridge Table all afternoon, trying to cop out some Lace for the new Party Dress.  An imported Professor taught the Buds how to Tango and Trot.  Within a week after a new one had horrified Newport, the Younger Set would have it down pat and be mopping up the floor with one another. Of course they were denounced by the local Ministers, but the Guilty Parties never heard the Denunciations, as they were out Motoring at the time.  Whenever there was a Big Session, all Bridles were removed and the Speed Limit abolished.  Riding home in the Livery Hacks about 4 A. M., the Merry-Makers would be all in, but much gratified to know that Vienna and Paree had nothing on them as regards Rough House.  All the Elite would get together and open a Keg of Spikes at the slightest Provocation.  It was remarkable how much Dull Care they could banish in one Evening, especially if they got an Early Start.  The Town Pump did a punk Business, but the Side-Boards blossomed with Fusel Oil and Fizzerine.  Intense Excitement prevailed when word came that Elmer was En Route. Little Knots of People could be seen"]]]
