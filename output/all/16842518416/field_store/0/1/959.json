Two things must be kept in mind if we are to understand the       system fully. In the first place, in the division of the lands       among the barons of the conquering nation, no account was taken       of the peasants. As they were of the defeated people, their       rights to the land were not once considered. In many countries,       the victors thought of them as part and parcel of the conquered       territory. They “went with” the land and were considered by the       lord of the county as merely his servants. When one lord turned       over a farm to another, the farmers were part of the bargain. If       any of them tried to run away, they were brought back and       whipped. They tilled the land and raised live stock, giving a       certain share of their yearly crop and a certain number of       beeves, hogs, sheep, etc., to the lord, as rent for the land,       much as the free farmers in other countries paid tribute to the       robber chieftains. Thus the one class of people who really earned       their right to live, by producing wealth, were oppressed and       robbed by all the others. Note this point, for there are wrongs       existing today that are due to the fact that the feudal system is       not wholly stamped out in some countries.  [Illustration: A Vassal doing Homage to his Lord]        In the second place, it must be noted that the king was not the       direct master of all the people. Only the great lords had sworn       homage to him. He was lord of the dukes, earls, and barons. The       less important barons swore homage to the great barons, and the       knights, squires, retainers, and yeomen swore homage to the       lesser barons. If a lesser baron had subdivided his fief among       certain knights and squires, the peasants owed allegiance, not to       him, but to the squire to whom they had been assigned. Thus, if a       “man” rebelled against his lord, all of his knights, retainers,       etc., must rebel also. If, for instance, a great duke refused to       obey his king and broke his oath of allegiance, all his little       barons and knights must turn disloyal too, or rather, must remain       loyal, for their oaths had been taken to support the duke, and       not the king. History is full of such cases. In many instances,       dukes became so powerful that they were able to make war on even       terms with kings. The great Dukes of Burgundy for a time kept the       kings of France in awe of their power; the Duke of Northumberland       in 1403 raised an army that almost overthrew King Henry Fourth of       England; the Duke of York, in 1461, drove Henry Sixth from the       throne of England and became king in his place.  [Illustration: William the Conqueror]        A strange case arose when, in 1066, William, who as duke of       Normandy had sworn homage to the king of France, became, through       conquest, king of England. His sons, great-grandsons, and       great-great-grandsons continued for one hundred and fifty years       to be obliged to swear allegiance to the French kings in order to       keep the duchy of Normandy. It was as if the Governor of Texas       had led an army into Mexico, conquered it, and become Emperor of       that country, without resigning his governorship or giving up his       American citizenship.        Two things which tended to break down the feudal system and bring       more power to the common people were, first, the invention of       gunpowder, and, second, the rise of towns. A man with a musket       could bring down a knight in armor as easily as he could the most       poorly armored peasant. Kings, in fighting to control their great       lords, gave more freedom to citizens of towns in return for their       help. The king’s armies came to be recruited largely from       townspeople, who were made correspondingly free from the feudal       lords.        The rule of the feudal system, that each man owed a certain       amount of military service to his ruler has lasted to the present       day and is responsible for much of the misery that now exists.       Kings went to war with each other simply to increase their       territories. The more land a king had under his control, the more       people who owed him taxes, and the greater number he could get       into his army, the greater became his ambition to spread his       kingdom still farther.           Questions for Review             How was it that the king of a tribe could claim to own all           the land in the country which he had invaded?            Did the kings, lords, and fighting men contribute anything to           the welfare of the working classes?            Would the peasants have been better off if all the fighting           men, lords, dukes, kings, etc., had suddenly been killed?            Can you see why in some countries in Europe a man who earns           his living is looked down upon by the nobles?            What is meant by saying that the feudal system turns society           upside down?            Why did the farmers continue to feed the fighting men?            Explain how the use of gunpowder in warfare helped to break           up the feudal system.            How did the rise of cities also help to do away with the           feudal system?     Chapter V. A Babel of Tongues        The great family of languages.—Few languages in Europe not       belonging to the family.—The dying Celtic languages.—The three       branches of the Germanic family.—The influence of the Latin       tongue on the south of Europe.—The many Slavic peoples.—The map       as divided by kings without regard to peoples and languages.—The       strange mixture in Austria-Hungary.—The southeast of Europe.—The       Greeks and Dacians.—The Roman colonists.—The Slavs.—The       Volgars.—The Skipetars.—A hopeless mixture.         In Chapter II it was pointed out that almost all the peoples of       Europe were related, in one big family of tribes. It is likely       that the forefathers of the Celts, the Latins, the Germans, the       Greeks, and the Slavs belonged to one big tribe which had its       home back in the highlands of Central Asia. As a general rule,       the relationship of peoples to each other can be told by the       languages which they speak. If two tribes are related because       their forefathers once belonged to the same tribe, it is almost       certain that they will show this relationship in their languages.        The language of England a thousand years ago was very much like       the language of the Germans, for the English were originally       German tribes. Even today, it is easy to see that English is a       Germanic language. Take the English words house, father, mother,       brother, water, here, is, etc. The German words which mean the       same are _haus, vater, mutter, bruder, wasser, hier, ist_. It is       very plain that the two languages must have come from the same       source.        There are professors in European colleges who have spent their       whole lives studying this relationship of languages. These men       have proved not only that almost all the languages of Europe are       related, but that the language of the Persians, and that of some       of the old tribes in Hindustan also belong to one great family of       tongues. Let us take the word for mother. In one of the ancient       languages of Hindustan it was _matr_; in the Greek, it was       _mātār_; in the Latin _mater_ (mätār); in the Bohemian       _matka_; in the German _mu̠tter_; in the Spanish mädre; in the       Norwegian _mōder_, etc. This great family of languages is called       “the Indo-European group,” because the tribes which spoke them,       originally inhabitants of Asia, have scattered all over India and       Europe. The only peoples in Europe whose languages do not belong       to it are the Finns and Laplanders of the north, the Basques       (Bȧsks) of the Pyrenees Mountains, the Hungarians, the Gypsies,       and the Turks.        The descendants of the old Celtic peoples have not kept up the       Celtic languages to any great extent. The reason for this is that       first the Romans and then the Germanic tribes conquered most of       the lands where the Celts lived. In this way, Spain, Portugal,       France, and Belgium now talk languages that have grown from the       Latin, the language of Rome. The Celts in the British Isles now       all talk English, because the English, who were a Germanic       people, conquered them and forced them to use their language.       Patriotic Irishmen and Welshmen (who are descendants of the       Celtic tribes) are trying to keep alive the Irish and Welsh       languages, but all of the young people in the British Isles learn       English, and they are generally content to talk only one       language. The other Celtic languages which have existed within       the last one hundred years are the Gaelic of the north of       Scotland, the Breton of western France, and the Cornish of the       southwestern corner of England.        The Germanic languages (sometimes called Teutonic) are found in       three parts of Europe today. The Scandinavian languages, Danish,       Norwegian, and Swedish, belong to this family. Western Austria       and Germany form, with Holland and Western Belgium, a second       group of German-speaking nations. (The people of eastern Belgium       are Celts and talk a kind of French.) The third part of Europe       which uses a Germanic language is England.        In an earlier chapter we learned how the Celts in France, Spain,       and Portugal gave up their own languages and used the Latin."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11200"],["title","The World War and What was Behind It; Or, The Story of the Map of Europe (#7)"],["body","languages today are found also in the southern and western       parts of Switzerland, all over Italy, and in Roumania.        We learned also about the Slavs who lived to the eastward of the       Germanic tribes. When the Germans moved west, these Slavs       followed them and occupied the lands which had just been left       vacant. In this way, we find Slavic peoples talking Slavic       (sometimes called Slavonic) languages in the parts of Europe to       the east and south of the Germans. More than half of the       inhabitants of Austria-Hungary are Slavs, although the Austrians       proper are a Germanic people, and the Hungarians do not belong to       the Indo-European family at all. The Serbians and Montenegrins       are Slavs. The Poles and Russians are Slavs. The Bulgarians speak       a Slavic language and have some Slavic blood in them, although,       as will be pointed out later, originally they did not belong to       the Slavic family.  [Illustration: Map: Distribution Of Peoples According to Relationship]        The Greeks and Albanians belong to the great Indo-European family       of tribes, but their languages are not closely related to any of       the four great branches.  [Illustration: Distribution Of Languages]        The two maps on pages 65 and 66 are very much alike and yet in       some respects very different. The first shows how Europe is       largely inhabited by peoples of the great Indo-European family.       Those who are descended from the Celts are marked Celtic even       though today they have given up their Celtic language, as have       the Cornish in England and the inhabitants of Spain, France,       eastern Belgium, and the greater part of Ireland. The Bulgarians       are marked as not belonging to the great family, although they       speak a Slavic language.        In the second map, the distribution of languages is shown. You       will notice that the Celtic languages are found only in small       parts of the British Isles, and in the westernmost point of       France. The Bulgarians are here marked Slavic because their       language belongs to that branch. One of the most curious things       about the two maps is the presence of little spots like islands,       particularly made up of German-speaking peoples. There are       several of these little islands in Russia. They have been there       for nearly two hundred years. A traveler crossing the southern       part of Russia is astonished to find districts as large as an       American county where not a word of Russian is spoken. The people       are all of Germanic blood, although they live under the       government of Russia. In the same way, there is a large German       island in the midst of the Roumanians in Transylvania and another       between the Slovaks and Poles at the foot of the Carpathian       Mountains. There is a large Hungarian island in Transylvania       also, entirely surrounded by Germans and Roumanians. The table on       the opposite page shows the main branches of the Indo-European       family that are found in Europe.           The Indo-European Family of Languages            (_a_) Hindu branch            (_b_) Persian branch            (_c_) Celtic branch           Gāe′lic (northern Scotland) Welsh Cornish (dead)           Erse (Irish) Brē′ton (western France)            (_d_) Latin branch           Portuguese Spanish French Romansh (southeastern Switzerland)           Italian Roumanian            (_e_) Germanic branch           Norwegian Danish Swedish Dutch Flemish (Belgium)           Low German High German English            (_f_) Slavonic branch           Russian Polish Lettish Lithuanian Old Prussian (dead) Czech           (Bohemian [pronounced Chĕck]) Slō vak′ (northern Hungary)           Serbian Bulgarian Slove′nian (southwestern Austria)           Crōa′tian (southern Austria)           Ruthē′nian (northeastern Austria-Hungary, and southwestern           Russia)   } } Baltic states of Russia }            (_g_) Greek            (_h_) Albā′nian        The main source of the present trouble in Europe is that kings       and their ministers and generals, like their ancestors, the       feudal lords, never considered the wishes of the people when they       changed the boundaries of kingdoms. Austria-Hungary is a good       example. The Austrians and Hungarians were two very different       peoples. They had nothing in common and did not wish to be joined       under one ruler, but a king of Hungary, dying, left no son to       succeed him, and his only daughter was married to the archduke of       Austria. This archduke of Austria (a descendant of the counts of       Hapsburg) was also emperor of Germany and king of Bohemia,       although the Bohemian people had not chosen him as their ruler.       The Hungarians, before their union with Austria, had conquered       certain Slavic tribes and part of the Roumanians. Later Austria       annexed part of Poland. In this way, the empire became a jumble       of languages and nationalities. When its congress is called       together, the official announcement is read in eleven different       languages. Forty-one different dialects are talked in an area not       as large as that of the state of Texas.        We must remember that besides the literary or written languages       of each country there are several spoken dialects. A man from       Devonshire, England, meeting a man from Yorkshire in the north of       the same country, has difficulty in understanding many words in       his speech. The language of the south of Scotland also is       English, although it is very different from the English that we       in America are taught. A Frenchman from the Pyrenees Mountains       was taught in school to speak and read the French language as we       find it in books. Yet besides this, he knows a dialect that is       talked by the country people around him, that can not be       understood by the peasants from the north of France near the       Flemish border. The man who lives in the east of France can       understand the dialect of the Italians from the west of Italy       much better than he can that of the Frenchman from the Atlantic       coast.        In America, with people moving around from place to place by       means of stage coach, steamboat, and railroad, there has been no       great chance to develop dialects, although we can instantly tell       the New Englander, the southerner, or the westerner by his       speech. It should be remembered that in Europe, for centuries,       the people were kept on their own farms or in their own towns.       The result of this was that each little village or city has its       own peculiar language. It is said that persons who have studied       such language matters carefully, after conversing with a man from       Europe, can tell within thirty miles where his home used to be in       the old country. There are no sharply marked boundaries of       languages. The dialects of France shade off into those of Spain       on the one hand and into those of the Flemish and the Italian on       the other.  [Illustration: Southeastern Europe, 600 B.C.]        The British Isles furnish us with four or five different       nationalities. The people of the north of Ireland are really       lowland Scotch of Germanic descent, while the other three-fourths       of Ireland is inhabited by Celts. To make the difference all the       greater, the Celts are almost universally Catholics, while the       Scotch-Irish are Protestants. The people of the north of Scotland       are Gaels, a Celtic race having no connection in language or       blood with the people of the southern half of that country. The       Welsh are a Celtic people, having no relationship with the       English, who are a Germanic people. The Welsh and the Cornish of       Cornwall and the people of highland Scotland are the descendants       of the ancient Britons and Gaels who inhabited the island when       Julius Caesar and the Romans first landed there. Then five       hundred years afterwards, as has already been told, came great       swarms of Germans (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes), who drove the       Britons to the west and north, and settled the country now known       as England. After these, you will recall, came a number of Danes,       another Germanic people, who settled the east coast of England.       Two hundred years later, the Normans came from France. These       Normans had been living in France for a century or two, but had       come originally from Norway. Normans, Danes, Angles, and Saxons       all mixed to make the modern English. Together, they fought the       Scotch, the Welsh and the Irish, and having conquered them,       oppressed them harshly for many centuries.  [Illustration: Southeastern Europe, 975 A.D.]        But it is in the southeastern corner of Europe that one finds the       worst jumble of nationalities. Six hundred years before Christ,       the Greeks and their rougher cousins, the Thracians, Macedonians,       and Dacians inhabited this district. When one of the Roman       Emperors conquered the Dacians about 100 A.D., he planted a large       Roman colony north of the Danube River. Then came the West Goths,       who swept into this country, but soon left it for the west of       Europe. Next came the Slavic tribes who are the ancestors of the       modern Serbs. Following these, came a large tribe which did not       belong to the Indo-European family, but was distantly related to       the Finns and the Turks. These people were called the Volgars,       for they came from the country around the River Volga. Before       long, we find them called the Bulgars. (The letters B and V are       often interchanged in the languages of south-eastern Europe. The       people of western Europe used to call the country of the Serbs       Servia, but the Serbs"]]]
