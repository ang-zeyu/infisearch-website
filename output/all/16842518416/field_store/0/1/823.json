That afternoon under my window there was a tall wagon, a sort of hay wagon, in which there were twenty-two little tow-headed children, none more than eight or ten and several almost babies in arms.  By the side of the wagon a man, evidently father of some of them, stood buttering the end of a huge round loaf of bread and cutting off slice after slice, which the older children broke and distributed to the little ones.  Two cows were tied to the back of the wagon and the man's wife squatted there milking them. All along the quay and in the streets leading into it were people like this--harmless, helpless, hard-working people, going they knew not where.  The entrance to the bridge was soon choked.  One went away and returned an hour later and found the same people waiting almost in the same spot, and, with that wonderful calm and patience of theirs, feeding their children or giving a little of their precious hay to the horses, quietly waiting their turn while the cannon which had driven them from their homes kept on thundering behind them.  That afternoon I walked up-town through the shuttered, silent streets-- silent but for that incessant rumbling in the southeast and the occasional honking flight of some military automobile--to two of the hospitals.  In one, a British hospital on the Boulevard Leopold, the doctor in charge was absent for the moment, and there was no one to answer my offer of occasional help if an outsider could be of use.  As I sat waiting a tall, brisk Englishwoman, in nurse's uniform, came up and asked what I wanted.  I told her.  \"Oh,\" she said, and in her crisp, English voice, without further ado, \"will you help me with a leg?\"  She led the way into her ward, and there we contrived between us to bandage and slip a board and pillow under a fractured thigh.  Between whispers of \"Courage! Courage!\" to the Belgian soldier, she said that she was the wife of a British general and had two sons in the army, and a third--\"Poor boy!\" she murmured, more to him than to me--on one of the ships in the North Sea.  I arranged to come back next morning to help with the lifting, and went on to another hospital in the Rue Nerviens, to find that little English lady who crossed with me in the Ostend boat in August on the way to her sister's hospital in Antwerp.  Here in the quiet wards she had been working while the Germans swept down on Paris and were rolled back again, and while the little nation which she and her sister loved so well was being clubbed to its knees.  Louvain, Liege, Malines, Namur--chapters in all the long, pitiless story were lying there in the narrow iron beds.  There were men with faces chewed by shrapnel, men burned in the explosion of the powder magazine at Fort Waelhem, when the attack on Antwerp began--dragged out from the underground passage in which the garrison had sought momentary refuge and where most of them were killed, burned, and blackened.  One strong, good-looking young fellow, able to eat and live apparently, was shot through the temples and blind in both eyes.  It was the hour for carrying those well enough to stand it out into the court and giving them their afternoon's airing and smoke.  One had lost an arm, another, a whimsical young Belgian, had only the stump of a left leg. When we started to lift him back into his bed, he said he had a better way than that.  So he put his arms round my neck and showed me how to take him by the back and the well leg.  \"Bon!\" he said, and again \"Bon!\" when I let him down, and then, reaching out and patting me on the back, \"Bon!\" he smiled again.  That night, behind drawn curtains which admitted no light to the street, we dined peacefully and well, and, except for this unwonted seclusion, just outside which were the black streets and still the endless procession of carts and wagons and shivering people, one might have forgotten, in that cheerfully lighted room, that we were not in times of peace.  We even loitered over a grate fire before going to bed, and talked in drowsy and almost indifferent fashion of whether it was absolutely sure that the Germans were trying to take the town.  It was almost exactly midnight that I found myself listening, half awake, to the familiar sound of distant cannon.  One had come to think of it, almost, as nothing but a sound; and to listen with a detached and not unpleasant interest as a man tucked comfortably in bed follows a roll of thunder to its end or listens to the fall of rain.  It struck me suddenly that there was something new about this sound; I sat up in bed to listen, and at that instant a far-off, sullen \"Boom !\" was followed by a crash as if lightning had struck a house a little way down the street.  As I hurried to the window there came another far-off detonation, a curious wailing whistle swept across the sky, and over behind the roofs to the left there was another crash.  One after another they came, at intervals of half a minute, or screaming on each other's heels as if racing to their goal.  And then the crash or, if farther away, muffled explosion as another roof toppled in or cornice dropped off, as a house made of canvas drops to pieces in a play.  The effect of those unearthly wails, suddenly singing in across country in the dead of night from six--eight--ten miles away--Heaven knows where--was, as the Germans intended it to be, tremendous.  It is not easy to describe nor to be imagined by those who had not lived in that threatened city--the last Belgian stronghold--and felt that vast, unseen power rolling nearer and nearer.  And now, all at once, it was here, materialized, demoniacal, a flying death, swooping across the dark into your very room.  It was like one of those dreams in which you cannot stir from your tracks, and meanwhile \"Boom...  Tzee-ee-ee-ee !\"--is this one meant for you?  Already there was a patter of feet in the dark, and people with white bundles on their backs went stumbling by toward the river and the bridge.  Motors came honking down from the inner streets, and the quay, which had begun to clear by this time, was again jammed.  I threw on some clothes, hurried to the street.  A rank smell of kerosene hung in the air; presently a petrol shell burst to the southward, lighting up the sky for an instant like the flare from a blast-furnace, and a few moments later there showed over the roofs the flames of the first fire.  Although we could hear the wail of shells flying across their wide parabola both into the town and out from the first ring of forts, few burst in our part of the city that night, and we walked up as far as the cathedral without seeing anything but black and silent streets.  Every one in the hotel was up and dressed by this time.  Some were for leaving at once; one family, piloted by the comfortable Belgian servants--far cooler than any one else--went to the cellar, some gathered about the grate in the writing-room to watch the night out; the rest of us went back to bed.  There wasn't much sleep for any one that night.  The bombardment kept on until morning, lulled slightly, as if the enemy might be taking breakfast, then it continued into the, next day.  And now the city--a busy city of nearly four hundred thousand people--emptied itself in earnest. Citizens and soldiers, field-guns, motor-trucks, wheelbarrows, dog-carts, hay-ricks, baby-carriages, droves of people on foot, all flowing down to the Scheldt, the ferries, and the bridge.  They poured into coal barges, filling the yawning black holes as Africans used to fill slave-ships, into launches and tugs, and along the roads leading down the river and southwestward toward Ostend.  One thought with a shudder of what would happen if the Germans dropped a few of their shells into that helpless mob, and it is only fair to remember that they did not, although retreating Belgian soldiers were a part of it, and one of the German aeroplanes, a mere speck against the blue, was looking calmly down overhead.  Nor did they touch the cathedral, and their agreement not to shell any of the buildings previously pointed out on a map delivered to them through the American Legation seemed to be observed.  Down through that mass of fugitives pushed a London motor-bus ambulance with several wounded British soldiers, one of them sitting upright, supporting with his right hand a left arm, the biceps, bound in a blood-soaked tourniquet, half torn away.  They had come in from the trenches, where their comrades were now waiting, with their helpless little rifles, for an enemy, miles away, who lay back at his ease and pounded them with his big guns.  I asked them how things were going, and they said not very well.  They could only wait until the German aeroplanes had given the range and the trenches became too hot, then fall back, dig themselves in, and play the same game over again.  Following them was a hospital-service motor-car, driven by a Belgian soldier and in charge of a young British officer.  It was his present duty to motor from trench to trench across the zone of fire, with the London bus trailing behind, and pick up wounded.  It wasn't a particularly pleasant job, he said, jerking his head toward the distant firing, and frankly he wasn't keen about it.  We talked for some time, every one talked to every one else in Antwerp that morning, and when he started out again I asked him to give me a lift to the edge of town.  Quickly we raced through the Place de Meir and the deserted streets of the politer part of Antwerp, where, the night before, most of the shells had fallen.  We went crackling over broken glass, past gaping cornices and holes in the pavement, five feet across and three feet deep, and once passed a house quietly burning away with none to so much as watch the fire.  The city wall, along which are the first line of forts, drew near, then the tunnel passing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11008"],["title","Antwerp to Gallipoli: A Year of the War on Many Fronts—and Behind Them (#7)"],["body"," it, and we went through without pausing and on down the road to Malines.  We were beyond the town now, bowling rapidly out into the flat Belgian country, and, clinging there to the running-board with the October wind blowing quite through a thin flannel suit, it suddenly came over me that things had moved very fast in the last five minutes, and that all at once, in some unexpected fashion, all that elaborate barrier of laissez-passers, sauf-conduits, and so on, had been swept aside, and, quite as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world, I was spinning out to that almost mythical \"front.\"  Front, indeed! It was two fronts.  There was an explosion just behind us, a hideous noise overhead, as if the whole zenith had somehow been ripped across like a tightly stretched piece of silk, and a shell from the Belgian fort under which we had just passed went hurtling down long aisles of air--farther--farther--to end in a faint detonation miles away.  Out of sight in front of us, there was an answering thud, and-- \"Tzee-ee-ee-er-r-r-ong!\"--a German shell had gone over us and burst behind the Belgian fort.  Under this gigantic antiphony the motor-car raced along, curiously small and irrelevant on that empty country road.  We passed great holes freshly made, neatly blown out of the macadam, then a dead horse.  There were plenty of dead horses along the roads in France, but they had been so for days.  This one's blood was not yet dry, and the shell that had torn the great rip in its chest must have struck here this morning.  We turned into the avenue of trees leading up to an empty chateau, a field-hospital until a few hours before.  Mattresses and bandages littered the deserted room, and an electric chandelier was still burning.  The young officer pointed to some trenches in the garden.  \"I had those dug to put the wounded in in case we had to hold the place,\" he said.  \"It was getting pretty hot.\"  There was nothing here now, however, and, followed by the London bus with its obedient enlisted men doing duty as ambulance orderlies, we motored a mile or so farther on to the nearest trench.  It was in an orchard beside a brick farmhouse with a vista in front of barbed-wire entanglement and a carefully cleaned firing field stretching out to a village and trees about half a mile away.  They had looked very interesting and difficult, those barbed-wire mazes and suburbs, ruthlessly swept of trees and houses, when I had seen the Belgians preparing for the siege six weeks before, and they were to be of about as much practical use now as pictures on a wall.  There are, it will be recalled, three lines of forts about Antwerp--the inner one, corresponding to the city's wall; a middle one a few miles farther out, where the British now were; and the outer line, which the enemy had already passed.  Their artillery was hidden far over behind the horizon trees, and the British marines and naval-reserve men who manned these trenches could only wait there, rifle in hand, for an enemy that would not come, while a captive balloon a mile or two away to the eastward and an aeroplane sailing far overhead gave the ranges, and they waited for the shrapnel to burst. The trenches were hasty affairs, narrow and shoulder-deep, very like trenches for gas or water pipes, and reasonably safe except when a shell burst directly overhead.  One had struck that morning just on the inner rim of the trench, blown out one of those crater-like holes, and discharged all its shrapnel backward across the trench and into one of the heavy timbers supporting a bombproof roof.  A raincoat hanging to a nail in this timber was literally shot to shreds. \"That's where I was standing,\" said the young lieutenant in command, pointing with a dry smile to a spot not more than a yard from where the shell had burst.  Half a dozen young fellows, crouched there in the bomb-proof, looked out at us and grinned.  They were brand-new soldiers, some of them, boys from the London streets who had answered the thrilling posters and signs, \"Your King and Country Need You,\" and been sent on this ill-fated expedition for their first sight of war.  The London papers are talking about it as I am writing this--how this handful of nine thousand men, part of them recruits who scarcely knew one end of a rifle from another, were flung across the Channel on Sunday night and rushed up to the front to be shot at and rushed back again.  I did not know this then, but wondered if this was what they had dreamed of--squatting helplessly in a ditch until another order came to retire--when they swung through the London streets singing \"It's a long, long way to Tipperary\" two months before.  Yet not one of the youngest and the greenest showed the least nervousness as they waited there in that melancholy little orchard under the incessant scream of shells.  That unshakable British coolness, part sheer pluck, part a sort of lack of imagination, perhaps, or at least of \"nerves,\" left them as calm and casual as if they were but drilling on the turf of Hyde Park.  And with it persisted that almost equally unshakable sense of class, that touching confidence in one's superiors-- the young clerk's or mechanic's inborn conviction that whatever that smart, clean-cut, imperturbable young officer does and says must inevitably be right--at least, that if he is cool and serene you must, if the skies fall, be cool and serene too.  We met one young fellow as we walked through an empty lateral leading to a bomb-proof prepared for wounded, and the ambulance officer asked him sharply how things had been going that morning.  \"Oh, very well, sir,\" he said with the most respectful good humor, though a shell bursting just then a stone's throw beyond the orchard made both of us duck our heads.  \"A bit hot, sir, about nine o'clock, but only one man hurt.  They do seem to know just where we are, sir; but wait till their infantry comes up--we'll clean them out right enough, sir.\"  And, if he had been ordered to stay there and hold the trench alone, one could imagine him saying, in that same tone of deference and chipper good humor, \"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" and staying, too, till the cows came home.  We motored down the line to another trench--this one along a road with fields in front and, about a couple of hundred yards behind, a clump of trees which masked a Belgian battery.  The officer here, a tall, upstanding, gravely handsome young man, with a deep, strong, slightly humorous voice, and the air of one both born to and used to command--the best type of navy man--came over to meet us, rather glad, it seemed, to see some one.  The ambulance officer had just started to speak when there was a roar from the clump of trees, at the same instant an explosion directly overhead, and an ugly chunk of iron--a bit of broken casing from a shrapnel shell--plunged at our very feet.  The shell had been wrongly timed and exploded prematurely.  \"I say!\" the lieutenant called out to a Belgian officer standing not far away, \"can't you telephone over to your people to stop that? That's the third time we've been nearly hit by their shrapnel this morning.  After all\"--he turned to us with the air of apologizing somewhat for his display of irritation--\"it's quite annoying enough here without that, you know.\"  It was, indeed, annoying--very.  The trenches were not under fire in the sense that the enemy were making a persistent effort to clear them out, but they were in the zone of fire, their range was known, and there was no telling, when that distant boom thudded across the fields, whether that particular shell might be intended for them or for somebody's house in town.  We could see in the distance their captive balloon, and there were a couple of scouts, the officer said, in a tower in the village, not much more than half a mile away.  He pointed to the spot across the barbed wire. \"We've been trying to get them for the last half-hour.\"  We left them engaged in this interesting distraction, the little rifle-snaps in all that mighty thundering seeming only to accent the loneliness and helplessness of their position, and spun on down the transverse road, toward another trench.  The progress of the motor seemed slow and disappointing.  Not that the spot a quarter of a mile off was at all less likely to be hit, yet one felt conscious of a growing desire to be somewhere else.  And, though I took off my hat to keep it from blowing off, I found that every time a shell went over I promptly put it on again, indicating, one suspected, a decline in what the military experts call morale.  As we bowled down the road toward a group of brick houses on the left, a shell passed not more than fifty yards in front of us and through the side of one of these houses as easily as a circus rider pops through a tissue-paper hoop.  Almost at the same instant another exploded--where, I haven't the least idea, except that the dust from it hit us in the face. The motor rolled smoothly along meanwhile, and the Belgian soldier driving it stared as imperturbably ahead of him as if he were back at Antwerp on the seat of his taxicab.  You get used to shells in time, it seems, and, deciding that you either are or are not going to be hit, dismiss responsibility and leave it all to fate.  I must admit that in my brief experience I was not able to arrive at this restful state.  We reached at last the city gate through which we had left Antwerp, and the motor came to a stop just at the inner edge of the passage under the fort, and I said good-by to the young Englishman ere he started back for the trenches again.  \"Well,\" he called after me as I started across the open space between the gate and the houses, a stone's throw away, \"you've had an experience anyway.\"  I was just about to answer that undoubtedly I had when-- \"Tzee-ee-ee-er-r\"--a shell just cleared the ramparts over our heads and disappeared in the side of a house directly in front of us with a roar and a geyser of dust.
