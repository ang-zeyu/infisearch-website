He was very weary from his former journey; but, mindful of his duty, he started for the forest, reaching it before the day was over. He searched for the earring faithfully, following the road which he and the Princess had taken; but all in vain. He was much discouraged, and sat down under a tree to rest. To his surprise a mouse of monstrous size appeared before him. It was the King of the Mice.  \"Why are you so sad?\" asked the Mouse.  \"I am searching for an earring which the Princess lost as we passed through the forest, but am unable to find it.\"  \"I will find it for you,\" said the King-Mouse.  Benito's face brightened at hearing this. The King-Mouse called all his followers, and all but one little mouse responded. Then the King of the Mice ordered some of his subjects to find the absent one. They found him in a small hole among the bamboo-trees. He said he could not go because he was so satisfied (sated). So the others pulled him along to their master; and he, finding that there was something hard within the little mouse, ordered him to be cut open. It was done; and there was the very earring for which the tired servant was looking. Benito took it, thanked the King of the Mice, and brought the earring to his own King.  When the monarch received it, he immediately restored it to its owner and asked, \"Will you now become my wife?\"  \"Oh, dear King!\" responded the Princess, \"I have only one more thing to ask of you; and if you will grant it, I will be your wife forever.\"  The King, pleased with his former successes, said, \"Tell me what it is, and it shall be granted.\"  \"If you will get some water from heaven,\" said the Princess, \"and some water from the nether-world, I will become your wife. That is my last wish.\"  The King called Benito, and commanded him to get water from these two places. \"I will, my King,\" said Benito; and he took some provisions and started. He came to the forest; but there he became confused, for he did not know in which direction to go to reach either of the places. Suddenly he recalled the promise of the bird he had helped the first time he entered the wood. He called the bird, and it soon appeared. He told it what he wanted, and it said, \"I will get it for you.\"  He made two cups of bamboo, and tied one to each of the bird's legs. They were very light, and did not hinder the bearer at all. Away the bird flew, going very fast. Before the day was ended, it came back with each cup full of water, and told Benito that the one tied to its right leg contained water from heaven, and the one tied to its left leg contained water from the nether-world.  Benito untied the cups, taking great care of them. He was about to leave, when the bird asked him to tarry long enough to bury it, as the places to which it had been were so far away that it was weary unto death.  Benito did not like to bury the bird, but he soon saw that it really was dying, so he waited; and when it was dead, he buried it, feeling very sorry over the loss of so helpful a friend.  He went back to the palace and delivered the two kinds of water to his master. The Princess then asked the King to cut her in two and pour the water from heaven upon her. The King was not willing to do it, so she did it herself, asking the King to pour the water. This he did, and, lo! the Princess turned into the most beautiful woman that ever the sun shone on.  Then the King was desirous of becoming handsome; so he asked the Princess to pour the other cup of water over him after he cut himself. He cut himself, and she poured over his body the water from the nether-world; but from him there arose a spirit more ugly and ill-favored than imagination could picture. Fortunately, it soon vanished from sight.  The Princess then turned to Benito, and said, \"You have been faithful in your duties to your master, kind to me in restoring the jewels I lost, and brave in delivering me from the cruel giants. You are the man I choose for my husband.\"  Benito could not refuse so lovely a lady. They were married amid great festivities, and became the king and queen of that broad and fertile land.  Benito gave his parents one of the finest portions of his kingdom, and furnished them with everything they could desire. From that time on they were all very happy,--so happy that the story of their bliss has come down through the centuries to us.     PART II  Visayan Folk-Tales.   Introduction.  These stories are intended to bring before the American public a few of the tales related by Visayan parents to their children, or by the public story-teller in the market, as the people gather to buy the material for the evening meal. It was only toward the close of a three years' stay in the Islands, in one province, and in neighboring places, and after a fair acquaintance with Spanish and a little knowledge of the native dialect had enabled us to obtain a closer insight into the home life of our pupils than would otherwise have been possible, that we ventured upon the collection of these tales, hoping that they might prove of interest to people at home. Many of the stories were written by our boys and girls as part of their work in English composition. Others were prepared by the native teachers, some of whom had been well educated by the Spaniards and had already learned to write very fair English. Indeed, a few were able, at about the time that these stories were written, to pass the civil service examination for appointment as insular teachers. The articles on the superstitious beliefs of the people were prepared by one of these teachers, so that they might be as nearly correct as possible.  As might be expected, the stories are often very crude and simple, presenting no difficult situations nor intricate plots. Sometimes they resemble well-known tales from other lands, although great care has been taken to collect only those from original sources.  The tales here presented were collected during the spring of 1904, in the island of Panay, belonging to the Visayan group of the Philippine Islands, and were obtained in our own class rooms, from native teachers and pupils. Mr. Maxfield was stationed at Iloilo, and Mr. Millington at Mandurriao, places five miles apart. We daily came in contact with about one thousand pupils. The tales were gathered in both places, and were found to be substantially alike, the differences being only in petty details. After collecting one version, we endeavored to ascertain whether the same narrative was current among natives in other localities of the island. We were surprised to discover that they seemed to be known wherever we became acquainted with the people and had obtained their confidence sufficiently to induce them to talk freely. There were often variations, but the framework was always the same. If any stories were obtained from native teachers who knew Spanish, we have always verified them by getting children or natives from other places, who knew no Spanish, to relate them, in order to assure ourselves that the narrative could not be a mere translation of a Spanish tale.  We who have collected these stories can claim little credit for any more than the mere arrangement of them, as, so far as possible, even the wording of the original manuscripts has been retained. Doubtless, much of the interest we have felt in the work is due to our personal acquaintance with the writers who put on paper for us these simple tales, yet we hope that they will not be wholly unattractive to those for whose sake they have been collected.  February, 1906.  B. L. M.  W. H. M.   CHAPTER 1  How Jackyo Became Rich.  A long time ago there was a young man whose name was Jackyo. He was very poor, and by his daily labor could earn barely enough for his food and nothing at all for his clothes. He had a little farm at some distance from the village in which he lived, and on it raised a few poor crops.  One pleasant afternoon Jackyo started off to visit his farm. It was late when he reached it, and after he had finished inspecting his crops, he turned back homewards. But the bright day had gone and the sun had set. Night came on quickly, and the way was dark and lonely.  At last he could no longer see the road. Not a star was to be seen, and the only sounds he heard were the sad twitterings of the birds and soft rustling of the leaves as they were moved by the wind.  At last he entered a thick forest where the trees were very big. \"What if I should meet some wild beast,\" thought Jackyo; but he added half aloud, \"I must learn to be brave and face every danger.\"  It was not long before he was very sure that he could hear a deep roar. His heart beat fast, but he walked steadily forward, and soon the roar was repeated, this time nearer and more distinctly, and he saw in the dim light a great wild ox coming towards him.  He found a large hole in the trunk of a huge tree. \"I will pass the night here in this tree,\" he said to himself.  In a little while an old man appeared. His body was covered with coarse hair and he was very ugly. He looked fiercely at Jackyo from head to foot and said: \"What are you thinking of to come in here? Do you not know that this is the royal castle of the king of evil spirits?\"  Jackyo became more frightened than before and for a long time he could not speak, but at last he stammered: \"Excuse me, sir, but I cannot go home on account of the dark night. I pray you to let me rest here for a short time.\"  \"I cannot let you stay here, because our king is not willing to help any one who does not belong to his kingdom. If he did so, his kingdom would be lost. But what is your name? Do you know how to sing?\" said the old man.  \"My name is Jackyo, and I know a little bit about singing,\" replied Jackyo.  \"Well,\" said the old man, \"if you know any song, sing for me.\" Now Jackyo knew but one song, and that was about the names of the days of the week except Sunday. He did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11028"],["title","Philippine Folk-Tales (#3)"],["body","to sing it, but the old man urged him, saying: \"If you do not sing, I will cut your head off.\" So Jackyo began to sing.  It happened that the king [5] of the evil spirits, whose name was Mensaya, heard Jackyo's song and was very much interested in it. He called a servant, named Macquil, and said: \"Macquil, go downstairs and see who is singing down there, and when you find him, bring him to me.\"  Jackyo went before the king, bowed to the floor, touching the carpet with his forehead, and stood humbly before the king.  \"Let me hear your song,\" said the king. So Jackyo, with great respect, sang the only song he knew. Here it is:      Mon-day, Tues-day, Wednesday, Thurs-day, Fri-day, Sat-ur-day.  While he was singing, all the evil spirits in the cave gathered around him to hear his song, and Mensaya asked him to sing it over and over again. They were all so pleased with it that Mensaya ordered Macquil to give Jackyo a large quantity of gold and silver as a reward for his beautiful song.  When the morning came Jackyo returned home, full of joy, and became known as the richest man in the village.   CHAPTER 2  Truth and Falsehood.  One day Truth started for the city to find some work. On his way he overtook Falsehood, who was going to the city for the same purpose. Falsehood asked permission to ride on the horse with Truth, and his request was granted.  On the way they questioned each other as to the sort of work they wanted. Truth stated that he intended to be a secretary, so that he might always be clean and white. Falsehood declared that he would be a cook, because then he would always have plenty of fine things to eat.  As they were riding along, they met a man carrying a corpse to the cemetery. He had no one to help him, and Truth, in his great pity for the man, jumped off his horse and helped him. After the corpse was buried, Truth asked: \"Did you pray for the repose of the soul of the dead?\" \"No,\" was the reply, \"I do not know how to pray, and I have no money to pay the priest for candles.\" Then Truth gave the man all the money he had, that he might have prayers said for the dead man, and went back to his companion.  When dinner time came, Falsehood was very angry at finding out that Truth had given all his money away, but finally proposed that they should go to the river and catch some fish for dinner. When they arrived at the river, they found some fish which had been caught in a shallow pool near the bank, and caught all they wanted. But Truth was very sorry for the fish, and threw his half back into the river. Falsehood murmured at him and said: \"It would have been better for you to give them to me. If I had known that you would throw them into the river, I would not have given you any of them.\" Then they rode on. As they were going through a thick wood in the heart of the mountain they heard a noise as of crying, far away. Truth went forward to find what it was, but Falsehood, trembling with fear, hid himself close behind his comrade. At last they saw seven little eagles in a nest high in a tree. They were crying with hunger, and their mother was nowhere to be seen. Truth was sorry for them, and killed his horse, giving some of the meat to the young eagles, and spreading the rest on the ground beneath the tree, so that the mother-bird might find it.  Falsehood hated his comrade for having killed the horse, because now they were obliged to travel on foot. They went down the mountain, and entering the city, presented themselves before the king, desiring to be taken into his service, the one as secretary and the other as cook. The king granted both requests.  When Falsehood saw that his former companion sat at the table with the king and was always clean and dressed in good clothes, while he himself was dirty and had to eat in the kitchen, he was very angry and determined to do something to ruin the one whom now he hated so bitterly.  One day the king and queen went to sail on the sea. As they were far from land, the queen dropped her ring overboard. When Falsehood heard of the accident, he went to the king and said: \"My Lord, the King, my friend--your secretary--has told me that he was endowed with magic powers and is able to find the queen's ring. He says if he does not find it he is willing for you to hang him.\"  The king immediately sent for Truth, and said to him: \"Find the queen's ring without delay, or I will have you hanged early to-morrow morning.\"  Truth went down to the shore, but seeing how impossible it would be to find the ring, began to weep. A fish came near, and floating on top of the water, asked, \"Why are you weeping?\"  \"I weep,\" Truth replied, \"because the king will hang me early to-morrow morning unless I find the queen's ring, which has fallen into the sea.\"  The fish swam out and got the ring and gave it to Truth. Then he said: \"I am one of the fishes which you found on the bank of the river and threw back into the water. As you helped me when I was in trouble, I am very glad that I have been able to help you now.\"  On another day, Falsehood went to the king and said: \"My Lord King, do you remember what I told you the other day?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the king, \"and I believe you told me the truth, as the ring has been found.\"  \"Well,\" replied Falsehood, \"my friend told me last night that he is a great magician and that he is willing for you to hang him in the sight of all the people, since it will not hurt him.\"  The king sent for Truth and told him: \"I know what you have said to your friend. To-morrow I will have you hanged in the sight of all the people, and we will see whether you are the great magician you claim to be.\"  That night Truth could not sleep. About midnight, as he was in great distress, a spirit suddenly appeared to him and asked what was the cause of his grief. Truth related his trouble, and the spirit said: \"Do not weep. To-morrow morning I will take your form and wear your clothes, and let them hang me.\"  The next morning, just at dawn, the spirit put on Truth's clothes and went out to be hanged. Many people came to see the hanging, and after it was over, returned to their homes. What was the astonishment of the king and those with him when, upon their return to the palace, they found Truth there before them, alive and well!  That night the spirit appeared to Truth and said: \"I am the spirit of the dead man for whom you gave your money that prayers might be said for the repose of his soul.\" Then it disappeared.  On another day Falsehood appeared before the king and said: \"My Lord the King, my friend the secretary told me last night that if you would let him marry your daughter, in one night his wife should bring forth three children.\" The king sent for Truth and said: \"I will give you my daughter to be your wife and if to-night she does not bear three children, I will have you buried alive to-morrow morning.\"  So they were married. But at midnight, as Truth lay awake thinking of the fate that was in store for him in the morning, an eagle flew through the window, and asked the cause of his sorrow. Truth related his tale, and the eagle said: \"Do not worry; I will take care of that.\" Then he flew away, but just before the break of day three eagles came, each bearing a new-born babe. Truth awakened the princess and said to her: \"My dear wife, these are our children. We must love them and take good care of them.\"  Then the king, who had been awakened by the noise of children crying, sent to ask what it was all about. When he heard the news he came into the tower where the princess was, and when he saw the children he was overcome with joy; for he had no sons, and greatly desired to have an heir to his throne. So the king made a great feast and gave over his crown and sceptre to his son-in-law, to be king in his stead.  Thus we see that those who help others when in trouble shall themselves be aided when they are in difficulty.   CHAPTER 3  Camanla and Parotpot.  Camanla was a very poor but very busy man, and always praising his own work. When he talked with other people he ended every third or fourth word with \"la,\" which was the last syllable of his name and is a word of praise.  One day he made a boat, and when it was finished he began to talk to it. These were his words: \"My boat, la, you may go, la, to find a pretty lady, la, for my wife, la, to make me happy, la.\" Then his boat started to sail without anybody to manage it. When she reached a large town she stopped in the river, near where the pretty daughters of some rich men of the town were taking a walk. They were accustomed to take any boat they might find and use it when they wished to cross the river, returning in the same way.  As Camanla's boat was there and looked very fine, the young ladies decided to cross the river in it. The youngest was the first to jump into the boat. When the little boat felt that some one had come on board, she ran away, carrying the lady.  When Camanla saw his boat coming, he began to praise it, saying: \"My boat, la, is coming, la, to bring me, la, my pretty lady, to marry me, la.\" Very soon the boat anchored, and he went down to receive the lady, whom he soon married. Then was Camanla happy, but one day he had no food to give his wife, so he made a little taon, or fish trap, and said to it: \"My pretty taon, la, you may go, la, to the river, la, to get me some fish, la.\" The taon then walked toward the river, and soon came back, full of fish. Camanla was an object of envy to all the world.  His happiness was soon heard of by his friend Parotpot, who became very envious. At last he went to Camanla's house. When he met his friend, he said to him: \"You are very happy, my friend, and I envy you.\" Camanla replied: \"Yes, I am very fortunate. I have my little boat that sails every day to get my food, and a little taon that goes to the river and brings me fine fish.\"  Parotpot returned sadly home. He concluded to build a boat like his friend's, but Parotpot, when he talked, ended every third"]]]
