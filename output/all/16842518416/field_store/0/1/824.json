The shells all appeared to be coming from a southeast direction, and in the lee of houses on the south side of the street one was reasonably protected.  Keeping close to the house-fronts and dodging--rather absurdly, no doubt--into doorways when that wailing whistle came up from behind, I went zigzagging through the deserted city toward the hotel on the other side of town.  It was such a progress as one might make in some fantastic nightmare--as the hero of some eerie piece of fiction about the Last Man in the World. Street after street, with doors locked, shutters closed, sandbags, mattresses, or little heaps of earth piled over cellar windows; streets in which the only sound was that of one's own feet, where the loneliness was made more lonely by some forgotten dog cringing against the closed door and barking nervously as one hurried past.  Here, where most of the shells had fallen the preceding night, nearly all the houses were empty.  Yet occasionally one caught sight of faces peering up from basement windows or of some stubborn householder standing in his southern doorway staring into space.  Once I passed a woman bound away from, instead of toward, the river with her big bundle; and once an open carriage with a family in it driving, with peculiarly Flemish composure, toward the quay, and as I hurried past the park, along the Avenue Van Dyck--where fresh craters made by exploding shells had been dug in the turf--the swans, still floating on the little lake, placidly dipped their white necks under water as if it were a quiet morning in May.  Now and then, as the shell's wail swung over its long parabola, there came with the detonation, across the roofs, the rumble of falling masonry.  Once I passed a house quietly burning, and on the pavement were lopped-off trees.  The impartiality with which those far-off gunners distributed their attentions was disconcerting.  Peering down one of the up-and-down streets before crossing it, as if a shell were an automobile which you might see and dodge, you would shoot across and, turning into a cosey little side street, think to yourself that here at least they had not come, and then promptly see, squarely in front, another of those craters blown down through the Belgian blocks.  Presently I found myself under the trees of the Boulevard Leopold, not far from the British hospital, and recalled that it was about time that promise was made good.  It was time indeed, and help with lifting they needed very literally.  The order had just come to leave the building, bringing the wounded and such equipment as they could pack into half a dozen motor-buses and retire--just where, I did not hear--in the direction of Ghent.  As I entered the porte-cochere two poor wrecks of war were being led out by their nurses--more men burned in the powder explosion at Waelhem, their seared faces and hands covered with oil and cotton just as they had been lifted from bed.  The phrase \"whistle of shells\" had taken on a new reality since midnight. Now one was to learn something of the meaning of those equally familiar words, \"they succeeded in saving their wounded, although under heavy fire.\"  None of the wounded could walk, none dress himself; most of them in ordinary times would have lain where they were for weeks.  There were fractured legs not yet set, men with faces half shot away, men half out of their heads, and all these had to be dressed somehow, covered up, crowded into or on top of the buses, and started off through a city under bombardment toward open country which might already be occupied by the enemy.  Bundles of uniforms, mud-stained, blood-stained, just as they had come from the trenches, were dumped out of the storeroom and distributed, hit or miss.  British \"Tommies\" went out as Belgians, Belgians in British khaki; the man whose broken leg I had lifted the day before we simply bundled in his bed blankets and set up in the corner of a bus.  One healthy-looking Belgian boy, on whom I was trying to pull a pair of British trousers, seemed to have nothing at all the matter with him, until it presently appeared that he was speechless and paralyzed in both left arm and left leg.  And while we were working, an English soldier, shot through the jaw and throat, sat on the edge of his bed, shaking with a hideous, rattling cough.  The hospital was in a handsome stone building, in ordinary times a club, perhaps, or a school; a wide, stone stairway led up the centre, and above it was a glass skylight.  This central well would have been a charming place for a shell to drop into, and one did drop not more than fifty feet or so away, in or close to the rear court.  A few yards down the avenue another shell hit a cornice and sent a ton or so of masonry crashing down on the sidewalk.  Under conditions like these the nurses kept running up and down that staircase during the endless hour or two in which the wounded were being dressed and carried on stretchers to the street.  They stood by the buses making their men comfortable, and when the first buses were filled they sat in the open street on top of them, patiently waiting, as calm and smiling as circus queens on their gilt chariots.  The behavior of the men in the trenches was cool enough, but they at least were fighting men and but taking the chance of war.  These were civilian volunteers, they had not even trenches to shelter them, and it took a rather unforeseen and difficult sort of courage to leave that fairly safe masonry building and sit smiling and helpful on top of a motor-bus during a wait of half an hour or so, any second of which might be one's last.  There was an American nurse there, a tall, radiant girl, whom they called, and rightly, \"Morning Glory,\" who had been introduced to me the day before because we both belonged to that curious foreign race of Americans.  What her name was I haven't the least idea, and if we were to meet to-morrow, doubtless we should have to be carefully presented over again, but I remember calling out to her, \"Good-by, American girl!\" as we passed in the hall during the last minute or two, and she said good-by, and suddenly reached out and put her hand on my shoulder and added, \"Good luck!\" or \"God bless you!\" or something like that.  And these seemed at the moment quite the usual things to do and say.  The doctor in charge and the general's wife apologized for running away, as they called it, and the last I saw of the latter was as she waved back to me from the top of a bus, with just that look of concern over the desperate ride they were beginning which a slightly preoccupied hostess casts over a dinner-table about which are seated a number of oddly assorted guests.  The strange procession got away safely at last, and safely, too, so I was told later, across the river; but where they finally spent the night I never heard.  I hurried down the street and into the Rue Nerviens.  It must have been about four o'clock by that time.  The bright October morning had changed to a chill and dismal afternoon, and up the western sky in the direction of the river a vast curtain of greasy, black smoke was rolling. The petrol-tanks along the Scheldt had been set afire.  It looked at the moment as if the whole city might be going, but there was no time then to think of possibilities, and I slipped down the lee side of the street to the door with the Red Cross flag.  The front of the hospital was shut tight.  It took several pulls at the bell to bring any one, and inside I found a Belgian family who had left their own house for the thicker ceilings of the hospital, and the nuns back in the wards with their nervous men.  Their servants had left that morning, the three or four sisters in charge had had to do all the cooking and housework as well as look after their patients, and now they were keeping calm and smiling, to subdue as best they could the fears of the Belgian wounded, who were ready to jump out of bed, whatever their condition, rather than fall into the hands of the enemy.  Each had no doubt that if he were not murdered outright he would be taken to Germany and forced to fight in the east against the Russians.  Several, who knew very well what was going on outside, had been found by the nurses that morning out of bed and all ready to take to the street.  Lest they should hear that their comrades in the Boulevard Leopold had been moved, the lay sister--the English lady--and I withdrew to the operating-room, closed the door, and in that curious retreat talked over the situation.  No orders had come to leave; in fact, they had been told to stay.  They did have a man now in the shape of the Belgian gentleman, and from the same source an able-bodied servant, but how long these would stay, where food was to be found in that desolate city, when the bombardment would cease, and what the Germans would do with them--well, it was not a pleasant situation for a handful of women.  But it was not of themselves she was thinking, but of their wounded and of Belgium, and of what both had suffered already and of what might yet be in store. It was of that this frail little sister talked that hopeless afternoon, while the smoke in the west spread farther up the sky, and she would now and then pause in the middle of a syllable while a shell sang overhead, then take it up again.  Meanwhile the light was going, and before it became quite dark and my hotel deserted, perhaps, as the rest of Antwerp, it seemed best to be getting across town.  I could not believe that the Germans could treat such a place and people with anything but consideration and told the little nurse so.  She came to the edge of the glass-covered court, laughingly saying I had best run across it, and wondering where we, who had met twice now under such curious circumstances, would meet again."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11011"],["title","A Hilltop on the Marne (#0)"],["body","HILLTOP ON THE MARNE  By Mildred Aldrich  Being Letters Written June 3-September 8, 1914       Note To Tenth Impression   The author wishes to apologize for the constant use of the word English in speaking of the British Expedition to France.  At the beginning of the war this was a colloquial error into which we all fell over here, even the French press.  Everything in khaki was spoken of as \"English,\" even though we knew perfectly well that Scotch, Irish, and Welsh were equally well represented in the ranks, and the colors they followed were almost universally spoken of as the \"English flag.\" These letters were written in the days before the attention of the French press was called to this error of speech, which accounts for the mistake's persisting in the book.  La Creste, Huiry,  France, February, 1916.     To My Grandmother Judith Trask Baker That Staunch New Englander And Pioneer Universalist To The Memory Of Whose Courage And Example I Owe A Debt Of Eternal Gratitude     A HILLTOP ON THE MARNE  June 3, 1914  Well, the deed is done.  I have not wanted to talk with you much about it until I was here.  I know all your objections.  You remember that you did not spare me when, a year ago, I told you that this was my plan.  I realize that you--more active, younger, more interested in life, less burdened with your past--feel that it is cowardly on my part to seek a quiet refuge and settle myself into it, to turn my face peacefully to the exit, feeling that the end is the most interesting event ahead of me--the one truly interesting experience left to me in this incarnation.  I am not proposing to ask you to see it from my point of view.  You cannot, no matter how willing you are to try.  No two people ever see life from the same angle.  There is a law which decrees that two objects may not occupy the same place at the same time--result: two people cannot see things from the same point of view, and the slightest difference in angle changes the thing seen.  I did not decide to come away into a little corner in the country, in this land in which I was not born, without looking at the move from all angles.  Be sure that I know what I am doing, and I have found the place where I can do it.  Some time you will see the new home, I hope, and then you will understand.  I have lived more than sixty years.  I have lived a fairly active life, and it has been, with all its hardships--and they have been many--interesting.  But I have had enough of the city--even of Paris, the most beautiful city in the world. Nothing can take any of that away from me.  It is treasured up in my memory.  I am even prepared to own that there was a sort of arrogance in my persistence in choosing for so many years the most seductive city in the world, and saying, \"Let others live where they will--here I propose to stay.\" I lived there until I seemed to take it for my own--to know it on the surface and under it, and over it, and around it; until I had a sort of morbid jealousy when I found any one who knew it half as well as I did, or presumed to love it half as much, and dared to say so.  You will please note that I have not gone far from it.  But I have come to feel the need of calm and quiet--perfect peace.  I know again that there is a sort of arrogance in expecting it, but I am going to make a bold bid for it.  I will agree, if you like, that it is cowardly to say that my work is done.  I will even agree that we both know plenty of women who have cheerfully gone on struggling to a far greater age, and I do think it downright pretty of you to find me younger than my years.  Yet you must forgive me if I say that none of us know one another, and, likewise, that appearances are often deceptive.  What you are pleased to call my \"pride\" has helped me a little.  No one can decide for another the proper moment for striking one's colors.  I am sure that you--or for that matter any other American--never heard of Huiry.  Yet it is a little hamlet less than thirty miles from Paris. It is in that district between Paris and Meaux little known to the ordinary traveler.  It only consists of less than a dozen rude farm-houses, less than five miles, as a bird flies, from Meaux, which, with a fair cathedral, and a beautiful chestnut-shaded promenade on the banks of the Marne, spanned just there bylines of old mills whose water-wheels churn the river into foaming eddies, has never been popular with excursionists.  There are people who go there to see where Bossuet wrote his funeral orations, in a little summer-house standing among pines and cedars on the wall of the garden of the Archbishop's palace, now, since the \"separation,\" the property of the State, and soon to be a town museum.  It is not a very attractive town.  It has not even an out-of-doors restaurant to tempt the passing automobilist.  My house was, when I leased it, little more than a peasant's hut.  It is considerably over one hundred and fifty years old, with stables and outbuildings attached whimsically, and boasts six gables.  Is it not a pity, for early association's sake, that it has not one more?  I have, as Traddles used to say, \"Oceans of room, Copperfield,\" and no joking.  I have on the ground floor of the main building a fair sized salon, into which the front door opens directly.  Over that I have a long, narrow bed-room and dressing-room, and above that, in the eaves, a sort of attic work-shop.  In an attached, one-story addition with a gable, at the west of the salon, I have a library lighted from both east and west.  Behind the salon on the west side I have a double room which serves as dining and breakfast-room, with a guest-chamber above.  The kitchen, at the north side of the salon, has its own gable, and there is an old stable extending forward at the north side, and an old grange extending west from the dining-room.  It is a jumble of roofs and chimneys, and looks very much like the houses I used to combine from my Noah's Ark box in the days of my babyhood.  All the rooms on the ground floor are paved in red tiles, and the staircase is built right in the salon.  The ceilings are raftered.  The cross-beam in the salon fills my soul with joy--it is over a foot wide and a foot and a half thick.  The walls and the rafters are painted green,--my color,--and so good, by long trial, for my eyes and my nerves, and my disposition.  But much as I like all this, it was not this that attracted me here. That was the situation.  The house stands in a small garden, separated from the road by an old gnarled hedge of hazel.  It is almost on the crest of the hill on the south bank of the Marne,--the hill that is the water-shed between the Marne and the Grand Morin. Just here the Marne makes a wonderful loop, and is only fifteen minutes walk away from my gate, down the hill to the north.  From the lawn, on the north side of the house, I command a panorama which I have rarely seen equaled.  To me it is more beautiful than that we have so often looked at together from the terrace at Saint-Germain. In the west the new part of Esbly climbs the hill, and from there to a hill at the northeast I have a wide view of the valley of the Marne, backed by a low line of hills which is the water-shed between the Marne and the Aisne.  Low down in the valley, at the northwest, lies lie de Villenoy, like a toy town, where the big bridge spans the Marne to carry the railroad into Meaux.  On the horizon line to the west the tall chimneys of Claye send lines of smoke into the air.  In the foreground to the north, at the foot of the hill, are the roofs of two little hamlets,--Joncheroy and Voisins,--and beyond them the trees that border the canal.  On the other side of the Marne the undulating hill, with its wide stretch of fields, is dotted with little villages that peep out of the trees or are silhouetted against the sky-line,--Vignely, Trilbardou, Penchard, Monthyon, Neufmortier, Chauconin, and in the foreground to the north, in the valley, just halfway between me and Meaux, lies Mareuil-on-the-Marne, with its red roofs, gray walls, and church spire. With a glass I can find where Chambry and Barcy are, on the slope behind Meaux, even if the trees conceal them.  But these are all little villages of which you may never have heard. No guidebook celebrates them.  No railroad approaches them.  On clear days I can see the square tower of the cathedral at Meaux, and I have only to walk a short distance on the route nationale,--which runs from Paris, across the top of my hill a little to the east, and thence to Meaux and on to the frontier,--to get a profile view of it standing up above the town, quite detached, from foundation to clock-tower.  This is a rolling country of grain fields, orchards, masses of black-currant bushes, vegetable plots,--it is a great sugar-beet country,--and asparagus beds; for the Department of the Seine et Marne is one of the most productive in France, and every inch under cultivation.  It is what the French call un paysage riant, and I assure you, it does more than smile these lovely June mornings.  I am up every morning almost as soon as the sun, and I slip my feet into sabots, wrap myself in a big cloak, and run right on to the lawn to make sure that the panorama has not disappeared in the night. There always lie--too good almost to be true--miles and miles of laughing country, little white towns just smiling in the early light, a thin strip of river here and there, dimpling and dancing, stretches of fields of all colors--all so, peaceful and so gay, and so \"chummy\" that it gladdens the opening day, and makes me rejoice to have lived to see it.  I never weary of it. It changes every hour, and I never can decide at which hour it is the loveliest.  After all, it is a rather nice world.  Now get out your map and locate me.  You will not find Huiry.  But you can find Esbly, my nearest station on the main line of the Eastern Railroad.  Then you will find a little narrow-gauge road running from"]]]
