Scena prima.    _Enter Dion, Cleremont, _and_ Thrasiline.  _Cler_.     Here's not Lords nor Ladies.  _Dion_.    Credit me Gentlemen, I wonder at it.                 They receiv'd strict charge from the King to attend here:                 Besides it was boldly published, that no Officer should                 forbid any Gentlemen that desire to attend and hear.  _Cle_.      Can you guess the cause?  _Di_.        Sir, it is plain about the _Spanish_ Prince, that's come                 to marry our Kingdoms Heir, and be our Soveraign.  _Thra_.     Many (that will seem to know much) say, she looks                 not on him like a Maid in Love.  _Di_.        O Sir, the multitude (that seldom know any thing                 but their own opinions) speak that they would have; but                 the Prince, before his own approach, receiv'd so many                 confident messages from the State, that I think she's                 resolv'd to be rul'd.  _Cle_.      Sir, it is thought, with her he shall enjoy both these                 Kingdoms of _Cicilie_ and _Calabria_.  _Di_.        Sir, it is (without controversie) so meant. But 'twill                 be a troublesome labour for him to enjoy both these                 Kingdoms, with safetie, the right Heir to one of them                 living, and living so vertuously, especially the people                 admiring the bravery of his mind, and lamenting his                 injuries.  _Cle_.       Who, Philaster?  _Di_.        Yes, whose Father we all know, was by our late                 King of _Calabria_, unrighteously deposed from his                 fruitful _Cicilie_. My self drew some blood in those                Wars, which I would give my hand to be washed from.  _Cle_.       Sir, my ignorance in State-policy, will not let me                 know why _Philaster_ being Heir to one of these Kingdoms,                 the King should suffer him to walk abroad with such free                 liberty.  _Di_.        Sir, it seems your nature is more constant than to                 enquire after State news. But the King (of late) made a                 hazard of both the Kingdoms, of _Cicilie_ and his own,                 with offering but to imprison _Philaster_. At which the City                 was in arms, not to be charm'd down by any State-order or                 Proclamation, till they saw _Philaster_ ride through the                 streets pleas'd, and without a guard; at which they threw                 their Hats, and their arms from them; some to make                 bonefires, some to drink, all for his deliverance. Which                 (wise men say) is the cause, the King labours to bring in                 the power of a Foreign Nation to aw his own with.                             [ _Enter_ Galatea, Megra, _and a Lady_.  _Thra_.     See, the Ladies, what's the first?  _Di_.        A wise and modest Gentlwoman that attends the Princess.  _Cle_.      The second?  _Di_.        She is one that may stand still discreetly enough, and                 ill favour'dly Dance her Measure; simper when she is                 Courted by her Friend, and slight her Husband.  _Cle_.       The last?  _Di_.        Marry I think she is one whom the State keeps for                 the Agents of our confederate Princes: she'll cog and lie                 with a whole army before the League shall break: her                 name is common through the Kingdom, and the Trophies                 of her dishonour, advanced beyond _Hercules_-pillars.                 She loves to try the several constitutions of mens bodies;                 and indeed has destroyed the worth of her own body, by                 making experiment upon it, for the good of the                 Common-wealth.  _Cle_.       She's a profitable member.  _La_.        Peace, if you love me: you shall see these Gentlemen                 stand their ground, and not Court us.  _Gal_.      What if they should?  _Meg_.     What if they should?  _La_.        Nay, let her alone; what if they should? why, if                 they should, I say, they were never abroad: what                 Foreigner would do so? it writes them directly                 untravel'd.  _Gal_.      Why, what if they be?  _Meg_.     What if they be?  _La_.        Good Madam let her go on; what if they be? Why                 if they be I will justifie, they cannot maintain                 discourse with a judicious Lady, nor make a Leg,                 nor say Excuse me.  _Gal_.      Ha, ha, ha.  _La_.       Do you laugh Madam?  _Di_.        Your desires upon you Ladies.  _La_.        Then you must sit beside us.  _Di_.        I shall sit near you then Lady.  _La_.        Near me perhaps: But there's a Lady indures no                 stranger; and to me you appear a very strange fellow.  _Meg_.     Me thinks he's not so strange, he would quickly be                 acquainted.  _Thra_.     Peace, the King.                         [ _Enter_ King, Pharamond, Arethusa, _and Train_.  _King_.     To give a stronger testimony of love                 Than sickly promises (which commonly                 In Princes find both birth and burial                 In one breath) we have drawn you worthy Sir,                 To make your fair indearments to [our] daughter,                 And worthy services known to our subjects,                 Now lov'd and wondered at. Next, our intent,                 To plant you deeply, our immediate Heir,                 Both to our Blood and Kingdoms. For this Lady,                 (The best part of your life, as you confirm me,                 And I believe) though her few years and sex                 Yet teach her nothing but her fears and blushes,                 Desires without desire, discourse and knowledge                 Only of what her self is to her self,                 Make her feel moderate health: and when she sleeps,                 In making no ill day, knows no ill dreams.                 Think not (dear Sir) these undivided parts,                 That must mould up a Virgin, are put on                 To shew her so, as borrowed ornaments,                 To speak her perfect love to you, or add                 An Artificial shadow to her nature:                 No Sir; I boldly dare proclaim her, yet                 No Woman. But woo her still, and think her modesty                 A sweeter mistress than the offer'd Language                 Of any Dame, were she a Queen whose eye                 Speaks common loves and comforts to her servants.                 Last, noble son, (for so I now must call you)                 What I have done thus publick, is not only                 To add a comfort in particular                 To you or me, but all; and to confirm                 The Nobles, and the Gentry of these Kingdoms,                 By oath to your succession, which shall be                 Within this month at most.  _Thra_.     This will be hardly done.  _Cle_.       It must be ill done, if it be done.  _Di_.        When 'tis at best, 'twill be but half done,                 Whilst so brave a Gentleman's wrong'd and flung off.  _Thra_.     I fear.  _Cle_.      Who does not?  _Di_.         I fear not for my self, and yet I fear too:                 Well, we shall see, we shall see: no more.  _Pha_.      Kissing your white hand (Mistress) I take leave,                 To thank your Royal Father: and thus far,                 To be my own free Trumpet. Understand                 Great King, and these your subjects, mine that must be,                 (For so deserving you have spoke me Sir,                 And so deserving I dare speak my self)                 To what a person, of what eminence,                 Ripe expectation of what faculties,                 Manners and vertues you would wed your Kingdoms?                 You in me have your wishes. Oh this Country,                 By more than all my hopes I hold it                 Happy, in their dear memories that have been                 Kings great and good, happy in yours, that is,                 And from you (as a Chronicle to keep                 Your Noble name from eating age) do I                 Opine myself most happy. Gentlemen,                 Believe me in a word, a Princes word,                 There shall be nothing to make up a Kingdom                 Mighty, and flourishing, defenced, fear'd,                 Equall to be commanded and obey'd,                 But through the travels of my life I'le find it,                 And tye it to this Country. And I vow                 My reign shall be so easie to the subject,                 That every man shall be his Prince himself,                 And his own law (yet I his Prince and law.)                 And dearest Lady, to your dearest self                 (Dear, in the choice of him, whose name and lustre                 Must make you more and mightier) let me say,                 You are the blessed'st living; for sweet Princess,                 You shall enjoy a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10850"],["title","Philaster; Or, Love Lies a Bleeding (#1)"],["body","of men, to be                 Your servant; you shall make him yours, for whom                 Great Queens must die.  _Thra_.     Miraculous.  _Cle_.       This speech calls him _Spaniard_, being nothing but                 A large inventory of his own commendations.                                                  [_Enter_ Philaster.  _Di_.         I wonder what's his price? For certainly he'll tell                 himself he has so prais'd his shape: But here comes one                 more worthy those large speeches, than the large                 speaker of them? let me be swallowed quick, if I can                 find, in all the Anatomy of yon mans vertues, one sinew                 sound enough to promise for him, he shall be Constable.                 By this Sun, he'll ne're make King unless it be for trifles,                 in my poor judgment.  _Phi_.       Right Noble Sir, as low as my obedience,                 And with a heart as Loyal as my knee,                 I beg your favour.  _King_.    Rise, you have it Sir.  _Di_.        Mark but the King how pale he looks with fear.                 Oh! this same whorson Conscience, how it jades us!  _King_.     Speak your intents Sir.  _Phi_.       Shall I speak 'um freely?                 Be still my royal Soveraign.  _King_.    As a subject                 We give you freedom.  _Di_.        Now it heats.  _Phi_.       Then thus I turn                 My language to you Prince, you foreign man.                 Ne're stare nor put on wonder, for you must                 Indure me, and you shall. This earth you tread upon                 (A dowry as you hope with this fair Princess,                 Whose memory I bow to) was not left                 By my dead Father (Oh, I had a Father)                 To your inheritance, and I up and living,                 Having my self about me and my sword,                 The souls of all my name, and memories,                 These arms and some few friends, besides the gods,                 To part so calmly with it, and sit still,                 And say I might have been! I tell thee _Pharamond_,                 When thou art King, look I be dead and rotten,                 And my name ashes; For, hear me _Pharamond_,                 This very ground thou goest on, this fat earth,                 My Fathers friends made fertile with their faiths,                 Before that day of shame, shall gape and swallow                 Thee and thy Nation, like a hungry grave,                 Into her hidden bowels: Prince, it shall;                 By _Nemesis_ it shall.  _Pha_.      He's mad beyond cure, mad.  _Di_.        Here's a fellow has some fire in's veins:                 The outlandish Prince looks like a Tooth-drawer.  _Phi_.        Sir, Prince of Poppingjayes, I'le make it well appear                 To you I am not mad.  _King_.    You displease us.                 You are too bold.  _Phi_.      No Sir, I am too tame,                 Too much a Turtle, a thing born without passion,                 A faint shadow, that every drunken cloud sails over,                 And makes nothing.  _King_.     I do not fancy this,                 Call our Physicians: sure he is somewhat tainted.  _Thra_.     I do not think 'twill prove so.  _Di_.        H'as given him a general purge already, for all the                 right he has, and now he means to let him blood: Be                 constant Gentlemen; by these hilts I'le run his                 hazard, although I run my name out of the                 Kingdom.  _Cle_.      Peace, we are one soul.  _Pha_.     What you have seen in me, to stir offence,                 I cannot find, unless it be this Lady                 Offer'd into mine arms, with the succession,                 Which I must keep though it hath pleas'd your fury                 To mutiny within you; without disputing                 Your _Genealogies_, or taking knowledge                 Whose branch you are. The King will leave it me;                 And I dare make it mine; you have your answer.  _Phi_.       If thou wert sole inheritor to him,                 That made the world his; and couldst see no sun                 Shine upon any but thine: were _Pharamond_                 As truly valiant, as I feel him cold,                 And ring'd among the choicest of his friends,                 Such as would blush to talk such serious follies,                 Or back such bellied commendations,                 And from this present, spight of all these bugs,                 You should hear further from me.  _King_.    Sir, you wrong the Prince:                 I gave you not this freedom to brave our best friends,                 You deserve our frown: go to, be better temper'd.  _Phi_.       It must be Sir, when I am nobler us'd.  _Gal_.       Ladyes,                 This would have been a pattern of succession,                 Had he ne're met this mischief. By my life,                 He is the worthiest the true name of man                 This day within my knowledge.  _Meg_.      I cannot tell what you may call your knowledge,                 But the other is the man set in mine eye;                 Oh! 'tis a Prince of wax.  _Gal_.       A Dog it is.  _King_.     _Philaster_, tell me,                 The injuries you aim at in your riddles.  _Phi_.       If you had my eyes Sir, and sufferance,                 My griefs upon you and my broken fortunes,                 My want's great, and now nought but hopes and fears,                 My wrongs would make ill riddles to be laught at.                 Dare you be still my King and right me not?  _King_.    Give me your wrongs in private.                                                   [_They whisper_.  _Phi_.      Take them, and ease me of a load would bow strong Atlas.  _Di_.       He dares not stand the shock.  _Di_.        I cannot blame, him, there's danger in't. Every man                 in this age, has not a soul of Crystal for all men to                 read their actions through: mens hearts and faces are                 so far asunder, that they hold no intelligence. Do but                 view yon stranger well, and you shall see a Feaver                 through all his bravery, and feel him shake like a true                 Tenant; if he give not back his Crown again, upon the                 report of an Elder Gun, I have no augury.  _King_.    Go to:                 Be more your self, as you respect our favour:                 You'I stir us else: Sir, I must have you know                 That y'are and shall be at our pleasure, what fashion we                 Will put upon you: smooth your brow, or by the gods.  _Phi_.       I am dead Sir, y'are my fate: it was not I                 Said I was not wrong'd: I carry all about me,                 My weak stars led me to all my weak fortunes.                 Who dares in all this presence speak (that is                 But man of flesh and may be mortal) tell me                 I do not most intirely love this Prince,                 And honour his full vertues!  _King_.    Sure he's possest.  _Phi_.       Yes, with my Fathers spirit; It's here O King!                 A dangerous spirit; now he tells me King,                 I was a Kings heir, bids me be a King,                 And whispers to me, these be all my Subjects.                 'Tis strange, he will not let me sleep, but dives                 Into my fancy, and there gives me shapes                 That kneel, and do me service, cry me King:                 But I'le suppress him, he's a factious spirit,                 And will undo me: noble Sir, [your] hand, I am your                 servant.  _King_.    Away, I do not like this:                 I'le make you tamer, or I'le dispossess you                 Both of life and spirit: For this time                 I pardon your wild speech, without so much                 As your imprisonment.                                  [_Ex_. King, Pha. _and_ Are.  _Di_.         I thank you Sir, you dare not for the people.  _Gal_.       Ladies, what think you now of this brave fellow?  _Meg_.     A pretty talking fellow, hot at hand; but eye yon                 stranger, is not he a fine compleat Gentleman? O these                 strangers, I do affect them strangely: they do the rarest                 home things, and please the fullest! as I live, could                 love all the Nation over and over for his sake.  _Gal_.      Pride comfort your poor head-piece Lady: 'tis a                 weak one, and had need of a Night-cap.  _Di_.        See how his fancy labours, has he not spoke                 Home, and bravely? what a dangerous train                 Did he give fire to! How he shook the King,                 Made his soul melt within him, and his blood                 Run into whay! it stood upon his brow,                 Like a cold winter dew.  _Phi_.      Gentlemen,                 You have no suit to me? I am no minion:                 You stand (methinks) like men that would be Courtiers,                 If you could well be fiatter'd at a price,                 Not to undo your Children: y'are all honest:                 Go get you home again, and make your Country                 A vertuous Court, to which your great ones may,                 In their Diseased age, retire, and live recluse.  _Cle_.      How do you worthy Sir?  _Phi_.      Well, very well;                 And so well, that if the King please, I find                 I may live many years.  _Di_.        The King must please,                 Whilst we know what you are, and who you are,                 Your wrongs and [injuries]: shrink not, worthy Sir,                 But add your Father to you: in whose name,                 We'll waken all the gods, and conjure up                 The rods of vengeance, the abused people,                 Who like to raging torrents shall swell high,       "]]]
