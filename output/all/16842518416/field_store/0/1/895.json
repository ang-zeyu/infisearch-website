He was in nowise sorry for the summons. He had a hearty appetite at all times, and just now it was increased by his unrequited labor in turning the grindstone for Deacon Jones, as well as by the half-hour he had spent at his new task.  The Misses Grant did their own work, as I have before observed. They were excellent cooks, and the dinner now upon the table, though plain, was very savory and inviting. Andy's eyes fairly danced with satisfaction as they rested on the roast beef and vegetables, which emitted an odor of a highly satisfactory character. At the farmer's where he had last worked, the table had been plentifully supplied, but the cooking was very rudimentary.  \"Sit down, Andrew,\" said Miss Priscilla. \"I think that is your name.\"  \"They call me 'Andy,' ma'am.\"  \"That means Andrew. Shall I give you some meat?\"  \"Thank you, ma'am.\"  \"Will you have it rare or well done?\"  \"Well done, ma'am. I have it rare enough, anyhow.\"  \"Sophia, Andrew has made a joke,\" said Priscilla, with a decorous smile.  \"Just so, Priscilla,\" and Sophia smiled also.  \"I suppose your family has been reduced to poverty, Andrew, or you would not be seeking employment of this character?\"  \"True for you, ma'am,\" said Andy, with his mouth full.  \"How was your family property lost?\"  \"Faith, ma'am, by speculation,\" said Andy, hazarding a guess.  \"That is very sad. Sophia, we must never speculate.\"  \"Just so, Priscilla.\"  \"Or we might lose all our money.\"  \"And have to saw wood for a living,\" said Sophia, with another brilliant idea.  Andy was so amused at the picture thus suggested that he came near choking, but recovered himself, after a violent attack of coughing.  \"I am afraid, Sophia, we should scarcely make a living in that way,\" said Priscilla, with a smile.  \"Just so,\" acquiesced her sister.  \"How long have you been in this country, Andrew?\"  \"Six years, ma'am.\"  Andy kept at work industriously. His appetite proved to be quite equal to the emergency, but his evident enjoyment of the dinner only gratified the ladies, who, though eccentric, were kind-hearted, and not in the least mean.  \"What will I do, ma'am?\" asked our hero.  \"You may go on sawing wood.\"  So Andy resumed work, and worked faithfully during the afternoon. By this time there was a large pile of wood ready for the stove.  At half-past four Miss Priscilla appeared at the door.  \"Andrew,\" she said.  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"Do you feel tired?\"  \"A little, ma'am.\"  \"Does your mother know where you are?\"  \"No, ma'am.\"  \"Would you like to go home and tell her?\"  \"Yes, ma'am, I would.\"  \"You can go now or after supper, as you prefer.\"  \"Then I'll go now.\"  \"But remember, we want you to come back and sleep here. We do not feel safe without a man in the house.\"  Andy felt rather flattered at being referred to as a man.  \"I'll be back any time you name, ma'am,\" he said.  \"Then be here at nine o'clock.\"  \"Very well, ma'am.\"  Andy put on his coat and hurried home. He wanted to tell his mother and Mary the good news about his engagement at such unexpected good wages.  Mrs. Burke looked up inquiringly as he entered the house.  \"Where have you been, Andy?\" she asked. \"I thought I had lost you.\"  \"You don't lose me so easy, mother. Shure, I've been at work.\"  \"At work?\"  \"Yes--I've got a place.\"  \"What, already? You are lucky, Andy.\"  \"You'll think so, mother. How much do you think I get besides board, mind?\"  \"A dollar a week?\"  \"What do you say to three dollars?\"  \"You're a lucky boy, Andy. I'm glad for you.\"  \"What do you say to five dollars a week, mother?\" asked Andy, in exultation.  \"You're jokin' now, Andy,\" said his sister. \"I don't believe you've got a place at all.\"  \"I have, thin, and it's five dollars a week I'm to get. Ask the ould maids I'm workin' for.\"  \"The Miss Grants?\"  \"I expect so. They're mighty queer old ladies. One of 'm is always sayin' 'just so.'\"  \"That is Miss Sophia Grant.\"  \"Just so,\" said Andy, mimicking her.  \"You mustn't do that, Andy. Then it's them you're workin' for?\"  \"Yes, and they're mighty kind. I'm goin' back to sleep there to-night. They want a man to purtect them.\"  Mary laughed.  \"Do you call yourself a man, Andy? What could you do if a burglar tried to get in?\"  \"I'd give him what Paddy did the drum,\" said Andy.  \"Supper is ready,\" announced his mother.  It was a cheerful meal. Andy had done much better than his mother expected, and it seemed likely that they would get along in spite of her being discharged by Mrs. Preston.     CHAPTER VIII THE MIDNIGHT ALARM   \"It's time for me to be goin' back,\" said Andy, as the clock indicated twenty minutes to nine.  \"I wish you could sleep at home, Andy,\" said his mother.  \"They want me to purtect them,\" said our hero, with a little importance. \"I'll pack my clothes in a handkerchief.\"  \"I've got a little carpetbag,\" said his mother. \"That looks more respectable. When you have earned enough money, you must have a new suit of clothes.\"  \"How much will they cost, mother?\"  \"I think we can get a cheap suit for fifteen or twenty dollars. When you have got the money, we will call on the tailor and see.\"  \"Shure, I'll feel like a gentleman with a suit like that.\"  \"Mary, go and get the carpetbag. I've packed Andy's clothes all ready for him.\"  Mary soon reappeared with the carpetbag, and Andy set out on his return.  Presently, as the clock struck nine, he knocked at the door of the Misses Grant. The elder opened the door for him.  \"You are punctual, Andrew,\" she said, approvingly.  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"Are those your clothes?\" pointing to the bag he carried.  \"What few I've got, ma'am. I'm goin' to buy some more when I've got money enough.\"  \"That is right. We want you to look respectable.\"  \"Just so,\" remarked Sophia, who felt that it was time for her to speak.  Then a brilliant idea seized her.  \"If he was a girl, we could give him some of our dresses.\"  \"But he isn't,\" said matter-of-fact Priscilla.  \"Or if we were men,\" continued Sophia, with another brilliant idea.  \"But we are not.\"  \"Just so,\" assented her sister, now brought to the end of her suggestions.  By this time Andy was in the house, holding his cap in one hand, and his carpetbag in the other.  \"Do you feel tired?\" asked Priscilla.  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"Then, perhaps you would like to go to bed?\"  \"I would, if it's just the same to you, ma'am.\"  \"Very well, follow me, and I will show you your room. Sophia, perhaps you had better come, too.\"  They went up the front stairs. The house proper had two rooms on the lower floor, and the two chambers over them. But there was, besides, an extension behind, used as a kitchen, and over this was the room which had been used by John, the former servant.  \"This is your room, Andrew,\" said Miss Priscilla. \"Sophia, will you lift the latch?\"  The door being opened, revealed a small chamber, with the ceiling partly sloping. There were two windows. It was very plainly furnished, but looked very comfortable. Andy glanced about him with a look of satisfaction. It was considerably more attractive than the bed in the attic which he had occupied at the house of the farmer for whom he had last worked.  \"We've put the feather bed at the bottom, as it's summer,\" said Miss Priscilla.  \"All right, ma'am.\"  \"There's one thing you've forgotten, Priscilla,\" suggested Sophia.  \"What is that?\"  \"The gun.\"  \"Oh, yes. I am glad you reminded me of it. Andrew, can you fire off a gun?\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Andrew, glibly.  He had never done it, but he had seen a gun fired, and always wanted to make a trial himself.  \"As you are the only menfolks in the house, we should expect you to fire at any robbers that tried to enter the house.\"  \"Do you expect any, ma'am?\" asked Andy, eagerly.  \"No; but some might come. Of course, we cannot fire guns--it would be improper, as we are ladies.\"  \"Just so,\" interrupted Sophia.  \"So we shall leave that to you. Do you think you would dare to?\"  \"Would I dare, is it?\" asked Andy. \"Shure, I'd be glad of the chance.\"  \"I see you are brave. I'll show you the gun now.\"  She went to the closet in the corner of the room, and pointed out a big, unwieldy musket to Andy. It was in the corner.  \"Is it loaded, ma'am?\" he asked.  \"Yes; it has been loaded for a year or more. John never had occasion to use it, and I hope you won't. If any robber should come,\" added the kind-hearted spinster, \"perhaps you had better only shoot him in the arm, and not kill him.\"  \"Just as you say, ma'am.\"  \"I believe that is all I have to say. Sophia, shall we go to our own room?\"  \"Just so.\"  So the two maidens withdrew, and Andy was left to his own reflections. He undressed himself quickly, and deposited himself in the bed, which proved to be very comfortable.  He went to bed, but there was one thing that prevented his going to sleep. This was the gun. He had never even had one in his hand, and now there was one at his absolute disposal. It made him feel a sense of his importance to feel that, upon him, young as he was, devolved the duty of defending the house and its occupants from burglary.  \"And why not? Shure, I'm 'most a man,\" reflected Andy. \"I can shoot off a gun as well as anybody. I wonder will robbers come to-night!\" thought Andy.  He rather wished they would, so that he might have an excuse for firing the gun. However, of this there seemed very little chance, for had not Miss Priscilla said that it had been loaded for more than a year, and during all that time John had never had occasion to use it? This seemed rather discouraging.  \"I wonder would they let me go out gunning with it?\" thought Andy.  Somehow or other, he could not get his mind off the gun, and, after a lapse of an hour, he was as wide awake as ever.  Meanwhile, Priscilla and Sophia were both asleep, not being interested in the gun.  Finally it occurred to Andy that he would get up and look at the gun. He wanted to make sure that he understood how to fire it. It was important that he should do so, he reasoned to himself, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11111"],["title","Only an Irish Boy; Or, Andy Burke's Fortunes (#6)"],["body","might not a burglar come that very night? Then, suppose he was unable to fire the gun, and in consequence of his ignorance, both he and the two ladies should be murdered in their beds. Of course, this was not to be thought of, so Andy got out of bed, and, finding a match, lit the candle and put it on the bureau, or chest of drawers, as they called it in the country.  Then he stepped softly to the closet and took out the gun.  \"Murder! how heavy it is!\" thought Andy. \"I didn't think it was half as heavy. There must be a pound of bullets inside. Now,\" he said to himself, \"suppose a big thafe was to poke his dirty head in at the winder and say, 'Give me all your money, or I'll break your head'--I'd put up with the gun and point at him this way.\"  Here Andy brought the gun into position with some difficulty and put his finger near the trigger.  \"And I'd say,\" continued Andy, rehearsing his part, \"'Jump down, you thafe, or I'll put a bullet through your head.'\"  At that unlucky moment his finger accidentally pulled the trigger, and instantly there was a tremendous report, the noise being increased by the shattering of the window panes by the bullet.  Probably the charge was too heavy, for the gun \"kicked,\" and Andy, to his astonishment, found himself lying flat on his back on the floor, with the gun lying beside him.  \"Oh, murder!\" ejaculated the bewildered boy, \"is it dead I am? Shure, the divil's in the gun. What will the ould wimmen say? They'll think it's bloody burglars gettin' into the house. Shure, I'll slip on my pants, for they'll be coming to see what's happened.\"  He picked himself up, and slipped on his pants. He had scarcely got them on when the trembling voice of Miss Priscilla was heard at the door.     CHAPTER IX WHAT FOLLOWED   The report of the gun, as may be supposed, had aroused both the ladies from their sleep.  \"Did you hear it?\" ejaculated Miss Priscilla, clutching her sister by the arm.  \"Just so,\" muttered Sophia, in bewilderment. \"It's the gun.\"  \"Burglars!\" exclaimed Sophia, in alarm.  \"I am afraid so. What shall we do?\"  \"Run away,\" suggested Sophia.  \"No, we must not leave the boy to be murdered.\"  \"Perhaps he has shot them?\" said Sophia, with a gleam of hope.  \"At any rate, it is our duty to go and see what has happened.\"  \"I'm afraid,\" whimpered Sophia, covering up her head.  \"Then you can stay here,\" said the more courageous Priscilla. \"I will go.\"  \"And leave me alone?\"  \"I must.\"  \"I'll go too, then,\" said Sophia, her teeth chattering with fear.  So they crept out of bed, and throwing shawls over their shoulders, advanced into the entry, trembling with excitement and fear.  \"If we should find Andy weltering in his gore?\" suggested Priscilla.  \"Don't say such horrid things, or I shall scream,\" said her sister.  Then came the tremulous knock mentioned at the close of the last chapter.  Andy opened the door in person, and met the gaze of the two Miss Grants, Sophia almost ready to drop with fright.  \"Do you see any gore, Priscilla?\" she asked, tremulously.  \"Are you hurt, Andrew?\" asked the elder sister.  \"No, ma'am.\"  \"Did you fire the gun?\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"What made you? Did any burglars try to get in?\"  \"Not exactly, ma'am,\" said Andy; \"but I thought there might be some.\"  \"Did you see any?\"  \"Not exactly,\" said Andy, a little embarrassed; \"but I heard a noise.\"  \"Just so,\" said Sophia.  \"Why didn't you wait till they appeared at the window, Andrew?\"  \"Because, ma'am, they would fire at me first. I wanted to scare 'em away.\"  \"Perhaps you were right. You don't see any traces of them outside, do you?\"  \"You can look for yourself, ma'am.\"  The two ladies went to the window, which as already explained, had suffered from the discharge, and peered out timidly, but, of course, saw no burglars.  \"Are you sure there were any burglars, Andrew?\" asked Priscilla.  \"No, ma'am, I couldn't swear to it.\"  \"Well, no harm has been done.\"  \"Except breakin' the winder, ma'am.\"  \"Never mind; we will have that mended to-morrow.\"  \"Were you afraid, Andrew?\" asked Miss Sophia.  \"Not a bit,\" answered Andy, valiantly. \"I ain't afraid of burglars, as long as I have a gun. I'm a match for 'em.\"  \"How brave he is!\" exclaimed the timid lady. \"We might have been killed in our beds. I'm glad we hired him, Priscilla.\"  \"As there is nothing more to do, we had better go to bed.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"That's a bully way to get out of a scrape,\" said Andy to himself, as the ladies filed out of his chamber. \"I expected they'd scold me. Plague take the old gun--it kicks as bad as a mule. Oh, Andy, you're a lucky boy to get off so well.\"  The next day Andy obtained permission to take out the gun in the afternoon when his chores were done.  \"I want to get used to it, ma'am,\" he said. \"It kicked last night.\"  \"Dear me, did it?\" asked Sophia. \"I didn't know guns kicked. What do they kick with? They haven't got any legs.\"  Andy explained as well as he could what he meant by the gun's kicking, and said it was because it had not been used for a good while, and needed to be taken out.  \"It needs exercise, just like horses, ma'am,\" he said.  \"That is singular, Andrew,\" said Priscilla.  \"Just so,\" observed her sister.  \"It's a fact, ma'am,\" said Andy. \"It gets skittish, just like horses--but if I take it out sometimes, it'll be all right.\"  \"Very well, you may take it, only be careful.\"  \"Oh, I'll be careful, ma'am,\" said Andy, with alacrity.  \"Now, I'll have some fun,\" he said to himself.  He found a supply of powder and some shot in the closet, and proceeded to appropriate them.  \"Come back in time for supper, Andrew,\" said Miss Priscilla.  \"Yes, ma'am, I'm always on hand at meal times,\" answered our hero.  \"That's because he's hungry,\" said Sophia, brilliantly.  \"You're right, ma'am,\" said Andy; \"my stomach always tells me when it's supper time.\"  \"It's as good as a watch,\" said Priscilla, smiling.  \"And a good deal cheaper,\" observed Sophia, with another brilliant idea.  Andy started up the road with his gun over his shoulder. It was his intention after going a little distance to strike into the fields, and make for some woods not far away, where he thought there would be a good chance for birds or squirrels. He hadn't gone many steps before he encountered Godfrey Preston, his antagonist of three days previous.  Now, Godfrey hadn't seen or heard anything of Andy since that day. He had learned from his mother with great satisfaction that she had discharged Mrs. Burke from her employment, as this, he imagined, would trouble Andy. But of Andy himself he knew nothing, and was not aware that he had already secured a place. When he saw our hero coming along, his curiosity led him to stop and find out, if he could, where he was going with the gun he carried on his shoulder, and where he obtained it. So he looked intently at Andy, waiting for him to speak, but Andy preferred to leave that to him.  \"Whose gun is that?\" asked Godfrey, in the tone of one who was entitled to ask the question.  \"Shure, it belongs to the owner,\" said Andy, with a smile.  \"Of course, I know that,\" said Godfrey, impatiently. \"I'm not quite a fool.\"  \"Not quite,\" repeated Andy, emphasizing the last word in a way which made Godfrey color.  \"What do you mean?\" he said.  \"What do I mane? It was only your words I repeated.\"  \"Then, don't trouble yourself to repeat them--do you hear?\"  \"Thank you; I won't.\"  \"You didn't tell me whose gun that is.\"  \"No, I didn't.\"  \"Very likely you stole it,\" said Godfrey, provoked.  \"Maybe you'll go and tell the owner.\"  \"How can I when you haven't told me whose it is?\"  \"No more I did,\" said Andy with apparent innocence.  \"Where are you going with it?\"  \"Goin' out shootin'.\"  \"So I supposed.\"  \"Did you, now? Then what made you ask?\" returned Andy.  \"You are an impudent fellow,\" said Godfrey, provoked.  \"I never am impudent to gentlemen,\" said Andy, pointedly.  \"Do you mean to say that I am not a gentleman?\" demanded the other, angrily.  \"Suit yourself,\" said Andy, coolly.  \"You're only an Irish boy.\"  \"Shure, I knew that before. Why can't you tell me some news? I'm an Irish boy and I'm proud of the same. I'll never go back on ould Ireland.\"  \"The Irish are a low set.\"  \"Are they now? Maybe you never heard of Burke, the great orator.\"  \"What of him?\"  \"Shure, he was an Irishman; and isn't my name Andy Burke, and wasn't he my great-grandfather?\"  \"He must be proud of his great-grandson,\" said Godfrey, sarcastically.  \"I never axed him, but no doubt you're right. But it's time I was goin', or I shan't get any birds. Would you like to come with me?\"  \"No, I am particular about the company I keep.\"  \"I'm not, or I wouldn't have invited you,\" said Andy, who was rather quicker witted than his opponent.  \"I should like to know where he got that gun,\" said Godfrey to himself, following with his eyes the retreating figure of our hero. \"I am sure that isn't his gun. Ten to one he stole it from somebody.\"  But Godfrey's curiosity was not destined to be gratified that afternoon, as it might have been if he had seen Andy turning into the yard of the Misses Grant two hours afterward. He had not shot anything, but he had got used to firing the gun, and was not likely to be caught again in any such adventure as that recorded in the last chapter.     CHAPTER X ANDY'S DEBUT AT SCHOOL   The first of September came, and with it came the opening of the fall schools. On the first day, when Andy, at work in the yard, saw the boys and the girls go by with their books, he felt a longing to go, too. He knew very well that his education had been very much neglected, and that he knew less of books than a boy of his age ought to do.  \"I wish I could go to school this term,\" he said to himself; \"but it's no use wishin'. Mother needs my wages, and I must keep on workin'.\"  The same thought had come to the Misses Grant. Andy had been in their employ now for six weeks, and by his unfailing good humor and readiness to oblige, had won their favor. They felt"]]]
