How much such discourses are needed in this place, I leave you to judge from the following extract from the _New Orleans Guide_:--  \"The greatest market-day is Sunday. At break of day the gathering commences,--youth and age--beauty and not so beautiful--all colours, nations, and tongues are co-mingled in one heterogeneous mass of delightful confusion. The traveller who leaves the city without visiting one of the popular markets on Sunday morning has suffered a rare treat to escape him.\"  On the evening of the next day, being the first Monday in the month, I went to the \"Concert\" for prayer, which had been announced the day before. It was held in a vestry or a school-room under the church. About sixty or seventy persons were in attendance. When I got there, they were singing the last verse of    \"O'er the gloomy Mils of darkness,\" &c.  A gentleman then gave an address. His object was to show that extensive fields were open in various parts of the world for the introduction of the Gospel. There was nothing clerical in his appearance, and he boggled a great deal; but, as he said \"We, the ministers of the Gospel,\" I inferred that he was the pastor of some other Presbyterian church in the city. Behind the desk, where sat Dr. S----, was hung up a missionary map of the world, drawn on canvas, and illuminated from behind. It was an excellent device. All missionary prayer-meetings should be furnished with one. Those parts where the Gospel is already preached were light, the realms of Heathenism dark, the lands of Popery red, and so forth.  After the address, the pastor called upon \"Brother Franklin\" to \"lead in prayer.\" The phrase was new to me, but I liked it,--it was appropriate. The prayer was scriptural and good, as was that also of another brother. The second prayed that the war, in which they were then as a nation engaged, might be overruled for good, and \"be the means of introducing the Gospel and free institutions to a neighbouring republic.\" Free institutions, indeed! (I said to myself): if you conquer, I fear it will be the means of introducing slavery where now it is not! After this prayer the pastor, having delivered a very short address, gave out a hymn, and said that while they were singing Brother such-a-one would \"take up the collection,\"--a phrase which seems to indicate a greater degree of preparation on the part of the people than our \"make a collection.\" The Americans suppose it to be already made, and nothing remains but to take it up. The good brother came round with an old hat to receive contributions for the cause of missions. The pastor then closed with a short prayer and the benediction. Upon the whole, there were indications of a considerable degree of warm-heartedness in reference to the missionary cause, and especially of tender sympathy and affection towards missionaries themselves. As one of the tribe, I found it rather difficult to preserve my _incog_. There were present about half-a-dozen black people, some on the right and some on the left of the pastor--\"the place of honour!\"     LETTER VI.  \"Jack Jones\"--A Public Meeting for Ireland--Henry Clay--Other Speakers--American Feeling in reference to the Irish Famine--A Slave-Auction.   On that dreadful day, the 28th of January, on which we arrived in New Orleans, Jack Jones, a Welshman, was drowned in the Mississippi, in a generous effort to save another man from a watery grave. In that effort he succeeded, but at the cost of his own life. On the 2nd of February there was an advertisement in the papers, in which his friends offered a reward for the recovery of the body. Where was the corporation, or some one of the municipalities? for the papers make a continual reference to first, second, and third municipalities. Was there no public body, either civil or humane, to come forward on such an occasion? Had \"Jack Jones\" gone to the war, and butchered a score or two of harmless Mexicans, he would have been loaded with honours; but he _saved_ a human being, close to the metropolis of the South, and his body was left to perish like that of a dog--for aught the citizens cared. I felt proud of my countryman. All honour to \"Jack Jones!\" May none of Cambria's sons perish in a cause less noble!  On the evening of the 4th of February I attended a public meeting for the relief of the Irish. It was held in the New Commercial Exchange, and was the first public meeting I had had an opportunity of attending in America. The Commercial Exchange is a fine large building, supported by pillars, and containing an area on the ground floor that would accommodate about 1,500 people. It is but ill-adapted for a public meeting, having no seats or benches. I found about 800 gentlemen present, but no ladies. Nor was that to be wondered at; for out of the 800, about 799 were spitting, 600 smoking cigars, 100 chewing tobacco, and perhaps 200 both chewing and smoking at the same time, for many of those people chew one end of the cigar while burning the other. There was a large platform, and a great number of gentlemen were upon it. Governor Johnson was the president, assisted by lots of vice-presidents. When I entered, a tall old gentleman, with rather high cheek bones, and a voice somewhat tremulous and nasal, was speaking. He descanted, in a second or third rate style, on the horrors of famine in Ireland,--its horrors especially as seen in the family. Coming to a period, he said, \"It is under these circumstances that I want you to put your hands into your pockets, and pull out something, and throw it into the lap of starving Ireland!\" This caused the most tremendous cheering I ever heard,--\"bravo--bravo--bravo,--whoo--hoo--whoo!\" The last sound was to me altogether new. Not having learned phonography, I can give you no adequate notion of it; but it was a combination of the owl's screech and the pig's scream. The favoured orator continued his speech a little longer, and at the close there was a storm of applause ten times more terrific than the former. And who was the speaker? It was none other, as I subsequently ascertained, than the celebrated Henry Clay! In departing from the tone of eulogy in which it is fashionable to speak of him, I may be charged with a want of taste and discrimination. That I cannot help. My simple object in these letters is to tell how Transatlantic men and manners appeared to my eye or ear. Before I went to America my respect for Henry Clay was very great. I am sorry to say it is not so now. I have closely examined his conduct in reference to \"the peculiar institution,\" and find it to have been that--not of a high-minded statesman and true philanthropist--but of a trimming, time-serving partisan. He has been a main pillar of slavery; and as the idol of the Whig party, a great stumbling-block in the way of those who sought the overthrow of that system. The man of whom I have thus freely, yet conscientiously expressed myself, is nevertheless thus spoken of in the _New Englander_, a quarterly review of high character now open before me:--\"We intend to speak in the praise of Henry Clay. His place among the great men of our country is permanently fixed. He stands forth prominent above the politicians of the hour, in the midst of the chosen few who are perpetual guardians of the interest and of the honour [slavery?] of the nation. The foundations of his fame are laid deep and imperishable, and the superstructure is already erected. It only remains that the mild light of the evening of life be shed around it.\"  The cheering at the close of Mr. Clay's speech merged into an awful tempest of barking. I could compare it to nothing else,--500 men barking with all their might! I thought it was all up with the meeting--that all was lost in incurable confusion; and yet the gentlemen on the platform looked down upon the raging tempest below with calmness and composure, as a thing of course. Amidst the noise I saw a middle-aged gentleman, rising on the platform, deliberately take off his top-coat, and all was hushed--except at the outskirts of the assembly, where a great trade in talking and tobacco was constantly carried on. This gentleman's name was S.S. Prentiss, Esq.; and the barking, it was now evident, consisted of calling out Prentiss! --Prentiss!--Prentiss! with all their might, on the top of the voice, and with an accent, sharp and rising, on the first syllable.  This gentleman gave us to understand that he was a lawyer--that he had often appeared before his fellow-citizens on former occasions (those occasions he briefly enumerated); but that the present was the most painful of all. He expatiated largely, and with great vehemence of tone and action, on the miseries of famine as experienced in Ireland,--talked much of their own glorious and free country--(\"Looking out for a few niggers this morning?\" occurred to me),--and made some severe reflections--not, I admit, altogether undeserved--on the Government of England. This man was fluent, though turgid. He seemed resolved to _act_ the orator throughout, and certainly to me appeared in point of talent far--far a-head of Henry Clay. Bravos and hoohoos in abundance greeted Mr. Prentiss. He spoke long; but the noise of the suburbs prevented my hearing so perfectly as I wished.  The cheering at the close of this speech merged into barking as before. In this instance it was Hunt!--Hunt!--Hunt! that they called for. The president (standing) showed them a sheet of paper, containing probably a list of subscriptions, and smiled coaxingly to intimate that he wished that to be read. But it would not do. Hunt!--Hunt!--Hunt! was still the cry; and the democracy, as before, carried the day.  By this time the atmosphere of the room had become so poisoned with smoking that I could endure it no longer. I had not only the general atmosphere to bear, but special puffs, right in my face, accompanying the questions and remarks which, in that free"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10898"],["title","American Scenes, and Christian Slavery (#8)"],["body","ng, of free citizens, in a free country, were freely put to me by the free-and-easy gentlemen around. The meeting resulted in the raising of 15,000 dollars for the relief of the Irish. The sum was handed by the American Minister in London to Lord John Russell; and a note from his Lordship, acknowledging the gift, has gone the round of the papers on both sides of the Atlantic. The subject of relief to Ireland was subsequently, in many ways and places, brought under my notice; and while I have been delighted in many instances with the display of pure and noble generosity, it was too evident that much of what was done was done in a spirit of self-glorification over a humbled and afflicted rival. It was a fine opportunity to feed the national vanity, and to deal hard blows to England. Not that I was sorry to see those blows, or to feel them. They drew no blood, and were a hundred times more efficacious than if they had. I felt that there was much in the conduct of England towards her unhappy sister-isle for which she deserved the severest castigation.  But I must protest against the form of putting the case, which was very common throughout the United States: \"You are shocked at our slavery; and yet you have horrors of ten times greater magnitude, in the Irish famine at your own doors.\" In this way the Irish famine, was a God-sent sort of a salvo for the slave-holder's conscience, so soothing and grateful to his tortured feelings that he was but too happy to pay for it by a contribution for the relief of Ireland.  In consequence of the following advertisement in the _Picayune_, I screwed up my feelings, and resolved for once at least in my life to see a slave-auction. I was the more disposed to attend this, as it was distinctly stated that they would be sold in families. I should not therefore have to behold the wife torn away from the husband, the husband from the wife, the parent from the child, or the child from the parent, as is so commonly done.  \"COTTON-FIELD HANDS.--By Beard, Calhoun, and Co., auctioneers.--Will be sold at auction, on Friday, the 5th inst., at 12 o'clock, at Bank's Arcade, thirty-seven Field Slaves; comprising eighteen from one plantation, and fourteen from another. All acclimated Negroes. To be sold in Families. Full particulars at sale.\"  \"F. 4.\"  Setting off a few minutes before 12, after about half-a-dozen inquiries, and as many \"guessing\" answers, I found \"Bank's Arcade.\" It was very near the Presbyterian church, in which I had heard such excellent sermons on the preceding Sabbath. It was a large open building: one side occupied as a bar for the retail of strong drinks, and the other fitted up for auctioneering purposes,--there being conveniences for three or four of the trade to exercise their vocation at the same time. One end was used for the sale of books and other publications, chiefly novels; and the other for the exhibition of fancy goods.  As I got in at one end, I heard a voice--with that peculiar, twirling, rapid, nasal twang, which marks the Transatlantic auctioneer--say, \"400 dollars for this fine young woman--only 400 dollars--420, only 420--430--440, only 440 dollars offered for this fine young woman.\" By this time I had got in front of the performer, and had a full view of the whole affair. And sure enough she was a \"fine young woman,\" about twenty-three years of age, neatly dressed, not quite----But the scene shall form the subject of my next letter.     LETTER VII.  The Slave-Auction (continued)--\"A Fine Young Woman\"--A Man and his Wife--Jim, the Blacksmith--A Family--A Ploughboy--Cornelia--Another Jim--Tom, the House-Boy--Edmund--Tom, and \"his reserved rights\"--A Carriage Driver--Margaret and her Child.   Yes, she _was_ a \"fine young woman,\" about 23 years of age, neatly dressed, not black, but slightly coloured. The auctioneer was a sleek-looking fellow, with a face that indicated frequent and familiar intercourse with the brandy-bottle. He stood upon a platform, about four feet high. Behind him was a table, at which a clerk sat to record the sales. High above was a semi-circular board, on which were written in large letters \"Beard, Calhoun, and Co.\" In front, standing upon a chair, exposed to the gaze of a crowd of men, stood the \"fine young woman.\" She had an air of dignity even in that degrading position. Around were twenty or thirty more of the sable race, waiting their turn.  \"440 dollars only offered,\" continued the coarse and heartless auctioneer; \"450, thank you; 460, 460 dollars only offered for this excellent young woman--470 only, 470--480, 480 dollars only offered--490--500 dollars offered--going for 500 dollars--once, going for 500 dollars--503 dollars--going for 503 dollars--going--once --twice--gone for 503 dollars. She is yours, sir,\" pointing to the highest bidder. She stepped down, and disappeared in the custody of her new proprietor.  A man and his wife, both black, were now put up. They were made to ascend the platform. \"Now, how much for this man and his wife? Who makes an offer? What say you for the pair? 550 dollars offered--560 dollars only; 560 dollars,\" &c., &c., till some one bidding 600 dollars--he added, \"Really, gentlemen, it is throwing the people away--going for 600 dollars; going--once--twice--gone for 600 dollars. They are yours, sir.\"  Jim, a blacksmith, about 30 years of age, was the next. He stood on the chair in front. \"Now, who bids for Jim? He is an excellent blacksmith; can work on a plantation, and make his own tools; in fact, can turn his hand to anything. The title is good,\"--(Is it, indeed? breathed I,)--\"and he is guaranteed free from all the vices and maladies provided against by law. Who bids for him? 600 dollars bid for him --625 dollars--650 dollars,\" and so on to 780. \"'Pon my soul, gentlemen, this is throwing the man away; he is well worth 1,200 dollars of anybody's money; 790 dollars only offered for him--going for 790 dollars;--going--once--twice--gone for 790 dollars.\"  The next \"lot\" was a family, consisting of the husband, a man slightly coloured, about 30 years of age, the wife about 25, quite black, and reminding me forcibly of an excellent woman in my own congregation, a little girl about 4 years of age, and a child in the arms. They were told to mount the platform. As they obeyed, I was attracted by a little incident, which had well nigh caused my feelings to betray me. Never shall I forget it. Parents of England, let me tell it you, and enlist your sympathies on behalf of oppressed and outraged humanity. It was that of a father helping up, by the hand, _his own little girl to be exposed for sale_. \"Now, who bids for this family? Title good--guaranteed free from the vices and maladies provided against by law. The man is an excellent shoemaker--can turn his hand to anything,--and his wife is a very good house-servant. Who bids for the lot? 500 dollars bid for them--600 dollars--only 600 dollars--700 dollars offered for them.\" But the price ultimately mounted up to 1,125 dollars.--\"Going for 1,125 dollars--once--twice--gone for 1,125 dollars.\"  The next was a black boy, 16 years of age. He mounted the chair, not the platform. \"Now, gentlemen, here is an excellent ploughboy. Who bids for him? Thank you,--400 dollars bid for him--425,\" and so on to 550 dollars. \"Why, look at him; he is a powerful-limbed boy; he will make a very large strong man.\" He was knocked down at 625 dollars.  \"The next I have to put up, gentlemen, is a young piece of city goods--the girl Cornelia. She is 18 years of age, a good washer and ironer, but not a very good cook. She is well known in the city, and has always belonged to some of the best families.\" By this time Cornelia was standing upon the chair. \"Now, gentlemen, who bids for this girl? She is sold for no fault, but simply for want of money. Who bids for this excellent washer and ironer?\" At this moment one of the \"gentlemen,\" standing in front of her, deliberately took his walking-stick, and, with the point of it, lifted up her clothes as high as the knee. I afterwards saw this same man walking arm-in-arm with his white wife in the street. \"500 dollars offered for her--530 dollars.\" She went for 580.  Here let me state, once for all, that I took notes on the spot. Those around me no doubt thought I was deeply interested in the state of the slave-market, and wishful to convey the most accurate information to my slave-breeding and soul-driving correspondents at a distance. Had my real object and character been discovered, I gravely doubt whether I should have left that \"great\" and \"free\" city alive!  The next \"lot\" were Jim, his wife, and two children, one about three, and the other about two years of age,--all on the platform. They were said to be excellent cotton-field hands, title good, and so forth; but, somehow, there were no bidders.  A boy about ten years of age, a fine intelligent-looking little fellow, was now made to mount the chair. \"Now, who bids for Tom? an excellent house-boy, a 'smart' young lad; can wait well at table--title good--guaranteed free from all the vices and maladies provided against by law. Who bids for him?\" The bidding began, at 350 dollars, and ended at 425.  \"I have now to put up the boy Edmund, thirty-two years of age, an excellent cotton-field hand. Who bids for the boy Edmund?\" At this moment a gentleman, who, like most of those present, appeared to be a sort of speculator in slaves, stepped forward, and examined with his hands the boy's legs, especially about the ankles, just as I have seen horse-dealers do with those animals at fairs. There were, however, no bidders; and Edmund was put down again.  The next that mounted the chair was a shrewd-looking negro, about thirty-five years of age. \"Now, gentlemen, who bids for Tom? He is an excellent painter and glazier, and a good cook besides; title good; sold for no fault, except that his owner had hired him at 25 dollars a month, and Tom would not work. An excellent painter and glazier, and a"]]]
