Although the number of slaves in the Brazils is very great, there is nowhere such a thing as a slave-market.  The importation of them is publicly prohibited, yet thousands are smuggled in every year, and disposed of in some underhand manner, which every one knows, and every one employs.  It is true, that English ships are constantly cruising off the coasts of Brazil and Africa, but even if a slaver happen to fall into their hands, the poor blacks, I was told, were no more free than if they had come to the Brazils.  They are all transported to the English colonies, where, at the expiration of ten years, they are supposed to be set at liberty.  But during this period, their owners allow the greater number to die--of course, in the returns only--and the poor slaves remain slaves still; but I repeat that I only know this from hearsay.  After all, slaves are far from being as badly off as many Europeans imagine.  In the Brazils they are generally pretty well treated; they are not overworked, their food is good and nutritious, and the punishments are neither particularly frequent nor heavy.  The crime of running away is the only one which is visited with great rigour. Besides a severe beating, they have fetters placed round their neck and feet; these they have to wear for a considerable period. Another manner of punishment consists in making them wear a tin mask, which is fastened with a lock behind.  This is the mode of punishment adopted for those who drink, or are in the habit of eating earth or lime.  During my long stay in the Brazils, I only saw one negro who had got on a mask of this description.  I very much doubt whether, on the whole, the lot of these slaves is not less wretched than that of the peasants of Russia, Poland, or Egypt, who are _not_ called slaves.  I was one day very much amused at being asked to stand godmother to a negro, which I did, although I was not present at either baptism or confirmation.  There is a certain custom here, that when a slave has done anything for which he expects to be punished, he endeavours to fly to some friend of his owner, and obtain a note, asking for the remission of his punishment.  The writer of such a letter has the title of godfather bestowed on him, and it would be accounted an act of the greatest impoliteness not to grant the godfather's request.  In this way, I myself was fortunate enough to save a slave from punishment.   The town is tolerably well lighted, and the lighting is continued to a considerable distance, on all sides, beyond the town itself; this measure was introduced on account of the great number of blacks.  No slave dare be seen in the streets later than 9 o'clock in the evening, without having a pass from his master, certifying that he is going on business for him.  If a slave is ever caught without a pass, he is immediately conveyed to the House of Correction, where his head is shaved, and he himself obliged to remain until his master buys his freedom for four or five milreis.  (8s. 8d., or 10s. 10d.)  In consequence of this regulation, the streets may be traversed with safety at any hour of the night.  One of the most disagreeable things in Rio Janeiro is the total absence of sewers.  In a heavy shower, every street becomes a regular stream, which it is impossible to pass on foot; in order to traverse them, it is requisite to be carried over by negroes.  At such times, all intercourse generally ceases, the streets are deserted, parties are put off, and even the payment of bills of exchange deferred.  It is very seldom that people will hire a carriage, for it is an absurd custom here, to pay as much for a short drive, as if the carriage were required for the whole day; in both cases the charge is six milreis (13s.)  The carriages are half- covered ones, with seats for two, and are drawn by a pair of mules, on one of which the driver rides.  Carriages and horses like the English are very seldom to be met with.  As regards the arts and sciences, I may mention the Academy of Fine Arts, the Museum, Theatre, etc.  In the Academy of Fine Arts is something of everything, and not much of anything--a few figures and busts, most in plaster, a few architectural plans and pencil drawings, and a collection of very old oil paintings.  It really seemed to me as if some private picture gallery had been carefully weeded of all the rubbish in it, which had then been put here out of the way.  Most of the oil paintings are so injured, that it is scarcely possible to make out what they are intended to represent, which, after all, is no great loss.  The only thing respectable about them is their venerable antiquity.  A startling contrast is produced by the copies of them made by the students.  If the colours in the old pictures are faded, in the modern ones they blaze with a superfluity of vividness; red, yellow, green, etc., are there in all their force; such a thing as mixing, softening, or blending them, has evidently never been thought of.  Even at the present moment, I really am at a loss to determine whether the worthy students intended to found a new school for colouring, or whether they merely desired to make up in the copies for the damage time had done the originals.  There were as many blacks and mulattoes among the students as whites, but the number of them altogether was inconsiderable.  Music, especially singing and the pianoforte, is almost in a more degraded position than painting.  In every family the young ladies play and sing; but of tact, style, arrangement, time, etc., the innocent creatures have not the remotest idea, so that the easiest and most taking melodies are often not recognisable.  The sacred music is a shade better, although even the arrangements of the Imperial Chapel itself are susceptible of many improvements.  The military bands are certainly the best, and these are generally composed of negroes and mulattoes.  The exterior of the Opera-house does not promise anything very beautiful or astonishing, and the stranger is, consequently, much surprised to find, on entering, a large and magnificent house with a deep stage.  I should say it could contain more than 2,000 persons. There are four tiers of spacious boxes rising one above the other, the balustrades of which, formed of delicately-wrought iron trellis- work, give the theatre a very tasty appearance.  The pit is only for men.  I was present at a tolerably good representation, by an Italian company, of the opera of Lucrezia Borgia; the scenery and costumes are not amiss.  If, however, I was agreeably surprised by my visit to the theatre, I experienced quite a contrary feeling on going to the Museum.  In a land so richly and luxuriously endowed by Nature, I expected an equally rich and magnificent museum, and found a number of very fine rooms, it is true, which one day or other may be filled, but which at present are empty.  The collection of birds, which is the most complete of all, is really fine; that of the minerals is very defective; and those of the quadrupeds and insects poor in the extreme.  The objects which most excited my curiosity, were the heads of four savages, in excellent preservation; two of them belonged to the Malay, and two to the New Zealand tribes.  The latter especially I could not sufficiently contemplate, completely covered as they were with tattooing of the most beautiful and elegant design, and so well preserved that they seemed only to have just ceased to live.  During the period of my stay in Rio Janeiro, the rooms of the Museum were undergoing repairs, and a new classification of the different objects was also talked of.  In consequence of this, the building was not open to the public, and I have to thank the kindness of Herr Riedl, the director, for allowing me to view it.  He acted himself as my guide; and, like me, regretted that in a country where the formation of a rich museum would be so easy a task, so little had been done.  I likewise visited the studio of the sculptor Petrich, a native of Dresden, who came over at the unsolicited command of the court, to execute a statue of the emperor in Carrara marble.  The emperor is represented the size of life, in a standing position, and arrayed in his imperial robes, with the ermine cloak thrown over his shoulder. The head is strikingly like, and the whole figure worked out of the stone with great artistic skill.  I believe this statue was destined for some public building.   I was fortunate enough during my stay in Rio Janeiro to witness several different public festivals.  The first was on the 21st of September, in the Church of St. Cruz, on the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the patron saint of the country.  Early in the morning several hundred soldiers were drawn up before the church, with an excellent band, which played a number of lively airs.  Between ten and eleven, the military and civil officers began gradually to arrive, the subordinate ones, as I was told, coming first.  On their entrance into the church, a brownish-red silk cloak, which concealed the whole of the uniform, was presented to each.  Every time that another of a higher rank appeared, all those already in the church rose from their seats, and advancing towards the new comer as far as the church door, accompanied him respectfully to his place.  The emperor and his wife arrived the last of all.  The emperor is extremely young--not quite one and twenty--but six feet tall, and very corpulent; his features are those of the Hapsburg-Lothering family.  The empress, a Neapolitan princess, is small and slim, and forms a strange contrast when standing beside the athletic figure of her husband.  High mass, which was listened to with great reverence by every one, began immediately after the entrance of the court, and after this was concluded the imperial pair proceeded to their carriage, presenting the crowd, who were waiting in the church,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],["title","A Woman's Journey Round the World (#7)"],["body"," hands to kiss as they went along.  This mark of distinction was bestowed not only on the officers and officials of superior rank, but on every one who pressed forward to obtain it.  A second, and more brilliant festival occurred on the 19th of October; it was the emperor's birth-day, and was celebrated by high mass in the Imperial Chapel.  This chapel is situated near the Imperial Palace, to which it is connected by means of a covered gallery.  Besides the imperial family, all the general officers, as well as the first officials of the state, were present at the mass, but in full uniform, without the ugly silk cloaks.  Surrounding all was a row of Lancers (the body-guard).  It is impossible for any but an eye-witness to form an idea of the richness and profusion of the gold embroidery, the splendid epaulets, and beautifully set orders, etc., displayed on the occasion, and I hardly believe that anything approaching it could be seen at any European court.  During high mass, the foreign ambassadors, and the ladies and gentlemen admitted to court, assembled in the palace, where, on the emperor's return, every one was admitted to kiss his hand.  The ambassadors, however, took no part in this proceeding, but merely made a simple bow.  This edifying ceremony could easily be seen from the square, as the windows are very near the ground, and were also open.  On such occasions continual salutes are fired from the imperial ships, and sometimes from others in the harbour.  On the 2nd of November I saw a festival of another description-- namely, a religious one.  During this and the following days, old and young proceed from one church to another, to pray for the souls of the departed.  They have a singular custom here of not burying all their dead in the church-yard, many bodies being placed, at an additional expense, in the church itself.  For this purpose, there are, in every church, particular chambers, with catacombs formed in the walls.  The corpse is strewed with lime, and laid in a catacomb of this description, where, after a lapse of eight or ten months, the flesh is completely eaten away.  The bones are then taken out, cleaned by boiling, and collected in an urn, on which is engraved the name, birth-day, etc., of the deceased.  These urns are afterwards set up in the passages of the church, or sometimes even taken home by the relations.  On All-souls' day, the walls of the chambers are hung with black cloth, gold lace, and other ornaments, and the urns are richly decorated with flowers and ribbons, and are lighted up by a great number of tapers in silver candelabra and chandeliers, placed upon high stands.  From an early hour in the morning until noon, the women and young girls begin praying very fervently for the souls of their deceased relations, and the young gentlemen, who are quite as curious as those in Europe, go to see the young girls pray.  Females on this day are dressed in mourning, and often wear, to the great disgust of the curious young gentlemen before mentioned, a black veil over their head and face.  No one, by the way, is allowed to wear a bonnet at any festival of the church.  But the most brilliant of the public festivals I saw here, was the christening of the imperial princess, which took place on the 15th of November, in the Imperial Chapel, which is connected with the palace.  Towards 3 o'clock in the afternoon a number of troops were drawn up in the court-yard of the palace, the guards were distributed in the corridors and the church, while the bands played a series of pleasing melodies, frequently repeating the National Anthem, which the late emperor, Peter I., is said to have composed.  Equipage after equipage began to roll up to the palace, and set down the most brilliantly attired company of both sexes.  At 4 o'clock the procession began to leave the palace.  First, came the court band, clothed in red velvet, and followed by three heralds, in old Spanish costume, magnificently decorated hats and feathers, and black velvet suits.  Next walked the officers of the law, and the authorities of every rank, chamberlains, court physicians, senators, deputies, generals, and ecclesiastics, privy councillors and secretaries; and, lastly, after this long line of different personages, came the lord steward of the young princess, whom he bore upon a magnificent white velvet cushion, edged with gold lace.  Immediately behind him followed the emperor, and the little princess's nurse, surrounded by the principal nobles and ladies of the court.  On passing through the triumphal arch of the gallery, and coming before the pallium of the church, the emperor took his little daughter {23a} into his own arms, and presented her to the people; an act which pleased me exceedingly, and which I considered extremely appropriate.  The empress, with her ladies, had likewise already arrived in the church through the inner corridors, and the ceremony commenced forthwith.  The instant the princess was baptized, the event was announced to the whole town by salvos of artillery, volleys of musketry, and the discharge of rockets. {23b}  At the conclusion of the ceremony, which lasted above an hour, the procession returned in the same order in which it had arrived, and the chapel was then opened to the people.  I was curious enough to enter with the rest, and, I must own, I was quite surprised at the magnificence and taste with which the building was decorated.  The walls were covered with silk and velvet hangings, ornamented with gold fringe, while rich carpets were spread underfoot.  On large tables, in the middle of the nave, were displayed the most valuable specimens of the church plate, gold and silver vases, immense dishes, plates, and goblets, artistically engraved, and ornamented with embossed or open work; while magnificent vessels of crystal, containing the most beautiful flowers, and massive candelabra, with innumerable lights, sparkled in the midst.  On a separate table, near the high altar, were all the costly vessels and furniture which had been employed at the christening; and, in one of the side chapels, the princess's cradle, covered with white satin, and ornamented with gold lace.  In the evening, the town, or rather, the public buildings, were illuminated.  The proprietors of private houses are not required to light up; and they either avail themselves of their privilege, or at most, hang out a few lanterns--a fact which will be readily understood, when it is known that such illuminations last for six or eight days.  The public buildings, on the contrary, are covered from top to bottom with countless lamps, which look exactly like a sea of fire.  The most original and really amusing fetes to celebrate the christening of the princess, were those given on several evenings in some of the barracks:  even the emperor himself made his appearance there for a few moments on different occasions.  They were also the only fetes I saw here which were not mixed up with religious solemnities.  The sole actors in them were the soldiers themselves, of whom the handsomest and most active had previously been selected, and exercised in the various evolutions and dances.  The most brilliant of these fetes took place in the barracks of the Rua Barbone.  A semicircular and very tasty gallery was erected in the spacious court-yard, and in the middle of the gallery were busts of the imperial couple.  This gallery was set apart for the ladies invited, who made their appearance as if dressed for the most splendid ball:  at the entrance of the court-yard they were received by the officers, and conducted to their places.  Before the gallery stood the stage, and at each side of the latter were ranged rows of seats for the less fashionable females; beyond these seats was standing-room for the men.  At eight o'clock the band commenced playing, and shortly afterwards the representation began.  The soldiers appeared, dressed in various costumes, as Highlanders, Poles, Spaniards, etc.; nor was there any scarcity of danseuses, who, of course, were likewise private soldiers.  What pleased me most was, that both the dress and behaviour of the military young ladies were highly becoming.  I had expected at least some little exaggeration, or at best no very elegant spectacle; and was therefore greatly astonished, not only with the correctness of the dances and evolutions, but also with the perfect propriety with which the whole affair was conducted.  The last fete that I saw took place on the 2nd of December, in celebration of the emperor's birth-day.  After high mass, the different dignitaries again waited on the emperor, to offer their congratulations, and were admitted to the honour of kissing his hand, etc.  The imperial couple then placed themselves at a window of the palace, while the troops defiled before them, with their bands playing the most lively airs.  It would be difficult to find better dressed soldiers than those here:  every private might easily be mistaken for a lieutenant, or at least a non-commissioned officer; but unluckily, their bearing, size, and colour, are greatly out of keeping with the splendour of their uniform--a mere boy of fourteen standing next to a full-grown, well-made man, a white coming after a black, and so on.  The men are pressed into the service; the time of serving is from four to six years.   I had heard and read a great deal in Europe of the natural magnificence and luxury of the Brazils--of the ever clear and smiling sky, and the extraordinary charm of the continual spring; but though it is true that the vegetation is perhaps richer, and the fruitfulness of the soil more luxuriant and vigorous than in any other part of the world, and that every one who desires to see the working of nature in its greatest force and incessant activity, must come to Brazil; still it must not be thought that all is good and beautiful, and that there is nothing which will not weaken the magical effect of the first"]]]
