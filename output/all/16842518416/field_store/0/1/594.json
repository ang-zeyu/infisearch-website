It was like the beating of wings.\" Frontispiece  \"I told you the place was uncanny.\"  Instinctively they all knelt down.  Carried with them an inalienable joy and possession into the great world.      A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY    Three men who had gained great fame and honour throughout the world met unexpectedly in front of the bookstall at Paddington Station. Like most of the great ones of the earth they were personally acquainted, and they exchanged surprised greetings.  Sir Angus McCurdie, the eminent physicist, scowled at the two others beneath his heavy black eyebrows.  \"I'm going to a God-forsaken place in Cornwall called Trehenna,\" said he.  \"That's odd; so am I,\" croaked Professor Biggleswade. He was a little, untidy man with round spectacles, a fringe of greyish beard and a weak, rasping voice, and he knew more of Assyriology than any man, living or dead. A flippant pupil once remarked that the Professor's face was furnished with a Babylonic cuneiform in lieu of features.  \"People called Deverill, at Foulis Castle?\" asked Sir Angus.  \"Yes,\" replied Professor Biggleswade.  \"How curious! I am going to the Deverills, too,\" said the third man.  This man was the Right Honourable Viscount Doyne, the renowned Empire Builder and Administrator, around whose solitary and remote life popular imagination had woven many legends. He looked at the world through tired grey eyes, and the heavy, drooping, blonde moustache seemed tired, too, and had dragged down the tired face into deep furrows. He was smoking a long black cigar.  \"I suppose we may as well travel down together,\" said Sir Angus, not very cordially.  Lord Doyne said courteously: \"I have a reserved carriage. The railway company is always good enough to place one at my disposal. It would give me great pleasure if you would share it.\"  The invitation was accepted, and the three men crossed the busy, crowded platform to take their seats in the great express train. A porter, laden with an incredible load of paraphernalia, trying to make his way through the press, happened to jostle Sir Angus McCurdie. He rubbed his shoulder fretfully.  \"Why the whole land should be turned into a bear garden on account of this exploded superstition of Christmas is one of the anomalies of modern civilization. Look at this insensate welter of fools travelling in wild herds to disgusting places merely because it's Christmas!\"  \"You seem to be travelling yourself, McCurdie,\" said Lord Doyne.  \"Yes--and why the devil I'm doing it, I've not the faintest notion,\" replied Sir Angus.  \"It's going to be a beast of a journey,\" he remarked some moments later, as the train carried them slowly out of the station. \"The whole country is under snow--and as far as I can understand we have to change twice and wind up with a twenty-mile motor drive.\"  He was an iron-faced, beetle-browed, stern man, and this morning he did not seem to be in the best of tempers. Finding his companions inclined to be sympathetic, he continued his lamentation.  \"And merely because it's Christmas I've had to shut up my laboratory and give my young fools a holiday--just when I was in the midst of a most important series of experiments.\"  Professor Biggleswade, who had heard vaguely of and rather looked down upon such new-fangled toys as radium and thorium and helium and argon--for the latest astonishing developments in the theory of radio-activity had brought Sir Angus McCurdie his world-wide fame--said somewhat ironically:  \"If the experiments were so important, why didn't you lock yourself up with your test tubes and electric batteries and finish them alone?\"  \"Man!\" said McCurdie, bending across the carriage, and speaking with a curious intensity of voice, \"d'ye know I'd give a hundred pounds to be able to answer that question?\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the Professor, startled.  \"I should like to know why I'm sitting in this damned train and going to visit a couple of addle-headed society people whom I'm scarcely acquainted with, when I might be at home in my own good company furthering the progress of science.\"  \"I myself,\" said the Professor, \"am not acquainted with them at all.\"  It was Sir Angus McCurdie's turn to look surprised.  \"Then why are you spending Christmas with them?\"  \"I reviewed a ridiculous blank-verse tragedy written by Deverill on the Death of Sennacherib. Historically it was puerile. I said so in no measured terms. He wrote a letter claiming to be a poet and not an archæologist. I replied that the day had passed when poets could with impunity commit the abominable crime of distorting history. He retorted with some futile argument, and we went on exchanging letters, until his invitation and my acceptance concluded the correspondence.\"  McCurdie, still bending his black brows on him, asked him why he had not declined. The Professor screwed up his face till it looked more like a cuneiform than ever. He, too, found the question difficult to answer, but he showed a bold front.  \"I felt it my duty,\" said he, \"to teach that preposterous ignoramus something worth knowing about Sennacherib. Besides I am a bachelor and would sooner spend Christmas, as to whose irritating and meaningless annoyance I cordially agree with you, among strangers than among my married sisters' numerous and nerve-racking families.\"  Sir Angus McCurdie, the hard, metallic apostle of radio-activity, glanced for a moment out of the window at the grey, frost-bitten fields. Then he said:  \"I'm a widower. My wife died many years ago and, thank God, we had no children. I generally spend Christmas alone.\"  He looked out of the window again. Professor Biggleswade suddenly remembered the popular story of the great scientist's antecedents, and reflected that as McCurdie had once run, a barefoot urchin, through the Glasgow mud, he was likely to have little kith or kin. He himself envied McCurdie. He was always praying to be delivered from his sisters and nephews and nieces, whose embarrassing demands no calculated coldness could repress.  \"Children are the root of all evil,\" said he. \"Happy the man who has his quiver empty.\"  Sir Angus McCurdie did not reply at once; when he spoke again it was with reference to their prospective host.  \"I met Deverill,\" said he, \"at the Royal Society's Soirée this year. One of my assistants was demonstrating a peculiar property of thorium and Deverill seemed interested. I asked him to come to my laboratory the next day, and found he didn't know a damned thing about anything. That's all the acquaintance I have with him.\"  Lord Doyne, the great administrator, who had been wearily turning over the pages of an illustrated weekly chiefly filled with flamboyant photographs of obscure actresses, took his gold glasses from his nose and the black cigar from his lips, and addressed his companions.  \"I've been considerably interested in your conversation,\" said he, \"and as you've been frank, I'll be frank too. I knew Mrs. Deverill's mother, Lady Carstairs, very well years ago, and of course Mrs. Deverill when she was a child. Deverill I came across once in Egypt--he had been sent on a diplomatic mission to Teheran. As for our being invited on such slight acquaintance, little Mrs. Deverill has the reputation of being the only really successful celebrity hunter in England. She inherited the faculty from her mother, who entertained the whole world. We're sure to find archbishops, and eminent actors, and illustrious divorcées asked to meet us. That's one thing. But why I, who loathe country house parties and children and Christmas as much as Biggleswade, am going down there to-day, I can no more explain than you can. It's a devilish odd coincidence.\"  The three men looked at one another. Suddenly McCurdie shivered and drew his fur coat around him.  \"I'll thank you,\" said he, \"to shut that window.\"  \"It is shut,\" said Doyne.  \"It's just uncanny,\" said McCurdie, looking from one to the other.  \"What?\" asked Doyne.  \"Nothing, if you didn't feel it.\"  \"There did seem to be a sudden draught,\" said Professor Biggleswade. \"But as both window and door are shut, it could only be imaginary.\"  \"It wasn't imaginary,\" muttered McCurdie.  Then he laughed harshly. \"My father and mother came from Cromarty,\" he said with apparent irrelevance.  \"That's the Highlands,\" said the Professor.  \"Ay,\" said McCurdie.  Lord Doyne said nothing, but tugged at his moustache and looked out of the window as the frozen meadows and bits of river and willows raced past. A dead silence fell on them. McCurdie broke it with another laugh and took a whiskey flask from his hand-bag.  \"Have a nip?\"  \"Thanks, no,\" said the Professor. \"I have to keep to a strict dietary, and I only drink hot milk and water--and of that sparingly. I have some in a thermos bottle.\"  Lord Doyne also declining the whiskey, McCurdie swallowed a dram and declared himself to be better. The Professor took from his bag a foreign review in which a German sciolist had dared to question his interpretation of a Hittite inscription. Over the man's ineptitude he fell asleep and snored loudly.  To escape from his immediate neighbourhood McCurdie went to the other end of the seat and faced Lord Doyne, who had resumed his gold glasses and his listless contemplation of obscure actresses. McCurdie lit a pipe, Doyne another black cigar. The train thundered on.  Presently they all lunched together in the restaurant car. The windows steamed, but here "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10707"],["title","A Christmas Mystery: The Story of Three Wise Men (#1)"],["body","there through a wiped patch of pane a white world was revealed. The snow was falling. As they passed through Westbury, McCurdie looked mechanically for the famous white horse carved into the chalk of the down; but it was not visible beneath the thick covering of snow.  \"It'll be just like this all the way to Gehenna--Trehenna, I mean,\" said McCurdie.  Doyne nodded. He had done his life's work amid all extreme fiercenesses of heat and cold, in burning droughts, in simoons and in icy wildernesses, and a ray or two more of the pale sun or a flake or two more of the gentle snow of England mattered to him but little. But Biggleswade rubbed the pane with his table-napkin and gazed apprehensively at the prospect.  \"If only this wretched train would stop,\" said he, \"I would go back again.\"  And he thought how comfortable it would be to sneak home again to his books and thus elude not only the Deverills, but the Christmas jollities of his sisters' families, who would think him miles away. But the train was timed not to stop till Plymouth, two hundred and thirty-five miles from London, and thither was he being relentlessly carried. Then he quarrelled with his food, which brought a certain consolation.         *       *       *       *       *  The train did stop, however, before Plymouth--indeed, before Exeter. An accident on the line had dislocated the traffic. The express was held up for an hour, and when it was permitted to proceed, instead of thundering on, it went cautiously, subject to continual stoppings. It arrived at Plymouth two hours late. The travellers learned that they had missed the connection on which they had counted and that they could not reach Trehenna till nearly ten o'clock. After weary waiting at Plymouth they took their seats in the little, cold local train that was to carry them another stage on their journey. Hot-water cans put in at Plymouth mitigated to some extent the iciness of the compartment. But that only lasted a comparatively short time, for soon they were set down at a desolate, shelterless wayside junction, dumped in the midst of a hilly snow-covered waste, where they went through another weary wait for another dismal local train that was to carry them to Trehenna. And in this train there were no hot-water cans, so that the compartment was as cold as death. McCurdie fretted and shook his fist in the direction of Trehenna.  \"And when we get there we have still a twenty miles' motor drive to Foullis Castle. It's a fool name and we're fools to be going there.\"  \"I shall die of bronchitis,\" wailed Professor Biggleswade.  \"A man dies when it is appointed for him to die,\" said Lord Doyne, in his tired way; and he went on smoking long black cigars.  \"It's not the dying that worries me,\" said McCurdie. \"That's a mere mechanical process which every organic being from a king to a cauliflower has to pass through. It's the being forced against my will and my reason to come on this accursed journey, which something tells me will become more and more accursed as we go on, that is driving me to distraction.\"  \"What will be, will be,\" said Doyne.  \"I can't see where the comfort of that reflection comes in,\" said Biggleswade.  \"And yet you've travelled in the East,\" said Doyne. \"I suppose you know the Valley of the Tigris as well as any man living.\"  \"Yes,\" said the Professor. \"I can say I dug my way from Tekrit to Bagdad and left not a stone unexamined.\"  \"Perhaps, after all,\" Doyne remarked, \"that's not quite the way to know the East.\"  \"I never wanted to know the modern East,\" returned the Professor. \"What is there in it of interest compared with the mighty civilizations that have gone before?\"  McCurdie took a pull from his flask.  \"I'm glad I thought of having a refill at Plymouth,\" said he.  At last, after many stops at little lonely stations they arrived at Trehenna. The guard opened the door and they stepped out on to the snow-covered platform. An oil lamp hung from the tiny pent-house roof that, structurally, was Trehenna Station. They looked around at the silent gloom of white undulating moorland, and it seemed a place where no man lived and only ghosts could have a bleak and unsheltered being. A porter came up and helped the guard with the luggage. Then they realized that the station was built on a small embankment, for, looking over the railing, they saw below the two great lamps of a motor car. A fur-clad chauffeur met them at the bottom of the stairs. He clapped his hands together and informed them cheerily that he had been waiting for four hours. It was the bitterest winter in these parts within the memory of man, said he, and he himself had not seen snow there for five years. Then he settled the three travellers in the great roomy touring car covered with a Cape-cart hood, wrapped them up in many rugs and started.  After a few moments, the huddling together of their bodies--for, the Professor being a spare man, there was room for them all on the back seat--the pile of rugs, the serviceable and all but air-tight hood, induced a pleasant warmth and a pleasant drowsiness. Where they were being driven they knew not. The perfectly upholstered seat eased their limbs, the easy swinging motion of the car soothed their spirits. They felt that already they had reached the luxuriously appointed home which, after all, they knew awaited them. McCurdie no longer railed, Professor Biggleswade forgot the dangers of bronchitis, and Lord Doyne twisted the stump of a black cigar between his lips without any desire to relight it. A tiny electric lamp inside the hood made the darkness of the world to right and left and in front of the talc windows still darker. McCurdie and Biggleswade fell into a doze. Lord Doyne chewed the end of his cigar. The car sped on through an unseen wilderness.  Suddenly there was a horrid jolt and a lurch and a leap and a rebound, and then the car stood still, quivering like a ship that has been struck by a heavy sea. The three men were pitched and tossed and thrown sprawling over one another onto the bottom of the car. Biggleswade screamed. McCurdie cursed. Doyne scrambled from the confusion of rugs and limbs and, tearing open the side of the Cape-cart hood, jumped out. The chauffeur had also just leaped from his seat. It was pitch dark save for the great shaft of light down the snowy road cast by the acetylene lamps. The snow had ceased falling.  \"What's gone wrong?\"  \"It sounds like the axle,\" said the chauffeur ruefully.  He unshipped a lamp and examined the car, which had wedged itself against a great drift of snow on the off side. Meanwhile McCurdie and Biggleswade had alighted.  \"Yes, it's the axle,\" said the chauffeur.  \"Then we're done,\" remarked Doyne.  \"I'm afraid so, my lord.\"  \"What's the matter? Can't we get on?\" asked Biggleswade in his querulous voice.  McCurdie laughed. \"How can we get on with a broken axle? The thing's as useless as a man with a broken back. Gad, I was right. I said it was going to be an infernal journey.\"  The little Professor wrung his hands. \"But what's to be done?\" he cried.  \"Tramp it,\" said Lord Doyne, lighting a fresh cigar.  \"It's ten miles,\" said the chauffeur.  \"It would be the death of me,\" the Professor wailed.  \"I utterly refuse to walk ten miles through a Polar waste with a gouty foot,\" McCurdie declared wrathfully.  The chauffeur offered a solution of the difficulty. He would set out alone for Foullis Castle--five miles farther on was an inn where he could obtain a horse and trap--and would return for the three gentlemen with another car. In the meanwhile they could take shelter in a little house which they had just passed, some half mile up the road. This was agreed to. The chauffeur went on cheerily enough with a lamp, and the three travellers with another lamp started off in the opposite direction. As far as they could see they were in a long, desolate valley, a sort of No Man's Land, deathly silent. The eastern sky had cleared somewhat, and they faced a loose rack through which one pale star was dimly visible.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm a man of science,\" said McCurdie as they trudged through the snow, \"and I dismiss the supernatural as contrary to reason; but I have Highland blood in my veins that plays me exasperating tricks. My reason tells me that this place is only a commonplace moor, yet it seems like a Valley of Bones haunted by malignant spirits who have lured us here to our destruction. There's something guiding us now. It's just uncanny.\"  \"Why on earth did we ever come?\" croaked Biggleswade.  Lord Doyne answered: \"The Koran says, 'Nothing can befall us but what God hath destined for us.' So why worry?\"  \"Because I'm not a Mohammedan,\" retorted Biggleswade.  \"You might be worse,\" said Doyne.  Presently the dim outline of the little house grew perceptible. A faint light shone from the window. It stood unfenced by any kind of hedge or railing a few feet away from the road in a little hollow beneath some rising ground. As far as they could discern in the darkness when they drew near, the house was a mean, dilapidated hovel. A guttering candle stood on the inner sill of the small window and afforded a vague view into a mean interior. Doyne held up the lamp so that its rays fell full on the door. As he did so, an exclamation broke from his lips and he hurried forward, followed by the others. A man's body lay huddled together on the snow by the threshold. He was dressed like a peasant, in old corduroy trousers and rough coat, and a handkerchief was knotted round his neck. In his hand he grasped the neck of a broken bottle. Doyne set the lamp on the ground and the three bent down together over the man. Close by the neck lay the rest of the broken bottle, whose contents had evidently run out into the snow.  \"Drunk?\" asked Biggleswade.  Doyne felt the man and laid his hand on his heart.  \"No,\" said he, \"dead.\"  McCurdie leaped to his full height. \"I told you the place was uncanny!\" he cried. \"It's "]]]
