He rushed impetuously at Andy, but he was blinded by his own impetuosity, and his adversary, who kept cool and self-possessed, had, of course, the advantage. So the engagement terminated as before--Godfrey was stretched once more on the sidewalk. He was about to renew the assault, however, when there was an interruption. This interruption came in the form of Colonel Preston himself, who was returning from a business meeting of citizens interested in establishing a savings bank in the village.  \"What's all this, Godfrey?\" he called out, in a commanding tone.  Godfrey knew that when his father spoke he must obey, and he therefore desisted from the contemplated attack. He looked up at his father and said, sulkily:  \"I was punishing this Irish boy for his impertinence.\"  John grinned a little at this way of putting it, and his father said:  \"It looked very much as if he were punishing you.\"  \"I didn't get fair hold,\" said Godfrey, sulkily.  \"So he was impertinent, was he? What did he say?\"  \"He said I was no gentleman.\"  Andy Burke listened attentively to what was said, but didn't attempt to justify himself as yet.  \"I have sometimes had suspicions of that myself,\" said his father, quietly.  Though Godfrey was an only son, his father was sensible enough to be fully aware of his faults. If he was indulged, it was his mother, not his father, that was in fault. Colonel Preston was a fair and just man, and had sensible views about home discipline; but he was overruled by his wife, whose character may be judged from the fact that her son closely resembled her. She was vain, haughty, and proud of putting on airs. She considered herself quite the finest lady in the village, but condescended to associate with the wives of the minister, the doctor, and a few of the richer inhabitants, but even with them she took care to show that she regarded herself superior to them all. She was, therefore, unpopular, as was her son among his companions. However, these two stood by each other, and Mrs. Preston was sure to defend Godfrey in all he did, and complained because his father did not do the same.  \"I didn't think you'd turn against me, and let a low boy insult me,\" complained Godfrey.  \"Why do you call him low?\"  \"Because he's only an Irish boy.\"  \"Some of our most distinguished men have been Irish boys or of Irish descent. I don't think you have proved your point.\"  \"He's a beggar.\"  \"I'm not a beggar,\" exclaimed Andy, speaking for the first time. \"I never begged a penny in all my life.\"  \"Look at his rags,\" said Godfrey, scornfully.  \"You would be in rags, too, if you had to buy your own clothes. I think I should respect you very much more under the circumstances,\" returned his father.  \"The colonel's a-givin' it to him,\" thought John, with a grin. \"'Twon't do the young master any harm.\"  \"What is your name?\" inquired Colonel Preston, turning now to our hero, as his son seemed to have no more to say.  \"Andy Burke.\"  \"Do you live here?\"  \"I've just come to town, sir. My mother lives here.\"  \"Where does she live?\"  \"I don't know, sir, just. He knows,\" pointing out John.  \"I calcerlate his mother lives in old Jake Barlow's house,\" said John.  \"Oh, the Widow Burke. Yes, I know. I believe Mrs. Preston employs her sometimes. Well, Andy, if that's your name, how is it that I catch you fighting with my son? That is not very creditable, unless you have good cause.\"  \"He called my mother a low woman,\" said Andy, \"and then he run up and hit me.\"  \"Did you do that, Godfrey?\"  \"He was putting on too many airs. He talked as if he was my equal.\"  \"He appears to be more than your equal in strength,\" said his father. \"Well, was that all?\"  \"It was about all.\"  \"Then I think he did perfectly right, and I hope you'll profit by the lesson you have received.\"  \"He is a gentleman,\" thought Andy. \"He ain't hard on a boy because he's poor.\"  Colonel Preston went into the house, but Godfrey lingered behind a moment. He wanted to have a parting shot at his adversary. He could fight with words, if not with blows.  \"Look here!\" he said, imperiously; \"don't let me see you round here again.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I don't want to see you.\"  \"Then you can look the other way,\" said Andy, independently.  \"This is my house.\"  \"I thought it was your father's.\"  \"That's the same thing. You'd better stay at home with your mother.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Andy; \"you're very kind. May I come along the road sometimes?\"  \"If you do, walk on the other side.\"  Andy laughed. He was no longer provoked, but amused.  \"Then, by the same token, you'd better not come by my mother's house,\" he said, good-humoredly.  \"I don't want to come near your miserable shanty,\" said Godfrey, disdainfully.  \"You may come, if you keep on the other side of the road,\" said Andy, slyly.  Godfrey was getting disgusted; for in the war of words, as well as of blows, his ragged opponent seemed to be getting the better of him. He turned on his heel and entered the house. He was sure of one who would sympathize with him in his dislike and contempt for Andy--this was, of course, his mother. Besides, he had another idea. He knew that Mrs. Burke had been employed by his mother, occasionally, to assist in the house. It occurred to him that it would be a fine piece of revenge to induce her to dispense hereafter with the poor woman's services. Bent on accomplishing this creditable retaliation, he left his young opponent master of the field.  \"I must be goin',\" said Andy, as he picked up his bundle and suspended it from his stick. \"Will I find the house where my mother lives, easy?\"  The question was, of course, addressed to John, who had just turned to go to the stable.  \"You can't miss it,\" answered John. \"It's a mile up the road, stands a little way back. There's a few hills of potatoes in the front yard. How long since you saw your mother?\"  \"It's three months.\"  \"Does she know you are coming to-day?\"  \"No. I would have wrote to her, but my fingers isn't very ready with the pen.\"  \"Nor mine either,\" said John. \"I'd rather take a licking any time than write a letter. Come round and see us some time.\"  \"The boy'll lick me,\" said Andy, laughing.  \"I guess you can manage him.\"  Andy smiled, for it was his own conviction, also. With his bundle on his shoulder he trudged on, light of heart, for he was about to see his mother and sister, both of whom he warmly loved.     CHAPTER III ANDY AND HIS MOTHER   The house in which the Widow Burke and her daughter lived was a very humble one. It had not been painted for many years, and the original coat had worn off, leaving it dark and time-stained. But when Mrs. Burke came to town, a short time before, it was the only dwelling she could hire that was held at a rent within her means. So she and Mary, who was now eleven years old, had moved in their scanty furniture and made it look as much like a home as possible.  Mrs. Burke had not always been as poor as now. She was the daughter of an Irish tradesman, and had received quite a good education. In due time she married a small farmer, who was considered to be in fair circumstances, but there came a bad year, and misfortunes of various kinds came together. The last and heaviest of all was fever, which prostrated her husband on a bed of sickness. Though his wife watched over him night and day with all the devotion of love, it was all of no avail. He died, and she found herself left with about a hundred pounds--after his debts were paid. She was advised to go to America with her two children, and did so. That was five years before. They had lived in various places--but the little sum she had left over, after the passage of the three was paid, had long since melted away, and she was forced to get a living as she could.  Since she had come to Crampton, leaving Andy at work for a farmer in the place where they had last lived, she had obtained what sewing she could from the families in the village, and had besides obtained a chance to help about the ironing at Colonel Preston's. Washing was too hard for her, for her strength was not great.  At the time of our introduction she was engaged in making a shirt, one of half a dozen which she had engaged to make for Dr. Plympton, the village doctor. She had no idea that Andy was so near, having heard nothing of his having left his place, but it was of him she was speaking.  \"I wish I could see Andy,\" she sighed, looking up from her work.  \"So do I, mother.\"  \"The sight of him would do my eyes good, he's such a lively lad, Andy is--always in good spirits.\"  \"Shure, he's got a good heart, mother dear. It wouldn't be so lonely like if he was here.\"  \"I would send for him if there was anything to do, Mary; but we are so poor that we must all of us stay where we can get work.\"  \"When do you go to Colonel Preston's, mother? Is it to-morrow?\"  \"Yes, my dear.\"  \"I'm always lonely when you are away.\"  \"Perhaps you would come with me, Mary, dear. Mrs. Preston wouldn't object, I'm thinkin'.\"  \"If Andy was at home I wouldn't feel so lonely.\"  While she was speaking Andy himself had crept under the window, and heard her words. He was planning a surprise, but waited for the last moment to announce himself. He waited to hear what reply his mother would say.  \"I think we'll see him soon, Mary, dear.\"  \"What makes you say so, mother?\"  \"I don't know. I've got a feeling in my bones that we'll soon meet. The blessed saints grant that it may be so.\"  \"Your bones are right this time, mother,\" said a merry voice.  And Andy, popping up from his stooping position, showed himself at the window.  There was a simultaneous scream from Mary and her mother.  \"Is it you, Andy?\" exclaimed Mary.  \"It isn't nobody else,\" said Andy, rather ungrammatically.  \"Come in, Andy, my darling--come in, and tell me if you are well,\" said his mother, dropping the shirt on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11111"],["title","Only an Irish Boy; Or, Andy Burke's Fortunes (#2)"],["body","she was at work, and rising to her feet.  \"I'll be with you in a jiffy,\" said Andy.  And, with a light leap, he cleared the window sill, and stood in the presence of his mother and sister, who vied with each other in hugging the returned prodigal.  \"You'll choke me, Sister Mary,\" said Andy, good-humoredly. \"Maybe you think I'm your beau.\"  \"Don't speak to her of beaux, and she only eleven years old,\" said his mother. \"But you haven't told us why you came.\"  \"Faith, mother, it was because the work gave out, and I thought I'd pack my trunk and come and see you and Mary. That's all.\"  \"We are glad to see you, Andy, dear, but,\" continued his mother, taking a survey of her son's appearance for the first time, \"you're lookin' like a beggar, with your clothes all in rags.\"  Andy laughed.  \"Faith, it's about so, mother. There was no one to mend 'em for me, and I'm more used to the hoe than the needle.\"  \"I will sew up some of the holes when you're gone to bed, Andy. Are you sure you're well, lad?\"  \"Well, mother? Jist wait till you see me atin', mother. You'll think I've got a healthy appetite.\"  \"I never thought, Andy. The poor lad must be hungry. Mary, see what there is in the closet.\"  \"There's nothing but some bread, mother,\" said Mary.  Indeed bread and potatoes were the main living of the mother and daughter, adopted because they were cheap. They seldom ventured on the extravagance of meat, and that was one reason, doubtless, for Mrs. Burke's want of strength and sometimes feeling faint and dizzy while working at her needle.  \"Is there no meat in the house, Mary?\"  \"Not a bit, mother.\"  \"Then go and see if there's an egg outside.\"  The widow kept a few hens, having a henhouse in one corner of the back yard. The eggs she usually sold, but Andy was at home now, and needed something hearty, so they must be more extravagant than usual.  Mary went out, and quickly returned with a couple of eggs.  \"Here they are, mother, two of them. The black hen was settin' on them, but I drove her away, and you can hear her cackling. Shure, Andy needs them more than she does.\"  \"Will you have them boiled or fried, Andy?\" asked his mother.  \"Any way, mother. I'm hungry enough to ate 'em raw. It's hungry work walkin' ten miles wid a bundle on your back, let alone the fightin'.\"  \"Fighting!\" exclaimed Mrs. Burke, pausing in drawing out the table.  \"Fightin', Andy?\" chimed in Mary, in chorus.  \"Yes, mother,\" said Andy.  \"And who did you fight with?\" asked the widow, anxiously.  \"With a boy that feels as big as a king; maybe bigger.\"  \"What's his name?\"  \"I heard his father call him Godfrey.\"  \"What, Godfrey Preston?\" exclaimed Mrs. Burke in something like consternation.  \"Yes, that's the name. He lives in a big house a mile up the road.\"  \"What made you fight with him, Andy?\" inquired his mother, anxiously.  \"He began it.\"  \"What could he have against you? He didn't know you.\"  \"He thought as I only was an Irish boy he could insult me, and call me names, but I was too much for him.\"  \"I hope you didn't hurt him?\"  \"I throwed him twice, mother, but then his father came up and that put a stop to the fight.\"  \"And what did his father say?\"  \"He took my part, mother, when he found out how it was, and scolded his son. Shure, he's a gentleman.\"  \"Yes, Colonel Preston is a gentleman.\"  \"And that's where he isn't like his son, I'm thinkin'.\"  \"No. Godfrey isn't like his father. It's his mother he favors.\"  \"Faith, and I don't call it favoring,\" said Andy. Is the old lady as ugly and big-feelin' as the son?\"  \"She's rather a hard woman, Andy. I go up to work there one day every week.\"  \"Do you, mother?\" said Andy, not wholly pleased to hear that his mother was employed by the mother of his young enemy.  \"Yes, Andy.\"  \"What is it you do?\"  \"I help about the ironing. To-morrow's my day for going there.\"  \"I wish you could stay at home, and not go out to work, mother,\" said Andy, soberly. \"You don't look strong, mother, dear. I'm afraid you're not well.\"  \"Oh, yes, Andy, I am quite well. I shall be better, too, now that you are at home. I missed you very much. It seemed lonely without you.\"  \"I must find out some way to earn money, mother,\" said Andy. \"I'm young and strong, and I ought to support you.\"  \"You can help me, Andy,\" said Mrs. Burke, cheerfully.  She took up the shirt and resumed her sewing.  \"I'm afraid you're too steady at the work, mother,\" said Andy.  \"I shall be ironing to-morrow. It's a change from sewing, Andy. Mary, it's time to take off the eggs.\"  Andy was soon partaking of the frugal meal set before him. He enjoyed it, simple as it was, and left not a particle of the egg or a crumb of the bread.     CHAPTER IV MRS. PRESTON   Whenever Godfrey Preston had any difficulty with his father, he always went to his mother, and from her, right or wrong, he was sure to obtain sympathy. So in the present instance, failing to receive from his father that moral support to which he deemed himself entitled, on entering the house he sought out his mother.  Mrs. Preston, who was rather a spare lady, with thin lips and a sharp, hatchet-like face, was in her own room. She looked up as Godfrey entered.  \"Well, Godfrey, what's the matter?\" she asked, seeing on her son's face an unmistakable expression of discontent.  \"Matter enough, mother. Father's always against me.\"  \"I know it. He appears to forget that you are his son. What is it now?\"  \"He came up just as I was thrashing a boy down in the yard.\"  \"What boy?\"  \"Nobody you know, mother. It was only an Irish boy.\"  \"What was your reason for punishing him?\" asked Mrs. Preston, adopting Godfrey's version of the affair.  \"He was impudent to me. He was leaning against the fence, and I ordered him away. He was a ragged boy, with a bundle on a stick. Of course, when he wouldn't move, I went out and thrashed him.\"  \"Was your father there?\"  \"He came up in the midst of it, and, instead of taking my part, he took the part of the Irish boy.\"  \"I don't see how Mr. Preston can be so unfair,\" said his wife. \"It is his duty to stand by his family.\"  \"I felt ashamed to have him scold me before the impudent boy. Of course, he enjoyed it, and I suppose he will think he can be impudent to me again.\"  \"No doubt. I will speak to your father about it. He really shouldn't be so inconsiderate. But what is that stain on your coat, Godfrey? I should think you had been down on your back on the ground.\"  \"Oh,\" said Godfrey, rather embarrassed, \"I happened to slip as I was wrestling with the fellow, and fell on my back. However, I was up again directly and gave it to him, I can tell you. If father hadn't stopped me I'd have laid him out,\" he continued, in a swaggering tone.  It will be seen that Godfrey did not always confine himself to the truth. Indeed, he found it rather hard at all times to admit either that he had been in the wrong or had been worsted. Even if his mother sometimes suspected that his accounts were a trifle distorted, she forbore to question their accuracy. Mother and son had a sort of tacit compact by which they stood by each other, and made common cause against Colonel Preston.  \"Don't you know the boy? Doesn't he live in the neighborhood?\" asked Mrs. Preston, after a pause.  \"He's just come into the town, but I'll tell you who he is. He's the son of that woman that comes to work for you once a week.\"  \"Mrs. Burke?\"  \"Yes; he told me that his name was Andy Burke.\"  \"He ought to know his place too well to be impudent to one in your position.\"  \"So I think.\"  \"I shall speak to Mrs. Burke about her son's bad behavior.\"  \"I wish you'd discharge her. That's a good way to punish the boy.\"  \"I shouldn't object to doing that, Godfrey, but Mrs. Burke is a capital hand at ironing shirts. Yours and your father's never looked so nice as they have since she has been here.\"  Godfrey looked a little discontented. Being essentially mean, he thought it would be an excellent plan to strike the son through the mother.  \"You might threaten her, mother, a little. Tell her to make her boy behave himself, or you'll discharge her.\"  \"I will certainly speak to her on the subject, Godfrey.\"  At the table Mrs. Preston introduced the subject of Godfrey's wrongs.  \"I am surprised, Mr. Preston, that you took part against Godfrey when he was rudely assaulted this morning.\"  \"I thought Godfrey in the wrong, my dear. That was my reason.\"  \"You generally appear to think your own son in the wrong. You are ready to take part with any stranger against him,\" said Mrs. Preston, in a complaining manner.  \"I don't think you are quite right just there,\" said her husband, good-humoredly. \"I must say, however, that Godfrey generally is in the wrong.\"  \"You are very unjust to him.\"  \"I don't mean to be. I would be glad to praise him, but he is so overbearing to those whom he considers his inferiors, that I am frequently ashamed of his manner of treating others.\"  \"The boy has some reason to feel proud. He must maintain his position.\"  \"What is his position?\"  \"I don't think you need to ask. As our son he is entitled to a degree of consideration.\"  \"He will receive consideration enough if he deserves it, but this is a republic, and all are supposed to be on an equality.\"  Mrs. Preston tossed her head.  \"That's well enough to say, but don't you consider yourself above a man that goes round sawing wood for a living?\"  \"At any rate I would treat him with courtesy. Because I am richer, and have a better education, it is no reason why I should treat him with contempt.\"  \"Then I don't share your sentiments,\" said Mrs. Preston. \"I am thankful that I know my position better. I mean to uphold the dignity of the family, and I hope my son will do the same.\"  Colonel Preston shrugged his shoulders as his wife swept from the room. He knew of old her sentiments on this subject, and he was aware that she was not likely to become a convert to his more democratic ideas.  \"I am afraid she will spoil Godfrey,\" he thought. \"The boy is getting intolerable. I am "]]]
