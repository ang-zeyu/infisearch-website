I will fly as far                 As there is morning, ere I give distaste                 To that most honour'd mind.  But through these tears                 Shed at my hopeless parting, I can see                 A world of Treason practis'd upon you,                 And her and me. Farewel for evermore;                 If you shall hear, that sorrow struck me dead,                 And after find me Loyal, let there be                 A tear shed from you in my memorie,                 And I shall rest at peace.

Nature too unkind,                 That made no medicine for a troubled mind!                                                        [_Exit_. Phi.       _Enter_ Arethuse.  _Are_.       I marvel my boy comes not back again;                 But that I know my love will question him                 Over and over; how I slept, wak'd, talk'd;                 How I remembred him when his dear name                 Was last spoke, and how, when I sigh'd, wept, sung,                 And ten thousand such; I should be angry at his stay.                                     [_Enter _King.  _King_.    What are your meditations? who attends you?  _Are_.      None but my single self, I need no Guard,                 I do no wrong, nor fear none.  _King_.    Tell me: have you not a boy?  _Are_.      Yes Sir.  _King_.    What kind of boy?  _Are_.       A Page, a waiting boy.  _King_.     A handsome boy?  _Are_.       I think he be not ugly:                 Well qualified, and dutiful, I know him,                 I took him not for beauty.  _King_.    He speaks, and sings and plays?  _Are_.      Yes Sir.  _King_.    About Eighteen?  _Are_.      I never ask'd his age.  _King_.    Is he full of service?  _Are_.      By your pardon why do you ask?  _King_.    Put him away.  _Are_.      Sir?  _King_.    Put him away, h'as done you that good service,                 Shames me to speak of.  _Are_.      Good Sir let me understand you.  _King_.    If you fear me, shew it in duty; put away that boy.  _Are_.      Let me have reason for it Sir, and then                 Your will is my command.  _King_.    Do not you blush to ask it? Cast him off,                 Or I shall do the same to you. Y'are one                 Shame with me, and so near unto my self,                 That by my life, I dare not tell my self,                 What you, my self have done.  _Are_.      What have I done my Lord?  _King_.     'Tis a new language, that all love to learn,                 The common people speak it well already,                 They need no Grammer; understand me well,                 There be foul whispers stirring; cast him off!                 And suddenly do it: Farewel.                                                             [_Exit_ King.  _Are_.      Where may a Maiden live securely free,                 Keeping her Honour safe? Not with the living,                 They feed upon opinions, errours, dreams,                 And make 'em truths: they draw a nourishment                 Out of defamings, grow upon disgraces,                 And when they see a vertue fortified                 Strongly above the battery of their tongues;                 Oh, how they cast to sink it; and defeated                 (Soul sick with Poyson) strike the Monuments                 Where noble names lie sleeping: till they sweat,                 And the cold Marble melt.     _Enter_ Philaster.  _Phi_.       Peace to your fairest thoughts, dearest Mistress.  _Are_.      Oh, my dearest servant I have a War within me.  _Phi_.      He must be more than man, that makes these Crystals                 Run into Rivers; sweetest fair, the cause;                 And as I am your slave, tied to your goodness,                 Your creature made again from what I was,                 And newly spirited, I'le right your honours.  _Are_.      Oh, my best love; that boy!  _Phi_.      What boy?  _Are_.      The pretty boy you gave me.  _Phi_.      What of him?  _Are_.      Must be no more mine.  _Phi_.      Why?  _Are_.      They are jealous of him.  _Phi_.      Jealous, who?  _Are_.      The King.  _Phi_.      Oh, my fortune,                 Then 'tis no idle jealousie. Let him go.  _Are_.      Oh cruel, are you hard hearted too?                 Who shall now tell you, how much I lov'd you;                 Who shall swear it to you, and weep the tears I send?                 Who shall now bring you Letters, Rings, Bracelets,                 Lose his health in service? wake tedious nights                 In stories of your praise? Who shall sing                 Your crying Elegies? And strike a sad soul                 Into senseless Pictures, and make them mourn?                 Who shall take up his Lute, and touch it, till                 He crown a silent sleep upon my eye-lid,                 Making me dream and cry, Oh my dear, dear _Philaster_.  _Phi_.       Oh my heart!                 Would he had broken thee, that made thee know                 This Lady was not Loyal. Mistress, forget                 The boy, I'le get thee a far better.  _Are_.      Oh never, never such a boy again, as my _Bellario_.  _Phi_.       'Tis but your fond affection.  _Are_.      With thee my boy, farewel for ever,                 All secrecy in servants: farewel faith,                 And all desire to do well for it self:                 Let all that shall succeed thee, for thy wrongs,                 Sell and betray chast love.  _Phi_.      And all this passion for a boy?  _Are_.      He was your boy, and you put him to me,                 And the loss of such must have a mourning for.  _Phi_.      O thou forgetful woman!  _Are_.      How, my Lord?  _Phi_.       False _Arethusa_!                 Hast thou a Medicine to restore my wits,                 When I have lost 'em? If not, leave to talk, and do thus.  _Are_.       Do what Sir? would you sleep?  _Phi_.       For ever _Arethusa_. Oh you gods,                 Give me a worthy patience; Have I stood                 Naked, alone the shock of many fortunes?                 Have I seen mischiefs numberless, and mighty                 Grow li[k]e a sea upon me? Have I taken                 Danger as stern as death into my bosom,                 And laught upon it, made it but a mirth,                 And flung it by? Do I live now like him,                 Under this Tyrant King, that languishing                 Hears his sad Bell, and sees his Mourners? Do I                 Bear all this bravely, and must sink at length                 Under a womans falshood? Oh that boy,                 That cursed boy? None but a villain boy, to ease                 your lust?  _Are_.      Nay, then I am betray'd,                 I feel the plot cast for my overthrow; Oh I am wretched.  _Phi_.      Now you may take that little right I have                 To this poor Kingdom; give it to your Joy,                 For I have no joy in it. Some far place,                 Where never womankind durst set her foot,                 For bursting with her poisons, must I seek,                 And live to curse you;                 There dig a Cave, and preach to birds and beasts,                 What woman is, and help to save them from you.                 How heaven is in your eyes, but in your hearts,                 More hell than hell has; how your tongues like Scorpions,                 Both heal and poyson; how your thoughts are woven                 With thousand changes in one subtle webb,                 And worn so by you. How that foolish man,                 That reads the story of a womans face,                 And dies believing it, is lost for ever.                 How all the good you have, is but a shadow,                 I'th' morning with you, and at night behind you,                 Past and forgotten. How your vows are frosts,                 Fast for a night, and with the next sun gone.                 How you are, being taken all together,                 A meer confusion, and so dead a _Chaos_,                 That love cannot distinguish. These sad Texts                 Till my last hour, I am bound to utter of you.                 So farewel all my wo, all my delight.                                                             [_Exit_ Phi.  _Are_.      Be merciful ye gods and strike me dead;                 What way have I deserv'd this? make my breast                 Transparent as pure Crystal, that the world                 Jealous of me, may see the foulest thought                 My heart holds. Where shall a woman turn her eyes,                 To find out constancy? Save me, how black,                                                        [_Enter_ Bell.                  And guilty (me thinks) that boy looks now?                 Oh thou dissembler, that before thou spak'st                 Wert in thy cradle false? sent to make lies,                 And betray Innocents; thy Lord and thou,                 May glory in the ashes of a Maid                 Fool'd by her passion; but the conquest is                 Nothing so great as wicked.

HARDY ORNAMENTAL FLOWERING TREES AND SHRUBS.  By  A.D. WEBSTER,  _Author of \"Practical Forestry,\" \"Hardy Coniferous Trees,\" \"British Orchids,\" &c., &c._     1897.     PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION, 1893.  This book has been written and is published with the distinct object in view of bringing home to the minds of planters of Hardy Trees and Shrubs, the fact that the monotonous repetition, in at least nine-tenths of our Parks and Gardens, of such Trees as the Elm, the Lime, and the Oak, and such Shrubs as the Cherry Laurel and the Privet, is neither necessary nor desirable. There is quite a host of choice and beautiful flowering species, which, though at present not generally known are yet perfectly hardy, of the simplest culture, and equally well adapted for the ornamentation of our Public and Private Parks and Gardens.  Of late years, with the marked decline in the cultivation of Coniferous Trees, many of which are ill adapted for the climate of this country, the interest in our lovely flowering Trees and Shrubs has been greatly revived. This fact has been well exemplified in the numerous enquiries after these subjects, and the space devoted to their description and modes of cultivation in the Horticultural Press.  In the hope, too, of helping to establish a much-desired standard of nomenclature, I have followed the generic names adopted by the authors of _The Genera Plantarum_, and the specific names and orthography, as far as I have been able, of the _Index Kewensis_; and where possible I have given the synonyms, the date of introduction, and the native country. The alphabetical arrangement that has been adopted, both with regard to the genera and species, it is hoped, will greatly facilitate the work of reference to its pages. The descriptive notes and hints on cultivation, the selected lists of Trees and Shrubs for various special purposes, and the calendarial list which indicates the flowering season of the different species, may be considered all the more valuable for being concisely written, and made readily accessible by means of the Index.  No work written on a similar plan and treating solely of Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs has hitherto been published; and it is not supposed for a moment that the present one will entirely supply the deficiency; but should it meet with any measure of public approval, it may be the means of paving the way towards the publication of a more elaborate work--and one altogether more worthy of the interesting and beautiful Flowering Trees and Shrubs that have been found suitable for planting in the climate of the British Isles.  Of the fully thirteen hundred species and varieties of Trees and Shrubs enumerated, all may be depended upon as being hardy in some part of the country. Several of them, and particularly those introduced from China and Japan, have not before been included in a book of this character. Trials for the special purpose of testing the hardiness of the more tender kinds have been instituted and carried out in several favoured parts of England and Ireland.  A.D.W. HOLLYDALE, WOBURN.   PREFACE TO SECOND AND CHEAP EDITION, 1897.  The First Edition of Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs having been sold out, it has been considered desirable to run off a second and cheap edition on exactly similar lines to the first, and previous to the more elaborate illustrated edition which is now in hand.  A.D.W. BOXMOOR, HERTS, 1897.     HARDY ORNAMENTAL FLOWERING TREES & SHRUBS.   ABELIA.  ABELIA CHINENSIS (_syn A. rupestris_).--The Rock Abelia China, 1844. This is a neat, twiggy shrub, growing from 2 ft. to 3 ft. high, with slender shoots, and very pleasing, shining green serrated leaves. The tubular, sweet-scented flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of the shoots, even the smallest, and are of a very delicate shade of pink--indeed, almost white. It makes an excellent wall plant, but by no means refuses to grow and flower freely without either shelter or protection, provided a fairly rich and well drained soil is provided. From August to October is the flowering period of this handsome deciduous shrub. This is the only really hardy species of the genus, for though the rosy-purple flowered A. floribunda from Mexico has stood for several years uninjured in the South of England, it is not to be relied upon. Both species are readily propagated from cuttings.  A. TRIFLORA.--Himalayan regions, 1847. A half-hardy and beautiful species with small lanceolate, entire leaves, and pretty star-shaped flowers that are white and flushed with pink. The long, narrow, and hairy calyx-lobes give a light and feathery appearance to the flowers, which are produced continuously from May to November. It does best as a wall plant, and several beautiful examples may be seen in and around London, as also at Exeter, and in the South of Ireland.   ADENOCARPUS.  ADENOCARPUS DECORTICANS (_syn A. Boissieri_).--Spain, 1883. This little known hardy shrub, a native of the Sierra Nevada mountains, in Spain, is one of great beauty, and well worthy of extended culture. The flowers are produced abundantly, and are of a bright yellow colour, resembling those of our common Broom, to which family it is nearly allied. Peaty soil suits it well, and repeated trials have clearly proved that it is hardy, at least in the South of England.   AESCULUS.  AESCULUS CALIFORNICA (_syn Pavia californica_).--California. This is one of the handsomest species, of low, spreading habit, and blooming freely about midsummer.  AE. GLABRA (_syn Ae. rubicunda_).--Red-flowered Horse Chestnut. North America, 1820. If only for its neat and moderate growth, and attractive spikes of brightly-coloured flowers, this species must be considered as one of the handsomest and most valuable of small growing trees. Being of moderate size, for we rarely meet with specimens of greater height than 30 feet, and of very compact habit, it is rendered peculiarly suitable for planting in confined spots, and where larger growing and more straggling subjects would be out of place. It withstands soot and smoke well, and is therefore much valued for suburban planting. The long spikes of pretty red flowers are usually produced in great abundance, and as they stand well above the foliage, and are of firm lasting substance, they have a most pleasing and attractive appearance. As there are numerous forms of the red-flowered Horse Chestnut, differing much in the depth of flower colouring, it may be well to warn planters, for some of these have but a faint tinge of pink overlying a dirty yellowish-green groundwork, while the finest and most desirable tree has the flowers of a decided pinky-red. There is a double-flowered variety Ae. glabra flore-pleno (_syn Ae. rubicunda flore-pleno_) and one of particular merit named Ae. rubicunda Briotii.  AE. HIPPOCASTANUM.--The Common Horse Chestnut. Asia, 1629. A fine hardy free-flowering tree, supposed to have been introduced from Asia, and of which there are several varieties, including a double-flowered, a variegated, and several lobed and cut-leaved forms. The tree needs no description, the spikes of pinky-white flowers, which are produced in great abundance, and ample foliage rendering it one of, if not the handsomest tree of our acquaintance. It gives a pleasing shade, and forms an imposing and picturesque object in the landscape, especially where the conditions of soil--a rich free loam--are provided. Ae. Hippocastanum alba flore-pleno (the double white Horse Chestnut), has a decidedly pyramidal habit of growth, and the flowers, which are larger than those of the species, are perfectly double. It is a very distinct and desirable large growing tree. Ae. Hippocastanum laciniata and Ae. Hippocastanum digitalis are valuable for their divided leaves; while Ae. Hippocastanum foliis variegatis has the foliage rather irregularly variegated.  AE. PARVIFLORA (_syn Pavia macrostachya_).--Buckeye. North America, 1820. This is very distinct, and possesses feature which are shared by no other hardy tree or shrub in cultivation. Rarely exceeding 12 feet in height, and with a spread of often as much as 20 feet, this shrub forms a perfect hemisphere of foliage, and which, when tipped with the pretty fragrant flowers, renders it one of the most effective and handsome. The foliage is large, and resembles that of the common Horse Chestnut, while the pure white flowers, with their long projecting stamens and red-tipped anthers, are very pretty and imposing when at their best in July. It succeeds well in rich, dampish loam, and as a shrub for standing alone in any conspicuous position it has, indeed, few equals.  AE. PAVIA (_syn Pavia rubra_).--Red Buckeye. North America, 1711. A small growing and slender-branched tree or shrub, which bears an abundance of brownish-scarlet flowers. There are several good varieties, two of the best being Ae. Pavia atrosanguinea, and Ae. Pavia Whittleyana, with small, brilliant red flowers.  There are several other species, such as Ae. Pavia humilis (_syn Pavia humilis_) of trailing habit; Ae. flava (_syn Pavia flava_) bearing pretty yellow flowers; Ae. Pavia macrocarpa (_syn Pavia macrocarpa_) an open-headed and graceful tree; Ae. flava discolor (_syn Pavia discolor_); and Ae. chinensis; but they have not been found very amenable to cultivation, except in very favoured parts of the South of England and Ireland.   AILANTHUS.  AILANTHUS GLANDULOSA.--Tree of Heaven. China, 1751. A handsome, fast-growing tree, with large pinnate leaves that are often fully three feet long, and terminal erect clusters of not very showy greenish-white flowers that exhale a rather disagreeable odour. It is one of the most distinct and imposing of pinnate-leaved trees, and forms a neat specimen for the lawn or park. Light loam or a gravelly subsoil suits it well.   AKEBIA.  AKEBIA QUINATA.--Chinese Akebia. China, 1845. This, with its peculiarly-formed and curiously-coloured flowers,"]]]
