Again I saw that       grim face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the       precursor of another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I       don’t think I could have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred       times more difficult than getting up. But I had no time to think       of the danger, for another stone sang past me as I hung by my       hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but, by       the blessing of God, I landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path.       I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the       darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence, with the       certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.        “I had only one confidant—my brother Mycroft. I owe you many       apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it       should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you       would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end       had you not yourself thought that it was true. Several times       during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to       you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me       should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my       secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when       you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show       of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention       to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable       results. As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to       obtain the money which I needed. The course of events in London       did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty       gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most       vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for two years in       Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa, and       spending some days with the head lama. You may have read of the       remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am       sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news       of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca,       and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum       the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office.       Returning to France, I spent some months in a research into the       coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at       Montpellier, in the south of France. Having concluded this to my       satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now       left in London, I was about to return when my movements were       hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery,       which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed       to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over       at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw       Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had       preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been.       So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o’clock to-day I found       myself in my old armchair in my own old room, and only wishing       that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair       which he has so often adorned.”        Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that       April evening—a narrative which would have been utterly       incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of       the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had       never thought to see again. In some manner he had learned of my       own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner       rather than in his words. “Work is the best antidote to sorrow,       my dear Watson,” said he; “and I have a piece of work for us both       to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion,       will in itself justify a man’s life on this planet.” In vain I       begged him to tell me more. “You will hear and see enough before       morning,” he answered. “We have three years of the past to       discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start       upon the notable adventure of the empty house.”        It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself       seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the       thrill of adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and       silent. As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere       features, I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his       thin lips compressed. I knew not what wild beast we were about to       hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but I was well       assured, from the bearing of this master huntsman, that the       adventure was a most grave one—while the sardonic smile which       occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good       for the object of our quest.        I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes       stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed       that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right       and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the       utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. Our route was       certainly a singular one. Holmes’s knowledge of the byways of       London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly       and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables,       the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at last       into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us       into Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he       turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden       gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back       door of a house. We entered together, and he closed it behind us.        The place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an       empty house. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare       planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the       paper was hanging in ribbons. Holmes’s cold, thin fingers closed       round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall, until I dimly       saw the murky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned suddenly       to the right and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty       room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the       centre from the lights of the street beyond. There was no lamp       near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only       just discern each other’s figures within. My companion put his       hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.        “Do you know where we are?” he whispered.        “Surely that is Baker Street,” I answered, staring through the       dim window.        “Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our       own old quarters.”        “But why are we here?”        “Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque       pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little       nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show       yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms—the starting-point       of so many of your little fairy-tales? We will see if my three       years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise       you.”        I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my       eyes fell upon it, I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The       blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. The       shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in       hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. There       was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the       shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned       half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black       silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a       perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out       my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me.       He was quivering with silent laughter.        “Well?” said he.        “Good heavens!” I cried. “It is marvellous.”        “I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite       variety,” said he, and I recognized in his voice the joy and       pride which the artist takes in his own creation. “It really is       rather like me, is it not?”        “I should be prepared to swear that it was you.”        “The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of       Grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust       in wax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker       Street this afternoon.”        “But why?”        “Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for       wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was       really elsewhere.”        “And you thought the rooms were watched?”        “I _knew_ that they were watched.”        “By whom?”        “By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader       lies in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew,       and only they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they       believed that I should come back to my rooms. They watched them       continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.”        “How do you know?”        “Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my       window. He is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a       garroter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the       jew’s-harp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great deal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/108"],["title","The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#3)"],["body","       the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom       friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff,       the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is the       man who is after me to-night Watson, and that is the man who is       quite unaware that we are after _him_.”        My friend’s plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this       convenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the       trackers tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and       we were the hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness       and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front       of us. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he       was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the       stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night and the       wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were       moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and       cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same       figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to       be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house       some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion’s       attention to them; but he gave a little ejaculation of       impatience, and continued to stare into the street. More than       once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his       fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming       uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he       had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street       gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in       uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him,       when I raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again       experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched       Holmes’s arm, and pointed upward.        “The shadow has moved!” I cried.        It was indeed no longer the profile, but the back, which was       turned towards us.        Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his       temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his       own.        “Of course it has moved,” said he. “Am I such a farcical bungler,       Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy, and expect that       some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We       have been in this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some       change in that figure eight times, or once in every quarter of an       hour. She works it from the front, so that her shadow may never       be seen. Ah!” He drew in his breath with a shrill, excited       intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole       attitude rigid with attention. Outside the street was absolutely       deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway,       but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save only       that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure       outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that       thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement.       An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of       the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers       which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend       more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and       motionless before us.        But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had       already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not       from the direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very       house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An       instant later steps crept down the passage—steps which were meant       to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty       house. Holmes crouched back against the wall, and I did the same,       my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through       the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than       the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then       he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was       within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced       myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea       of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the       window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a       foot. As he sank to the level of this opening, the light of the       street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his       face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His       two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working       convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting       nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An       opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening       dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face       was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his       hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it       down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the       pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied       himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if       a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon       the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength       upon some lever, with the result that there came a long,       whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click.       He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his       hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He       opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the       breech-lock. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the       barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long       moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered       along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he       cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target,       the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of       his foresight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then       his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud       whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant       Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman’s back, and hurled       him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with       convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat, but I struck       him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped       again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my       comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter       of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform,       with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front       entrance and into the room.        “That you, Lestrade?” said Holmes.        “Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It’s good to see you       back in London, sir.”        “I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected       murders in one year won’t do, Lestrade. But you handled the       Molesey Mystery with less than your usual—that’s to say, you       handled it fairly well.”        We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a       stalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers       had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the       window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced       two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I       was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.        It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was       turned towards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the       jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great       capacities for good or for evil. But one could not look upon his       cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the       fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow,       without reading Nature’s plainest danger-signals. He took no heed       of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes’s face with an       expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended.       “You fiend!” he kept on muttering. “You clever, clever fiend!”        “Ah, Colonel!” said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar.       “‘Journeys end in lovers’ meetings,’ as the old play says. I       don’t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you       favoured me with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above the       Reichenbach Fall.”        The colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance.       “You cunning, cunning fiend!” was all that he could say.        “I have not introduced you yet,” said Holmes. “This, gentlemen,       is Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty’s Indian Army,       and the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever       produced. I believe I am correct Colonel, in saying that your bag       of tigers still remains unrivalled?”        The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my       companion. With his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was       wonderfully like a tiger himself.        “I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a       _shikari_,” said Holmes. “It must be very familiar to you. Have       you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with       your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? This       empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger. You have possibly       had other guns in reserve in case there should"]]]
