But it is the land of the young, the energetic, and the ambitious, the ideal home of the very rich and the laboring classes.  I am none of those--hence here I stay.  I turn my eyes to the west often with a queer sort of amazed pride.  If I were a foreigner--of any race but French--I 'd work my passage out there in an emigrant ship.  As it is, I did forty-five years of hard labor there, and I consider that I earned the freedom to die where I please.  I can see in \"my mind's eye\" the glitter in yours as you wrote--and underscored--I'll wager you spend half your days in writing letters back to the land you have willfully deserted.  As well have stayed among us and talked--and you talk so much better than you write. \"Tut! tut! That is nasty.\"  Of course I do not deny that I shall miss the inspiration of your contradictions--or do you call it repartee? I scorn your arguments, and I hereby swear that you shall not worry another remonstrance from me.  You ask me how it happens that I wandered in this direction, into a part of the country about which you do not remember to have ever heard me talk, when there were so many places that would have seemed to you to be more interesting.  Well, this is more interesting than you think.  You must not fancy that a place is not interesting because you can't find it in Hare, and because Henry James never talked about it.  That was James's misfortune and not his fault.  The truth is I did look in many more familiar directions before fortunate accident led me here.  I had an idea that I wanted to live on the heights of Montmorency, in the Jean Jacques Rousseau country.  But it was terribly expensive--too near to Enghien and its Casino and baccarat tables.  Then I came near to taking a house near Viroflay, within walking distance of Versailles.  But at the very mention of that all my French friends simply howled.  \"It was too near to Paris\"; \"it was the chosen route of the Apaches\"; and so on and so forth.  I did not so much care for the situation.  It was too familiar, and it was not really country, it was only suburbs.  But the house attracted me.  It was old and quaint, and the garden was pretty, and it was high.  Still it was too expensive.  After that I found a house well within my means at Poigny, about an hour, by diligence, from Rambouillet.  That did attract me.  It was real country, but it had no view and the house was very small.  Still I had got so tired of hunting that I was actually on the point of taking it when one of my friends accidentally found this place.  If it had been made to order it could not have suited me better--situation, age, price, all just to my taste.  I put over a year and a half into the search.  Did I keep it to myself well?  Besides, the country here had a certain novelty to me.  I know the country on the other side of the Petit Morin, but all this is new to me except Meaux.  At first the house did not look habitable to me.  It was easily made so, however, and it has great possibilities, which will keep me busy for years.  Although you do not know this part of the country, it has, for me, every sort of attraction--historical as well as picturesque.  Its historical interest is rather for the student than the tourist, and I love it none the less for that.  If ever you relent and come to see me, I can take you for some lovely walks.  I can, on a Sunday afternoon, in good weather, even take you to the theater--what is more, to the theater to see the players of the Comedie Francaise.  It is only half an hour's walk from my house to Pont-aux-Dames, where Coquelin set up his maison de retraite for aged actors, and where he died and is buried.  In the old park, where the du Barry used to walk in the days when Louis XVI clapped her in prison on a warrant wrung from the dying old king, her royal lover, there is an open-air theater, and there, on Sundays, the actors of the Theatre Francais play, within sight of the tomb of the founder of the retreat, under the very trees--and they are stately and noble--where the du Barry walked.  Of course I shall only take you there if you insist.  I have outgrown the playhouse.  I fancy that I am much more likely to sit out on the lawn and preach to you on how the theater has missed its mission than I am--unless you insist--to take you down to the hill to listen to Moliere or Racine.  If, however, that bores you,--it would me,--you can sit under the trees and close your eyes while I give you a Stoddard lecture without the slides.  I shall tell you about the little walled town of Crecy, still surrounded by its moat, where the tiny little houses stand in gardens with their backs on the moat, each with its tiny footbridge, that pulls up, just to remind you that it was once a royal city, with drawbridge and portcullis, a city in which kings used to stay, and in which Jeanne d'Arc slept one night on her way back from crowning her king at Rheims: a city that once boasted ninety-nine towers. Half a dozen of these towers still stand.  Their thick walls are now pierced with windows, in which muslin curtains blow in the wind, to say that to-day they are the humble homes of simple people, and to remind you of what warfare was in the days when such towers were a defense.  Why, the very garden in which you will be sitting when I tell you this was once a part of the royal estate, and the last Lord of the Land was the Duke de Penthievre.  I thought that fact rather amusing when I found it out, considering that the house I came so near to taking at Poigny was on the Rambouillet estate where his father, the Duke de Toulouse, one of Louis XIV's illegitimate sons, died, where the Duke de Penthievre was born, and where he buried his naughty son, the Duke de Lamballe.  Of course, while I am telling you things like this you will have to bring your imagination into play, as very few vestiges of the old days remain.  I still get just as much fun out of Il y avait une fois, even when the \"once on a time\" can only be conjured up with closed eyes. Still, I can show you some dear little old chapels, and while I am telling you about it you will probably hear the far-off, sad tolling of a bell, and I shall say to you \"Ca sonne a Bouleurs.\" It will be the church bells at Bouleurs, a tiny, tree-shaded hamlet, on another hilltop, from which, owing to its situation, the bells, which rarely ring save for a funeral, can be heard at a great distance, as they have rung over the valley for years.  They sound so sad in the still air that the expression, Ca sonne a Bouleurs, has come to mean bad luck. In all the towns where the bell can be heard, a man who is having bad luck at cards, or has made a bad bargain, or has been tricked in any way, invariably remarks, \"Ca sonne a Bouleurs.\"  I could show you something more modern in the way of historical association.  For example, from the road at the south side of my hill I can show you the Chateau de la Haute Maison, with its mansard and Louis XVI pavilions, where Bismarck and Favre had their first unsuccessful meeting, when this hill was occupied by the Germans in 1870 during the siege of Paris.  And fifteen minutes' walk from here is the pretty Chateau de Conde, which was then the home of Casimir-Perier, and if you do not remember him as the President of the Republic who resigned rather than face the Dreyfus case, you may remember him as the father-in-law of Madame Simone, who unsuccessfully stormed the American theater, two years ago.  You ask me how isolated I am.  Well, I am, and I am not.  My house stands in the middle of my garden.  That is a certain sort of isolation. There is a house on the opposite side of the road, much nearer than I wish it were.  Luckily it is rarely occupied.  Still, when it is, it is over-occupied.  At the foot of the hill--perhaps five hundred yards away--are the tiny hamlet of Joncheroy and the little village of Voisins.  Just above me is the hamlet of Huiry--half a dozen houses. You see that is not sad.  So cheer up.  So far as I know the commune has no criminal record, and I am not on the route of tramps.  Remember, please, that, in those last winters in Paris, I did not prove immune to contagions.  There is nothing for me to catch up here--unless it be the gayety with which the air is saturated.  You ask me also how it happens that I am living again \"near by Quincy?\" As true as you live, I never thought of the coincidence.  If you please, we pronounce it \"Kansee.\" When I read your question I laughed.  I remembered that Abelard, when he was first condemned, retired to the Hermitage of Quincy, but when I took down Larousse to look it up, what do you think I found? Simply this and nothing more: \"Quincy: Ville des Etats-Unis (Massachusetts), 28,000 habitants.\"  Isn't that droll? However, I know that there was a Sire de Quincy centuries ago, so I will look him up and let you know what I find.  The morning paper--always late here--brings the startling news of the assassination of the Crown Prince of Austria.  What an unlucky family that has been! Franz Josef must be a tough old gentleman to have stood up against so many shocks.  I used to feel so sorry for him when Fate dealt him another blow that would have been a \"knock-out\" for most people.  But he has stood so many, and outlived happier people, that I begin to believe that if the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, the hides, or the hearts, of some people are toughened to stand the gales of Fate.  Well, I imagine that Austria will not grieve much--though she may be mad--over the loss of a none too popular crown prince, whose morganatic wife could never be crowned, whose children cannot inherit, and who could only have kept the throne warm for a while for the man who now steps into line a little sooner than he would have had this not happened.  If a man will be a crown prince in these times he must take the consequences.

The \"Paths of Glory lead but to the grave,\" so what matters it, really, out by what door one goes?  This will reach you soon after you arrive in the great city of tall buildings.  More will follow, and I expect they will be so gay that you will rejoice to have even a postal tie with La Belle France, to which, if you are a real good American, you will come back when you die--if you do not before.     IV    July 16, 1914.  Your Fourth of July letter came this morning.  It was lively reading, especially coming so soon after my first quatorze de juillet in the country.  The day was a great contrast to the many remembrances I have of Bastille Day in Paris.  How I remember my first experience of that fete, when my bedroom window overlooked one of the squares where the band played for the three nights of dancing. That was a fierce experience after the novelty of the first night had worn off, when hour after hour the dance music droned on, and hour after hour the dancing feet on the pavement nearly drove me frantic.  To offset it I have memories of the Champs-Elysees and the Place de l'Hotel de Ville turned into a fairyland.  I am glad I saw all that.  The memory hangs in my mind like a lovely picture.  Out here it was all as still as--I was going to say Sunday, but I should have to say a New England Sunday, as out here Sunday is just like any other day.  There was not even a ringing of bells.  The only difference there was to me was that Amelie drove Pere over to Coutevroult, on the other side of the valley of the Grand Morin, where he played for the dance, and did not get back until long after daylight.  I did put out my flags in honor of the day.  That was the extent of my celebrating.  In the evening there was a procession at Voisins, and from Meaux and the other towns on the hill there was an occasional rocket.  It was not really an exciting day.  The procession at Voisins was a primitive affair, but, to me, all the prettier for that.  It looked so quaint with its queer lanterns, its few flags, its children and men in blouses, strolling through the crooked, hilly streets of the old town, to the tap of the drum.  No French procession, except it be soldiers, ever marches.  If you ever saw a funeral procession going through the street, or one going about a church, you do not need to be told that.  I was glad that this little procession here kept so much of its old-time character, but I was sorry it was not gayer.  Still, it was so picturesque that it made me regret anew, what I have so many times regretted of late years, that so many of the old habits of country life in France are passing away, as they are, for that matter, all over Europe, along with ignorance and national costumes.  I must tell you that up to three years ago it was the custom in this commune, which, simply because it is not on a railroad, has preserved its old-days air and habits, for wedding and baptismal parties to walk in procession through the streets from the house to the church and back again.  Pere Abelard used to head the procession, playing on his violin. There has been but one event of that kind since I came, and I am afraid it will be the last.  That was for the baptism of the first grandchild of a French officer who had married a woman born in this commune, and the older members of the family had a desire to keep up the old traditions.  The church is at Quincy, just a step off the route nationale to Meaux.  Pere walked ahead,--he could not be accused of marching,--fiddling away for dear life.  The pretty young godmother carried the baby, in its wonderful christening finery, walking between the grandmother and the father, and the guests, all in their gayest clothes, followed on as they liked behind, all stepping out a little on account of the fiddle ahead.  They came back from the church in the same way, only father carried the baby, and the godmother scattered her largesse among the village children.  It is a pity that such pretty customs die out.  Wedding parties must have looked so attractive going along these country roads.  The fashion that has replaced it is unattractive.  To-day they think it much more chic to hire a big barge and drive down to Esbly and have a rousing breakfast and dance in the big hall which every country hotel has for such festivities.  Such changes are in the spirit of the times, so I suppose one must not complain.  I should not if people were any happier, but I cannot see that they are.  However, I suppose that will come when the Republic is older.  The responsibility which that has put on the people has made them more serious than they used to be.  I don't blame you for laughing at the idea of me in a donkey cart. You would laugh harder if you could see the cart and me.  I do look droll. But this is the land where nothing astonishes any one, thank Heaven. But you wait until I get my complet de velours--which is to say my velveteens.  I shall match up with the rig then, never fear. Rome was not built in a day, nor can a lady from the city turn into a country-looking lady in the wink of an eye.  By the time you have sufficiently overcome your prejudices as to come out and see me with your own eyes, I'll fit into the landscape and the cart in great style.  Absolutely no news to write you, unless you will consider it news that my hedge of dahlias, which I planted myself a month ago, is coming up like nothing else in the world but Jack's Beanstalk.  Nothing but weeds ever grew so rank before.  Pere says I was too generous with my biogene--the latest French thing in fertilizers.  But I did want them to be nourished in a rich soil--and come up quick.  They did.  I can actually see them grow.  I am almost afraid to tell you that they are over two feet high now.  Of course you won't believe me.  But it is not a fairy tale.  I would not have believed it myself if I had not seen it.  Alas! I find that I cannot break myself of reading the newspapers, and reading them eagerly.  It is all the fault of that nasty affair in Servia.  I have a dim recollection that I was very flippant about it in my last letter to you.  After all, woman proposes and politics upset her proposition.  There seems to be no quick remedy for habit, more's the pity.  It is a nasty outlook.  We are simply holding our breaths here.     July 30,1914.   This will be only a short letter--more to keep my promise to you than because I feel in the mood to write.  Events have broken that.  It looks, after all, as if the Servian affair was to become a European affair, and that, what looked as if it might happen during the Balkan War is really coming to pass--a general European uprising.  It is an odd thing.  It seems it is an easy thing to change one's environment, but not so easy to change one's character.  I am just as excited over the ugly business as I should have been had I remained near the boulevards, where I could have got a newspaper half a dozen times a day.  I only get one a day, and this morning I got that one with difficulty.  My \"Figaro,\" which comes out by mail, has not come at all.  Well, it seems that the so-called \"alarmists\" were right.  Germany has NOT been turning her nation into an army just to divert her population, nor spending her last mark on ships just to amuse herself, and keep Prince Henry busy.  I am sitting here this morning, as I suppose all France is doing, simply holding my breath to see what England is going to do.  I imagine there is small doubt about it.  I don't see how she can do anything but fight. It is hard to realize that a big war is inevitable, but it looks like it.  It was staved off, in spite of Germany's perfidy, during the Balkan troubles.  If it has to come now, just imagine what it is going to mean! It will be the bloodiest affair the world has ever seen--a war in the air, a war under the sea as well as on it, and carried out with the most effective man-slaughtering machines ever used in battle.  I need not tell you--you know, we have so often talked about it--how I feel about war.  Yet many times since I came to France to live, I have felt as if I could bear another one, if only it gave Alsace and Lorraine back to us--us meaning me and France.  France really deserves her revenge for the humiliation of 1870 and that beastly Treaty of Frankfort.  I don't deny that 1870 was the making of modern France, or that, since the Treaty of Frankfort, as a nation she has learned a lesson of patience that she sorely needed.  But now that Germany is preparing--is really prepared to attack her again--well, the very hair on my head rises up at the idea.  There have been times in the last ten years when I have firmly believed that she could not be conquered again. But Germany! Well, I don't know.  If she is, it will not be for lack of nerve or character.  Still, it is no secret that she is not ready, or that the anti-military party is strong,--and with that awful Caillaux affair; I swore to myself that nothing should tempt me to speak of it. It has been so disgraceful. Still, it is so in the air just now that it has to be recognized as pitifully significant and very menacing to political unity.  The tension here is terrible.  Still, the faces of the men are stern, and every one is so calm--the silence is deadly.  There is an absolute suspension of work in the fields.  It is as if all France was holding its breath.  One word before I forget it again.  You say that you have asked me twice if I have any friend near me.  I am sure I have already answered that--yes! I have a family of friends at Voulangis, about two miles the other side of Crecy-en-Brie.  Of course neighbors do not see one another in the country as often as in the city, but there they are; so I hasten to relieve your mind just now, when there is a menace of war, and I am sitting tight on my hilltop on the road to the frontier.
