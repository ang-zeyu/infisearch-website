Holly. Four males, four females. Many plants, like many animals, are furnished with arms for their protection; these are either aculei, prickles, as in rose and barberry, which are formed from the outer bark of the plant; or spinæ, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an elongation of the wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former; or stimuli, stings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a venomous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals. The shrubs and trees, which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as goosberry, and gorse; and would be quickly devoured, if not thus armed; the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants lose their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals lose their ferocity; and some of them their horns. A curious circumstance attends the large hollies in Needwood-forest, they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high, and have smooth leaves above; as if they were conscious that horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches. See note on Meadia, and on Mancinella. The numerous clumps of hollies in Needwood-forest serve as landmarks to direct the travellers across it in various directions; and as a shelter to the deer and cattle in winter; and in scarce seasons supply them with much food. For when the upper branches, which are without prickles, are cut down, the deer crop the leaves and peel off the bark. The bird-lime made from the bark of hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum, or Indian rubber, as it is called. There is a fossile elastic bitumen found at Matlock in Derbyshire, which much resembles these substances in its elasticity and inflammability. The thorns of the mimosa cornigere resemble cow's horns in appearance as well as in use. System of Vegetables, p. 782.]           A thousand steely points on every scale         Form the bright terrors of his bristly male.-- 165  So arm'd, immortal Moore uncharm'd the spell,         And slew the wily dragon of the well.--         Sudden with rage their _injur'd_ bosoms burn,         Retort the insult, or the wound return;         _Unwrong'd_, as gentle as the breeze that sweeps 170  The unbending harvests or undimpled deeps,         They guard, the Kings of Needwood's wide domains,         Their sister-wives and fair infantine trains;         Lead the lone pilgrim through the trackless glade,         Or guide in leafy wilds the wand'ring maid.  175  So WRIGHT's bold pencil from Vesuvio's hight         Hurls his red lavas to the troubled night;         From Calpè starts the intolerable flash,         Skies burst in flames, and blazing oceans dash;--         Or bids in sweet repose his shades recede, 180  Winds the still vale, and slopes the velvet mead;         On the pale stream expiring Zephyrs sink,         And Moonlight sleeps upon its hoary brink.          Gigantic Nymph! the fair KLEINHOVIA reigns,         The grace and terror of Orixa's plains;   [_Hurls his red lavas_. l. 176. Alluding to the grand paintings of the eruptions of Vesuvius, and of the destruction of the Spanish vessels before Gibraltar; and to the beautiful landscapes and moonlight scenes, by Mr. Wright of Derby.]  [_Kleinhovia_. l. 183. In this class the males in each flower are supported by the female. The name of the class may be translated \"Viragoes,\" or \"Feminine Males.\"  The largest tree perhaps in the world is of the same natural order as Kleinhovia, it is the Adansonia, or Ethiopian Sour-gourd, or African Calabash tree. Mr. Adanson says the diameter of the trunk frequently exceeds 25 feet, and the horizontal branches are from 45 to 55 feet long, and so large that each branch is equal to the largest trees of Europe. The breadth of the top is from 120 to 150 feet. And one of the roots bared only in part by the wasting away of the earth by the river, near which it grew, measured 110 feet long; and yet these stupendous trees never exceed 70 feet in height. Voyage to Senegal.]           O'er her warm cheek the blush of beauty swims,         And nerves Herculean bend her sinewy limbs;         With frolic eye she views the affrighted throng, 190  And shakes the meadows, as she towers along,         With playful violence displays her charms,         And bears her trembling lovers in her arms.         So fair THALESTRIS shook her plumy crest,         And bound in rigid mail her jutting breast; 195  Poised her long lance amid the walks of war,         And Beauty thunder'd from Bellona's car;         Greece arm'd in vain, her captive heroes wove         The chains of conquest with the wreaths of love.          When o'er the cultured lawns and dreary wastes 200  Retiring Autumn flings her howling blasts,         Bends in tumultuous waves the struggling woods,         And showers their leafy honours on the floods,         In withering heaps collects the flowery spoil,         And each chill insect sinks beneath the soil; 205  Quick flies fair TULIPA the loud alarms,         And folds her infant closer in her arms;         In some lone cave, secure pavilion, lies,         And waits the courtship of serener skies.--         So, six cold moons, the Dormouse charm'd to rest, 210  Indulgent Sleep! beneath thy eider breast,         In fields of Fancy climbs the kernel'd groves,         Or shares the golden harvest with his loves.--   [_Tulipa_. l. 205. Tulip. What is in common language called a bulbous root, is by Linneus termed the Hybernacle, or Winter-lodge of the young plant. As these bulbs in every respect resemble buds, except in their being produced under ground, and include the leaves and flower in miniature, which are to be expanded in the ensuing spring. By cautiously cutting in the early spring through the concentric coats of a tulip-root, longitudinally from the top to the base, and taking them off successively, the whole flower of the next summer's tulip is beautifully seen by the naked eye, with its petals, pistil, and stamens; the flowers exist in other bulbs, in the same manner, as in Hyacinths, but the individual flowers of these being less, they are not so easily differed, or so conspicuous to the naked eye.  In the seeds of the Nymphæa Nelumbo, the leaves of the plant are seen so distinctly, that Mr. Ferber found out by them to what plant the seeds belonged. Amoen. Acad. V. vi. No. 120. He says that Mariotte first observed the future flower and foliage in the bulb of a Tulip; and adds, that it is pleasant to see in the buds of the Hepatica, and Pedicularia hirsuta, yet lying in the earth; and in the gems of Daphne Mezereon; and at the base of Osmunda Lunaria, a perfect plant of the future year compleat in all its parts. Ibid.]           But bright from earth amid the troubled air         Ascends fair COLCHICA with radiant hair, 215  Warms the cold bosom of the hoary year,         And lights with Beauty's blaze the dusky sphere.         _Three_ blushing Maids the intrepid Nymph attend,         And _six_ gay Youths, enamour'd train! defend.         So shines with silver guards the Georgian star, 220  And drives on Night's blue arch his glittering car;         Hangs o'er the billowy clouds his lucid form,         Wades through the mist, and dances in the storm.  [_Colchicum autumnale_. I. 214. Autumnal Meadow-saffron. Six males, three females. The germ is buried within the root, which thus seems to constitute a part of the flower. Families of Plants, p. 242 These singular flowers appear in the autumn without any leaves, whence in some countries they are called Naked Ladies: in the March following the green leaves spring up, and in April the seed-vessel rises from the ground; the seeds ripen in May, contrary to the usual habits of vegetables, which slower in the spring, and ripen their seeds in the autumn. Miller's Dict. The juice of the root of this plant is so acrid as to produce violent effects on the human constitution, which also prevents it from being eaten by subterranean insects, and thus guards the seed-vessel during the winter. The defoliation of deciduous trees is announced by the flowering of the Colchicum; of these the ash is the last that puts forth its leaves, and the first that loses them. Phil. Bot. p. 275.  The Hamamelis, Witch Hazle, is another plant which flowers in autumn; when the leaves fall off, the flowers come out in clusters from the joints of the branches, and in Virginia ripen their seed in the ensuing spring; but in this country their seeds seldom ripen. Lin. Spec. Plant. Miller's Dict.]           GREAT HELIANTHUS guides o'er twilight plains         In gay solemnity his Dervise-trains; 225  Marshall'd in _fives_ each gaudy band proceeds,         Each gaudy band a plumed Lady leads;         With zealous step he climbs the upland lawn,         And bows in homage to the rising dawn;         Imbibes with eagle-eye the golden ray, 230  And watches, as it moves, the orb of day.   [_Helianthus_. l. 223. Sun flower. The numerous florets, which constitute the disk of this flower, contain in each five males surrounding one female, the five stamens have their anthers connected at top, whence the name of the class \"confederate males;\" see note on Chondrilla. The sun-flower follows the course of the sun by nutation, not by twisting its stem. (Hales veg. stat.) Other plants, when they are confined in a room, turn the shining surface of their leaves, and bend their whole branches to the light. See Mimosa.]  [_A plumed Lady leads_. l. 226. The seeds of many plants of this class are furnished with a plume, by which admirable mechanism they are disseminated by the winds far from their parent stem, and look like a shuttlecock, as they fly. Other seeds are disseminated by animals; of these some attach themselves to their "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],["title","The Botanic Garden. Part II. (#5)"],["body","or feathers by a gluten, as misleto; others by hooks, as cleavers, burdock, hounds-tongue; and others are swallowed whole for the sake of the fruit, and voided uninjured, as the hawthorn, juniper, and some grasses. Other seeds again disperse themselves by means of an elastic seed-vessel, as Oats, Geranium, and Impatiens; and the seeds of aquatic plants, and of those which grow on the banks of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents, into which they fall. See Impatiens. Zostera. Cassia. Carlïna.]           Queen of the marsh, imperial DROSERA treads         Rush-fringed banks, and moss-embroider'd beds;         Redundant folds of glossy silk surround         Her slender waist, and trail upon the ground; 235  _Five_ sister-nymphs collect with graceful ease,         Or spread the floating purple to the breeze;         And _five_ fair youths with duteous love comply         With each soft mandate of her moving eye.         As with sweet grace her snowy neck she bows, 240  A zone of diamonds trembles round her brows;         Bright shines the silver halo, as she turns;         And, as she steps, the living lustre burns.   [_Drosera_. l. 231. Sun-dew. Five males, five females. The leaves of this marsh-plant are purple, and have a fringe very unlike other vegetable productions. And, which is curious, at the point of every thread of this erect fringe stands a pellucid drop of mucilage, resembling a ducal coronet. This mucus is a secretion from certain glands, and like the viscous material round the flower-stalks of Silene (catchfly) prevents small insects from infesting the leaves. As the ear-wax in animals seems to be in part designed to prevent fleas and other insects from getting into their ears. See Silene. Mr. Wheatly, an eminent surgeon in Cateaton-street, London, observed these leaves to bend upwards, when an insect settled on them, like the leaves of the muscipula veneris, and pointing all their globules of mucus to the centre, that they compleatly intangled and destroyed it. M. Broussonet, in the Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences for the year 1784. p. 615. after hiving described the motion of the Dionæa, adds, that a similar appearance has been observed in the leaves of two species of Drosera.]           Fair LONICERA prints the dewy lawn,         And decks with brighter blush the vermil dawn; 245  Winds round the shadowy rocks, and pansied vales,         And scents with sweeter breath the summer-gales;   [_Lonicera_. l. 243. Caprifolium. Honeysuckle. Five males, one female. Nature has in many flowers used a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary, or honey-gland, from insects. In the honey-suckle the petal terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and the honey is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monkshood, the nectaries stand upright like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds with such acrid matter that no insects penetrate it. In Helleborus, hellebore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle, like little pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the Columbine, Aquilegia, the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird, and the two petals standing upon each side to represent wings; whence its name of columbine, as if resembling a nest of young pigeons fluttering whilst their parent feeds them. The importance of the nectary in the economy of vegetation is explained at large in the notes on part the first.  Many insects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis for the purpose of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and butterflies: but the Sphinx Convolvuli, or unicorn moth, is furnished with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate. It carries it rolled up in concentric circles under its chin, and occasionally extends it to above three inches in length. This trunk consists of joints and muscles, and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the elephant; and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes. The excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey, keeps this beautiful insect fat and bulky; though it flies only in the evening, when the flowers have closed their petals, and are thence more difficult of access; at the same time the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its safety, by making it mistaken by the late sleeping birds for the flower it rests on.  Besides these there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys, commonly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with some kinds of the Delphinium, called Bee-larkspurs, to preserve their honey; in these the nectary and petals resemble in form and colour the insects, which plunder them: and thus it may be supposed, they often escape these hourly robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied. See note on Rubia, and Conserva polymorpha.]           With artless grace and native ease she charms,         And bears the Horn of Plenty in her arms.         _Five_ rival Swains their tender cares unfold, 250  And watch with eye askance the treasured gold.          Where rears huge Tenerif his azure crest,         Aspiring DRABA builds her eagle nest;         Her pendant eyry icy caves surround,         Where erst Volcanos min'd the rocky ground. 255  Pleased round the Fair _four_ rival Lords ascend         The shaggy steeps, _two_ menial youths attend.         High in the setting ray the beauty stands,         And her tall shadow waves on distant lands.   [_Draba_. I. 252. Alpina. Alpine Whitlow-grass. One female and six males. Four of these males stand above the other two; whence the name of the class \"four powers.\" I have observed in several plants of this class, that the two lower males arise, in a few-days after the opening of the flower, to the same height as the other four, not being mature as soon as the higher ones. See note on Gloriosa. All the plants of this class possess similar virtues; they are termed acrid and anti corbutic in their raw state, as mustard, watercress; when cultivated and boiled, they become a mild wholesome food, as cabbage, turnep.  There was formerly a Volcano on the Peake of Tenerif, which became extinct about the year 1684. Philos. Trans. In many excavations of the mountain, much below the summit, there is now found abundance of ice at all seasons. Tench's Expedition to Botany Bay, p. 12. Are these congelations in consequence of the daily solution of the hoar-frost which is produced on the summit during the night?]           Stay, bright inhabitant of air, alight, 260  Ambitious VISCA, from thy eagle-flight!--         ----Scorning the sordid soil, aloft she springs,         Shakes her white plume, and claps her golden wings;         High o'er the fields of boundless ether roves,         And seeks amid the clouds her soaring loves!  265  Stretch'd on her mossy couch, in trackless deeps,         Queen of the coral groves, ZOSTERA sleeps;   [_Viscum_. l. 260. Misletoe. Two houses. This plant never grows upon the ground; the foliage is yellow, and the berries milk-white; the berries are so viscous, as to serve for bird-lime; and when they fall, adhere to the branches of the tree, on which the plant grows, and strike root into its bark; or are carried to distant trees by birds. The Tillandsia, or wild pine, grows on other trees, like the Misletoe, but takes little or no nourishment from them, having large buckets in its leaves to collect and retain the rain water. See note on Dypsacus. The mosses, which grow on the bark of trees, take much nourishment from them; hence it is observed that trees, which are annually cleared from moss by a brush, grow nearly twice as fast. (Phil. Transact.) In the cyder countries the peasants brush their apple-trees annually.]  [_Zostera_. l. 266. Grass-wrack. Class, Feminine Males. Order, Many Males. It grows at the bottom of the sea, and rising to the surface, when in flower, covers many leagues; and is driven at length to the shore. During its time of floating on the sea, numberless animals live on the under surface of it; and being specifically lighter than the sea water, or being repelled by it, have legs placed as it were on their backs for the purpose of walking under it. As the Scyllcea. See Barbut's Genera Vermium. It seems necessary that the marriages of plants should be celebrated in the open air, either because the powder of the anther, or the mucilage on the stigma, or the  reservoir of honey might receive injury from the water. Mr. Needham observed, that in the ripe dust of every flower, examined by the microscope, some vesicles are perceived, from which a fluid had escaped; and that those, which still retain it, explode if they be wetted, like an eolopile suddenly exposed to a strong heat. These observations have been verified by Spallanzani and others. Hence rainy seasons make a scarcity of grain, or hinder its fecundity, by bursting the pollen before it arrives at the moist stigma of the flower. Spallanzani's Dissertations, v. II. p. 321. Thus the flowers of the male Vallisneria are produced under water, and when ripe detach themselves from the plant, and rising to the surface are wafted by the air to the female flowers. See Vallisneria.]           The silvery sea-weed matted round her bed,         And distant surges murmuring o'er her head.--         High in the flood her azure dome ascends, 270  The crystal arch on crystal columns bends;         Roof'd with translucent shell the turrets blaze,         And far in ocean dart their colour'd rays;         O'er the white floor successive shadows move,         As rise and break the ruffled waves above.-- 275  Around the nymph her mermaid-trains repair,         And weave with orient pearl her radiant hair;         With rapid fins she cleaves the watery way,         Shoots like a diver meteor up to day;         Sounds a loud conch, convokes a scaly band, 280  Her sea-born lovers, and ascends the strand.
