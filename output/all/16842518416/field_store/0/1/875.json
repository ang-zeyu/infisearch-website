Finding its scolding to be in vain, and that the boy would not go, the squirrel did the next best thing--bounded along from bough to bough; while, after waiting wearily in the hope of seeing David, the boy began to look round this tree and the next, and finally made his way some little distance farther into the forest, to be startled at last by a harsh cry which was answered from first one place and then another by the noisy party of jays that had been disturbed in their happy solitude.  To Robin it was just as if the first one had cried \"Hoi! I say, here's a boy.\"  And weary with waiting, and hungry as he was, the constant harsh shouting irritated the little fellow so that he hurried away followed by quite a burst of what seemed to be mocking cries, with the intention of finding the track leading across the forest; but he had not gone far before he found himself in an open glade, dotted with beautiful great oak trees, and nearly covered with the broad leaves of the bracken, which were agitated by something passing through and beneath, giving forth a grunting sound.  Directly after he caught sight of a long black back, then of others, and he saw that he was close to a drove of small black pigs, hunting for acorns.  One of the pigs found him at the same moment and saluted him with a sharp, barking sound wonderfully like that of a dog.  This was taken up directly by the other members of the drove, who with a great deal of barking and grunting came on to the attack, for they did not confine themselves to threatening, their life in the forest making them fierce enough to be dangerous.  Robin's first thought was to run away, but he knew that four legs are better than two for getting over the ground, and felt that the drove would attack him more fiercely if they saw that he was afraid.  His next idea was to climb 'up into the fork of one of the big trees, but he knew that there was not time.  So he obeyed his third notion, which was to jump to where a big piece of dead wood lay, pick it up, and hit the foremost pig across the nose with it.  That blow did wonders; it made the black pig which received it utter a dismal squeal, and its companions stop and stand barking and snapping all around him.  But the blow broke the piece of dead wood in two, and the fierce little animals were coming on again, when a voice cried:  \"Hi! you! knocking our tigs about!\"  And a rough boy about a couple of years older than Robin rushed into the middle of the herd, kicking first at one and then at another, banging them with a long hooked stick he held, and making them run squealing in all directions.  \"What are you knocking our tigs about for?\" cried the boy sharply, as he stared hard at the strange visitor to the forest, his eyes looking greedily at the little fellow's purple and white jerkin and his cap with a little white feather in it.  \"They were coming to bite me,\" said Robin quickly, while it struck him as funny that the boy should knock the pigs about himself.  \"What are you doing here?\" said the boy.  Robin told of his misfortune, and finished by saying:  \"I'm so hungry, and I want to go home.  Where can I get some breakfast?\"  \"Dunno,\" said the boy.  \"Have some of these?\"  He took a handful of acorns from a dirty satchel, and held them out, Robin catching at them eagerly, putting one between his white teeth, and biting it, but only to make a face full of disgust.  \"It's bitter,\" he said.  \"It's not good to eat.\"  \"Makes our tigs fat,\" said the boy; \"look at 'em.\"  \"But I'm not a pig,\" said Robin.  \"I want some bread and milk. Where can I get some?\"  The boy shook his head.  \"Where do you live?\" asked Robin.  \"Along o' master.\"  \"Where's that?\"  The boy shook his head and stared at the cap and feather, one of his hands opening and shutting.  \"Will you show me the way home, then?\"  The boy shook his head again, and now stared at the velvet jerkin, then at his own garb, which consisted of a piece of sack with slits in it for his head and arms to come through, and a strip of cow-skin for a belt to hold it in.  \"I could show you where to get something,\" he said at last.  \"Well, show me,\" cried Robin.  \"You give me that jacket and cap, then,\" cried the boy, in a husky, low voice.  \"Give you my clothes?\" said Robin, wonderingly.  \"I can't do that.\"  \"Then I shall take 'em?\" said the boy, in a husky growl.  \"I'm so hungry,\" cried Robin.  \"Show me where to get something, and I'll give you my cap and feather.\"  \"I wants the jacket too,\" said the boy.  \"I tell you I can't give you that,\" cried Robin.  \"Then I means to take it.\"  Robin shrank away, and the boy turned upon him fiercely.  \"None of that,\" he cried.  \"See this here stick?  If you was to try to run away I should send it spinning after you, and it would break your legs and knock you down, and I could send the tigs after you, and they'd soon bring you back.\"  Robin drew a deep breath; he felt hot, and his hands clenched as he longed to strike out at his tyrant.  But the young swineherd was big and strong, and the little fellow knew that he could do next to nothing against such an enemy.  Then there was a pause.  Robin stood, hot, excited, and panting; the herd-boy threw himself down on his chest, rested his chin upon his hands, as he stared fiercely at Robin, and kicked his feet up and down; while the pigs roamed here and there, nuzzling the fallen acorns out from the bracken, and crunching them up loudly.  Robin wanted to run, and he did not want to run, and all at the same time, for his strongest desire just then was to fight his tyrant; and for some minutes neither spoke.  At last the big boy said, in a low, growling way:  \"Now then, are you going to give me them things?\"  \"No,\" said Robin, through his set teeth; and again there was silence.  \"You give 'em to me, and I'll show you the way to where they live and they'll give you roast deer and roast pig p'raps, for two of ourn's gone.  Master says he counted 'em, and they aren't all there, and he wales me with a strap because I let them take the pigs, and next time he counts 'em there's more than there was before, but he's whipped me all the same.  You give me them things, and I'll take you where you'll get lots to eat, and milk and eggs and apples.  D'yer hear?\"  \"I won't give them to you.  I can't--I mustn't,\" cried Robin passionately.  The boy said nothing, but looked away at his pigs, two of which were fighting.  \"Ah, would you?\" he cried; and he made believe to rush at them with his big hook-handled stick.  Robin was thrown off his guard, and before he was aware of it the boy made a side leap and, dropping his stick, seized him, threw him over on his back, and sat astride upon his chest.  \"Now won't you give em to me?\" cried the herd-boy; and he whipped off the cap and threw it to a little distance, with the result that half a dozen pigs rushed at it; and as he made a brave fight to get rid of his enemy, the last that Robin saw of his velvet cap and plume was that one black pig tore out the feather, while another was champing the velvet in his mouth.  It was a brave fight, but all in vain, and a few minutes later the boy was standing triumphantly over poor Robin, with the gay jerkin rolled up under his arm; and the little fellow struggled to his feet in his trunk hose and white linen shirt, hot, angry, and torn, and wishing with all his might that he were as big and strong as the tyrant who had mastered him.  \"I told yer I would,\" said the young ruffian, with a grin.  \"You should ha' given 'em to me at first, and then I shouldn't have hurt yer.  Come on; I'll show yer now where yer can get something to eat.\"  In his anger and shame Robin felt that he wanted no food now, only to go and hide himself away among the trees; but his enemy's next words had their effect.  \"You didn't want this here,\" he said.  \"You've got plenty on you now.  Better nor I have.  There, go straight on there, and I'll show yer.  D'yer hear?\"  \"I don't want to go now,\" said Robin fiercely.  \"Oh, don't yer?  Then I do.  You're agoing afore I makes yer, and when they've give yer a lot, you're going to eat part and bring some to me so's I can help eat the rest.  You bring a lot, mind, 'cause I can eat ever so much.  Now then, go on.\"  \"I can't--I don't want to,\" cried Robin.  \"You go first.\"  \"What, and master come, p'raps, and find me gone!  Likely! he'd give me the strap again. There, get on.\"  Robin winced, for the young ruffian picked up his stick and poked him as he would one of his pigs.  But the little fellow could not help himself, and he went on in the required direction among the trees, the forest growing darker and darker, till suddenly voices were heard, and the boy stopped,  \"You go straight along there,\" he said, \"and I'll wait.\"  \"No, you go,\" said Robin.  \"You know them.\"  \"Oh! yes, and them want some more pigs!  Want me to be leathered again?\"  Robin said \"No,\" but he felt all the time that he should like to see the young tyrant flogged and forced to return the folded up doublet; and he thought sadly of his spoiled and lost cap.     CHAPTER III  \"Now then, don't you be long,\" cried the young swineherd, and he raised his stick threateningly, and made another thrust at Robin, which was avoided; and feeling desperate now as well as hungry, feeling too, that it would be better to fall into any other hands, the little fellow ran on, following a faint track in and out among the trees, till he came suddenly into an opening, face to face with a group of fifty or sixty people busily engaged around a heap beneath a spreading beech tree.  Robin's first act was to stand and stare, for the heap consisted of bales similar to those with which he had seen the mules laden a couple of days back, and tied up together a few yards away were the very mules, while the little crowd of men who were busy bore a very strong resemblance to those by whom the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11097"],["title","Young Robin Hood (#2)"],["body","was made on the previous day.  Robin knew nothing in those days about the old proverb of jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire, but he felt something of the kind as he found himself face to face with the marauders who had seized upon the bales of cloth and put his aunt's servants to flight, and without a moment's hesitation he turned and began to hurry back, but ran into the arms of a huge fellow who caught him up as if he had been a baby.  [Illustration: Robin ran into the arms of a huge fellow, who caught him up as if he had been a baby.]  \"Hullo, giant!\" cried the big man, \"who are you?\"  And the party of men with him, armed with long bows and arrows, began to laugh merrily.  \"Let me go--let me go!\" cried the boy, struggling angrily.  \"Steady, steady, my little Cock Robin,\" said the man, in his big bluff way; \"don't fight, or you'll ruffle your feathers.\"  The boy ceased struggling directly.  \"How did you know my name was Robin?\" he said.  \"Guessed it, little one.  There, I shan't hurt you.  Where do you come from?\"  \"Ellton,\" said the boy.  \"But what are you doing here in the forest?\"  \"You came and fought David, and frightened him and the men away, and those are our mules and the cloth.\"  Robin stopped short, for the big man broke out into a loud whistle, and then laughed.  \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" he said; \"and so your name's Robin, is it?\"  The little fellow nodded.  \"Yes,\" he said.  \"What's yours?\"  \"John,\" said the great fellow, laughing heartily; \"and they call me little because I'm so big.  What do you think of that?\"  \"I think it's very stupid,\" said the boy.  \"I thought you must be Robin Hood.\"  \"Then you thought wrong. But if you thought that this one was you would be right.  Here he comes.\"  The boy looked in wonder at a tall man who looked short beside Little John, as he came up in coat of green with brown belt, a sword by his side, quiver of arrows hung on his back, and longbow in his hand.  \"What woodland bird have you got here, John?\" he said.  And the boy saw that he smiled pleasantly and did not look fierce or threatening.  \"A young Robin,\" said the big fellow; \"part of yesterday's plunder.\"  \"I want to find my way home,\" said the boy.  \"Will you please show me?\"  \"But you did not come here into the forest in shirt and hose, did you, my little man?\" said the great outlaw.  \"No; someone took my cap and doublet away, sir.\"  Robin Hood frowned.  \"Who was it?\" he cried angrily.  \"Find out, John, and he shall have a bowstring about his back.  Point out the man who stripped you, my little lad,\" he continued, turning to the boy.  \"It wasn't a man,\" said the little fellow, \"but a boy who minds pigs.\"  \"What, a young swineherd!\" cried the outlaw, laughing.  \"Why did you let him?  Why didn't you fight for your clothes like a man?\"  \"I did,\" said young Robin stoutly; \"but he was so big, he knocked me down and sat upon me.\"  \"Oh! that makes all the difference.  How big was he--big as this man?\"  Young Robin glanced at the giant who had caught him, and shook his head.  \"No,\" he said; \"not half, so big as he is.  But he was stronger than I am.\"  \"So I suppose. Well, bring him along. Little John, and let's see if the women can find him some clothes and a cap.  You would like something more to wear, wouldn't you?\"  \"I should like something to eat,\"' said the boy sadly.  \"I have not had anything since breakfast.\"  \"That's not so very long,\" said Robin Hood. \"We have not had anything since breakfast.\"  \"But I mean since breakfast yesterday,\" said young Robin piteously.  \"What!\" cried Little John. \"Why, the poor boy's starved.  But we can soon mend that.  Come here!\"  Young Robin's first movement was to shrink from the big fellow, but he smiled down in such a bluff, amiable way, that the boy gave him his hands, and in an instant he was swung up and sitting six feet in the air upon the great fellow's shoulder, and then rode off to an open-fronted shed-like place thatched with reeds, Robin Hood, with his bow over his shoulder, walking by the side.  \"Here, Marian,\" cried the outlaw, and young Robin's heart gave a throb and he made a movement to get down to go to the sweet-faced woman who came hurriedly out, wide-eyed and wondering, in her green kirtle, her long soft naturally curling hair rippling down her back, but confined round her brow by a plain silver band in which a few woodland flowers were placed.  \"Oh! Robin,\" she cried, flushing with pleasure; \"who is this?\"  \"It is some one for you to take care of,\" said the outlaw, who smiled at the bright look in the girl's face.  \"He is both hungry and tired, and his people ran away and left him alone in the forest.\"  \"Oh, my dear!\" she cried, as Little John lightly jumped the boy down at her feet.  \"Come along.\"  Young Robin put his hand in hers and gave her a look full of trust and confidence, before turning to the two men, for all his troubles seemed over now.  \"Thank you for bringing me here,\" he said; \"but are you bold Robin Hood and Little John, of whom I've heard my father talk?\"  \"I daresay we are the men he has talked about,\" said the outlaw smiling; \"but who is your father, and what did he say?\"  \"My father is the Sheriff of Nottingham,\" said the boy, \"and he said that he was going to catch you and your men some day, for you were very wicked and bad.  But he did not know how good and kind you are, and I shall tell him when you send me home.\"  The two men exchanged glances with Maid Marian.  \"We shall see,\" said the outlaw; \"but you are nearly starved, aren't you?\"  \"Yes, very, very hungry,\" said the boy, looking piteously at his new protector, whose hand he held.  \"Hungry?\" she cried.  \"Yes, he has had nothing since yesterday morning; but you can cure that.\"  \"Oh, my dear, my dear!\" cried the woman.  And she hurried young Robin beneath the shelter, and in a very short time he was smiling up in her face in his thankfulness, for she had placed before him a bowl of sweet new milk and some of the nicest bread he had ever tasted.  As he ate hungrily he had to answer Maid Marian's questions about who he was and how he came there, which he did readily, and it did not strike him as being very dreadful that the mules and their loads had been seized, for old David had been very cross and severe with him for getting tired, and these people in the forest were most kind.     CHAPTER IV  It was a very strange life for a boy who had been accustomed to every comfort, but young Robin enjoyed it, for everything seemed to be so new and fresh, and the men treated him as if he had come to them for the purpose of being made into a pet.  They were, of course, fierce outlaws and robbers, ready to turn their bows and swords against anyone; but the poor people who lived in and about the forest liked and helped them, for Robin Hood's men never did them harm, while as to young Robin, they were all eager to take him out with them and show him the wonders of the forest.  On the second day after his arrival in the camp, the boy asked when he was to be shown the way home, and he asked again on the third day, but only to be told each time that he should go soon.  On the fourth day he forgot to ask, for he was busy with big Little John, who smiled with satisfaction when young Robin chose to stay with him instead of going with some of the men into the forest after a deer.  Young Robin forgot to ask when he was to be shown the way home, because Little John had promised to make him a bow and arrows and to teach him how to use them.  The great tall outlaw kept his word too, and long before evening he hung a cap upon a broken bough of an oak tree and set young Robin to work about twenty yards away shooting arrows at the mark.  \"You've got to hit that every time you shoot,\" said Little John; \"and when you can do that at twenty yards you have got to do it at forty.  Now begin.\"  For the bow was ready and made of a piece of yew, and half a dozen arrows had been finished.  \"Think you can hit it?\" said Little John, after showing the boy how to string his bow and fit the notch of the arrow to the string.  \"Oh! yes,\" said Robin confidently.  \"That's right! then you will soon be able to kill a deer.\"  \"But I don't want to kill a deer,\" said the boy.  \"I want to see some, but I shouldn't like to kill one.\"  \"Wait till you're hungry, my fine fellow,\" said Little John, laughing.  \"But my word! you look fine this morning; just like one of us.  Did Maid Marian make you that green jerkin?\"  \"Yes,\" said the boy.  \"That's right; so's your cap and feather.  But now then, try if you can hit the cap.  Draw the arrow right to the head before you let it go.  My word, what funny little fumbling fingers yours are!\"  \"Are they?\" cried Robin, who thought that his teacher's hands were the biggest he had ever seen.  \"Like babies' fingers,\" said Little John, smiling down at the boy as if very much amused.  \"Now then, draw right to the head.\"  \"I can't,\" said the boy; \"it's so hard.\"  \"That's because you are not used to it, little one.  Try again. Hold tight, and pull hard.  Steadily.  That's the way.  Now loose it and let it go.\"  Young Robin did as he was told, and away went the arrow down between the trees, to fall with its feathered wings just showing above the fallen leaves.  \"That didn't hit the cap,\" said Little John.  \"Never went near.\"  Young Robin shook his head.  \"Did you look at the cap when you loosed the arrow?\"  \"No,\" said Robin; \"I shut my eyes.\"  \"Try again then, and keep them open.\"  Robin tried and tried again till he had sent off all six of his shafts, and then he stood and looked up at Little John, and Little John looked down at him.  \"You couldn't kill a deer for dinner to-day,\" said the big fellow.  \"No,\" said young Robin; \"it's so hard.  Could you have hit it?\"  \"I think I could if I stood ten times as far away,\" said the great fellow quietly.  \"Oh, do try, please,\" cried Robin.  \"Very well; only let's pick up your arrows first, or we may lose some of them.  Always pick up your"]]]
