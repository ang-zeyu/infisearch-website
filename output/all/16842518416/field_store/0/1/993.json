My late wife's sister came here last Tuesday, and we gave her the room from which Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet. She had with her a very old-fashioned brooch, containing a miniature of her father, and set in front with three very fine brilliants and a few smaller stones. Here we are, though, at the Croft. I'll tell you the rest indoors.\"  Hewitt laid his hand on the baronet's arm. \"Don't pull up, Sir James,\" he said. \"Drive a little farther. I should like to have a general idea of the whole case before we go in.\"  \"Very good!\" Sir James Norris straightened the horse's head again and went on. \"Late yesterday afternoon, as my sister-in-law was changing her dress, she left her room for a moment to speak to my daughter in her room, almost adjoining. She was gone no more than three minutes, or five at most, but on her return the brooch, which had been left on the table, had gone. Now the window was shut fast, and had not been tampered with. Of course the door was open, but so was my daughter's, and anybody walking near must have been heard. But the strangest circumstance, and one that almost makes me wonder whether I have been awake to-day or not, was that there lay _a used match_ on the very spot, as nearly as possible, where the brooch had been--and it was broad daylight!\"  Hewitt rubbed his nose and looked thoughtfully before him. \"Um--curious, certainly,\" he said, \"Anything else?\"  \"Nothing more than you shall see for yourself. I have had the room locked and watched till you could examine it. My sister-in-law had heard of your name, and suggested that you should be called in; so, of course, I did exactly as she wanted. That she should have lost that brooch, of all things, in my house is most unfortunate; you see, there was some small difference about the thing between my late wife and her sister when their mother died and left it. It's almost worse than the Heaths' bracelet business, and altogether I'm not pleased with things, I can assure you. See what a position it is for me! Here are three ladies, in the space of one year, robbed one after another in this mysterious fashion in my house, and I can't find the thief! It's horrible! People will be afraid to come near the place. And I can do nothing!\"  \"Ah, well, we'll see. Perhaps we had better turn back now. By-the-by, were you thinking of having any alterations or additions made to your house?\"  \"No. What makes you ask?\"  \"I think you might at least consider the question of painting and decorating, Sir James--or, say, putting up another coach-house, or something. Because I should like to be (to the servants) the architect--or the builder, if you please--come to look around. You haven't told any of them about this business?\"  \"Not a word. Nobody knows but my relatives and Lloyd. I took every precaution myself, at once. As to your little disguise, be the architect by all means, and do as you please. If you can only find this thief and put an end to this horrible state of affairs, you'll do me the greatest service I've ever asked for--and as to your fee, I'll gladly make it whatever is usual, and three hundred in addition.\"  Martin Hewitt bowed. \"You're very generous, Sir James, and you may be sure I'll do what I can. As a professional man, of course, a good fee always stimulates my interest, although this case of yours certainly seems interesting enough by itself.\"  \"Most extraordinary! Don't you think so? Here are three persons, all ladies, all in my house, two even in the same room, each successively robbed of a piece of jewelry, each from a dressing-table, and a used match left behind in every case. All in the most difficult--one would say impossible--circumstances for a thief, and yet there is no clue!\"  \"Well, we won't say that just yet, Sir James; we must see. And we must guard against any undue predisposition to consider the robberies in a lump. Here we are at the lodge gate again. Is that your gardener--the man who left the ladder by the lawn on the first occasion you spoke of?\"  Mr. Hewitt nodded in the direction of a man who was clipping a box border.  \"Yes; will you ask him anything?\"  \"No, no; at any rate, not now. Remember the building alterations. I think, if there is no objection, I will look first at the room that the lady--Mrs.----\" Hewitt looked up, inquiringly.  \"My sister-in-law? Mrs. Cazenove. Oh, yes! you shall come to her room at once.\"  \"Thank you. And I think Mrs. Cazenove had better be there.\"  They alighted, and a boy from the lodge led the horse and dog-cart away.  Mrs. Cazenove was a thin and faded, but quick and energetic, lady of middle age. She bent her head very slightly on learning Martin Hewitt's name, and said: \"I must thank you, Mr. Hewitt, for your very prompt attention. I need scarcely say that any help you can afford in tracing the thief who has my property--whoever it may be--will make me most grateful. My room is quite ready for you to examine.\"  The room was on the second floor--the top floor at that part of the building. Some slight confusion of small articles of dress was observable in parts of the room.  \"This, I take it,\" inquired Hewitt, \"is exactly as it was at the time the brooch was missed?\"  \"Precisely,\" Mrs. Cazenove answered. \"I have used another room, and put myself to some other inconveniences, to avoid any disturbance.\"  Hewitt stood before the dressing-table. \"Then this is the used match,\" he observed, \"exactly where it was found?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where was the brooch?\"  \"I should say almost on the very same spot. Certainly no more than a very few inches away.\"  Hewitt examined the match closely. \"It is burned very little,\" he remarked. \"It would appear to have gone out at once. Could you hear it struck?\"  \"I heard nothing whatever; absolutely nothing.\"  \"If you will step into Miss Norris' room now for a moment,\" Hewitt suggested, \"we will try an experiment. Tell me if you hear matches struck, and how many. Where is the match-stand?\"  The match-stand proved to be empty, but matches were found in Miss Norris' room, and the test was made. Each striking could be heard distinctly, even with one of the doors pushed to.  \"Both your own door and Miss Norris' were open, I understand; the window shut and fastened inside as it is now, and nothing but the brooch was disturbed?\"  \"Yes, that was so.\"  \"Thank you, Mrs. Cazenove. I don't think I need trouble you any further just at present. I think, Sir James,\" Hewitt added, turning to the baronet, who was standing by the door----\"I think we will see the other room and take a walk outside the house, if you please. I suppose, by the by, that there is no getting at the matches left behind on the first and second occasions?\"  \"No,\" Sir James answered. \"Certainly not here. The Scotland Yard man may have kept his.\"  The room that Mrs. Armitage had occupied presented no peculiar feature. A few feet below the window the roof of the billiard-room was visible, consisting largely of skylight. Hewitt glanced casually about the walls, ascertained that the furniture and hangings had not been materially changed since the second robbery, and expressed his desire to see the windows from the outside. Before leaving the room, however, he wished to know the names of any persons who were known to have been about the house on the occasions of all three robberies.  \"Just carry your mind back, Sir James,\" he said. \"Begin with yourself, for instance. Where were you at these times?\"  \"When Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet, I was in Tagley Wood all the afternoon. When Mrs. Armitage was robbed, I believe I was somewhere about the place most of the time she was out. Yesterday I was down at the farm.\" Sir James' face broadened. \"I don't know whether you call those suspicious movements,\" he added, and laughed.  \"Not at all; I only asked you so that, remembering your own movements, you might the better recall those of the rest of the household. Was anybody, to your knowledge--_anybody_, mind--in the house on all three occasions?\"  \"Well, you know, it's quite impossible to answer for all the servants. You'll only get that by direct questioning--I can't possibly remember things of that sort. As to the family and visitors--why, you don't suspect any of them, do you?\"  \"I don't suspect a soul, Sir James,\" Hewitt answered, beaming genially, \"not a soul. You see, I can't suspect people till I know something about where they were. It's quite possible there will be independent evidence enough as it is, but you must help me if you can. The visitors, now. Was there any visitor here each time--or even on the first and last occasions only?\"  \"No, not one. And my own sister, perhaps you will be pleased to know, was only there at the time of the first robbery.\"  \"Just so! And your daughter, as I have gathered, was clearly absent from the spot each time--indeed, was in company with the party robbed. Your niece, now?\"  \"Why hang it all, Mr. Hewitt, I can't talk of my niece as a suspected criminal! The poor girl's under my protection, and I really can't allow----\"  Hewitt raised his hand, and shook his head deprecatingly.  \"My dear sir, haven't I said that I don't suspect a soul? _Do_ let me know how the people were distributed, as nearly as possible. Let me see. It was your, niece, I think, who found that Mrs. Armitage's door was locked--this door, in fact--on the day she lost her brooch?\"  \"Yes, it was.\"  \"Just so--at the time when Mrs. Armitage herself had forgotten whether she locked it or not. And yesterday--was she out then?\"  \"No, I think not. Indeed, she goes out very little--her health is usually bad. She was indoors, too, at the time of the Heath robbery, since you ask. But come, now, I don't like this. It's ridiculous to suppose that _she_ knows anything of it.\"  \"I don't suppose it, as I have said. I am only asking for information. That is all your resident family, I take it, and you know nothing of anybody else's movements--except, perhaps, Mr. Lloyd's?\"  \"L"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11252"],["title","Martin Hewitt, Investigator (#3)"],["body","loyd? Well, you know yourself that he was out with the ladies when the first robbery took place. As to the others, I don't remember. Yesterday he was probably in his room, writing. I think that acquits _him_, eh?\" Sir James looked quizzically into the broad face of the affable detective, who smiled and replied:  \"Oh, of course nobody can be in two places at once, else what would become of the _alibi_ as an institution? But, as I have said, I am only setting my facts in order. Now, you see, we get down to the servants--unless some stranger is the party wanted. Shall we go outside now?\"  Lenton Croft was a large, desultory sort of house, nowhere more than three floors high, and mostly only two. It had been added to bit by bit, till it zigzagged about its site, as Sir James Norris expressed it, \"like a game of dominoes.\" Hewitt scrutinized its external features carefully as they strolled around, and stopped some little while before the windows of the two bed-rooms he had just seen from the inside. Presently they approached the stables and coach-house, where a groom was washing the wheels of the dog-cart.  \"Do you mind my smoking?\" Hewitt asked Sir James. \"Perhaps you will take a cigar yourself--they are not so bad, I think. I will ask your man for a light.\"  Sir James felt for his own match-box, but Hewitt had gone, and was lighting his cigar with a match from a box handed him by the groom. A smart little terrier was trotting about by the coach-house, and Hewitt stooped to rub its head. Then he made some observation about the dog, which enlisted the groom's interest, and was soon absorbed in a chat with the man. Sir James, waiting a little way off, tapped the stones rather impatiently with his foot, and presently moved away.  For full a quarter of an hour Hewitt chatted with the groom, and, when at last he came away and overtook Sir James, that gentleman was about re-entering the house.  \"I beg your pardon, Sir James,\" Hewitt said, \"for leaving you in that unceremonious fashion to talk to your groom, but a dog, Sir James--a good dog--will draw me anywhere.\"  \"Oh!\" replied Sir James, shortly.  \"There is one other thing,\" Hewitt went on, disregarding the other's curtness, \"that I should like to know: There are two windows directly below that of the room occupied yesterday by Mrs. Cazenove--one on each floor. What rooms do they light?\"  \"That on the ground floor is the morning-room; the other is Mr. Lloyd's--my secretary. A sort of study or sitting-room.\"  \"Now you will see at once, Sir James,\" Hewitt pursued, with an affable determination to win the baronet back to good-humor--\"you will see at once that, if a ladder had been used in Mrs. Heath's case, anybody looking from either of these rooms would have seen it.\"  \"Of course! The Scotland Yard man questioned everybody as to that, but nobody seemed to have been in either of the rooms when the thing occurred; at any rate, nobody saw anything.\"  \"Still, I think I should like to look out of those windows myself; it will, at least, give me an idea of what _was_ in view and what was not, if anybody had been there.\"  Sir James Norris led the way to the morning-room. As they reached the door a young lady, carrying a book and walking very languidly, came out. Hewitt stepped aside to let her pass, and afterward said interrogatively: \"Miss Norris, your daughter, Sir James?\"  \"No, my niece. Do you want to ask her anything? Dora, my dear,\" Sir James added, following her in the corridor, \"this is Mr. Hewitt, who is investigating these wretched robberies for me. I think he would like to hear if you remember anything happening at any of the three times.\"  The lady bowed slightly, and said in a plaintive drawl: \"I, uncle? Really, I don't remember anything; nothing at all.\"  \"You found Mrs. Armitage's door locked, I believe,\" asked Hewitt, \"when you tried it, on the afternoon when she lost her brooch?\"  \"Oh, yes; I believe it was locked. Yes, it was.\"  \"Had the key been left in?\"  \"The key? Oh, no! I think not; no.\"  \"Do you remember anything out of the common happening--anything whatever, no matter how trivial--on the day Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet?\"  \"No, really, I don't. I can't remember at all.\"  \"Nor yesterday?\"  \"No, nothing. I don't remember anything.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Hewitt, hastily; \"thank you. Now the morning-room, Sir James.\"  In the morning-room Hewitt stayed but a few seconds, doing little more than casually glance out of the windows. In the room above he took a little longer time. It was a comfortable room, but with rather effeminate indications about its contents. Little pieces of draped silk-work hung about the furniture, and Japanese silk fans decorated the mantel-piece. Near the window was a cage containing a gray parrot, and the writing-table was decorated with two vases of flowers.  \"Lloyd makes himself pretty comfortable, eh?\" Sir James observed. \"But it isn't likely anybody would be here while he was out, at the time that bracelet went.\"  \"No,\" replied Hewitt, meditatively. \"No, I suppose not.\"  He stared thoughtfully out of the window, and then, still deep in thought, rattled at the wires of the cage with a quill toothpick and played a moment with the parrot. Then, looking up at the window again, he said: \"That is Mr. Lloyd, isn't it, coming back in a fly?\"  \"Yes, I think so. Is there anything else you would care to see here?\"  \"No, thank you,\" Hewitt replied; \"I don't think there is.\"  They went down to the smoking-room, and Sir James went away to speak to his secretary. When he returned, Hewitt said quietly: \"I think, Sir James--I _think_ that I shall be able to give you your thief presently.\"  \"What! Have you a clue? Who do you think? I began to believe you were hopelessly stumped.\"  \"Well, yes. I have rather a good clue, although I can't tell you much about it just yet. But it is so good a clue that I should like to know now whether you are determined to prosecute when you have the criminal?\"  \"Why, bless me, of course,\" Sir James replied, with surprise. \"It doesn't rest with me, you know--the property belongs to my friends. And even if they were disposed to let the thing slide, I shouldn't allow it--I couldn't, after they had been robbed in my house.\"  \"Of course, of course! Then, if I can, I should like to send a message to Twyford by somebody perfectly trustworthy--not a servant. Could anybody go?\"  \"Well, there's Lloyd, although he's only just back from his journey. But, if it's important, he'll go.\"  \"It is important. The fact is we must have a policeman or two here this evening, and I'd like Mr. Lloyd to fetch them without telling anybody else.\"  Sir James rang, and, in response to his message, Mr. Lloyd appeared. While Sir James gave his secretary his instructions, Hewitt strolled to the door of the smoking-room, and intercepted the latter as he came out.  \"I'm sorry to give you this trouble, Mr. Lloyd,\" he said, \"but I must stay here myself for a little, and somebody who can be trusted must go. Will you just bring back a police-constable with you? or rather two--two would be better. That is all that is wanted. You won't let the servants know, will you? Of course there will be a female searcher at the Twyford police-station? Ah--of course. Well, you needn't bring her, you know. That sort of thing is done at the station.\" And, chatting thus confidentially, Martin Hewitt saw him off.  When Hewitt returned to the smoking-room, Sir James said, suddenly: \"Why, bless my soul, Mr. Hewitt, we haven't fed you! I'm awfully sorry. We came in rather late for lunch, you know, and this business has bothered me so I clean forgot everything else. There's no dinner till seven, so you'd better let me give you something now. I'm really sorry. Come along.\"  \"Thank you, Sir James,\" Hewitt replied; \"I won't take much. A few biscuits, perhaps, or something of that sort. And, by the by, if you don't mind, I rather think I should like to take it alone. The fact is I want to go over this case thoroughly by myself. Can you put me in a room?\"  \"Any room you like. Where will you go? The dining-room's rather large, but there's my study, that's pretty snug, or----\"  \"Perhaps I can go into Mr. Lloyd's room for half an hour or so; I don't think he'll mind, and it's pretty comfortable.\"  \"Certainly, if you'd like. I'll tell them to send you whatever they've got.\"  \"Thank you very much. Perhaps they'll also send me a lump of sugar and a walnut; it's--it's a little fad of mine.\"  \"A--what? A lump of sugar and a walnut?\" Sir James stopped for a moment, with his hand on the bell-rope. \"Oh, certainly, if you'd like it; certainly,\" he added, and stared after this detective with curious tastes as he left the room.  When the vehicle, bringing back the secretary and the policeman, drew up on the drive, Martin Hewitt left the room on the first floor and proceeded down-stairs. On the landing he met Sir James Norris and Mrs. Cazenove, who stared with astonishment on perceiving that the detective carried in his hand the parrot-cage.  \"I think our business is about brought to a head now,\" Hewitt remarked, on the stairs. \"Here are the police officers from Twyford.\" The men were standing in the hall with Mr. Lloyd, who, on catching sight of the cage in Hewitt's hand, paled suddenly.  \"This is the person who will be charged, I think,\" Hewitt pursued, addressing the officers, and indicating Lloyd with his finger.  \"What, Lloyd?\" gasped Sir James, aghast. \"No--not Lloyd--nonsense!\"  \"He doesn't seem to think it nonsense himself, does he?\" Hewitt placidly observed. Lloyd had sank on a chair, and, gray of face, was staring blindly at the man he had run against at the office door that morning. His lips moved in spasms, but there was no sound. The wilted flower fell from his button-hole to the floor, but he did not move.  \"This is his accomplice,\" Hewitt went on, placing the parrot and cage on the hall table, \"though I doubt whether there will be any use in charging _him_. Eh, Polly?\"  The parrot"]]]
