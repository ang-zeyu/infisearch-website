Spring had revamped her ageless fripperies of tender leaves and bird-cries and sweet, warm odours for the adornment of this meadow; above it she had set a turkis sky splashed here and there with little clouds that were like whipped cream; and upon it she had scattered largesse, a DanaÃ«'s shower of buttercups. Altogether, she had made of it a particularly dangerous meadow for a man and a maid to frequent.  Yet there Mr. Woods paused under a burgeoning maple--paused resolutely, with the lures of Spring thick about him, compassed with every snare of scent and sound and colour that the witch is mistress of.  Margaret hoped he had a pleasant passage over. Her father, thank you, was in the pink of condition. Oh, yes, she was quite well. She hoped Mr. Woods would not find America--  \"Well, Peggy,\" said Mr. Woods, \"then, we'll have it out right here.\"  His insolence was so surprising that--in order to recover herself--Margaret actually sat down under the maple-tree. Peggy, indeed! Why, she hadn't been called Peggy for--no, not for four whole years!  \"Because I intend to be friends, you know,\" said Mr. Woods.  And about them the maple-leaves made a little island of sombre green, around which more vivid grasses rippled and dimpled under the fitful spring breezes. And everywhere leaves lisped to one another, and birds shrilled insistently. It was a perilous locality.  I fancy Billy Woods was out of his head when he suggested being friends in such a place. Friends, indeed!--you would have thought from the airy confidence with which he spoke that Margaret had come safely to forty year and wore steel-rimmed spectacles!  But Miss Hugonin merely cast down her eyes and was aware of no reason why they shouldn't be. She was sure he must be hungry, and she thought luncheon must be ready by now.  In his soul, Mr. Woods observed that her lashes were long--long beyond all reason. Lacking the numbers that Petrarch flowed in, he did not venture, even to himself, to characterise them further. But oh, how queer it was they should be pure gold at the roots!--she must have dipped them in the ink-pot. And oh, the strong, sudden, bewildering curve of 'em! He could not recall at the present moment ever noticing quite such lashes anywhere else. No, it was highly improbable that there were such lashes anywhere else. Perhaps a few of the superior angels might have such lashes. He resolved for the future to attend church more regularly.  Aloud, Mr. Woods observed that in that case they had better shake hands.  It would have been ridiculous to contest the point. The dignified course was to shake hands, since he insisted on it, and then to return at once to Selwoode.  Margaret Hugonin had a pretty hand, and Mr. Woods, as an artist, could not well fail to admire it. Still, he needn't have looked at it as though he had never before seen anything quite like it; he needn't have neglected to return it; and when Miss Hugonin reclaimed it, after a decent interval, he needn't have laughed in a manner that compelled her to laugh, too. These things were unnecessary and annoying, as they caused Margaret to forget that she despised him.  [Illustration: \"Then, for no apparent reason, Margaret flushed, and Billy ... thought it vastly becoming\"]  For the time being--will you believe it?--she actually thought he was rather nice.  \"I acted like an ass,\" said Mr. Woods, tragically. \"Oh, yes, I did, you know. But if you'll forgive me for having been an ass I'll forgive you for throwing me over for Teddy Anstruther, and at the wedding I'll dance through any number of pairs of patent-leathers you choose to mention.\"  So that was the way he looked at it. Teddy Anstruther, indeed! Why, Teddy was a dark little man with brown eyes--just the sort of man she most objected to. How could any one ever possibly fancy a brown-eyed man? Then, for no apparent reason, Margaret flushed, and Billy, who had stretched his great length of limb on the grass beside her, noted it with a pair of the bluest eyes in the world and thought it vastly becoming.  \"Billy,\" said she, impulsively--and the name having slipped out once by accident, it would have been absurd to call him anything else afterward--\"it was horrid of you to refuse to take any of that money.\"  \"But I didn't want it,\" he protested. \"Good Lord, I'd only have done something foolish with it. It was awfully square of you, Peggy, to offer to divide, but I didn't want it, you see. I don't want to be a millionaire, and give up the rest of my life to founding libraries and explaining to people that if they never spend any money on amusements they'll have a great deal by the time they're too old to enjoy it. I'd rather paint pictures.\"  So that I think Margaret must have endeavoured at some time to make him accept part of Frederick R. Woods's money.  \"You make me feel--and look--like a thief,\" she reproved him.  Then Billy laughed a little. \"You don't look in the least like one,\" he reassured her. \"You look like an uncommonly honest, straightforward young woman,\" Mr. Woods added, handsomely, \"and I don't believe you'd purloin under the severest temptation.\"  She thanked him for his testimonial, with all three dimples in evidence.  This was unsettling. He hedged.  \"Except, perhaps--\" said he.  \"Yes?\" queried Margaret, after a pause.  However, she questioned him with her head drooped forward, her brows raised; and as this gave him the full effect of her eyes, Mr. Woods became quite certain that there was, at least, one thing she might be expected to rob him of, and wisely declined to mention it.  Margaret did not insist on knowing what it was. Perhaps she heard it thumping under his waistcoat, where it was behaving very queerly.  So they sat in silence for a while. Then Margaret fell a-humming to herself; and the air--will you believe it?--chanced by the purest accident to be that foolish, senseless old song they used to sing together four years ago.  Billy chuckled. \"Let's!\" he obscurely pleaded.  Spring prompted her.    \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy?\" queried Margaret's wonderful contralto,    \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy?   Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?\"  She sang it in a low, hushed voice, just over her breath. Not looking at him, however. And oh, what a voice! thought Billy Woods. A voice that was honey and gold and velvet and all that is most sweet and rich and soft in the world! Find me another voice like that, you _prime donne!_ Find me a simile for it, you uninventive poets! Indeed, I'd like to see you do it.  But he chimed in, nevertheless, with his pleasant throaty baritone, and lilted his own part quite creditably.    \"I've been to seek a wife,   She's the joy of my life;   She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother\"--  Only Billy sang it \"father,\" just as they used to do.  And then they sang it through, did Margaret and Billy--sang of the dimple in her chin and the ringlets in her hair, and of the cherry pies she achieved with such celerity--sang as they sat in the spring-decked meadow every word of that inane old song that is so utterly senseless and so utterly unforgettable.  It was a quite idiotic performance. I set it down to the snares of Spring--to her insidious, delightful snares of scent and sound and colour that--for the moment, at least--had trapped these young people into loving life infinitely.  But I wonder who is responsible for that tatter of rhyme and melody that had come to them from nowhere in particular? Mr. Woods, as he sat up at the conclusion of the singing vigorously to applaud, would have shared his last possession, his ultimate crust, with that unknown benefactor of mankind. Indeed, though, the heart of Mr. Woods just now was full of loving kindness and capable of any freakish magnanimity.  For--will it be believed?--Mr. Woods, who four years ago had thrown over a fortune and exiled himself from his native land, rather than propose marriage to Margaret Hugonin, had no sooner come again into her presence and looked once into her perfectly fathomless eyes than he could no more have left her of his own accord than a moth can turn his back to a lighted candle. He had fancied himself entirely cured of that boy-and-girl nonsense; his broken heart, after the first few months, had not interfered in the least with a naturally healthy appetite; and, behold, here was the old malady raging again in his veins and with renewed fervour.  And all because the girl had a pretty face! I think you will agree with me that in the conversation I have recorded Margaret had not displayed any great wisdom or learning or tenderness or wit, nor, in fine, any of the qualities a man might naturally look for in a helpmate. Yet at the precise moment he handed his baggage-check to the groom, Mr. Woods had made up his mind to marry her. In an instant he had fallen head over ears in love; or to whittle accuracy to a point, he had discovered that he had never fallen out of love; and if you had offered him an empress or fetched Helen of Troy from the grave for his delectation he would have laughed you to scorn.  In his defense, I can only plead that Margaret was an unusually beautiful woman. It is all very well to flourish a death's-head at the feast, and bid my lady go paint herself an inch thick, for to this favour she must come; and it is quite true that the reddest lips in the universe may give vent to slander and lies, and the brightest eyes be set in the dullest head, and the most roseate of complexions be purchased at the corner drug-store; but, say what you will, a pretty woman is a pretty woman, and while she continue so no amount of common-sense or experience will prevent a man, on provocation, from alluring, coaxing, even entreating her to make a fool of him. We like it. And I think they like it, too.  So Mr. Woods lost his heart on a fine spring morning and was unreasonably elated over the fact."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10882"],["title","The Eagle's Shadow (#5)"],["body","  And Margaret? Margaret was content.    V  They talked for a matter of a half-hour in the fashion aforetime recorded--not very wise nor witty talk, if you will, but very pleasant to make. There were many pauses. There was much laughter over nothing in particular. There were any number of sentences ambitiously begun that ended nowhere. Altogether, it was just the sort of talk for a man and a maid.  Yet some twenty minutes later, Mr. Woods, preparing for luncheon in the privacy of his chamber, gave a sudden exclamation. Then he sat down and rumpled his hair thoroughly.  \"Good Lord!\" he groaned; \"I'd forgotten all about that damned money! Oh, you ass!--you abject ass! Why, she's one of the richest women in America, and you're only a fifth-rate painter with a paltry thousand or so a year! _You_ marry her!--why, I dare say she's refused a hundred better men than you! She'd think you were mad! Why, she'd think you were after her money! She--oh, she'd only think you a precious cheeky ass, she would, and she'd be quite right. You _are_ an ass, Billy Woods! You ought to be locked up in some nice quiet stable, where your heehawing wouldn't disturb people. You need a keeper, you do!\"  He sat for some ten minutes, aghast. Afterward he rose and threw back his shoulders and drew a deep breath.  \"No, we aren't an ass,\" he addressed his reflection in the mirror, as he carefully knotted his tie. \"We're only a poor chuckle-headed moth who's been looking at a star too long. It's a bright star, Billy, but it isn't for you. So we're going to be sensible now. We're going to get a telegram to-morrow that will call us away from Selwoode. We aren't coming back any more, either. We're simply going to continue painting fifth-rate pictures, and hoping that some day she'll find the right man and be very, very happy.\"  Nevertheless, he decided that a blue tie would look better, and was very particular in arranging it.  At the same moment Margaret stood before her mirror and tidied her hair for luncheon and assured her image in the glass that she was a weak-minded fool. She pointed out to herself the undeniable fact that Billy, having formerly refused to marry her--oh, ignominy!--seemed pleasant-spoken enough, now that she had become an heiress. His refusal to accept part of her fortune was a very flimsy device; it simply meant he hoped to get all of it. Oh, he did, did he!  Margaret powdered her nose viciously.  _She_ saw through him! His honest bearing she very plainly perceived to be the result of consummate hypocrisy. In his laughter her keen ear detected a hollow ring; and his courteous manner she found, at bottom, mere servility. And finally she demonstrated--to her own satisfaction, at least--that his charm of manner was of exactly the, same sort that had been possessed by many other eminently distinguished criminals.  How did she do this? My dear sir, you had best inquire of your mother or your sister or your wife, or any other lady that your fancy dictates. They know. I am sure I don't.  And after it all--  \"Oh, dear, dear!\" said Margaret; \"I _do_ wish he didn't have such nice eyes!\"    VI  On the way to luncheon Mr. Woods came upon AdÃ¨le Haggage and Hugh Van Orden, both of whom he knew, very much engrossed in one another, in a nook under the stairway. To Billy it seemed just now quite proper that every one should be in love; wasn't it--after all--the most pleasant condition in the world? So he greeted them with a semi-paternal smile that caused AdÃ¨le to flush a little.  For she was--let us say, interested--in Mr. Van Orden. That was tolerably well known. In fact, Margaret--prompted by Mrs. Haggage, it must be confessed--had invited him to Selwoode for the especial purpose of entertaining Miss AdÃ¨le Haggage; for he was a good match, and Mrs. Haggage, as an experienced chaperon, knew the value of country houses. Very unexpectedly, however, the boy had developed a disconcerting tendency to fall in love with Margaret, who snubbed him promptly and unmercifully. He had accordingly fallen back on AdÃ¨le, and Mrs. Haggage had regained both her trust in Providence and her temper.  In the breakfast-room, where luncheon was laid out, the Colonel greeted Mr. Woods with the enthusiasm a sailor shipwrecked on a desert island might conceivably display toward the boat-crew come to rescue him. The Colonel liked Billy; and furthermore, the poor Colonel's position at Selwoode just now was not utterly unlike that of the suppositious mariner; were I minded to venture into metaphor, I should picture him as clinging desperately to the rock of an old fogeyism and surrounded by weltering seas of advanced thought. Colonel Hugonin himself was not advanced in his ideas. Also, he had forceful opinions as to the ultimate destination of those who were.  Then Billy was presented to the men of the party--Mr. Felix Kennaston and Mr. Petheridge Jukesbury. Mrs. Haggage he knew slightly; and Kathleen Saumarez he had known very well indeed, some six years previously, before she had ever heard of Miguel Saumarez, and when Billy was still an undergraduate. She was a widow now, and not well-to-do; and Mr. Woods's first thought on seeing her was that a man was a fool to write verses, and that she looked like just the sort of woman to preserve them.  His second was that he had verged on imbecility when he fancied he admired that slender, dark-haired type. A woman's hair ought to be an enormous coronal of sunlight; a woman ought to have very large, candid eyes of a colour between that of sapphires and that of the spring heavens, only infinitely more beautiful than either; and all petticoated persons differing from this description were manifestly quite unworthy of any serious consideration.  So his eyes turned to Margaret, who had no eyes for him. She had forgotten his existence, with an utterness that verged on ostentation; and if it had been any one else Billy would have surmised she was in a temper. But that angel in a temper!--nonsense! And, oh, what eyes she had! and what lashes! and what hair!--and altogether, how adorable she was, and what a wonder the admiring gods hadn't snatched her up to Olympus long ago!  Thus far Mr. Woods.  But if Miss Hugonin was somewhat taciturn, her counsellors in divers schemes for benefiting the universe were in opulent vein. Billy heard them silently.  \"I have spent the entire morning by the lake,\" Mr. Kennaston informed the party at large, \"in company with a mocking-bird who was practising a new aria. It was a wonderful place; the trees were lisping verses to themselves, and the sky overhead was like a robin's egg in colour, and a faint wind was making tucks and ruches and pleats all over the water, quite as if the breezes had set up in business as mantua-makers. I fancy they thought they were working on a great sheet of blue silk, for it was very like that. And every once in a while a fish would leap and leave a splurge of bubble and foam behind that you would have sworn was an inserted lace medallion.\"  Mr. Kennaston, as you are doubtless aware, is the author of \"The King's Quest\" and other volumes of verse. He is a full-bodied young man, with hair of no particular shade; and if his green eyes are a little aged, his manner is very youthful. His voice in speaking is wonderfully pleasing, and he has a habit of cocking his head on one side, in a bird-like fashion.  \"Indeed,\" Mr. Petheridge Jukesbury observed, \"it is very true that God made the country and man made the town. A little more wine, please.\"  Mr. Jukesbury is a prominent worker in the cause of philanthropy and temperance. He is ponderous and bland; and for the rest, he is president of the Society for the Suppression of Nicotine and the Nude, vice-president of the Anti-Inebriation League, secretary of the Incorporated Brotherhood of Benevolence, and the bearer of divers similar honours.  \"I am never really happy in the country,\" Mrs. Saumarez dissented; \"it reminds me so constantly of our rural drama. I am always afraid the quartette may come on and sing something.\"  Kathleen Eppes Saumarez, as I hope you do not need to be told, is the well-known lecturer before women's clubs, and the author of many sympathetic stories of Nature and animal life of the kind that have had such a vogue of late. There was always an indefinable air of pathos about her; as Hunston Wyke put it, one felt, somehow, that her mother had been of a domineering disposition, and that she took after her father.  \"Ah, dear lady,\" Mr. Kennaston cried, playfully, \"you, like many of us, have become an alien to Nature in your quest of a mere Earthly Paradox. Epigrams are all very well, but I fancy there is more happiness to be derived from a single impulse from a vernal wood than from a whole problem-play of smart sayings. So few of us are natural,\" Mr. Kennaston complained, with a dulcet sigh; \"we are too sophisticated. Our very speech lacks the tang of outdoor life. Why should we not love Nature--the great mother, who is, I grant you, the necessity of various useful inventions, in her angry moods, but who, in her kindly moments--\" He paused, with a wry face. \"I beg your pardon,\" said he, \"but I believe I've caught rheumatism lying by that confounded pond.\"  Mrs. Saumarez rallied the poet, with a pale smile. \"That comes of communing with Nature,\" she reminded him; \"and it serves you rightly, for natural communications corrupt good epigrams. I prefer Nature with wide margins and uncut leaves,\" she spoke, in her best platform manner. \"Art should be an expurgated edition of Nature, with all the unpleasant parts left out. And I am sure,\" Mrs. Saumarez added, handsomely, and clinching her argument, \"that Mr. Kennaston gives us much better sunsets in his poems than I have ever seen in the west.\"  He acknowledged this with a bow.  \"Not sherry--claret, if you please,\" said Mr. Jukesbury. \"Art should be an expurgated edition of Nature,\" he repeated, with a suave chuckle. \"Do you know, I consider that admirably put, Mrs. "]]]
