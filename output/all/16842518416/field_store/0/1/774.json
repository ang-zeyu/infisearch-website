We suspected that Jack Rose and the man at our side understood more English than they pretended.  At all events, it had its effect.  In half an hour we were taken before the commissioner.  Two cigars lay on the edge of the table nearest us.  I could see at a glance that we were free.  \"Do you speak English?\" I asked him.  \"No,\" he answered in our native tongue; \"only French, Flemish, German, and Italian--but not English.\" And with a grin he asked for our passports.  \"You are for the American newspapers?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered--\"one of us is a lawyer who writes occasionally.  I am correspondent for a New York and a Boston paper, but I won't cable anything from here.\" For this reason, I explained, no movements of troops or news of military value could leak out.  \"Ah, I see,\" said the commissioner who could not talk English.  \"An amateur correspondent and a slow correspondent.  But correspondents are not at all tolerated in this province.  It is five o'clock.  You will board the train leaving this province at 5.16 P.M.\"  From Maastricht to the Dutch capital is, under usual conditions, a four-hour run to the north.  During this trip we passed encampments and fortifications of the 400,000 well-drilled but poorly equipped troops which the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in the spirit of no negative neutrality, had mobilized along her borders.  Whenever we crossed a bridge every window in the entire train was fastened down and there were strict orders against raising them.  We discovered that under the boulders were carefully concealed large charges of dynamite ready for immediate use in case of invasion--so that Horatius need not be called upon while axe and crowbar were at work.  The windows, it appears, were locked to prevent throwing out of lighted cigars or matches.  At one o'clock the next morning our train, delayed by war-time traffic, rolled into the Hague station, whence three days later, I was to start my lucky trip into Antwerp, the besieged.  Clog dancing and cognac helped to get me from The Hague back into Antwerp in time for its bombardment and capture by the German forces under General von Beseler.  I happened to perform the clog dancing at a critical moment during a trip on a Scheldt River barge, thus diverting the attention of the river sentries from my lack of proper papers.  While the pedal acrobatics were in progress my temporary friend, Mons. le Conducteur, reinforced the already genial pickets with many glasses of the warming fluid.  Willard Luther, my companion in and out of jail during the first part of the continental wanderings, was forced to leave for home the day after we got back to The Hague.  He had five days to catch the Lusitania at Liverpool.  Three of them he spent on a whirlwind trip trying to see action in northern Flanders, but, much to his disappointment, was called away before the final scrimmage at Antwerp.  If he had succeeded in getting in, I rather fear the Massachusetts Bar would have lost a valuable member.  He had an insatiable passion to be in the neighborhood of bullets and bombs-- not, as I take it, that he really wanted to get hit--merely that he would like to see how close he could come.  On October 2d, strictest regulations were passed prohibiting entry within the fortifications of Antwerp without permit from the military governor, General de Guise.  Three weeks earlier entry had been possible but difficult, and the feat was again easier after the German occupation.  But during the city's days of trial the military lid was clamped and riveted.  Except for those coming direct from England, the highest civil recommendations were valueless.  I had one of these,--a laissez-passer from Prince d'Eline, Secretary of the Belgian Legation at The Hague,--issued because of the fact that I was carrying a large packet of mail from the American Legation at The Hague to Henry W. Diederick, United States Consul-General at Antwerp.  I had also been entrusted with three hundred marks to be delivered to a German prisoner, Lieutenant Ulrici, known to have been wounded and captured in the fighting around Termonde, and believed to be lying in a hospital ship in the river or in Antwerp itself. The fact of carrying such money was of course against me as indicating German sympathy.  Because a large part of the railroad line between Eschen, Cappelen, and Antwerp had been torn up, because there would be many hold-ups, and because I couldn't speak a word of Flemish, I decided against the overland route.  Hearing, however, that L. Braakman & Company, a grain and freight shipping concern, were running down barges from Rotterdam, I got a Belgian friend to call them up on my behalf.  The result was a flat throw-down: without General de Guise's sanction I might not even cross the gangplank.  Nevertheless, I went to Rotterdam, crossed the river basin to the island from which the Braakman boats ran, and there saw a director of the company, who, fortunately, could speak both English and Flemish.  He took me to the captain of the river barge, a low craft that looked a cross between a tugboat and a Hudson River scow.  In less than three minutes my case was disposed of.  Verdict: \"C'est absolument defendu.\" It was time for a little \"bluff.\" An hour later I returned with a new proposition, having in the mean time telegraphed Mr. Diederick either to meet me at the pier at Antwerp or to send a military permit.  Displaying a copy of this telegram I suggested that I be allowed to board.  If there was any one at Antwerp to meet and vouch for me, well and good; if not, they were at liberty to ship me back.  That was my proposition.  \"He may go as far as the border patrol, fifteen miles east of Antwerp,\" the captain said to my interpreter.  \"If the river sentries permit it he may then go as far as the Antwerp pier, but he cannot land.\"  We cast off Sunday, October 4th, at 6 A.M.  The little Telegraaf III poked her nose through the blue-gray haze of a chilly October morning while the muddy waters of the Meuse slapped coldly against her bow.  I stamped the deck a few times, wondering if there was an English-speaking soul aboard, and leaned up against the engine room until the odor of coffee and bacon lured me to the fo'castle hatch.  A purple-faced giant, with thick lips that met like the halves of an English muffin blocked the companion-way.  \"'Jour,\" growled the face as though it hated to say it, then pointed to the food and cognac.  This was Monsieur le Conducteur, ship's cook, barkeeper, and collector of fares.  In the center of a dark cabin, littered with charts, pails, and Flemish newspapers, was a kitchen table.  Now and then a smoking oil lamp flared up to throw a light on the faces of my fellow-passengers, five of them in addition to the captain and Mons.  le Conducteur.  They were, as I discovered later, Mons.  A. Albrecht, a leading alderman of Antwerp and a friend of Mons. Vos, the burgomaster; a light-haired Belgian piano salesman who could speak five languages; Mile. Blanche Ravinet, of looks beautiful and occupation unknown; and two others.  From the suddenness with which the conversation stopped, I judged they had been discussing \"ze American.\" They were welcome to say what they liked barring the word \"spion.\"  For hours we chugged steadily along, catching a fair tide on the lower Meuse, and sliding past the neat little towns of Dordrecht, Papendrecht, and Willemstad, through the Hollandische Diep and the Krammer Volkerak.  After that the Telegraaf III worried through the canals and systems of locks which virtually cut the neck of Tholen from the mainland, and, when the last of these had been accomplished, splashed into the great basin of the East Scheldt.  A Dutch gunboat cut across our bows, signaling us to halt.  An officer boarded us to study the freight invoices.  Farther upstream a launch came alongside, making fast fore and aft, while two Belgian river sentries, in long blue coats and faded drab trousers, poked their bearded heads above the rail.  This, then, was what the captain meant by the border patrol.  Now, as luck would have it, the day was cold: we were the first boat to come through the locks for some hours, and apparently the river sentries had had no breakfast.  So they dove into the fo'castle, where Mons.  le Conducteur produced bread and cognac.  I at once ordered Mons.  le Conducteur to get a second round of liquid refreshment for our military guests.  Conversation flowed.  The soldiers drummed on the table to keep their hands warm and in a moment of inspiration I showed them how the darkies in our country warm their feet.  \"Clog dance,\" I explained.  \"Encore,\" shouted the piano salesman.  \"That is splendid.\"  \"Pleaz again! Oh, pleaz!\" echoed Mile.  Blanche.  \"See, every one, ze grand American foot game.\"  The fat-faced conducteur, with whom I had suddenly grown in favor, repeated the cognac treatment on the sentries.  Before I knew it, they had me alongside the table, one hand steadied against a thwart of the swaying cabin, my head in the smoke of the oil lamp, my feet pounding and kicking, as it seemed, at the very door of Antwerp.  The piano salesman shouted rag-time, Mile. Blanche drummed time on the bench, and the river sentries pounded time with their rifle butts.  \"Encore!\" they shouted when I sat down with aching legs.  All at once the launch alongside gave an angry toot, for the officer wanted his men back: there were other boats to be examined.  The sentries glanced quickly at our papers, not reading, I am sure, a word of mine, speedily cast off ropes, and disappeared guiltily and somewhat unsteadily over the larboard rail.  An hour later the Telegraaf III took the river's turn, swinging past Fort St. Philippe, until we could see the gray-blue spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame with its intricate network of stone silhouetted against the autumn sunset."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10918"],["title","The Log of a Noncombatant (#7)"],["body",". Diederick was not at the pier to meet me, nor was there a military passport from General de Guise.  \"Stay by me,\" said Alderman Albrecht.  As each of the pier sentries saluted him he said a whispered word, and apparently his word was good, for the American \"foot game\" artist was allowed to pass. Perhaps Alderman Albrecht had decided that German spies don't clog-dance.  Though not officially admitted to the besieged city, I went at once to my old stand, the Hotel St. Antoine, now converted into British Staff Headquarters.  At sundown a mist crept up from the river, and through it we heard a roar of welcome and the rumble of heavy artillery. Charging down the Avenue de Keyser came a hundred London motor-busses, Piccadilly signs and all, some filled, some half-filled, with a wet-looking bunch of Tommies, followed by armored mitrailleuses, a few 6.7 naval guns, officers' machines, commissary and ammunition carriages--the first brigade of Winston Churchill's army of relief, which for five days was destined to make so valiant, but so short, a fight against the overwhelming German army.     Chapter V  The Bombardment Of Antwerp    There was something typically British in the way those Englishmen went about the defense of Antwerp.  In the streets and barracks, and more especially at the Hotel St. Antoine, British Staff Headquarters, where I stayed until its doors were closed, I saw them at close range during that week of horror.  Once when I was eating with a company of marines near their temporary barracks, they gave me the password to the trenches, and, although I only got out as far as the inner line of forts on that day, it gave me an opportunity to observe the work of the men under long-range firing.  At the St. Antoine, ten or a dozen officers were quartered; others clanked in and out for hurried conferences in the corridors or disappeared into the smoking-room, whose heavy doors with the sign, \"Reservee pour la Gouvernement Anglaise,\" hid Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the English Admiralty, and his portmanteau of war maps.  Here was Belgium's last stronghold on the verge of downfall: the outer line of forts had already fallen; Forts Wavre, St. Catherine, Waelham, and Lierre were already prey to the Krupp mortars; the German hosts were swarming across the River Nethe, six miles to the city's south, and the cowering populace in their flight made the streets terrible to look upon.  Yet at the St. Antoine there was no particular flurry--so far, at least, as the officers were concerned.  At night they worked over their war maps; in the daytime they went out to the forts.  They would get up in the morning, an hour or two earlier than the average business man, have a comfortable breakfast, smoke a cigar for half an hour or so, and talk things over.  Then their military automobiles came trembling and sputtering to the doorsteps, and in groups of fours and fives they went out to the firing line.  If only two or three of a group returned, you would naturally have to draw your own conclusions as to the fate of the rest.  Those English gentlemen went about their jobs of life and death with the same detached coolness as if their hunters were being saddled, or they were waiting for the referee's whistle in Rugby football.  Their attitude was infernally exasperating; yet you couldn't help taking off your hat to their sublime nerve and indifference.  I overheard a typical remark when matters were in this critical state.  It came from a handsome, curly-headed officer, noticeable not only for his apparent efficiency, but because he didn't let the game of war interfere with his attentions to the little Princess de Ligne.  The latter was nursing her brother, who had been shot through the back of the neck during a raid through German lines.  She was a princess in rank, and a queen in looks.  Thirty hours before the first shell burst into the Place Verte--Monday morning, it was--this fellow rapped at my door.  He had wandered into the wrong pew, for his words were obviously intended to hurry up a brother officer with whom he was to take the morning ride to the firing line.  Sticking his curly, sunburnt head around the corner he drawled in inimitable British intonation:-  \"I say, old chap, do hurry along; this is no ORDINARY occasion, you know.\"  In the Royal Belgian Palace there happened a few hours before the bombardment an incident revealing the simplicity and kindliness of King Albert's character.  In connection with it, it is necessary to speak of Harold Fowler, a New Yorker and Columbia College graduate, who helped to save the public buildings of Antwerp, and later entered the Allied ranks as a fighter.  When the war broke out, Fowler was private secretary to Ambassador Page in London.  In November he got a commission in the Royal Horse Guards, known as the \"Blues.\" While the Germans were pressing hard on Antwerp, the German commander, as I have mentioned elsewhere, asked that a diagram of the city of Antwerp, with plans and location of the cathedral, the Hotel de Ville, and the more important works be sent to him in order that he might find the range and avoid firing on them.  Neutrals were to carry the plans through; and Fowler and Hugh Gibson, secretary to the American Minister at Brussels (Brand Whitlock), volunteered.  Two days before the bombardment Gibson went to the Royal Palace at Antwerp where General de Guise and his staff were in conference. Fowler trailed along, but, not liking to enter, walked up and down the hallway, hands in his pockets, admiring the portraits half-hidden in the darkness of the foyer.  A tall figure approached and in French asked who he was.  Fowler replied that he was an American and was waiting for Gibson.  \"I see,\" said the figure, then speaking in English, \"that you are interested in pictures.\"  \"Very much,\" answered Fowler.  \"Then, would you like to see those in the Royal Chambers upstairs?\"  Fowler hesitated, feeling like an intruder, but the figure insisted upon leading him upstairs.  When they got into the light, Fowler turned to examine his kind friend.  To his utter astonishment he saw that it was Albert, King of the Belgians!  By that time we of Antwerp were getting a very fair imitation of a city besieged.  Water supply had already been cut off for some days. There was just enough for cooking purposes; bathing and such pleasantries were out of the question--even for Royalty.  According to the French maid in my corridor, Winston Churchill managed to get a shave by ordering tea sent to his room and using the hot water for shaving lather.  Monday, October 5th, the night before the city emptied itself of non-combatants, was almost a festive occasion at the St. Antoine.  The British entry gave tremendous confidence to the stricken city and the tired Belgian soldiers--a bit of pride before the fall.  New faces turned up, friends in the English army met, shook hands, and discussed the outlook.  One was even reminded of lighter occasions, such as the Copley-Plaza in Boston or the Hotel Taft in New Haven before an annual Harvard-Yale battle.  At the head of a long table in the center of the dining-room sat the First Lord of the British Admiralty, looking rather thoughtful, his baldish head and Trinity House uniform standing out in contrast to the service uniforms of the younger men around him.  At the same table were commissary officers, sergeants, aide-de-camps, Hugh Gibson, Harold Fowler, and somewhat farther down the Russian Minister and my curly-headed officer, chatting over his coffee with little Princess de Ligne.  In the flash of an eye these scenes changed to scenes of terror.  The news leaked out, and spread like wildfire, that the Kaiser's men had crossed the River Nethe and had placed their big guns within range of the city.  It was not until forty-eight hours later that the populace saw a handful of Flemish posters pasted in out-of-the-way corners--posters signed by the Civil Government--which thanked the populace \"for retaining until the present time their praiseworthy sangfroid, and regretting that the responsibilities of their office necessitated their own removal to a neighborhood more safe.\"  Queen Elizabeth, whom danger made a democrat, walked right into my hotel, if you please, and stopped casually to say good-bye to the Russian Minister.  The crowd outside did not know she was leaving for Ostend under cover of darkness--they cheered her loudly just the same.  She is a spunky sort of queen.  Then came the flight.  You knew the fear of the Germans had got into their blood when waiters dropped their plates and dishes and ran; when shops, houses, hotels closed and the people melted away; when the French chambermaid besought with frightened eyes that Monsieur take her away to England, and when the hotel proprietor disappeared without even asking for his bill.  There were other sights that did one good to see: such as gray-haired Mrs.  Richardson, venerable figure of a British nurse, with six wars to her credit and a breastful of decorations from four different governments, who refused to leave her hospital even if it was blown to pieces, so long as there were men to help and wounds to heal.  When the St. Antoine closed I took her to the American Consulate to find a house where she could stay.  That night and the next loads of English Red Cross busses with their households of pain and ether rumbled over the pontoon bridge across the Scheldt, went past Fort Tete de Flandre, and disappeared in the swampy meadows on the road to Ghent.  I never saw her again, but I have always hoped that Mrs. Richardson was among the nurses who went with them.  When on Wednesday morning I was turned out of my room, I made my way past a pressing throng of foreign faces to the Queen's Hotel on the water front.  There I found Arthur Ruhl and James H.  Hare, who had just come over from England.  The hotel overlooked the River Scheldt, forming a wide crescent on the city's north, and was"]]]
