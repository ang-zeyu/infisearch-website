Thus, before Miss Peckham was fairly introduced, her unpopularity was already sealed. It takes very little to make a reputation at camp. Estimates are formed very swiftly, and great attachments and antipathies are formed at first sight. Young girls seem to scent, by some mysterious intuition, who is really in sympathy with them, and who is only pretending to be, and bestow or withhold their affections accordingly. In the code of the camp girl classifications are very simple; a camper is either a \"peach\" or a \"prune.\" All the other councilors were \"peaches\"; that was the instantaneous verdict of the Keewaydin Campers during the introductions; Miss Peckham, regardless of the fact that she was Dr. Grayson's cousin, was a \"prune.\"  The last councilor to be introduced was a handsome, white-haired woman named Miss Amesbury, who was introduced as the patron saint of the camp, the designer of the beautiful Mateka, the House of Joyous Learning. Miss Amesbury was neither an instructor nor a tent councilor; she had just come to be a friend and helper to the whole camp, and lived on the second story balcony of Mateka. Word had traveled around among the girls that she was a famous author, and a ripple of expectation agitated the ranks of the campers as she rose in answer to Dr. Grayson's summons. Migwan gazed upon her in mingled awe and veneration. A famous author--one who had realized the ambition that was also her cherished own! She almost stopped breathing in her emotion.  \"Isn't she lovely?\" breathed Hinpoha to Agony, her eye taking in the details of Miss Amesbury's camping suit, which, instead of being made of serge or khaki, like those of the other councilors, was of heavy Japanese silk, with a soft, flowered tie.  Smiling a smile which included every girl in the room, she cordially invited them all to come and visit her balcony and share the beautiful view which she had of the river and the gorge. Then she added a few humorous comments upon camp life, and sat down amid tumultuous applause.  Then Dr. Grayson asked her if she would play for the singing, and she rose graciously and took her place at the piano. The Sing leader stood up on a bench and directed with a wooden spoon from the craft table, and the first Sing-Out began. For half an hour the mingled voices were lifted in glee and round, in part song and ballad, until the roof rang. The new girls, spelling out the words in the song books by the rather pale lamplight, came out strongly in some parts and wobbly in others, producing some tone effects which caused the old girls to double up with merriment, but the new girls showed their good sportsmanship by singing on lustily no matter how many mistakes they made, a fact which caused Dr. Grayson to beam approvingly upon them. In the midst of a particularly hilarious song the bugle suddenly blew for going to bed, and the old girls, still singing, began to drift out of the house and make for the tents in groups of twos and threes, with their arms thrown around each other's shoulders. The new girls followed, some feeling shy and a bit homesick this first night away from home; others already perfectly at home, their arms around a new friend made in the short time since their arrival. One such was Jean Lawrence, who, upon being informed that she was to be \"tenty\" to Katherine and Oh-Pshaw in Bedlam, expressed herself as being unutterably delighted with her tent mates and walked off with them chattering as easily as though she had known them all her life.  There was more or less confusion this first night before everyone got settled, for many of the girls had never camped before and were unskilled in the art of undressing rapidly in the close quarters of a tent, and \"Taps\" sounded before a number were even undressed. The Lone Wolf was lenient this first night, however, and did not insist upon prompt lights out, an act of grace which added greatly to her popularity.  Sahwah's bed sagged somewhat in the middle and she was not able to adjust herself to its curves very well; consequently she did not fall asleep soon. Camp quieted down; the last rustle and whisper died away; silence enfolded the tents around. Sahwah, lying wide awake in the darkness, her senses alert, heard the sound of footsteps running at full speed along the top of the bluff and across the bare rocks at the edge. Here the footsteps seemed to come to a pause, and an instant later there came a sound like a loud splash in the water below. Filled both with curiosity and apprehension, Sahwah leaped from bed and raced for the edge of the bluff, where she stood peering down at the river. No unusual ripple appeared on the placid surface of the river; as far as she could see it lay calm and peaceful in the moonlight.  A footstep behind her startled her, and she turned to see Miss Judy coming toward her from the tent.  \"What's the matter?\" called Miss Judy, when she was within a few yards of Sahwah.  \"It sounded as though someone jumped off the cliff,\" replied Sahwah. \"I heard footsteps along the edge of the bluff, and then a splash, and I ran out to see what was going on, but I can't see anything.\"  To Sahwah's surprise, Miss Judith laughed aloud. \"Oh,\" she said, \"did you hear it?\"  \"What was it?\" asked Sahwah, curiously.  \"That,\" replied Miss Judy, \"is what we call the Great Mystery Sound. We hear it off and on, but no one has ever been able to explain what causes it. Our 'diving ghost,' we call it. Father wore himself to a frazzle the first year we were here, trying to find out what it was. He used to sit up nights and watch, but although he often heard it he never could see anything that could produce the sound. Some people about here have told us that that sound has been heard for years and they say that there is an old legend connected with it to the effect that many years ago an Indian girl, pursued by an unwelcome suitor, jumped off this bluff and drowned herself to escape him, and that ever since that occurrence this strange sound has been noticeable. Of course, the people who tell the legend say that the ghost of the persecuted maiden haunts the scene of the tragedy at intervals and repeats the performance. Whatever it is, we have never been able to account for the sound naturally, and always refer to it as the Great Mystery Sound.\"  \"What a strange thing!\" exclaimed Sahwah in wonder. \"Those footsteps certainly sounded real; and as for that splash! It actually made my flesh creep. I had a panicky feeling that one of the new girls had wandered too near the edge of the bluff and had fallen into the water.\"  \"It used to have that effect upon us at first, too,\" replied Miss Judy. \"We would all come racing down here with our hearts in our mouths, expecting we knew not what. It took a long time before we could believe it was a delusion.  \"And now, come back to bed, or you'll be taking cold, standing out here in your nightgown.\"  Still looking back at the river and half expecting to see some agitation in its surface, Sahwah followed Miss Judy back to Gitchee-Gummee and returned to bed.     CHAPTER IV   THE ALLEY INITIATION  Folk-dancing hour had just drawn to a close, and the long bugle for swimming sounded through camp. The sets of eight which had been drawn up on the tennis court in the formation of \"If All the World Were Paper,\" broke and scattered as before a whirlwind as the girls raced for their tents to get into bathing suits. Sahwah, as might be expected, was first down on the dock, but close at her heels was another girl whom she recognized as living in one of the Avenue tents. This girl, while broader and heavier than Sahwah, moved with the same easy grace that characterized Sahwah's movements, and like Sahwah, she seemed consumed with impatience to get into the water.  \"Oh, I wish Miss Armstrong would hurry, hurry, hurry!\" she exclaimed, jigging up and down on the dock. \"I just can't wait until I get in.\"  \"Neither can I,\" replied Sahwah, scanning the path down the hillside for a sight of the swimming director.  \"Do you live in the Avenue or the Alley?\" asked the girl beside her.  \"In the Alley,\" replied Sahwah.  \"Which tent?\"  \"Gitchee-Gummee. Which one are you in?\"  \"Jabberwocky.\"  \"That's way up near the bungalow, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, where are you?\"  \"The very last tent in the Alley, that one there, buried in the trees.\"  \"Oh, how lovely! You're right near the path to the river, aren't you? I wish I were a little nearer this end. It would save time getting to the water.\"  \"But you're so near the bungalow that you only have to go a step when the breakfast bugle blows. You have the advantage there,\" replied Sahwah. \"We down in Gitchee-Gummee have to run for all we're worth to get there before you're all assembled. We have hard work getting dressed in time. We put on our ties while we're running down the path, as it is.\"  The other girl laughed, showing a row of very white, even teeth. \"Did you see that girl who came running into the dining-room this morning with her middy halfway over her head?\"  Sahwah laughed, too, at the recollection. \"That was Bengal Virden, the one they call the Elephant's Child,\" she replied. \"She lives in Ponemah, with some friends of mine. She had loitered with her dressing and didn't have her middy on when the breakfast bugle blew, so she decided to put it on en route. But while she was pulling it on over her head she got stuck fast in it with her arms straight up in the air and had to come in that way and get somebody to pull her through. I never saw anything so funny,\" she finished.  \"Neither did I,\" replied the other.  They looked at each other and laughed heartily at the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10688"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at Camp Keewaydin; Or, Paddles Down (#6)"],["body","of the ludicrous episode.  All this while Sahwah was trying to recollect her companion's name, but was unable to do so. It was impossible to remember which girls had answered to which names at the general roll call on that first night in Mateka.  Just then the other said, \"I don't believe I recall your name--I'm very stupid about remembering things.\"  \"That's just what I was going to say to you!\" exclaimed Sahwah, with a merry laugh. \"It's impossible to remember so many new names at once. I think we all ought to be labeled for the first week or so. I'm Sarah Ann Brewster, only they call me Sahwah.\"  \"What a queer nickname! It's very interesting. Is it a contraction of Sarah Ann?\"  \"No, it's my Camp Fire name.\"  \"Oh, are you a Camp Fire girl?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How splendid! I've always wished I could be one. What does the name mean?\"  \"Sunfish!\" replied Sahwah. \"The sun part means that I like sunshine and the fish part means that I like the water.\"  \"Oh-h!\" replied the other with an interested face. Then she began to introduce herself. \"I haven't any nice symbolic name like yours,\" she said, \"but mine is sort of queer, too.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Sahwah.  \"Undine.\"  \"Undine!\" repeated Sahwah. \"How lovely! I've always been perfectly crazy about Undine since I got the book on my tenth birthday. Undine was fond of water, like I was. What's the rest of your name?\"  \"Girelle,\" replied Undine.  \"Do you live in the east or in the west?\" asked Sahwah. \"You don't speak like the Easterners, and yet you don't speak like us Westerners, either. What part of the country are you from?\"  \"No part at all,\" answered Undine. \"My home is in Honolulu.\"  \"Not really?\" said Sahwah in astonishment.  \"Really,\" replied Undine, smiling at Sahwah's look of surprise. \"I was born in Hawaii, and I have lived there most of my life.\"  \"Oh,\" said Sahwah, \"I thought only Hawaiians lived in Hawaii--I didn't know anyone else was ever _born_ there.\"  \"Lots of white people are born there,\" replied Undine, politely checking the smile that wreathed her lips at Sahwah's ingenuous remark. \"But,\" she added, \"most of the people in the States seem to think no one lives in Hawaii but natives, and that they wear wreaths of flowers around their necks all the time and do nothing but play on ukuleles.\"  Sahwah laughed and made up her mind that she was going to like Undine very much. \"I suppose you swim?\" she asked, presently.  Undine nodded emphatically. \"It's the thing I like to do best of anything in the world. Do you like it? Oh, yes, of course you do. You call yourself the Sunfish on that account.\"  Sahwah affirmed her love for the deep, and thrilled a little at discovering an enthusiasm to match hers in this girl from Honolulu. The rest of the Winnebagos, although good swimmers, did not possess in an equal degree Sahwah's inborn passion for the water. Sahwah and Undine both felt the call of the river as it flowed past the dock; to each of them it beckoned with an irresistible invitation, until they could hardly restrain themselves from leaping off the boards into the cool, glassy depths below.  \"Here comes Miss Armstrong!\" shouted somebody at the other end of the dock, as the big Australian came into view down the path, and there was a scramble for the diving tower.  The swimming place at Camp Keewaydin was divided into three parts. A shallow cove at the left of the dock, where the curve of the river formed a tiny bay, was the sporting ground of the Minnows, the girls who could not swim at all; the Perch, or those who could swim a little, but were not yet sure of themselves, were assigned to the other side of the dock, where the water was slightly deeper, but where they were protected by the dock from the full force of the current; while the Sharks, the expert swimmers, were given the freedom of the river beyond the end of the pier. The diving tower was on the end of the pier and belonged exclusively to the Sharks; it was fifteen feet high, and had seven different diving boards placed at various heights. Besides the diving tower, there was a floating dock anchored out in midstream, having a springboard at either end. There was also a low diving board at the side of the pier for the Perch to practice on.  Miss Armstrong came down on the dock in a bright red bathing suit which shone brilliantly among the darker suits of the girls. She rapidly separated the Minnows from the other fish, and set them to learning their first strokes under the direction of one of the other councilors. Then she lined the remaining girls up for the test which would determine who were Sharks and who were Perch. The test consisted of a dive from any one of the diving boards of the tower and a demonstration of four standard strokes, ending up with a swim across the river and back.  About a dozen dropped out at the mere reading of the test and accepted their rating as Perch without a trial; as many more failed either to execute their dives properly or to give satisfaction in their swimming strokes. Sahwah, burning with impatience to show her skill, climbed nimbly up to the very top of the tower and went off the highest springboard in a neat back dive that drew applause from the watchers, including Miss Armstrong. She also passed the rest of the test with a perfect rating.  \"You're the biggest Shark so far,\" remarked Miss Armstrong, as Sahwah clambered up on the dock after her swim across the river, during which she had almost outdistanced the boat which accompanied her over and back.  Sahwah smiled modestly as one of the old campers started a cheer for her, and turned to watch Undine Girelle, who was mounting the diving tower. When Undine also went off the highest springboard backward, and in addition turned a complete somersault before she touched the water, Sahwah realized that she had met her match, if not her master. Heretofore, Sahwah's swimming prowess had been unrivalled in whatever group she found herself, and it was a matter of course with the Winnebagos that Sahwah should carry off all honors in aquatics. Now they had to admit that in Undine Girelle Sahwah had a formidable rival and would have to look sharply to her laurels.  \"Isn't she wonderful?\" came in exclamations from all around, as Undine sported in the water like a dolphin. \"But then,\" someone added, \"she's used to bathing in the surf in Hawaii. No wonder.\"  There were about fifteen put in the Shark class in the first try-out, of whom Sahwah and Undine were acknowledged to be the best. Hinpoha and Gladys and Migwan also qualified as Sharks; Katherine went voluntarily into the Perch class, and Agony failed to pass her diving test, although she accomplished her distance swim and the demonstration of the strokes.  Agony felt somewhat humiliated at having to go into the second class; she would much rather have been in the more conspicuous Shark group. Sahwah had already made a reputation for herself; Hinpoha drew admiring attention when she let her glorious red curls down her back to dry them in the sun; but she herself had so far made no special impression upon the camp. Why hadn't she distinguished herself like Sahwah, or Undine Girelle, Agony thought enviously. Others were already fast on their way to becoming prominent, but so far she was still going unnoticed. Her spirit chafed within her at her obscurity.  Oh-Pshaw, alas, was only a Minnow. The fear of water which had lurked in her ever since the accident in her early childhood had kept her from any attempt to learn to swim. It was only since she had become a Winnebago and had once conquered her fear on that memorable night beside the Devil's Punch Bowl that she began to entertain the idea that some day she, too, might be at home in the water like the others. It was still a decided ordeal for her to go in; to feel the water flowing over her feet and to hear it splash against the piles of the dock and gurgle over the stones along the shore; but she resolutely steeled her nerves against the sound and the feel of the water, forcing back the terror that gripped her like an icy hand, and courageously tried to follow the director's instructions to put her face down under the surface. It was no use; she could not quite bring herself to do it; the moment the water struck her chin wild panic seized her and she would straighten up with a choking cry. She looked with envy at the other novices around her who fearlessly threw themselves into the water face downward, learning \"Dead Man's Float\" inside of ten minutes. She would never be able to do _that_, she reflected sorrowfully, as she climbed up on the dock before the period was half over, utterly worn out and discouraged by her repeated failures to bring her head under water.  Beside her on the dock sat a thin wisp of a girl whose bathing suit was not even wet.  \"Didn't you go in?\" asked Oh-Pshaw.  \"No,\" replied the girl in a high, piping voice, and Oh-Pshaw recognized her as the dweller in Avernus who had come over that first day and asked them how to make her bed. Carmen Chadwick, they had found out her name was.  \"I'm afraid of the water,\" continued Carmen. \"Mamma never let me go in at home. She doesn't think it's quite ladylike for girls to swim.\"  Oh-Pshaw smiled in spite of herself. \"Oh, I don't think it makes girls unladylike to learn how to swim,\" she defended. \"It's considered to be a fine exercise; about the best there is to develop all the muscles.\"  \"Oh!\" said Carmen primly. \"That's what mamma doesn't like, to have my muscles all lumpy and developed. She wants to keep me soft and curved.\"  Oh-Pshaw stifled a shriek with difficulty, and turning aside to hide her twinkling eyes she caught sight of the Lone Wolf standing on the dock not far away, gazing mournfully into the Minnow pond.  \"What do you think of _her_?\" asked Oh-Pshaw hastily, steering the conversation away from muscles and kindred unladylike topics.  \"She's my Councy,\" replied Carmen.  \"Your what?\"  \"My Councy--my Councilor. I'm frightened to"]]]
