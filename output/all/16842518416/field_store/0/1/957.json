Old Kaspar took it from the boy,     Who stood expectant by; And then the old man shook his head,     And, with a natural sigh— “’Tis some poor fellow’s skull,” said he, “Who fell in the great victory.  “I find them in the garden,     For there’s many hereabout; And often when I go to plow,     The plowshare turns them out! For many a thousand men,” said he, “Were slain in the great victory.”  “Now tell us what ’twas all about,”     Young Peterkin he cries; And little Wilhelmine looks up     With wonder-waiting eyes— “Now tell us all about the war, And what they fought each other for.”  “It was the English,” Kaspar cried,     “Who put the French to rout; But what they fought each other for     I could not well make out; But everybody said,” quoth he, “That ’twas a famous victory.  “My father lived at Blenheim then,     Yon little stream hard by; They burnt his dwelling to the ground,     And he was forced to fly; So with his wife and child he fled, Nor had he where to rest his head.  “They say it was a shocking sight     After the field was won— For many thousand bodies here     Lay rotting in the sun; But things like that, you know, must be After a famous victory.  “Great praise the Duke of Marlborough won,     And our good Prince Eugene.” “Why, ’twas a very wicked thing!”     Said little Wilhelmine. “Nay, nay, my little girl,” quoth he, “It was a famous victory.  “And everybody praised the duke     Who this great fight did win.” “But what good came of it at last?”     Quoth little Peterkin. “Why, that I cannot tell,” said he; “But ’twas a famous victory.”  —_Robert Southey_.        Old Kaspar, who has been used to such things all his life, cannot       feel the wickedness and horror Of the battle. The children, on       the other hand, have a different idea of war. They are not       satisfied until they know what it was all about and what good       came of it, and they feel that “it was a very wicked thing.” If       the men in the armies had stopped to ask the reason why they were       killing each other and had refused to fight until they knew the       truth, the history of the world would have been very different.        One reason why we still have wars is that men refuse to think for       themselves, because it is so much easier to let their dead       ancestors think for them and to keep up customs which should have       been changed ages ago. People in Europe have lived in the midst       of wars or preparation for wars all their lives. There never has       been a time when Europe was not either a battlefield or a great       drill-ground for armies.        There was a time, long ago, when any man might kill another in       Europe and not be punished for his deed. It was not thought wrong       to take human life. Today it is not considered wrong to kill,       provided a man is ordered to do so by his general or his king.       When two kings go to war, each claiming his quarrel to be a just       one, wholesale murder is done, and each side is made by its       government to think itself very virtuous and wholly justified in       its killing. It should be the great aim of everyone today to help       to bring about lasting peace among all the nations.  [Illustration: A Drill Ground in Modern Europe.]        In order to know how to do this, we must study the causes of the       wars of the past. We shall find, as we do so, that almost all       wars can be traced to one of four causes: (1) the instinct among       barbarous tribes to fight with and plunder their neighbors; (2)       the ambition of kings to enlarge their kingdoms; (3) the desire       of the traders of one nation to increase their commerce at the       expense of some other nation; (4) a people’s wish to be free from       the control of some other country and to become a nation by       itself. Of the four reasons, only the last furnishes a just cause       for war, and this cause has been brought about only when kings       have sent their armies out, and forced into their kingdoms other       peoples who wished to govern themselves.           Questions for Review             Why must foreigners in the United States return to their           native lands when summoned by their governments?            How is it that war helps to breed diseases?            Is race hatred a cause of war or a result of it?            Whom do we mean by the government in the United States?            Who controls the government in Russia?            Who in England?            Who in Germany?            Who in France?            In Southey’s poem, how does the children’s idea of the battle           differ from that of their grandfather? Why?            Are people less likely to protest against war if their           forefathers have fought many wars?            What have been the four main causes of war?     Chapter II. Rome and the Barbarian Tribes        New governments in Europe.—Earliest times.—How civilization       began.—The rise of Rome.—Roman civilization.—Roman cruelty.—The       German tribes.—The Slavic tribes.—The Celtic tribes.—The Huns and       Moors.—The great Germanic invasions of the Roman world.         To search for the causes of the great war which began in Europe       in 1914, we must go far back into history. It should be       remembered that many of the governments of today have not lived       as long as that of our own country. This is, perhaps, a new       thought to some of us, who rather think that, as America is a new       country, it is the baby among the great nations. But, one hundred       and thirty years ago, when the United States was being formed,       there was no nation called Italy; the peninsula which we now know       by that name was cut up among nine or ten little governments.       There was no nation known as Germany; the land which is in the       present German empire was then divided among some thirty or       thirty-five different rulers. There was no Republic of France;       instead, France had a king whose will was law, and the French       people were cruelly oppressed. There was no kingdom of Belgium,       no kingdom of Serbia, of Bulgaria, of Roumania. The kingdom of       Norway was part of Denmark. The Republic of France, as we now       know it, dates back only to 1871; the Empire of Germany and the       United Kingdom of Italy to about the same time. The kingdoms of       Roumania, Serbia, and Bulgaria have been independent of Turkey       only since 1878. The kingdom of Albania did not exist before       1913. Most of the present nations of modern Europe, then, are       very new. The troubles which led to the great war, however,       originated in the dim twilight of history.        In the earliest days, there were no separate countries or       kingdoms. Men gathered together in little bands, each of which       had its leader. This leader was generally chosen because of his       bodily strength and courage. He was the best fighter of the       tribe. The people did not have any lasting homes. They moved       around from place to place, wherever they could find the best       hunting and fishing. When two tribes wanted the same hunting       grounds, they fought, and the weaker party had to give way.       Selfishness was supreme. If a man wanted anything which belonged       to his weaker neighbor, he simply beat this neighbor over the       head with his club, and took it. The stronger tribe attacked the       weaker, without any thought of whether or not its quarrel was       just.        Gradually, in the southern and warmer parts of Europe, the tribes       began to be more civilized. Towns sprang up. Ships were built.       Trade came to be one of the occupations. The fighting men needed       weapons and armor; so there grew up artisans who were skilled in       working metals. In Egypt and Syria there were people who had       reached quite a high degree of civilization, and gradually the       Europeans learned from them better ways of living. First the       Greeks, then the Etruscans (Ē-trŭs′cans), a people who lived in       Italy just north of where Rome now is, and finally the southern       Italians learned that it was possible to live in cities, without       hunting and plundering. Grazing (the tending of flocks of       animals) came to be the occupation of many. The owners of sheep       or cattle drove their flocks from place to place, as grass and       water failed them where they were. There was no separate       ownership of land.        At last came the rise of the city of Rome, which, starting out as       the stronghold of a little gang of robbers, spread its rule       gradually over all the surrounding country. By this time, the       barbarians of northern Europe had gotten past the use of clubs as       weapons. They, too, had learned to make tools and arms of bronze,       and those living near civilized countries had obtained swords of       iron. The club, however, still remained as the sign of authority.       The large bludgeon of the chief was carried before the tribe as a       sign of his power over them. You have all seen pictures of a king       sitting on his throne and holding a wand or stick in his right       hand. It is interesting to think that this scepter, which the       present king of England carries on state occasions to remind his       people of his power, is a relic of the old, old days when his       grandfather, many times removed, broke the head of his rival for       leadership in the tribe and set up his mighty club for his       awestruck people to worship.        The city of Rome (at first a republic, afterwards an empire)       spread its rule over all of Italy, over all the shores of the       Mediterranean Sea, and finally over all the countries of Europe       south and west of the rivers Danube and Rhine. One of the       emperors planted a colony north of the Danube near its"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11200"],["title","The World War and What was Behind It; Or, The Story of the Map of Europe (#3)"],["body","h, and       the descendants of these colonists are living in that same       country today. They have not forgotten their origin, for they       still call themselves Romans (Roumani [Ro͞o-mä′ni]), and talk a       language greatly resembling the Latin, which was the tongue       spoken by the Romans of old. With the exception of this country,       which is now Roumania, the part of Europe north and east of the       Danube and Rhine was practically free from the Romans. In this       territory, roving bands wandered around, driving their cattle       with them and clearing the woods of game.  [Illustration: The Forum (public square) of Rome as it was 1600 years ago.]        In some ways, the Romans were a highly civilized people. They had       schools where their children were taught to read and write, to       speak Greek, and to work problems in geometry. They had       magnificent public buildings, fine temples and palaces. They       built excellent paved roads all over the southern part of Europe,       and had wonderful systems of aqueducts which supplied their       cities with pure water from springs and lakes miles away. Their       dress was made of fine cloth. They knew how to make paper, glass,       and steel.        On the other hand, they were a cruel and bloodthirsty people.       Their favorite amusement was to go to shows where gladiators       fought, either with each other or with wild beasts. These       gladiators were generally men from tribes which had fought       against Rome. They had been captured and brought to that city,       where they were trained to use certain weapons. Then on holidays,       with all the people of Rome packed into big amphitheaters, these       unfortunate captives were forced to fight with each other until       one man of each pair was killed. It occasionally happened that       one gladiator might be wounded, and lie helpless on the sand, The       spectators would then shout to the victorious fighter to take his       knife and finish what he had begun. In this way what would seem       to us like cold-blooded murder was committed hundreds of times       each year, while the fairest ladies and young girls of Rome sat       and watched with eager interest. Thus, although the Romans had       all the outward appearance of being civilized, they were savages       at heart, and had no sympathy for any people who were not of       their own race.  [Illustration: The Last Combat of the Gladiators]        In the early days, the Romans prided themselves on their honor.       They scorned a lie and looked down on anyone who would cheat or       deceive. They lived hardy lives and would not allow themselves       luxuries. They rather despised the Greeks, because the latter       surrounded themselves with comforts in life. The early Romans       were fighters by nature. They had a certain god named Janus (our       month January is named after him) and his temple was open only       when they were engaged in war. It is a matter of history that       during the twelve hundred years from the first building of Rome       to the end of the Roman Empire, the temple of Janus was closed on       but three occasions and then only for a short time.        About five or six hundred years after the founding of Rome came       several disastrous wars which killed off a great majority of her       sturdy fighters. Rome was the victor in all of these wars, but       she won them at tremendous cost to herself. With the killing off       of her best and bravest men, a great deal of the old time honesty       was lost. Very soon, we begin to hear of Roman governors who,       when put in charge of conquered states, used their offices only       to plunder the helpless inhabitants and to return to Rome after       their terms were finished, laden with ill-gotten gains. Roman       morals, which formerly were very strict, began to grow more lax,       and in general the Roman civilization showed signs of decay.        To the north and east of the Roman Empire dwelt a people who were       to become the leaders of the new nations of Europe. These were       the free German tribes, which occupied the part of Europe       bounded, roughly, by the rivers Danube and Rhine, the Baltic Sea,       and the Carpathian Mountains. In many ways they were much less       civilized than the Romans. They were clad in skins and furs       instead of cloth. They lived in rough huts and tents or in caves       dug in the sides of a hill. They, too, like the Romans, held       human life cheap, and bloodshed and murder were common among       them. As a rule, the men scorned to work, leaving whatever labor       there was, largely to the women, while they busied themselves in       fighting and hunting, or, during their idle times, in gambling.       Nevertheless, these people, about the time that the Roman honesty       began to disappear, had virtues more like those of the early       Romans. They were frank and honorable. The men were faithful       husbands and kind fathers, and their family life was very happy.       They were barbarous and rough, but those of them who were taken       to Rome and learned the Roman civilization made finer, nobler men       than Rome was producing about the time of which we speak.  [Illustration: Germans Going Into Battle]        To the east of these German tribes were the Slavs, a people no       better civilized, but not so warlike in their nature. As the       Germans, in later years, moved on to the west, the Slavs, in       turn, moved westward and occupied much of the land which had been       left vacant by the Germans.  [Illustration: A Hun Warrior]        The inhabitants of western Europe, that is, France, Spain, and       the British Isles, were largely Celts. In fact, all Europe could       be said to be divided up among four great peoples: There were the       Latins in Italy, the Celts in western Europe, the Germans in       central Europe, and the Slavs to the east. All of these four       families were distantly related, as can be proved by the       languages which they spoke. The Greeks, while not belonging to       any one of the four, were also distant cousins of both Germans       and Latins. Probably all five peoples are descended from one big       family of tribes.        In addition to these, there were, from time to time invasions of       Europe by other nations which did not have any connection by       blood with Celts, Latins, Greeks, Germans, or Slavs. For       instance, the ferocious Huns, a people of the yellow race, rushed       into Europe about 400 A.D., but were beaten in a big battle by       the Romans and Germans and finally went back to Asia. Three       hundred years later, a great horde of Moors and Arabs from Africa       crossed over into Europe by way of the Straits of Gibraltar, and       at one time threatened to sweep before them all the Christian       nations. For several hundred years after this, they held the       southern part of Spain, but were finally driven out.        Let us now come back to the story of what happened in Europe       after the Romans had conquered all the country south and west of       the Danube and Rhine. The wild tribes of the Germans were       restlessly roaming through the central part of Europe. They were       not at peace with each other. In fact, constant war was going on.       Julius Caesar, the great Roman general, who conquered what is now       France and added it to the Roman world, tells us that one great       tribe of Germans, the Suevi (Swē′vī), made it their boast that       they would let no other tribe live anywhere near them. About a       hundred years B.C., two great German tribes. the Cimbri and the       Teutones, broke across the Rhine and poured into the Roman lands       in countless numbers. For seven years they roamed about until at       last they were conquered in two bloody battles by a Roman       general, who was Caesar’s uncle by marriage. After this time, the       Romans tried to conquer the country of the Germans and they might       have been successful but for a young German chief named Arminius.       He had lived in Rome as a young man and had learned the Romans’       method of war; so when an army came against his tribe, he taught       the Germans how to defend themselves. As a result, the Roman army       was trapped in a big forest and slaughtered, almost to a man.  [Illustration: Gaius Julius Caesar.  From a bust in the British Museum]        This defeat ended any thought that the Romans may have had of       conquering all Germany. For the next one hundred and fifty years,       Germans and Romans lived apart, each afraid of the other. Then       came a time when the Germans again became the attacking party.       Other fiercer and wilder peoples, like the Huns, were assailing       them in the east and pushing them forward. They finally broke       over the Rhine-Danube boundary and poured across the Roman Empire       in wave after wave. Some of these tribes were the Vandals,       Burgundians, Goths, Franks, and Lombards. The Roman Empire went       to pieces under their savage attacks.           Questions for Review             Why is it that after nations become civilized, people need           less land to live on?            Are barbarous tribes more likely to engage in war than           civilized peoples?            Explain why clubs were the earliest weapons and why the more           civilized tribes were better armed than the barbarians.            Can a people be said to be civilized when they enjoy           bloodshed and are not moved by the sufferings of others?            What was it that lowered the morals of the Roman republic?            In what way were the Germans better men than the later           Romans?            What was the religion of the Moors and the Arabs?            Why did the German tribes"]]]
