She is all white, yet with streaks of pink that pass through her streets and houses like flames in the white mind of a sculptor, like desire in Paradise.  She hath been carved of old out of a holy hill, no slaves wrought the City of Marvel, but artists toiling at the work they loved.  They took no pattern from the houses of men, but each man wrought what his inner eye had seen and carved in marble the visions of his dream.  All over the roof of one of the palace chambers winged lions flit like bats, the size of every one is the size of the lions of God, and the wings are larger than any wing created; they are one above the other more than a man can number, they are all carven out of one block of marble, the chamber itself is hollowed from it, and it is borne aloft upon the carven branches of a grove of clustered tree-ferns wrought by the hand of some jungle mason that loved the tall fern well.  Over the River of Myth, which is one with the Waters of Fable, go bridges, fashioned like the wisteria tree and like the drooping laburnum, and a hundred others of wonderful devices, the desire of the souls of masons a long while dead.  Oh! very beautiful is white Babbulkund, very beautiful she is, but proud; and the Lord the God of my people hath seen her in her pride, and looking towards her hath seen the prayers of Nehemoth going up to the abomination Annolith and all the people following after Voth.  She is very beautiful, Babbulkund; alas that I may not bless her.  I could live always on one of her inner terraces looking on the mysterious jungle in her midst and the heavenward faces of the orchids that, clambering from the darkness, behold the sun.  I could love Babbulkund with a great love, yet am I the servant of the Lord the God of my people, and the King hath sinned unto the abomination Annolith, and the people lust exceedingly for Voth.  Alas for thee, Babbulkund, alas that I may not even now turn back, for tomorrow I must prophesy against thee and cry out against thee, Babbulkund.  But ye travellers that have entreated me hospitably, rise and pass on with your camels, for I can tarry no longer, and I go to do the work on Babbulkund of the Lord the God of my people.  Go now and see the beauty of Babbulkund before I cry out against her, and then flee swiftly northwards.'  A smouldering fragment fell in upon our camp fire and sent a strange light into the eyes of the man in rags.  He rose at once, and his tattered cloak swirled up with him like a great wing; he said no more, but turned round from us instantly southwards, and strode away into the darkness towards Babbulkund.  Then a hush fell upon our encampment, and the smell of the tobacco of those lands arose.  When the last flame died down in our camp fire I fell asleep, but my rest was troubled by shifting dreams of doom.  Morning came, and our guides told us that we should come to the city ere nightfall.  Again we passed southwards through the changeless desert; sometimes we met travellers coming from Babbulkund, with the beauty of its marvels still fresh in their eyes.  When we encamped near the middle of the day we saw a great number of people on foot coming towards us running, from the southwards.  These we hailed when they were come near, saying, 'What of Babbulkund?'  They answered: 'We are not of the race of the people of Babbulkund, but were captured in youth and taken away from the hills that are to the northward.  Now we have all seen in visions of the stillness the Lord the God of our people calling to us from His hills, and therefore we all flee northwards.  But in Babbulkund King Nehemoth hath been troubled in the nights by unkingly dreams of doom, and none may interpret what the dreams portend.  Now this is the dream that King Nehemoth dreamed on the first night of his dreaming.  He saw move through the stillness a bird all black, and beneath the beatings of his wings Babbulkund gloomed and darkened; and after him flew a bird all white, beneath the beatings of whose wings Babbulkund gleamed and shone; and there flew by four more birds alternately black and white.  And, as the black ones passed Babbulkund darkened, and when the white ones appeared her streets and houses shone.  But after the sixth bird there came no more, and Babbulkund vanished from her place, and there was only the empty desert where she had stood, and the rivers Oonrana and Plegáthanees mourning alone.  Next morning all the prophets of the King gathered before their abominations and questioned them of the dream, and the abominations spake not.  But when the second night stepped down from the halls of God, dowered with many stars, King Nehemoth dreamed again; and in this dream King Nehemoth saw four birds only, black and white alternately as before.  And Babbulkund darkened again as the black ones passed, and shone when the white came by; only after the four birds came no more, and Babbulkund vanished from her place, leaving only the forgetful desert and the mourning rivers.  'Still the abominations spake not, and none could interpret the dream.  And when the third night came forth from the divine halls of her home dowered like her sisters, again King Nehemoth dreamed. And he saw a bird all black go by again, beneath whom Babbulkund darkened, and then a white bird and Babbulkund shone; and after them came no more, and Babbulkund passed away.  And the golden day appeared, dispelling dreams, and still the abominations were silent, and the King's prophets answered not to portend the omen of the dream.  One prophet only spake before the King, saying: \"The sable birds, O King, are the nights, and the white birds are the days.  . .\" This thing the King had feared, and he arose and smote the prophet with his sword, whose soul went crying away and had to do no more with nights and days.  'It was last night that the King dreamed his third dream, and this morning we fled away from Babbulkund.  A great heat lies over it, and the orchids of the jungle droop their heads.  All night long the women in the hareem of the North have wailed horribly for their hills.  A fear hath fallen upon the city, and a boding.  Twice hath Nehemoth gone to worship Annolith, and all the people have prostrated themselves before Voth.  Thrice the horologers have looked into the great crystal globe wherein are foretold all happenings to be, and thrice the globe was blank.  Yea, though they went a fourth time yet was no vision revealed; and the people's voice is hushed in Babbulkund.'  Soon the travellers arose and pushed on northwards again, leaving us wondering.  Through the heat of the day we rested as well as we might, but the air was motionless and sultry and the camels ill at ease.  The Arabs said that it boded a desert storm, and that a great wind would arise full of sand.  So we arose in the afternoon, and travelled swiftly, hoping to come to shelter before the storm.  And the air burned in the stillness between the baked desert and the glaring sky.  Suddenly a wind arose out of the South, blowing from Babbulkund, and the sand lifted and went by in great shapes, all whispering.  And the wind blew violently, and wailed as it blew, and hundreds of sandy shapes went towering by, and there were little cries among them and the sounds of a passing away.  Soon the wind sank quite suddenly, and its cries died, and the panic ceased among the driven sands.  And when the storm departed the air was cool, and the terrible sultriness and the boding were passed away, and the camels had ease among them.  And the Arabs said that the storm which was to be had been, as was willed of old by God.  The sun set and the gloaming came, and we neared the junction of Oonrana and Plegáthanees, but in the darkness discerned not Babbulkund.  We pushed on hurriedly to reach the city ere nightfall, and came to the junction of the River of Myth where he meets with the Waters of Fable, and still saw not Babbulkund.  All round us lay the sand and rocks of the unchanging desert, save to the southwards where the jungle stood with its orchids facing skywards.  Then we perceived that we had arrived too late, and that her doom had come to Babbulkund; and by the river in the empty desert on the sand the man in rags was seated, with his face hidden in his hands, weeping bitterly.      *   *   *   *   *   *   *  Thus passed away in the hour of her iniquities before Annolith, in the two thousand and thirty-second year of her being, in the six thousand and fiftieth year of the building of the World, Babbulkund, City of Marvel, sometime called by those that hated her City of the Dog, but hourly mourned in Araby and Ind and wide through jungle and desert; leaving no memorial in stone to show that she had been, but remembered with an abiding love, in spite of the anger of God, by all that knew her beauty, whereof still they sing.     The Kith of the Elf Folk  Chapter I  The north wind was blowing, and red and golden the last days of Autumn were streaming hence.  Solemn and cold over the marshes arose the evening.  It became very still.  Then the last pigeon went home to the trees on the dry land in the distance, whose shapes already had taken upon themselves a mystery in the haze.  Then all was still again.  As the light faded and the haze deepened, mystery crept nearer from every side.  Then the green plover came in crying, and all alighted.  And again it became still, save when one of the plover arose and flew a little way uttering the cry of the waste.  And hushed and silent became the earth, expecting the first star.  Then the duck came in, and the widgeon, company by company: and all the light of day faded out of the sky saving one red band of light.  Across the light appeared, black and huge, the wings of a flock of geese beating up wind to the marshes.  These, too, went down among the rushes.  Then the stars appeared and shone in the stillness, and there was silence in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10806"],["title","The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories (#6)"],["body"," great spaces of the night.  Suddenly the bells of the cathedral in the marshes broke out, calling to evensong.  Eight centuries ago on the edge of the marsh men had built the huge cathedral, or it may have been seven centuries ago, or perhaps nine--it was all one to the Wild Things.  So evensong was held, and candles lighted, and the lights through the windows shone red and green in the water, and the sound of the organ went roaring over the marshes.  But from the deep and perilous places, edged with bright mosses, the Wild Things came leaping up to dance on the reflection of the stars, and over their heads as they danced the marsh-lights rose and fell.  The Wild Things are somewhat human in appearance, only all brown of skin and barely two feet high.  Their ears are pointed like the squirrel's, only far larger, and they leap to prodigious heights. They live all day under deep pools in the loneliest marshes, but at night they come up and dance.  Each Wild Thing has over its head a marsh-light, which moves as the Wild Thing moves; they have no souls, and cannot die, and are of the kith of the Elf-folk.  All night they dance over the marshes, treading upon the reflection of the stars (for the bare surface of the water will not hold them by itself); but when the stars begin to pale, they sink down one by one into the pools of their home.  Or if they tarry longer, sitting upon the rushes, their bodies fade from view as the marsh-fires pale in the light, and by daylight none may see the Wild Things of the kith of the Elf-folk.  Neither may any see them even at night unless they were born, as I was, in the hour of dusk, just at the moment when the first star appears.  Now, on the night that I tell of, a little Wild Thing had gone drifting over the waste, till it came right up to the walls of the cathedral and danced upon the images of the coloured saints as they lay in the water among the reflection of the stars.  And as it leaped in its fantastic dance, it saw through the painted windows to where the people prayed, and heard the organ roaring over the marshes.  The sound of the organ roared over the marshes, but the song and prayers of the people streamed up from the cathedral's highest tower like thin gold chains, and reached to Paradise, and up and down them went the angels from Paradise to the people, and from the people to Paradise again.  Then something akin to discontent troubled the Wild Thing for the first time since the making of the marshes; and the soft grey ooze and the chill of the deep water seemed to be not enough, nor the first arrival from northwards of the tumultuous geese, nor the wild rejoicing of the wings of the wildfowl when every feather sings, nor the wonder of the calm ice that comes when the snipe depart and beards the rushes with frost and clothes the hushed waste with a mysterious haze where the sun goes red and low, nor even the dance of the Wild Things in the marvellous night; and the little Wild Thing longed to have a soul, and to go and worship God.  And when evensong was over and the lights were out, it went back crying to its kith.  But on the next night, as soon as the images of the stars appeared in the water, it went leaping away from star to star to the farthest edge of the marshlands, where a great wood grew where dwelt the Oldest of the Wild Things.  And it found the Oldest of Wild Things sitting under a tree, sheltering itself from the moon.  And the little Wild Thing said: 'I want to have a soul to worship God, and to know the meaning of music, and to see the inner beauty of the marshlands and to imagine Paradise.'  And the Oldest of the Wild Things said to it: 'What have we to do with God? We are only Wild Things, and of the kith of the Elf-folk.'  But it only answered, 'I want to have a soul.'  Then the Oldest of the Wild Things said: 'I have no soul to give you; but if you got a soul, one day you would have to die, and if you knew the meaning of music you would learn the meaning of sorrow, and it is better to be a Wild Thing and not to die.'  So it went weeping away.  But they that were kin to the Elf-folk were sorry for the little Wild Thing; and though the Wild Things cannot sorrow long, having no souls to sorrow with, yet they felt for awhile a soreness where their souls should be, when they saw the grief of their comrade.  So the kith of the Elf-folk went abroad by night to make a soul for the little Wild Thing.  And they went over the marshes till they came to the high fields among the flowers and grasses.  And there they gathered a large piece of gossamer that the spider had laid by twilight; and the dew was on it.  Into this dew had shone all the lights of the long banks of the ribbed sky, as all the colours changed in the restful spaces of evening.  And over it the marvellous night had gleamed with all its stars.  Then the Wild Things went with their dew-bespangled gossamer down to the edge of their home.  And there they gathered a piece of the grey mist that lies by night over the marshlands.  And into it they put the melody of the waste that is borne up and down the marshes in the evening on the wings of the golden plover.  And they put into it, too, the mournful song that the reeds are compelled to sing before the presence of the arrogant North Wind.  Then each of the Wild Things gave some treasured memory of the old marshes, 'For we can spare it,' they said.  And to all this they added a few images of the stars that they gathered out of the water.  Still the soul that the kith of the Elf-folk were making had no life.  Then they put into it the low voices of two lovers that went walking in the night, wandering late alone.  And after that they waited for the dawn.  And the queenly dawn appeared, and the marsh-lights of the Wild Things paled in the glare, and their bodies faded from view; and still they waited by the marsh's edge.  And to them waiting came over field and marsh, from the ground and out of the sky, the myriad song of the birds.  This, too, the Wild Things put into the piece of haze that they had gathered in the marshlands, and wrapped it all up in their dew-bespangled gossamer.  Then the soul lived.  And there it lay in the hands of the Wild Things no larger than a hedgehog; and wonderful lights were in it, green and blue; and they changed ceaselessly, going round and round, and in the grey midst of it was a purple flare.  And the next night they came to the little Wild Thing and showed her the gleaming soul.  And they said to her: 'If you must have a soul and go and worship God, and become a mortal and die, place this to your left breast a little above the heart, and it will enter and you will become a human.  But if you take it you can never be rid of it to become immortal again unless you pluck it out and give it to another; and we will not take it, and most of the humans have a soul already.  And if you cannot find a human without a soul you will one day die, and your soul cannot go to Paradise, because it was only made in the marshes.'  Far away the little Wild Thing saw the cathedral windows alight for evensong, and the song of the people mounting up to Paradise, and all the angels going up and down.  So it bid farewell with tears and thanks to the Wild Things of the kith of Elf-folk, and went leaping away towards the green dry land, holding the soul in its hands.  And the Wild Things were sorry that it had gone, but could not be sorry long, because they had no souls.  At the marsh's edge the little Wild Thing gazed for some moments over the water to where the marsh-fires were leaping up and down, and then pressed the soul against its left breast a little above the heart.  Instantly it became a young and beautiful woman, who was cold and frightened.  She clad herself somehow with bundles of reeds, and went towards the lights of a house that stood close by.  And she pushed open the door and entered, and found a farmer and a farmer's wife sitting over their supper.  And the farmer's wife took the little Wild Thing with the soul of the marshes up to her room, and clothed her and braided her hair, and brought her down again, and gave her the first food that she had ever eaten.  Then the farmer's wife asked many questions.  'Where have you come from?' she said.  'Over the marshes.'  'From what direction?' said the farmer's wife.  'South,' said the little Wild Thing with the new soul.  'But none can come over the marshes from the south,' said the farmer's wife.  'No, they can't do that,' said the farmer.  'I lived in the marshes.'  'Who are you?' asked the farmer's wife.  'I am a Wild Thing, and have found a soul in the marshes, and we are kin to the Elf-folk.'  Talking it over afterwards, the farmer and his wife agreed that she must be a gipsy who had been lost, and that she was queer with hunger and exposure.  So that night the little Wild Thing slept in the farmer's house, but her new soul stayed awake the whole night long dreaming of the beauty of the marshes.  As soon as dawn came over the waste and shone on the farmer's house, she looked from the window towards the glittering waters, and saw the inner beauty of the marsh.  For the Wild Things only love the marsh and know its haunts, but now she perceived the mystery of its distances and the glamour of its perilous pools, with their fair and deadly mosses, and felt the marvel of the North Wind who comes dominant out of unknown icy lands, and the wonder of that ebb and flow of life when the wildfowl whirl in at evening to the marshlands and at dawn pass out to sea.  And she knew that over her head above the farmer's house stretched wide Paradise, where perhaps God was now imagining a sunrise while angels played low on lutes, and the sun came rising up on the world below to gladden fields and marsh.  And all that heaven thought, the marsh thought too; for the blue of the marsh was as the blue of heaven, and the great cloud shapes in heaven became the shapes in the marsh, and through each"]]]
