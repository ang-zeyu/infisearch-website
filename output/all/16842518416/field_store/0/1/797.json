Then, for the space of several seconds, there was a dead silence among the crowd; and it seemed to me that the wind had in it a strange moaning note.  The Second Mate was the first to speak. His voice came so abruptly that it startled me.  \"Get a light, one of you, quick now!\"  There was a moment's hesitation.  \"Fetch one of the binnacle lamps, you, Tammy.\"  \"i, i, Sir,\" the youngster said, in a quavering voice, and ran aft.  In less than a minute I saw the light coming towards us along the deck. The boy was running. He reached us, and handed the lamp to the Second Mate, who took it and went towards the dark, huddled heap on the deck. He held the light out before him, and peered at the thing.  \"My God!\" he said. \"It's Williams!\"  He stooped lower with the light, and I saw details. It was Williams right enough. The Second Mate told a couple of the men to lift him and straighten him out on the hatch. Then he went aft to call the Skipper. He returned in a couple of minutes with an old ensign which he spread over the poor beggar. Almost directly, the Captain came hurrying forward along the decks. He pulled back one end of the ensign, and looked; then he put it back quietly, and the Second Mate explained all that we knew, in a few words.  \"Would you leave him where he is, Sir?\" he asked, after he had told everything.  \"The night's fine,\" said the Captain. \"You may as well leave the poor devil there.\"  He turned, and went aft, slowly. The man who was holding the light, swept it round so that it showed the place where Williams had struck the deck.  The Second Mate spoke abruptly.  \"Get a broom and a couple of buckets, some of you.\"  He turned sharply, and ordered Tammy on to the poop.  As soon as he had seen the yard mast-headed, and the ropes cleared up, he followed Tammy. He knew well enough that it would not do for the youngster to let his mind dwell too much on the poor chap on the hatch, and I found out, a little later, that he gave the boy something to occupy his thoughts.  After they had gone aft, we went into the fo'cas'le. Every one was moody and frightened. For a little while, we sat about in our bunks and on the chests, and no one said a word. The watch below were all asleep, and not one of them knew what had happened.  All at once, Plummer, whose wheel it was, stepped over the starboard washboard, into the fo'cas'le.  \"What's up, anyway?\" he asked. \"Is Williams much 'urt?\"  \"Sh!\" I said. \"You'll wake the others. Who's taken your wheel?\"  \"Tammy--ther Second sent 'im. 'e said I could go forrard an' 'ave er smoke. 'e said Williams 'ad 'ad er fall.\"  He broke off, and looked across the fo'cas'le.  \"Where is 'e?\" he inquired, in a puzzled voice.  I glanced at the others; but no one seemed inclined to start yarning about it.  \"He fell from the t'gallant rigging!\" I said.  \"Where is 'e?\" he repeated.  \"Smashed up,\" I said. \"He's lying on the hatch.\"  \"Dead?\" he asked.  I nodded.  \"I guessed 'twere somethin' pretty bad, when I saw the Old Man come forrard. 'ow did it 'appen?\"  He looked round at the lot of us sitting there silent and smoking.  \"No one knows,\" I said, and glanced at Stubbins. I caught him eyeing me, doubtfully.  After a moment's silence, Plummer spoke again.  \"I 'eard 'im screech, when I was at ther wheel. 'e must 'ave got 'urt up aloft.\"  Stubbins struck a match and proceeded to relight his pipe.  \"How d'yer mean?\" he asked, speaking for the first time.  \"'ow do I mean? Well, I can't say. Maybe 'e jammed 'is fingers between ther parrel an' ther mast.\"  \"What about 'is swearin' at ther Second Mate? Was that 'cause 'e'd jammed 'is fingers?\" put in Quoin.  \"I never 'eard about that,\" said Plummer. \"'oo 'eard 'im?  \"I should think heverybody in ther bloomin' ship heard him,\" Stubbins answered. \"All ther same, I hain't sure he _was_ swearin' at ther Second Mate. I thought at first he'd gone dotty an' was cussin' him; but somehow it don't seem likely, now I come to think. It don't stand to reason he should go to cuss ther man. There was nothin' to go cussin' about. What's more, he didn't seem ter be talkin' down to us on deck-- what I could make hout. 'sides, what would he want ter go talkin' to ther Second about his pay-day?\"  He looked across to where I was sitting. Jock, who was smoking, quietly, on the chest next to me, took his pipe slowly out from between his teeth.  \"Ye're no far oot, Stubbins, I'm thinkin'. Ye're no far oot,\" he said, nodding his head.  Stubbins still continued to gaze at me.  \"What's your idee?\" he said, abruptly.  It may have been my fancy, but it seemed to me that there was something deeper than the mere sense the question conveyed.  I glanced at him. I couldn't have said, myself, just what my idea was.  \"I don't know!\" I answered, a little adrift. \"He didn't strike me as cursing at the Second Mate. That is, I should say, after the first minute.\"  \"Just what I say,\" he replied. \"Another thing--don't it strike you as bein' bloomin' queer about Tom nearly comin' down by ther run, an' then _this?_\"  I nodded.  \"It would have been all hup with Tom, if it hadn't been for ther gasket.\"  He paused. After a moment, he went on again.  \"That was honly three or four nights ago!\"  \"Well,\" said Plummer. \"What are yer drivin' at?\"  \"Nothin',\" answered Stubbins. \"Honly it's damned queer. Looks as though ther ship might be unlucky, after all.\"  \"Well,\" agreed Plummer. \"Things 'as been a bit funny lately; and then there's what's 'appened ter-night. I shall 'ang on pretty tight ther next time I go aloft.\"  Old Jaskett took his pipe from his mouth, and sighed.  \"Things is going wrong 'most every night,\" he said, almost pathetically. \"It's as diff'rent as chalk 'n' cheese ter what it were w'en we started this 'ere trip. I thought it were all 'ellish rot about 'er bein' 'aunted; but it's not, seem'ly.\"  He stopped and expectorated.  \"She hain't haunted,\" said Stubbins. \"Leastways, not like you mean--\"  He paused, as though trying to grasp some elusive thought.  \"Eh?\" said Jaskett, in the interval.  Stubbins continued, without noticing the query. He appeared to be answering some half-formed thought in his own brain, rather than Jaskett:  \"Things is queer--an' it's been a bad job tonight. I don't savvy one bit what Williams was sayin' of hup aloft. I've thought sometimes he'd somethin' on 'is mind--\"  Then, after a pause of about half a minute, he said this:  \"_Who_ was he sayin' that to?\"  \"Eh?\" said Jaskett, again, with a puzzled expression.  \"I was thinkin',\" said Stubbins, knocking out his pipe on the edge of the chest. \"P'raps you're right, hafter all.\"     VI   _Another Man to the Wheel_  The conversation had slacked off. We were all moody and shaken, and I know I, for one, was thinking some rather troublesome thoughts.  Suddenly, I heard the sound of the Second's whistle. Then his voice came along the deck:  \"Another man to the wheel!\"  \"'e's singin' out for some one to go aft an' relieve ther wheel,\" said Quoin, who had gone to the door to listen. \"Yer'd better 'urry up, Plummer.\"  \"What's ther time?\" asked Plummer, standing up and knocking out his pipe. \"Must be close on ter four bells, 'oo's next wheel is it?\"  \"It's all right, Plummer,\" I said, getting up from the chest on which I had been sitting. \"I'll go along. It's my wheel, and it only wants a couple of minutes to four bells.\"  Plummer sat down again, and I went out of the fo'cas'le. Reaching the poop, I met Tammy on the lee side, pacing up and down.  \"Who's at the wheel?\" I asked him, in astonishment.  \"The Second Mate,\" he said, in a shaky sort of voice. \"He's waiting to be relieved. I'll tell you all about it as soon as I get a chance.\"  I went on aft to the wheel.  \"Who's that?\" the Second inquired.  \"It's Jessop, Sir,\" I answered.  He gave me the course, and then, without another word, went forrard along the poop. On the break, I heard him call Tammy's name, and then for some minutes he was talking to him; though what he was saying, I could not possibly hear. For my part, I was tremendously curious to know why the Second Mate had taken the wheel. I knew that if it were just a matter of bad steering on Tammy's part, he would not have dreamt of doing such a thing. There had been something queer happening, about which I had yet to learn; of this, I felt sure.  Presently, the Second Mate left Tammy, and commenced to walk the weather side of the deck. Once he came right aft, and, stooping down, peered under the wheel-box; but never addressed a word to me. Sometime later, he went down the weather ladder on to the main-deck. Directly afterwards, Tammy came running up to the lee side of the wheel-box.  \"I've seen it again!\" he said, gasping with sheer nervousness.  \"What?\" I said.  \"That _thing_,\" he answered. Then he leant across the wheel-box, and lowered his voice.  \"It came over the lee rail--_up out of the sea_,\" he added, with an air of telling something unbelievable.  I turned more towards him; but it was too dark to see his face with any distinctness. I felt suddenly husky. \"My God!\" I thought. And then I made a silly effort to protest; but he cut me short with a certain impatient hopelessness.  \"For God's sake, Jessop,\" he said, \"do stow all that! It's no good. I must have someone to talk to, or I shall go dotty.\"  I saw how useless it was to pretend any sort of ignorance. Indeed, really, I had known it all along, and avoided the youngster on that very account, as you know.  \"Go on,\" I said. \"I'll listen; but you'd better keep an eye for the Second Mate; he may pop up any minute.\"  For a moment, he said nothing, and I saw him peering stealthily about the poop.  \"Go on,\" I said. \"You'd better make haste, or he'll be up before you're half-way through. What was he doing at the wheel when I came up to relieve it? Why did he send you away from it?\"  \"He didn't,\" Tammy replied, turning his face towards me. \"I bunked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10966"],["title","The Ghost Pirates (#8)"],["body","from it.\"  \"What for?\" I asked.  \"Wait a minute,\" he answered, \"and I'll tell you the whole business. You know the Second Mate sent me to the wheel, after _that_--\" He nodded his head forrard.  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"Well, I'd been here about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and I was feeling rotten about Williams, and trying to forget it all and keep the ship on her course, and all that; when, all at once, I happened to glance to loo'ard, and there I saw it climbing over the rail. My God! I didn't know what to do. The Second Mate was standing forrard on the break of the poop, and I was here all by myself. I felt as if I were frozen stiff. When it came towards me, I let go of the wheel, and yelled and bunked forrard to the Second Mate. He caught hold of me and shook me; but I was so jolly frightened, I couldn't say a word. I could only keep on pointing. The Second kept asking me 'Where?' And then, all at once, I found I couldn't see the thing. I don't know whether he saw it. I'm not at all certain he did. He just told me to damn well get back to the wheel, and stop making a damned fool of myself. I said out straight I wouldn't go. So he blew his whistle, and sung out for someone to come aft and take it. Then he ran and got hold of the wheel himself. You know the rest.\"  \"You're quite sure it wasn't thinking about Williams made you imagine you saw something?\" I said, more to gain a moment to think, than because I believed that it was the case.  \"I thought you were going to listen to me, seriously!\" he said, bitterly. \"If you won't believe me; what about the chap the Second Mate saw? What about Tom? What about Williams? For goodness sake! don't try to put me off like you did last time. I nearly went cracked with wanting to tell someone who would listen to me, and wouldn't laugh. I could stand anything, but this being alone. There's a good chap, don't pretend you don't understand. Tell me what it all means. What is this horrible man that I've twice seen? You know you know something, and I believe you're afraid to tell anyone, for fear of being laughed at. Why don't you tell me? You needn't be afraid of my laughing.\"  He stopped, suddenly. For the moment, I said nothing in reply.  \"Don't treat me like a kid, Jessop!\" he exclaimed, quite passionately.  \"I won't,\" I said, with a sudden resolve to tell him everything. \"I need someone to talk to, just as badly as you do.\"  \"What does it all mean, then?\" he burst out. \"Are they real? I always used to think it was all a yarn about such things.\"  \"I'm sure I don't know what it all means, Tammy,\" I answered. \"I'm just as much in the dark, there, as you are. And I don't know whether they're real--that is, not as we consider things real. You don't know that I saw a queer figure down on the maindeck, several nights before you saw that thing up here.\"  \"Didn't you see this one?\" he cut in, quickly.  \"Yes,\" I answered.  \"Then, why did you pretend not to have?\" he said, in a reproachful voice. \"You don't know what a state you put me into, what with my being certain that I had seen it and then you being so jolly positive that there had been nothing. At one time I thought I was going clean off my dot--until the Second Mate saw that man go up the main. Then, I knew that there must be something in the thing I was certain I'd seen.\"  \"I thought, perhaps, that if I told you I hadn't seen it, you would think you'd been mistaken,\" I said. \"I wanted you to think it was imagination, or a dream, or something of that sort.\"  \"And all the time, you knew about that other thing you'd seen?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" I replied.  \"It was thundering decent of you,\" he said. \"But it wasn't any good.\"  He paused a moment. Then he went on:  \"It's terrible about Williams. Do you think he saw something, up aloft?\"  \"I don't know, Tammy,\" I said. \"It's impossible to say. It _may_ have been only an accident.\" I hesitated to tell him what I really thought.  \"What was he saying about his pay-day? Who was he saying it to?\"  \"I don't know,\" I said, again. \"He was always cracked about taking a pay-day out of her. You know, he stayed in her, on purpose, when all the others left. He told me that he wasn't going to be done out of it, for anyone.\"  \"What did the other lot leave for?\" he asked. Then, as the idea seemed to strike him--\"Jove! do you think they saw something, and got scared? It's quite possible. You know, we only joined her in 'Frisco. She had no 'prentices on the passage out. Our ship was sold; so they sent us aboard here to come home.\"  \"They may have,\" I said. \"Indeed, from things I've heard Williams say, I'm pretty certain, he for one, guessed or knew a jolly sight more than we've any idea of.\"  \"And now he's dead!\" said Tammy, solemnly. \"We'll never be able to find out from him now.\"  For a few moments, he was silent. Then he went off on another track.  \"Doesn't anything ever happen in the Mate's watch?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"There's several things happened lately, that seem pretty queer. Some of his side have been talking about them. But he's too jolly pig-headed to see anything. He just curses his chaps, and puts it all down to them.\"  \"Still,\" he persisted, \"things seem to happen more in our watch than in his--I mean, bigger things. Look at tonight.\"  \"We've no proof, you know,\" I said.  He shook his head, doubtfully.  \"I shall always funk going aloft, now.\"  \"Nonsense!\" I told him. \"It may only have been an accident.\"  \"Don't!\" he said. \"You know you don't think so, really.\"  I answered nothing, just then; for I knew very well that he was right. We were silent for a couple of moments.  Then he spoke again:  \"Is the ship haunted?\"  For an instant I hesitated.  \"No,\" I said, at length. \"I don't think she is. I mean, not in that way.\"  \"What way, then?\"  \"Well, I've formed a bit of a theory, that seems wise one minute, and cracked the next. Of course, it's as likely to be all wrong; but it's the only thing that seems to me to fit in with all the beastly things we've had lately.\"  \"Go on!\" he said, with an impatient, nervous movement.  \"Well, I've an idea that it's nothing _in_ the ship that's likely to hurt us. I scarcely know how to put it; but, if I'm right in what I think, it's the ship herself that's the cause of everything.\"  \"What do you mean?\" he asked, in a puzzled voice. \"Do you mean that the ship _is_ haunted, after all?\"  \"No!\" I answered. \"I've just told you I didn't. Wait until I've finished what I was going to say.\"  \"All right!\" he said.  \"About that thing you saw tonight,\" I went on. \"You say it came over the lee rail, up on to the poop?\"  \"Yes,\" he answered.  \"Well, the thing I saw, _came up out of the sea, and went back into the sea_.\"  \"Jove!\" he said; and then: \"Yes, go on!\"  \"My idea is, that this ship is open to be boarded by those things,\" I explained. \"What they are, of course I don't know. They look like men-- in lots of ways. But--well, the Lord knows what's in the sea. Though we don't want to go imagining silly things, of course. And then, again, you know, it seems fat-headed, calling anything silly. That's how I keep going, in a sort of blessed circle. I don't know a bit whether they're flesh and blood, or whether they're what we should call ghosts or spirits.\"  \"They can't be flesh and blood,\" Tammy interrupted. \"Where would they live? Besides, that first one I saw, I thought I could see through it. And this last one--the Second Mate would have seen it. And they would drown--\"  \"Not necessarily,\" I said.  \"Oh, but I'm sure they're not,\" he insisted. \"It's impossible--\"  \"So are ghosts--when you're feeling sensible,\" I answered. \"But I'm not saying they _are_ flesh and blood; though, at the same time, I'm not going to say straight out they're ghosts--not yet, at any rate.\"  \"Where do they come from?\" he asked, stupidly enough.  \"Out of the sea,\" I told him. \"You saw for yourself!\"  \"Then why don't other vessels have them coming aboard?\" he said. \"How do you account for that?\"  \"In a way--though sometimes it seems cracky--I think I can, according to my idea,\" I answered.  \"How?\" he inquired again.  \"Why, I believe that this ship is open, as I've told you--exposed, unprotected, or whatever you like to call it. I should say it's reasonable to think that all the things of the material world are barred, as it were, from the immaterial; but that in some cases the barrier may be broken down. That's what may have happened to this ship. And if it has, she may be naked to the attacks of beings belonging to some other state of existence.\"  \"What's made her like that?\" he asked, in a really awed sort of tone.  \"The Lord knows!\" I answered. \"Perhaps something to do with magnetic stresses; but you'd not understand, and I don't, really. And, I suppose, inside of me, I don't believe it's anything of the kind, for a minute. I'm not built that way. And yet I don't know! Perhaps, there may have been some rotten thing done aboard of her. Or, again, it's a heap more likely to be something quite outside of anything I know.\"  \"If they're immaterial then, they're spirits?\" he questioned.  \"I don't know,\" I said. \"It's so hard to say what I really think, you know. I've got a queer idea, that my head-piece likes to think good; but I don't believe my tummy believes it.\"  \"Go on!\" he said.  \"Well,\" I said. \"Suppose the earth were inhabited by two kinds of life. We're one, and _they're_ the other.\"  \"Go on!\" he said.  \"Well,\" I said. \"Don't you see, in a normal state we may not be capable of appreciating the _realness_ of the other? But they may be just as _real_ and material to _them_, as _we_ are to _us_. Do you see?\"  \"Yes,\" he said. \"Go on!\"  \"Well,\" I said. \"The earth may be just as _real_ to them, as to us. I mean that it may have qualities as material to them, as it has to us; but neither of us could appreciate the other's realness, or the quality of realness in the earth, which was real to the other. It's so difficult to explain. Don't you understand?\"  \"Yes,\" he said. \"Go on!\"  \"Well, if"]]]
