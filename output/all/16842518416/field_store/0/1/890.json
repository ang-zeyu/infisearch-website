But she must first of all get rid of this stupid trembling, which made her feel as if her limbs were not strong enough to bear the weight of her body; so sitting down at the table she prepared to get a good square meal as the first step towards the successful accomplishment of what was to come after.  Miles was a minute later in coming, because he had been attending to a customer.  \"What is the matter; is Father very bad?\" he asked, with a quaver of fear in his tone.  Accidents, or sickness of any kind, always seemed so much worse in winter, and then death and disaster had already worked havoc in the family.  \"Poor Father is bad enough, but I dare say he will do very well with care, and Nellie is a famous one for looking after sick folks,\" Katherine answered, as cheerfully as she could, quick to understand what was in the mind of Miles, and feeling genuinely sorry for him.  Then she said briskly: \"But I have gone and done a fearfully stupid thing to-night, and I want to know if you feel brave enough to help me out of a very big muddle?\"  Miles bristled up in an offended fashion.  \"I suppose I've got as much pluck as most people; anyhow I'm not quite a coward.\"  \"Of course you are not, or I should not have dreamed of asking you to help me to-night,\" Katherine said, with a nervous laugh; then in a jerky tone she went on: \"I want you to get the store shut up as soon as possible, then, directly the people have cleared off, we have got to go and bring those stores home that I had to cache.\"  \"But we can't go at night, and in a snowstorm!\" expostulated Miles; but his eyes glowed and his nostrils dilated, as if the very thought of such an expedition sent thrills of delight all through him.  \"It is not snowing so badly now, and luckily the moon will help us. Moreover, if we don't go tonight it will not be of much use to go at all; for if we wait until the morning I fancy we shall find that most of the stores have disappeared, especially the Black Crow tobacco,\" Katherine replied, then told him of the look she had seen pass between the man who wanted the tobacco and Oily Dave, after she had been so foolishly frank in explaining where the stores were to be found.  \"I'll go and shut up sharp, then we'll start as soon as possible,\" Miles said, with a jump of irrepressible joyfulness, for nothing appealed to him like adventure.  \"Don't let anyone even guess what we are going to do!\" cried Katherine, who felt that enough indiscretion had been committed that night to last them for a long time to come.  \"Trust me for that!\" replied Miles. \"I shall pull a face as long as a fiddle, and yawn my head half off while I'm clearing up.  Oh, it will be rich to out-wit that precious pair!  I had been wondering why Stee Jenkin should go off so quiet and early with Oily Dave, but I should never have guessed at the reason.  I shall be through with the shutting-up in about twenty minutes, and I've had my supper, so there won't be anything to wait for.\"  Katherine felt better when she had eaten her supper; the thought of what was before her was less of an ordeal, and she was more than ever determined that Oily Dave and the other man must be outwitted, cost what it might. There was to be no night school that night, so, directly the door of the store was shut and barred, Miles and Katherine were able to set out.  The twins were in bed, and fast asleep.  Mrs. Burton was still busy in her father's room, so there was only Phil to look after things.  \"Tell Nellie when she comes out of Father's room that Miles and I have got some work to do outside which may take us an hour or more,\" Katherine said to her youngest brother.  \"Meanwhile you must just make yourself as useful as possible--clear away supper, wash the cups and plates, take care of the fire, and look after things generally.  You will have a school holiday to-morrow, so no lessons need be learned to-night.  We shall have to do the store work while Father is ill, so you and Miles will have to be satisfied with night school with the men instead of having lessons in the day.\"  \"Hooray!\" chirruped Phil, who had no love of learning, but always yearned for action.  Then he asked anxiously: \"Couldn't you stay in and look after things to-night, while I go and help Miles with the outside work?\"  Katherine laughed and shook her head.  \"No, no, the outside work would be too heavy for you to-night; you might even get your nose frozen.  But you must stay up until we come back, because Nellie may need you to help her.\"  \"I'll stay,\" replied the boy, but he manifested so much curiosity about the nature of the outside work that had to be done that Katherine had finally to command him to stay inside the house.  Neither she nor Miles wished anyone to know what they were going to do: there were so many reasons for keeping their errand secret. Mrs. Burton would have wept and wailed at the mere thought of such a journey at night, while Phil simply could not keep a secret.  The dogs were tired and sleepy, very unwilling to be turned out and harnessed again, but directly they were fairly out of their shed the cold seemed to rouse them, and they set off at a great pace. Katherine and Miles were riding in the empty sledge now, with their snowshoes tucked in beside them.  The snow-storm had spent itself; the moon shone out of a cloudless sky, while myriads of stars lent their aid to the illumination of the night.  Even the cold was less noticeable than in the afternoon, when the damp wind blew off the water and the snow was falling so fast.  \"It was worth while your being indiscreet for once, seeing that it has brought us out on a night like this,\" Miles said, as he crouched low in the sledge, holding on with both thickly mittened hands, for Katherine was driving, and the dogs were going with leaps and bounds, which made the sledge bounce and sway in a very erratic fashion.  \"You won't say the indiscretion was worth while if it turns out that we are the second arrivals and not the first,\" Katherine answered.  But her tone was buoyant and hopeful; for she had little doubt about getting to the scene of her father's accident before Oily Dave and Stee Jenkin had succeeded in locating the spot.  \"Wolves! listen to them!\" exclaimed Miles, as a hideous yapping and howling sounded across the snowy waste.  \"They are a good way off though, and I brought a pair of Father's revolvers in case of accident,\" Katherine replied, her heart beating a little quicker, although in reality she would much rather have met two or three wolves just then than have encountered Oily Dave and the man who had wanted to buy the Black Crow tobacco.  \"I'm glad you thought to bring them,\" said Miles.  \"Nick Jones told me the wolves are uncommonly hungry for so early in the year, and they are in great numbers too.  He trapped twenty last week.\"  \"That means twenty less to bother us to-night, which is a great comfort,\" she answered, laughing nervously, for the yapping and howling seemed to be coming nearer and nearer.  Then, recognizing a landmark, she cried out joyfully: \"Oh, here is the place, and there hangs the broken snowshoe!\"  \"What is that?\" cried Miles sharply, as a shadowy something slid away out of sight among the trees, a something that was so much like its surroundings as to be hardly distinct from them.  \"A wolf.  Look at the dogs.  Mind what you are about, Miles, or they'll bolt!\" she called quickly.  They were both on the ground now, and the boy was trying to hold in the dogs, which were barking, raging, howling, and whining, making a violent uproar, and all striving to get free in order to rush at that something which had slid out of sight among the trees a minute before.  \"We must tie them up.  I can't hold the brutes.  They pull as if they were mad,\" said Miles breathlessly, while the dogs struggled and fought, nearly dragging him off his feet, as he tried to keep them from dashing away in pursuit of what they deemed a legitimate quarry.  Katherine swung a rope with a running noose over the head and shoulders of the leader, a huge white dog with a black patch on its back like a saddle.  \"There, my fine fellow; now perhaps you will understand that this is not playtime, but a working day extending into the night,\" she said, as she patted the great beast in an affectionate manner to show that it was repression, not punishment, which was intended by the tightening of the rope.  The dog whined, licking her mitten, but left off struggling, as if it realized the uselessness of such a course.  The other dogs were fastened in like manner, for they had all been trained to hunt wolves, and might bolt at an unexpected moment, wrecking the sledge and scattering the things which were loaded upon it.  Then came ten minutes of hard work clearing away the snow and getting at the packages which Katherine had been obliged to cache a few hours before.  One package had been torn open, and its contents scattered, which showed that the wolf had already started thieving operations; so that even if Oily Dave and his companion had contemplated no raid on the cache, there would not have been much left later which was worth carrying away.  \"I don't like you having to draw that sledge.  Suppose it overruns you, and you get hurt, like Father did this afternoon,\" Miles said in a troubled tone, as Katherine prepared to go forward with the hand sledge, while he followed behind with the dogs.  \"I don't intend to let it overrun me, so there is no need to worry. In fact there is much more danger for you if the dogs hear the wolves and try to bolt.  But let us get along as fast as we can, or Nellie will be in a fine state of anxiety about us,\" Katherine replied.  Then, gathering the lines of the sledge round her arms, as her father had taught her, she set out at a good pace, followed by Miles and the dogs.  For a time little was to be heard save the creaking of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11110"],["title","A Countess from Canada: A Story of Life in the Backwoods (#5)"],["body","babiche lacing of the snowshoes, for the dogs were running silently, and Miles, saving his breath for the work of getting along, was controlling them merely by dumb show, flourishing the whip to hold them back when they took on a spurt, or beckoning them along when they showed signs of lagging.  They were less than a mile from home, and going well, when suddenly a hideous uproar broke out near at hand--the long-drawn howling of wolves, human shouts and cries, and the crack of a revolver.     CHAPTER IV  A Night of Rough Work  \"Phil, where is Katherine?\" asked Mrs. Burton, coming out of her father's room about half an hour after the two had started to bring home the stores.  \"She has gone to help Miles to do some work outside, though what it can be I'm sure I don't know,\" grumbled Phil, who was sleepy and wanted to get to bed.  He had washed the supper things after a fashion, had cleared up the kitchen for the night, according to his own ideas of tidiness, and now was sitting in the rocking-chair by the stove, trying very hard to keep his eyes open.  \"Oh dear, how unwise of her!\" exclaimed Mrs. Burton in a plaintive tone.  \"I am always so afraid for her to go outside at night when it is freezing so sharply, for her face would be quite spoiled if she were to get it frostbitten, and she is so pretty.\"  \"Is she?\" Phil's voice had a drowsy drawl, as if the subject of Katherine's looks had very little interest for him, as indeed it had.  But an unexpected lurch of the chair, coming at that moment, landed him in a squirming heap on the floor.  \"Oh, Phil, I am so sorry that I upset you, dear, but I had to catch at the chair to save myself from falling over the broom!  What made you leave it lying on the floor?\" asked Mrs. Burton, who had been the innocent cause of his collapse.  Phil rose to his feet and dusted the ashes from the sleeve of his jacket with a rueful air.  \"Did I leave the broom there?  Oh, I suppose I forgot it!  I remember I had it to sweep up the fireplace, because I could not find a brush.\"  \"There is the brush hanging close to the stove,\" remarked Mrs. Burton.  Then she broke out again: \"I wonder what Katherine can be doing out-of-doors at this time of the night, and Miles too?\"  \"Perhaps they are gone to a surprise party.  Don't you remember there was one at Astor M'Kree's last winter?\" suggested Phil, whose tumble had dispelled some of his sleepiness, although he still talked in a drowsy tone, and rumpled his hair wildly all over his head.  \"Katherine would not go to a surprise party with Father lying in such a condition,\" replied Mrs. Burton severely.  Then she went on: \"Besides, she must be pretty well worn out, poor girl, for she has done thirty miles on snowshoes since the morning, with all the worry and trouble of Father's accident thrown in.\"  \"Perhaps she has gone to help Miles to look after his wolf traps. I wanted to go instead, only she wouldn't let me.  I told her that girls ought to stay indoors to wash cups and things, while boys did the outside work,\" Phil explained, in a rather injured tone.  Mrs. Burton laughed softly.  \"I'm glad Katherine did not let you turn out to-night, laddie, though I am sorry she had to go herself. Now make haste and get off to bed; I have put everything ready for you.  But you must be very quiet, because I think Father is inclined to go to sleep.\"  \"Katherine said I was not to go to bed until she came in, and I'm not so very tired,\" replied Phil, choking back a yawn with a great effort.  \"I am, though.  And if you are in Father's room I shall be able to sit down here by the stove and rest without any worry.  So run along, laddie, and be sure that you come to rouse me if Father wants me,\" Mrs. Burton said.  Then, drawing a big shawl round her shoulders, she sat down in the rocking-chair vacated by Phil to wait for the return of her sister and brother.  She wondered why they had gone out, but did not worry about it, except on the score of Katherine's complexion.  Even that ceased to trouble her, as she swayed gently to and fro in the comfortable warmth flung out by the stove, and very soon she was fast asleep.  'Duke Radford, who lay in restless discomfort from the pain of his hurts, was the first to hear sounds of an arrival, and he tried to rouse Phil to see what all the commotion was about.  But the boy always slept so heavily that it was next to impossible to wake him. The dogs were barking.  Katherine called out to Miles, who answered back.  Then there were other voices and a great banging at the door of the store.  That was when Mrs. Burton first became aware that something was going on, and started up out of the rocking-chair under the impression that she had been there the whole night and that morning had come already.  A glance at the clock showed her, however, that it was not so very late yet, and still a long way from midnight.  Then, remembering that Katherine and Miles were out, she guessed it was they who were making such a clamour at the door of the store, and hurried to let them in.  \"I hope we haven't frightened Father with all the noise we have had to make, but you seemed so dead asleep that we had to make a great riot in order to get in,\" Katherine said, as she and Miles towed the sledge inside the store to be unloaded at leisure when morning came.  \"I will go and see to Father, but Phil is with him now.  Where have you been, Katherine?  And oh, I do hope you have not frosted your face!\" Mrs. Burton said, with sisterly concern.  Katherine laughed, but even Mrs. Burton noticed that the sound was strained and unmirthful.  \"My complexion has not suffered, I can assure you.  But Nellie, dear, could you get a cup of hot coffee quickly for two men?  They have been having a rather terrible time of it, and are a good bit shaken.\"  \"Bring them into the kitchen and I will have the coffee ready directly,\" Mrs. Burton said promptly.  But first of all she just looked into her father's room to tell him there was nothing to worry about. Then she hurried into the kitchen to rouse up the fire and put the coffee pot on to boil.  Oily Dave and Stee Jenkin accepted Katherine's invitation to walk in, following her through the dark store and into the lighted room beyond with a sheepish expression on their faces, which certainly no one had ever seen there before.  Stee Jenkin had his outer garments nearly torn off him, there was blood on his face, and he sank on to the nearest bench as if his trembling limbs refused to support him any longer.  \"Why, your face is bleeding!  What have you been doing--not fighting, I hope?\" There was a touch of severity in Mrs. Burton's tone; for she knew the man did not bear a very good character, and she was not disposed to give herself much trouble on account of anyone who had brought his misfortunes upon his own head.  \"Yes, ma'am, I have been fighting, and for my life too, which is a very different thing from a round of fisticuffs with your neighbour,\" growled Stee Jenkin in a shaken tone, and the hand with which he tried to lift the steaming coffee to his lips shook so violently that he spilled the hot liquid on his clothes.  Katherine and Miles had gone back to the store again, so it was Oily Dave who explained the nature of the fight in which both men had been involved.  \"We'd a perticular bit of business on hand to-night,\" he said, in response to the enquiring look which Mrs. Burton turned upon him, for Stee was plainly too much upset to be coherent.  \"I'd got a revolver certainly, but Stee had nothing but a knife, for we didn't expect any trouble with wolves so early in the season, though it is a fact we might have done, for everyone knows the place is just about swarming with them this winter.\"  \"Did the wolves attack you?  Oh, how truly horrible!\" exclaimed Mrs. Burton, with so much genuine sympathy that both men winced under it, hardened offenders though they were; for they knew very well that they deserved the fate which had so nearly fallen upon them.  \"About ten of the cowards closed in on us as we were going through a patch of cotton woods, where we couldn't move fast because of catching our snow-shoes,\" Oily Dave went on, winking and blinking in a nervous fashion.  \"And we were fairly cornered before we knew where we were.  One great brute came at me straight in the face.  I knocked him off with my fist and fumbled for my barker, but shot wild and did no more damage than to singe the hair off another brute's back; but I managed to edge a bit closer to Stee, who was getting it rough, and hadn't even a chance to draw his knife.  But we should have been down and done for to a dead certainty, if it hadn't been for Miss Radford and Miles.  They let the dogs loose from the sledge when they heard the rumpus, and that turned the scale in our favour.  That great white dog with the black patch on its back came tearing into the cotton woods roaring like a bull, and then I can tell you there was a stampede among the brutes that were baiting us.\"  Oily Dave drew a long breath as he finished his narration, but the other man groaned.  \"Katherine, what were you doing so far away from home at this time of night?\" gasped Mrs. Burton, in a shocked tone, as her sister came into the room.  \"Why, the wolves might have attacked you.\"  \"Not likely; we had the dogs with us, you see.  But we had to go about three miles along the trail to bring home the things I had to leave behind when Father had his accident,\" said Katherine, as she stood beside the stove slowly unwinding her wraps.  Now that the strain and excitement were over, she looked white and tired, but her face was set in hard, stern lines, which for the time seemed to add years to her age.  \"It is dreadful that you should have to go out at night like that. Wouldn't to-morrow have done as well?\" asked Mrs. Burton in a tone of distress.  \"No,\" replied Katherine slowly, as she wrestled with an obstinate fastening of her coat, keeping her gaze carefully on the ground the while.  \"W"]]]
