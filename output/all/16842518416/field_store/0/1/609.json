He was the son of a clergyman; was graduated at Harvard College in 1852, and at its Divinity School in 1860; and was pastor of the Unitarian Church at Brewster, Mass., in 1862-66.  In the latter year he settled in New York and began drawing public attention to the condition and needs of street boys. He mingled with them, gained their confidence, showed a personal concern in their affairs, and stimulated them to honest and useful living. With his first story he won the hearts of all red-blooded boys everywhere, and of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies were sold during the author's lifetime.  In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, bald-headed man, with cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused all who met him. He died at Natick, Mass., July 18, 1899.  Mr. Alger's stories are as popular now as when first published, because they treat of real live boys who were always up and about--just like the boys found everywhere to-day. They are pure in tone and inspiring in influence, and many reforms in the juvenile life of New York may be traced to them. Among the best known are:  _Strong and Steady; Strive and Succeed; Try and Trust; Bound to Rise; Risen from the Ranks; Herbert Carter's Legacy; Brave and Bold; Jack's Ward; Shifting for Himself; Wait and Hope; Paul the Peddler; Phil the Fiddler; Slow and Sure; Julius the Street Boy; Tom the Bootblack; Struggling Upward; Facing the World; The Cash Boy; Making His Way; Tony the Tramp; Joe's Luck; Do and Dare; Only an Irish Boy; Sink or Swim; A Cousin's Conspiracy; Andy Gordon; Bob Burton; Harry Vane; Hector's Inheritance; Mark Mason's Triumph; Sam's Chance; The Telegraph Boy; The Young Adventurer; The Young Outlaw; The Young Salesman_, and _Luke Walton_.       JACK'S WARD     CHAPTER I  JACK HARDING GETS A JOB   \"Look here, boy, can you hold my horse a few minutes?\" asked a gentleman, as he jumped from his carriage in one of the lower streets in New York.  The boy addressed was apparently about twelve, with a bright face and laughing eyes, but dressed in clothes of coarse material. This was Jack Harding, who is to be our hero.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Jack, with alacrity, hastening to the horse's head; \"I'll hold him as long as you like.\"  \"All right! I'm going in at No. 39; I won't be long.\"  \"That's what I call good luck,\" said Jack to himself. \"No boy wants a job more than I do. Father's out of work, rent's most due, and Aunt Rachel's worrying our lives out with predicting that we'll all be in the poorhouse inside of three months. It's enough to make a fellow feel blue, listenin' to her complainin' and groanin' all the time. Wonder whether she was always so. Mother says she was disappointed in love when she was young. I guess that's the reason.\"  \"Have you set up a carriage, Jack?\" asked a boy acquaintance, coming up and recognizing Jack.  \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"but it ain't for long. I shall set down again pretty soon.\"  \"I thought your grandmother had left you a fortune, and you had set up a team.\"  \"No such good news. It belongs to a gentleman that's inside.\"  \"Inside the carriage?\"  \"No, in No. 39.\"  \"How long's he going to stay?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"If it was half an hour, we might take a ride, and be back in time.\"  Jack shook his head.  \"That ain't my style,\" he said. \"I'll stay here till he comes out.\"  \"Well, I must be going along. Are you coming to school to-morrow?\"  \"Yes, if I can't get anything to do.\"  \"Are you trying for that?\"  \"I'd like to get a place. Father's out of work, and anything I can earn comes in handy.\"  \"My father's got plenty of money,\" said Frank Nelson, complacently. \"There isn't any need of my working.\"  \"Then your father's lucky.\"  \"And so am I.\"  \"I don't know about that. I'd just as lieve work as not.\"  \"Well, I wouldn't. I'd rather be my own master, and have my time to myself. But I must be going home.\"  \"You're lazy, Frank.\"  \"Very likely. I've a right to be.\"  Frank Nelson went off, and Jack was left alone. Half an hour passed, and still the gentleman, who had entered No. 39, didn't appear. The horse showed signs of impatience, shook his head, and eyed Jack in an unfriendly manner.  \"He thinks it time to be going,\" thought Jack. \"So do I. I wonder what the man's up to. Perhaps he's spending the day.\"  Fifteen minutes more passed, but then relief came. The owner of the carriage came out.  \"Did you get tired of waiting for me?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Jack, shrewdly. \"I knew the longer the job, the bigger the pay.\"  \"I suppose that is a hint,\" said the gentleman, not offended.  \"Perhaps so,\" said Jack, and he smiled too.  \"Tell me, now, what are you going to do with the money I give you--buy candy?\"  \"No,\" answered Jack, \"I shall carry it home to my mother.\"  \"That's well. Does your mother need the money?\"  \"Yes, sir. Father's out of work, and we've got to live all the same.\"  \"What's your father's business?\"  \"He's a cooper.\"  \"So he's out of work?\"  \"Yes, sir, and has been for six weeks. It's on account of the panic, I suppose.\"  \"Very likely. He has plenty of company just now.\"  It may be remarked that our story opens in the year 1867, memorable for its panic, and the business depression which followed. Nearly every branch of industry suffered, and thousands of men were thrown out of work, and utterly unable to find employment of any kind. Among them was Timothy Harding, the father of our hero. He was a sober, steady man, and industrious; but his wages had never been large, and he had been unable to save up a reserve fund, on which to draw in time of need. He had an excellent wife, and but one child--our present hero; but there was another, and by no means unimportant member of the family. This was Rachel Harding, a spinster of melancholy temperament, who belonged to that unhappy class who are always prophesying evil, and expecting the worst. She had been \"disappointed\" in early life, and this had something to do with her gloomy views, but probably she was somewhat inclined by nature to despondency.  The family lived in a humble tenement, which, however, was neatly kept, and would have been a cheerful home but for the gloomy presence of Aunt Rachel, who, since her brother had been thrown out of employment, was gloomier than ever.  But all this while we have left Jack and the stranger standing in the street.  \"You seem to be a good boy,\" said the latter, \"and, under the circumstances, I will pay you more than I intended.\"  He drew from his vest pocket a dollar bill, and handed it to Jack.  \"What! is all this for me?\" asked Jack, joyfully.  \"Yes, on the condition that you carry it home, and give it to your mother.\"  \"That I will, sir; she'll be glad enough to get it.\"  \"Well, good-by, my boy. I hope your father'll find work soon.\"  \"He's a trump!\" ejaculated Jack. \"Wasn't it lucky I was here just as he wanted a boy to hold his horse. I wonder what Aunt Rachel will have to say to that? Very likely she'll say the bill is bad.\"  Jack made the best of his way home. It was already late in the afternoon, and he knew he would be expected. It was with a lighter heart than usual that he bent his steps homeward, for he knew that the dollar would be heartily welcome.  We will precede him, and give a brief description of his home.  There were only five rooms, and these were furnished in the plainest manner. In the sitting room were his mother and aunt. Mrs. Harding was a motherly-looking woman, with a pleasant face, the prevailing expression of which was a serene cheerfulness, though of late it had been harder than usual to preserve this, in the straits to which the family had been reduced. She was setting the table for tea.  Aunt Rachel sat in a rocking-chair at the window. She was engaged in knitting. Her face was long and thin, and, as Jack expressed it, she looked as if she hadn't a friend in the world. Her voice harmonized with her mournful expression, and was equally doleful.  \"I wonder why Jack don't come home?\" said Mrs. Harding, looking at the clock. \"He's generally here at this time.\"  \"Perhaps somethin's happened,\" suggested her sister-in-law.  \"What do you mean, Rachel?\"  \"I was reading in the _Sun_ this morning about a boy being run over out West somewhere.\"  \"You don't think Jack has been run over!\"  \"Who knows?\" said Rachel, gloomily. \"You know how careless boys are, and Jack's very careless.\"  \"I don't see how you can look for such things, Rachel.\"  \"Accidents are always happening; you know that yourself, Martha. I don't say Jack's run over. Perhaps he's been down to the wharves, and tumbled over into the water and got drowned.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't say such things, Rachel. They make me feel uncomfortable.\"  \"We may as well be prepared for the worst,\" said Rachel, severely.  \"Not this time, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Harding, brightly, \"for that's Jack's step outside. He isn't drowned or run over, thank God!\"  \"I hear him,\" said Rachel, dismally. \"Anybody might know by the noise who it is. He always comes stamping along as if he was paid for makin' a noise. Anybody ought to have a cast-iron head that lives anywhere within his hearing.\"  Here Jack entered, rather boisterously, it must be admitted, in his eagerness slamming the door behind him.     CHAPTER II  THE EVENTS OF AN EVENING   \"I am glad you've come, Jack,\" said his mother. \"Rachel was just predicting that you were run over or drowned.\"  \"I hope you're not very much disappointed to see me safe and well, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, merrily. \"I don't think I've been drowned.\"  \"There's things worse than drowning,\" replied Rachel, severely.  \"Such as what?\"  \"A man that's born to be hanged"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10729"],["title","Jack's Ward; Or, The Boy Guardian (#1)"],["body","safe from drowning.\"  \"Thank you for the compliment, Aunt Rachel, if you mean me. But, mother, I didn't tell you of my good luck. See this,\" and he displayed the dollar bill.  \"How did you get it?\" asked his mother.  \"Holding horses. Here, take it, mother; I warrant you'll find a use for it.\"  \"It comes in good time,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"We're out of flour, and I had no money to buy any. Before you take off your boots, Jack, I wish you'd run over to the grocery store, and buy half a dozen pounds. You may get a pound of sugar, and quarter of a pound of tea also.\"  \"You see the Lord hasn't forgotten us,\" she remarked, as Jack started on his errand.  \"What's a dollar?\" said Rachel, gloomily. \"Will it carry us through the winter?\"  \"It will carry us through to-night, and perhaps Timothy will have work to-morrow. Hark, that's his step.\"  At this moment the outer door opened, and Timothy Harding entered, not with the quick, elastic step of one who brings good tidings, but slowly and deliberately, with a quiet gravity of demeanor in which his wife could read only too well that he had failed in his efforts to procure work.  Reading all this in his manner, she had the delicacy to forbear intruding upon him questions to which she saw it would only give him pain to reply.  Not so Aunt Rachel.  \"I needn't ask,\" she began, \"whether you've got work, Timothy. I knew beforehand you wouldn't. There ain't no use in tryin'! The times is awful dull, and mark my words, they'll be wuss before they're better. We mayn't live to see 'em. I don't expect we shall. Folks can't live without money; and if we can't get that, we shall have to starve.\"  \"Not so bad as that, Rachel,\" said the cooper, trying to look cheerful; \"I don't talk about starving till the time comes. Anyhow,\" glancing at the table, on which was spread a good plain meal, \"we needn't talk about starving till to-morrow with that before us. Where's Jack?\"  \"Gone after some flour,\" replied his wife.  \"On credit?\" asked the cooper.  \"No, he's got money enough to pay for a few pounds,\" said Mrs. Harding, smiling with an air of mystery.  \"Where did it come from?\" asked Timothy, who was puzzled, as his wife anticipated. \"I didn't know you had any money in the house.\"  \"No more we had; but he earned it himself, holding horses, this afternoon.\"  \"Come, that's good,\" said the cooper, cheerfully. \"We ain't so bad off as we might be, you see, Rachel.\"  \"Very likely the bill's bad,\" she said, with the air of one who rather hoped it was.  \"Now, Rachel, what's the use of anticipating evil?\" said Mrs. Harding. \"You see you're wrong, for here's Jack with the flour.\"  The family sat down to supper.  \"You haven't told us,\" said Mrs. Harding, seeing her husband's cheerfulness in a measure restored, \"what Mr. Blodgett said about the chances for employment.\"  \"Not much that was encouraging,\" answered Timothy. \"He isn't at all sure when it will be safe to commence work; perhaps not before spring.\"  \"Didn't I tell you so?\" commented Rachel, with sepulchral sadness.  Even Mrs. Harding couldn't help looking sober.  \"I suppose, Timothy, you haven't formed any plans,\" she said.  \"No, I haven't had time. I must try to get something else to do.\"  \"What, for instance?\"  \"Anything by which I can earn a little; I don't care if it's only sawing wood. We shall have to get along as economically as we can--cut our coat according to our cloth.\"  \"Oh, you'll be able to earn something, and we can live very plain,\" said Mrs. Harding, affecting a cheerfulness she didn't feel.  \"Pity you hadn't done it sooner,\" was the comforting suggestion of Rachel.  \"Mustn't cry over spilt milk,\" said the cooper, good-humoredly. \"Perhaps we might have lived a leetle more economically, but I don't think we've been extravagant.\"  \"Besides, I can earn something, father,\" said Jack, hopefully. \"You know I did this afternoon.\"  \"So you can,\" said his mother, brightly.  \"There ain't horses to hold every day,\" said Rachel, apparently fearing that the family might become too cheerful, when, like herself, it was their duty to be profoundly gloomy.  \"You're always tryin' to discourage people, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, discontentedly.  Rachel took instant umbrage at these words.  \"I'm sure,\" said she, mournfully, \"I don't want to make you unhappy. If you can find anything to be cheerful about when you're on the verge of starvation, I hope you'll enjoy yourselves, and not mind me. I'm a poor, dependent creetur, and I feel I'm a burden.\"  \"Now, Rachel, that's all foolishness,\" said Timothy. \"You don't feel anything of the kind.\"  \"Perhaps others can tell how I feel better than I can myself,\" answered his sister, with the air of a martyr. \"If it hadn't been for me, I know you'd have been able to lay up money, and have something to carry you through the winter. It's hard to be a burden on your relations, and bring a brother's family to this poverty.\"  \"Don't talk of being a burden, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"You've been a great help to me in many ways. That pair of stockings, now, you're knitting for Jack--that's a help, for I couldn't have got time for them myself.\"  \"I don't expect,\" said Aunt Rachel, in the same sunny manner, \"that I shall be able to do it long. From the pains I have in my hands sometimes, I expect I'm goin' to lose the use of 'em soon, and be as useless as old Mrs. Sprague, who for the last ten years of her life had to sit with her hands folded on her lap. But I wouldn't stay to be a burden--I'd go to the poorhouse first. But perhaps,\" with the look of a martyr, \"they wouldn't want me there, because I'd be discouragin' 'em too much.\"  Poor Jack, who had so unwittingly raised this storm, winced under the last words, which he knew were directed at him.  \"Then why,\" asked he, half in extenuation, \"why don't you try to look pleasant and cheerful? Why won't you be jolly, as Tom Piper's aunt is?\"  \"I dare say I ain't pleasant,\" said Rachel, \"as my own nephew twits me with it. There is some folks that can be cheerful when their house is a-burnin' down before their eyes, and I've heard of one young man that laughed at his aunt's funeral,\" directing a severe glance at Jack; \"but I'm not one of that kind. I think, with the Scriptures, that there's a time to weep.\"  \"Doesn't it say there's a time to laugh, too?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  \"When I see anything to laugh about, I'm ready to laugh,\" said Aunt Rachel; \"but human nater ain't to be forced. I can't see anything to laugh at now, and perhaps you won't by and by.\"  It was evidently quite useless to persuade Rachel to cheerfulness, and the subject dropped.  The tea things were cleared away by Mrs. Harding, who then sat down to her sewing. Aunt Rachel continued to knit in grim silence, while Jack seated himself on a three-legged stool near his aunt, and began to whittle out a boat, after a model lent him by Tom Piper, a young gentleman whose aunt has already been referred to.  The cooper took out his spectacles, wiped them carefully with his handkerchief, and as carefully adjusted them to his nose. He then took down from the mantelpiece one of the few books belonging to his library--\"Dr. Kane's Arctic Explorations\"--and began to read, for the tenth time, it might be, the record of these daring explorers.  The plain little room presented a picture of graceful tranquillity, but it proved to be only the calm which preceded the storm.  The storm in question, I regret to say, was brought about by the luckless Jack. As has been said, he was engaged in constructing a boat, the particular operation he was now intent upon being the excavation, or hollowing out. Now three-legged stools are not the most secure seats in the world. This, I think, no one will deny who has any practical acquaintance with them. Jack was working quite vigorously, the block from which the boat was to be fashioned being held firmly between his knees. His knife having got wedged in the wood, he made an unusual effort to draw it out, in which he lost his balance, and disturbed the equilibrium of his stool, which, with its load, tumbled over backward. Now, it very unfortunately happened that Aunt Rachel sat close behind, and the treacherous stool came down with considerable force upon her foot.  A piercing shriek was heard, and Aunt Rachel, lifting her foot, clung to it convulsively, while an expression of pain disturbed her features.  At the sound, the cooper hastily removed his spectacles, and, letting \"Dr. Kane\" fall to the floor, started up in great dismay. Mrs. Harding likewise dropped her sewing, and jumped to her feet in alarm.  It did not take long to see how matters stood.  \"Hurt ye much, Rachel?\" inquired Timothy.  \"It's about killed me,\" groaned the afflicted maiden. \"Oh, I shall have to have my foot cut off, or be a cripple anyway.\" Then, turning upon Jack fiercely: \"You careless, wicked, ungrateful boy, that I've been wearin' myself out knittin' for. I'm almost sure you did it a purpose. You won't be satisfied till you've got me out of the world, and then--then, perhaps\"--here Rachel began to whimper--\"perhaps you'll get Tom Piper's aunt to knit your stockings.\"  \"I didn't mean to, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, penitently, eying his aunt, who was rocking to and fro in her chair. \"You know I didn't. Besides, I hurt myself like thunder,\" rubbing himself vigorously.  \"Served you right,\" said his aunt, still clasping her foot.  \"Shan't I get something for you to put on it, Rachel?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  But this Rachel steadily refused, and, after a few more postures indicating a great amount of anguish, limped out of the room, and ascended the stairs to her own apartment.     CHAPTER III  JACK'S NEW PLAN   Aunt Rachel was right in one thing, as Jack realized. He could not find horses to hold every day, and even if he had succeeded in that, few would have paid him so munificently as the stranger of the day before. In fact, matters came to a crisis, and something must be sold to raise funds for immediate necessities."]]]
