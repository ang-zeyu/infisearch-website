Just then our own artillery came thundering up, occupied a little hill in the rear and opened fire on the enemy.  The moral effect of the thundering of one's own artillery is most extraordinary, and many of us thought that we had never heard any more welcome sound than the deep roaring and crashing that started in at our rear.  It quickly helped to disperse the nervousness caused by the first entering into battle and to restore self control and confidence.  Besides, by getting into action, our artillery was now focusing the attention and drawing the fire of the Russian guns, for most of the latter's shells whined harmlessly above us, being aimed at the batteries in our rear.  Considerably relieved by this diversion, we resumed our forward movement after about fifteen minutes of further rest, our goal being the little chain of hills which our advance guard had previously occupied pending our arrival.  Here we were ordered to take up positions and dig trenches, any further advance being out of the question, as the Russian artillery overlooked and commanded the entire plain stretching in front of us.  We started at once to dig our trenches, half of my platoon stepping forward abreast, the men being placed an arm's length apart.  After laying their rifles down, barrels pointing to the enemy, a line was drawn behind the row of rifles and parallel to it.  Then each man would dig up the ground, starting from his part of the line backwards, throwing forward the earth removed, until it formed a sort of breastwork.  The second half of the platoon was meanwhile resting in the rear, rifle in hand and ready for action.  After a half hour they took the place of the first division at work, and vice versa.  Within an hour work on the trenches was so far advanced that they could be deepened while standing in them.  Such an open trench affords sufficient shelter against rifle bullets striking from the front and can be made in a measure shell proof by being covered with boards, if at hand, and with sod.  In the western area of the theater of war, in France and Flanders, where whole armies were deadlocked, facing each other for weeks without shifting their position an inch, such trenches become an elaborate affair, with extensive underground working and wing connections of lines which almost constitute little fortresses and afford a certain measure of comfort.  But where we were in Galicia at the beginning of the war, with conditions utterly unsteady and positions shifting daily and hourly, only the most superficial trenches were used.  In fact, we thought ourselves fortunate if we could requisition enough straw to cover the bottom.  That afternoon we had about half finished our work when our friend the aeroplane appeared on the horizon again.  This time we immediately opened fire.  It disappeared, but apparently had seen enough, for very soon our position was shelled.  By this time, however, shrapnel had almost ceased to be a source of concern to us and we scarcely paid any attention to it.  Human nerves quickly get accustomed to the most unusual conditions and circumstances and I noticed that quite a number of men actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion in the trenches, in spite of the roaring of the cannon about us and the whizzing of shrapnel over our heads.  I, too, soon got accustomed to the deadly missiles,--in fact, I had already started to make observations of their peculiarities.  My ear, accustomed to differentiate sounds of all kinds, had some time ago, while we still advanced, noted a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produced by the different shells in their rapid flight through the air as they passed over our heads, some sounding shrill, with a rising tendency, and the others rather dull, with a falling cadence.  A short observation revealed the fact that the passing of a dull-sounding shell was invariably preceded by a flash from one of our own cannon in the rear on the hill, which conclusively proved it to be an Austrian shell.  It must be understood that as we were advancing between the positions of the Austrian and Russian artillery, both kinds of shells were passing over our heads.  As we advanced the difference between shrill and dull shell grew less and less perceptible, until I could hardly tell them apart.  Upon nearing the hill the difference increased again more and more until on the hill itself it was very marked.  After our trench was finished I crawled to the top of the hill until I could make out the flash of the Russian guns on the opposite heights and by timing flash and actual passing of the shell, found to my astonishment that now the Russian missiles had become dull, while on the other hand, the shrill shell was invariably heralded by a flash from one of our guns, now far in the rear.  What had happened was this: Every shell describes in its course a parabolic line, with the first half of the curve ascending and the second one descending.  Apparently in the first half of its curve, that is, its course while ascending, the shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadence, which changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points downward again.  The acme for both kinds of shells naturally was exactly the half distance between the Russian and Austrian artillery and this was the point where I had noticed that the difference was the least marked.  A few days later, in talking over my observation with an artillery officer, I was told the fact was known that the shells sounded different going up than when coming down, but this knowledge was not used for practical purposes.  When I told him that I could actually determine by the sound the exact place where a shell coming from the opposing batteries was reaching its acme, he thought that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the opposing battery was hidden and thus could be located.  He apparently spoke to his commander about me, for a few days later I was sent on a reconnoitering tour, with the object of marking on the map the exact spot where I thought the hostile shells were reaching their acme, and it was later on reported to me that I had succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian guns.  I have gone into this matter at some length, because it is the only instance where my musical ear was of value during my service.  To return to my narrative, the losses which my battalion suffered that day seemed extraordinarily small when compared with the accuracy of the Russian artillery's aim and the number of missiles they fired.  I counted seventy-four shrapnel that burst in a circle of half a mile around us in about two hours, and yet we had no more than about eighteen casualties.  The most difficult part was to lie still and motionless while death was being dealt all about us and it was then and there that I had my first experience of seeing death next to me.  A soldier of my platoon, while digging in the trench, suddenly leaned back, began to cough like an old man, a little blood broke from his lips, and he crumpled together in a heap and lay quite still. I could not realize that this was the end, for his eyes were wide open and his face wore the stamp of complete serenity.  Apparently he had not suffered at all.  The man had been a favorite with all his fellows by reason of his good humor, and that he was now stretched out dead seemed unbelievable.  I saw a great many men die afterwards, some suffering horribly, but I do not recall any death that affected me quite so much as that of this first victim in my platoon.    II    The artillery duel died out with the coming of darkness and we settled down to rest, half of the men taking watch while the others slept.  At five o'clock in the morning our regiment suddenly received the order to fall in, and, together with two other regiments, was drawn out of the fighting line.  Our commanding general had received news that an isolated detachment on the extreme right wing of our army, about fifteen miles east of us, had been entirely surrounded by a strong Russian body, and we were ordered to relieve them.  It must not be forgotten that our men had been under a most incredible strain for the last three days with barely any rest during the nights and not more than one meal a day.  They had actually welcomed entering the firing line, as a relief from the fatigues of marching with their heavy burdens.  It is curious how indifferent one becomes to danger if one's organism is worn down and brain and faculty of perception numbed by physical exertion.  It was, therefore, with badly broken-down strength that we started on this relief expedition, and it was good to see how unflinchingly the soldiers undertook their unexpected new task.  All we had to say to our men was: \"Boys, your brothers are needing you.  They are cut off from all possible relief unless you bring it.  Their lives are at stake, and as they are defending one of the most strategically important points--the right wing of our army--you can turn the tide of the whole battle in our favor; so go on.\" And on they went, staggering and stumbling, and at the end of a few hours almost crawling, but ever forward.  Suddenly we came up with another regiment which had been called to the same task, and the colonel of the new regiment, being older in rank than our colonel, took command of the newly formed brigade of two regiments.  My company happened to march at the head of the regiment and the new brigadier rode for some time alongside of me.  I was deeply impressed by his firm military and yet unassuming bearing and his deep glowing enthusiasm for his army and his men. He told me with pride that two of his sons were serving in the army, too, one as an artillery officer and the other one as an officer with the sappers.  We were then approaching the point"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10967"],["title","Four Weeks in the Trenches: The War Story of a Violinist (#3)"],["body","we could hear distinctly the fire of our own batteries and the answer from the Russians, and here and there a volley of rifle fire.  Our colonel urged us on to renewed energy, and knowledge that we were nearing our goal, seemed to give new strength to our men.  Already we were witnessing evidences of the first fight that had passed here, for wounded men constantly passed us on stretchers.  Suddenly I saw the face of the colonel riding next to me, light up with excitement as a wounded man was borne past.  He addressed a few words to the stretcher-bearers and then turned to me, saying: \"The regiment of my son is fighting on the hill.  It is one of their men they have brought by.\" He urged us on again, and it seemed to me as if I noticed--or was it my imagination--a new note of appeal in his face. Suddenly another stretcher was brought past.  The colonel at my side jumped from his horse, crying out, \"My boy,\" and a feeble voice answered, \"Father.\" We all stopped as if a command had been given, to look at the young officer who lay on the stretcher, his eyes all aglow with enthusiasm and joy, unmindful of his own wound as he cried out, \"Father, how splendid that the relief should just come from you! Go on.  We held out splendidly.  All we need is ammunition and a little moral support.  Go on, don't stop for me, I am all right.\" The old colonel stood like a statue of bronze.  His face had become suddenly ashen gray.  He looked at the doctor and tried to catch his expression.  The doctor seemed grave.  But the young man urged us on, saying, \"Go on, go on, I'll be all right to-morrow.\" The whole incident had not lasted more than five minutes, barely longer than it takes to write it.  The colonel mounted his horse, sternly commanding us to march forward, but the light had died out of his eyes.  Within the next ten minutes a hail of shrapnel was greeting us, but hardly any one of us was conscious of it, so terribly and deeply were we affected by the scene of tragedy that had just been enacted before us.  I remember foolishly mumbling something to the silent man riding next to me, something about the power of recuperation of youth, about the comparative harmlessness of the pointed, steelmantled rifle bullets which on account of their terrific percussion make small clean wounds and rarely cause splintering of the bone or blood poisoning.  I remember saying that I had quite a medical knowledge and that it seemed to me that his son was not mortally wounded.  But he knew better.  He never said a word, only, a few minutes later, \"He was my only hope\"; and I can't express how ominous that word \"was\" sounded to me.  But just then the command to deploy was given and the excitement that followed drowned for the time being all melancholy thoughts.  We quickly ascended the hill where the isolated detachment of Austrians had kept the Russians at bay for fully twenty-four hours and opened fire on the enemy, while the second regiment tried to turn his left flank. The Russians slowly fell back but we followed them, and a sort of running fight ensued, during which my regiment lost about fifty-- dead and wounded.  The Russians temporarily resisted again, but soon the pressure from our other regiment on their flank began to be felt and they fled rather disorderly, leaving two machine guns, some ammunition, and four carriages full of provisions in our hands, while the regiment which had executed the flanking movement took two hundred and forty prisoners.  Around eight o'clock at night the fight was stopped for want of light, and we took up our newly acquired positions, entrenched them well, and began to make ready for the night.  Orders for outpost duty were given and the officers were again called to the brigadier- colonel, who in a few words outlined the situation to us, thanking us for the pertinacity and bravery shown by the troops, and adding that the success of the expedition lay in the fact that we had arrived in time to save the situation.  Then the question of transporting prisoners to the rear came up, and while the brigadier's eyes were searching us I felt that he was going to entrust me with that mission.  He looked at me, gave me the order in a short, measured way, but his eyes gazed searchingly and deeply into mine, and I thought I understood the unspoken message.  So, tired as I was, I immediately set out with a guard of twenty men to transport the two hundred and forty Russian prisoners, among whom were two officers, back behind the fighting line.  They seemed not unhappy over their lot--in fact, were smoking and chatting freely while we marched back.  One of the Russian officers had a wound in his leg and was carried on a stretcher, but he, too, seemed quite at ease, conversing with me in French and congratulating me upon the bravery our isolated detachment had shown against the terrific onslaught.  As soon as I had delivered them safely into the hands of the commander of our reserves, I inquired the way to the nearest field hospital in search of the young officer, the son of our brigadier-colonel.  It was then about nine o'clock at night, and on entering the peasant's hut where the field hospital was established, I saw at a glance that I had come too late. He lay there still, hands folded over his breast with as serene and happy an expression as if asleep.  His faithful orderly sat weeping next to him, and some kind hand had laid a small bunch of field flowers on his breast.  From the doctor I got the full information.  He had received a shot in the abdomen and a rifle bullet had grazed his cheek.  His last words had been a fervent expression of joy over the relief brought by his father and the knowledge that the position would not be taken by the Russians.  He had died as simply as a child, without regret, and utterly happy.  I took the orderly with me, asking him to carry all the belongings of the young officer with him in order to transmit them to his father.  When I returned with the orderly, the brigadier was issuing orders to his officers and conferring with them about the military situation.  He saw me come, yet not a muscle moved in his face, nor did he interrupt his conversation.  I was overwhelmed by the power this man showed at that minute, and admit I had not the courage to break the news to him, but it was unnecessary, for he understood. The faithful orderly stepped forward, as I had bidden him, presenting to the old man the pocketbook and small articles that belonged to his son.  While he did so he broke forth into sobs, lamenting aloud the loss of his beloved lieutenant, yet not a muscle moved in the face of the father.  He took my report, nodded curtly, dismissed me without a word, and turned back to his ordnance officers, resuming the conversation.  I assumed the command of my platoon which in the mean time had been assigned to do some outpost duty under the command of the sergeant.  I inquired about their position and went out to join them. About midnight we were relieved, and when marching back, passed the place where the tent of the brigadier had been erected.  I saw a dark figure lying on the floor, seemingly in deep sleep, and ordering my men to march on I crept silently forward.  Then I saw that his shoulders were convulsively shaking and I knew that the mask of iron had fallen at last.  The night was chilly so I entered his tent in search of his overcoat and laid it around his shoulders.  He never noticed it.  The next morning when I saw him his face was as immovable as it had been the night before, but he seemed to have aged by many years.  The next day was a comparatively restful one.  We fortified the entrenchments which we had taken, and as our battle lines were extended to the right, from being the extreme right we became almost the center of the new position which extended for perhaps ten miles from northwest to southeast about eighteen miles south of Lemberg.  The next few days were given to repairs, provisioning, and resting, with occasional small skirmishes and shifting of positions.  Then one night a scouting aeroplane brought news of a forward movement of about five Russian army corps, which seemed to push in the direction of our center.  Against this force we could muster only about two army corps, but our strategical position seemed a very good one, both the extreme flanks of our army being protected by large and impassable swamps.  Evidently the Russians had realized the impossibility of turning our flanks and were endeavoring to pierce our center by means of a vigorous frontal attack, relying upon their great superiority in numbers.  Every preparation had been made to meet the onslaught during the night.  Our trenches had been strengthened, the artillery had been brought into position, cleverly masked by means of transplanted bushes, the field in front of us had been cleared of objects obstructing the view, and the sappers had been feverishly busy constructing formidable barbed-wire entanglements and carefully measuring the shooting distances, marking the different ranges by bundles of hay or other innocent-looking objects, which were placed here and there in the field.  At nine o'clock in the morning everything was ready to receive the enemy, the men taking a short and well-deserved rest in their trenches, while we officers were called to the colonel, who acquainted us with the general situation, and, giving his orders, addressed us in a short, business-like way, appealing to our sense of duty and expressing his firm belief in our victory.  We all knew that his martial attitude and abrupt manner were a mask to hide his inner self, full of throbbing emotion and tender solicitude for his subordinates, and we returned to our trenches deeply moved.  The camp was absolutely quiet, the only movements noticeable being around the field kitchens in the rear, which were being removed from the battle line.  A half hour later any casual observer, glancing over the deserted fields might"]]]
