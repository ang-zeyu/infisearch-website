Meanwhile, shouldering the packs between them, each man carrying his own rifle, they followed the slender trail over rocks and fallen trunks and across half-frozen swamps; skirting numerous lakes that fairly gemmed the forest, their borders fringed with mist; and towards five o'clock found themselves suddenly on the edge of the woods, looking out across a large sheet of water in front of them, dotted with pine-clad islands of all describable shapes and sizes.  \"Fifty Island Water,\" announced Défago wearily, \"and the sun jest goin' to dip his bald old head into it!\" he added, with unconscious poetry; and immediately they set about pitching camp for the night.  In a very few minutes, under those skilful hands that never made a movement too much or a movement too little, the silk tent stood taut and cozy, the beds of balsam boughs ready laid, and a brisk cooking fire burned with the minimum of smoke. While the young Scotchman cleaned the fish they had caught trolling behind the canoe, Défago \"guessed\" he would \"jest as soon\" take a turn through the Bush for indications of moose. \"_May_ come across a trunk where they bin and rubbed horns,\" he said, as he moved off, \"or feedin' on the last of the maple leaves\"--and he was gone.  His small figure melted away like a shadow in the dusk, while Simpson noted with a kind of admiration how easily the forest absorbed him into herself. A few steps, it seemed, and he was no longer visible.  Yet there was little underbrush hereabouts; the trees stood somewhat apart, well spaced; and in the clearings grew silver birch and maple, spearlike and slender, against the immense stems of spruce and hemlock. But for occasional prostrate monsters, and the boulders of grey rock that thrust uncouth shoulders here and there out of the ground, it might well have been a bit of park in the Old Country. Almost, one might have seen in it the hand of man. A little to the right, however, began the great burnt section, miles in extent, proclaiming its real character--_brulé_, as it is called, where the fires of the previous year had raged for weeks, and the blackened stumps now rose gaunt and ugly, bereft of branches, like gigantic match heads stuck into the ground, savage and desolate beyond words. The perfume of charcoal and rain-soaked ashes still hung faintly about it.  The dusk rapidly deepened; the glades grew dark; the crackling of the fire and the wash of little waves along the rocky lake shore were the only sounds audible. The wind had dropped with the sun, and in all that vast world of branches nothing stirred. Any moment, it seemed, the woodland gods, who are to be worshipped in silence and loneliness, might stretch their mighty and terrific outlines among the trees. In front, through doorways pillared by huge straight stems, lay the stretch of Fifty Island Water, a crescent-shaped lake some fifteen miles from tip to tip, and perhaps five miles across where they were camped. A sky of rose and saffron, more clear than any atmosphere Simpson had ever known, still dropped its pale streaming fires across the waves, where the islands--a hundred, surely, rather than fifty--floated like the fairy barques of some enchanted fleet. Fringed with pines, whose crests fingered most delicately the sky, they almost seemed to move upwards as the light faded--about to weigh anchor and navigate the pathways of the heavens instead of the currents of their native and desolate lake.  And strips of colored cloud, like flaunting pennons, signaled their departure to the stars....  The beauty of the scene was strangely uplifting. Simpson smoked the fish and burnt his fingers into the bargain in his efforts to enjoy it and at the same time tend the frying pan and the fire. Yet, ever at the back of his thoughts, lay that other aspect of the wilderness: the indifference to human life, the merciless spirit of desolation which took no note of man. The sense of his utter loneliness, now that even Défago had gone, came close as he looked about him and listened for the sound of his companion's returning footsteps.  There was pleasure in the sensation, yet with it a perfectly comprehensible alarm. And instinctively the thought stirred in him: \"What should I--_could_ I, do--if anything happened and he did not come back--?\"  They enjoyed their well-earned supper, eating untold quantities of fish, and drinking unmilked tea strong enough to kill men who had not covered thirty miles of hard \"going,\" eating little on the way. And when it was over, they smoked and told stories round the blazing fire, laughing, stretching weary limbs, and discussing plans for the morrow. Défago was in excellent spirits, though disappointed at having no signs of moose to report. But it was dark and he had not gone far. The _brulé_, too, was bad. His clothes and hands were smeared with charcoal. Simpson, watching him, realized with renewed vividness their position--alone together in the wilderness.  \"Défago,\" he said presently, \"these woods, you know, are a bit too big to feel quite at home in--to feel comfortable in, I mean!... Eh?\" He merely gave expression to the mood of the moment; he was hardly prepared for the earnestness, the solemnity even, with which the guide took him up.  \"You've hit it right, Simpson, boss,\" he replied, fixing his searching brown eyes on his face, \"and that's the truth, sure. There's no end to 'em--no end at all.\" Then he added in a lowered tone as if to himself, \"There's lots found out _that_, and gone plumb to pieces!\"  But the man's gravity of manner was not quite to the other's liking; it was a little too suggestive for this scenery and setting; he was sorry he had broached the subject. He remembered suddenly how his uncle had told him that men were sometimes stricken with a strange fever of the wilderness, when the seduction of the uninhabited wastes caught them so fiercely that they went forth, half fascinated, half deluded, to their death. And he had a shrewd idea that his companion held something in sympathy with that queer type. He led the conversation on to other topics, on to Hank and the doctor, for instance, and the natural rivalry as to who should get the first sight of moose.  \"If they went doo west,\" observed Défago carelessly, \"there's sixty miles between us now--with ole Punk at halfway house eatin' himself full to bustin' with fish and coffee.\" They laughed together over the picture. But the casual mention of those sixty miles again made Simpson realize the prodigious scale of this land where they hunted; sixty miles was a mere step; two hundred little more than a step. Stories of lost hunters rose persistently before his memory. The passion and mystery of homeless and wandering men, seduced by the beauty of great forests, swept his soul in a way too vivid to be quite pleasant. He wondered vaguely whether it was the mood of his companion that invited the unwelcome suggestion with such persistence.  \"Sing us a song, Défago, if you're not too tired,\" he asked; \"one of those old _voyageur_ songs you sang the other night.\" He handed his tobacco pouch to the guide and then filled his own pipe, while the Canadian, nothing loth, sent his light voice across the lake in one of those plaintive, almost melancholy chanties with which lumbermen and trappers lessen the burden of their labor. There was an appealing and romantic flavor about it, something that recalled the atmosphere of the old pioneer days when Indians and wilderness were leagued together, battles frequent, and the Old Country farther off than it is today. The sound traveled pleasantly over the water, but the forest at their backs seemed to swallow it down with a single gulp that permitted neither echo nor resonance.  It was in the middle of the third verse that Simpson noticed something unusual--something that brought his thoughts back with a rush from faraway scenes. A curious change had come into the man's voice. Even before he knew what it was, uneasiness caught him, and looking up quickly, he saw that Défago, though still singing, was peering about him into the Bush, as though he heard or saw something. His voice grew fainter--dropped to a hush--then ceased altogether. The same instant, with a movement amazingly alert, he started to his feet and stood upright--_sniffing the air_. Like a dog scenting game, he drew the air into his nostrils in short, sharp breaths, turning quickly as he did so in all directions, and finally \"pointing\" down the lake shore, eastwards. It was a performance unpleasantly suggestive and at the same time singularly dramatic. Simpson's heart fluttered disagreeably as he watched it.  \"Lord, man! How you made me jump!\" he exclaimed, on his feet beside him the same instant, and peering over his shoulder into the sea of darkness. \"What's up? Are you frightened--?\"  Even before the question was out of his mouth he knew it was foolish, for any man with a pair of eyes in his head could see that the Canadian had turned white down to his very gills. Not even sunburn and the glare of the fire could hide that.  The student felt himself trembling a little, weakish in the knees. \"What's up?\" he repeated quickly. \"D'you smell moose? Or anything queer, anything--wrong?\" He lowered his voice instinctively.  The forest pressed round them with its encircling wall; the nearer tree stems gleamed like bronze in the firelight; beyond that--blackness, and, so far as he could tell, a silence of death. Just behind them a passing puff of wind lifted a single leaf, looked at it, then laid it softly down again without disturbing the rest of the covey. It seemed as if a million invisible causes had combined just to produce that single visible effect. _Other_ life pulsed about them--and was gone.  Défago turned abruptly; the livid hue of his face had turned to a dirty grey.  \"I never said I heered--or smelt--nuthin',\" he said slowly and emphatically, in an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10897"],["title","The Wendigo (#3)"],["body","altered voice that conveyed somehow a touch of defiance. \"I was only--takin' a look round--so to speak. It's always a mistake to be too previous with yer questions.\" Then he added suddenly with obvious effort, in his more natural voice, \"Have you got the matches, Boss Simpson?\" and proceeded to light the pipe he had half filled just before he began to sing.  Without speaking another word they sat down again by the fire. Défago changing his side so that he could face the direction the wind came from. For even a tenderfoot could tell that. Défago changed his position in order to hear and smell--all there was to be heard and smelt. And, since he now faced the lake with his back to the trees it was evidently nothing in the forest that had sent so strange and sudden a warning to his marvelously trained nerves.  \"Guess now I don't feel like singing any,\" he explained presently of his own accord. \"That song kinder brings back memories that's troublesome to me; I never oughter've begun it. It sets me on t' imagining things, see?\"  Clearly the man was still fighting with some profoundly moving emotion. He wished to excuse himself in the eyes of the other. But the explanation, in that it was only a part of the truth, was a lie, and he knew perfectly well that Simpson was not deceived by it. For nothing could explain away the livid terror that had dropped over his face while he stood there sniffing the air. And nothing--no amount of blazing fire, or chatting on ordinary subjects--could make that camp exactly as it had been before. The shadow of an unknown horror, naked if unguessed, that had flashed for an instant in the face and gestures of the guide, had also communicated itself, vaguely and therefore more potently, to his companion. The guide's visible efforts to dissemble the truth only made things worse. Moreover, to add to the younger man's uneasiness, was the difficulty, nay, the impossibility he felt of asking questions, and also his complete ignorance as to the cause ...Indians, wild animals, forest fires--all these, he knew, were wholly out of the question. His imagination searched vigorously, but in vain....         *       *       *       *       *  Yet, somehow or other, after another long spell of smoking, talking and roasting themselves before the great fire, the shadow that had so suddenly invaded their peaceful camp began to shift. Perhaps Défago's efforts, or the return of his quiet and normal attitude accomplished this; perhaps Simpson himself had exaggerated the affair out of all proportion to the truth; or possibly the vigorous air of the wilderness brought its own powers of healing. Whatever the cause, the feeling of immediate horror seemed to have passed away as mysteriously as it had come, for nothing occurred to feed it. Simpson began to feel that he had permitted himself the unreasoning terror of a child. He put it down partly to a certain subconscious excitement that this wild and immense scenery generated in his blood, partly to the spell of solitude, and partly to overfatigue. That pallor in the guide's face was, of course, uncommonly hard to explain, yet it _might_ have been due in some way to an effect of firelight, or his own imagination ...He gave it the benefit of the doubt; he was Scotch.  When a somewhat unordinary emotion has disappeared, the mind always finds a dozen ways of explaining away its causes ...Simpson lit a last pipe and tried to laugh to himself. On getting home to Scotland it would make quite a good story. He did not realize that this laughter was a sign that terror still lurked in the recesses of his soul--that, in fact, it was merely one of the conventional signs by which a man, seriously alarmed, tries to persuade himself that he is _not_ so.  Défago, however, heard that low laughter and looked up with surprise on his face. The two men stood, side by side, kicking the embers about before going to bed. It was ten o'clock--a late hour for hunters to be still awake.  \"What's ticklin' yer?\" he asked in his ordinary tone, yet gravely.  \"I--I was thinking of our little toy woods at home, just at that moment,\" stammered Simpson, coming back to what really dominated his mind, and startled by the question, \"and comparing them to--to all this,\" and he swept his arm round to indicate the Bush.  A pause followed in which neither of them said anything.  \"All the same I wouldn't laugh about it, if I was you,\" Défago added, looking over Simpson's shoulder into the shadows. \"There's places in there nobody won't never see into--nobody knows what lives in there either.\"  \"Too big--too far off?\" The suggestion in the guide's manner was immense and horrible.  Défago nodded. The expression on his face was dark. He, too, felt uneasy. The younger man understood that in a _hinterland_ of this size there might well be depths of wood that would never in the life of the world be known or trodden. The thought was not exactly the sort he welcomed. In a loud voice, cheerfully, he suggested that it was time for bed. But the guide lingered, tinkering with the fire, arranging the stones needlessly, doing a dozen things that did not really need doing. Evidently there was something he wanted to say, yet found it difficult to \"get at.\"  \"Say, you, Boss Simpson,\" he began suddenly, as the last shower of sparks went up into the air, \"you don't--smell nothing, do you--nothing pertickler, I mean?\" The commonplace question, Simpson realized, veiled a dreadfully serious thought in his mind. A shiver ran down his back.  \"Nothing but burning wood,\" he replied firmly, kicking again at the embers. The sound of his own foot made him start.  \"And all the evenin' you ain't smelt--nothing?\" persisted the guide, peering at him through the gloom; \"nothing extrordiny, and different to anything else you ever smelt before?\"  \"No, no, man; nothing at all!\" he replied aggressively, half angrily.  Défago's face cleared. \"That's good!\" he exclaimed with evident relief. \"That's good to hear.\"  \"Have _you?_\" asked Simpson sharply, and the same instant regretted the question.  The Canadian came closer in the darkness. He shook his head. \"I guess not,\" he said, though without overwhelming conviction. \"It must've been just that song of mine that did it. It's the song they sing in lumber camps and godforsaken places like that, when they're skeered the Wendigo's somewhere around, doin' a bit of swift traveling.--\"  \"And what's the Wendigo, pray?\" Simpson asked quickly, irritated because again he could not prevent that sudden shiver of the nerves. He knew that he was close upon the man's terror and the cause of it. Yet a rushing passionate curiosity overcame his better judgment, and his fear.  Défago turned swiftly and looked at him as though he were suddenly about to shriek. His eyes shone, but his mouth was wide open. Yet all he said, or whispered rather, for his voice sank very low, was: \"It's nuthin'--nuthin' but what those lousy fellers believe when they've bin hittin' the bottle too long--a sort of great animal that lives up yonder,\" he jerked his head northwards, \"quick as lightning in its tracks, an' bigger'n anything else in the Bush, an' ain't supposed to be very good to look at--that's all!\"  \"A backwoods superstition--\" began Simpson, moving hastily toward the tent in order to shake off the hand of the guide that clutched his arm. \"Come, come, hurry up for God's sake, and get the lantern going! It's time we were in bed and asleep if we're going to be up with the sun tomorrow....\"  The guide was close on his heels. \"I'm coming,\" he answered out of the darkness, \"I'm coming.\" And after a slight delay he appeared with the lantern and hung it from a nail in the front pole of the tent. The shadows of a hundred trees shifted their places quickly as he did so, and when he stumbled over the rope, diving swiftly inside, the whole tent trembled as though a gust of wind struck it.  The two men lay down, without undressing, upon their beds of soft balsam boughs, cunningly arranged. Inside, all was warm and cozy, but outside the world of crowding trees pressed close about them, marshalling their million shadows, and smothering the little tent that stood there like a wee white shell facing the ocean of tremendous forest.  Between the two lonely figures within, however, there pressed another shadow that was _not_ a shadow from the night. It was the Shadow cast by the strange Fear, never wholly exorcised, that had leaped suddenly upon Défago in the middle of his singing. And Simpson, as he lay there, watching the darkness through the open flap of the tent, ready to plunge into the fragrant abyss of sleep, knew first that unique and profound stillness of a primeval forest when no wind stirs ... and when the night has weight and substance that enters into the soul to bind a veil about it.... Then sleep took him....     III   Thus, it seemed to him, at least. Yet it was true that the lap of the water, just beyond the tent door, still beat time with his lessening pulses when he realized that he was lying with his eyes open and that another sound had recently introduced itself with cunning softness between the splash and murmur of the little waves.  And, long before he understood what this sound was, it had stirred in him the centers of pity and alarm. He listened intently, though at first in vain, for the running blood beat all its drums too noisily in his ears. Did it come, he wondered, from the lake, or from the woods?...  Then, suddenly, with a rush and a flutter of the heart, he knew that it was close beside him in the tent; and, when he turned over for a better hearing, it focused itself unmistakably not two feet away. It was a sound of weeping; Défago upon his bed of branches was sobbing in the darkness as though his heart would break, the blankets evidently stuffed against his mouth to stifle it.  And his first feeling, before he could think or reflect, was the rush of a poignant and searching tenderness. This intimate, human"]]]
