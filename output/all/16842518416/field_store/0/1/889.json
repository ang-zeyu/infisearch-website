I am glad you are going with Father, though, for Miles has such a dreadful cold, poor boy.\"  \"His own fault,\" laughed Katherine.  \"If he will go and sit in a tub half the day, in the hope of shooting swans, he must expect to get a cold.\"  \"Boys will do unwise things, I fancy.  They can't help it, so it is of no use to blame them,\" Mrs. Burton said with a sigh.  Katherine laughed again.  Mrs. Burton had a way of never blaming anyone, and slipped through life always thinking the very best of the people with whom she came in contact, crediting them with good intentions however far short they might prove of good in reality. The sisters were alike in features and in their dainty, womanly ways, but in character they were a wide contrast.  Katherine, under her girlish softness and pretty winning manner, had hidden a firm will and purpose, a sound judgment, and a resourcefulness which would stand her in good stead in the emergencies of life.  She liked to decide things for herself, and choose what she would do; but Mrs. Burton always needed someone to lean upon and to settle momentous questions for her.  'Duke Radford was ready to start by the time dawn arrived, and Katherine was ready too.  It was so very cold that she had twisted a cloud of brilliant scarlet wool all over her head and ears, in addition to her other wrappings.  There were some stores to take to Fort Garry, and there would be others to bring back, as considerable trading was done between the fort and the settlement. Very often when 'Duke Radford ran out of some easy-to-sell commodity he was able to replenish his stock from the fort, while he in his turn accepted furs in barter from his customers, which he disposed of to the agent when next he visited the fort.  As on the journey to the second portage, 'Duke Radford went first, drawing a laden sledge, followed by Katherine, who looked after the dogs. There would be no riding either way to-day, and the daylight would be only just long enough for the work, the snow on the trail not being hard enough as yet to make the going very easy.  Fort Garry was reached without incident, although, to Katherine's secret dismay, her father had not spoken to her once, but had just gone moodily forward with his head hanging down, and dragging the sledge after him.  He roused up a little when the fort was reached, and talked to Peter M'Crawney, the agent, an eager-faced Scot with an insatiable desire for information on all sorts of subjects. Mrs. M'Crawney was an Irishwoman who was always sighing for the mild, moist climate and the peat reek of her childhood's home.  But Peter knew when he was well off, and meant to stick to his post until he had saved enough money to live without work.  \"Teaching school, are you?  Well it's myself that would like to be one of your scholars, for it's bonny you look with that scarlet thing wrapped round your head!\" exclaimed Mrs. M'Crawney in an admiring tone, when Katherine sat down to have a talk with her whilst 'Duke Radford did his business with the agent.  \"You can come if you like; we don't have any age limit at Roaring Water Portage,\" Katherine answered with a laugh.  She had to be bright and vivacious despite the heaviness of her heart, for it would never do to display her secret uneasiness on her father's account, or to betray his changed condition to strangers.  \"And pretty I should look at my age, sitting among the babies learning to do strokes and pothooks,\" the Irishwoman said, echoing the laugh.  Then she began to question Katherine eagerly concerning the news which had filtered through into the solitudes from the great world outside.  \"They are saying that the Mr. Selincourt who has bought the fishing fleet will come here when the waters open; but wherever will he stay?\"  \"I don't know; perhaps he will have one of the huts down at Seal Cove, although they are very dirty.  I think if I were in his place I should have a new hut built, or else live in a tent,\" Katherine answered.  \"He will have a hut built, I expect; then perhaps if he likes the place he will come every year.  Although it's funny the whims rich people have, to be coming to a place like this, when they might be living in a civilized country, with everything that heart could desire within a hand's reach,\" said Mrs. M'Crawney with a toss of her head.  \"I suppose being able to have all they want spoils them so much that they are always wanting a change.  But if we don't start we shall be late in getting home, and travelling is very bad over the broken ground at the end of the bay,\" Katherine said, as she rose and began to draw her scarlet cloud closer round her head again.  Her father was still talking to Peter M'Crawney when she came in search of him, but he looked so much relieved at the interruption that she could only suppose the agent had been talking overmuch about the rich Englishman who was expected in that remote quarter of the world next spring, when the waters were open.  \"Are you ready to go now?\" Katherine asked, a sudden pang of pity stabbing at her heart, for in the strong light her father's face looked worn and furrowed, more than she had ever seen it before; indeed, a look of age had crept over his countenance during the last few days that was very marked, while his dark hair showed streaks of grey which had certainly not been there a week ago.  He had momentarily taken off his cap, to do something to one of the lappets which was not comfortable; but now he put it on again, covering his head, ears, and a good part of his face as well.  \"Yes, I am ready, and rather keen on starting, for there is a damp smell coming in the air which may mean a slight thaw or more fall, and either would be bad for us to-day,\" he answered, lifting his head and sniffing, like a dog that scents a trail.  \"Can't the dogs pull you a piece, Miss?\" asked the agent in a tone of concern.  \"It is a shocking long way for a bit of a girl, even though she is on snowshoes.\"  \"It is not longer for me than for Father, and I don't even have to drag the sledge as he does,\" Katherine replied brightly, as she fitted her moccasined feet into the straps of her snowshoes.  The dogs were in a great hurry to start, and one, a great brown-and-white beast which always followed next the leader, kept flinging up its head and howling in the most dismal manner until they were well on their way.  The noise got on Katherine's nerves to such an extent that she was tempted to use her whip to the dog, and only refrained because it seemed so cruel to thrash a creature for just being miserable.  To cheer the animals for the heavy work before them, she talked to them as if they were human beings, encouraging them so much that they took the first ten miles at a tremendous rate, following so close on the track of the first sledge that presently 'Duke Radford held up his hand as a signal for stopping, then turned round to expostulate in a peevish tone: \"What do you mean by letting the dogs wear themselves out at such a rate?  We shall have one of them dropping exhausted presently, and then we shall be in a nice fix.\"  \"I haven't used the whip once, Father, but I thought it was better to get them on as fast as I could, for I have felt and seen ever so many snowflakes in the last half-hour,\" Katherine said penitently.  'Duke Radford turned his face rather anxiously windward, and was considerably worried to find that a few small snowflakes came dancing slowly down, and that the slight draught of the morning was changing to a raw, cold wind from off the water.  \"It is a fall coming, and by the look of it, it may be heavy.  You had better keep the dogs coming as fast as you can.  But stop if I throw up my hand, or you will be running me down.\"  \"Shall we change places for a time?\" asked Katherine.  \"I am not a bit tired, but you look just worn out.\"  \"No, no, I can't have you dragging a sledge.  But be careful and keep the dogs from rushing down the slopes and overrunning me,\" he answered, then started forward again.  The flakes were falling faster now, but they were so fine that they would have scarcely counted had it not been for the number of them. At the end of the next half-hour the fall was like a fog of whirling atoms, and the travellers looked like moving snow figures. The dogs were still running well, and Katherine found it hard work to keep them back, especially on the slopes, where they would persist in trying to make rushes, so getting thoroughly out of hand.  She was keeping them back down one long bad slope which abounded in pitfalls, when to her horror she heard her father cry out, then saw him and his sledge disappear, shooting into a whirling smother of snow.    [Illustration:  'Duke Radford meets with an accident]  With a sharp order to the dogs to stop, which they promptly obeyed by dropping in four panting heaps on the snow, she went forward alone to see what had happened to her father.  It was a simple enough accident, and one that had to be constantly guarded against in drawing a sledge when travelling on snowshoes.  In going down the slope the sledge had travelled proportionally faster than the man, and, catching against the framework of one of the snowshoes, had flung him with tremendous force between two trees. The trees, which were really two shoots from one root, grew so close together that when 'Duke Radford was pitched in between them he was wedged fast by the force of the impact, while the sledge, coming on behind, bounded on to his prostrate body.  He groaned when Katherine dragged the sledge away, and cried out with the pain when she tried to help him out.  \"Did it hurt you so badly?  Oh, I am sorry!  But I will be more careful next time,\" she said; and, stepping carefully backwards after that first vain attempt, she slipped her feet clear of the snowshoes and went closer to the tree, so that she might try to lift him out of the fork by sheer strength of arm.  But the snow was so soft that she sank in over her ankles, going"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11110"],["title","A Countess from Canada: A Story of Life in the Backwoods (#3)"],["body","and deeper with every attempt which she made to wriggle herself free.  \"This won't do,\" she said sharply. \"I won't be long, Father dear, but I must pack the snow a bit before I can get firm standing ground.\"  Slipping her father's snowshoes, one of which was broken, from his feet, she took the broken part and proceeded to beat the snow firm all round the trees.  This took perhaps ten minutes, although she worked so hard that she perspired despite the cold.  The snow was firm now; she could stand without sinking, and going round in front of her father she exerted all her strength and lifted him up a little.  He was bleeding from a wound on his face, and seemed to be quite dazed.  \"Can you help yourself at all?\" she asked urgently, knowing that it was quite impossible for her unaided strength to get him clear of the fork.  But his only reply was a groan, and Katherine began to grow frightened.  It was quite impossible to leave him while she went to summon aid, and equally impossible to get help without going for it.  Meanwhile the cold was so intense that every moment of waiting became a risk.  Even the dogs were whining and restless, impatient to get off again for the last stage of their journey.  \"Father, you must help yourself,\" the girl cried despairingly.  \"I can't possibly get you out of the tree alone, and you will just freeze to death if you are not quick.\"  The urgency of her tone seemed to rouse him a little, and, seeing that he appeared to be coming to himself again, she rubbed his face briskly with snow, which quickened his faculties, and incidentally made the wound on his cheek smart horribly; but that was a minor matter, the chief thing being to make him bestir himself.  Then by a great effort she lifted him up again, and this time he put out his hand and clutched at the trunk of the tree, and so kept himself from slipping back into the fork, while she ran round and pulled him clear of the trees, making him lean upon her whilst she debated on her next move.  \"I don't know how we shall get home; I can't walk,\" he said feebly.  \"Of course you can't; that is entirely out of the question,\" she said briskly.  \"I must unload the two sledges, and cache the things close to this tree, under your sledge; then the dogs can draw you home.  There is not much over three miles to be done, so we shall not be long.\"  She made him sit on the snow while she set about her preparations, for he seemed too weak to stand alone.  Most of the goods were taken from the dog sledge and piled in a heap at the foot of the forked trees.  The other sledge was brought alongside and unloaded also, then Katherine dragged the hand sledge on to the top of the packages, with the runners sticking upwards, so that a curious wolf might think it was a trap of a fresh shape, and avoid it accordingly.  All this took time, however, and when she had got her father packed into the sledge in readiness for a start it was almost dark, while the snow was coming down thicker than ever.  The brown-and-white dog was howling dismally again, while the black one which had a cropped ear seemed disposed to follow suit.  It was of no use trying to guide the dogs now, and, falling into the rear, Katherine shouted to them to go forward, and left it to their instinct to find the way home.  She had to keep shouting and singing to them the whole of the way.  If from very weariness her voice sank to silence, they dropped into a slow walk; but when it rang out again in a cheery shout, they plunged forward at a great pace, which was maintained only so long as she continued shouting. But at last, after what seemed an interminable time, she heard the noise of the water coming over Roaring Water Portage; the dogs heard it too, and the need for shouting ceased, for they knew they were almost at the end of the journey.     CHAPTER III  Outwitting the Enemy  Among his neighbours at Seal Cove, 'Duke Radford counted one very pronounced enemy, and that was Oily Dave, master of one of the sealing boats, and keeper of the only whisky saloon within twenty or thirty miles of Roaring Water Portage.  The cause of the enmity was now nearly two years old, but like a good many other things it had gained strength with age.  Oily Dave had been supplying the red man with liquor, and this in defiance of the law which forbade such sales; 'Duke Radford reported him, and Oily Dave was mulcted in a fine so heavy that it consumed all the profits from his Indian traffic, and a good many other and more legitimate profits also. Since then Oily Dave had hated the storekeeper with a zest and energy which bade fair to become the ruling passion of his life; but except for a few minor disagreeables, that could hardly be said to count, his ill will had thus far not gone beyond sneer and invective.  Katherine was always afraid of him, and of what he might do to her father if he had the chance; for his nature was small and mean, so small and so mean that, though he might not risk a reprisal which would bring him within the reach of the law, he would not hesitate at any small, mean act of spite which might injure his victim, yet would not reflect on himself.  Since knowing of her father's trouble, she had been more afraid of Oily Dave than ever, for there was a sinister look about the man, and she feared she knew not what.  When the dogs, with their master in the sledge, and Katherine following close behind, dashed up to the door of the store that evening, Oily Dave was the first person to step forward to lend a helping hand in getting 'Duke Radford housed and his hurts examined.  There were six or seven men loafing about the store that evening, and they all helped; so Katherine, when she had kicked off her snowshoes, was able to dart indoors to warn Mrs. Burton about what had happened.  \"He ought to be put to bed at once, Nellie.  Night school must go for to-night, and if he has to keep his bed to-morrow, why, I must teach in here, or even in the store,\" she said hurriedly, deciding everything on the spot as was her wont, because Mrs. Burton always found it so difficult to make up her mind on any subject.  \"Do you think that would be best, or shall we give him our bedroom?--though that would be frightfully inconvenient, and I should be so worried to be obliged to put the children to bed in that other room at night, so far away from us, after the store is closed,\" sighed Mrs. Burton, who stood still in the middle of the room, clasping and unclasping her hands in nervous distress, while Katherine dragged off her encumbering wraps, tossing them in a heap on the floor.  \"Come and help me to make the bed, Nellie,\" she said, turning away and leaving Mrs. Burton's plaintive questions unanswered.  The elder sister at once did as the younger requested, sighing a little as she went, yet relieved all the same because the matter had been settled for her.  By this time some of the men had brought 'Duke Radford into the store, and, sitting him on the bench by the stove, were peeling off his outer wraps.  Some of the others had unharnessed the dogs, while Phil carried out their supper.  Miles, meanwhile, was looking sharply after the store; for, although these neighbours were so kind and helpful, some of them were not to be trusted farther than they could be seen, and would have helped themselves to sugar, beans, tobacco, or anything else which took their fancy if the opportunity had been given them for doing so.  Whilst two of the men took 'Duke Radford's clothes off, and got him safely into bed, another man approached Miles and asked for a particular kind of tobacco.  The boy sought for it in the place where it was usually kept, but, failing to find it, turned to Katherine, who stood in impatient misery by the stove, waiting to go to her father when the men had done with him.  \"Katherine, where is the Black Crow tobacco kept now?  It always used to be on the shelf below the tea packets.\"  \"We are out of it,\" she replied.  \"But we shall have plenty to-morrow.  I had to cache most of the stores we were bringing; but they are safe enough, for I turned the little sledge upside down on the top of them, so I guess neither wolf nor wolverine will be able to get at them to tear the packets to pieces.\"  \"You won't be able to get them either, for with all this snow you will never be able to find them,\" said the man in a disappointed tone, for he was a great smoker who cared for only one sort of tobacco.  \"Oh! make your mind quite easy on that score,\" replied Katherine. \"I hung Father's broken snowshoe in a branch of the tree, to mark the place, and I shall go over quite early to-morrow to bring the goods home.\"  Directly she had spoken she repented her words; for she saw, without appearing to see, a look full of meaning which passed between Oily Dave and the customer who had been disappointed.  It was only a glance, and might stand for nothing, but she had seen it and was angry with herself for the indiscretion which had made her utter words which had better not have been spoken.  The men came out of the bedroom then, so she and Nellie were able to go in.  'Duke Radford was considerably battered.  He had a broken collar bone; one shoulder was bruised so badly that it looked as if it had been beaten with a hammer; and one side of his face had a deep flesh wound.  Mrs. Burton was a capital nurse: she and Katherine between them soon had the sufferer as comfortable as it was possible to make him; then they fed him with strong hot broth, after which Mrs. Burton remembered that Katherine had had no supper, and hustled her off to the other room in search of food. Katherine noticed as she went back through the store that Oily Dave had gone, also the man who had wanted to buy the Black Crow tobacco.  \"Miles, can you leave Phil to look after things, and come with me for five minutes?\" she said, with a thrill of anxiety in her tone. She was faint and spent with hunger and fatigue, the prospect before her seemed too dreadful to"]]]
