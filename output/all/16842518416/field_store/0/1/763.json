Oh, come off! You're a jolly lot of fellows, and you must have a fling sometimes.\"  \"We can be jolly without drinking or gambling.\"  \"Why, I'm hanged if you don't talk as if you considered it a crime to take a drink or have a little social game!\"  Frank felt his blood warm up a bit, but he held himself in hand, as he quietly retorted:  \"Intemperance is a crime. I presume there are men who take a drink, as you call it, without being intemperate; but I prefer to let the stuff alone entirely, and then there is no danger of going over the limit.\"  \"And I took you for a sport! That shows how a fellow can be fooled. But you do play poker occasionally. I know that.\"  \"How do you know it, Mr. Bloodgood?\"  \"By your language. You just spoke of going over the limit. That is a poker term.\"  \"And one used by many people who never played a game of cards in their lives.\"  \"But you have played cards? You have played poker? Can you deny it?\"  \"If I could, I wouldn't take the trouble, Mr. Bloodgood. I think you have made a mistake in sizing up this crowd.\"  \"Guess I have,\" sneered the fellow. \"You must be members of the Y.M.C.A.\"  \"Say, Frank!\" panted Jack; \"open the door and let me----\"  But Frank checked the hot-headed youth again.  \"Steady, Jack! It is not necessary. He will go directly. Mr. Bloodgood, you speak as if it were a disgrace to belong to the Y.M.C.A. That shows your ignorance and narrowness. The Y.M.C.A. is a splendid organization, and it has proved the anchor that has kept many a young man from dashing onto the rocks of destruction. Those who sneer at it should be ashamed of themselves, but, as a rule, they are too bigoted, prejudiced, or narrow-minded to recognize the fact that some of the most manly young men to be found belong to the Y.M.C.A.\"  Bloodgood laughed.  \"And I took you for a sport!\" he cried. \"By Jove! Never made such a blunder before in all my life! Studying for the ministry, I'll wager! Ha! ha! ha!\"  Frank saw that Diamond could not be held in check much longer.  \"One last word to you, Mr. Bloodgood,\" he spoke. \"I am not studying for the ministry, and I do not even belong to the Y.M.C.A. If I were doing the one or belonged to the other, I should not be ashamed of it. I don't like you. I can stand a little freshness; in fact, it rather pleases me; but you are altogether too fresh. You are offensive.\"  Merry flung open the door.  \"Good-day, sir.\"  Bloodgood stepped out, turned round, laughed, and then walked away.  \"Hang it, Merriwell!\" grated Diamond, as Frank closed the door; \"why didn't you let me kick him out onto his neck!\"     CHAPTER IV.  WHO IS BLOODGOOD?   Diamond was thoroughly angry. So was Rattleton. In his excitement, Harry said something that caused Frank to turn quickly, and observe:  \"Don't use that kind of language, old man, no matter what the provocation. Vulgarity is even lower than profanity.\"  Harry's face flushed, and he looked intensely ashamed of himself.  \"I peg your bardon--I mean I beg your pardon!\" he spluttered. \"It slipped out. You know I don't say anything like that often.\"  \"I know it,\" nodded Frank, \"and that's why it sounded all the worse. I don't know that I ever heard you use such a word before.\"  Harry did not resent Frank's reproof, for he knew Frank was right, and he was ashamed.  Every young man who stoops to vulgarity should be ashamed. Profanity is coarse and degrading; vulgarity is positively low and filthy. The youth who is careful to keep his clothes and his body clean should be careful to keep his mouth clean. Let nothing go into it or come out of it that is in any way lowering.  Did you ever hear a loafer on a corner using profane and obscene language? I'll warrant most of you have, and I'll warrant that you were thoroughly disgusted. You looked on the fellow as low, coarse, cheap, unfit to associate with respectable persons. The next time you use a word that you should be ashamed to have your mother or sister hear just think that you are following the example of that loafer. You are lowering yourself in the eyes of somebody, even though you may not think so at the time. Perhaps one of your companions may be a person who uses such language freely, and yet he has never before heard it from you. He laughs, he calls you a jolly good fellow to your face; but he thinks to himself that you are no better than anybody else, and behind your back he tells somebody what he thinks. He is glad of the opportunity to show that you are no better than he is. Never tell a vulgar story. Better never listen to one, unless your position is such that you cannot escape without making yourself appear a positive cad. If you have to listen to such a story, forget it as soon as possible. Above all things, do not try to remember it.  Some young men boast of the stories they know. And all their stories are of the \"shady\" sort. It is better to know no stories than to know that kind. It is better not to be called a good fellow than to win a reputation by always having a new story of the low sort ready on your tongue.  There are other and better ways of winning a reputation as a good fellow. There are stories which are genuinely humorous and funny which are also clean. No matter how much of a laugh he may raise, any self-respecting person feels that he has lowered himself by telling a vulgar story. It is not so if he has told a clean story. He is satisfied with the laughter he has caused and with himself.  Frank Merriwell was called a good fellow. It was not often that he told a story, but when he did, it was a good one, and it was clean. He had an inimitable way of telling anything, and his stories were all the more effective because they came at rare intervals. He did not cheapen them by making them common.  And never had anybody heard him tell a story that could prove offensive to the ears of a lady.  Not that he had not been tempted to do so. Not that he had not heard such stories. He had been placed in positions where he could not help hearing them without making himself appear like a thorough cad.  Frank's first attempt to tell a vulgar story had been the lesson that he needed. He was with a rather gay crowd of boys at the time, and several had told \"shady\" yarns, and then they had called for one from Frank. He started to tell one, working up to the point with all the skill of which he was capable. He had them breathless, ready to shout with laughter when the point was reached. He drew them on and on with all the skill of which he was capable. And then, just as the climax was reached, he suddenly realized just what he was about to say. A thought came to him that made his heart give a great jump.  \"What if my mother were listening?\"  That was the thought. His mother was dead, but her influence was over him. A second thought followed. Many times he had seemed to feel her hovering near. Perhaps she was listening! Perhaps she was hearing all that he was saying!  Frank Merriwell stopped and stood quite still. At first he was very pale, and then came a rush of blood to his face. He turned crimson with shame and hung his head.  His companions looked at him in astonishment. They could not understand what had happened. Some of them cried, \"Go on! go on!\"  After some seconds he tried to speak. At first he choked and could say nothing articulate. After a little, he muttered:  \"I can't go on--I can't finish the story! You'll have to excuse me, fellows! I'm not feeling well!\"  And he withdrew from the jolly party as soon as possible.  From that day Frank Merriwell never attempted to tell a story that was in the slightest degree vulgar. He had learned his lesson, and he never forgot it.  Some boys swagger, chew tobacco, talk vulgar, and swear because they do not wish to be called \"sissies.\" They fancy such actions and language make them manly, but nothing could be a greater mistake.  Frank did nothing of the sort, and all who knew him regarded him as thoroughly manly. Better to be called a \"sissy\" than to win reputed manliness at the cost of self-respect.  Frank had forced those who would have regarded him with scorn to respect him. He could play baseball or football with the best of them; he could run, jump, swim, ride, and he excelled by sheer determination in almost everything he undertook. He would not be beaten. If defeated once, he did not rest, but prepared himself for another trial and went in to win or die. In this way he showed himself manly, and he commanded the respect of enemies as well as friends.  Rattleton was ashamed of the language he had used after the departure of Bloodgood, and he did not attempt to excuse himself further. He lay back in his berth, looking sicker than ever.  \"I'd give ten dollars for the privilege of helping Mr. Bloodgood out with my foot!\" hissed Jack Diamond. \"Never saw anybody so fresh!\"  \"Oh, I've seen lots of people just like him,\" grunted Browning, getting out a pipe and lighting it.  \"Don't smoke, Bruce!\" groaned Rattleton, as the steamer gave an unusually heavy roll. \"I'm sick enough now. That will make me worse.\"  \"Oh, we'll open the port.\"  \"Open the port!\" laughed Frank. \"And we just told Bloodgood we did not drink.\"  \"Port-hole, not port wine,\" said the big fellow, with a yawn. \"We'll let in some fresh air.\"  \"We can't let in anything fresher than just went out,\" declared the Virginian, as he flung open the round window that served to admit light and air.  \"There's something mighty queer about that fellow,\" said Frank. \"Did you notice the diamonds he was wearing, fellows?\"  \"Yes,\" said Bruce, beginning to puff away at his new briarwood. \"Regular eye-hitters they were.\"  \"Who knows they were genuine?\" asked Jack.  \"Nobody here,\" admitted Frank. \"It is impossible to distinguish some fake stones from real diamonds, unless you examine them closely. But, somehow, I have a fancy that those were genuine diamonds.\"  \"What makes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10904"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Nobility; Or, The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp (#3)"],["body","think so?\"  \"I don't know just why I think so, but I do. Something tells me that for all of his swagger Bloodgood is a fellow who would scorn to wear paste diamonds.\"  \"What do you make out of the fellow, anyway?\" asked Bruce.  \"I'm not able to size him up yet,\" admitted Frank. \"I'm not certain whether he came of a good family or a bad one, but I'm inclined to fancy it was the former.\"  \"I'd like to know why you think so?\" from Jack. \"He did not show very good breeding.\"  \"But there is a certain something about his face that makes me believe he comes from a high-grade family. I think he has become lowered by associating with bad companions.\"  \"Well, I don't care who or what he is,\" declared Jack; \"if he gets fresh around me again, I'll crack him one for luck. I can't stand him for a cent!\"  \"Better turn him over to me,\" murmured Bruce, dozily. \"I'll sit on him.\"  \"And he'll think he's under an elephant,\" laughed Merry. \"Bruce cooked M. Montfort, and I reckon he'd have less trouble to cook Mr. Bloodgood.\"  At this moment there was a hesitating, uncertain knock on the door.  \"Another visitor, I wonder?\" muttered Frank.     CHAPTER V.  THE SUPERSTITIOUS MAN.   A little man hesitated outside the door when it was opened. He had a sad, uncertain, mournful drab face, puckered into a peculiar expression about the mouth. He was dressed in black, but his clothes were not a very good fit or in the latest style. He fingered his hat nervously. His voice was faltering when he spoke.  \"I--I beg your pardon, gentlemen. I--I hope I am not--intruding?\"  He had not crossed the threshold. He seemed in doubt about the advisability of venturing in.  There was something amusing in the appearance of the little man. Frank recognized a \"character\" in him, and Merry was interested immediately. He invited the little man in, and closed the door when that person had entered.  \"I--I know it's rather--rather--er--bold of me,\" said the stranger, apologetically. \"But you know people on shipboard--er--take many--liberties.\"  \"Oh, yes, we know it!\" muttered Diamond.  Browning grunted and looked the little man over. He was a curiosity to Bruce.  \"What can we do for you, sir?\" asked Frank.  The little man hesitated and looked around. He sidled over and put his hand on the partition.  \"The--ah--next room is occupied by the--er--the French gentleman, is it not?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I--I presume--presume, you know--that you are able to hear any--ah--conversation that may take place in that room, unless--er--the conversation is--guarded.\"  \"Not unless we take particular pains to listen,\" said Merry. \"Even then, it is doubtful if we can hear anything plainly.\"  \"And we are not eavesdroppers,\" cut in Diamond. \"We do not take pains to listen.\"  \"Oh, no--er--no, of course not!\" exclaimed the singular stranger. \"I--I didn't insinuate such a thing! Ha! ha! ha! The idea! But you know--sometimes--occasionally--persons hear things when they--er--do not try to hear.\"  \"Well, what in the world are you driving at?\" asked Frank, not a little puzzled by the man's singular manner.  \"Well, you see, it's--this way: I--I don't care to be--overheard. I don't want anybody to--to think I'm prying into their--private business. You understand?\"  \"I can't say that I do.\"  \"Perhaps I can make myself--er--clearer.\"  \"Perhaps you can.\"  \"My name is--er--Slush--Peddington Slush.\"  \"Holy cats! what a name!\" muttered Browning, while Rattleton grinned despite his sickness.  \"I--I'm taking a sea voyage--for--for my health,\" explained Mr. Slush. \"That's why I didn't go over on a--a regular liner. This way I shall be longer at--at sea. See?\"  \"And you are keeping us at sea by your lingering way in coming to a point,\" smiled Merry.  \"Eh?\" said the little man. Then he seemed to comprehend, and he broke into a sudden cackle of laughter, which he shut off with startling suddenness, looking frightened.  \"Beg your pardon!\" he exclaimed. \"Quite--ah--rude of me. I don't do it--often.\"  \"You look as if it wouldn't hurt you to do it oftener,\" said Merry, frankly. \"Laughter never hurt anyone.\"  \"I--I can't quite agree with--you, sir. I beg your pardon! No offense! I--I don't wish to be offensive--you understand. I once knew a man who died from--er--laughing. It is a fact, sir. He laughed so long--and so hard---that he--he lost his breath--entirely. Never got it back again. Since then I've been very--cautious. It's a bad sign to laugh--too hard.\"  Merry felt like shouting, but Jack was looking puzzled and dazed. Diamond could not comprehend the little man, and he failed to catch the humor of the character.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Slush, \"I will come directly to the--point.\"  \"Do,\" nodded Frank.  \"I just saw a--er--person leave this room. I wish to know if--Good gracious, sir! Do you know that is a bad sign!\"  He pointed a wavering finger at Frank.  \"What is a bad sign?\" asked Merry, surprised.  \"To wear a--a dagger pin thrust through a--a tie in which there is the least bit of--red. It is a sign of--of bloodshed. I--I beg you to remove that--that pin from that scarf!\"  The little man seemed greatly agitated.  After a moment of hesitation, Frank laughed lightly and took the pin from the scarf.  Immediately the visitor seemed to breathe more freely.  \"Ah--er--thank you!\" he said. \"I--I've seen omens enough. Everything seems to point to--to a--tragedy. I regret exceedingly that I ever sailed--on this steamer. I--I shall be thankful when I put my feet on dry land--if I ever do again.\"  \"You must be rather superstitious,\" suggested Frank.  \"Not at all--that is, not to any extent,\" Mr. Slush hastened to aver. \"There are a few signs--and omens--which I know--will come true.\"  \"Indeed!\"  \"Yes, sir!\" asserted the little man, with surprising positiveness. \"I know something will happen--to this boat. I--I am positive of it.\"  \"Why are you so positive?\"  \"Everything foretells it. At the very start it was--foretold. I was foolish then that I did not demand--demand, sir--to be set ashore, even after the steamer had left--her pier.\"  \"How was that?\"  \"There was a cat, sir--a poor, stray cat--that came aboard this steamer. They did not let her stay--understand me? They--they drove her off!\"  \"And that was a bad omen?\"  \"Bad! It was--ah--er--frightful! Old sailors will tell you that. Always--er--let a cat remain on board a vessel--if--she--comes on board. If you--if you do not--you will regret it.\"  \"And you think something must happen to this steamer?\"  \"I'm afraid so--I feel it. There is--something mysterious about the vessel, gentlemen. I don't know--just what it is--but it's something. The--the captain looks worried. I--I've noticed it. I've talked with him. Couldn't get any satisfaction--out of him. But I--I know!\"  \"I'm afraid you are a croaker,\" said Diamond, unable to keep still longer.  \"You may think so--now; but wait and see--wait. Keep your eyes--open. I--I think you will see something. I think you will find there are--mysterious things going on.\"  \"Well, you have not told us what you want of us, Mr. Slush,\" said Frank.  \"That's so--forgot it.\" Then, of a sudden, to Bruce: \"Don't twirl your thumbs--that way. Do it backward--backward! It--it's a sure sign of--disaster to twirl your thumbs--forward.\"  \"All right,\" grunted the big fellow; \"backward it is.\" And he reversed the motion.  \"Thank you,\" breathed Mr. Slush, with a show of relief. \"Now, I'll tell you--why I called. I--er--saw a young man--leaving this room--a few minutes ago.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Mr. Bloodgood.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I--I have taken an interest in--Mr. Bloodgood. I--I think he is--a rather nice young man.\"  \"I don't admire your taste,\" came from Jack.  \"Eh? I don't know him--very well. You understand. Met him--in the smoking-room. Sometimes I--er--play cards--for amusement. Met him that way.\"  \"Does he play for amusement?\" asked Frank.  \"Oh, yes--ah--of course. That is--he--he likes--a little stake.\"  \"I thought so.\"  \"I--I don't mind that.\"  \"Great Scott!\" thought Merry. \"I don't see how he ever gets round to play cards for money. I shouldn't think he'd know what to do. It would take him so long to make up his mind.\"  \"But I--I don't care to make a--a companion of anybody about whom I know--nothing. That's why I--came to you. I--I thought it might be you could give me--some information--about Mr. Bloodgood.\"  \"You've come to the wrong place.\"  \"Really? Don't you know--anything about him? You are--er--well acquainted with him?\"  \"On the contrary, to-day is the first time we have ever spoken to him.\"  \"Is that so?\" said Mr. Slush, in evident disappointment. \"You are--er--young men about--about his age, and--and--\"  \"Not in his class,\" put in Diamond.  \"No?\" said Mr. Slush, looking at Jack queerly. \"I didn't know--I thought--\"  There the queer little man stopped, seeming quite unable to proceed. Then, in his hesitating, uncertain way, he tried to make it clear that he did not care to play cards for money with anybody about whom he knew nothing. He was not very effective in his explanation, and seemed himself rather uncertain concerning his real reason for wishing to make inquiries concerning Bloodgood.  Frank studied Mr. Slush closely, but could not take the measure of the man. Somehow, Merry seemed to feel that there was more to the queer little fellow than appeared on the surface.  \"Well, you have come to the wrong parties to get information about Mr. Bloodgood,\" said Frank. \"But, if you are so particular about your company, it might be well to learn something concerning the other members of your party.\"  \"Oh--er--I know all about them,\" asserted Mr. Slush.  \"Indeed?\"  \"Yes. Hugh Hazleton is the younger son of an English nobleman, and he is--is all--right.\"  \"Who told you this?\"  \"He did.\"  \"Then it must be true,\" grunted Browning, with a grin on his broad face.  \"Yes,\" nodded the little man, innocently, \"that is--ah--settled. M. Rouen Montfort is a--a great French journalist and--er--writer of books.\"  \"Is that so?\" smiled Merry. \"Queer, I never"]]]
