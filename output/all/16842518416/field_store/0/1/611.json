I lie awake nights thinking of the bad end you're likely to come to unless you change your ways.\"  Jack shrugged his shoulders, but the captain came to his help.  \"Boys will be boys, ma'am,\" he said. \"I was up to no end of tricks myself when I was a boy.\"  \"You weren't so bad as Jack, I know,\" said Rachel.  \"Thank you for standing up for me, ma'am; but I'm afraid I was. I don't think Jack's so very bad, for my part.\"  \"I didn't play the tricks Aunt Rachel mentioned,\" said Jack. \"It was another boy in our block.\"  \"You're all alike,\" said Rachel. \"I don't know what you boys are all coming to.\"  Presently the captain announced that he must go. Jack accompanied him as far as the pier, but the rest of the family remained behind. Aunt Rachel became gloomier than ever.  \"I don't know what you'll do, now you've lost your boarder,\" she said.  \"He will be a loss to us, it is true,\" said Mrs. Harding; but we are fortunate in having had him with us so long.\"  \"It's only puttin' off our misery a little longer,\" said Rachel. \"We've got to go to the poorhouse, after all.\"  Rachel was in one of her moods, and there was no use in arguing with her, as it would only have intensified her gloom.  Meanwhile Jack was bidding good-by to the captain.  \"I'm sorry you can't go with me, Jack,\" said the bluff sailor.  \"So am I; but I can't leave mother.\"  \"Right, my lad; I wouldn't take you away from her. But there--take that, and don't forget me.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said Jack, as the captain pressed into his hand a five-dollar gold piece. \"May I give it to my mother?\"  \"Certainly, my lad; you can't do better.\"  Jack stood on the wharf till the vessel was drawn out into the stream by a steam tug. Then he went home.     CHAPTER VI  THE LANDLORD'S VISIT   It was the night before the New Year. In many a household in the great city it was a night of happy anticipation. In the humble home of the Hardings it was an evening of anxious thought, for to-morrow the quarter's rent was due.  \"I haven't got a dollar to meet the rent, Martha,\" said the cooper, in a depressed tone.  \"Won't Mr. Colman wait?\"  \"I'm afraid not. You know what sort of a man he is, Martha. There isn't much feeling about him. He cares more for money than anything else.\"  \"Perhaps you are doing him an injustice.\"  \"I am afraid not. Did you never hear how he treated the Underhills?\"  \"How?\"  \"Underhill was laid up with rheumatic fever for three months. The consequence was that when quarter day came round he was in about the same situation with ourselves--a little worse, even, for his wife was sick also. But, though Colman was aware of the circumstances, he had no pity; he turned them out without ceremony.\"  \"Is it possible?\" asked Mrs. Harding, uneasily.  \"And there's no reason for his being more lenient with us. I can't but feel anxious about to-morrow, Martha.\"  At this moment, verifying an old adage, which will perhaps occur to the reader, who should knock but Mr. Colman himself. Both the cooper and his wife had an instinctive foreboding as to his visit.  He came in, rubbing his hands in a social way, as was his custom. No one, to look at him, would have suspected the hardness of heart that lay veiled under his velvety softness of manner.  \"Good-evening, Mr. Harding,\" he said, affably. \"I trust you and your excellent wife are in good health.\"  \"That blessing, at least, is continued to us,\" said the cooper, gravely.  \"And how comfortable you're looking, too, eh! It makes an old bachelor like me feel lonesome when he contrasts his own solitary room with such a scene of comfort as this. You've got a comfortable home, and dog cheap, too. All my other tenants are grumbling to think you don't have to pay any more for such superior accommodations. I've about made up my mind that I must ask you twenty-five dollars a quarter hereafter.\"  All this was said very pleasantly, but the pill was none the less bitter.  \"It seems to me, Mr. Colman,\" answered the cooper, soberly, \"you have chosen rather a singular time for raising the rent.\"  \"Why singular, my good sir?\" inquired the landlord, urbanely.  \"You know, of course, that this is a time of general business depression; my own trade in particular has suffered greatly. For a month past I have not been able to find any work.\"  Colman's face lost something of its graciousness.  \"And I fear I shall not be able to pay my quarter's rent to-morrow.\"  \"Indeed!\" said the landlord, coldly. \"Perhaps you can make it up within two or three dollars.\"  \"I can't pay a dollar toward it,\" said the cooper. \"It's the first time, in the five years I've lived here, that this thing has happened to me. I've always been prompt before.\"  \"You should have economized as you found times growing harder,\" said Colman, harshly. \"It is hardly honest to live in a house when you know you can't pay the rent.\"  \"You shan't lose it, Mr. Colman,\" said the cooper, earnestly. \"No one ever yet lost anything by me, and I don't mean anyone shall, if I can help it. Only give me a little time, and I will pay all.\"  The landlord shook his head.  \"You ought to have cut your coat according to your cloth,\" he responded. \"Much as it will go against my feelings I am compelled, by a prudent regard to my own interests, to warn you that, in case your rent is not ready to-morrow, I shall be obliged to trouble you to find another tenement; and furthermore, the rent of this will be raised five dollars a quarter.\"  \"I can't pay it, Mr. Colman,\" said Timothy Harding, gravely. \"I may as well say that now; and it's no use agreeing to pay more rent. I pay all I can afford now.\"  \"Very well, you know the alternative. Of course, if you can do better elsewhere, you will. That's understood. But it's a disagreeable subject. We won't talk of it any more now. I shall be round to-morrow forenoon. How's your excellent sister--as cheerful as ever?\"  \"Quite as much so as usual,\" answered the cooper, dryly.  \"There's one favor I should like to ask,\" he said, after a pause. \"Will you allow us to remain here a few days till I can look about a little?\"  \"I would with the greatest pleasure in the world,\" was the reply; \"but there's another family very anxious to take the house, and they wish to come in immediately. Therefore I shall be obliged to ask you to move out to-morrow. In fact, that is the very thing I came here this evening to speak about, as I thought you might not wish to pay the increased rent.\"  \"We are much obliged to you,\" said the cooper, with a tinge of bitterness unusual to him. \"If we are to be turned into the street, it is pleasant to have a few hours' notice of it.\"  \"Turned out of doors, my good sir! What disagreeable expressions you employ! If you reflect for a moment, you will see that it is merely a matter of business. I have an article to dispose of. There are two bidders, yourself and another person. The latter is willing to pay a larger sum. Of course I give him the preference, as you would do under similar circumstances. Don't you see how it is?\"  \"I believe I do,\" replied the cooper. \"Of course it's a regular proceeding; but you must excuse me if I think of it in another light, when I reflect that to-morrow at this time my family may be without a shelter.\"  \"My dear sir, positively you are looking on the dark side of things. It is actually sinful for you to distrust Providence as you seem to do. You're a little disappointed, that's all. Just take to-night to sleep on it, and I've no doubt you'll see things in quite a different light. But positively\"--here he rose, and began to draw on his gloves--\"positively I have stayed longer than I intended. Good-night, my friends. I'll look in upon you in the morning. And, by the way, as it's so near, permit me to wish you a happy New Year.\"  The door closed upon the landlord, leaving behind two anxious hearts.  \"It looks well in him to wish that,\" said the cooper, gloomily. \"A great deal he is doing to make it so. I don't know how it seems to others; for my part, I never say them words to anyone, unless I really wish 'em well, and am willing to do something to make 'em so. I should feel as if I was a hypocrite if I acted anyways different.\"  Martha was not one who was readily inclined to think evil of anyone, but in her own gentle heart she could not help feeling a repugnance for the man who had just left them. Jack was not so reticent.  \"I hate that man,\" he said, decidedly.  \"You should not hate anyone, my son,\" said Mrs. Harding.  \"I can't help it, mother. Ain't he goin' to turn us out of the house to-morrow?\"  \"If we cannot pay our rent, he is justified in doing so.\"  \"Then why need he pretend to be so friendly? He don't care anything for us.\"  \"It is right to be polite, Jack.\"  \"I s'pose if you're goin' to kick a man, it should be done politely,\" said Jack, indignantly.  \"If possible,\" said the cooper, laughing.  \"Is there any tenement vacant in this neighborhood?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  \"Yes, there is one in the next block belonging to Mr. Harrison.\"  \"It is a better one than this.\"  \"Yes; but Harrison only asks the same rent that we have been paying. He is not so exorbitant as Colman.\"  \"Couldn't we get that?\"  \"I am afraid if he knows that we have failed to pay our rent here, that he will object.\"  \"But he knows you are honest, and that nothing but the hard times would have brought you to this pass.\"  \"It may be, Martha. At any rate, you have lightened my heart a little. I feel as if there was some hope left, after all.\"  \"We ought always to feel so, Timothy. There was one thing that Mr. Colman said that didn't sound so well, coming from his lips; but it's true for all that.\"  \"What do you refer to?\"  \"I mean that about not distrusting Providence. Many a time have I been comforted by reading the verse: 'Never have I seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.' As long as we try to do what is right, Timothy, God will not suffer us to want.\"  \"You are right, Martha. He is our ever-present help in time of trouble. When I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10729"],["title","Jack's Ward; Or, The Boy Guardian (#5)"],["body","of that, I feel easier.\"  They retired to rest thoughtfully but not sadly.  The fire upon the hearth flickered and died out at length. The last sands of the old year were running out, and the new morning ushered in its successor.     CHAPTER VII  THE NEW YEAR'S GIFT   \"Happy New Year!\" was Jack's salutation to Aunt Rachel, as with an unhappy expression of countenance she entered the sitting room.  \"Happy, indeed!\" she repeated, dismally. \"There's great chance of its being so, I should think. We don't any of us know what the year may bring forth. We may all be dead and buried before the next new year.\"  \"If that's the case,\" said Jack, \"let us be jolly as long as life lasts.\"  \"I don't know what you mean by such a vulgar word,\" said Aunt Rachel, disdainfully. \"I've heard of drunkards and such kind of people being jolly; but, thank Providence, I haven't got to that yet.\"  \"If that was the only way to be jolly,\" said Jack, stoutly, \"then I'd be a drunkard; I wouldn't carry round such a long face as you do, Aunt Rachel, for any money.\"  \"It's enough to make all of us have long faces,\" said his aunt, sourly, \"when you are brazen enough to own that you mean to be a miserable drunkard.\"  \"I didn't say any such thing,\" said Jack, indignantly.  \"Perhaps I have ears,\" remarked Aunt Rachel, sententiously, \"and perhaps I have not. It's a new thing for a nephew to tell his aunt that she lies. They didn't use to allow such things when I was young. But the world's going to rack and ruin, and I shouldn't wonder if the people was right that say it's coming to an end.\"  Here Mrs. Harding happily interposed, by asking Jack to go round to the grocery in the next street, and buy a pint of milk for breakfast.  Jack took his hat and started with alacrity, glad to leave the dismal presence of Aunt Rachel.  He had scarcely opened the door when he started back in surprise, exclaiming: \"By hokey, if there isn't a basket on the steps!\"  \"A basket!\" repeated his mother, in surprise. \"Can it be a New Year's present? Bring it in, Jack.\"  It was brought in immediately, and the cover being lifted, there appeared a female child, apparently a year old.  All uttered exclamations of surprise, each in itself characteristic.  \"What a dear, innocent little thing!\" said Mrs. Harding, with true maternal instinct.  \"Ain't it a pretty un?\" exclaimed Jack, admiringly.  \"It looks as if it was goin' to have the measles,\" said Aunt Rachel, \"or scarlet fever. You'd better not take it in, Martha, or we may all catch it.\"  \"You wouldn't leave it out in the cold, would you, Rachel? The poor thing might die of exposure.\"  \"Probably it will die,\" said Rachel, mournfully. \"It's very hard to raise children. There's something unhealthy in its looks.\"  \"It don't seem to me so. It looks plump and healthy.\"  \"You can't never judge by appearances. You ought to know that, Martha.\"  \"I will take the risk, Rachel.\"  \"I don't see what you are going to do with a baby, when we are all on the verge of starvation, and going to be turned into the street this very day,\" remarked Rachel, despondently.  \"We won't think of that just now. Common humanity requires us to see what we can do for the poor child.\"  So saying, Mrs. Harding took the infant in her arms. The child opened its eyes, and smiled.  \"My! here's a letter,\" said Jack, diving into the bottom of the basket. \"It's directed to you, father.\"  The cooper opened the letter, and read as follows:  \"For reasons which it is unnecessary to state, the guardians of this child find it expedient to intrust it to others to bring up. The good account which they have heard of you has led them to select you for that charge. No further explanation is necessary, except that it is by no means their intention to make this a service of charity. They, therefore, inclose a certificate of deposit on the Broadway Bank of five hundred dollars, the same having been paid in to your credit. Each year, while the child remains in your charge, the same will in like manner be placed to your credit at the same bank. It may be as well to state, further, that all attempt to fathom whatever of mystery may attach to this affair will prove useless.\"  The letter was read in amazement. The certificate of deposit, which had fallen to the floor, was picked up by Jack, and handed to his father.  Amazement was followed by a feeling of gratitude and relief.  \"What could be more fortunate?\" exclaimed Mrs. Harding. \"Surely, Timothy, our faith has been rewarded.\"  \"God has listened to our cry!\" said the cooper, devoutly, \"and in the hour of our sorest need He has remembered us.\"  \"Isn't it prime?\" said Jack, gleefully; \"five hundred dollars! Ain't we rich, Aunt Rachel?\"  \"Like as not,\" observed Rachel, \"the certificate isn't genuine. It doesn't look natural it should be. I've heard of counterfeits afore now. I shouldn't be surprised at all if Timothy got took up for presenting it.\"  \"I'll take the risk,\" said her brother, who did not seem much alarmed at the suggestion.  \"Now you'll be able to pay the rent, Timothy,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully.  \"Yes, and it's the last quarter's rent I mean to pay Mr. Colman, if I can help it.\"  \"Why, where are you going?\" asked Jack.  \"To the house belonging to Mr. Harrison that I spoke of last night, that is, if it isn't already engaged. I think I will see about it at once. If Mr. Colman should come in while I am gone, tell him I will be back directly; I don't want you to tell him of the change in our circumstances.\"  The cooper found Mr. Harrison at home.  \"I called to inquire,\" asked Mr. Harding, \"whether you have let your house?\"  \"Not as yet,\" was the reply.  \"What rent do you ask?\"  \"Twenty dollars a quarter. I don't think that unreasonable.\"  \"It is satisfactory to me,\" was the cooper's reply, \"and if you have no objections to me as a tenant, I will engage it at once.\"  \"Far from having any objections, Mr. Harding,\" was the courteous reply, \"I shall be glad to secure so good a tenant. Will you go over and look at the house?\"  \"Not now, sir; I am somewhat in haste. Can we move in to-day?\"  \"Certainly.\"  His errand satisfactorily accomplished, the cooper returned home.  Meanwhile the landlord had called.  He was a little surprised to find that Mrs. Harding, instead of looking depressed, looked cheerful rather than otherwise.  \"I was not aware you had a child so young,\" he remarked, looking at the baby.  \"It is not mine,\" said Mrs. Harding, briefly.  \"The child of a neighbor, I suppose,\" thought the landlord.  Meanwhile he scrutinized closely, without appearing to do so, the furniture in the room.  At this point Mr. Harding entered the house.  \"Good-morning,\" said Colman, affably. \"A fine morning, Mr. Harding.\"  \"Quite so,\" responded his tenant, shortly.  \"I have called, Mr. Harding, to ask if you are ready with your quarter's rent.\"  \"I think I told you last evening how I was situated. Of course I am sorry.\"  \"So am I,\" interrupted the landlord, \"for I may be obliged to have recourse to unpleasant measures.\"  \"You mean that we must leave the house.\"  \"Of course you cannot expect to remain in it, if you are unable to pay the rent. I suppose,\" he added, making an inventory of the furniture with his eyes, \"you will leave behind a sufficient amount of furniture to cover your debt.\"  \"Surely you would not deprive us of our furniture!\"  \"Is there any injustice in requiring payment of honest debts?\"  \"There are cases of that description. However, I will not put you to the trouble of levying on my furniture. I am ready to pay your dues.\"  \"Have you the money?\" asked Colman, in surprise.  \"I have, and something over. Can you cash my check for five hundred dollars?\"  It would be difficult to picture the amazement of the landlord.  \"Surely you told me a different story last evening,\" he said.  \"Last evening and this morning are different times. Then I could not pay you. Now, luckily, I am able. If you will accompany me to the bank, I will draw some money and pay your bill.\"  \"My dear sir, I am not at all in haste for the money,\" said the landlord, with a return of his affability. \"Any time within a week will do. I hope, by the way, you will continue to occupy this house.\"  \"I don't feel like paying twenty-five dollars a quarter.\"  \"You shall have it for the same rent you have been paying.\"  \"But you said there was another family who had offered you an advanced rent. I shouldn't like to interfere with them. Besides, I have already hired a house of Mr. Harrison in the next block.\"  Mr. Colman was silenced. He regretted too late the hasty course which had lost him a good tenant. The family referred to had no existence; and, it may be remarked, the house remained vacant for several months, when he was glad to rent it at the old price.     CHAPTER VIII  A LUCKY RESCUE   The opportune arrival of the child inaugurated a season of comparative prosperity in the home of Timothy Harding. To persons accustomed to live in their frugal way, five hundred dollars seemed a fortune. Nor, as might have happened in some cases, did this unexpected windfall tempt the cooper or his wife to enter upon a more extravagant mode of living.  \"Let us save something against a rainy day,\" said Mrs. Harding.  \"We can if I get work soon,\" answered her husband. \"This little one will add but little to our expenses, and there is no reason why we shouldn't save up at least half of it.\"  \"So I think, Timothy. The child's food will not amount to a dollar a week.\"  \"There's no tellin' when you will get work, Timothy,\" said Rachel, in her usual cheerful way. \"It isn't well to crow before you are out of the woods.\"  \"Very true, Rachel. It isn't your failing to look too much at the sunny side of the picture.\"  \"I'm ready to look at it when I can see it anywhere,\" answered his sister, in the same enlivening way.  \"Don't you see it in the unexpected good fortune which came with this child?\" asked Timothy.  \"I've no doubt you think it very fortunate now,\" said Rachel, gloomily; \""]]]
