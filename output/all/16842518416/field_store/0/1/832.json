One day she shut the door of her house forever, and set out on a long journey. She had no hope of overtaking the Three Kings, but she longed to find the Child, that she too might love and worship Him. She asked every one she met, and some people thought her crazy, but others gave her kind answers. Have you perhaps guessed that the young Child whom the Three Kings sought was our Lord himself?  People told Babouscka how He was born in a manger, and many other things which you children have learned long ago. These answers puzzled the old dame mightily. She had but one idea in her ignorant head. The Three Kings had gone to seek a Baby. She would, if not too late, seek Him too.  She forgot, I am sure, how many long years had gone by. She looked in vain for the Christ-child in His manger-cradle. She spent all her little savings in toys and candy so as to make friends with little children, that they might not run away when she came hobbling into their nurseries.  Now you know for whom she is sadly seeking when she pushes back the bed-curtains and bends down over each baby's pillow. Sometimes, when the old grandmother sits nodding by the fire, and the bigger children sleep in their beds, old Babouscka comes hobbling into the room, and whispers softly, \"Is the young Child here?\"  Ah, no; she has come too late, too late. But the little children know her and love her. Two thousand years ago she lost the chance of finding Him. Crooked, wrinkled, old, sick and sorry, she yet lives on, looking into each baby's face--always disappointed, always seeking. Will she find Him at last?    THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT  SELMA LAGERLÃ–F   Far away, in a desert in the East, there grew, many years ago, a palm that was very, very old, and very, very tall. No one passing through the desert could help stopping to look at it, for it was much higher than other palms, and people said of it that it would surely grow to be higher than the Obelisks and Pyramids.  This great palm, standing in its loneliness, and looking over the desert, one day saw something which caused its huge crown of leaves to wave to and fro with surprise on its slender stem. On the outskirts of the desert two lonely persons were wandering. They were still so far away that even a camel would have looked no larger than an ant at that distance, but they were assuredly human beings, two who were strangers to the desert--for the palm knew the people of the desert--a man and a woman, who had neither guide, nor beasts of burden, nor tent, nor water-bag.  \"Verily,\" said the palm to itself, \"these two have come hither to die.\"  The palm looked quickly around.  \"I am surprised,\" it said, \"that the lions have not already gone out to seize their prey. But I do not see a single one about. Nor do I see any of the robbers of the desert. But they are sure to come.  \"There awaits them a sevenfold death,\" thought the palm. \"The lions will devour them, the serpents will sting them, thirst will consume them, the sand-storm will bury them, the robbers will kill them, the burning sun will overcome them, fear will destroy them.\"  The palm tried to think of something else; the fate of these two made it sad. But in the immeasurable desert around it there was not a single thing that the palm had not known and gazed at for thousands of years. Nothing could attract its attention. It was again obliged to think of the two wanderers.  \"By the drought and the wind!\" said the palm, invoking the two greatest enemies of life, \"what is the woman carrying on her arm? I believe these mad people have a little child with them!\"  The palm, which was long-sighted, as the aged generally are, saw aright. The woman carried in her arms a child, that had laid its head on her breast and was sleeping.  \"The child has not even enough clothes on,\" said the palm. \"I see that the mother has lifted up her skirt and thrown it over it. She has taken it out of its bed in great haste and hurried away with it. Now I understand: these people are fugitives.  \"But they are mad, all the same,\" continued the palm. \"If they have not an angel to protect them, they should rather have let their enemies do their worst than have taken refuge in the desert. I can imagine how it has all happened. The man is at work, the child sleeps in its cradle, the woman has gone to fetch water. When she has gone a few steps from the door she sees the enemy approaching. She rushes in, seizes the child, calls to the husband that he shall follow her, and runs away. Since then they have continued their flight the whole day; they have assuredly not rested a single moment. Yes, so it has all happened; but I say all the same, if no angel protects them--  \"They are in such fear that they do not feel either fatigue or other sufferings, but I read thirst in their eyes. I think I should know the face of a thirsty man.\"  And when the palm began to think about thirst a fit of trembling went through its high stem, and the innumerable fronds of its long leaves curled up as if held over a fire.  \"If I were a man,\" it said, \"I would never venture into the desert. He is truly brave who ventures here without having roots reaching down to the inexhaustible water-veins. There can be danger even for palms, even for such a palm as I. Could I advise them, I would beg them to return. Their enemies could never be as cruel to them as the desert. They think perhaps that it is easy to live in the desert. But I know that even I at times have had difficulty in keeping alive. I remember once in my youth when a whirlwind threw a whole mountain of sand over me I was nearly choking. If I _could_ die I should have died then.\"  The palm continued to think aloud, as lonely old people do.  \"I hear a wonderful melodious murmur passing through my crown,\" it said; \"all the fronds of my leaves must be moving. I do not know why the sight of these poor strangers moves me so. But this sorrowful woman is so beautiful! It reminds me of the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me.\"  And whilst its leaves continued their melodious rustle the palm remembered how once, long, long ago, a glorious human being had visited the oasis. It was the Queen of Sheba, accompanied by the wise King Solomon. The beautiful Queen was on her way back to her own country; the King had accompanied her part of the way, and now they were about to part. \"In memory of this moment,\" said the Queen, \"I now plant a date-kernel in the earth; and I ordain that from it shall grow a palm which shall live and grow until a King is born in Judaea greater than Solomon.\" And as she said this she placed the kernel in the ground, and her tears watered it.  \"How can it be that I should just happen to think of this to-day?\" said the palm. \"Can it be possible that this woman is so beautiful that she reminds me of the most beautiful of all queens, of her at whose bidding I have lived and grown to this very day? I hear my leaves rustling stronger and stronger,\" said the palm, \"and it sounds sorrowful, like a death-song. It is as if they prophesied that someone should soon pass away. It is well to know that it is not meant for me, inasmuch that I cannot die.\"  The palm thought that the death-song in its leaves must be for the two lonely wanderers. They themselves surely thought that their last hour was drawing near. One could read it in their faces when they walked past one of the skeletons of the camels that lay by the roadside. One saw it from the glances with which they watched a couple of vultures flying past. It could not be otherwise--they must perish.  They had now discovered the palm in the oasis, and hastened thither to find water. But when they at last reached it they sank down in despair, for the well was dried up. The woman, exhausted, laid down the child, and sat down crying by the side of the well. The man threw himself down by her side; he lay and beat the ground with his clenched hands. The palm heard them say to each other that they must die. It also understood from their conversation  that King Herod had caused all children of two or three years of age to be killed from fear that the great expected King in Judaea had been born.  \"It rustles stronger and stronger in my leaves,\" said the palm. \"These poor fugitives have soon come to their last moment.\"  It also heard that they were afraid of the desert. The man said it would have been better to remain and fight the soldiers than to flee. He said that it would have been an easier death.  \"God will surely help us,\" said the woman.  \"We are all alone amongst serpents and beasts of prey,\" said the man. \"We have no food and no water. How can God help us?\"  He tore his clothes in despair and pressed his face against the earth. He was hopeless, like a man with a mortal wound in his heart.  The woman sat upright, with her hands folded upon her knees. But the glances she cast over the desert spoke of unutterable despair.  The palm heard the sorrowful rustling in its leaves grow still stronger. The woman had evidently heard it too, for she looked up to the crown of the tree, and in the same moment she involuntarily raised her arms.  \"Dates, dates!\" she cried.  There was such a longing in her voice, that the old palm wished it had not been any higher than the gorse, and that its dates had been as easy to reach as the red berries of the hawthorn. It knew that its crown was full of clusters of dates, but how could man reach to such a dazzling height?  The man had already seen that, the dates being so high, it was impossible to reach them. He did not even lift his head. He told his wife that she must not wish for the impossible.  But the child, which had crawled about alone and was playing with sticks and straws, heard the mother's exclamation. The little one could probably not understand why his mother should not have everything she wished for. As soon as he heard the word \"dates,\" he began to look "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11014"],["title","Christmas in Legend and Story: A Book for Boys and Girls (#7)"],["body","the tree. He wondered and pondered how he should get the dates. There came almost wrinkles on his forehead under the fair locks. At last a smile passed over his face. Now he knew what he would do. He went to the palm, stroked it with his little hand, and said in his gentle, childish voice:  \"Bend down, palm. Bend down, palm.\"  But what was this, what could this be? The palm-leaves rustled, as if a hurricane rushed through them, and shudder upon shudder passed through the tall stem. And the palm felt that the little one was the stronger. It could not resist him.  And with its high stem it bowed down before the child, as men bow down before princes. In a mighty arch it lowered itself towards earth, and at last bowed so low that its great crown of trembling leaves swept the sand of the desert.  The child did not seem to be either frightened or surprised, but with a joyous exclamation it ran and plucked one cluster after another from the crown of the old palm.  When the child had gathered enough, and the tree was still lying on the earth, he again went to it, stroked it, and said in his gentlest voice:  \"Arise, palm, arise.\"  And the great tree raised itself silently and obediently on its stem, whilst the leaves played like harps.  \"Now I know for whom they play the death-song,\" the old palm said to itself, when it again stood erect. \"It is not for any of these strangers.\"  But the man and woman knelt down on their knees and praised God.  \"Thou hast seen our fear and taken it from us. Thou art the Mighty One, that bends the stem of the palm like a reed. Of whom should we be afraid when Thy strength protects us?\"  Next time a caravan passed through the desert, one of the travellers saw that the crown of the great palm had withered.  \"How can that have happened?\" said the traveller. \"Have we not heard that this palm should not die before it had seen a King greater than Solomon?\"  \"Perhaps it has seen Him,\" answered another wanderer of the desert.    THE HAUGHTY ASPEN  _A German Legend_  NORA ARCHIBALD SMITH   As I went through the tangled wood   I heard the Aspen shiver. \"What dost thou ail, sweet Aspen, say,   Why do thy leaflets quiver?\"  \"'Twas long ago,\" the Aspen sighed--   How long is past my knowing-- \"When Mary Mother rode adown   This wood where I was growing. Blest Joseph journey'd by her side,   Upon his good staff resting, And in her arms the Heav'nly Babe,   Dove of the World, was nesting. Fair was the mother, shining-fair,   A lily sweetly blowing; The Babe was but a lily-bud,   Like to his mother showing.  The birds began, 'Thy Master comes!   Bow down, bow down before Him!' The date, the fig, the hazel tree, In rev'rence bent to adore Him. I only, out of all the host   Of bird and tree and flower,-- I, haughty, would not bow my head,   Nor own my Master's power. 'Proud Aspen,' quoth the Mother-Maid,   'Thy Lord, dost thou defy Him? When emperors worship at His shrine,   Wilt courtesy deny Him?' I heard her voice; my heart was rent,   My boughs began to shiver, And age on age, in punishment,   My sorrowing leaflets quiver.\"  Still in the dark and tangled wood,   Still doth the Aspen quiver. The haughty tree doth bear a curse,   Her leaflets aye must shiver.    THE LITTLE MUD-SPARROWS  _Jewish Legend_  ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS   I like that old, kind legend   Not found in Holy Writ, And wish that John or Matthew   Had made Bible out of it.  But though it is not Gospel,   There is no law to hold The heart from growing better   That hears the story told:--  How the little Jewish children   Upon a summer day, Went down across the meadows   With the Child Christ to play.  And in the gold-green valley,   Where low the reed-grass lay,  They made them mock mud-sparrows   Out of the meadow clay.  So, when these all were fashioned,   And ranged in rows about, \"Now,\" said the little Jesus,   \"We'll let the birds fly out.\"  Then all the happy children   Did call, and coax, and cry-- Each to his own mud-sparrow:   \"Fly, as I bid you! Fly!\"  But earthen were the sparrows,   And earth they did remain, Though loud the Jewish children   Cried out, and cried again.  Except the one bird only   The little Lord Christ made; The earth that owned Him Master,   --His earth heard and obeyed.  Softly He leaned and whispered:   \"Fly up to Heaven! Fly!\" And swift, His little sparrow   Went soaring to the sky,  And silent, all the children   Stood, awestruck, looking on, Till, deep into the heavens,   The bird of earth had gone.  I like to think, for playmate   We have the Lord Christ still, And that still above our weakness   He works His mighty will,  That all our little playthings   Of earthen hopes and joys Shall be, by His commandment,   Changed into heavenly toys.  Our souls are like the sparrows   Imprisoned in the clay, Bless Him who came to give them wings   Upon a Christmas Day!    THE CHILDREN OF WIND AND THE CLAN OF PEACE  FIONA MACLEOD   I will tell this Legend as simply but also with what beauty I can, because the words of the old Highland woman, who told it to me,...though simple were beautiful with ancient idiom.  We must go back near twenty hundred years.... It was in the last month of the last year of the seven years' silence and peace: the seventh year in the mortal life of Jesus the Christ. It was on the twenty-fifth day of that month, the day of His holy birth.  It was a still day. The little white flowers that were called Breaths of Hope and that we now call Stars of Bethlehem were so hushed in quiet that the shadows of moths lay on them like the dark motionless violet in the hearts of pansies. In the long swards of tender grass the multitude of the daisies were white as milk faintly stained with flusht dews fallen from roses. On the meadows of white poppies were long shadows blue as the blue lagoons of the sky among drifting snow-white moors of cloud. Three white aspens on the pastures were in a still sleep: their tremulous leaves made no rustle, though there was a soundless wavering fall of little dusky shadows, as in the dark water of a pool where birches lean in the yellow hour of the frostfire. Upon the pastures were ewes and lambs sleeping, and yearling kids opened and closed their onyx eyes among the garths of white clover.  It was the Sabbath, and Jesus walked alone. When He came to a little rise in the grass He turned and looked back at the house where His parents dwelled. Joseph sat on a bench, with bent shoulders, and was dreaming with fixt gaze into the west, as seamen stare across the interminable wave at the pale green horizons that are like the grassy shores of home. Mary was standing, dressed in long white raiment, white as a lily, with her right hand shading her eyes as she looked to the east, dreaming her dream.  The young Christ sighed, but with the love of all love in His heart. \"So shall it be till the day of days,\" He said aloud; \"even so shall the hearts of men dwell among shadows and glories, in the West of passing things: even so shall that which is immortal turn to the East and watch for the coming of Joy through the Gates of Life.\"  At the sound of His voice He heard a sudden noise as of many birds, and turned and looked beyond the low upland where He stood. A pool of pure water lay in the hollow, fed by a ceaseless wellspring, and round it and over it circled birds whose breasts were grey as pearl and whose necks shone purple and grass-green and rose. The noise was of their wings, for though the birds were beautiful they were voiceless and dumb as flowers.  At the edge of the pool stood two figures, whom He knew to be of the angelic world because of their beauty, but who had on them the illusion of mortality so that the child did not know them. But He saw that one was beautiful as Night, and one beautiful as Morning.  He drew near.  \"I have lived seven years,\" He said, \"and I wish to send peace to the far ends of the world.\"  \"Tell your secret to the birds,\" said one.  \"Tell your secret to the birds,\" said the other.  So Jesus called to the birds.  \"Come,\" He cried; and they came.  Seven came flying from the left, from the side of the angel beautiful as Night. Seven came flying from the right, from the side of the angel beautiful as Morning.  To the first He said: \"Look into my heart.\"  But they wheeled about Him, and with newfound voices mocked, crying, \"How could we see into your heart that is hidden\" ... and mocked and derided, crying, \"What is Peace! ... Leave  us alone! Leave us alone!\"  So Christ said to them:  \"I know you for the birds of Ahriman, who is not beautiful but is Evil. Henceforth ye shall be black as night, and be children of the winds.\"  To the seven other birds which circled about Him, voiceless, and brushing their wings against His arms, He cried:  \"Look into my heart.\"  And they swerved and hung before Him in a maze of wings, and looked into His pure heart: and, as they looked, a soft murmurous sound came from them, drowsy-sweet, full of peace: and as they hung there like a breath in frost they became white as snow.  \"Ye are the Doves of the Spirit,\" said Christ, \"and to you I will commit that which ye have seen. Henceforth shall your plumage be white and your voices be the voices of peace.\"  The young Christ turned, for He heard Mary calling to the sheep and goats, and knew that dayset was come and that in the valleys the gloaming was already rising like smoke from the urns of the twilight. When He looked back He saw by the pool neither the Son of Joy nor the Son of Sorrow, but seven white doves were in the cedar beyond the pool, cooing in low ecstasy of peace and awaiting through sleep and dreams the rose-red pathways of the dawn. Down the long grey reaches of the ebbing day He saw seven birds rising and falling on the wind, black as black water in caves, black as the darkness of night in old pathless woods.  And that is how the first doves became white, and how the first crows became black and were called by a name that means the clan of darkness, the "]]]
