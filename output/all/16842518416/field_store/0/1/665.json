These,” he pointed around, “are my other guns. The parallel is       exact.”        Colonel Moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the       constables dragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible       to look at.        “I confess that you had one small surprise for me,” said Holmes.       “I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this       empty house and this convenient front window. I had imagined you       as operating from the street, where my friend, Lestrade and his       merry men were awaiting you. With that exception, all has gone as       I expected.”        Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.        “You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,” said he,       “but at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the       gibes of this person. If I am in the hands of the law, let things       be done in a legal way.”        “Well, that’s reasonable enough,” said Lestrade. “Nothing further       you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?”        Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was       examining its mechanism.        “An admirable and unique weapon,” said he, “noiseless and of       tremendous power: I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic,       who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty.       For years I have been aware of its existence though I have never       before had the opportunity of handling it. I commend it very       specially to your attention, Lestrade and also the bullets which       fit it.”        “You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade,       as the whole party moved towards the door. “Anything further to       say?”        “Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?”        “What charge, sir? Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr.       Sherlock Holmes.”        “Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at       all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the       remarkable arrest which you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I       congratulate you! With your usual happy mixture of cunning and       audacity, you have got him.”        “Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?”        “The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain—Colonel       Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an       expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the       second-floor front of No. 427, Park Lane, upon the thirtieth of       last month. That’s the charge, Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you       can endure the draught from a broken window, I think that half an       hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable       amusement.”        Our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision       of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I       entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old       landmarks were all in their place. There were the chemical corner       and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was       the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which       many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. The       diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack—even the Persian       slipper which contained the tobacco—all met my eyes as I glanced       round me. There were two occupants of the room—one, Mrs. Hudson,       who beamed upon us both as we entered—the other, the strange       dummy which had played so important a part in the evening’s       adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so       admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a       small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of Holmes’s so       draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely       perfect.        “I hope you observed all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?” said Holmes.        “I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.”        “Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe       where the bullet went?”        “Yes, sir. I’m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it       passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I       picked it up from the carpet. Here it is!”        Holmes held it out to me. “A soft revolver bullet, as you       perceive, Watson. There’s genius in that, for who would expect to       find such a thing fired from an airgun? All right, Mrs. Hudson. I       am much obliged for your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see       you in your old seat once more, for there are several points       which I should like to discuss with you.”        He had thrown off the seedy frockcoat, and now he was the Holmes       of old in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his       effigy.        “The old _shikari’s_ nerves have not lost their steadiness, nor       his eyes their keenness,” said he, with a laugh, as he inspected       the shattered forehead of his bust.        “Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through       the brain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there       are few better in London. Have you heard the name?”        “No, I have not.”        “Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember right, you       had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one       of the great brains of the century. Just give me down my index of       biographies from the shelf.”        He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and       blowing great clouds from his cigar.        “My collection of M’s is a fine one,” said he. “Moriarty himself       is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the       poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who       knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross,       and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.”        He handed over the book, and I read:        _Moran_, _Sebastian_, _Colonel_. Unemployed. Formerly 1st       Bangalore Pioneers. Born London, 1840. Son of Sir Augustus Moran,       C.B., once British Minister to Persia. Educated Eton and Oxford.       Served in Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign, Charasiab       (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of _Heavy Game of the       Western Himalayas_ (1881); _Three Months in the Jungle_ (1884).       Address: Conduit Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the       Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club.        On the margin was written, in Holmes’s precise hand:        The second most dangerous man in London.        “This is astonishing,” said I, as I handed back the volume. “The       man’s career is that of an honourable soldier.”        “It is true,” Holmes answered. “Up to a certain point he did       well. He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still       told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded       man-eating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a       certain height, and then suddenly develop some unsightly       eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have a theory       that the individual represents in his development the whole       procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good       or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line       of his pedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of       the history of his own family.”        “It is surely rather fanciful.”        “Well, I don’t insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran       began to go wrong. Without any open scandal, he still made India       too hot to hold him. He retired, came to London, and again       acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he was sought out       by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the       staff. Moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him       only in one or two very high-class jobs, which no ordinary       criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of       the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am       sure Moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could be proved.       So cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the       Moriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him. You       remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how       I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought       me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the       existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the       best shots in the world would be behind it. When we were in       Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly       he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.        “You may think that I read the papers with some attention during       my sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying       him by the heels. So long as he was free in London, my life would       really not have been worth living. Night and day the shadow would       have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come.       What could I do? I could not shoot him at sight, or I should       myself be in the dock. There was no use appealing to a       magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what would       appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But       I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I       should get him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My       chance had come at last. Knowing what I did, was it not certain       that Colonel Moran had done it? He had played cards with the lad,       he had followed him home from the club, he had shot him through       the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone       are enough to put his head in a noose. I came over at once. I was       seen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/108"],["title","The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#5)"],["body","the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the colonel’s       attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my sudden       return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure       that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way _at once_,       and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I       left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the       police that they might be needed—by the way, Watson, you spotted       their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy—I took up       what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never       dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. Now,       my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?”        “Yes,” said I. “You have not made it clear what was Colonel       Moran’s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair?”        “Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of       conjecture, where the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may       form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is       as likely to be correct as mine.”        “You have formed one, then?”        “I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came       out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had, between       them, won a considerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly       played foul—of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the       day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating.       Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to       expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the       club, and promised not to play cards again. It is unlikely that a       youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by       exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. Probably he       acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin       to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He therefore       murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how       much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by       his partner’s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies       should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing       with these names and coins. Will it pass?”        “I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.”        “It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come       what may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more. The famous       air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum,       and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to       examining those interesting little problems which the complex       life of London so plentifully presents.”     THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER         “From the point of view of the criminal expert,” said Mr.       Sherlock Holmes, “London has become a singularly uninteresting       city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty.”        “I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to       agree with you,” I answered.        “Well, well, I must not be selfish,” said he, with a smile, as he       pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. “The community is       certainly the gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor       out-of-work specialist, whose occupation has gone. With that man       in the field, one’s morning paper presented infinite       possibilities. Often it was only the smallest trace, Watson, the       faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me that the       great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the       edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the       centre. Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage—to the       man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected       whole. To the scientific student of the higher criminal world, no       capital in Europe offered the advantages which London then       possessed. But now——” He shrugged his shoulders in humorous       deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so       much to produce.        At the time of which I speak, Holmes had been back for some       months, and I at his request had sold my practice and returned to       share the old quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named       Verner, had purchased my small Kensington practice, and given       with astonishingly little demur the highest price that I ventured       to ask—an incident which only explained itself some years later,       when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes, and       that it was my friend who had really found the money.        Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had       stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period       includes the case of the papers of ex-President Murillo, and also       the shocking affair of the Dutch steamship _Friesland_, which so       nearly cost us both our lives. His cold and proud nature was       always averse, however, from anything in the shape of public       applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no       further word of himself, his methods, or his successes—a       prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been       removed.        Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his       whimsical protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a       leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a       tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow       drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with       his fist. As it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the       hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a       wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, disheveled, and       palpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one to the other       of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that       some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.        “I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes,” he cried. “You mustn’t blame me. I am       nearly mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.”        He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both       his visit and its manner, but I could see, by my companion’s       unresponsive face, that it meant no more to him than to me.        “Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,” said he, pushing his case       across. “I am sure that, with your symptoms, my friend Dr. Watson       here would prescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very       warm these last few days. Now, if you feel a little more       composed, I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair,       and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are, and what it is       that you want. You mentioned your name, as if I should recognize       it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that you are       a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know       nothing whatever about you.”        Familiar as I was with my friend’s methods, it was not difficult       for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of       attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the       breathing which had prompted them. Our client, however, stared in       amazement.        “Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes; and, in addition, I am the most       unfortunate man at this moment in London. For heaven’s sake,       don’t abandon me, Mr. Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I       have finished my story, make them give me time, so that I may       tell you the whole truth. I could go to jail happy if I knew that       you were working for me outside.”        “Arrest you!” said Holmes. “This is really most grati—most       interesting. On what charge do you expect to be arrested?”        “Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower       Norwood.”        My companion’s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I       am afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.        “Dear me,” said he, “it was only this moment at breakfast that I       was saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had       disappeared out of our papers.”        Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the       _Daily Telegraph_, which still lay upon Holmes’s knee.        “If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance       what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning. I       feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man’s       mouth.” He turned it over to expose the central page. “Here it       is, and with your permission I will read it to you. Listen to       this, Mr. Holmes. The headlines are: ‘Mysterious Affair at Lower       Norwood. Disappearance of a Well-known Builder. Suspicion of       Murder and Arson. A Clue to the Criminal.’ That is the clue which       they are already following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that it leads       infallibly to me. I have been followed from London Bridge       Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant       to arrest me. It will break my mother’s heart—it will break her       heart!” He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and       swayed backward and forward in his chair.        I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being       the perpetrator of a crime of violence. He was flaxen-haired and       handsome, in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue       eyes, and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His       age may have been about twenty-seven, his dress and bearing that       of a gentleman. From the pocket of his light summer overcoat       protruded the bundle of indorsed papers which proclaimed his       profession.        “We must use what time we have,” said Holmes. “Watson, would you       have the kindness to take"]]]
