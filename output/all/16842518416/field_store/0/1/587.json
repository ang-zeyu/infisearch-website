The time was coming now when he was to be tested, and the measure of his faculties taken in one of the greatest wars which darken the pages of history.  A single incident of public importance marks the life of Lee between 1855 and 1861. This was what is known to the world as the \"John Brown raid\"--an incident of the year 1859, and preluding the approaching storm. This occurrence is too well known to require a minute account in these pages, and we shall accordingly pass over it briefly, indicating simply the part borne in the affair by Lee. He was in Washington at the time--the fall of 1859--on a visit to his family, then residing at Arlington, near the city, when intelligence came that a party of desperadoes had attacked and captured Harper's Ferry, with the avowed intent of arming and inciting to insurrection the slaves of the neighborhood and entire State. Lee was immediately, thereupon, directed by President Buchanan to proceed to the point of danger and arrest the rioters. He did so promptly; found upon his arrival that Brown and his confederates had shut themselves up in an engine-house of the town, with a number of their prisoners. Brown was summoned to surrender, to be delivered over to the authorities for civil trial--he refused; and Lee then proceeded to assault, with a force of marines, the stronghold to which Brown had retreated. The doors were driven in, Brown firing upon the assailants and killing or wounding two; but he and his men were cut down and captured; they were turned over to the Virginia authorities, and Lee, having performed the duty assigned him returned to Washington, and soon afterward to Texas.  He remained there, commanding the department, until the early spring of 1861. He was then recalled to Washington at the moment when the conflict between the North and the South was about to commence.     VI.  LEE AND SCOTT.   Lee found the country burning as with fever, and the air hot with contending passions. The animosity, long smouldering between the two sections, was about to burst into the flame of civil war; all men were taking sides; the war of discussion on the floor of Congress was about to yield to the clash of bayonets and the roar of cannon on the battle-field.  Any enumeration of the causes which led to this unhappy state of affairs would be worse than useless in a volume like the present. Even less desirable would be a discussion of the respective blame to be attached to each of the great opponents in inaugurating the bitter and long-continued struggle. Such a discussion would lead to nothing, and would probably leave every reader of the same opinion as before. It would also be the repetition of a worn-out and wearisome story. These events are known of all men; for the political history of the United States, from 1820, when the slavery agitation began, on the question of the Missouri restriction, to 1861, when it ended in civil convulsion, has been discussed, rediscussed, and discussed again, in every journal, great and small, in the whole country. The person who is not familiar, therefore, with the main points at issue, must be ignorant beyond the power of any writer to enlighten him. We need only say that the election of Abraham Lincoln, the nominee of the Republican party, had determined the Gulf States to leave the Union. South Carolina accordingly seceded, on the 20th of December, 1860; and by the 1st of February, 1861, she had been followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The struggle thus approached. Military movements began at many points, like those distant flashes of lightning and vague mutterings which herald the tempest. Early in February Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was elected President of the Confederate States, at Montgomery. On the 13th of April Fort Sumter surrendered to General Beauregard, and on the next day, April 14, 1861, President Lincoln issued his proclamation declaring the Gulf States in rebellion, and calling upon the States which had not seceded for seventy-five thousand men to enforce the Federal authority.  Tip to this time the older State of Virginia had persistently resisted secession. Her refusal to array herself against the General Government had been based upon an unconquerable repugnance, it seemed, for the dissolution of that Union which she had so long loved; from real attachment to the flag which she had done so much to make honorable, and from a natural indisposition to rush headlong into a conflict whose whole fury would burst upon and desolate her own soil. The proclamation of President Lincoln, however, decided her course. The convention had obdurately refused, week after week, to pass the ordinance of secession. Now the naked question was, whether Virginia should fight with or against her sisters of the Gulf States. She was directed to furnish her quota of the seventy-five thousand troops called for by President Lincoln, and must decide at once. On the 17th of April, 1861, accordingly, an ordinance of secession passed the Virginia Convention, and that Commonwealth cast her fortunes for weal or woe with the Southern Confederacy.  Such is a brief and rapid summary of the important public events which had preceded, or immediately followed, Lee's return to Washington in March, 1861. A grave, and to him a very solemn, question demanded instant decision. Which side should he espouse--the side of the United States or that of the South? To choose either caused him acute pain. The attachment of the soldier to his flag is greater than the civilian can realize, and Lee had before him the brightest military prospects. The brief record which we have presented of his military career in Mexico conveys a very inadequate idea of the position which he had secured in the army. He was regarded by the authorities at Washington, and by the country at large, as the ablest and most promising of all the rising class of army officers. Upon General Winfield Scott, Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Army, he had made an impression which is the most striking proof of his great merit. General Scott was enthusiastic in his expressions of admiration for the young Virginian; and with the death of that general, which his great age rendered a probable event at any moment, Lee was sure to become a candidate for the highest promotion in the service. To this his great ability gave him a title at the earliest possible moment; and other considerations operated to advance his fortunes. He was conceded by all to be a person of the highest moral character; was the descendant of an influential and distinguished family, which had rendered important services to the country in the Revolution; his father had been the friend of Washington, and had achieved the first glories of arms, and the ample estates derived from his wife gave him that worldly prestige which has a direct influence upon the fortunes of an individual. Colonel Lee could thus look forward, without the imputation of presumption, to positions of the highest responsibility and honor under the Government. With the death of Scott, and other aged officers of the army, the place of commander-in-chief would fall to the most deserving of the younger generation; and of this generation there was no one so able and prominent as Lee.[1]  [Footnote 1: \"General Scott stated his purpose to recommend Lee as his successor in the chief command of the army.\"--_Hon. Reverdy Johnson_.]  The personal relations of Lee with General Scott constituted another powerful temptation to decide him against going over to the Southern side. We have referred to the great admiration which the old soldier felt for the young officer. He is said to have exclaimed on one occasion: \"It would be better for every officer in the army, including myself, to die than Robert Lee.\" There seems no doubt of the fact that Scott looked to Lee as his ultimate successor in the supreme command, for which his character and military ability peculiarly fitted him. Warm personal regard gave additional strength to his feelings in Lee's favor; and the consciousness of this regard on the part of his superior made it still more difficult for Lee to come to a decision.     VII.  LEE RESIGNS.   It is known that General Scott used every argument to persuade Lee not to resign. To retain him in the service, he had been appointed, on his arrival at Washington, a full colonel, and in 1860 his name had been sent in, with others, by Scott, as a proper person to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Brigadier-General Jessup. To these tempting intimations that rapid promotion would attend his adherence to the United States flag, Scott added personal appeals, which, coming from him, must have been almost irresistible.  \"For God's sake, don't resign, Lee!\" the lieutenant-general is said to have exclaimed. And, in the protracted interviews which took place between the two officers, every possible argument was urged by the elder to decide Lee to remain firm.  The attempt was in vain. Lee's attachment to the flag he had so long fought under, and his personal affection for General Scott, were great, but his attachment to his native State was still more powerful. By birth a Virginian, he declared that he owed his first duty to her and his own people. If she summoned him, he must obey the summons. As long as she remained in the Union he might remain in the United States Army. When she seceded from the Union, and took part with the Gulf States, he must follow her fortunes, and do his part in defending her. The struggle had been bitter, but brief. \"My husband has wept tears of blood,\" Mrs. Lee wrote to a friend, \"over this terrible war; but he must, as a man and a Virginian, share the destiny of his State, which has solemnly pronounced for independence.\"  The secession of Virginia, by a vote of the convention assembled at Richmond, decided Lee in his course. He no longer hesitated. To General"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10692"],["title","A Life of Gen. Robert E. Lee (#5)"],["body","ott's urgent appeals not to send in his resignation, he replied: \"I am compelled to. I cannot consult my own feelings in this matter.\" He accordingly wrote to General Scott from Arlington, on the 20th of April, enclosing his resignation. The letter was in the following words:      GENERAL: Since my interview with you, on the 18th instant, I have     felt that I ought not longer to retain my commission in the army.     I therefore tender my resignation, which I request you will     recommend for acceptance. It would have been presented at once but     for the struggle it has cost me to separate myself from a service     to which I have devoted all the best years of my life, and all the     ability I possessed.      During the whole of that time--more than a quarter of a century--I     have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors, and the     most cordial friendship from my comrades. To no one, general, have     I been as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and     consideration, and it has always been my ardent desire to merit     your approbation. I shall carry to the grave the most grateful     recollections of your kind consideration, and your name and fame     will always be dear to me.      Save in defence of my native State, I never desire again to draw     my sword. Be pleased to accept my most earnest wishes for the     continuance of your happiness and prosperity, and believe me, most     truly yours,      R.E. LEE. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT, _Commanding United     States Army_.  In this letter, full of dignity and grave courtesy, Lee vainly attempts to hide the acute pain he felt at parting from his friend and abandoning the old service. Another letter, written on the same day, expresses the same sentiment of painful regret:      ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, _April 20,1861_.      MY DEAR SISTER: I am grieved at my inability to see you ... I have     been waiting \"for a more convenient season,\" which has brought to     many before me deep and lasting regret. Now we are in a state of     war which will yield to nothing. The whole South is in a state of     revolution, into which Virginia, after a long struggle, has been     drawn, and, _though I recognize no necessity for this state of     things_, and would have forborne and pleaded to the end for     redress of grievances, real or supposed, yet in my own person I     had to meet the question, _whether I should take part against my     native State_. With all my devotion to the Union, and the feeling     of loyalty and duty of an American citizen, I have not been able     to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my     children, my home. I have, therefore, resigned my commission     in the army, and, save in defence of my native State, with the     sincere hope that my poor services may never be needed, I hope I     may never be called on to draw my sword.      I know you will blame me, but you must think as kindly of me as     you can, and believe that I have endeavored to do what I thought     right. To show you the feeling and struggle it has cost me, I send     a copy of my letter to General Scott, which accompanied my letter     of resignation. I have no time for more.... May God guard and     protect you and yours, and shower upon you every blessing, is the     prayer of your devoted brother,      R.E. LEE.  The expression used in this letter--\"though I recognize no necessity for this state of things\"--conveys very clearly the political sentiments of the writer. He did not regard the election of a Republican President, even by a strictly sectional vote, as sufficient ground for a dissolution of the Union. It may be added here, that such, we believe, was the opinion of a large number of Southern officers at that time. Accustomed to look to the flag as that which they were called upon to defend against all comers, they were loath to admit the force of the reasoning which justified secession, and called upon them to abandon it. Their final action seems to have been taken from the same considerations which controlled the course of Lee. Their States called them, and they obeyed.  In resigning his commission and going over to the South, Lee sacrificed his private fortunes, in addition to all his hopes of future promotion in the United States Army. His beautiful home, Arlington, situated upon the heights opposite Washington, must be abandoned forever, and fall into the hands of the enemy. This old mansion was a model of peaceful loveliness and attraction. \"All around here,\" says a writer, describing the place, \"Arlington Heights presents a lovely picture of rural beauty. The 'General Lee house,' as some term it, stands on a grassy lot, surrounded with a grove of stately trees and underwood, except in front, where is a verdant sloping ground for a few rods, when it descends into a valley, spreading away in beautiful and broad expanse to the lovely Potomac. This part of the splendid estate is apparently a highly-cultivated meadow, the grass waving in the gentle breeze, like the undulating bosom of Old Atlantic. To the south, north, and west, the grounds are beautifully diversified into hill and valley, and richly stored with oak, willow, and maple, though the oak is the principal wood. The view from the height is a charming picture. Washington, Georgetown, and the intermediate Potomac, are all before you in the foreground.\"  In this old mansion crowning the grassy hill, the young officer had passed the happiest moments of his life. All around him were spots associated with his hours of purest enjoyment. Each object in the house--the old furniture and very table-sets--recalled the memory of Washington, and were dear to him. Here were many pieces of the \"Martha Washington china,\" portions of the porcelain set presented to Mrs. Washington by Lafayette and others--in the centre of each piece the monogram \"M.W.\" with golden rays diverging to the names of the old thirteen States. Here were also fifty pieces, remnants of the set of one thousand, procured from China by the Cincinnati Society, and presented to Washington--articles of elaborate decoration in blue and gold, \"with the coat-of-arms of the society, held by Fame, with a blue ribbon, from which is suspended the eagle of the order, with a green wreath about its neck, and on its breast a shield representing the inauguration of the order.\" Add to these the tea-table used by Washington and one of his bookcases; old portraits, antique furniture, and other memorials of the Lee family from Stratford--let the reader imagine the old mansion stored with these priceless relics, and he will understand with what anguish Lee must have contemplated what came duly to pass, the destruction, by rude hands, of objects so dear to him. That he must have foreseen the fate of his home is certain. To take sides with Virginia was to give up Arlington to its fate.  There is no proof, however, that this sacrifice of his personal fortunes had any effect upon him. If he could decide to change his flag, and dissolve every tie which bound him to the old service, he could sacrifice all else without much regret. No one will be found to say that the hope of rank or emolument in the South influenced him. The character and whole career of the man contradict the idea. His ground of action may be summed up in a single sentence. He went with his State because he believed it was his duty to do so, and because, to ascertain what was his duty, and perform it, was the cardinal maxim of his life.     VIII.  HIS RECEPTION AT RICHMOND.   No sooner had intelligence of Lee's resignation of his commission in the United States Army reached Richmond, than Governor Letcher appointed him major-general of the military forces of Virginia. The appointment was confirmed by the convention, rather by acclamation than formal vote; and on the 23d of April, Lee, who had meanwhile left Washington and repaired to Richmond, was honored by a formal presentation to the convention.  The address of President Janney was eloquent, and deserves to be preserved. Lee stood in the middle aisle, and the president, rising, said:      \"MAJOR-GENERAL LEE: In the name of the people of our native State,     here represented, I bid you a cordial and heart-felt welcome to     this hall, in which we may almost yet hear the echoes of the     voices of the statesmen, the soldiers, and sages of by-gone days,     who have borne your name, and whose blood now flows in your veins.      \"We met in the month of February last, charged with the solemn     duty of protecting the rights, the honor, and the interests of the     people of this Commonwealth. We differed for a time as to the best     means of accomplishing that object, but there never was, at any     moment, a shade of difference among us as to the great object     itself; and now, Virginia having taken her position, as far as     the power of this convention extends, we stand animated by one     impulse, governed by one desire and one determination, and that     is, that she shall be defended, and that no spot of her soil shall     be polluted by the foot of an invader.      \"When the necessity became apparent of having a leader for our     forces, all hearts and all eyes, by the impulse of an instinct     which is a surer guide than reason itself, turned to the old     county of Westmoreland. We knew how prolific she had been in other     days of heroes and statesmen. We knew she had given birth to the     Father of his Country, to Richard Henry Lee, to Monroe, and last,     though not least, to your own gallant father, and we knew well, by     your deeds, that her productive power was not yet exhausted.      \"Sir, we watched with the most profound and intense interest the     triumphal march of the army led by General Scott, to which you     were attached, from Vera Cruz to the capital of Mexico. We read of     the sanguinary conflicts and the blood-stained fields, in all     of which"]]]
