Squire Davenport is a very selfish man, and he will care nothing for our comfort or convenience.\"  \"That is true,\" said the widow, with a sigh.  \"If I thought your going to New York would do any good, I would not grudge you the money--\"  \"Something will turn up, or I will turn up something,\" said Ben confidently.  When he asked Mr. Crawford for a day off, the latter responded: \"Yes, Ben, I think I can spare you, as Monday is not a very busy day.  Would you be willing to do an errand for me?\"  \"Certainly Mr. Crawford, with pleasure.\"  \"I need a new supply of prints.  Go to Stackpole & Rogers, No. ---- White Street, and select me some attractive patterns.  I shall rely upon your taste.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben, gratified by the compliment.  He received instructions as to price and quantity, which he carefully noted down.  \"As it will save me a journey, not to speak of my time, I am willing to pay your fare one way.\"  \"Thank you, sir; you are very kind.\"  Mr. Crawford took from the money drawer a dollar, and handed it to Ben.  \"But I buy an excursion ticket, so that my fare each way will be but seventy-five cents.\"  \"Never mind, the balance will go toward your dinner.\"  \"There, mother, what do you say now?\" said Ben, on Saturday night. \"Mr. Crawford is going to pay half my expenses, and I am going to buy some goods for him.\"  \"I am glad he reposes so much confidence in you, Ben.  I hope you won't lose his money.\"  \"Oh, I don't carry any.  He buys on thirty days.  All I have to do is to select the goods.\"  \"Perhaps it is for the best that you go, after all,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"At any rate, I hope so.\"  At half-past seven o'clock on Monday morning Ben stood on the platform of the Pentonville station, awaiting the arrival of the train.  \"Where are you going?\" said a voice.  Ben, turning, saw that it was Tom Davenport who had spoken.  \"I am going to New York,\" he answered briefly.  \"Has Crawford discharged you?\"  \"Why do you ask?  Would you like to apply for the position?\" asked Ben coolly.  \"Do you think I would condescend to be a grocer's boy?\" returned Tom disdainfully.  \"I don't know.\"  \"If I go into business it will be as a merchant.\"  \"I am glad to hear it.\"  \"You didn't say what you were going to New York for?\"  \"I have no objection to tell you, as you are anxious to know; I am going to the city to buy goods.\"  Tom looked not only amazed, but incredulous.  \"That's a likely story,\" said he, after a pause.  \"It is a true story.\"  \"Do you mean to say Crawford trusts you buy goods for him?\"  \"So it seems.\"  \"He must be getting weak-headed.\"  \"Suppose you call and give him that gratifying piece of information.\"  Just then the train came thundering up, and Ben jumped aboard.  Tom Davenport looked after him with a puzzled glance.  \"I wonder whether that boy tells the truth,\" he said to himself.  \"He thinks too much of himself, considering what he is.\"  It never occurred to Tom that the remark would apply even better to him than the boy he was criticising.  As a rule we are the last to recognize our own faults, however quick we may be to see the faults of others.  Two hours later Ben stood in front of the large dry-goods jobbing house of Stackpole & Rogers, in White Street.  He ascended the staircase to the second floor, which was very spacious and filled with goods in great variety.  \"Where is the department of prints?\" he inquired of a young man near the door.  He was speedily directed and went over at once.  He showed the salesman in charge a letter from Mr. Crawford, authorizing him to select a certain amount of goods.  \"You are rather a young buyer,\" said the salesman, smiling.  \"It is the first time I have served in that way,\" said Ben modestly; \"but I know pretty well what Mr. Crawford wants.\"  Half an hour was consumed in making his selections.  \"You have good taste,\" said the salesman, \"judging from your selections.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"If you ever come to the city to look for work, come here, and I will introduce you to the firm.\"  \"Thank you.  How soon can you ship the goods?\"  \"I am afraid not to-day, as we are very busy.  Early next week we will send them.\"  His business concluded, Ben left the store and walked up to Broadway. The crowded thoroughfare had much to interest him.  He was looking at a window when someone tapped him on the shoulder.  It was a young man foppishly attired, who was smiling graciously upon him.  \"Why, Gus Andre,\" he said, \"when did you come to town, and how did you leave all the folks in Bridgeport?\"  \"You have made a mistake,\" said Ben.  \"Isn't your name Gus Andre?\"  \"No, it is Ben Barclay, from Pentonville.\"  \"I really beg your pardon.  You look surprisingly like my friend Gussie.\"  Five minutes later there was another tap on our hero's shoulder, as he was looking into another window, and another nicely dressed young man said heartily: \"Why, Ben, my boy, when did you come to town?\"  \"This morning,\" answered Ben.  \"You seem to know me, but I can't remember you.\"  \"Are you not Ben Barclay, of Pentonville.\"  \"Yes, but----\"  \"Don't you remember Jim Fisher, who passed part of the summer, two years since, in your village?\"  \"Where were you staying?\" asked Ben.  It was the other's turn to looked confused.  \"At--the Smiths',\" he answered, at random.  \"At Mrs. Roxana Smith's?\" suggested Ben.  \"Yes, yes,\" said the other eagerly, \"she is my aunt.\"  \"Is she?\" asked Ben, with a smile of amusement, for he had by this time made up his mind as to the character of his new friend.  \"She must be proud of her stylish nephew.  Mrs. Smith is a poor widow, and takes in washing.\"  \"It's some other Smith,\" said the young man, discomfited.  \"She is the only one by that name in Pentonville.\"  Jim Fisher, as he called himself, turned upon his heel and left Ben without a word.  It was clear that nothing could be made out of him.  Ben walked all the way up Broadway, as far as Twenty-first Street, into which he turned, and walked eastward until he reached Gramercy Park, opposite which Lexington Avenue starts.  In due time he reached the house of Mr. Absalom Peters, and, ascending the steps, he rang the bell.  \"Is Mr. Peters in?\" he asked of the servant who answered the bell.  \"No.\"  \"Will he be in soon?\"  \"I guess not.  He sailed for Europe last week.\"  Ben's heart sank within him.  He had hoped much from Mr. Peters, before whom he meant to lay all the facts of his mother's situation. Now that hope was crushed.  He turned and slowly descended the steps.  \"There goes our last chance of saving the house,\" he said to himself sadly.     CHAPTER XI THE MADISON AVENUE STAGE   Ben was naturally hopeful, but he had counted more than he was aware on the chance of obtaining assistance from Absalom Peters toward paying off his mother's mortgage.  As Mr. Peters was in Europe nothing could be done, and them seemed absolutely no one else to apply to. They had friends, of course, and warm ones, in Pentonville, but none that were able to help them.  \"I suppose we must make up our minds to lose the house,\" thought Ben. \"Squire Davenport is selfish and grasping, and there is little chance of turning him.\"  He walked westward till he reached Madison Avenue.  A stage approached, being bound downtown, and, feeling tired, he got in.  The fare was but five cents, and he was willing to pay it.  Some half dozen other passengers beside himself were in the stage. Opposite Ben sat a handsomely dressed, somewhat portly lady, of middle age, with a kindly expression.  Next her sat a young man, attired fashionably, who had the appearance of belonging to a family of position.  There were, besides, an elderly man, of clerical appearance; a nurse with a small child, a business man, intent upon the financial column of a leading paper, and a schoolboy.  Ben regarded his fellow-passengers with interest.  In Pentonville he seldom saw a new face.  Here all were new.  Our young hero was, though be did not know it, an embryo student of human nature.  He liked to observe men and women of different classes and speculate upon their probable position and traits.  It so happened that his special attention was attracted to the fashionably-attired young man.  \"I suppose he belongs to a rich family, and has plenty of money,\" thought Ben.  \"It must be pleasant to be born with a gold spoon in your mouth, and know that you are provided for life.\"  If Ben had been wiser he would have judged differently.  To be born to wealth removes all the incentives to action, and checks the spirit of enterprise.  A boy or man who finds himself gradually rising in the world, through his own exertions, experiences a satisfaction unknown to one whose fortune is ready-made.  However, in Ben's present strait it is no wonder he regarded with envy the supposed young man of fortune.  Our hero was destined to be strangely surprised.  His eyes were unusually keen, and enabled him after a while to observe some rather remarkable movements on the part of the young man.  Though his eyes were looking elsewhere, Ben could see that his right hand was stealthily insinuating itself into the pocket of the richly-dressed lady at his side.  \"Is it possible that he is a pickpocket?\" thought Ben, in amazement. \"So nicely dressed as he is, too!\"  It did not occur to Ben that he dressed well the better to avert suspicion from his real character.  Besides, a man who lives at other people's expense can afford to dress well.  \"What shall I do?\" thought Ben, disturbed in mind.  \"Ought I not to warn the lady that she is in danger of losing her money?\"  While he was hesitating the deed was accomplished.  A pearl portemonnaie was adroitly drawn from the lady's pocket and transferred to that of the young man.  It was done with incredible swiftness, but Ben's sharp eyes saw it.  The young man yawned, and, turning away from the lady, appeared to be looking out of a window at the head of the coach.  \"Why, there is Jack Osborne,\" he said, half audibly, and, rising, pulled the strap"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10724"],["title","The Store Boy (#7)"],["body","the driver to stop the stage.  Then was the critical moment for Ben.  Was he to allow the thief to escape with the money.  Ben hated to get into a disturbance, but he felt that it would be wrong and cowardly to be silent.  \"Before you get out,\" he said, \"hand that lady her pocketbook.\"  The face of the pickpocket changed and he darted a malignant glance at Ben.  \"What do you mean, you young scoundrel?\" he said.  \"You have taken that lady's pocketbook,\" persisted Ben.  \"Do you mean to insult me?\"  \"I saw you do it.\"  With a half exclamation of anger, the young man darted to the door. But he was brought to a standstill by the business man, who placed himself in his way.  \"Not so fast, young man,\" he said resolutely.  \"Out of the way!\" exclaimed the thief, in a rage.  \"It's all a base lie.  I never was so insulted in my life.\"  \"Do you miss your pocketbook, madam?\" asked the gentleman, turning to the lady who had been robbed.  \"Yes,\" she answered.  \"It was in the pocket next to this man.\"  The thief seeing there was no hope of retaining his booty, drew it from his pocket and flung it into the lady's lap.  \"Now, may I go?\" he said.  There was no policeman in sight, and at a nod from the lady, the pickpocket was allowed to leave the stage.  \"You ought to have had him arrested.  He is a dangerous character,\" said the gentleman who had barred his progress.  \"It would have been inconvenient for me to appear against him,\" said the lady.  \"I am willing to let him go.\"  \"Well, there is one comfort--if he keeps on he will be hauled up sooner or later,\" remarked the gentleman.  \"Would your loss have been a heavy one?\" he inquired.  \"I had quite a large sum in my pocketbook, over two hundred dollars. But for my young friend opposite,\" she said, nodding kindly at Ben, \"I should have lost it with very small chance of recovery.\"  \"I am glad to have done you a service, madam,\" said Ben politely.  \"I know it is rather imprudent to carry so large sum about with me,\" continued the lady, but I have a payment to make to a carpenter who has done work in my house, and I thought he might not find it convenient use a check.\"  \"A lady is in more danger than a gentleman,\" observed the business man, \"as she cannot so well hide away her pocketbook.  You will need to be careful as you walk along the street.\"  \"I think it will be best to have a neighbor whom I can trust,\" said the lady.  \"Would you mind taking this seat at my side?\" she continued, addressing Ben.  \"I will change with pleasure,\" said our hero, taking the seat recently vacated by the pickpocket.  \"You have sharp eyes, my young friend,\" said his new acquaintance.  \"My eyes are pretty good,\" said Ben, with a smile.  \"They have done me good service to-day.  May I know to whom I am indebted for such timely help?\"  \"My name is Benjamin Barclay.\"  \"Do you live in the city?\"  \"No, madam.  I live in Pentonville, about thirty miles from New York.\"  \"I have heard of the place.  Are you proposing to live here?\"  \"No madam.  I came in to-day on a little business of my own, and also to select some goods for a country store in which I am employed.\"  \"You are rather young for such a commission.\"  \"I know the sort of goods Mr. Crawford sells, so it was not very difficult to make the selection.\"  \"At what time do you go back?\"  \"By the four o'clock train.\"  \"Have you anything to do meanwhile?\"  \"No, madam,\" answered Ben, a little surprised.  \"Then I should like to have you accompany me to the place where I am to settle my bill.  I feel rather timid after my adventure with our late fellow-passenger.\"  \"I shall be very happy to oblige you, madam,\" said Ben politely.  He had just heard a public clock strike one and he knew, therefore, that he would have plenty of time.     CHAPTER XII BEN'S LUCK   \"We will get out here,\" said Mrs. Hamilton.  They had reached the corner of Fourth Street and Broadway.  Ben pulled the strap, and with his new friend left the stage.  He offered his hand politely to assist the lady in descending.  \"He is a little gentleman,\" thought Mrs. Hamilton, who was much pleased with our hero.  They turned from Broadway eastward, and presently crossed the Bowery also.  Not far to the east of the last avenue they came to a carpenter's shop.  Mr. Plank, a middle-aged, honest-looking mechanic, looked up in surprise when Mrs. Hamilton entered the shop.  \"You didn't expect a call from me?\" said the lady pleasantly.  \"No, ma'am.  Fashionable ladies don't often find their way over here.\"  \"Then don't look upon me as a fashionable lady.  I like to attend to my business myself, and have brought you the money for your bill.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am.  You never made me wait.  But I am sorry you had the trouble to come to my shop.  I would have called at your house if you had sent me a postal.\"  \"My time was not so valuable as yours, Mr. Plank.  I must tell you, however, that you came near not getting your money this morning. Another person undertook to collect your bill.\"  \"Who was it?\" demanded the carpenter indignantly.  \"If there's anybody playing such tricks on me I will have him up before the courts.\"  \"It was no acquaintance of yours.  The person in question had no spite against you and you would only have suffered a little delay.\"  Then Mrs. Hamilton explained how a pickpocket had undertaken to relieve her of her wallet, and would have succeeded but for her young companion.  \"Oh they're mighty sharp, ma'am, I can tell you,\" said the carpenter. \"I never lost anything, because I don't look as if I had anything worth stealing; but if one of those rascals made up his mind to rob me, ten to one he'd do it.\"  Mr. Plank receipted his bill and Mrs. Hamilton paid him a hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents.  Ben could not help envying him as he saw the roll of bills transferred to him.  \"I hope the work was done satisfactory,\" said Mr. Plank. (Perfect grammar could not be expected of a man who, from the age of twelve, had been forced to earn his own living.)  \"Quite so, Mr. Plank,\" said the lady graciously.  \"I shall send for you when I have any more work to be done.\"  There was no more business to attend to, and Mrs. Hamilton led the way out, accompanied by Ben.  \"I will trouble you to see me as far as Broadway,\" said the lady.  \"I am not used to this neighborhood and prefer to have an escort.\"  \"I didn't think this morning,\" said Ben to himself, \"that a rich lady would select me as her escort.\"  On the whole, he liked it.  It gave him a feeling of importance, and a sense of responsibility which a manly boy always likes.  \"I shall be glad to stay with you as long as you like,\" said Ben.  \"Thank you, Benjamin, or shall I say Ben?\"  \"I wish you would.  I hardly know myself when I am called Benjamin.\"  \"As we are walking alone, suppose you tell me something of yourself. I only know your name, and that you live in Pentonville.  What relations have you?\"  \"A mother only--my father is dead.\"  \"And you help take care of your mother, I suppose?\"  \"Yes; father left us nothing except the house we live in, or, at least, we could get track of no other property.  He died in Chicago suddenly.\"  \"I hope you are getting along comfortably--you and your mother,\" said Mrs. Hamilton kindly.  \"We have our troubles,\" answered Ben.  \"We are in danger of having our house taken from us.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"A rich man in our village, Squire Davenport, has a mortgage of seven hundred dollars upon it.  He wants the house for a relative of his wife, and threatens to foreclose at the end of three months.\"  \"The house must be worth a good deal more than the mortgage.\"  \"It is worth twice as much; but if it is put up at auction I doubt if it will fetch over a thousand dollars.\"  \"This would leave your mother but three hundred?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Ben despondingly.  \"Have you thought of any way of raising the money?\"  \"Yes; I came up to the city to-day to see a cousin of mother's, a Mr. Absalom Peters, who lives on Lexington Avenue, and I had just come from there when I got into the stage with you.\"  \"Won't he help you?\"  \"Perhaps he might if he was in the city; though mother has seen nothing of him for twenty years; but, unfortunately, he just sailed for Europe.\"  \"That is indeed a pity.  I suppose you haven't much hope now?\"  \"Unless Mr. Peters comes back.  He is the only one we can think of to call upon.\"  \"What sort of a man is this Squire Davenport?\"  \"He is a very selfish man, who thinks only of his own interests.  We felt safe, because we did not suppose he would have any use for a small house like ours; but night before last he called on mother with the man he wants it for.\"  \"He cannot foreclose just yet, can he?\" asked Mrs. Hamilton.  \"No; we have three months to look around.\"  \"Three months is a long time,\" said the lady cheerfully. \"A good deal can happen in three months.  Do the best you can, and keep up hope.\"  \"I shall try to do so.\"  \"You have reason to do so.  You may not save your house, but you have, probably, a good many years before you, and plenty of good fortune may be in store for you.\"  The cheerful tone in which the lady spoke some how made Ben hopeful and sanguine, at any rate, for the time being.  \"In this country, the fact that you are a poor boy will not stand in the way of your success.  The most eminent men of the day, in all branches of business, and in all professions, were once poor boys.  I dare say, looking at me, you don't suppose I ever knew anything of poverty.\"  \"No,\" said Ben.  \"Yet I was the daughter of a bankrupt farmer, and my husband was clerk in a country store.  I am not going to tell you how he came to the city and prospered, leaving me, at his death, rich beyond my needs. Yet that is his history and mine.  Does it encourage you?  \"Yes, it does,\" answered Ben earnestly.  \"It is for that reason, perhaps, that I take an interest in country boys who are placed as my husband once was,\" continued Mrs. Hamilton. \"But here we are at Broadway.  It only remains to express my"]]]
