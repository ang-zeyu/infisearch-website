In the absence of her dear friend, Madame Iverney, the châtelaine of the château, she acted as their hostess. Her chauffeur showed the company cooks the way to the kitchen, the larder, and the charcoal-box. She, herself, in the hands of General Andre placed the keys of the famous wine-cellar, and to the surgeon, that the wounded might be freshly bandaged, intrusted those of the linen-closet. After the indignities she had suffered while \"detained\" by _les Boches_, her delight and relief at again finding herself under the protection of her own people would have touched a heart of stone. And the hearts of the staff were not of stone. It was with regret they gave the countess permission to continue on her way. At this she exclaimed with gratitude. She assured them, were her aunt able to travel, she would immediately depart.  \"In Paris she will be more comfortable than here,\" said the kind surgeon. He was a reservist, and in times of peace a fashionable physician and as much at his ease in a boudoir as in a field hospital. \"Perhaps if I saw Madame Benet?\"  At the suggestion the countess was overjoyed. But they found Madame Benet in a state of complete collapse. The conduct of the Germans had brought about a nervous breakdown.  \"Though the bridges are destroyed at Meaux,\" urged the surgeon, \"even with a detour, you can be in Paris in four hours. I think it is worth the effort.\"  But the mere thought of the journey threw Madame Benet into hysterics. She asked only to rest, she begged for an opiate to make her sleep. She begged also that they would leave the door open, so that when she dreamed she was still in the hands of the Germans, and woke in terror, the sound of the dear French voices and the sight of the beloved French uniforms might reassure her. She played her part well. Concerning her Marie felt not the least anxiety. But toward Briand, the chauffeur, the new arrivals were less easily satisfied.  The general sent his adjutant for the countess. When the adjutant had closed the door General Andre began abruptly:  \"The chauffeur Briand,\" he asked, \"you know him; you can vouch for him?\"  \"But, certainly!\" protested Marie. \"He is an Italian.\"  As though with sudden enlightenment, Marie laughed. It was as if now in the suspicion of the officer she saw a certain reasonableness. \"Briand was so long in the Foreign Legion in Algiers,\" she explained, \"where my husband found him, that we have come to think of him as French. As much French as ourselves, I assure you.\"  The general and his adjutant were regarding each other questioningly.  \"Perhaps I should tell the countess,\" began the general, \"that we have learned--\"  The signal from the adjutant was so slight, so swift, that Marie barely intercepted it.  The lips of the general shut together like the leaves of a book. To show the interview was at an end, he reached for a pen.  \"I thank you,\" he said.  \"Of course,\" prompted the adjutant, \"Madame d'Aurillac understands the man must not know we inquired concerning him.\"  General Andre frowned at Marie.  \"Certainly not!\" he commanded. \"The honest fellow must not know that even for a moment he was doubted.\"  Marie raised the violet eyes reprovingly.  \"I trust,\" she said with reproach, \"I too well understand the feelings of a French soldier to let him know his loyalty is questioned.\"  With a murmur of appreciation the officers bowed and with a gesture of gracious pardon Marie left them.  Outside in the hall, with none but orderlies to observe, like a cloak the graciousness fell from her. She was drawn two ways. In her work Anfossi was valuable. But Anfossi suspected was less than of no value; he became a menace, a death-warrant.  General Andre had said, \"We have learned--\" and the adjutant had halted him. What had he learned? To know that, Marie would have given much. Still, one important fact comforted her. Anfossi alone was suspected. Had there been concerning herself the slightest doubt, they certainly would not have allowed her to guess her companion was under surveillance; they would not have asked one who was herself suspected to vouch for the innocence of a fellow conspirator. Marie found the course to follow difficult. With Anfossi under suspicion his usefulness was for the moment at an end; and to accept the chance offered her to continue on to Paris seemed most wise. On the other hand, if, concerning Anfossi, she had succeeded in allaying their doubts, the results most to be desired could be attained only by remaining where they were.  Their position inside the lines was of the greatest strategic value. The rooms of the servants were under the roof, and that Briand should sleep in one of them was natural. That to reach or leave his room he should constantly be ascending or descending the stairs also was natural. The field-wireless outfit, or, as he had disdainfully described it, the \"knapsack\" wireless, was situated not in the bedroom he had selected for himself, but in one adjoining. At other times this was occupied by the maid of Madame Iverney. To summon her maid Madame Iverney, from her apartment on the second floor, had but to press a button. And it was in the apartment of Madame Iverney, and on the bed of that lady, that Madame Benet now reclined. When through the open door she saw an officer or soldier mount the stairs, she pressed the button that rang a bell in the room of the maid. In this way, long before whoever was ascending the stairs could reach the top floor, warning of his approach came to Anfossi. It gave him time to replace the dust-board over the fireplace in which the wireless was concealed and to escape into his own bedroom. The arrangement was ideal. And already information picked up in the halls below by Marie had been conveyed to Anfossi to relay in a French cipher to the German General Staff at Rheims.  Marie made an alert and charming hostess. To all who saw her it was evident that her mind was intent only upon the comfort of her guests. Throughout the day many came and went, but each she made welcome; to each as he departed she called \"_bonne chance_.\" Efficient, tireless, tactful, she was everywhere: in the dining-room, in the kitchen, in the bedrooms, for the wounded finding mattresses to spread in the gorgeous salons of the champagne prince; for the soldier-chauffeurs carrying wine into the courtyard, where the automobiles panted and growled, and the arriving and departing shrieked for right of way. At all times an alluring person, now the one woman in a tumult of men, her smart frock covered by an apron, her head and arms bare, undismayed by the sight of the wounded or by the distant rumble of the guns, the Countess d'Aurillac was an inspiring and beautiful picture. The eyes of the officers, young and old, informed her of that fact, one of which already she was well aware. By the morning of the next day she was accepted as the owner of the château. And though continually she reminded the staff she was present only as the friend of her schoolmate, Madame Iverney, they deferred to her as to a hostess. Many of them she already saluted by name, and to those who with messages were constantly motoring to and from the front at Soissons she was particularly kind. Overnight the legend of her charm, of her devotion to the soldiers of all ranks, had spread from Soissons to Meaux, and from Meaux to Paris. It was noon of that day when from the window of the second story Marie saw an armored automobile sweep into the courtyard. It was driven by an officer, young and appallingly good-looking, and, as was obvious by the way he spun his car, one who held in contempt both the law of gravity and death. That he was some one of importance seemed evident. Before he could alight the adjutant had raced to meet him. With her eye for detail Marie observed that the young officer, instead of imparting information, received it. He must, she guessed, have just arrived from Paris, and his brother officer either was telling him the news or giving him his orders. Whichever it might be, in what was told him the new arrival was greatly interested. One instant in indignation his gauntleted fist beat upon the steering-wheel, the next he smiled with pleasure. To interpret this pantomime was difficult; and, the better to inform herself, Marie descended the stairs.  As she reached the lower hall the two officers entered. To the spy the man last to arrive was always the one of greatest importance; and Marie assured herself that through her friend, the adjutant, to meet with this one would prove easy.  But the chauffeur commander of the armored car made it most difficult. At sight of Marie, much to her alarm, as though greeting a dear friend, he snatched his kepi from his head and sprang toward her.  \"The major,\" he cried, \"told me you were here, that you are Madame d'Aurillac.\" His eyes spoke his admiration. In delight he beamed upon her. \"I might have known it!\" he murmured. With the confidence of one who is sure he brings good news, he laughed happily. \"And I,\" he cried, \"am 'Pierrot'!\"  Who the devil \"Pierrot\" might be the spy could not guess. She knew only that she wished by a German shell \"Pierrot\" and his car had been blown to tiny fragments. Was it a trap, she asked herself, or was the handsome youth really some one the Countess d'Aurillac should know. But, as from his introducing himself it was evident he could not know that lady very well, Marie took courage and smiled.  \"_Which_ 'Pierrot'?\" she parried.  \"Pierre Thierry!\" cried the youth.  To the relief of Marie he turned upon the adjutant and to him explained who Pierre Thierry might be.  \"Paul d'Aurillac,\" he said, \"is my dearest friend. When he married this charming lady I was stationed in Algiers, and but for the war I might never have met her.\"  To Marie, with his hand on his heart in a most charming manner, he bowed. His admiration he made no effort to conceal.  \"And so,\" he said, \"I know why there is war!\"  The adjutant smiled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11144"],["title","Somewhere in France (#3)"],["body","gently, and departed on his duties, leaving them alone. The handsome eyes of Captain Thierry were raised to the violet eyes of Marie. They appraised her boldly and as boldly expressed their approval.  In burlesque the young man exclaimed indignantly: \"Paul deceived me!\" he cried. \"He told me he had married the most beautiful woman in Laon. He has married the most beautiful woman in France!\"  To Marie this was not impertinence, but gallantry.  This was a language she understood, and this was the type of man, because he was the least difficult to manage, she held most in contempt.  \"But about you, Paul did not deceive me,\" she retorted. In apparent confusion her eyes refused to meet his. \"He told me 'Pierrot' was a most dangerous man!\"  She continued hurriedly. With wifely solicitude she asked concerning Paul. She explained that for a week she had been a prisoner in the château, and, since the mobilization, of her husband save that he was with his regiment in Paris she had heard nothing. Captain Thierry was able to give her later news. Only the day previous, on the boulevards, he had met Count d'Aurillac. He was at the Grand Hôtel, and as Thierry was at once motoring back to Paris he would give Paul news of their meeting. He hoped he might tell him that soon his wife also would be in Paris. Marie explained that only the illness of her aunt prevented her from that same day joining her husband. Her manner became serious.  \"And what other news have you?\" she asked. \"Here on the firing-line we know less of what is going forward than you in Paris.\"  So Pierre Thierry told her all he knew. They were preparing despatches he was at once to carry back to the General Staff, and, for the moment, his time was his own. How could he better employ it than in talking of the war with a patriotic and charming French woman?  In consequence Marie acquired a mass of facts, gossip, and guesses. From these she mentally selected such information as, to her employers across the Aisne, would be of vital interest.  And to rid herself of Thierry and on the fourth floor seek Anfossi was now her only wish. But, in attempting this, by the return of the adjutant she was delayed. To Thierry the adjutant gave a sealed envelope.  \"Thirty-one, Boulevard des Invalides,\" he said. With a smile he turned to Marie. \"And you will accompany him!\"  \"I!\" exclaimed Marie. She was sick with sudden terror.  But the tolerant smile of the adjutant reassured her.  \"The count, your husband,\" he explained, \"has learned of your detention here by the enemy, and he has besieged the General Staff to have you convoyed safely to Paris.\" The adjutant glanced at a field telegram he held open in his hand. \"He asks,\" he continued, \"that you be permitted to return in the car of his friend, Captain Thierry, and that on arriving you join him at the Grand Hôtel.\"  Thierry exclaimed with delight.  \"But how charming!\" he cried. \"To-night you must both dine with me at La Rue's.\" He saluted his superior officer. \"Some petrol, sir,\" he said. \"And I am ready.\" To Marie he added: \"The car will be at the steps in five minutes.\" He turned and left them.  The thoughts of Marie, snatching at an excuse for delay, raced madly. The danger of meeting the Count d'Aurillac, her supposed husband, did not alarm her. The Grand Hôtel has many exits, and, even before they reached it, for leaving the car she could invent an excuse that the gallant Thierry would not suspect. But what now concerned her was how, before she was whisked away to Paris, she could convey to Anfossi the information she had gathered from Thierry. First, of a woman overcome with delight at being reunited with her husband she gave an excellent imitation; then she exclaimed in distress: \"But my aunt, Madame Benet!\" she cried. \"I cannot leave her!\"  \"The Sisters of St. Francis,\" said the adjutant, \"arrive within an hour to nurse the wounded. They will care also for your aunt.\"  Marie concealed her chagrin. \"Then I will at once prepare to go,\" she said.  The adjutant handed her a slip of paper. \"Your _laisser-passer_ to Paris,\" he said. \"You leave in five minutes, madame!\"  As temporary hostess of the château Marie was free to visit any part of it, and as she passed her door a signal from Madame Benet told her that Anfossi was on the fourth floor, that he was at work, and that the coast was clear. Softly, in the felt slippers she always wore, as she explained, in order not to disturb the wounded, she mounted the staircase. In her hand she carried the housekeeper's keys, and as an excuse it was her plan to return with an armful of linen for the arriving Sisters. But Marie never reached the top of the stairs. When her eyes rose to the level of the fourth floor she came to a sudden halt. At what she saw terror gripped her, bound her hand and foot, and turned her blood to ice.  At her post for an instant Madame Benet had slept, and an officer of the staff, led by curiosity, chance, or suspicion, had, unobserved and unannounced, mounted to the fourth floor. When Marie saw him he was in front of the room that held the wireless. His back was toward her, but she saw that he was holding the door to the room ajar, that his eye was pressed to the opening, and that through it he had pushed the muzzle of his automatic. What would be the fate of Anfossi Marie knew. Nor did she for an instant consider it. Her thoughts were of her own safety; that she might live. Not that she might still serve the Wilhelmstrasse, the Kaiser, or the Fatherland; but that she might live. In a moment Anfossi would be denounced, the château would ring with the alarm, and, though she knew Anfossi would not betray her, by others she might be accused. To avert suspicion from herself she saw only one way open. She must be the first to denounce Anfossi.  Like a deer she leaped down the marble stairs and, in a panic she had no need to assume, burst into the presence of the staff.  \"Gentlemen!\" she gasped, \"my servant--the chauffeur--Briand is a spy! There is a German wireless in the château. He is using it! I have seen him.\" With exclamations, the officers rose to their feet. General Andre alone remained seated. General Andre was a veteran of many Colonial wars: Cochin-China, Algiers, Morocco. The great war, when it came, found him on duty in the Intelligence Department. His aquiline nose, bristling white eyebrows, and flashing, restless eyes gave him his nickname of _l'Aigle_.  In amazement, the flashing eyes were now turned upon Marie. He glared at her as though he thought she suddenly had flown mad.  \"A German wireless!\" he protested. \"It is impossible!\"  \"I was on the fourth floor,\" panted Marie, \"collecting linen for the Sisters. In the room next to the linen closet I heard a strange buzzing sound. I opened the door softly. I saw Briand with his back to me seated by an instrument. There were receivers clamped to his ears! My God! The disgrace. The disgrace to my husband and to me, who vouched for him to you!\" Apparently in an agony of remorse, the fingers of the woman laced and interlaced. \"I cannot forgive myself!\"  The officers moved toward the door, but General Andre halted them. Still in a tone of incredulity, he demanded: \"When did you see this?\"  Marie knew the question was coming, knew she must explain how she saw Briand, and yet did not see the staff officer who, with his prisoner, might now at any instant appear. She must make it plain she had discovered the spy and left the upper part of the house before the officer had visited it. When that was she could not know, but the chance was that he had preceded her by only a few minutes.  \"When did you see this?\" repeated the general.  \"But just now,\" cried Marie; \"not ten minutes since.\"  \"Why did you not come to me at once?\"  \"I was afraid,\" replied Marie. \"If I moved I was afraid he might hear me, and he, knowing I would expose him, would kill me--and so _escape you!_\" There was an eager whisper of approval. For silence, General Andre slapped his hand upon the table.  \"Then,\" continued Marie, \"I understood with the receivers on his ears he could not have heard me open the door, nor could he hear me leave, and I ran to my aunt. The thought that we had harbored such an animal sickened me, and I was weak enough to feel faint. But only for an instant. Then I came here.\" She moved swiftly to the door. \"Let me show you the room,\" she begged; \"you can take him in the act.\" Her eyes, wild with the excitement of the chase, swept the circle. \"Will you come?\" she begged.  Unconscious of the crisis he interrupted, the orderly on duty opened the door.  \"Captain Thierry's compliments,\" he recited mechanically, \"and is he to delay longer for Madame d'Aurillac?\"  With a sharp gesture General Andre waved Marie toward the door. Without rising, he inclined his head. \"Adieu, madame,\" he said. \"We act at once upon your information. I thank you!\"  As she crossed from the hall to the terrace, the ears of the spy were assaulted by a sudden tumult of voices. They were raised in threats and curses. Looking back, she saw Anfossi descending the stairs. His hands were held above his head; behind him, with his automatic, the staff officer she had surprised on the fourth floor was driving him forward. Above the clenched fists of the soldiers that ran to meet him, the eyes of Anfossi were turned toward her. His face was expressionless. His eyes neither accused nor reproached. And with the joy of one who has looked upon and then escaped the guillotine, Marie ran down the steps to the waiting automobile. With a pretty cry of pleasure she leaped into the seat beside Thierry. Gayly she threw out her arms. \"To Paris!\" she commanded. The handsome eyes of Thierry, eloquent with admiration, looked back into hers. He stooped, threw in the clutch, and the great gray car, with the machine gun and its crew of privates guarding the rear, plunged through the park.  \"To Paris!\" echoed Thierry.  In the order in which Marie had last seen them, Anfossi and the"]]]
