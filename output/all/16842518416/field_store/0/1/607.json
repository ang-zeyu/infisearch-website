There are certain exceptions to the statement that roots descend into the ground; such as aërial roots and parasitic roots. The aërial roots of the Ivy have been mentioned. Other examples of roots used for climbing are the Trumpet Creeper _(Tecoma radicans)_, and the Poison Ivy _(Rhus Toxicodendron)_. Parasitic roots take their food ready-made from the plants into which they strike. The roots of air-plants, such as certain orchids, draw their nourishment from the air.  The experiment of marking roots and stem has been already tried, but it should be repeated. Repetition of experiments is always desirable, as it fixes his conclusions in the pupil's mind. The stem grows by a succession of similar parts, _phytomera_, each part, or _phyton_, consisting of node, internode, and leaf. Thus it follows that stems must bear leaves. The marked stems of seedlings show greater growth towards the top of the growing phyton. It is only young stems that elongate throughout. The older parts of a phyton grow little, and when the internode has attained a certain length, variable for different stems and different conditions, it does not elongate at all.  The root, on the contrary, grows only from a point just behind the tip. The extreme tip consists of a sort of cap of hard tissue, called the root-cap. Through a simple lens, or sometimes with the naked eye, it can be distinguished in most of the roots of the seedlings, looking like a transparent tip. \"The root, whatever its origin in any case may be, grows in length only in one way; namely, at a point just behind its very tip. This growing point is usually protected by a peculiar cap, which insinuates its way through the crevices of the soil. If roots should grow as stems escaping from the bud-state do,--that is, throughout their whole length--they would speedily become distorted. But, since they grow at the protected tips, they can make their way through the interstices of soil, which from its compactness would otherwise forbid their progress.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, p. 25.]  The third difference is that, while the stem bears leaves, and has buds normally developed in their axils, roots bear no organs. The stem, however, especially when wounded, may produce buds anywhere from the surface of the bark, and these buds are called _adventitious_ buds. In the same manner, roots occasionally produce buds, which grow up into leafy shoots, as in the Apple and Poplar.[1]  [Footnote 1: See Gray's Structural Botany, p. 29.]  It should be made perfectly clear that the stem is the axis of the plant, that is, it bears all the other organs. Roots grow from stems, not steins from roots, except in certain cases, like that of the Poplar mentioned above. This was seen in the study of the seedling. The embryo consisted of stem and leaves, and the roots were produced from the stem as the seedling grew.  For illustration of this point, the careful watching of the cuttings placed in water will be very instructive. After a few days, small, hard lumps begin to appear under the skin of the stem of the broken seedling Bean. These gradually increase in size until, finally, they rupture the skin and appear as rootlets. Roots are always thus formed under the outer tissues of the stem from which they spring, or the root from which they branch. In the Bean, the roots are in four long rows, quartering the stem. This is because they are formed in front of the woody bundles of the stem, which in the seedling Bean are four. In the Sunflower the roots divide the circumference into six parts. In some of my cuttings of Beans, the stem cracked in four long lines before the roots had really formed, showing the parenchyma in small hillocks, so to speak. In these the gradual formation of the root-cap could be watched throughout, with merely a small lens. I do not know a better way to impress the nature of the root on the pupil's mind. These forming roots might also be marked very early, and so be shown to carry onward their root-cap on the growing-point.   4. _Root-hairs_. These are outgrowths of the epidermis, or skin of the root, and increase its absorbing power. In most plants they cannot be seen without the aid of a microscope. Indian Corn and Oats, however, show them very beautifully, and the scholars have already noticed them in their seedlings. They are best seen in the seedlings grown on damp sponge. In those grown in sand, they become so firmly united to the particles of soil, that they cannot be separated, without tearing the hairs away from the plant. This will suggest the reason why plants suffer so much from careless transplanting.  The root-hairs have the power of dissolving mineral matters in the soil by the action of an acid which they give out. They then absorb these solutions for the nourishment of the plant. The acid given out was first thought to be carbonic acid, but now it is supposed by some experimenters to be acetic acid, by others to vary according to the plant and the time. The action can be shown by the following experiment, suggested by Sachs.  [Illustration: Fig. 12. I. Seedling of _Sinapis alba_ showing root-hairs. II. Same, showing how fine particles of sand cling to the root-hairs. (Sachs.)]  Cover a piece of polished marble with moist sawdust, and plant some seeds upon it. When the seedlings are somewhat grown, remove the sawdust, and the rootlets will be found to have left their autographs behind. Wherever the roots, with their root-hairs have crept, they have eaten into the marble and left it corroded. The marks will become more distinct if the marble is rubbed with a little vermilion.  In order that the processes of solution and absorption may take place, it is necessary that free oxygen should be present. All living things must have oxygen to breathe, and this gas is as needful for the germination of seeds, and the action of roots and leaves, as it is for our maintenance of life. It is hurtful for plants to be kept with too much water about their roots, because this keeps out the air. This is the reason why house-plants are injured if they are kept too wet.  A secondary office of root-hairs is to aid the roots of seedlings to enter the ground, as we have before noticed.  The root-hairs are found only on the young parts of roots. As a root grows older the root-hairs die, and it becomes of no further use for absorption. But it is needed now for another purpose, as the support of the growing plant. In trees, the old roots grow from year to year like stems, and become large and strong. The extent of the roots corresponds in a general way to that of the branches, and, as the absorbing parts are the young rootlets, the rain that drops from the leafy roof falls just where it is needed by the delicate fibrils in the earth below.[1]  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VI. The Relative Positions of Leaves and Rootlets.]   5. _Comparison of a Carrot, an Onion, and a Potato_.--It is a good exercise for a class to take a potato, an onion, and a carrot or radish to compare, writing out the result of their observations.  The carrot is a fleshy root, as we have already seen. The onion consists of the fleshy bases of last year's leaves, sheathed by the dried remains of the leaves of former years, from which all nourishment has been drawn. The parallel veining of the leaves is distinctly marked. The stem is a plate at the base, to which these fleshy scales are attached. In the centre, or in the axils of the scales, the newly-forming bulbs can be seen, in onions that are sprouting. If possible, compare other bulbs, as those of Tulip, Hyacinth, or Snowdrop, and the bulb of a Crocus, in which the fleshy part consists of the thickened base of the stem, and the leaves are merely dry scales. This is called a _corm_.  The potato is a thickened stem. It shows itself to be a stem, because it bears organs. The leaves are reduced to little scales (eyelids), in the axils of which come the buds (eyes). The following delightful experiment has been recommended to me.  In a growing potato plant, direct upwards one of the low shoots and surround it with a little cylinder of stiff carpet paper, stuffed with sphagnum and loam. Cut away the other tuber-disposed shoots as they appear. The enclosed shoot develops into a tuber which stands more or less vertical, and the scales become pretty little leaves. Removing the paper, the tuber and leaves become green, and the latter enlarge a little. A better illustration of the way in which organs adapt themselves to their conditions, and of the meaning of morphology, could hardly be found.  _Gray's First Lessons_. Sect. v, 65-88. _How Plants Grow_. Chap. I, 83-90.     IV.  BUDS AND BRANCHES.   1. There is an astonishing amount to be learned from naked branches, and, if pursued in the right way, the study will be found exceedingly interesting. Professor Beal, in his pamphlet on the New Botany,[1] says:--  \"Before the first lesson, each pupil is furnished or told where to procure some specimen for study. If it is winter, and flowers or growing plants cannot be had, give each a branch of a tree or shrub; this branch may be two feet long. The examination of these is made during the usual time for preparing lessons, and not while the class is before the teacher. For the first recitation each is to tell what he has discovered. The specimens are not in sight during the recitation. In learning the lesson, books are not used; for, if they are used, no books will contain a quarter of what the pupil may see for himself. If there is time, each member of the class is allowed a chance to mention anything not named by any of the rest. The teacher may suggest a few other points for study. The pupils are not told what they can see for themselves. An effort is made to keep them working after something which they have not yet discovered. If two members disagree on any point, on the next day, after further study, they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],["title","Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#6)"],["body","requested to bring in all the proofs they can to sustain their different conclusions. For a second lesson, the students review the first lesson, and report on a branch of a tree of another species which they have studied as before. Now they notice any point of difference or of similarity. In like manner new branches are studied and new comparisons made. For this purpose, naked branches of our species of elms, maples, ashes, oaks, basswood, beech, poplars, willows, walnut, butternut, hawthorns, cherries, and in fact any of our native or exotic trees or shrubs are suitable. A comparison of the branches of any of the evergreens is interesting and profitable. Discoveries, very unexpected, are almost sure to reward a patient study of these objects. The teacher must not think time is wasted. No real progress can be made, till the pupils begin to learn to see; and to learn to see they must keep trying to form the habit from the very first; and to form the habit they should make the study of specimens the main feature in the course of training.\"  [Footnote 1: The New Botany. By W.J. Beal. Philadelphia, C.H. Marot, 814 Chestnut St., 1882. Page 5.]  HORSECHESTNUT (_Æsculus Hippocastanum_).  We will begin with the study of a branch of Horsechestnut.[1] The pupils should examine and describe their specimens before discussing them in the class-room. They will need some directions and hints, however, to enable them to work to any advantage. Tell them to open both large and small buds. It is not advisable to study the Horsechestnut bud by cutting sections, as the wool is so dense that the arrangement cannot be seen in this way. The scales should be removed with a knife, one by one, and the number, texture, etc., noted. The leaves and flower-cluster will remain uncovered and will be easy to examine. The gum may be first removed by pressing the bud in a bit of paper. The scholars should study carefully the markings on the stem, in order to explain, if possible, what has caused them. The best way to make clear the meaning of the scars is to show them the relation of the bud to the branch. They must define a bud. Ask them what the bud would have become the next season, if it had been allowed to develop. It would have been a branch, or a part of one. A bud, then, is an undeveloped branch. They can always work out this definition for themselves. Conversely, a branch is a developed bud, or series of buds, and every mark on the branch must correspond to something in the bud. Let them examine the specimens with this idea clearly before their minds. The lesson to prepare should be to write out all they can observe and to make careful drawings of their specimens. Ask them to find a way, if possible, to tell the age of the branch.  [Footnote 1: The pupils should cut their names on their branches and keep them. They will need them constantly for comparison and reference.]  At the recitation, the papers can be read and the points mentioned thoroughly discussed. This will take two lesson-hours, probably, and the drawing may be left, if desired, as the exercise to prepare for the second recitation.  [1]The buds of Horsechestnut contain the plan of the whole growth of the next season. They are scaly and covered, especially towards the apex, with a sticky varnish. The scales are opposite, like the leaves. The outer pairs are wholly brown and leathery, the succeeding ones tipped with brown, wherever exposed, so that the whole bud is covered with a thick coat. The inner scales are green and delicate, and somewhat woolly, especially along the lapping edges. There are about seven pairs of scales. The larger terminal buds have a flower-cluster in the centre, and generally two pairs of leaves; the small buds contain leaves alone, two or three pairs of them. The leaves are densely covered with white wool, to protect them from the sudden changes of winter. The use of the gum is to ward off moisture. The flower-cluster is woolly also.  [Footnote 1: All descriptions are made from specimens examined by me. Other specimens may differ in some points. Plants vary in different situations and localities.]  The scars on the stem are of three kinds, leaf, bud-scale, and flower-cluster scars. The pupils should notice that the buds are always just above the large triangular scars. If they are still in doubt as to the cause of these marks, show them some house-plant with well-developed buds in the axils of the leaves, and ask them to compare the position of these buds with their branches. The buds that spring from the inner angle of the leaf with the stem are _axillary_ buds; those that crown the stems are _terminal_. Since a bud is an undeveloped branch, terminal buds carry, on the axis which they crown, axillary buds give rise to side-shoots. The leaf-scars show the leaf-arrangement and the number of leaves each year. The leaves are opposite and each pair stands over the intervals of the pair below. The same is observed to be true of the scales and leaves of the bud.[1] All these points should be brought out by the actual observation of the specimens by the pupils, with only such hints from the teacher as may be needed to direct their attention aright. The dots on the leaf-scar are the ends of woody bundles (fibro-vascular bundles) which, in autumn, separated from the leaf. By counting these we can tell how many leaflets there were in the leaf, three, five, seven, nine, or occasionally six or eight.  [Footnote 1: Bud-scales are modified leaves and their arrangement is therefore the same as the leaves. This is not mentioned in the study of the Horsechestnut bud, because it cannot be proved to the pupils, but the transition is explained in connection with Lilac, where it may be clearly seen. The scales of the bud of Horsechestnut are considered to be homologous with petioles, by analogy with other members of the same family. In the Sweet Buckeye a series can be made, exhibiting the gradual change from a scale to a compound leaf. See the Botanical Text-Book, Part I, Structural Botany. By Asa Gray. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor and Co., New York, 1879. Plate 233, p. 116.]  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Horsechestnut. I. Branch in winter state: _a_, leaf-scars; _b_, bud-scars; _c_, flower-scars. 2. An expanding leaf-bud. 3. Same, more advanced.]  _The Bud Scale-Scars_. These are rings left by the scales of the bud and may be seen in many branches. They are well seen in Horsechestnut. If the pupils have failed to observe that these rings show the position of former buds and mark the growth of successive years, this point must be brought out by skilful questioning. There is a difference in the color of the more recent shoots, and a pupil, when asked how much of his branch grew the preceding season, will be able to answer by observing the change in color. Make him see that this change corresponds with the rings, and he will understand how to tell every year's growth. Then ask what would make the rings in a branch produced from one of his buds, and he can hardly fail to see that the scales would make them. When the scholars understand that the rings mark the year's growth, they can count them and ascertain the age of each branch. The same should be done with each side-shoot. Usually the numbers will be found to agree; that is, all the buds will have the same number of rings between them and the cut end of the branch, but occasionally a bud will remain latent for one or several seasons and then begin its growth, in which case the numbers will not agree; the difference will be the number of years it remained latent. There are always many buds that are not developed. \"The undeveloped buds do not necessarily perish, but are ready to be called into action in case the others are checked. When the stronger buds are destroyed, some that would else remain dormant develop in their stead, incited by the abundance of nourishment which the former would have monopolized. In this manner our trees are soon reclothed with verdure, after their tender foliage and branches have been killed by a late vernal frost, or consumed by insects. And buds which have remained latent for several years occasionally shoot forth into branches from the sides of old stems, especially in certain trees.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Structural Botany, p. 48.]  The pupils can measure the distance between each set of rings on the main stem, to see on what years it grew best.  _The Flower-Cluster Scars_. These are the round, somewhat concave, scars, found terminating the stem where forking occurs, or seemingly in the axils of branches, on account of one of the forking branches growing more rapidly and stoutly than the other and thus taking the place of the main stem, so that this is apparently continued without interruption. If the pupils have not understood the cause of the flower-cluster scars, show them their position in shoots where they are plainly on the summit of the stem, and tell them to compare this with the arrangement of a large bud. The flower-cluster terminates the axis in the bud, and this scar terminates a branch. When the terminal bud is thus prevented from continuing its growth, the nearest axillary buds are developed.[1] One shoot usually gets the start, and becomes so much stronger that it throws the other to one side. The tendency of the Horsechestnut to have its growth carried on by the terminal buds is so strong that I almost feel inclined to say that vigorous branches are never formed from axillary buds, in old trees, except where the terminal bud has been prevented from continuing the branch. This tendency gives to the tree its characteristic size of trunk and branches, and lack of delicate spray. On looking closely at the branches also, they will be seen to be quite irregular, wherever there has been a flower-cluster swerving to one side or the other.  [Footnote 1: The first winter that I examined Horsechestnut buds I found, in many cases, that the axillary shoots had from a quarter of an inch to an"]]]
