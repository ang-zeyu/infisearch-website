The list of her eccentricities is far too lengthy here to be enumerated; but she began it by being born with red hair--Titian reds and auburns were undiscovered euphemisms in those days--and, in Lichfield, this is not regarded as precisely a lady-like thing to do; and she ended it, as far as Lichfield was concerned, by eloping with what Lichfield in its horror could only describe, with conscious inadequacy, as \"a quite unheard-of person.\"  Indisputably the man was well-to-do already; and from this nightmarish topsy-turvidom of Reconstruction the fellow visibly was plucking wealth. Also young Stapylton was well enough to look at, too, as Lichfield flurriedly conceded.  But it was equally undeniable that he had made his money through a series of commercial speculations distinguished both by shiftiness and daring, and that the man himself had been until the War a wholly negligible \"poor white\" person,--an overseer, indeed, for \"Wild Will\" Musgrave, Colonel Musgrave's father, who was of course the same Lieutenant-Colonel William Sebastian Musgrave, C.S.A., that met his death at Gettysburg.  This upstart married Patricia Vartrey, for all the chatter and whispering, and carried her away from Lichfield, as yet a little dubious as to what recognition, if any, should be accorded the existence of the Stapyltons. And afterward (from a notoriously untruthful North, indeed) came rumors that he was rapidly becoming wealthy; and of Patricia Vartrey's death at her daughter's birth; and of the infant's health and strength and beauty, and of her lavish upbringing,--a Frenchwoman, Lichfield whispered, with absolutely nothing to do but attend upon the child.  And then, little by little, a new generation sprang up, and, little by little, the interest these rumors waked became more lax; and it was brought about, at last, by the insidious transitions of time, that Patricia Vartrey was forgotten in Lichfield. Only a few among the older men remembered her; some of them yet treasured, as these fogies so often do, a stray fan or an odd glove; and in bycorners of sundry time-toughened hearts there lurked the memory of a laughing word or of a glance or of some such casual bounty, that Patricia Vartrey had accorded these hearts' owners when the world was young.  But Agatha Musgrave, likewise, remembered the orphan cousin who had been reared with her. She had loved Patricia Vartrey; and, in due time, she wrote to Patricia's daughter,--in stately, antiquated phrases that astonished the recipient not a little,--and the girl had answered. The correspondence flourished. And it was not long before Miss Musgrave had induced her young cousin to visit Lichfield.  Colonel Rudolph Musgrave, be it understood, knew nothing of all this until the girl was actually on her way. And now, she was to arrive that afternoon, to domicile herself in his quiet house for two long weeks--this utter stranger, look you!--and upset his comfort, ask him silly questions, expect him to talk to her, and at the end of her visit, possibly, present him with some outlandish gimcrack made of cardboard and pink ribbons, in which she would expect him to keep his papers. The Langham girl did that.         *       *       *       *       *  It is honesty's part to give you the man no better than he was. Lichfield at large had pampered him; many women had loved him; and above all, Miss Agatha had spoiled him. After fifteen years of being the pivot about which the economy of a household revolves, after fifteen years of being the inevitable person whose approval must be secured before any domestic alteration, however trivial, may be considered, no mortal man may hope to remain a paragon of unselfishness.  Colonel Musgrave joyed in the society of women. But he classed them--say, with the croquettes adorned with pink paper frills which were then invariably served at the suppers of the Lichfield German Club,--as acceptable enough, upon a conscious holiday, but wholly incongruous with the slippered ease of home. When you had an inclination for feminine society, you shaved and changed your clothes and thought up an impromptu or so against emergency, and went forth to seek it. That was natural; but to have a petticoated young person infesting your house, hourly, was as preposterous as ice-cream soda at breakfast.  The metaphor set him off at a tangent. He wondered if this Patricia person could not (tactfully) be induced to take her bath after breakfast, as Agatha did? after he had his? Why, confound the girl, he was not responsible for there being only one bathroom in the house! It was necessary for him to have his bath and be at the Library by nine o'clock. This interloper must be made to understand as much.  The colonel reached the Library undecided as to whether Miss Stapylton had better breakfast in her room, or if it would be entirely proper for her to come to the table in one of those fluffy lace-trimmed garments such as Agatha affected at the day's beginning?  The question was a nice one. It was not as though servants were willing to be bothered with carrying trays to people's rooms; he knew what Agatha had to say upon that subject. It was not as though he were the chit's first cousin, either. He almost wished himself in the decline of life, and free to treat the girl paternally.  And so he fretted all that afternoon.         *       *       *       *       *  Then, too, he reflected that it would be very awkward if Agatha should be unwell while this Patricia person was in the house. Agatha in her normal state was of course the kindliest and cheeriest gentlewoman in the universe, but any physical illness appeared to transform her nature disastrously. She had her \"attacks,\" she \"felt badly\" very often nowadays, poor dear; and how was a Patricia person to be expected to make allowances for the fact that at such times poor Agatha was unavoidably a little cross and pessimistic?     V   Yet Colonel Musgrave strolled into his garden, later, with a tolerable affectation of unconcern. Women, after all, he assured himself, were necessary for the perpetuation of the species; and, resolving for the future to view these weakly, big-hipped and slope-shouldered makeshifts of Nature's with larger tolerance, he cocked his hat at a devil-may-carish angle, and strode up the walk, whistling jauntily and having, it must be confessed, to the unprejudiced observer very much the air of a sheep in wolf's clothing.  \"At worst,\" he was reflecting, \"I can make love to her. They, as a rule, take kindlily enough to that; and in the exercise of hospitality a host must go to all lengths to divert his guests. Failure is not permitted....\"  Then She came to him.  She came to him across the trim, cool lawn, leisurely, yet with a resilient tread that attested the vigor of her slim young body. She was all in white, diaphanous, ethereal, quite incredibly incredible; but as she passed through the long shadows of the garden--fire-new, from the heart of the sunset, Rudolph Musgrave would have sworn to you,--the lacy folds and furbelows and semi-transparencies that clothed her were now tinged with gold, and now, as a hedge or flower-bed screened her from the horizontal rays, were softened into multitudinous graduations of grays and mauves and violets.  \"Failure is not permitted,\" he was repeating in his soul....  \"You're Cousin Rudolph, aren't you?\" she asked. \"How perfectly entrancing! You see until to-day I always thought that if I had been offered the choice between having cousins or appendicitis I would have preferred to be operated on.\"  And Rudolph Musgrave noted, with a delicious tingling somewhere about his heart, that her hair was really like the reflection of a sunset in rippling waters,--only many times more beautiful, of course,--and that her mouth was an inconsiderable trifle, a scrap of sanguine curves, and that her eyes were purple glimpses of infinity.  Then he observed that his own mouth was giving utterance to divers irrelevant and foolish sounds, which eventually resolved themselves into the statement he was glad to see her. And immediately afterward the banality of this remark brought the hot blood to his face and, for the rest of the day, stung him and teased him, somewhere in the background of his mind, like an incessant insect.  Glad, indeed!  Before he had finished shaking hands with Patricia Stapylton, it was all over with the poor man.  \"Er--h'm!\" quoth he.  \"Only,\" Miss Stapylton was meditating, with puckered brow, \"it would be unseemly for me to call you Rudolph--\"  \"You impertinent minx!\" cried he, in his soul; \"I should rather think it would be!\"  \"--and Cousin Rudolph sounds exactly like a dried-up little man with eyeglasses and crows' feet and a gentle nature. I rather thought you were going to be like that, and I regard it as extremely hospitable of you not to be. You are more like--like what now?\" Miss Stapylton put her head to one side and considered the contents of her vocabulary,--\"you are like a viking. I shall call you Olaf,\" she announced, when she had reached a decision.  This, look you, to the most dignified man in Lichfield,--a person who had never borne a nickname in his life. You must picture for yourself how the colonel stood before her, big, sturdy and blond, and glared down at her, and assured himself that he was very indignant; like Timanthes, the colonel's biographer prefers to draw a veil before the countenance to which art is unable to do justice.  Then, \"I have no admiration for the Northmen,\" Rudolph Musgrave declared, stiffly. \"They were a rude and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10041"],["title","The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck: A Comedy of Limitations (#3)"],["body","nation, proverbially addicted to piracy and intemperance.\"  \"My goodness gracious!\" Miss Stapylton observed,--and now, for the first time, he saw the teeth that were like grains of rice upon a pink rose petal. Also, he saw dimples. \"And does one mean all that by a viking?\"  \"The vikings,\" he informed her--and his Library manner had settled upon him now to the very tips of his fingers--\"were pirates. The word is of Icelandic origin, from _vik_, the name applied to the small inlets along the coast in which they concealed their galleys. I may mention that Olaf was not a viking, but a Norwegian king, being the first Christian monarch to reign in Norway.\"  \"Dear me!\" said Miss Stapylton; \"how interesting!\"  Then she yawned with deliberate cruelty.  \"However,\" she concluded, \"I shall call you Olaf, just the same.\"  \"Er--h'm!\" said the colonel.         *       *       *       *       *  And this stuttering boor (he reflected) was Colonel Rudolph Musgrave, confessedly the social triumph of his generation! This imbecile, without a syllable to say for himself, without a solitary adroit word within tongue's reach, wherewith to annihilate the hussy, was a Musgrave of Matocton!         *       *       *       *       *  And she did. To her he was \"Olaf\" from that day forth.  Rudolph Musgrave called her, \"You.\" He was nettled, of course, by her forwardness--\"Olaf,\" indeed!--yet he found it, somehow, difficult to bear this fact in mind continuously.  For while it is true our heroes and heroines in fiction no longer fall in love at first sight, Nature, you must remember, is too busily employed with other matters to have much time to profit by current literature. Then, too, she is not especially anxious to be realistic. She prefers to jog along in the old rut, contentedly turning out chromolithographic sunrises such as they give away at the tea stores, contentedly staging the most violent and improbable melodramas; and--sturdy old Philistine that she is--she even now permits her children to fall in love in the most primitive fashion.  She is not particularly interested in subtleties and soul analyses; she merely chuckles rather complacently when a pair of eyes are drawn, somehow, to another pair of eyes, and an indescribable something is altered somewhere in some untellable fashion, and the world, suddenly, becomes the most delightful place of residence in all the universe. Indeed, it is her favorite miracle, this. For at work of this sort the old Philistine knows that she is an adept; and she has rejoiced in the skill of her hands, with a sober workmanly joy, since Cain first went a-wooing in the Land of Nod.  So Colonel Rudolph Musgrave, without understanding what had happened to him, on a sudden was strangely content with life.  It was at supper--dinner, in Lichfield, when not a formal entertainment, is eaten at two in the afternoon--that he fell a-speculating as to whether Her eyes, after all, could be fitly described as purple.  Wasn't there a grayer luminosity about them than he had at first suspected?--wasn't the cool glow of them, in a word, rather that of sunlight falling upon a wet slate roof?  It was a delicate question, an affair of nuances, of almost imperceptible graduations; and in debating a matter of such nicety, a man must necessarily lay aside all petty irritation, such as being nettled by an irrational nickname, and approach the question with unbiased mind.  He did. And when, at last, he had come warily to the verge of decision, Miss Musgrave in all innocence announced that they would excuse him if he wished to get back to his work.  He discovered that, somehow, the three had finished supper; and, somehow, he presently discovered himself in his study, where eight o'clock had found him every evening for the last ten years, when he was not about his social diversions. An old custom, you will observe, is not lightly broken.     VI   Subsequently: \"I have never approved of these international marriages,\" said Colonel Musgrave, with heat. \"It stands to reason, she is simply marrying the fellow for his title. _(The will of Jeremiah Brown, dated 29 November, 1690, recorded 2 February, 1690-1, mentions his wife Eliza Brown and appoints her his executrix.)_ She can't possibly care for him. _(This, then, was the second wife of Edward Osborne of Henrico, who, marrying him 15 June, 1694, died before January, 1696-7.)_ But they are all flibbertigibbets, every one of them. _(She had apparently no children by either marriage--)_ And I dare say she is no better than the rest.\"  Came a tap on the door. Followed a vision of soft white folds and furbelows and semi-transparencies and purple eyes and a pouting mouth.  \"I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, Olaf,\" the owner of these vanities complained. \"Are you very busy? Cousin Agatha is about her housekeeping, and I have read the afternoon paper all through,--even the list of undelivered letters and the woman's page,--and I just want to see the Gilbert Stuart picture,\" she concluded,--exercising, one is afraid, a certain economy in regard to the truth.  This was a little too much. If a man's working-hours are not to be respected--if his privacy is to be thus invaded on the flimsiest of pretexts,--why, then, one may very reasonably look for chaos to come again. This, Rudolph Musgrave decided, was a case demanding firm and instant action. Here was a young person who needed taking down a peg or two, and that at once.  But he made the mistake of looking at her first. And after that, he lied glibly. \"Good Lord, no! I am not in the least busy now. In fact, I was just about to look you two up.\"  \"I was rather afraid of disturbing you.\" She hesitated; and a lucent mischief woke in her eyes. \"You are so patriarchal, Olaf,\" she lamented. \"I felt like a lion venturing into a den of Daniels. But if you cross your heart you aren't really busy--why, then, you can show me the Stuart, Olaf.\"  It is widely conceded that Gilbert Stuart never in his after work surpassed the painting which hung then in Rudolph Musgrave's study,--the portrait of the young Gerald Musgrave, afterward the friend of Jefferson and Henry, and, still later, the author of divers bulky tomes, pertaining for the most part to ethnology. The boy smiles at you from the canvas, smiles ambiguously,--smiles with a woman's mouth, set above a resolute chin, however,--and with a sort of humorous sadness in his eyes. These latter are of a dark shade of blue--purple, if you will,--and his hair is tinged with red.  \"Why, he took after me!\" said Miss Stapylton. \"How thoughtful of him, Olaf!\"  And Rudolph Musgrave saw the undeniable resemblance. It gave him a queer sort of shock, too, as he comprehended, for the first time, that the faint blue vein on that lifted arm held Musgrave blood,--the same blood which at this thought quickened. For any person guided by appearances, Rudolph Musgrave considered, would have surmised that the vein in question contained celestial ichor or some yet diviner fluid.  \"It is true,\" he conceded, \"that there is a certain likeness.\"  \"And he is a very beautiful boy,\" said Miss Stapylton, demurely. \"Thank you, Olaf; I begin to think you are a dangerous flatterer. But he is only a boy, Olaf! And I had always thought of Gerald Musgrave as a learned person with a fringe of whiskers all around his face--like a centerpiece, you know.\"  The colonel smiled. \"This portrait was painted early in life. Our kinsman was at that time, I believe, a person of rather frivolous tendencies. Yet he was not quite thirty when he first established his reputation by his monograph upon _The Evolution of Marriage_. And afterwards, just prior to his first meeting with Goethe, you will remember--\"  \"Oh, yes!\" Miss Stapylton assented, hastily; \"I remember perfectly. I know all about him, thank you. And it was that beautiful boy, Olaf, that young-eyed cherub, who developed into a musty old man who wrote musty old books, and lived a musty, dusty life all by himself, and never married or had any fun at all! How _horrid_, Olaf!\" she cried, with a queer shrug of distaste.  \"I fail,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"to perceive anything--ah--horrid in a life devoted to the study of anthropology. His reputation when he died was international.\"  \"But he never had any fun, you jay-bird! And, oh, Olaf! Olaf! that boy could have had so much fun! The world held so much for him! Why, Fortune is only a woman, you know, and what woman could have refused him anything if he had smiled at her like that when he asked for it?\"  Miss Stapylton gazed up at the portrait for a long time now, her hands clasped under her chin. Her face was gently reproachful.  \"Oh, boy dear, boy dear!\" she said, with a forlorn little quaver in her voice, \"how _could_ you be _so_ foolish? _Didn't_ you know there was something better in the world than grubbing after musty old tribes and customs and folk-songs? Oh, precious child, how could you?\"  Gerald Musgrave smiled back at her, ambiguously; and Rudolph Musgrave laughed. \"I perceive,\" said he, \"you are a follower of Epicurus. For my part, I must have fetched my ideals from the tub of the Stoic. I can conceive of no nobler life than one devoted to furthering the cause of science.\"  She looked up at him, with a wan smile. \"A barren life!\" she said: \"ah, yes, his was a wasted life! His books are all out-of-date now, and nobody reads them, and it is just as if he had never been. A barren life, Olaf! And that beautiful boy might have had so much fun--Life is queer, isn't it, Olaf?\"  Again he laughed, \"The criticism,\" he suggested, \"is not altogether original. And Science, no less than War, must have her unsung heroes. You must remember,\" he continued, more seriously, \"that any great work must have as its foundation the achievements of unknown men. I fancy that Cheops did not lay every brick in his pyramid with his own hand; and I dare say Nebuchadnezzar employed a few helpers when he was laying out his hanging gardens. But "]]]
