Even Keziah finally admitted, in her own mind, that such a change in Dabney's appearance might have its advantages. But Samantha inwardly declared war.  The young hero himself was hardly used to that second suit, as yet, and felt any thing but easy in it.  \"I wonder,\" he said to himself, \"what Jenny Walters would say to me now. Wonder if she'd know me.\"  Not a doubt of it. But after he had finished his breakfast, and gone out, his mother remarked,--  \"It's really all right, girls. I almost fear I have been neglecting Dabney. He isn't a little boy any more.\"  \"He isn't a man yet,\" exclaimed Samantha. \"And he talks slang dreadfully.\"  \"But then, he does grow so!\" remarked Keziah.  \"Mother,\" said Pamela, \"couldn't you get Dab to give Dick Lee the slang, along with the old clothes?\"  \"We'll see about it,\" replied Mrs. Kinzer.  It was very clear that Dabney's mother had begun to take in a new idea about her son.  It was not the least bit in the world unpleasant to find out that he was \"growing in more ways than one,\" and it was quite likely that she had indeed kept him too long in roundabouts.  At all events, his great idea had been worked out into a triumphant success; and, before the evening was over, Pamela replied to a remark of Samantha's,--  \"I don't care. He's taller than I am, and I'd ever so much rather have a frock-coat walk beside me to meeting.\"      CHAPTER III.  A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE OLDEST FAMILIES MEETS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM THE CITY.   Dick Lee had been more than half right about the village being a dangerous place for him, with such an unusual amount of clothing over his ordinary uniform.  The very dogs, every one of whom was an old acquaintance, barked at him on his way home that night; and, proud as were his ebony father and mother of the improvement in their son's appearance, they yielded to his earnest entreaties, first, that he might wear his present all the next day, and, second, that he might betake himself to the \"bay\" early in the morning, and so keep out of sight \"till he got used to it.\"  \"On'y, you jist mind wot yer about!\" said his mother, \"and see't you keep dem clo'es from gettin' wet. I jist can't 'foard to hab dem spiled right away.\"  The fault with Dab Kinzer's old suit, after all, had lain mainly in its size rather than its materials; for Mrs. Kinzer was too good a manager to be really stingy.  Dick succeeded in reaching the boat-landing without falling in with any one who seemed disposed to laugh at him; but there, right on the wharf, was a white boy of about his own age, and he felt a good deal like backing out.  \"Nebber seen him afore, either,\" said Dick to himself. \"Den I guess I ain't afeard ob him.\"  The stranger was a somewhat short and thick-set, but bright and active-looking boy, with a pair of very keen, greenish-gray eyes. But, after all, the first word he spoke to poor Dick was,--  \"Hullo, clothes! Where are you going with all that boy?\"  \"I knowed it, I knowed it!\" groaned Dick. But he answered as sharply as he knew how,--  \"I's goin' a-fishin'. Any ob youah business?\"--  \"Where'd you learn how to fish?\" the stranger asked, \"Down South? Didn't know they had any there.\"  \"Nebbah was down Souf,\" was the somewhat surly reply.  \"Father run away, did he?\"  \"He nebber was down dar, nudder.\"  \"Nor his father?\"  \"'Tain't no business ob yourn,\" said Dick, \"but we's allers lived right heah, on dis bay.\"  \"Guess not,\" said the white boy knowingly. Dick was right, nevertheless; for his people had been slaves among the very earliest Dutch settlers, and had never \"lived South\" at all. He was now busily getting one of the boats ready to shove off; but his white tormentor went at him again, with,--  \"Well, then, if you've lived round here as long as that, you must know everybody.\"  \"Reckon I do.\"  \"Are there any nice fellows around here? Any like me?\"  \"De nicest young gen'lman round dis bay,\" replied Dick, \"is Mr. Dab Kinzer. But he ain't like you. Not nuff to hurt him.\"  \"Dab Kinzer,\" exclaimed the stranger. \"Where'd he get his name?\"  \"In de bay, I 'spect,\" said Dick, as he shoved his boat off; \"caught 'im wid a hook.\"  \"Anyhow,\" said the strange boy to himself, \"that's probably the kind of fellow my father would wish me to associate with. Only it's likely he's very ignorant.\"  And he walked away towards the village, with the air of a man who had forgotten more than the rest of his race were ever likely to find out.  At all events, Dick Lee had managed to say a good word for his benefactor, little as he could guess what might be the consequences.  Meantime Dab Kinzer, when he went out from breakfast, had strolled away to the north fence, for a good look at the house which was thenceforth to be the home of his favorite sister. He had seen it before, every day since he could remember; but it seemed to have a fresh and almost mournful interest for him just now.  \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, as he leaned against the fence. \"Putting up ladders? Oh, yes, I see! That's old Tommy McGrew, the house-painter. Well, Ham's house needs a new coat as badly as I did. Sure it'll fit too. Only it ain't used to it, any more'n I am.\"  \"Dabney!\"  It was his mother's voice, and Dab felt like \"minding\" very promptly that morning.  \"Dabney, my boy, come here to the gate.\"  \"Ham Morris is having his house painted,\" he remarked, as he walked towards his mother.  \"Is he?\" she said. \"We'll go and see about it.\"  The gate between the two \"side-yards\" had been there from time immemorial, and-they walked right through. As they drew nearer the Morris house, however, Dabney discovered that carpenters as well as painters were plying their trade in and about the old homestead. There were window-sashes piled here, and blinds there; a new door or so, ready for use, a great stack of bundles of shingles, some barrels of lime, and a heap of sand. Whichever way Dab looked, there were visible signs of an approaching renovation.  \"Going to fix it all over,\" he remarked.  \"Yes,\" replied his mother: \"it'll be as good as new. It was well built, and will bear mending. I couldn't say that of some of the shackling things they've been putting up around the village.\"  When they entered the house it became more and more evident that the \"shabby\" days of the Morris mansion were numbered. There were men at work in almost every room.  Ham's wedding-trip would surely give plenty of time, at that rate, for an immense amount of \"mending;\" and his house would be, as the widow had promised, \"all ready for him on his return.\"  There was nothing wonderful to Dabney in the idea of his mother going about and inspecting work, and finding fault, and giving directions. He had never seen her do any thing else, and he had the greatest confidence in her knowledge and ability. He noticed too, before they left the place, that the customary farm-work was going ahead with even more regularity and energy than if the owner himself had been present.  \"Ham's farm'll look something like ours, one of these days,\" he said, \"if things go on at this rate.\"  \"I mean it shall,\" replied his mother, a little sharply. \"Now go and get out the ponies, and we'll do the rest of our errands.\"  Dab started for the barn at a half trot; for, if there was one thing he liked better than another, it was to have the reins in his hands and that pair of ponies before him. Time had been when Mrs. Kinzer did her own driving, and only permitted Dab to \"hold the horses\" while she made her calls, business or otherwise; but that day had been safely put away among Dab's unpleasant memories for a good while.  It was but a few minutes before the neat buggy held the widow and her son, and the ponies were taking them briskly down the road towards the village.  It they had only known it, at that very moment Ham Morris and his blooming bride were setting out for a drive, at the fashionable watering-place where they had made their first stop in their wedding-tour.  \"Ham,\" said Miranda, \"it seems to me as if we were a thousand miles from home.\"  \"We shall be a good deal farther before we get any nearer,\" said Ham.  \"But I wonder what they are doing there, this morning,--mother, and the girls, and dear little Dabney.\"  \"Little Dabney!\" exclaimed Ham, with a queer sort of laugh on his face. \"Why, Miranda, do you think Dab is a baby yet?\"  \"No, not a baby, but\"--  \"Well, he's a boy, that's a fact; but he'll be as tall as I am in three years.\"  \"Will he? Do you think so? But will he ever get fat?\"  \"Not till after he gets his full length,\" said Ham. \"We must have him at our house a good deal, after we get home, and feed him up. I've taken a liking to Dab.\"  \"Feed him up!\" said Miranda. \"Do you think we starve him?\"  \"No, I suppose not; but how many meals a day does he get?\"  \"Three, of course, like the rest of us; and he never misses one of them.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Ham: \"I shouldn't suppose he would. I never miss a meal, myself, if I can help it. But don't you think three meals a day is rather short allowance for a boy like Dab?\"  Miranda thought a moment, but then she answered positively,--  \"No, I don't. Not if he does as well at each one of them as Dabney is sure to.\"  \"Well,\" said Ham, \"that was in his old clothes, that were too tight for him. Now he's got a good loose fit, with plenty of room, you don't know how much more he may need. No, Miranda, I'm going to have an eye on Dab.\"  \"You're a dear good fellow, anyway,\" said Miranda, with one of her very best smiles, \"and I hope mother'll have the house all ready for us when we get back.\"  \"She will,\" replied Ham, after a moment spent in somewhat thoughtful silence. \"Do you know, Miranda, I shall hardly be easy about that till I see what she's done with it? It was in a dreadfully baggy condition.\"      CHAPTER IV.  TWO BOYS, ONE PIG, AND AN UNFORTUNATE RAILWAY-TRAIN.   \"That's him!\"  Dab was standing by his ponies, in front of a store in the village."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10340"],["title","Dab Kinzer: A Story of a Growing Boy (#3)"],["body"," mother was making some purchases in the store, and Dab was thinking how the Morris house would look when it was finished; and it was at him the old farmer was pointing in answer to a question which had just been asked him.  The questioner was the sharp-eyed boy who had bothered poor Dick Lee that morning, and he was now evidently making a sort of \"study\" of Dab Kinzer.  At that moment, however, a young lady--quite young--came tripping along the sidewalk, and was stopped by Dabney, with,--  \"There, Jenny Walters! If I didn't forget my label!\"  \"Why, Dabney! Is that you? How you startled me! Forgot your label?\"  \"Yes,\" said Dab; \"I'm in another new suit today; and I meant to have a label on the collar, with my name on it. You'd have known me then.\"  \"But I know you now,\" exclaimed Jenny. \"Why, I saw you yesterday.\"  \"Yes, and I told you it was me. Can you read, Jenny?\"  \"Why, what a question!\"  \"Because, if you can't, it won't do me any good to wear a label.\"  \"Dabney Kinzer!\" exclaimed Jenny, \"there's an other thing you ought to get.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Some good manners,\" said the little lady snappishly. \"Think of your stopping me in the street to tell me I can't read!\"  \"Then you mustn't forget me so quick,\" said Dab. \"If you meet my old clothes anywhere you must call them Dick Lee. They've had a change of name.\"  \"So he's in them, is he? I don't doubt they look better than they ever did before.\"  Jenny walked away at once, at the end of that remark, holding her head pretty high, and leaving her old playmate feeling as if he had had a little the worst of it. That was often the way with people who stopped to talk with Jenny Walters, and she was not as much of a favorite as she otherwise might have been.  Dabney looked after her with his mouth puckered into shape for a whistle; but she had hardly disappeared before he found himself confronted by the strange young gentleman.  \"Is your name Dabney Kinzer?\"  \"Yes, I believe so.\"  \"Well, I'm Mr. Ford Foster, from New York.\"  \"Come over here to buy goods?\" suggested Dabney. \"Or to get something to eat?\"  Ford Foster was apparently of about Dab's age, but a full head less in height, so that there was more point in the question than there seemed to be; but he treated it as not worthy of notice, and asked,--  \"Do you know of a house to let anywhere about here?\"  \"House to let?\" suddenly exclaimed the voice of Mrs. Kinzer, behind him, much to Dab's surprise. \"Are you asking about a house? Whom for?\"  Ford Foster had been quite ready to \"chaff\" Dick Lee, and he would not have hesitated about trying a like experiment upon Mr. Dabney Kinzer; but he knew enough to speak respectfully to the portly and business-like lady before him now.  \"Yes, madam,\" he said, with a ceremonious bow: \"I wish to report to my father that I have found an acceptable house in this vicinity.\"  \"You do!\"  Mrs. Kinzer was reading the young gentleman through and through, as she spoke; but she followed her exclamation with a dozen questions, all of which he answered with a good deal of clearness and intelligence. She wound up at last, with,--  \"Go right home, then, and tell your father the only good house to let in this neighborhood will be ready for him next week. I'll show it to him when he comes, but he'd better see me at once. Dabney, jump into the buggy. I'm in a hurry.\"  The ponies were in motion, up the street, before Ford Foster quite recovered from the shock of being told to \"go right home.\"  \"A very remarkable woman,\" he muttered, as he turned away, \"and she did not tell me a word about the house, after all. I must make some more inquiries. The boy is actually well dressed, for a place like this.\"  \"Mother,\" said Dabney, as they drove along, \"you wouldn't let 'em have Ham's house, would you?\"  \"No, indeed. But I don't mean to have our own stand empty.\"  With that reply a great deal of light broke in upon Dab's mind.  \"That's it, is it?\" he said to himself, as he touched up the ponies. \"Well, there'll be room enough for all of us there, and no mistake. But what'll Ham say?\"  That was a question which he could safely leave to the very responsible lady beside him; and she found \"errands\" enough for him, during the remainder of that forenoon, to keep him from worrying his mind about any thing else.  As for Ford Foster, it was not until late on the following day that he completed all his \"inquiries\" to his satisfaction. He took the afternoon train for the city, almost convinced that, much as he undoubtedly knew before he came, he had actually acquired a good deal more knowledge which might be of some value.  Ford was almost the only passenger in the car he had selected. Trains going towards the city were apt to be thinly peopled at that time of day; but the empty cars had to be taken along all the same, for the benefit of the crowds who would be coming out later in the afternoon and in the evening. The railway-company would have made more money with full loads both ways, but it was well they did not have a full load on that precise train.  Ford had turned over the seat in front of him, and stretched himself out with his feet on it. It was almost like lying down, for a boy of his length; and it was the very best position he could possibly have taken if he had known what was coming.  Known what was coming?  Yes: there was a pig coming.  That was all; but it was quite enough, considering what that pig was about to do. He was going where he chose, just then; and not only had he chosen to walk upon the railroad-track, but he had also made up his mind not to turn out for that locomotive and its train of cars.  He saw it, of course, for he was looking straight at it; and the engineer saw him, but it would have been well for the pig if he had been discovered a few seconds earlier.  \"What a whistle!\" exclaimed Ford Foster at that moment. \"It sounds more like the squeal of an iron pig than any thing else. I\"--  But at that instant there came to him a great jolt and a shock; and Ford found himself tumbled all in a heap, on the seat where his feet had been. Then came bounce after bounce, and the sound of breaking glass, and then a crash.  \"Off the track,\" shouted Ford, as he sprang to his feet. \"I wouldn't have missed it for any thing. I do hope, though, there hasn't anybody been killed.\"  In the tremendous excitement of the moment he could hardly have told how he got out of that car; but it did not seem ten seconds before he was standing beside the engineer and conductor of the train, looking at the battered engine, as it lay upon its side in a deep ditch. The baggage-car, just behind it, was broken all to pieces, but the passenger-cars did not seem to have suffered very much; and nobody was badly hurt, as the engineer and fireman had jumped off in time.  There had been very little left of the pig; but the conductor and the rest seemed much disposed to say unkind things about him, and about his owner, and about all the other pigs they could think of.  \"This train'll never get in on time,\" said Ford to the conductor, a little later. \"How'll I get to the city?\"  The railway man was not in the best of humors; and he answered, a little groutily, \"Well, young man, I don't suppose the city could get along without you over night. The junction with the main road is only two miles ahead, and if you're a good walker you may catch a train there.\"  Some of the other passengers, none of whom were much more than \"badly shaken up,\" or down, had made the same discovery; and in a few minutes more there was a long, straggling procession of uncomfortable people, marching by the side of the railway-track, in the hot sun. They were nearly all of them making unkind remarks about pigs, and the faculty they had of not getting out of the way.  The conductor was right, however; and nearly all of them managed to walk the two miles to the junction in time to go in on the other train.  Ford Foster was among the first to arrive, and he was likely to reach home in season, in spite of the pig and his outrageous conduct.  As for his danger, he had hardly thought of that; and he again and again declared to himself that he would not have missed so important an adventure for any thing he could think of. It almost sounded once or twice as if he took to himself no small amount of personal credit, not to say glory, for having been in so remarkable an accident, and come out of it so well.  Ford's return, when he should make it, was to take him to a great, pompous, stylish, crowded \"up-town boarding-house,\" in one of the fashionable streets of the great city. There was no wonder at all that wise people should wish to get out of such a place in such hot weather. Still it was the sort of home Ford Foster had been acquainted with all his life; and it was partly owing to that, that he had become so prematurely \"knowing.\"  He knew too much, in fact, and was only too well aware of it. He had filled his head with an unlimited stock of boarding-house information, as well as with a firm persuasion that there was little more to be had,--unless, indeed, it might be scraps of such outside knowledge as he had now been picking up over on Long Island.  In one of the large \"parlor-chambers\" of the boarding-house, at about eight o'clock that evening, a middle-aged gentleman and lady, with a fair, sweet-faced girl of about nineteen, were sitting near an open window, very much as if they were waiting for somebody. Such a kind, motherly lady! She was one of those whom no one can help liking, after seeing her smile once, or hearing her speak.  Ford Foster himself could not have put in words what he thought about his mother. And yet he had no difficulty whatever in expressing his respect for his father, or his unbounded admiration for his pretty sister Annie.  \"O husband!\" exclaimed Mrs. Foster, \"are you sure none of them were injured?\"  \"So the telegraphic report said; not a bone broken of anybody, but the pig that got in the way.\"  \"How I wish he would come!\""]]]
