The unhappy child walked on in silence, twisting a lock of her front hair, and looking up at the sky. A few soft snow-flakes were dropping out of the clouds. Every flake seemed to fall on her heart. Winter was coming. It was a gray, miserable world, and she was left out in the cold. She remembered she had been happy once, but that was ages ago. It wasn't likely she should ever smile again; and as for laughter, she knew that was over with her forever. Susy and Prudy were at home, making book-marks and cologne mats; _they_ could smile, for they hadn't run away.  \"I shouldn't think my mamma'd care if I went in at the back door,\" thought Dotty, meekly. \"If she locks me out, I can lie down on the steps and freeze.\"  But the question was, how to get away from Mandoline, who had her in charge like a sharp-eyed sheriff.  \"That's the street I turn to go to my house--isn't it, Lina?\" asked she, quickly.  \"I shan't tell you, Dotty Dimple. Why do you ask?\"  \"'Cause I'm going home. I'm sick. Good by.\"  \"But you musn't go a step, Dotty Dimple.\"  \"Yes, I shall; you're not my mamma, Lina Rosenberg; you mustn't tell me what to do.\"  \"Well, I'm going everywhere you go, Dotty, but I shan't say whether it's the way to your house, or the way to Boston; and _you_ don't know.\"  Dotty was not to be so easily baffled.  \"I don't know myself, Lina Rosenberg, but if you're so mean as not to tell, I can ask somebody else that _will_ tell--don't you see?\"  This was a difficulty which Lina had not provided for. She was very sorry Dotty had come out \"to breathe.\"  Very soon they overtook a lady, who pointed out the right street to Dotty; and it was in an opposite direction from the one she was taking.  \"Now I've found out, Miss Rosenberg, and you can't help yourself.\"  \"Well, I shall go with you, Dotty, just the same. I shall go right up to your house, and tell your mother you've run away _again_\"  It was very disagreeable to Miss Dimple to be pursued in this way; but she put on an air of defiance.  \"I shouldn't think you'd want to go where you wasn't wanted, Miss Rosenberg.\"  Lina had never intended to do such a thing; she had not courage enough.  \"O, dear! what shall I do to make you go back with me? My mother'll scold me awfully for letting you get away.\"  \"Well, there; you've got the dreadfulest mother, Lina, and I'm real sorry; but it's no use to tease me; I wouldn't go back, not if you should cut me up into little pieces as big as a cent.\"  Lina was ready to fall upon her knees, right on the pavement. She offered Dotty paper dolls enough to people a colony; but Miss Dimple was as firm as a rock, now her face was once set towards home. Lina turned on her heel, and slowly walked away. Dotty called after her:--  \"There, Lina, now you've told an awful story! You said you'd go to my house, and tell my mother I'd run away again; and now you don't dare go; so you've told an awful wicked story.\"  With this parting thrust at her tormentor, Dotty turned again to the misery of her own thoughts. Her home was already in sight; but the uncertainty as to her reception there made her little feet falter in their course. Her head sank lower and lower, till her chin snuggled into the hollow of her neck, and her eyes peered out keenly from under her hat, to make sure no one was watching. There was a door-yard on one side of the house. She touched the gate-latch as gently as if it had been a loaded gun, and crept noiselessly along to the side door. Here she paused. Her heart throbbed loudly; but, in spite of that, she could hear Norah walking about, and rattling the covers of the stove, as she put in coal.  Dotty's courage failed. What if Norah should make believe she didn't know her, and shut the door in her face?  \"I can't see Norah, and hear her say, 'What strange little girl is this? It _looks_ like our Alice; but it can't be any such a child!' No, I can't see anybody. I've finished my visit; I have a right to come home; but p'rhaps they won't think so. I feel's if I wasn't half so good as tea-grounds, or coffee-grounds, or potato-skins,\" continued she, with a pang of despair. \"I know what I'll do; I'll go down cellar; that's where the rats stay; and if I _am_ bad, I hope I'm as good as a rat, for I don't bite.\"  One of the cellar windows had been left out in order to admit coal. Through this window crept Dotty, regardless of her white stockings and crimson dress. When she had fairly got her head through the opening, and was no longer afraid of being seen, she breathed more freely.  \"Here I am! Not a bit of me out. But I must go on my tipsy-toes, or they'll hear me, and think it's a _buggler_\"  There was quite a steep hill to walk over, and she found it anything but a path of roses. Once or twice she stumbled and fell upon her hands and knees.  \"Seems to me,\" said she, drawing out her foot, which had sunk above the ankle in coal,--\"seems to me I have as many feet as a caterpillar.\"  But she kept on, down the Hill of Difficulty, till she reached solid ground. It was not a very cheerful apartment, that is certain. The light had much difficulty in getting in at the little windows, and when it did fight its way through it was not good for much; it was a gloomy light, and looked as if it had had a hard time.  Dotty went up to the furnace for comfort. It was a tall, black thing, doing its best to give warmth and cheer to the rooms up stairs, but it was of no use to the cellar. It was like some brilliant people, who shine in society, but are dull and stupid at home. Dotty opened the furnace door, and tried to warm her cold fingers.  \"Why, my hands are as black as a _sip_,\" sighed she; as if she could have expected anything else.  There did not seem to be one ray of hope in her little dark soul. She had no tears to shed,--she seldom had,--but when she was in trouble, she was always in the lowest depths.  \"Pretty well for me to make believe I was a thief, and was going to steal! 'Who is this strange little girl?' said he; 'it _looks_ like--'\"  She heard voices near the cellar door. What if Norah should come down after butter? Dotty was not prepared for that. She could not hide in the keg of lard, of course; and what _should_ she do?  \"My head is tipside up; I can't think.\" Then she began to wonder how long she could live down there, in case she was not discovered.  \"I s'pose I can climb up on the swing shelf, and sleep there nights. I can hide behind things in the daytime, and when I'm hungry I can eat out of the jars and boxes.\"  The sound of voices came down distinctly from the kitchen overhead. Dotty crouched behind an apple barrel, and listened. Grandma Read was talking to Mrs. Parlin, who seemed to be in another room.  \"Mary, my glasses _are_ gone this time,\" said she. \"If little Alice were only here, I should set her to hunting.\"  \"She don't know I'm in the house this minute,\" thought Dotty; \"no, _under_ the house. Dear me!\"  With that she walked softly up the stairs, and listened at the door-latch; for the sound of her grandmother's voice was encouraging, and Dotty, in her loneliness, longed to be near the dear people of the family, even if she could not see them.  \"Edward,\" said her mother,--what music there was in her voice!--\"if you are going after that dear child, you'd better take a shawl to wrap her in, for it is snowing fast. And be sure to tell her we love her dearly, every one of us, and don't believe she will ever run away again.\"  \"O, was her papa going after her? Did they love her, after all? Were they willing to keep her in the house?\"  Dotty opened the door before she knew it. \"O, mamma, mamma!\" cried she, rushing into her mother's arms.  \"Why, Dotty, you darling child, where did you come from?\" exclaimed Mrs. Parlin, in great surprise, kissing the little, dirty girl, and taking her right to her heart, in spite of the coal-dust.  \"If you'll let me stay at home,\" gasped Dotty, \"if you'll _let_ me stay at home, I'll live in the kitchen, and won't go near the table.\"  \"Where _did you_ come from?\" said Mr. Parlin, kissing a clean place on Dotty's black face, and laughing under his breath.  \"I came through the cellar window, papa.\"  \"Through the cellar window, child?\"  \"Yes, papa; I didn't s'pose you'd care!\"  \"Care! My dear, your mother is the one to care! Just look at your stockings!\"  \"There was coal there, thrown in,\" said Dotty, with a quivering lip; \"and I had to walk over it, and under it, and through it.\"  \"Was my little daughter afraid to come in by the door?\"  \"I didn't know's you wanted me, papa.  \"I thought you'd say, 'What strange child is this?'\"  Mr. Parlin, looking at the black streaks on Dotty's woeful face, found it very difficult to keep from laughing. \"A strange child' she appeared to be, certainly.  \"But I'd got my visit all finished up, ever and ever so long ago.\"  \"So you really chose to come back to us, my dear?\"  \"O, papa, you don't know! Did you think, did you s'pose--\"  Here Dotty broke down completely, and, seizing her father's shirt-bosom in both her grimy hands, she buried her face in it, and sprinkled it with tears of ink.  There was great surprise throughout the house when Dotty's arrival became known.  \"We didn't know how to live without you any longer,\" said Prudy; \"and tomorrow Thanksgiving Day.\"  \"But I never should have come up,\" said Dotty, \"if I hadn't heard mamma talk about loving me just the same; I never _could_ have come up.\"  \"Excuse me for smiling,\" said Prudy; \"but you look as if you had fallen into the inkstand. It is _so_ funny!\"  Dotty was not at all amused herself; but after she was dressed in clean clothes, she felt very happy, and enjoyed her supper remarkably well. The thought that they \"didn't know how to live without her\" gave a relish to every mouthful.

Why, we must be running sixty miles an hour!\"  \"If we are not we are making pretty close to it,\" came from a third boy of the party in the parlor car. \"I think the engineer is trying to make up some of the time we lost at the last stop.\"  \"That must be it, Dick,\" said Sam Rover. \"Gracious, how we are rocking!\" he added as the train rushed around a sharp curve and nearly threw him from his chair.  \"I hope we get to Ashton on time,\" remarked Tom Rover. \"I want to take a look around the grounds before it gets dark.\"  \"That's Tom, wanting to see it all before he sleeps!\" cried Sam Rover with a grin. \"You look out, Tom, that you don't get into disgrace the first thing, as you did when we went to Putnam Hall Don't you remember that giant firecracker, and how Josiah Crabtree locked you up in a cell for setting it off?\"  \"Ugh! Will I ever forget it!\" groaned Tom, making a wry face. \"But I got the best of old Crabtree, didn't I?\" he continued, his face brightening.  \"Wonder if we'll make as many friends at college as we did at Putnam Hall,\" remarked Dick Rover. \"Those were jolly times and no mistake! Think of the feasts, and the hazings, and the baseball and football, and the rackets with the Pornell students, and all that!\"  \"Speaking of hazing, I heard that some of the hazing at the college we're bound for is fierce,\" came from Sam Rover.  \"Well, we'll have to stand for what comes, Sam,\" answered his big brother. \"No crying quit' here.\"  \"Right you are, Dick,\" said Tom, \"At the same time if--Great Caesar's ghost, what's up now!\"  As Tom uttered the last words a shrill whistle from the locomotive pierced the air. Then came the sudden gripping of the air brakes on the car wheels, and the express came to a stop with a shock that pitched all the passengers from their seats. Tom and Sam went sprawling in a heap in the aisle and Dick came down on top of them.  \"Hi, get off of me!\" spluttered Sam, who was underneath.  \"What's the matter? Have we run into another train?\" asked Tom as he pushed Dick to one side and arose.  \"I don't know,\" answered the older brother. \"Something is wrong, that's certain.\"  \"Are you hurt, Sam?\" asked Tom as he helped the youngest Rover to his feet.  \"No--not much,\" was the panting reply. \"Say, we stopped in a hurry all right, didn't we?\"  With the shock had come loud cries from the other people in the car, and it was found that one young lady had fainted. Everybody wanted to know what was the matter, but nobody could answer the question. The colored porter ran to the platform and opened the vestibule door. Tom followed the man and so did Sam and Dick.  \"Freight train ahead, off the track,\" announced Tom. \"We ran into the last car.\"  \"Let us go up front and see how bad it is,\" returned Dick. \"Maybe this will tie us up here for hours.\"  \"Oh, I hope not,\" cried Sam. \"I want to get to the college just as soon as possible. I'm dying to know what it's like.\"  \"We can be thankful we were not hurt, Sam,\" said his older brother. \"If our engineer hadn't stopped the train as he did we might have had a fearful smashup.\"  \"I know it,\" answered Sam soberly, and then the boys walked forward to learn the full extent of the damage done and what prospects there were of continuing their journey.  To my old readers the lads just mentioned will need no special introduction, but for the benefit of those who have not read the previous volumes in this \"Rover Boys Series\" let me state that the brothers were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom coming next and Sam the youngest. They were the sons of one Anderson Rover, a rich widower, and when at home lived with their father and an aunt and an uncle on a beautiful farm called Valley Brook.  From the farm, and while their father was in Africa, the boys had been sent by their Uncle Randolph to school, as related in the first book of the series, called \"The Rover Boys at School.\" At this place, called Putnam Hall, they made many friends and also a few enemies and had \"the time of their lives,\" as Tom often expressed it.  A term at school had been followed by a short trip on the ocean, and then the boys, in company with their uncle, went to the jungles of Africa to rescue Mr. Rover, who was a captive of a savage tribe of natives. After that came trips out West, and to the Great Lakes, and to the mountains, and, returning to school, the lads went into camp with the other cadets. Then they took another long trip on land and sea and led a Crusoe-like life on an island of the Pacific Ocean.  \"I think we'd better settle down now,\" said Dick on returning home from being cast away, but this was not to be. They took a house-boat trip down the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers, had a number of adventures on the plains and then found themselves in southern waters, where they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.  They returned to the farm and to Putnam Hall, and for a time matters went along quietly. On account of attending to some business for his father, Dick had fallen somewhat behind in his studies, and Tom and Sam did their best to catch up to him, and, as a consequence, all three of the youths graduated from Putnam Hall at the same time.  \"And now for college!\" Sam had said, and all were anxious to know where their parent intended to send them next But instead of settling this question Mr. Rover came forward with a proposition that was as novel as it was inviting. This was nothing less than to visit a spot in the West Indies, known as Treasure Isle, and made a hunt for a large treasure secreted there during a rebellion in one of the Central American countries.  \"A treasure hunt! Just the thing!\" Dick had said, and his brothers agreed with him. The lads were filled with excitement over the prospect, and for the time being all thoughts of going to college were thrust aside.  From Mr. Rover it was learned that the treasure belonged to the estate of a Mr. Stanhope, who had died some years before. Mr. Stanhope's widow was well known to the Rover boys, and Dick thought that Dora Stanhope, the daughter, was the finest girl in the whole world. There was also another relative, a Mrs. Laning--the late Mr. Stanhope's sister--who was to share in the estate, and she had two daughters, Grace and Nellie, two young ladies who were especial favorites with Sam and Tom.  \"Oh, we've got to find that treasure,\" said Tom. \"Think of what it means to the Stanhopes and the Lanings.\"  \"They'll be rich--and they deserve to be,\" answered his brother Sam. It may be added here that the Rovers were wealthy, so they did not begrudge the treasure to others.  A steam yacht was chartered and a party was made up, consisting of the Rovers, several of the boys' school chums, Mrs. Stanhope and Dora and Mrs. Laning and Grace and Nellie. The steam yacht carried a fine crew and also an old tar called Bahama Bill, who knew the exact location of the treasure.  Before sailing it was learned that some rivals were also after the treasure. One of these was a sharper named Sid Merrick, who had on several occasions tried to get the best of the Rovers and failed. With Merrick was Tad Sobber, his nephew, a youth who at Putnam Hall had been a bitter foe to Dick, Tom and Sam. Sobber had sent the Rovers a box containing a live poisonous snake, but the snake got away and bit another pupil. This lad knew all about the sending of the reptile and he exposed Tad Sobber, and the latter, growing alarmed, ran away from the school.  The search for the treasure proved a long one, and Sid Merrick and Tad Sobber did all in their power to keep the wealth from falling into the hands of the Rovers and their friends. But the Rovers won out in the quest and sailed away with the treasure on board the steam yacht. The vessel of their enemies followed them, but a hurricane came up and the other ship was lost with nearly all on board.  \"Well, that's the end of Sid Merrick and Tad Sobber,\" said Dick when he heard this news. \"If they are at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean they can't bother us any more.\" But Dick was mistaken in his surmise. It was true that Sid Merrick had been drowned, but Tad Sobber was alive, having been rescued by a schooner bound for London, and he was now on his way back to the United States, more bitter than ever against the Rovers, and with a"]]]
