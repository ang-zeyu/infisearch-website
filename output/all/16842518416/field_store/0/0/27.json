We can't go out and fight them in Locker's Lane; we're too small, and they know it.  Young Noaks would never have dared to act as he did after they'd knocked our snow man down if Mason had been here. They think now they're going to ride rough-shod over us; but they aren't, and we must show them we aren't going to be trampled on.\"  \"So we will,\" cried Jack Vance excitedly, \"and that jolly quick!\"  \"But how?\"  There was a moment's pause.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Jack sadly, and so the meeting terminated.  The fact of the insult, which had been put upon them by the destruction of their snow man, remaining unavenged, caused a sense of gloom to rest upon the Birchites, as though they already felt themselves suffering beneath the yoke of the conquering Philistines.  Even the bedroom feuds were forgotten: night after night the \"House of Lords\" left the \"Dogs' Home\" in undisturbed tranquillity, and the occupants of the \"Main-top\" retired to rest without even putting a washstand against their door.  One thought occupied the minds of all, and even Mugford, when asked on one occasion by Mr. Blake who were the conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot, answered absent-mindedly, \"The Philistines!\"  \"Look here, you two,\" said Diggory one evening, as he scrambled into bed, \"we three must think of some way of paying those fellows out for knocking down our snow man.  It would be splendid if we could say that the Triple Alliance had done it, and without telling any one beforehand.\"  \"So we will,\" answered Jack Vance; \"that is if you'll think of the plan. I'm not able to make one, and I'm jolly sure Mugford can't.\"  The speaker turned over and went to sleep; but after what seemed half the night had passed, he was suddenly aroused by several violent tugs at his bed-clothes.  Thinking it nothing less than a midnight raid, Jack sprang up and grasped his pillow.  \"No, no, it's not that,\" said Diggory, \"but I wanted to help you; I've got an idea.\"  \"W--what about?\" asked the other, in a sleepy voice.  \"Why, how we can pay out the Philistines!\"  \"Oh, bother the Philistines!\" grumbled Jack, and promptly returned to the land of dreams.  \"I wonder where those fellows Vance and Trevanock are?\" said Acton the following afternoon, as the boys were picking up for a game at prisoner's base.  \"And there's that dummy of a Mugford--where's he sneaked off to? he never will play games if he can possibly help it.\"  They set to work, and at the end of about twenty minutes were engaged in a most exciting rally.  Acton had started out to rescue one of the prisoners, while Shaw had rushed forth to capture Acton.  Morris left the base with similar designs on Shaw, and every one, with the exception of the den-keepers, seemed suddenly seized with an irresistible desire to do something.  The playground was full of boys rushing and dodging all over the place, when suddenly everybody stood still and listened. Some one was pounding with his clinched fist at the door opening into Locker's Lane, and at the same time Jack Vance was heard shouting, \"Let us in quick, or the Philistines'll have us!\"  Acton ran to fetch the key, and the next moment the three members of the Triple Alliance dashed through the open door, which was hastily secured behind them, while a shout of baffled rage some little distance down the road showed that they had only narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy.  The pursuit, however, was evidently abandoned, and Morris, climbing on the roof of the shed, saw young Noaks and Hogson slowly retreating round the corner of the road.  The three friends certainly presented a striking appearance.  Mugford's nose was bleeding, Jack Vance's collar seemed to have been nearly torn off his neck, while Diggory's cap was in his hand, and his hair in a state of wild disorder.  Their faces, flushed with running, were radiant with a look of triumph, while all three, the unfortunate Mugford included, leaned up against the wall, and laughed until the tears ran down their cheeks.  \"What have you fellows been up to?\" cried Acton; \"why don't you tell us?\"  \"Oh my!\" gasped Diggory, \"we've taken a fine rise out of the Philistines; they can't say we're not quits with them now!\" and he went off into a fresh fit of merriment.  Shaw and Morris seized hold of Jack Vance, and at length succeeded in shaking him into a sufficient state of sobriety to be able to answer their questions.  \"Oh dear,\" he said faintly, \"I never laughed so much in my life before! Diggory ought to tell you, because he planned it all.  We went very quietly down to Horace House, and found the double doors were shut. You know just what they're like, how the wall curves in a bit, and there's a scraper close to the gate-post, on either side, about a foot from the ground.  We'd got an old play-box cord with us, and we tied it to each of the scrapers.  The doors have a sort of iron ring for a handle, and through this we stuck a broken cricket-stump, and Mug and I held the two ends so that you couldn't possibly lift the latch on the inside.  Then--but you go on, Diggy.\"  \"Well, then,\" continued the other, \"I scrambled on to these two chaps' shoulders, and looked over the top of the door.  We could hear some of the Philistines knocking about on the gravel, and I saw there were about half a dozen of them playing footer with a tennis-ball.  I shouted out, 'Hullo!  Good-afternoon!'  They all stood still in a moment, and young Noaks cried, 'Why, it's a Birchite!--What do you want here, you young dog?'  I couldn't think of anything else to say, so I said, 'I want to know if this is the bear-pit or the monkey-house.'  My eye, you should have seen them!  I dropped down in a trice, and they all rushed to the doors; but they couldn't lift the latch, because Mug and Jack were holding fast to the stump.  We waited a moment, and then let go and ran for it.  You may judge what happened next.  It's a regular sea of mud outside those gates.  They all came rushing out together, and I saw Noaks and Hogson go head first over the rope, and two or three others fall flat on the top of them.  It was a sight, I can tell you!\"  \"Yes, but that wasn't all,\" interrupted Jack Vance.  \"Bernard, one of their big chaps, hopped over the rest and came after us.  We ran for all we were worth, but he collared me.  Mugford went for him, and hung on to his coat like a young bull-terrier, and got a smack on the nose; and just then Diggory turned, and came prancing back, and ran his head into the beggar's stomach, and that doubled him up, and so we all got away.  But,\" concluded the speaker, turning towards his wounded comrade, \"I never thought old Mug had so much grit in him before; he stuck to it like a Briton!\"  A demonstration of the most genuine enthusiasm followed this warlike speech.  Acton folded Diggory to his breast in a loving embrace, Shaw and Morris stuffed the door-key down Mugford's back, while the remainder of the company executed a war-dance round Jack Vance.  \"My eye,\" cried the dux, \"won't the Philistines be wild! Fancy upsetting them in the mud, and knocking Bernard's wind out! They won't be in a hurry to meddle with us again.  Well done, Diggy!\"  \"It wasn't I alone,\" said the author of the enterprise; \"we did it between us--the Triple Alliance.\"  \"Then three cheers for the Triple Alliance!\" cried Acton.  The company shouted themselves hoarse, for every one felt that the honour of The Birches had been retrieved, and that the day was still far distant when they would be crushed beneath the iron heel of young Noaks, or be exposed as an unresisting prey to the ravages of the wild hordes of Horace House.    CHAPTER IV.   THE SUPPER CLUB.  As this story is to be a history of the Triple Alliance, and not of The Birches, it will be necessary to pass over many things which happened at the preparatory school, in order that full justice may be done to the important parts played by our three friends in an epoch of strange and stirring events at Ronleigh College.  Diggory, by the daring exploit described in the previous chapter, won all hearts; and instead of being looked upon as a new boy, was regarded quite as an old and trusty comrade.  Acton displayed marked favour towards the Triple Alliance, and was even more friendly with Diggory and Jack Vance than with his room and class mates, Shaw and Morris.  The Philistines seemed, for the time being, paralyzed by the humiliation of their mud bath, and for many months there was a complete cessation from hostilities.  It was perhaps only natural that in time of peace a brave knight like Acton should turn his thoughts from war to love-making, and therefore I shall make no excuse for relating a little experience of his which must be introduced as a prelude to the account of the formation of the famous supper club.  At the very commencement of the summer term it was plain to everybody that something was wrong with the dux; he seemed to take no interest in the doings of his companions in the playground, and only once roused himself sufficiently to bang Cross with a leg-guard for bowling awful wides at cricket.  At length, one afternoon, Diggory and Jack Vance on entering the shed found him sitting on the carpenter's bench, with his chin resting in his hand, and a most ferocious expression on his face.  \"Hullo! what's up?\"  Acton stared blankly at the new-comers until the question had been repeated; then he sat up and straightened his back with the air of one who has made a great resolve.  \"I don't mind telling you two,\" he said. \"You know I've said before that I meant some day to propose to Miss Eleanor.  Well,\" he added, stabbing the bench with the gimlet, \"I'm going to do it.\"  \"I've saved five and ninepence,\" continued the speaker, \"to buy a ring with, but I can't make up my mind whether I'd better speak or write to her.  What do you think?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],["title","The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#6)"],["body","  \"I should say,\" answered Diggory, after a moment's thought, \"that the best thing would be to toss up for it.\"  \"All right; have you got a coin?\"  \"No, but I think I've got a brass button.  Yes, here it is.  Now, then, front you speak, and back you write.  There you are--it's a letter!\"  \"Well, now,\" said Acton, getting off the bench and sticking his hands deep in his trousers pockets, \"what had I better say?  I shall be fifteen in August; I thought I'd tell her my age, and say I didn't mind waiting.\"  \"I believe it's the girl who always says that,\" answered Jack Vance, kicking a bit of wood into a corner.  \"Then, again, I don't know how to begin.  Would you say 'Dear Miss Eleanor,' or 'Dear Miss Welsby'? I think 'Dear Eleanor' sounds rather cheeky.\"  \"I'll tell you what I should do,\" answered Diggory, who seemed to have a great idea of letting the fates decide these matters: \"I should write 'em all three on slips of paper and then draw one.\"  \"Well, I'm going to write the letter in 'prep' this evening, and let her have it to-morrow.  Did you notice I gave her a flower this morning, and she stuck it in her dress?\"  \"Yes; but fellows are often doing that,\" answered Jack Vance, \"and she always wears them, either in her dress or stuck up somehow under her brooch.\"  \"Oh, but this was a white rose, and a white rose means something, though I don't know what.  At all events, she'll have the letter to-morrow, and I'll tell you fellows when I give it her, only of course you mustn't breathe a word to any one else.\"  \"All right: we won't,\" answered Diggory, \"except to old Mugford, because he's one of the Alliance, and we've sworn not to have any secrets from each other, and he won't split.\"  That evening the Triple Alliance lay awake until a late hour discussing the situation.  Mugford's opening comment was certainly worth recording,--  \"I hope she'll accept him.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Why, because if she does, I should think old Welsby'll give us a half-holiday.\"  It was evident at breakfast, to those who were in the know, that Acton was prepared for the venture.  He was wearing a clean collar and new necktie, and ate only four pieces of bread and butter, besides his bacon.  \"He's shown me the letter,\" whispered Diggory to Jack Vance; \"only I promised I wouldn't say what was in it, but it ends up with a piece of poetry as long as this table!\"  After morning school was the time agreed upon for the dux to cast the die which was to decide his future; and as soon as the classes were dismissed, Jack Vance and Diggory met him by appointment in one corner of the garden.  \"I've done it,\" he said, looking awfully solemn.  \"She was in the hall, and I gave it to her as I came out.  I say, how many _t's_ are there in 'attachment'?\"  Jack Vance thought one, Diggory said two; and the company then relapsed into silence, and stood with gloomy looks upon their faces, as though they were waiting to take part in a funeral procession.  At length a voice from the house was heard calling, \"Fred--Fred Acton!\" The dux turned a trifle pale, but pulling himself together, marched off with a firm step to learn his fate.  \"She called him Fred,\" murmured Diggory; \"that sounds hopeful.\"  \"Oh, that's nothing,\" answered Jack Vance; \"Miss Eleanor always calls fellows by their Christian names.  There's one thing,\" he added, after a few moments' thought--\"if she'd cut up rough over the letter, she might have called him Mr. Acton.  Hullo, here he comes!\"  As he spoke Acton emerged from the house, and came down the path towards them; his straw hat was tilted forward over his eyes, and his cheeks were glowing like the red glass of a dark-room lamp.  He sauntered along, kicking up the gravel with the toe of his boot.  \"Well, what happened?\" inquired Jack Vance.  No answer.  \"What's the matter ?\" cried Diggory; \"what did she say?\"  \"Why, this!\" answered the other, in a voice trembling with suppressed emotion: \"she said I was a silly boy, and--and--_gave me a lump of cake!_\"  If any one else had done it, the probability is Acton would have slain them on the spot.  Diggory opened his eyes and mouth wide, and then exploded with laughter.  \"Oh my!\" he gasped, \"I shall die, I know I shall!  Ha, ha, ha!\"  Acton eyed him for a moment with a look of indignant astonishment; then he began to smile, Jack Vance commenced to chuckle, and very soon all three were laughing in concert.  \"Well, I think it's rather unfeeling of you fellows,\" said the rejected suitor; \"I can tell you I'm jolly cut up about it.\"  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" answered Diggory, \"but I couldn't help laughing. Cheer up; why, think, you won't have to get the ring now, so you can do what you like with that five and ninepence you saved.  Why, it's worth being refused to have five and ninepence to spend in grub!\"  \"Ah, Diggy !\" said the other, shaking his head in a mournful manner, \"wait till you're as old as I am: when you're close on fifteen you'll think differently about love and all that sort of thing.\"  As has already been hinted, it was the failure of this attempt on the part of the dux to win the heart and hand of Miss Eleanor that indirectly brought about the formation of the famous supper club. About a week after the events happened which have just been described, Acton invited the Triple Alliance to meet the \"House of Lords\" in the work-shed, to discuss an important scheme which he said had been in his mind for some days past; and the door having been locked to exclude outsiders, he commenced to unfold his project as follows:--  \"I've been thinking that during the summer term, and while the weather's warm, our two rooms might form a supper club.  We'd hold it, say, once a week, when pocket-money is given out, and have a feed together; one time in your room, and the next in ours, after every one's gone to bed. You know I saved some money at the beginning of the term to buy an engagement ring with; but I don't want it now, so I'm going to spend the tin in grub, and if you like I'll stand the first feed.\"  There was a murmur expressive of approbation at this generous offer, mingled with sympathy for the unhappy circumstance which gave rise to it, and which was now an open secret.  \"Oh,\" said Shaw, \"that's a grand idea!  I know my brother Bob, who's at a big school at Lingmouth, told me that he and some other chaps formed a supper club and held it in his study.  It's by the sea, and they used to go out and catch shrimps; and they only had one old coffee-pot, that they used to boil over the gas; so they cooked the shrimps in it first, and made the coffee after.  One night they only had time to heat it up once, and so they boiled the shrimps in the coffee; and Bob says they didn't taste half bad, and that they always used to do it after, to save time.\"  \"Well, I propose that we have one,\" cried Morris.  The resolution was carried unanimously.  Acton was elected president, and by way of recognizing the mutual interest of the Triple Alliance, Jack Vance was appointed to act as secretary, and it was decided to hold the first banquet on the following night.  \"We can buy the grub to-morrow,\" said Acton; \"but there's one thing we ought to fetch to-day, and that is, I thought we might have, say, six bottles of ginger-beer.  Then each man must take his own up to bed with him this evening, and hide it away in his box or in one of his drawers.\"  This was accordingly done, and, as it happened, was the cause of the only disaster which attended the formation of the club.  For the first week in June the weather was unusually hot: a candle left all day in the \"Main-top\" was found drooping out of the perpendicular, and when the Triple Alliance retired to rest their bedroom felt like an oven. They were just dozing off to sleep, when all three were suddenly startled by a muffled bang somewhere close to them.  In an instant they were sitting up in bed, rubbing their eyes with one hand and grasping their pillows with the other.  \"Look out, they're coming!\" whispered Jack Vance; \"wasn't that something hit the door?\"  \"It sounded as if something fell on the floor,\" answered Diggory. \"I wonder if anything's rolled off either of the washstands.\"  Jack Vance reconnoitred the passage, while Diggory and Mugford examined the room; but nothing could be found to account for the disturbance.  \"It must have been the fellows in the 'Main-top.'  I expect they dropped a book or upset a chair.  Don't let's bother about it any more.\"  The following morning, however, the mystery was explained.  The boys were hastily putting on their clothes, when Mugford, who had just thrown aside a dirty collar, gave vent to an exclamation of dismay, which attracted the attention of his two companions.  \"Hullo! what's up?\"  \"Why, look here!  If this beastly bottle of ginger-beer hasn't gone and burst in the middle of my box!\"  The first meeting of the supper club was a great success.  How ever Acton and his noble friends had managed to smuggle upstairs, under their jackets, a pork-pie, a plum-cake, a bag of tarts, and a pound of biscuits, was a feat which, as Jack Vance remarked, \"beat conjuring.\"  Shortly after midnight the Triple Alliance wended their way to the \"House of Lords,\" where they found the three other members quite ready to commence operations.  The good things were spread out on the top of a chest of drawers, and the company ranged themselves round on the available chairs and two adjacent beds, and commenced to enjoy the repast.  \"Ah, well,\" sighed Acton, with his mouth full of pork-pie, \"I'm rather glad for some things that I didn't get engaged.  It must be rather a bore having to spend all your money in rings and that sort of thing, instead of in grub; though I really think I'd have given up grub for Miss Eleanor.\"  \"I wonder,\" said Morris, who was of a more prosaic disposition, \"how it is that it's always much jollier having a feed when you ought not to than at the proper time.  For instance, eating this pork-pie at a table, with knife and fork and a"]]]
