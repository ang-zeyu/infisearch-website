The mild yet dignified countenance of the elder had won his respect and confidence; and he hoped to gain as great advantages from a more intimate connection with the white men, as they expected from his alliance and support.  Henrich was now able to leave his couch, and again to join Edith and his young companions out of doors; but he still looked delicate, and his former strength and activity had not fully returned. He was, however, able to walk with the assistance of a crutch that his father had made for him; and he formed one of the group that followed the Indians in their procession through the village, and also escorted them as far as the confines of the wood in whose depths their village lay. The Chief remarked the boy, and showed sympathy for his lameness, which he was given to understand was owing to an aggression of the Nausetts; and his eyes flashed, and his nostrils dilated, and his whole countenance was changed from its habitual expression of gentle dignity, to one of fierce hostility. It was evident that, in these Wampanoges, the settlers had secured allies who would be zealous and persevering in protecting them from the attacks of their harassing enemies, the Nausetts; and who would, when the proper time should arrive, assist them in fleeing the district of such troublesome inhabitants.  The Indians returned to their wigwams, and the elder accompanied them, and became an inmate of Mooanam's lodge. He soon began to acquire some knowledge of the language of his host, and also to instruct him and his wife in many English words and phrases, in which their aptitude to learn astonished him. A constant communication was kept up between the Indian village and that of the settlers, and a real regard and esteem sprang up between them. As the spring advanced, Henrich was able to throw aside his crutch, and to accompany his father and mother in their frequent visits to the wigwams, and much of his leisure time was passed in the company of the young Indians of his own age, whose activity and address in all their sports and games he admired and emulated. The presence of his friend Brewster in the Wampanoge village, also gave it increased attractions in the eyes of Henrich.  The good man was still his friend and preceptor; and with his assistance, he made considerable progress in the acquirement of the native language, as well as in every other kind of knowledge that Brewster was able to impart. But all the elder's instructions were made subservient to that best of all knowledge--the knowledge of God, and of his revealed Word; and in this his pupil advanced and grew in a manner that both surprised and delighted him. The boy's naturally thoughtful character had become matured during his long and painful illness; and he had learnt to feel the value of heavenly things, and the comparative littleness of all 'those things which are seen, and are temporal.'  He entered warmly into all the elder's benevolent desires and intentions for the conversion of the dark heathen among whom their lot was cast; and he already looked forward to being his assistant in the holy work. Brewster regarded him as destined to become both a pastor and a zealous and successful missionary, when he should arrive at a proper age; and he frequently spoke of him as his own appointed successor in the spiritual direction of the congregation.  This sacred office Henrich anticipated with pride and satisfaction; for where could he find a more fitting exercise for his adventurous and enterprising spirit, and also for his love of the truth, than in seeking the wild men amid their forests and wildernesses, and winning them to peace, and happiness, and civilization, by the knowledge of the all-powerful doctrines of the gospel?  With the Indians he soon became a great favorite; and the readiness with which he acquired the use of the bow, and learnt to cast the dart, and wield the light tomahawks that were used by the Indian boys to practice their young hands, excited their warmest admiration, and made them prophesy that he would one day become a distinguished Brave. His skill in hunting and fishing also became considerable; and he learnt from his copper-colored friends many of their songs and dances, with which he delighted Edith and Ludovico at home.  His new companions did not draw away his affections from his sister. She was still the object of his warmest love; and to give her pleasure was the strongest desire of his heart. In his long rambles with his Indian play-fellows he never forgot his Edith; and many a stream was crossed, and many a rock was climbed, to procure flowering plants to deck her garden, and creepers to clothe the bower which he had formed for her beneath a venerable walnut-tree that stood within their father's little domain, and at no great distance from their dwelling.  An attempt had been made, at first, by the colonists to follow the example of the primitive church at Jerusalem; and to hold the land of which they had taken possession in common, to be worked by the whole community, and the produce to be equally divided amongst their families in due proportion.  But this plan was soon abandoned, as quite unsuited to the habits and manners of these men of Britain; and every family had a small portion, consisting of an acre each, assigned to it for the special use and maintenance of its members. The fields in every allotment had been sown chiefly with grain procured from the friendly Wampanoges; and for some time past the Nausetts had left them unmolested.  The knowledge which Brewster soon acquired of the soft  and musical language of the natives enabled him, with the assistance of Samoset, who still resided among them, to transact all business between them and his countrymen; and also to become acquainted with the history and circumstances of these useful allies.  He learnt that Mooanam was not the great Sachem or Sagamore of the whole tribe, but that he was the eldest son of Masasoyt, the king or chief of the Wampanoges, who resided at Packanokick, their principal village, which was situated in the state of Rhode Island, near a mountain called Montaup, at a considerable distance from Patupet, the native name for New Plymouth.  The means of a still more extended intercourse was about this time opened to the settlers, by the arrival at New Plymouth of another Indian, who was already acquainted with the English, and who was also a much greater proficient in their language than their friend Samoset. This was no other than Squanto, the man who had been taken prisoner by Captain Hunt some years previous, and conveyed to England. During his residence there, he had learnt to make himself understood in the white man's tongue, and he had also learnt to admire and respect the white man's character.  When, therefore, he had found his way hack to his native land in a fishing vessel, and was informed by the Wampanoge Sagamore--whom he visited in his journey to rejoin his own tribe--that an English settlement had been formed on the shores of Cape Cod Bay, he determined to visit it. Masasoyt encouraged him in this intention, and sent him to his son Mooanam, to be introduced to the strangers, and to assist in forming a permanent alliance with them.  These overtures were joyfully received by the Governor, Mr. Carver, and he determined to take immediate advantage of this opportunity of adding to the strength and security of the infant colony. The intended departure of Samoset also made it very desirable to secure the friendship and the services of the newcomer Squanto; as, notwithstanding the progress which Winslow and some others were making in the Wampanoge language, a native interpreter must long be required, in order to carry on a mutual intercourse.  An embassy to the great Sagamore was therefore resolved on, with a view to confirm and strengthen the alliance that had been formed with his sons: and again Rodolph was selected  to accompany Captain Standish as his aide-de-camp, while Samoset and Squanto were to act as interpreters. The journey was long, and Maitland was obliged reluctantly to refuse Henrich's request to attend him.  He feared the fatigue of so many days' travelling on foot would be too much for his son's strength, and Helen strongly opposed his going.  He therefore gave up the much desired expedition, and endeavored to chase away his feeling of disappointment by renewed exertions in ornamenting the garden, and putting the grounds into a state of perfect order, to please his father on his return.  The expedition was accompanied by the Sagamore's younger son, Quadequina, who was anxious to introduce the new allies of his tribe to his father, and to ensure their friendly reception.  They reached Packanokick after a pleasant journey of about forty miles, and were kindly welcomed by Masasoyt, to whom a messenger had been sent beforehand to prepare him for their arrival.  The Sagamore was a noble-looking old man, and was treated by his son, and by all his subjects, with the most profound respect; nor did his strange costume in any way destroy his kingly appearance. His limbs were naked, and were curiously painted and oiled, and his neck and arms were decorated with strings of large white beads composed of polished bone; while a richly embroidered bag or pouch, containing tobacco, was suspended at the back of his neck. His coronet of feathers was lofty, and of the most brilliant colors, and the rest of his dress consisted of a tunic and moccasins of dressed deer skin, exquisitely worked with colored grass and porcupine's quills. He willingly and fully ratified the treaty which had been made by his sons with the white strangers, whose appearance and manners seemed to prepossess him much in their favor; and after detaining them for some days in his lodge, and entertaining him with the greatest hospitality and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],["title","Town Geology (#0)"],["body","by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk     TOWN GEOLOGY     PREFACE    This little book, including the greater part of this Preface, has  shaped itself out of lectures given to the young men of the city of  Chester.  But it does not deal, in its present form, with the geology  of the neighbourhood of Chester only.  I have tried so to recast it,  that any townsman, at least in the manufacturing districts of England  and Scotland, may learn from it to judge, roughly perhaps, but on the  whole accurately, of the rocks and soils of his own neighbourhood.   He will find, it is true, in these pages, little or nothing about  those \"Old Red Sandstones,\" so interesting to a Scotchman; and he  will have to bear in mind, if he belong to the coal districts of  Scotland, that the \"stones in the wall\" there belong to much older  rocks than those \"New Red Sandstones\" of which this book treats; and  that the coal measures of Scotland, with the volcanic rocks which  have disturbed them, are often very different in appearance to the  English coal measures.  But he will soon learn to distinguish the  relative age of rocks by the fossils found in them, which he can now,  happily, study in many local museums; and he may be certain, for the  rest, that all rocks and soils whatsoever which he may meet have been  laid down by the agents, and according to the laws, which I have  tried to set forth in this book; and these only require, for the  learning of them, the exercise of his own observation and common  sense.  I have not tried to make this a handbook of geological facts.   Such a guide (and none better) the young man will find in Sir Charles  Lyell's \"Student's Elements of Geology.\"  I have tried rather to  teach the method of geology, than its facts; to furnish the student  with a key to all geology, rough indeed and rudimentary, but sure and  sound enough, I trust, to help him to unlock most geological problems  which he may meet, in any quarter of the globe.  But young men must  remember always, that neither this book, nor all the books in the  world, will make them geologists.  No amount of book learning will  make a man a scientific man; nothing but patient observation, and  quiet and fair thought over what he has observed.  He must go out for  himself, see for himself, compare and judge for himself, in the  field, the quarry, the cutting.  He must study rocks, ores, fossils,  in the nearest museum; and thus store his head, not with words, but  with facts.  He must verify--as far as he can--what he reads in  books, by his own observation; and be slow to believe anything, even  on the highest scientific authority, till he has either seen it, or  something like enough to it to make it seem to him probable, or at  least possible.  So, and so only, will he become a scientific man,  and a good geologist; and acquire that habit of mind by which alone  he can judge fairly and wisely of facts of any kind whatsoever.  I say--facts of any kind whatsoever.  If any of my readers should be  inclined to say to themselves:  Geology may be a very pleasant study,  but I have no special fancy for it.  I had rather learn something of  botany, astronomy, chemistry, or what not--I shall answer:  By all  means.  Learn any branch of Natural Science you will.  It matters  little to me which you learn, provided you learn one at least.  But  bear in mind, and settle it in your hearts, that you will learn no  branch of science soundly, so as to master it, and be able to make  use of it, unless you acquire that habit and method of mind which I  am trying to teach you in this book.  I have tried to teach it you by  geology, because geology is, perhaps, the simplest and the easiest of  all physical sciences.  It appeals more than any to mere common  sense.  It requires fewer difficult experiments, and expensive  apparatus.  It requires less previous knowledge of other sciences,  whether pure or mixed; at least in its rudimentary stages.  It is  more free from long and puzzling Greek and Latin words.  It is  specially, the poor man's science.  But if you do not like it, study  something else.  Only study that as you must study geology;  proceeding from the known to the unknown by observation and  experiment.  But here some of my readers may ask, as they have a perfect right to  ask, why I wish young men to learn Natural Science at all?  What good  will the right understanding of geology, or of astronomy, or of  chemistry, or of the plants or animals which they meet--what good, I  say, will that do them?  In the first place, they need, I presume, occupation after their  hours of work.  If any of them answer:  \"We do not want occupation,  we want amusement.  Work is very dull, and we want something which  will excite our fancy, imagination, sense of humour.  We want poetry,  fiction, even a good laugh or a game of play\"--I shall most fully  agree with them.  There is often no better medicine for a hard-worked  body and mind than a good laugh; and the man who can play most  heartily when he has a chance of playing is generally the man who can  work most heartily when he must work.  But there is certainly nothing  in the study of physical science to interfere with genial hilarity;  though, indeed, some solemn persons have been wont to reprove the  members of the British Association, and specially that Red Lion Club,  where all the philosophers are expected to lash their tails and roar,  of being somewhat too fond of mere and sheer fun, after the abstruse  papers of the day are read and discussed.  And as for harmless  amusement, and still more for the free exercise of the fancy and the  imagination, I know few studies to compare with Natural History; with  the search for the most beautiful and curious productions of Nature  amid her loveliest scenery, and in her freshest atmosphere.  I have  known again and again working men who in the midst of smoky cities  have kept their bodies, their minds, and their hearts healthy and  pure by going out into the country at odd hours, and making  collections of fossils, plants, insects, birds, or some other objects  of natural history; and I doubt not that such will be the case with  some of my readers.  Another argument, and a very strong one, in favour of studying some  branch of Natural Science just now is this--that without it you can  hardly keep pace with the thought of the world around you.  Over and above the solid gain of a scientific habit of mind, of which  I shall speak presently, the gain of mere facts, the increased  knowledge of this planet on which we live, is very valuable just now;  valuable certainly to all who do not wish their children and their  younger brothers to know more about the universe than they do.  Natural Science is now occupying a more and more important place in  education.  Oxford, Cambridge, the London University, the public  schools, one after another, are taking up the subject in earnest; so  are the middle-class schools; so I trust will all primary schools  throughout the country; and I hope that my children, at least, if not  I myself, will see the day, when ignorance of the primary laws and  facts of science will be looked on as a defect, only second to  ignorance of the primary laws of religion and morality.  I speak strongly, but deliberately.  It does seem to me strange, to  use the mildest word, that people whose destiny it is to live, even  for a few short years, on this planet which we call the earth, and  who do not at all intend to live on it as hermits, shutting  themselves up in cells, and looking on death as an escape and a  deliverance, but intend to live as comfortably and wholesomely as  they can, they and their children after them--it seems strange, I  say, that such people should in general be so careless about the  constitution of this same planet, and of the laws and facts on which  depend, not merely their comfort and their wealth, but their health  and their very lives, and the health and the lives of their children  and descendants.  I know some will say, at least to themselves:  \"What need for us to  study science?  There are plenty to do that already; and we shall be  sure sooner or later to profit by their discoveries; and meanwhile it  is not science which is needed to make mankind thrive, but simple  common sense.\"  I should reply, that to expect to profit by other men's discoveries  when you do not pay for them--to let others labour in the hope of  entering into their labours, is not a very noble or generous state of  mind--comparable somewhat, I should say, to that of the fatting ox,  who willingly allows the farmer to house him, till for him, feed him,  provided only he himself may lounge in his stall, and eat, and NOT be  thankful.  There is one difference in the two cases, but only one-- that while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox, the  scientific man cannot repay himself by eating you; and so never gets  paid, in most cases, at all.  But as for mankind thriving by common sense:  they have not thriven  by common sense, because they have not used their common sense  according to that regulated method which is called science.  In no  age, in no country, as yet, have the majority of mankind been guided,  I will not say by the love of God, and by the fear of God, but even  by sense and reason.  Not sense and reason, but nonsense and  unreason, prejudice and fancy, greed and haste, have led them to such  results as were to be expected--to superstitions, persecutions, wars,  famines, pestilence, hereditary diseases, poverty, waste--waste  incalculable, and now too often irremediable--waste of life, of  labour, of capital, of raw material, of soil, of manure, of every  bounty which God has bestowed on man, till, as in the eastern  Mediterranean, whole countries, some of the finest in the world, seem  ruined for ever:  and all because men will not learn nor obey those  physical laws of the universe, which (whether we be"]]]
