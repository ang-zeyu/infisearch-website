I shall only add, that of old even the sagest and gravest  persons (persons of most rigid and severe virtue) did much affect  this kind of discourse, and did apply it to noble purposes.  The  great introducer of moral wisdom among the pagans did practise it so  much (by it repressing the windy pride and fallacious vanity of  sophisters in his time), that he thereby got the name of [Greek],  the droll; and the rest of those who pursued his design do, by  numberless stories and apophthegms recorded of them, appear well  skilled and much delighted in this way.  Many great princes (as  Augustus Caesar, for one, many of whose jests are extant in  Macrobius), many grave statesmen (as Cicero particularly, who  composed several books of jests), many famous captains (as Fabius,  M. Cato the Censor, Scipio Africanus, Epaminondas, Themistocles,  Phocion, and many others, whose witty sayings together with their  martial exploits are reported by historians), have pleased  themselves herein, and made it a condiment of their weighty  businesses.  So that practising thus (within certain rule and  compass), we cannot err without great patterns, and mighty patrons.  9.  In fine, since it cannot be shown that such a sportfulness of  wit and fancy doth contain an intrinsic and inseparable turpitude;  since it may be so cleanly, handsomely, and innocently used, as not  to defile or discompose the mind of the speaker, nor to wrong or  harm the hearer, nor to derogate from any worthy subject of  discourse, nor to infringe decency, to disturb peace, to violate any  of the grand duties incumbent on us (piety, charity, justice,  sobriety), but rather sometimes may yield advantage in those  respects; it cannot well absolutely and universally be condemned:   and when not used upon improper matter, in an unfit manner, with  excessive measure, at undue season, to evil purpose, it may be  allowed.  It is bad objects, or bad adjuncts, which do spoil its  indifference and innocence; it is the abuse thereof, to which (as  all pleasant things are dangerous, and apt to degenerate into baits  of intemperance and excess) it is very liable, that corrupteth it;  and seemeth to be the ground why in so general terms it is  prohibited by the Apostle.  Which prohibition to what cases, or what  sorts of jesting it extendeth, we come now to declare.   II.  1.  All profane jesting, all speaking loosely and wantonly  about holy things (things nearly related to God and religion),  making such things the matters of sport and mockery, playing and  trifling with them, is certainly prohibited, as an intolerably vain  and wicked practice.  It is an infallible sign of a vain and light  spirit, which considereth little, and cannot distinguish things, to  talk slightly concerning persons of high dignity, to whom especial  respect is due; or about matters of great importance, which deserve  very serious consideration.  No man speaketh, or should speak, of  his prince, that which he hath not weighed whether it will consist  with that veneration which should be preserved inviolate to him.   And is not the same, is not much greater care to be used in regard  to the incomparably great and glorious Majesty of Heaven?  Yes,  surely, as we should not without great awe think of Him; so we  should not presume to mention His name, His word, His institutions,  anything immediately belonging to Him, without profoundest reverence  and dread.  It is the most enormous sauciness that can be imagined,  to speak petulantly or pertly concerning Him; especially considering  that whatever we do say about Him, we do utter it in His presence,  and to His very face.  \"For there is not,\" as the holy psalmist  considered, \"a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it  altogether.\"  No man also hath the heart to droll, or thinks  raillery convenient, in cases nearly touching his life, his health,  his estate, or his fame:  and are the true life and health of our  soul, are interests in God's favour and mercy, are everlasting glory  and bliss affairs of less moment? are the treasures and joys of  paradise, or the damages and torments in hell, more jesting matters?   No, certainly no:  in all reason therefore it becometh us, and it  infinitely concerneth us, whenever we think of these things, to be  in best earnest, always to speak of them in most sober sadness.  The proper objects of common mirth and sportful divertisement are  mean and petty matters; anything at least is by playing therewith  made such:  great things are thereby diminished and debased;  especially sacred things do grievously suffer thence, being with  extreme indecency and indignity depressed beneath themselves, when  they become the subjects of flashy wit, or the entertainments of  frothy merriment:  to sacrifice their honour to our vain pleasure,  being like the ridiculous fondness of that people which, as AElian  reporteth, worshipping a fly, did offer up an ox thereto.  These  things were by God instituted, and proposed to us for purposes quite  different; to compose our hearts, and settle our fancies in a most  serious frame; to breed inward satisfaction, and joy purely  spiritual; to exercise our most solemn thoughts, and employ our  gravest discourses:  all our speech therefore about them should be  wholesome, apt to afford good instruction, or to excite good  affections; \"good,\" as St. Paul speaketh, \"for the use of edifying,  that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\"  If we must be facetious and merry, the field is wide and spacious;  there are matters enough in the world besides these most august and  dreadful things, to try our faculties and please our humour with;  everywhere light and ludicrous things occur; it therefore doth argue  a marvellous poverty of wit, and barrenness of invention (no less  than a strange defect of goodness, and want of discretion), in those  who can devise no other subjects to frolic upon besides these, of  all most improper and perilous; who cannot seem ingenious under the  charge of so highly trespassing upon decency, disclaiming wisdom,  wounding the ears of others, and their own consciences.  Seem  ingenious, I say; for seldom those persons really are such, or are  capable to discover any wit in a wise and manly way.  'Tis not the  excellency of their fancies, which in themselves are usually sorry  and insipid enough, but the uncouthness of their presumption; not  their extraordinary wit, but their prodigious rashness, which is to  be admired.  They are gazed on, as the doers of bold tricks, who  dare perform that which no sober man will attempt:  they do indeed  rather deserve themselves to be laughed at, than their conceits.   For what can be more ridiculous than we do make ourselves, when we  thus fiddle and fool with our own souls; when, to make vain people  merry, we incense God's earnest displeasure; when, to raise a fit of  present laughter, we expose ourselves to endless wailing and woe;  when, to be reckoned wits, we prove ourselves stark wild?  Surely to  this case we may accommodate that of a truly great wit, King  Solomon:  \"I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth  it?\"  2.  All injurious, abusive, scurrilous jesting, which causelessly or  needlessly tendeth to the disgrace, damage, vexation, or prejudice  in any kind of our neighbour (provoking his displeasure, grating on  his modesty, stirring passion in him), is also prohibited.  When  men, to raise an admiration of their wit, to please themselves, or  gratify the humours of other men, do expose their neighbour to scorn  and contempt, making ignominious reflections upon his person and his  actions, taunting his real imperfections, or fastening imaginary  ones upon him, they transgress their duty, and abuse their wits;  'tis not urbanity, or genuine facetiousness, but uncivil rudeness or  vile malignity.  To do thus, as it is the office of mean and base  spirits (unfit for any worthy or weighty employments), so it is full  of inhumanity, of iniquity, of indecency and folly.  For the  weaknesses of men, of what kind soever (natural or moral, in quality  or in act), considering whence they spring, and how much we are all  subject to them, and do need excuse for them, do in equity challenge  compassion to be had of them; not complacency to be taken in them,  or mirth drawn from them; they, in respect to common humanity,  should rather be studiously connived at, and concealed, or mildly  excused, than wilfully laid open, and wantonly descanted upon; they  rather are to be deplored secretly, than openly derided.  The reputation of men is too noble a sacrifice to be offered up to  vainglory, fond pleasure, or ill-humour; it is a good far more dear  and precious, than to be prostituted for idle sport and  divertisement.  It becometh us not to trifle with that which in  common estimation is of so great moment--to play rudely with a thing  so very brittle, yet of so vast price; which being once broken or  cracked, it is very hard and scarce possible to repair.  A small,  transient pleasure, a tickling the ears, wagging the lungs, forming  the face into a smile, a giggle, or a hum, are not to be purchased  with the grievous distaste and smart, perhaps with the real damage  and mischief of our neighbour, which attend upon contempt.  This is  not jesting, surely, but bad earnest; 'tis wild mirth, which is the  mother of grief to those whom we should tenderly love; 'tis  unnatural sport, which breedeth displeasure in them whose delight it  should promote, whose liking it should procure:  it crosseth the  nature and design of this way of speaking, which is to cement and  ingratiate society, to render conversation pleasant and sprightly,  for mutual satisfaction and comfort."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10274"],["title","Sermons on Evil-Speaking (#4)"],["body"," festivity is called salt, and such it should be, giving a smart  but savoury relish to discourse; exciting an appetite, not  irritating disgust; cleansing sometimes, but never creating a sore:   and [Greek], (if it become thus insipid), or unsavoury, it is  therefore good for nothing, but to be cast out, and trodden under  foot of men.  Such jesting which doth not season wholesome or  harmless discourse, but giveth a haut gout to putrid and poisonous  stuff, gratifying distempered palates and corrupt stomachs, is  indeed odious and despicable folly, to be cast out with loathing, to  be trodden under foot with contempt.  If a man offends in this sort,  to please himself, 'tis scurvy malignity; if to delight others, 'tis  base servility and flattery:  upon the first score he is a buffoon  to himself; upon the last, a fool to others.  And well in common  speech are such practisers so termed, the grounds of that practice  being so vain, and the effect so unhappy.  The heart of fools, saith  the wise man, is in the house of mirth; meaning, it seems,  especially such hurtfully wanton mirth:  for it is (as he further  telleth us) the property of fools to delight in doing harm (\"It is  as sport to a fool to do mischief\").  Is it not in earnest most  palpable folly, for so mean ends to do so great harm; to disoblige  men in sport; to lose friends and get enemies for a conceit; out of  a light humour to provoke fierce wrath, and breed tough hatred; to  engage one's self consequently very far in strife, danger, and  trouble?  No way certainly is more apt to produce such effects than  this; nothing more speedily inflameth, or more thoroughly engageth  men, or sticketh longer in men's hearts and memories, than bitter  taunts and scoffs:  whence this honey soon turns into gall; these  jolly comedies do commonly terminate in woeful tragedies.  Especially this scurrilous and scoffing way is then most detestable  when it not only exposeth the blemishes and infirmities of men, but  abuseth piety and virtue themselves; flouting persons for their  constancy in devotion, or their strict adherence to a conscientious  practice of duty; aiming to effect that which Job complaineth of,  \"The just upright man is laughed to scorn;\" resembling those whom  the psalmist thus describeth, \"Who whet their tongue like a sword,  and bend their arrows, even bitter words, that they may shoot in  secret at the perfect;\" serving good men as Jeremy was served--\"The  word of the Lord,\" saith he, \"was made a reproach unto me, and a  derision daily.\"  This practice doth evidently in the highest degree tend to the  disparagement and discouragement of goodness; aiming to expose it,  and to render men ashamed thereof; and it manifestly proceedeth from  a desperate corruption of mind, from a mind hardened and emboldened,  sold and enslaved to wickedness:  whence they who deal therein are  in Holy Scripture represented as egregious sinners, or persons  superlatively wicked, under the name of scorners ([Greek], pests, or  pestilent men, the Greek translators call them, properly enough in  regard to the effects of their practice); concerning whom the wise  man (signifying how God will meet with them in their own way) saith,  \"Surely the Lord scorneth the scorners.\"  '[Greek] (scoffers, or  mockers), St. Peter termeth them, who walk according to their own  lusts; who not being willing to practise, are ready to deride  virtue; thereby striving to seduce others into their pernicious  courses.  This offence also proportionably groweth more criminal as it  presumeth to reach persons eminent in dignity or worth, unto whom  special veneration is appropriate.  This adjoineth sauciness to  scurrility, and advanceth the wrong thereof into a kind of  sacrilege.  'Tis not only injustice, but profaneness, to abuse the  gods.  Their station is a sanctuary from all irreverence and  reproach; they are seated on high, that we may only look up to them  with respect; their defects are not to be seen, or not to be touched  by malicious or wanton wits, by spiteful or scornful tongues:  the  diminution of their credit is a public mischief, and the State  itself doth suffer in their becoming objects of scorn; not only  themselves are vilified and degraded, but the great affairs they  manage are obstructed, the justice they administer is disparaged  thereby.  In fine, no jesting is allowable which is not thoroughly innocent:   it is an unworthy perverting of wit to employ it in biting and  scratching; in working prejudice to any man's reputation or  interest; in needlessly incensing any man's anger or sorrow; in  raising animosities, dissensions, and feuds among any.  Whence it is somewhat strange that any men from so mean and silly a  practice should expect commendation, or that any should afford  regard thereto; the which it is so far from meriting, that indeed  contempt and abhorrence are due to it.  Men do truly more render  themselves despicable than others when, without just ground, or  reasonable occasion, they do attack others in this way.  That such a  practice doth ever find any encouragement or acceptance, whence can  it proceed, but from the bad nature and small judgment of some  persons?  For to any man who is endowed with any sense of goodness,  and hath a competence of true wit, or a right knowledge of good  manners (who knows. . . . inurbanum lepido seponere dicto), it  cannot but be unsavoury and loathsome.  The repute it obtaineth is  in all respects unjust.  So would it appear, not only were the cause  to be decided in a court of morality, because it consists not with  virtue and wisdom; but even before any competent judges of wit  itself.  For he overthrows his own pretence, and cannot reasonably  claim any interest in wit, who doth thus behave himself:  he  prejudgeth himself to want wit, who cannot descry fit matter to  divert himself or others:  he discovereth a great straitness and  sterility of good invention, who cannot in all the wide field of  things find better subjects of discourse; who knows not how to be  ingenious within reasonable compass, but to pick up a sorry conceit  is forced to make excursions beyond the bounds of honesty and  decency.  Neither is it any argument of considerable ability in him that haps  to please this way:  a slender faculty will serve the turn.  The  sharpness of his speech cometh not from wit so much as from choler,  which furnisheth the lowest inventions with a kind of pungent  expression, and giveth an edge to every spiteful word:  so that any  dull wretch doth seem to scold eloquently and ingeniously.  Commonly  also satirical taunts do owe their seeming piquancy, not to the  speaker or his words, but to the subject, and the hearers; the  matter conspiring with the bad nature or the vanity of men who love  to laugh at any rate, and to be pleased at the expense of other  men's repute; conceiting themselves extolled by the depression of  their neighbour, and hoping to gain by his loss.  Such customers  they are that maintain the bitter wits, who otherwise would want  trade, and might go a-begging.  For commonly they who seem to excel  this way are miserably flat in other discourse, and most dully  serious:  they have a particular unaptness to describe any good  thing, or commend any worthy person; being destitute of right ideas,  and proper terms answerable to such purposes:  their representations  of that kind are absurd and unhandsome; their eulogies (to use their  own way of speaking) are in effect satires, and they can hardly more  abuse a man than by attempting to commend him; like those in the  prophet, who were wise to do ill, but to do well had no knowledge.  3.  I pass by that it is very culpable to be facetious in obscene  and smutty matters.  Such things are not to be discoursed on either  in jest or in earnest; they must not, as St. Paul saith, be so much  as named among Christians.  To meddle with them is not to disport,  but to defile one's self and others.  There is indeed no more  certain sign of a mind utterly debauched from piety and virtue than  by affecting such talk.  But further--  4.  All unseasonable jesting is blamable.  As there are some proper  seasons of relaxation, when we may desipere in loco; so there are  some times, and circumstances of things, wherein it concerneth and  becometh men to be serious in mind, grave in demeanour, and plain in  discourse; when to sport in this way is to do indecently or  uncivilly, to be impertinent or troublesome.  It comporteth not well with the presence of superiors, before whom  it becometh us to be composed and modest, much less with the  performance of sacred offices, which require an earnest attention,  and most serious frame of mind.  In deliberations and debates about affairs of great importance, the  simple manner of speaking to the point is the proper, easy, clear,  and compendious way:  facetious speech there serves only to obstruct  and entangle business, to lose time, and protract the result.  The  shop and exchange will scarce endure jesting in their lower  transactions:  the Senate, the Court of Justice, the Church do much  more exclude it from their more weighty consultations.  Whenever it  justleth out, or hindereth the despatch of other serious business,  taking up the room or swallowing the time due to it, or indisposing  the minds of the audience to attend it, then it is unseasonable and  pestilent.  [Greek] (to play, that we may be seriously busy), is the  good rule (of Anacharsis), implying the subordination of sport to  business, as a condiment and furtherance, not an impediment or clog  thereto.  He that for his sport neglects his business, deserves  indeed to be reckoned among children; and children's fortune will  attend him, to be pleased with toys, and to fail of substantial  profit.  'Tis again improper (because indeed uncivil, and inhuman) to jest  with persons that are in a sad or afflicted condition; as arguing  want of due"]]]
