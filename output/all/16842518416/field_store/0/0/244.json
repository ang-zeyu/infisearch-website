'Thou hast said something,' I told him; 'go and get your old scow ready and I'm with you.'\"  Then he hit me a good rap on the shoulder and said, \"So you see how it was, kiddo? Instead of going home to hear how handsome I looked, I just beat it up that creek and fished this suit of greasy rags out of one of the lockers. There was a key in the padlock and I just took off my uniform and stuffed it in the locker and beat it over to Little Landing in Bridgeboro.\"  \"You locked the padlock and took the key, didn't you?\" I said.  \"Righto,\" he said, \"and I thought I'd be back that same night and down to Dix again by morning. See? But instead of that, here I am and blamed near a week gone by and Uncle Sam on the hunt for me. A nice pickle I'm in. What do you say?\"  \"Gee, I wouldn't want to be you,\" I said; \"anyway, I'm sorry for you. But I don't see why you didn't go back like you said.\" Then he went over to the railing and looked all around in a hurry.  \"I guess they won't be back for an hour yet,\" I told him; \"they went to the movies.\"  So he came back and sat down beside me again and began talking very excited, as if I was kind of a friend of his, the way he talked. You know what I mean. And, cracky, any fellow would be glad to be a friend of his, that's sure, even if he _was_ kind of reckless and--you know.  He said, \"I had so many adventures, old top, that I couldn't tell 'em to you. Jakey and I have Robinson Crusoe tearing his hair from jealousy. Kiddo, this last week has been a whole sea story; in itself-- just one hair's-breadth escape after another. Ever read _Treasure Island?_\"  \"_Did I!_\" I said.  Then he said, \"Well _Treasure Island_ is like a church social compared to what I've been through. Some day I'm going to tell you about it.\"  I said, \"I wish you'd tell me now.\"  \"Some night around the camp-fire I'll tell you,\" he said. \"We were fishing off Sea Gate and the fish just stood on line waiting for a chance to bite. We sold three boatfuls in the one day and whacked up about seventy dollars--what do you think of that? Then we chugged around into Coney for gas and on the way back we got mussed up with the tide and were carried out to sea--banged around for three days, bailing and trying to fry fish on the muffler. On the fourth day we were picked up by a fishing schooner about fifty miles off Rockaway and towed in. I said to Jakey, I'm Mike Corby, remember that, and if you give your right name I'll kill you--you've got to protect me,' I said, 'because I'm in bad.' You see how it was, kiddo? I was three days overdue at camp and didn't even have my uniform. I was so tired bailing and standing lookout that when they set us down on the wharf at Rockaway, I could have slept standing on my head. And I've gone without sleep fifty hours at a stretch on the West Front in France--would you believe it?\"  \"Sure, I believe it,\" I told him.  \"I'll tell you the whole business some day when you and I are on the hike.\"  I said, \"Cracky, you can bet I'd like to go on a hike with you.\"  \"That's what we will,\" he said, \"and we'll swap adventures.\"  I told him I didn't have any good ones like he had to swap, but anyway, I was glad he got home all right.  \"_All right!_\" he said, \"you mean all _wrong_. Maybe you saw the accounts in the papers of the two fishermen who were picked up after a _harrowing experience_--Mike Corby and Dan McCann. That was us. I left Jakey down at Rockaway to wait for his engine to be fixed and beat it out to Jersey. _No house-boat_! Was I up in the air? Didn't even dare to go up to the house and ask about it. That rotten little newspaper in Bridgeboro had a big headliner about me disappearing--'_never seen after leaving Camp Dix; whereabouts a mystery_'--that's what it said, '_son of Professor Donnelle_.' What'd you think of that?\"  I told him I was mighty sorry for him, and I was, too.  Then he said how he went to New York in those old rags, and tried not to see anybody he knew and even he hid his face when he saw Mr. Cooper on the train. And then he telephoned out to Bridgeboro and Little Valley and made believe he was somebody else, and said he heard the houseboat was for sale and in that way he found out about his father loaning it to our troop, and how we were probably anchored near St. George at Staten Island. Oh, boy, didn't he hurry up to get there, because he was afraid we might be gone.  So then he waited till night and he was just wondering whether it would be safe to wait till we were all asleep and then sneak onto the boat, when all of a sudden he saw the fellows coming ashore and he got near and listened and he heard them speak about going to the movies, and he heard one fellow say something about how Roy would be sorry he didn't come. And do you want to know what he told me? This is just what he said; he said, \"When I heard your name was Roy, I knew you'd be all right--see? Because look at Rob Roy,\" he said; \"wasn't he a bully hero and a good scout and a fellow you could trust with a secret--wasn't he?\" That's just what he said. \"You take a fellow named Roy,\" he said, \"and you'll always find him true and loyal.\" He said there was a fellow named Roy on the West Front and he gave up his life before he'd tell on a comrade.  Then he said, \"You see how it is with me, Skeezeks, I'm in a peck of trouble and I've got to get those army duds on and toddle back to camp as soon as I can get there and face the music. I've got to make an excuse--I've got to get that blamed uniform pressed somehow--I suppose it's creased from the dampness in that locker. I've got to straighten matters out if I can. I just managed to save my life, and by heck, I'll be lucky if I can just save my honor and that's the plain truth.\"  \"So you see I've got a lot to do,\" he said, \"and you've got just the one thing to do, and that's a cinch. It's to keep your mouth shut--see? Suppose the old gent knew about this. Suppose my sister knew I was within a quarter of a mile of the house and didn't go to see them. You know what girls are.\"  I told him, \"Sure, because I've got two sisters. And I bet they'd like you, too. I bet they'd say you were good looking.\" Then he began to laugh and he said, \"Well, I bet I'd like them too, if they're anything like you. So now will you keep your mouth shut? Ever hear of the scouts' oath? The Indian scouts' oath, I mean--loyalty for better or worser? Don't say I was here. Don't say you know anything about me. Keep your mouth shut. If my name should be mentioned, keep still. You don't know anything. Nobody was here, see?\"  I said, \"Suppose Mr. Ellsworth or somebody should ask me?\"  \"Who's going to ask you?\" he said; \"you say nothing and they'll say nothing. I fought for my country, kiddo, and I've got two wounds. You don't want to spoil it all for me now, do you?\"  I said, \"I bet you're brave, anyhow.\"  \"I'd rather face two German divisions than what I've got to face to-morrow,\" he said; \"but if I know it's all right at this end, I won't worry. Are you straight?\"  \"I wouldn't tell,\" I told him; \"cracky, why should _I_ tell? And I can see you've got a lot of trouble and you're not exactly all to blame, anyway. Only I hope I'll see you again sometime because, anyway, whatever you did I kind of like you. It's one of our laws that a fellow has to be loyal. Only sometime will you tell me some of the things you did--I mean your adventures?\"  \"I'll tell you all about the jungles and the man-eating apes down in Central America,\" he said.  So then he went into the cabin in a big hurry and he took the key out of his pocket and he opened the locker and took out his uniform. It was all wrinkled and damp, but anyway, he looked fine in it, you can bet. After he got it all on and fixed right, he stuffed his old clothes into the place and locked it up again. I bet any girl would say he looked fine, that's one thing sure.  Just before he climbed over the railing he put his hand in his pocket and took out some change and he was in such a hurry that he dropped some of it and it went all over the deck. I started to pick it up for him, but he only said, \"Never mind, let it go, you can have all you find, and here's a quarter to get a couple of sodas.\"  I said, \"We don't take anything for a service, scouts don't.\"  \"Well, you can have a soda on me, can't you?\" he said, trying to make me take the quarter.  \"If you want me to be loyal to you, I have to be loyal if I make a promise, don't I?\" I said.  He said, \"What promise?\"  And I said, \"I can't take anything for a service.\"  Then he hit me a rap on the shoulder and laughed and he punched me in the chest, not hard, only kind of as if to show me that he liked me. Then he said, \"Bully for you, kiddo, you're one little trump.\" Then, all of a sudden he was gone.  Sometimes you can't tell just why you like a fellow, but, anyway, I liked him just the same.    CHAPTER IV  TELLS ABOUT THE PAPER I FOUND  One thing, I bet it was Pee-wee Harris that the lieutenant heard talking, while he was hiding on shore. Anyway, it was Pee-wee that I heard first when they were on their way back--that's sure. You know how plain you can hear voices on the water. And believe me, before those fellows were half way out I knew all about the bandit of Red Hallow. That was the fellow in the movies, I suppose, and he must have been some bandit, because he saved a school teacher from about twenty other bandits, and shot them all. I guess everybody was shooting pistols at everybody else, like they mostly do in the movies. Pee-wee was sticking up for the poor school teacher, and it made me laugh because he hasn't got much use for school teachers on account of they're always keeping him in for talking. Anyway, what fun is there in everybody shooting pistols at each other. Me for stalking, that's what _I_ say.  When Mr. Ellsworth came on board he said, \"Well, Roy, alone in your glory, eh?\" I didn't say anything and I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10316"],["title","Roy Blakeley's Adventures in Camp (#3)"],["body","he wouldn't ask me any questions, because anyway, I wasn't going to lie, that's one sure thing. I asked him how the fellows liked the movies and he said, everybody got shot so they were all satisfied. He was just joking. He asked the fellows if they'd like to meet a lot of bandits in real life, and they said, \"_Good night_, no.\" And then he said it was funny how they liked to meet them in the movies and all the fellows had to admit it was crazy. You wouldn't catch Mr. Ellsworth stopping us from going to the movies, but he always makes us feel silly afterward.  Pretty soon Grove Bronson, who is one of the Raving Ravens, came up to me and gave me a newspaper with a whole lot of ears of corn in it, and said we were going to have it for Sunday dinner.  Pee-wee said, \"They're dandy big ears all right, and here's some cans of tongue.\"  \"Good night,\" I told him, \"I thought we had tongue enough with you here.\" Oh, you ought to have seen little Skinny McCord laugh. His face was all thin on account of his not being very strong and he never had much food until he got in with us, either. But it was fun to see him laugh whenever we got back at Pee-wee.  \"There's some heads of cabbage, too,\" he said; \"Doc's got them.\"  \"Heads and ears and tongues,\" I said; \"you ought to have brought some potatoes, so we'd have eyes.\" He thinks I'm funny, but I just say those things to make him laugh, so as he'll feel good.  Then I took all the stuff into the galley and put it in the food locker. I was just crunching up the newspaper that they brought the corn in, and was going to throw it out of the window, when I saw a heading that read: _Fishermen Have Harrowing Adventure_. Oh, boy, didn't I sit down on the barrel and read that article through! First, I looked to see the date of the paper and I saw it was a couple of days old. After I read that article I cut it out, because I knew I was going to tell you about all these things. So here it is now for you to read:      FISHERMEN HAVE HARROWING ADVENTURE      The fishing schooner Stella B arrived in     port to-day with two castaways, who had     drifted for three days in an open boat in the     stormy waters off Rockaway. The two     men, Mike Corby and Dan McCann, hail     from Jersey, and were carried out to sea in     their twenty-two foot launch from about     a mile south of Sea Gate, where they were     fishing.      Their engine broke down and their small     boat, beaten by the waves, was leaking     rapidly when they were picked up. One of     the men was unconscious from lack of     nourishment and the other in a state of     utter exhaustion from bailing, in an all but     futile effort to keep the frail little craft     above water. After being resuscitated, one     of the men gave a vague account of having     encountered a waterlogged life-boat containing     several people who had perished     from exposure, and of certain papers and     possessions found on one of them.      Later when a reporter made an effort to     see the men for confirmation of this statement,     neither could be found. Both are     said to have carried considerable money on     their persons, but this was explained by the     exceptionally large catches of fish which     they sold, during their fishing trip. No     means of tracing them is known since the     boat, in which one of them resumed his     journey home after repairs, had no license     number.  Maybe you think I didn't read that article twice. And it made me wonder a lot of things about that fishing trip. One thing, it looked as if they might have had more adventures than Lieutenant Donnelle had told me about, and maybe he didn't want to tell me everything--that's what I thought. Anyway, he didn't say anything about a life-boat, that's sure. But maybe he forgot to.  Just the same I wondered if maybe he had any other reason for being in such a hurry and so excited, kind of. Then I remembered how he said he would tell me all about it some day. Anyway, I said, he's had a lot of adventures, that's sure. You bet I'd like to have a lot of adventures like that.    CHAPTER V  TELLS ABOUT SKINNY'S MERIT BADGE  The next day was Sunday and two things happened, not counting dinner. Early in the morning we drew lots to see who'd be deck steward for the day, and Skinny was the one. That meant he'd have to sweep up the deck and wipe the rail and do everything outside like that. Anyway, there wasn't much to do.  At about twelve o'clock I went into the galley to cook dinner and Charlie Seabury and Brick Warner went along to help me. While we were peeling the potatoes, Skinny came in and showed me three or four dimes and some pennies, and said he found them on the deck, when he was sweeping. He said, \"I've been to every fellow in the troop and nobody lost any money. Are they yours?\"  I told him no and so did Brick and Charlie and we said he had better give them to Mr. Ellsworth. \"One of them is a French coin,\" Brick said, and he showed it to me and I saw that it was.  \"I guess one of the fellows dropped some change climbing over the rail,\" Charlie said, \"and maybe didn't miss it on account of not losing all he had, hey?\"  \"He'd know if he had a French coin and lost it,\" Brick said.  It made me feel kind of funny, because all the while I knew where those coins came from. Anyway, Skinny went and gave them to Mr. Ellsworth and when we were all together at dinner, Mr. Ellsworth asked us if any fellow owned a French coin that was missing. Nobody said yes, and then he said, kind of funny like, \"Well, I suppose this is what our young friend Mr. Walter Harris would call a mystery,\" and he said we'd put the money in the troop treasury. Then he gave it to Will Dawson (he's in my patrol), because Will is troop treasurer.  Somebody said, \"How about the French coin? That's no use in the treasury.\" And Mr. Ellsworth said we'd give that to Skinny, because he found the money. He said it would be a kind of a merit badge to Skinny, for keeping his eyes open.  I was mighty glad Mr. Ellsworth didn't ask us if anybody knew anything about the money, because then--jiminy, I don't know what I would have done. Maybe it would have been all right to keep still because I wasn't _dead_ sure whose it was. But all the while I knew I _was_ sure. Maybe I would have said I knew only I didn't want to tell, hey? Anyway, he didn't ask and that was one good thing.  After dinner Skinny came to me all smiles and said, \"I've got a merit badge, it's for keeping my eyes open, and will you bore a hole in it so I can wear it around my neck?\" Oh, but that kid was happy.  I said, \"Did you have a good dinner, kiddo?\" And he said, \"Yes, but will you bore a hole in it so I can wear it around my neck?\" He looked awful thin and his scout suit didn't fit him and his belt wasn't tight enough and he didn't look anything like pictures you see of scouts--you know what I mean. And when he smiled it made wrinkles in his cheeks. One thing sure, he was different from all the rest of the fellows. Even if it was only a little thing that he was interested in, he got all excited about it, and his eyes got all bright and if he grabbed you by the arm you could feel that his hand was trembling--he'd be so excited. We made a lot of allowance for him, because he was sick and came out of the slums, but anyway, one trouble with him was, that Mr. Ellsworth couldn't make him study up scouting the way other fellows do. All of a sudden he'd go crazy for the gold medal or the eagle badge and you couldn't tell him that a fellow has to get to be a first class scout, before he can be an eagle scout. \"He wants what he wants when he wants it,\" that's what Mr. Ellsworth said, and he only just laughed and said, \"He'll hammer into shape all right, let him enjoy the trip.\"  And it was just like him--I mean about that French coin. He was always coming to me, too, as if I was scoutmaster and everything else. He began clutching me by the arm and saying, \"I got it for keeping my eyes open, didn't I? I got it for being honest and asking all the scout guys, didn't I?\"  I had to just pull his hand off my arm, he was holding so fast to it. Cracky, I didn't know what to tell him. Then I said, \"I tell you what you do Alf.\" (I wasn't going to be calling him Skinny,) I said, \"You go and ask Vic Norris if he's got an awl or a small gimlet--see? Then I'll fix it for you.\" Vic had charge of the locker where we kept the lights and oil and tools and all that kind of stuff.  Pretty soon he came back with an awning needle and asked me if it would do. I think he would have gone crazy if I had told him no.  I said, \"Yes, I guess so. Come ahead, and let go my arm, do you hear? I'm not going to run away.\"  Then he said, \"I like you better than any of the scout guys.\"  \"We're not guys, we're just scouts,\" I told him; \"you can cut out the guys. Didn't Mr. Ellsworth tell you that?\"  The fellows were sitting around on the deck, reading. Some of them were sprawling around on the cabin roof, killing time and jollying Pee-wee. I don't know where Mr. Ellsworth was, but I guess he was inside writing letters. Anyway, it was nice and sunny and you could see the sun in the water. Over on shore, in St. George, I could hear a church bell and it sounded clear. There weren't many boats out, except sometimes the boats to Coney Island went by and we could hear the music. I thought I'd rather be where I was, anyway. Maybe it was because it was Sunday and because it was so still all around that I had a good idea. Anyway, I thought it was a good idea, but _good night_, it got me into a kind of a scrape.  That's one thing about me, I'm always getting in scrapes.  So then I took Skinny and we climbed in through the galley window. I guess nobody noticed us; nobody said anything except El Sawyer. He asked me if I was going to get supper.  \"Supper!\" I said. \"Didn't you just have dinner?\" Honest, that fellow never thinks of anything except eats.  When we got into the galley, I said to"]]]
