But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,     And for another still remains the longing,     We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,  E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,     To learn from her what was the web wherein     She did not ply the shuttle to the end.  “A perfect life and merit high in-heaven     A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule     Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,  That until death they may both watch and sleep     Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts     Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.  To follow her, in girlhood from the world     I fled, and in her habit shut myself,     And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.  Then men accustomed unto evil more     Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;     God knows what afterward my life became.  This other splendour, which to thee reveals     Itself on my right side, and is enkindled     With all the illumination of our sphere,  What of myself I say applies to her;     A nun was she, and likewise from her head     Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.  But when she too was to the world returned     Against her wishes and against good usage,     Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.  Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,     Who from the second wind of Suabia     Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”  Thus unto me she spake, and then began     “Ave Maria” singing, and in singing     Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.  My sight, that followed her as long a time     As it was possible, when it had lost her     Turned round unto the mark of more desire,  And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;     But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,     That at the first my sight endured it not;  And this in questioning more backward made me.     Paradiso: Canto IV   Between two viands, equally removed     And tempting, a free man would die of hunger     Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.  So would a lamb between the ravenings     Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;     And so would stand a dog between two does.  Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,     Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,     Since it must be so, nor do I commend.  I held my peace; but my desire was painted     Upon my face, and questioning with that     More fervent far than by articulate speech.  Beatrice did as Daniel had done     Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath     Which rendered him unjustly merciless,  And said: “Well see I how attracteth thee     One and the other wish, so that thy care     Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.  Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,     The violence of others, for what reason     Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?  Again for doubting furnish thee occasion     Souls seeming to return unto the stars,     According to the sentiment of Plato.  These are the questions which upon thy wish     Are thrusting equally; and therefore first     Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.  He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,     Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John     Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,  Have not in any other heaven their seats,     Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,     Nor of existence more or fewer years;  But all make beautiful the primal circle,     And have sweet life in different degrees,     By feeling more or less the eternal breath.  They showed themselves here, not because allotted     This sphere has been to them, but to give sign     Of the celestial which is least exalted.  To speak thus is adapted to your mind,     Since only through the sense it apprehendeth     What then it worthy makes of intellect.  On this account the Scripture condescends     Unto your faculties, and feet and hands     To God attributes, and means something else;  And Holy Church under an aspect human     Gabriel and Michael represent to you,     And him who made Tobias whole again.  That which Timaeus argues of the soul     Doth not resemble that which here is seen,     Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.  He says the soul unto its star returns,     Believing it to have been severed thence     Whenever nature gave it as a form.  Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise     Than the words sound, and possibly may be     With meaning that is not to be derided.  If he doth mean that to these wheels return     The honour of their influence and the blame,     Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.  This principle ill understood once warped     The whole world nearly, till it went astray     Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.  The other doubt which doth disquiet thee     Less venom has, for its malevolence     Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.  That as unjust our justice should appear     In eyes of mortals, is an argument     Of faith, and not of sin heretical.  But still, that your perception may be able     To thoroughly penetrate this verity,     As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.  If it be violence when he who suffers     Co-operates not with him who uses force,     These souls were not on that account excused;  For will is never quenched unless it will,     But operates as nature doth in fire     If violence a thousand times distort it.  Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds     The force; and these have done so, having power     Of turning back unto the holy place.  If their will had been perfect, like to that     Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,     And Mutius made severe to his own hand,  It would have urged them back along the road     Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;     But such a solid will is all too rare.  And by these words, if thou hast gathered them     As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted     That would have still annoyed thee many times.  But now another passage runs across     Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself     Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.  I have for certain put into thy mind     That soul beatified could never lie,     For it is near the primal Truth,  And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard     Costanza kept affection for the veil,     So that she seemeth here to contradict me.  Many times, brother, has it come to pass,     That, to escape from peril, with reluctance     That has been done it was not right to do,  E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father     Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)     Not to lose pity pitiless became.  At this point I desire thee to remember     That force with will commingles, and they cause     That the offences cannot be excused.  Will absolute consenteth not to evil;     But in so far consenteth as it fears,     If it refrain, to fall into more harm.  Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,     She meaneth the will absolute, and I     The other, so that both of us speak truth.”  Such was the flowing of the holy river     That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;     This put to rest my wishes one and all.  “O love of the first lover, O divine,”     Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me     And warms me so, it more and more revives me,  My own affection is not so profound     As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;     Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.  Well I perceive that never sated is     Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,     Beyond which nothing true expands itself.  It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,     When it attains it; and it can attain it;     If not, then each desire would frustrate be.  Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,     Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,     Which to the top from height to height impels us.  This doth invite me, this assurance give me     With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you     Another truth, which is obscure to me.  I wish to know if man can satisfy you     For broken vows with other good deeds, so     That in your balance they will not be light.”  Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes     Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,     That, overcome my power, I turned my back  And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.     Paradiso: Canto V   “If in the heat of love I flame upon thee     Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,     So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,  Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds     From perfect sight, which as it apprehends     To the good apprehended moves its feet.  Well I perceive how is already shining     Into thine intellect the eternal light,     That only seen enkindles always love;  And if some other thing your love seduce,     ’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,     Ill understood, which there is shining through.  Thou fain wouldst know if with another service     For broken vow can such return be made     As to secure the soul from further claim.”  This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;     And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,     Continued thus her holy argument:  “The greatest gift that in his largess God     Creating made, and unto his own goodness     Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize  Most highly, is the freedom of the will,     Wherewith the creatures of intelligence     Both all and only were and are endowed.  Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,     The high worth of a vow, if it he made     So that when thou consentest God consents:  For, closing between God and man the compact,     A sacrifice is of this treasure made,     Such as I say, and made by its own act.  What can be rendered then as compensation?     Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,     With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.  Now art thou certain of the greater point;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1003"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Paradise (#3)"],["body","because Holy Church in this dispenses,     Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,  Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,     Because the solid food which thou hast taken     Requireth further aid for thy digestion.  Open thy mind to that which I reveal,     And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,     The having heard without retaining it.  In the essence of this sacrifice two things     Convene together; and the one is that     Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement.  This last for evermore is cancelled not     Unless complied with, and concerning this     With such precision has above been spoken.  Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews     To offer still, though sometimes what was offered     Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know.  The other, which is known to thee as matter,     May well indeed be such that one errs not     If it for other matter be exchanged.  But let none shift the burden on his shoulder     At his arbitrament, without the turning     Both of the white and of the yellow key;  And every permutation deem as foolish,     If in the substitute the thing relinquished,     As the four is in six, be not contained.  Therefore whatever thing has so great weight     In value that it drags down every balance,     Cannot be satisfied with other spending.  Let mortals never take a vow in jest;     Be faithful and not blind in doing that,     As Jephthah was in his first offering,  Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,     Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish     Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,  Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,     And made for her both wise and simple weep,     Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’  Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;     Be ye not like a feather at each wind,     And think not every water washes you.  Ye have the Old and the New Testament,     And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you     Let this suffice you unto your salvation.  If evil appetite cry aught else to you,     Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,     So that the Jew among you may not mock you.  Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon     Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple     Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”  Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;     Then all desireful turned herself again     To that part where the world is most alive.  Her silence and her change of countenance     Silence imposed upon my eager mind,     That had already in advance new questions;  And as an arrow that upon the mark     Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,     So did we speed into the second realm.  My Lady there so joyful I beheld,     As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,     More luminous thereat the planet grew;  And if the star itself was changed and smiled,     What became I, who by my nature am     Exceeding mutable in every guise!  As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,     The fishes draw to that which from without     Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;  So I beheld more than a thousand splendours     Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:     “Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”  And as each one was coming unto us,     Full of beatitude the shade was seen,     By the effulgence clear that issued from it.  Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning     No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have     An agonizing need of knowing more;  And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these     Was in desire of hearing their conditions,     As they unto mine eyes were manifest.  “O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes     To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,     Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned  With light that through the whole of heaven is spread     Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest     To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”  Thus by some one among those holy spirits     Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak     Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”  “Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself     In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,     Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,  But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,     Spirit august, thy station in the sphere     That veils itself to men in alien rays.”  This said I in direction of the light     Which first had spoken to me; whence it became     By far more lucent than it was before.  Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself     By too much light, when heat has worn away     The tempering influence of the vapours dense,  By greater rapture thus concealed itself     In its own radiance the figure saintly,     And thus close, close enfolded answered me  In fashion as the following Canto sings.     Paradiso: Canto VI   “After that Constantine the eagle turned     Against the course of heaven, which it had followed     Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,  Two hundred years and more the bird of God     In the extreme of Europe held itself,     Near to the mountains whence it issued first;  And under shadow of the sacred plumes     It governed there the world from hand to hand,     And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.  Caesar I was, and am Justinian,     Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,     Took from the laws the useless and redundant;  And ere unto the work I was attent,     One nature to exist in Christ, not more,     Believed, and with such faith was I contented.  But blessed Agapetus, he who was     The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere     Pointed me out the way by words of his.  Him I believed, and what was his assertion     I now see clearly, even as thou seest     Each contradiction to be false and true.  As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,     God in his grace it pleased with this high task     To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,  And to my Belisarius I commended     The arms, to which was heaven’s right hand so joined     It was a signal that I should repose.  Now here to the first question terminates     My answer; but the character thereof     Constrains me to continue with a sequel,  In order that thou see with how great reason     Men move against the standard sacrosanct,     Both who appropriate and who oppose it.  Behold how great a power has made it worthy     Of reverence, beginning from the hour     When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.  Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode     Three hundred years and upward, till at last     The three to three fought for it yet again.  Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong     Down to Lucretia’s sorrow, in seven kings     O’ercoming round about the neighboring nations;  Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans     Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,     Against the other princes and confederates.  Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks     Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,     Received the fame I willingly embalm;  It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,     Who, following Hannibal, had passed across     The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;  Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young     Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill     Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;  Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed     To bring the whole world to its mood serene,     Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.  What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,     Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,     And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;  What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,     And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight     That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.  Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then     Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote     That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.  Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,     It saw again, and there where Hector lies,     And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.  From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;     Then wheeled itself again into your West,     Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.  From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer     Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,     And Modena and Perugia dolent were;  Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep     Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,     Took from the adder sudden and black death.  With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;     With him it placed the world in so great peace,     That unto Janus was his temple closed.  But what the standard that has made me speak     Achieved before, and after should achieve     Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,  Becometh in appearance mean and dim,     If in the hand of the third Caesar seen     With eye unclouded and affection pure,  Because the living Justice that inspires me     Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,     The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.  Now here attend to what I answer thee;     Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance     Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.  And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten     The Holy Church, then underneath its wings     Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.  Now hast thou power to judge of such as those     Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,     Which are the cause of all your miseries.  To the public standard one the yellow lilies     Opposes, the other claims it for a party,     So that ’tis hard to see which sins the most.  Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft     Beneath some other standard; for this ever     Ill follows he who it and justice parts.  And let not this new Charles e’er strike it down,     He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons     That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.  Already oftentimes the sons have wept     The father’s crime; and let him not believe     That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.  This little planet doth adorn itself     With the good spirits that have active been,     That fame and honour"]]]
