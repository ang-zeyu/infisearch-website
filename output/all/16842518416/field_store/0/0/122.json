No; we  must think of nothing save what is set down in Holy Writ.  And yet, alas! we cannot use in our days, that which eighteen hundred  years ago was the most simple and obvious test of our Lord's  truthfulness, namely His miraculous powers.  The folly and sin of man  have robbed us of what is, as it were, one of the natural rights of  reasoning, man.  Lying prodigies and juggleries, forged and pretended  miracles, even--oh, shame!--imitations of His most sacred wounds, have,  up to our own time, made all rational men more and more afraid of aught  which seems to savour of the miraculous; till most of us, I think, would  have to ask forgiveness--as I myself should have to ask,--if, tantalized  and insulted again and again by counterfeit miracles, we failed to  recognise real miracles, and Him who performed them.  Therefore, for good  or evil, we should be driven back upon that test alone, which, after all,  perhaps, is the most sure as well as the most convincing--the moral test- -the test of character.  What manner of personage would He be did He  condescend to appear among us?  Of that, thank God, the Gospels ought to  leave us in no doubt.  What acts He might condescend to perform, what  words He might condescend to speak, it is not for such beings as we to  guess.  But how He would demean Himself we know; for Holy Writ has told  us how He demeaned Himself in Judea eighteen hundred years ago; and He is  the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, and can be only like Himself.   But should we know Him merely by His bearing and character?  Should we  see in Him an utterly ideal personage--The Son of Man, and therefore, ere  we lost sight of Him once more, the Son of God?  Let us think.  First,  therefore, we must believe that--as in Judea of old--Christ would meet  men with all consideration and courtesy.  He would not break the bruised  reed, nor quench the smoking flax.  He would not strive, nor cry, nor let  His voice be heard in the streets.  He would not cause any of God's  little ones to offend, to stumble.  In plain words, He would not shock  and repel them by any conduct of His.  Therefore, as in Judea of old, He  would be careful of, even indulgent to, the usages of society, as long as  they were innocent.  He would never outrage the code of manners, however  imperfect, however conventional, which this or any other civilised nation  may have agreed on, to express and keep up respect, self-restraint,  delicacy, of man toward man, of man toward woman, of the young ward the  old, of the living toward the dead.  No.  As I said just now, He would never cause, by any act or word of His, one  of God's little ones to stumble and fall away.  I used just now that word MANNERS.  Let me beg your very serious  attention to it.  I use it, remember, in its true, its ancient--that is,  in its moral and spiritual sense.  I use it as the old Greeks, the old  Romans, used their corresponding words; as our wise forefathers used it,  when they said well, that \"Manners maketh man;\" that manners are at once  the efficient cause of a man's success, and the proof of his deserving to  succeed:  the outward and visible sign of whatsoever inward and spiritual  grace, or disgrace, there may be in him.  I mean by the word what our  Lord meant when He reproved the pushing and vulgar arrogance of the  Scribes and Pharisees, and laid down the golden rule of all good manners,  \"Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and  whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.\"  Next, I beg you to remember that all, or almost all, good manners which  we have among us--courtesies, refinements, self-restraint, and mutual  respect--all which raises us, socially and morally, above our forefathers  of fifteen hundred years ago--deep-hearted men, valiant and noble, but  coarse, and arrogant, and quarrelsome--all that, or almost all, we owe to  Christ, to the influence of His example, and to that Bible which  testifies of Him.  Yes, the Bible has been for Christendom, in the  cottage as much as in the palace, the school of manners; and the saying  that he who becomes a true Christian becomes a true gentleman, is no  rhetorical boast, but a solid historic fact.  Now imagine Christ to reappear on earth, with that perfect outward beauty  of character--with what Greeks and Romans, and our own ancestors, would  have called those perfect manners--which, if we are to believe the  Gospels, He shewed in Judea of old, which won then so many hearts,  especially of the common people, sounder judges often of true nobility  than many who fancy themselves their betters.  Conceive--but which of us  can conceive?--His perfect tenderness, patience, sympathy, graciousness,  and grace, combined with perfect strength, stateliness, even awfulness,  when awe was needed.  Remember that, if, again, the Gospels are to be  believed.  He alone, of all personages of whom history tells us, solved  in His own words and deeds the most difficult paradox of human character- -to be at once utterly conscious, and yet utterly unconscious, of self;  to combine with perfect self-sacrifice a perfect self-assertion.  Whether  or not His being able to do that proved Him to have been that which He  was, the Son of God, it proves Him at least to have been the Son of Man-- the unique and unapproachable ideal of humanity, utterly inspired by the  Holy Spirit of God.  But again:  He condescended, in His teaching of old, to the level of  Jewish, knowledge at that time.  We may, therefore, believe that He would  condescend to the level of our modern knowledge; and what would that  involve?  It would leave Him, however less than Himself, at least master  of all that the human race has thought or discovered in the last eighteen  hundred years.  Think of that.  And think again, that if He condescended,  as in Judea of old, to employ that knowledge in teaching men--He who knew  what was in man, and needed not that any should bear witness to Him of  man--He would manifest a knowledge of human nature to which that of a  Shakspeare would be purblind and dull; a knowledge of which the Scripture  nobly says that \"The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than  any two-edged sword, even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and  of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents  of the heart;\" so that all \"things are naked and opened unto the eyes of  Him with whom we have to do.\"  And consider that, in the light of that  knowledge, He might adapt himself as perfectly to us of this great city,  as He did to the villagers of Galilee, or to the townsmen of Jerusalem.  Consider, again, that He who spoke as never man yet spake in Jerusalem,  might speak as man never yet spoke on English soil; that He who was  listened to gladly once, because He spake with authority, and not as the  scribes, at second hand, and by rule and precedent, might be listened to  gladly here once more.  For He might speak here, not as we poor scribes  can speak at best, but with an authority, originality, earnestness, as  well as an eloquence, which might exercise a fascination, which would be,  to all with whom He came in contact, what Malachi calls it, \"a refiner's  fire\"--most purifying, though often most painful to the very best; a  fascination which might be to every one who came under its spell a  veritable Judgment and Day of the Lord, shewing each man with fearful  clearness to which side he really inclined at heart in the struggle  between truth and falsehood, good and evil; a fascination, therefore,  equally attractive to those who wished to do right, and intolerable to  those who wished to do wrong.  Consider that last thought.  And consider, too, that those to whom the  fascination of such a personage might be so intolerable, that it might  turn to utter hate, would probably be those whose moral sense was so  perverted, that they thought they were doing right when they were doing  wrong, and speaking truth when they were telling lies.  It is an awful  thought.  But we know that there were such men, and too many, among the  scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem.  And human nature is the same in  every age.  Be that as it may--however retired His life, He could not  long be hid.  He would shortly exercise, almost without attempting it, an  enormous public influence.  But yet, as in Judea of old, would He not be only too successful?  Would  He not be at once too liberal for some, and too exacting for others?   Would He not, as in Judea of old, encounter not merely the active envy of  the vain and the ambitious, which would follow one who spoke as never man  spoke; not merely the active malignity of those who wish their fellow- creatures to be bad and not good; not merely the bigotry of every sect  and party; but that mere restless love of new excitements, and that dull  fear and suspicion of new truths, and even of old truths in new words,  which beset the uneducated of every rank and class, and in no age more  than in our own?  And therefore I must ask, in sober sadness, how long  would His influence last?  It lasted, we know, in Judea of old, for some  three years.  And then--.  But I am not going to say that any such  tragedy is possible now.  It would be an insult to Him; an insult to the  gracious influences of His Spirit, the gracious teaching of His Church,  to say that of our generation, however unworthy we may be of our high  calling in Christ.  And yet, if He had appeared in any country of  Christendom only four hundred years ago, might He not have endured an  even more dreadful death than that of the cross?  But doubtless, no personal harm would happen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10116"],["title","All Saints' Day and Other Sermons (#6)"],["body","Him here.  Only there  might come a day, in which, as in Judea of old, \"after He had said these  things, many were offended, and walked no more with Him:\" when his  hearers and admirers would grow fewer and more few, some through bigotry,  some through envy, some through fickleness, some through cowardice, till  He was left alone with a little knot of earnest disciples; who might  diminish, alas, but too rapidly, when they found at He, as in Judea of  old, did not intend to become the head of a new sect, and to gratify  their ambition and vanity by making them His delegates.  And so the  world, the religious world as well as the rest, might let Him go His way,  and vanish from the eyes and minds of men, leaving behind little more  than a regret that one so gifted and so fascinating should have proved--I  hardly like to say the words, and yet they must be said--so unsafe and so  unsound a teacher.  I shall not give now the reasons which have led me, and not in haste, to  this melancholy conclusion.  I shall only say that I have come to it,  with pain, and shame, and fear.  With shame and fear.  For when I ask you  the solemn question, Would you know Christ if He came among you? do I not  ask myself a question which I dare not answer?  How can I tell whether I  should recognise, after all, my Saviour and my Lord?  How do I know that  if He said (as He but too certainly might), something which clashed  seriously with my preconceived notions of what He ought to say, I should  not be offended, and walk no more with Him?  How do I know that if He  said, as in Judea of old, \"Will ye too go away?\" I should answer with St  Peter, \"Lord, to whom shall we go?  Thou hast the words of eternal life,  and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the  living God?\"  I dare not ask that question of myself.  How then dare I  ask it of you?  I know not.  I can only say, \"Lord, I believe:  help thou  mine unbelief.\"  I know not.  But this I know--that in this or any other  world, if you or I did recognise Him, it would be with utter shame and  terror, unless we had studied and had striven to copy either Himself, or  whatsoever seems to us most like Him.  Yes; to study the good, the  beautiful, and the true in Him, and wheresoever else we find it--for all  that is good, beautiful, and true throughout the universe are nought but  rays from Him, the central sun--to obey St. Paul of old, and \"whatsoever  things are true, venerable, just, pure, lovely, and of good report--if  there be any virtue and if there be any praise, to think on these  things,\"--on these scattered fragmentary sacraments of Him whose number  is not two, nor seven, \"but seventy-times seven;\" that is the way--I  think, the only way--to be ready to recognise our Saviour, and to prepare  to meet our God; that He may be to us, too, as a refiner's fire, and  refine us--our thoughts, our deeds, our characters throughout.  And I think, too, that this is the way, perhaps the only way, to rid  ourselves of the fancy that we can be accounted righteous before God for  any works or deservings of our own.  Those in whom that fancy lingers  must have but a paltry standard of what righteousness is, a mean  conception of moral--that is, spiritual--perfection.  But those who look  not inwards, but upwards; not at themselves, but at Christ and all  spiritual perfection--they become more and more painfully aware of their  own imperfections.  The beauty of Christ's character shows them the  ugliness of their own.  His purity shows them their own foulness.  His  love their own hardness.  His wisdom their own folly.  His strength their  own weakness.  The higher their standard rises, the lower falls their  estimate of themselves; till, in utter humiliation and self-distrust,  they seek comfort ere alone it can be found--in FAITH--in utter faith and  trust in that very moral perfection of Christ which shames and dazzles  them, and yet is their only hope.  To trust in Him for themselves and all  they love.  To trust that, just because Christ is so magnificent, He will  pity, and not despise, our meanness.  Just because He is so pure, and  righteous, and true, and lovely, He will appreciate, and not abhor, our  struggles after purity, righteousness, truth, love, however imperfect,  however soiled with failure--and with worse.  Just because He is so  unlike us, He will smile graciously upon out feeblest attempts to be like  Him.  Just because He has borne the sins and carried the sorrows of  mankind, therefore those who come to Him He will in no wise cast out.   Amen.    SERMON V.  ADVENT LESSONS    Westminster Abbey, First Sunday in Advent, 1873.  Romans vii. 22-25.  \"I delight in the law of God after the inward man:   but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,  and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.   O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this  death?  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"  This is the first Sunday in Advent.  To-day we have prayed that God would  give us grace to put away the works of darkness, and put on us the armour  of light.  Next Sunday we shall pray that, by true understanding of the  Scriptures, we may embrace and hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting  life.  The Sunday after that the ministers and stewards of God's  mysteries may prepare His way by turning the hearts of the disobedient to  the wisdom of the just--the next, that His grace and mercy may speedily  help and deliver us from the sins which hinder us in running the race set  before us.  But I do not think that we shall understand those collects,  or indeed the meaning of Advent itself, or the reason why we keep the  season of Advent year by year, unless we first understand the prayer  which we offered up last Sunday, \"Stir up, O Lord, the wills of Thy  faithful people,\"--and we shall understand that prayer just in proportion  as we have in us the Spirit of God, or the spirit of the world, which is  the spirit of unbelief.  Worldly people say--and say openly, just now--that this prayer is all a  dream.  They say God will not stir up men's wills to do good any more  than to do harm.  He leaves men to themselves to get through life as they  can.  This Heavenly Father of whom you speak will not give His holy  spirit to those who ask Him.  He does not, as one of your Collects says,  put into men's minds good desires--they come to a man entirely from  outside a man, from his early teaching, his youthful impressions, as they  are called now-a-days.  He does not either give men grace and power to  put these desires into practice.  That depends entirely on the natural  strength of a man's character; and that, again, depends principally on  the state of his brain.  So, says the world, if you wish your own  character to improve, you must improve it yourself, for God will not  improve it for you.  But, after all, why should you try to improve? why  not be content to be just what you are? you did not make yourself, and  you are not responsible for being merely what God has chosen to make you.  This is what worldly men say, or at least what they believe and act on;  and this is the reason why there is so little improvement in the world,  because men do not ask God to improve their hearts and stir up their  wills.  I say, very little improvement.  Men talk loudly of the  enlightenment of the age, and the progress of the species, and the spread  of civilisation, and so forth:  but when I read old books, and compare  old times with these, I confess I do not see so much of it as all this  hopeful talk would lead me to expect.  Men in general have grown more  prudent, more cunning, from long experience.  They have found out that  certain sins do not pay--that is, they interfere with people's comfort  and their power of making money, and therefore they prudently avoid them  themselves, and put them down by law in other men's cases.  Men have  certainly grown more good-natured, in some countries, in that they  dislike more than their ancestors did, to inflict bodily torture on human  beings; but they are just as ready, or even more ready, to inflict on  those whom they dislike that moral and mental torture which to noble  souls is worse than any bodily pain.  As for any real improvement in  human nature--where is it?  There is just as much falsehood, cheating,  and covetousness, I believe, in the world as ever there was; just as much  cant and hypocrisy, and perhaps more; just as much envy, hatred, malice  and all uncharitableness.  Is not the condition of the masses in many  great cities as degraded and as sad as ever was that of the serfs in the  middle ages?  Do not the poor still die by tens of thousands of fevers,  choleras, and other diseases, which we know perfectly how to prevent, and  yet have not the will to prevent?  Is not the adulteration of food just  now as scandalous as it is unchecked?  The sins and follies of human  nature have been repressed in one direction only to break out another.   And as for open and coarse sin, people complain even now, and I fear with  justice, that there is more drunkenness in England at this moment than  there ever was.  So much for our boasted improvement.  Look again at the wars of the world.  Five-and-twenty years ago, one used  to be told that the human race was grown too wise to go to war any more,  and that we were to have an advent of universal peace and plenty, and  since then we have seen some seven great wars, the last the most terrible  of all,--and ever since, all the nations of Europe have been watching  each other in distrust and dread, increasing their armaments, working  often night and day at forging improved engines of destruction, wherewith  to kill their fellow-men.  Not that I blame that.  It is necessary.  Yes!  but the hideous thing is, that it should be necessary.  Does that state  of things look much like progress of the human race?"]]]
