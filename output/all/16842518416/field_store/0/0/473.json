I only happened--\"  Remembering suddenly that what he had happened to do was to drop a cannonball (the school weight) on the form-room floor, not once, but on several occasions, he paused.  \"'French bad; conduct disgraceful--'\"  \"Everybody rags in French.\"  \"'Mathematics bad. Inattentive and idle.'\"  \"Nobody does much work in Math.\"  \"'Latin poor. Greek, very poor.'\"  \"We were doing Thucydides, Book Two, last term--all speeches and doubtful readings, and cruxes and things--beastly hard! Everybody says so.\"  \"Here are Mr. Appleby's remarks: 'The boy has genuine ability, which he declines to use in the smallest degree.'\"  Mike moaned a moan of righteous indignation.  \"'An abnormal proficiency at games has apparently destroyed all desire in him to realize the more serious issues of life.' There is more to the same effect.\"  Mr. Appleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted a public-school master's duties. As a man he was distinctly pro-Mike. He understood cricket, and some of Mike's strokes on the off gave him thrills of pure aesthetic joy; but as a master he always made it his habit to regard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an unbiased eye, and to an unbiased eye Mike in a form room was about as near the extreme edge as a boy could be, and Mr. Appleby said as much in a clear firm hand.  \"You remember what I said to you about your report at Christmas, Mike?\" said Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal document and replacing it in its envelope.  Mike said nothing; there was a sinking feeling in his interior.  \"I shall abide by what I said.\"  Mike's heart thumped.  \"You will not go back to Wrykyn next term.\"  Somewhere in the world the sun was shining, birds were twittering; somewhere in the world lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at their toil (flat, perhaps, but still blithely), but to Mike at that moment the sky was black, and an icy wind blew over the face of the earth.  The tragedy had happened, and there was an end of it. He made no attempt to appeal against the sentence. He knew it would be useless, his father, when he made up his mind, having all the unbending tenacity of the normally easygoing man.  Mr. Jackson was sorry for Mike. He understood him, and for that reason he said very little now.  \"I am sending you to Sedleigh,\" was his next remark.  Sedleigh! Mike sat up with a jerk. He knew Sedleigh by name--one of those schools with about a hundred boys which you never hear of except when they send up their gym team to Aldershot, or their Eight to Bisley. Mike's outlook on life was that of a cricketer, pure and simple. What had Sedleigh ever done? What were they ever likely to do? Whom did they play? What Old Sedleighan had ever done anything at cricket? Perhaps they didn't even _play_ cricket!  \"But it's an awful hole,\" he said blankly.  Mr. Jackson could read Mike's mind like a book. Mike's point of view was plain to him. He did not approve of it, but he knew that in Mike's place and at Mike's age he would have felt the same. He spoke dryly to hide his sympathy.  \"It is not a large school,\" he said, \"and I don't suppose it could play Wrykyn at cricket, but it has one merit--boys work there. Young Barlitt won a Balliol scholarship from Sedleigh last year.\" Barlitt was the vicar's son, a silent, spectacled youth who did not enter very largely into Mike's world. They had met occasionally at tennis parties, but not much conversation had ensued. Barlitt's mind was massive, but his topics of conversation were not Mike's.  \"Mr. Barlitt speaks very highly of Sedleigh,\" added Mr. Jackson.  Mike said nothing, which was a good deal better than saying what he would have liked to have said.    2  SEDLEIGH   The train, which had been stopping everywhere for the last half hour, pulled up again, and Mike, seeing the name of the station, got up, opened the door, and hurled a bag out on to the platform in an emphatic and vindictive manner. Then he got out himself and looked about him.  \"For the school, sir?\" inquired the solitary porter, bustling up, as if he hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveler into thinking that Sedleigh station was staffed by a great army of porters.  Mike nodded. A somber nod. The nod Napoleon might have given if somebody had met him in 1812, and said, \"So you're back from Moscow, eh?\" Mike was feeling thoroughly jaundiced. The future seemed wholly gloomy. And, so far from attempting to make the best of things, he had set himself deliberately to look on the dark side. He thought, for instance, that he had never seen a more repulsive porter, or one more obviously incompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the luggage van. He disliked his voice, his appearance, and the color of his hair. Also the boots he wore. He hated the station, and the man who took his ticket.  \"Young gents at the school, sir,\" said the porter, perceiving from Mike's _distrait_ air that the boy was a stranger to the place, \"goes up in the bus mostly. It's waiting here, sir. Hi, George!\"  \"I'll walk, thanks,\" said Mike frigidly.  \"It's a goodish step, sir.\"  \"Here you are.\"  \"Thank you, sir. I'll send up your luggage by the bus, sir. Which 'ouse was it you was going to?\"  \"Outwood's.\"  \"Right, sir. It's straight on up this road to the school. You can't miss it, sir.\"  \"Worse luck,\" said Mike.  He walked off up the road, sorrier for himself than ever. It was such absolutely rotten luck. About now, instead of being on his way to a place where they probably ran a Halma team instead of a cricket eleven, and played hunt-the-slipper in winter, he would be on the point of arriving at Wrykyn. And as captain of cricket, at that. Which was the bitter part of it. He had never been in command. For the last two seasons he had been the star man, going in first, and heading the averages easily at the end of the season; and the three captains under whom he had played during his career as a Wrykynian, Burgess, Enderby, and Henfrey, had always been sportsmen to him. But it was not the same thing. He had meant to do such a lot for Wrykyn cricket this term. He had had an entirely new system of coaching in his mind. Now it might never be used. He had handed it on in a letter to Strachan, who would be captain in his place; but probably Strachan would have some scheme of his own. There is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way; and there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricket coaching at school.  Wrykyn, too, would be weak this year, now that he was no longer there. Strachan was a good, free bat on his day, and, if he survived a few overs, might make a century in an hour, but he was not to be depended upon. There was no doubt that Mike's sudden withdrawal meant that Wrykyn would have a bad time that season. And it had been such a wretched athletic year for the school. The football fifteen had been hopeless, and had lost both the Ripton matches, the return by over sixty points. Sheen's victory in the light weights at Aldershot had been their one success. And now, on top of all this, the captain of cricket was removed during the Easter holidays. Mike's heart bled for Wrykyn, and he found himself loathing Sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing.  The only thing he could find in its favor was the fact that it was set in a very pretty country. Of a different type from the Wrykyn country, but almost as good. For three miles Mike made his way through woods and past fields. Once he crossed a river. It was soon after this that he caught sight, from the top of a hill, of a group of buildings that wore an unmistakably schoollike look.  This must be Sedleigh.  Ten minutes' walk brought him to the school gates, and a baker's boy directed him to Mr. Outwood's.  There were three houses in a row, separated from the school buildings by a cricket field. Outwood's was the middle one of these.  Mike went to the front door and knocked. At Wrykyn he had always charged in at the beginning of term at the boys' entrance, but this formal reporting of himself at Sedleigh suited his mood.  He inquired for Mr. Outwood, and was shown into a room lined with books. Presently the door opened, and the housemaster appeared.  There was something pleasant and homely about Mr. Outwood. In appearance he reminded Mike of Smee in _Peter Pan_. He had the same eyebrows and pince-nez and the same motherly look.  \"Jackson?\" he said mildly.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I am very glad to see you, very glad indeed. Perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey. I think you might like a cup of tea. You come from Crofton, in Shropshire, I understand, Jackson, near Brindleford? It is a part of the country which I have always wished to visit. I dare say you have frequently seen the Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose at Brindleford?\"  Mike, who would not have recognized a Cluniac Priory if you had handed him one on a tray, said he had not.  \"Dear me! You have missed an opportunity which I should have been glad to have. I am preparing a book on Ruined Abbeys and Priories of England, and it has always been my wish to see the Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose. A deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century. Bishop Geoffrey, 1133-40--\"  \"Shall I go across to the boys' part, sir?\"  \"What? Yes. Oh, yes. Quite so. And perhaps you would like a cup of tea after your journey? No? Quite so. Quite so. You should make a point of visiting the remains of the Cluniac Priory in the summer holidays, Jackson. You will find the matron in her room. In many respects it is unique. The northern altar is in a state of really wonderful preservation. It consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long and two and a half wide, with chamfered plinth, standing quite free"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],["title","Mike and Psmith (#2)"],["body","the apse wall. It will well repay a visit. Good-bye for the present, Jackson, good-bye.\"  Mike wandered across to the other side of the house, his gloom visibly deepened. All alone in a strange school, where they probably played hopscotch, with a housemaster who offered one cups of tea after one's journey and talked about chamfered plinths and apses. It was a little hard.  He strayed about, finding his bearings, and finally came to a room which he took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a Wrykyn house. Everywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness. Evidently he had come by an earlier train than was usual. But this room was occupied.  A very long, thin youth, with a solemn face and immaculate clothes, was leaning against the mantelpiece. As Mike entered, he fumbled in his top left waistcoat pocket, produced an eyeglass attached to a cord, and fixed it in his right eye. With the help of this aid to vision he inspected Mike in silence for a while, then, having flicked an invisible speck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat, he spoke.  \"Hello,\" he said.  He spoke in a tired voice.  \"Hello,\" said Mike.  \"Take a seat,\" said the immaculate one. \"If you don't mind dirtying your bags, that's to say. Personally, I don't see any prospect of ever sitting down in this place. It looks to me as if they meant to use these chairs as mustard-and-cress beds. A Nursery Garden in the Home. That sort of idea. My name,\" he added pensively, \"is Smith. What's yours?\"    3  PSMITH   \"Jackson,\" said Mike.  \"Are you the Bully, the Pride of the School, or the Boy who is Led Astray and takes to Drink in Chapter Sixteen?\"  \"The last, for choice,\" said Mike, \"but I've only just arrived, so I don't know.\"  \"The boy--what will he become? Are you new here, too, then?\"  \"Yes! Why, are you new?\"  \"Do I look as if I belonged here? I'm the latest import. Sit down on yonder settee, and I will tell you the painful story of my life. By the way, before I start, there's just one thing. If you ever have occasion to write to me, would you mind sticking a P at the beginning of my name? P-s-m-i-t-h. See? There are too many Smiths, and I don't care for Smythe. My father's content to worry along in the old-fashioned way, but I've decided to strike out a fresh line. I shall found a new dynasty. The resolve came to me unexpectedly this morning. I jotted it down on the back of an envelope. In conversation you may address me as Rupert (though I hope you won't), or simply Smith, the _P_ not being sounded. Compare the name Zbysco, in which the Z is given a similar miss-in-balk. See?\"  Mike said he saw. Psmith thanked him with a certain stately old world courtesy.  \"Let us start at the beginning,\" he resumed. \"My infancy. When I was but a babe, my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling an hour by my nurse to keep an eye on me, and see that I did not raise Cain. At the end of the first day she struck for one-and-six, and got it. We now pass to my boyhood. At an early age, I was sent to Eton, everybody predicting a bright career for me. But,\" said Psmith solemnly, fixing an owl-like gaze on Mike through the eyeglass, \"it was not to be.\"  \"No?\" said Mike.  \"No. I was superannuated last term.\"  \"Bad luck.\"  \"For Eton, yes. But what Eton loses, Sedleigh gains.\"  \"But why Sedleigh, of all places?\"  \"This is the most painful part of my narrative. It seems that a certain scug in the next village to ours happened last year to collar a Balliol--\"  \"Not Barlitt!\" exclaimed Mike.  \"That was the man. The son of the vicar. The vicar told the curate, who told our curate, who told our vicar, who told my father, who sent me off here to get a Balliol too. Do _you_ know Barlitt?\"  \"His father's vicar of our village. It was because his son got a Balliol that I was sent here.\"  \"Do you come from Crofton?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I've lived at Lower Benford all my life. We are practically long-lost brothers. Cheer a little, will you?\"  Mike felt as Robinson Crusoe felt when he met Friday. Here was a fellow human being in this desert place. He could almost have embraced Psmith. The very sound of the name Lower Benford was heartening. His dislike for his new school was not diminished, but now he felt that life there might at least be tolerable.  \"Where were you before you came here?\" asked Psmith. \"You have heard my painful story. Now tell me yours.\"  \"Wrykyn. My father took me away because I got such a lot of bad reports.\"  \"My reports from Eton were simply scurrilous. There's a libel action in every sentence. How do you like this place, from what you've seen of it?\"  \"Rotten.\"  \"I am with you, Comrade Jackson. You won't mind my calling you Comrade, will you? I've just become a socialist. It's a great scheme. You ought to be one. You work for the equal distribution of property, and start by collaring all you can and sitting on it. We must stick together. We are companions in misfortune. Lost lambs. Sheep that have gone astray. Divided, we fall, together we may worry through. Have you seen Professor Radium yet? I should say Mr. Outwood. What do you think of him?\"  \"He doesn't seem a bad sort of chap. Bit off his nut. Jawed about apses and things.\"  \"And thereby,\" said Psmith, \"hangs a tale. I've been making inquiries of a stout sportsman in a sort of Salvation Army uniform, whom I met in the grounds--he's the school sergeant or something, quite a solid man--and I hear that Comrade Outwood's an archaeological cove. Goes about the country beating up old ruins and fossils and things. There's an Archaeological Society in the school, run by him. It goes out on half-holidays, prowling about, and is allowed to break bounds and generally steep itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry. And, mark you, laddie, if you belong to the Archaeological Society you get off cricket. To get off cricket,\" said Psmith, dusting his right trouser leg, \"was the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years. A noble game, but a bit too thick for me. At Eton I used to have to field out at the nets till the soles of my boots wore through. I suppose you are a blood at the game? Play for the school against Loamshire, and so on.\"  \"I'm not going to play here, at any rate,\" said Mike.  He had made up his mind on this point in the train. There is a certain fascination about making the very worst of a bad job. Achilles knew his business when he sat in his tent. The determination not to play cricket for Sedleigh as he could not play for Wrykyn gave Mike a sort of pleasure. To stand by with folded arms and a somber frown, as it were, was one way of treating the situation, and one not without its meed of comfort.  Psmith approved the resolve.  \"Stout fellow,\" he said. \"'Tis well. You and I, hand in hand, will search the countryside for ruined abbeys. We will snare the elusive fossil together. Above all, we will go out of bounds. We shall thus improve our minds, and have a jolly good time as well. I shouldn't wonder if one mightn't borrow a gun from some friendly native, and do a bit of rabbit shooting here and there. From what I saw of Comrade Outwood during our brief interview, I shouldn't think he was one of the lynx-eyed contingent. With tact we ought to be able to slip away from the merry throng of fossil chasers, and do a bit on our own account.\"  \"Good idea,\" said Mike. \"We will. A chap at Wrykyn, called Wyatt, used to break out at night and shoot at cats with an air pistol.\"  \"It would take a lot to make me do that. I am all against anything that interferes with my sleep. But rabbits in the daytime is a scheme. We'll nose about for a gun at the earliest opp. Meanwhile we'd better go up to Comrade Outwood, and get our names shoved down for the Society.\"  \"I vote we get some tea first somewhere.\"  \"Then let's beat up a study. I suppose they have studies here. Let's go and look.\"  They went upstairs. On the first floor there was a passage with doors on either side. Psmith opened the first of these.  \"This'll do us well,\" he said.  It was a biggish room, looking out over the school grounds. There were a couple of deal tables, two empty bookcases, and a looking glass, hung on a nail.  \"Might have been made for us,\" said Psmith approvingly.  \"I suppose it belongs to some rotter.\"  \"Not now.\"  \"You aren't going to collar it!\"  \"That,\" said Psmith, looking at himself earnestly in the mirror, and straightening his tie, \"is the exact program. We must stake out our claims. This is practical socialism.\"  \"But the real owner's bound to turn up some time or other.\"  \"His misfortune, not ours. You can't expect two masterminds like us to pig it in that room downstairs. There are moments when one wants to be alone. It is imperative that we have a place to retire to after a fatiguing day. And now, if you want to be really useful, come and help me fetch up my box from downstairs. It's got a gas ring and various things in it.\"    4  STAKING OUT A CLAIM   Psmith, in the matter of decorating a study and preparing tea in it, was rather a critic than an executant. He was full of ideas, but he preferred to allow Mike to carry them out. It was he who suggested that the wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary, but it was Mike who wrenched it from its place. Similarly, it was Mike who abstracted the key from the door of the next study, though the idea was Psmith's.  \"Privacy,\" said Psmith, as he watched Mike light the gas ring, \"is what we chiefly need in this age of publicity. If you leave a study door unlocked in these strenuous times, the first thing you know is, somebody comes right in, sits down, and begins to talk about himself. I think with a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently comfortable. That putrid calendar must come down, though. Do you think you could make a long arm, and haul it off the parent tintack? Thanks. We make progress. We make progress.\"  \"We shall jolly well make it out of the window,\" said Mike, spooning up tea from a paperbag with a postcard, \"if a sort"]]]
