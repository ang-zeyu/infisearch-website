I   When the Presidential campaign was at its height; when in various sections of the United States \"the boy orator of La Platte\" was making invidious remarks concerning the Republican Party, and in Canton (Ohio) Mr. M.A. Hanna was cheerfully expressing his confidence as to the outcome of it all; when the Czar and the Czarina were visiting President Faure in Paris \"amid unparalleled enthusiasm\"; and when semi-educated people were appraising, with a glibness possible to ignorance only, the literary achievements of William Morris and George du Maurier, who had just died:--at this remote time, Roger Stapylton returned to Lichfield.  For in that particular October Patricia's father, an accommodating physician having declared old Roger Stapylton's health to necessitate a Southern sojourn, leased the Bellingham mansion in Lichfield. It happened that, by rare good luck, Tom Bellingham--of the Bellinghams of Assequin, not the Bellinghams of Bellemeade, who indeed immigrated after the War of 1812 and have never been regarded as securely established from a social standpoint,--was at this time in pecuniary difficulties on account of having signed another person's name to a cheque.  Roger Stapylton refurnished the house in the extreme degree of Lichfieldian elegance. Colonel Musgrave was his mentor throughout the process; and the oldest families of Lichfield very shortly sat at table with the former overseer, and not at all unwillingly, since his dinners were excellent and an infatuated Rudolph Musgrave--an axiom now in planning any list of guests,--was very shortly to marry the man's daughter.  In fact, the matter had been settled; and Colonel Musgrave had received from Roger Stapylton an exuberantly granted charter of courtship.  This befell, indeed, upon a red letter day in Roger Stapylton's life. The banker was in business matters wonderfully shrewd, as divers transactions, since the signing of that half-forgotten contract whereby he was to furnish a certain number of mules for the Confederate service, strikingly attested: but he had rarely been out of the country wherein his mother bore him; and where another nabob might have dreamed of an earl, or even have soared aspiringly in imagination toward a marchioness-ship for his only child, old Stapylton retained unshaken faith in the dust-gathering creed of his youth.  He had tolerated Pevensey, had indeed been prepared to purchase him much as he would have ordered any other expensive trinket or knickknack which Patricia desired. But he had never viewed the match with enthusiasm.  Now, though, old Stapylton exulted. His daughter--half a Vartrey already--would become by marriage a Musgrave of Matocton, no less. Pat's carriage would roll up and down the oak-shaded avenue from which he had so often stepped aside with an uncovered head, while gentlemen and ladies cantered by; and it would be Pat's children that would play about the corridors of the old house at whose doors he had lived so long,--those awe-inspiring corridors, which he had very rarely entered, except on Christmas Day and other recognized festivities, when, dressed to the nines, the overseer and his uneasy mother were by immemorial custom made free of the mansion, with every slave upon the big plantation.  \"They were good days, sir,\" he chuckled. \"Heh, we'll stick to the old customs. We'll give a dinner and announce it at dessert, just as your honored grandfather did your Aunt Constantia's betrothal--\"  For about the Musgraves of Matocton there could be no question. It was the old man's delight to induce Rudolph Musgrave to talk concerning his ancestors; and Stapylton soon had their history at his finger-tips. He could have correctly blazoned every tincture in their armorial bearings and have explained the origin of every rampant, counter-changed or couchant beast upon the shield.  He knew it was the _Bona Nova_ in the November of 1619,--for the first Musgrave had settled in Virginia, prior to his removal to Lichfield,--which had the honor of transporting the forebear of this family into America. Stapylton could have told you offhand which scions of the race had represented this or that particular county in the House of Burgesses, and even for what years; which three of them were Governors, and which of them had served as officers of the State Line in the Revolution; and, in fine, was more than satisfied to have his daughter play Penelophon to Colonel Musgrave's debonair mature Cophetua.  In a word, Roger Stapylton had acquiesced to the transferal of his daughter's affections with the peculiar equanimity of a properly reared American parent. He merely stipulated that, since his business affairs prevented an indefinite stay in Lichfield, Colonel Musgrave should presently remove to New York City, where the older man held ready for him a purely ornamental and remunerative position with the Insurance Company of which Roger Stapylton was president.  But upon this point Rudolph Musgrave was obdurate.  He had voiced, and with sincerity, as you may remember, his desire to be proven upon a larger stage than Lichfield afforded. Yet the sincerity was bred of an emotion it did not survive. To-day, unconsciously, Rudolph Musgrave was reflecting that he was used to living in Lichfield, and would appear to disadvantage in a new surrounding, and very probably would not be half so comfortable.  Aloud he said, in firm belief that he spoke truthfully: \"I cannot conscientiously give up the Library, sir. I realize the work may not seem important in your eyes. Indeed, in anybody's eyes it must seem an inadequate outcome of a man's whole life. But it unfortunately happens to be the only kind of work I am capable of doing. And--if you will pardon me, sir,--I do not think it would be honest for me to accept this generous salary and give nothing in return.\"  But here Patricia broke in.  Patricia agreed with Colonel Musgrave in every particular. Indeed, had Colonel Musgrave proclaimed his intention of setting up in life as an assassin, Patricia would readily have asserted homicide to be the most praiseworthy of vocations. As it was, she devoted no little volubility and emphasis and eulogy to the importance of a genealogist in the eternal scheme of things; and gave her father candidly to understand that an inability to appreciate this fact was necessarily indicative of a deplorably low order of intelligence.  Musgrave was to remember--long afterward--how glorious and dear this brightly-colored, mettlesome and tiny woman had seemed to him in the second display of temper he witnessed in Patricia. It was a revelation of an additional and as yet unsuspected adorability.  Her father, though, said: \"Pat, I've suspected for a long time it was foolish of me to have a red-haired daughter.\" Thus he capitulated,--and with an ineffable air of routine.  Colonel Musgrave was, in a decorous fashion, the happiest of living persons.     II   Colonel Musgrave was, in a decorous fashion, the happiest of living persons....  As a token of this he devoted what little ready money he possessed to renovating Matocton, where he had not lived for twenty years. He rarely thought of money, not esteeming it an altogether suitable subject for a gentleman's meditations. And to do him justice, the reflection that old Stapylton's wealth would some day be at Rudolph Musgrave's disposal was never more than an agreeable minor feature of Patricia's entourage whenever, as was very often, Colonel Musgrave fell to thinking of how adorable Patricia was in every particular.  Yet there were times when he thought of Anne Charteris as well. He had not seen her for a whole year now, for the Charterises had left Lichfield shortly after the Pendomer divorce case had been settled, and were still in Europe.  This was the evening during which Roger Stapylton had favorably received his declaration; and Colonel Musgrave was remembering the time that he and Anne had last spoken with a semblance of intimacy--that caustic time when Anne Charteris had interrupted him in high words with her husband, and circumstances had afforded to Rudolph Musgrave no choice save to confess, to this too-perfect woman, of all created beings, his \"true relations\" with Clarice Pendomer.  Even as yet the bitterness of that humiliation was not savorless....  It seemed to him that he could never bear to think of the night when Anne had heard his stammerings through, and had merely listened, and in listening had been unreasonably beautiful. So Godiva might have looked on Peeping Tom, with more of wonder than of loathing, just at first....  It had been very hard to bear. But it seemed necessary. The truth would have hurt Anne too much....  He noted with the gusto of a connoisseur how neatly the d√©nouement of this piteous farce had been prepared. His rage with Charteris; Anne's overhearing, and misinterpretation of, a dozen angry words; that old affair with Clarice--immediately before her marriage (one of how many pleasurable gallantries? the colonel idly wondered, and regretted that he had no Leporello to keep them catalogued for consultation)--and George Pendomer's long-smoldering jealousy of Rudolph Musgrave: all fitted in as neatly as the bits of a puzzle.  It had been the simplest matter in the world to shield John Charteris. Yet, the colonel wished he could be sure it was an unadulterated desire of protecting Anne which had moved him. There had been very certainly an enjoyment all the while in reflecting how nobly Rudolph Musgrave was behaving for the sake of \"the only woman he had ever loved.\" Yes, one had undoubtedly phrased it thus--then, and until the time one met Patricia.  But Anne was different, and in the nature of things must always be a little different, from all other people--even Patricia Stapylton.  Always in reverie the colonel would come back to this,--that Anne could not be thought of, quite, in the same"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10045"],["title","Dave Darrin's Second Year at Annapolis (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Darrin's Blow Knocked the Midshipman Down]     DAVE DARRIN'S SECOND YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS  or  Two Midshipmen as Naval Academy \"Youngsters\"  By  H.

CONCLUSION     CHAPTER I   A QUESTION OF MIDSHIPMAN HONOR  \"How can a midshipman and gentleman act in that way?\"  The voice of Midshipman David Darrin, United States Navy, vibrated uneasily as he turned to his comrades.  \"It's a shame--that's what it is,\" quivered Mr. Farley, also of the third class at the United States Naval Academy.  \"But the question is,\" propounded Midshipman Dan Dalzell, \"what are we going to do about it?\"  \"Is it any part of our business to bother with the fellow?\" demanded Farley half savagely.  Now Farley was rather hot-tempered, though he was \"all there\" in points that involved the honor of the brigade of midshipmen.  Five midshipmen stood in the squalid, ill-odored back room of a Chinese laundry in the town of Annapolis.  There was a sixth midshipman present in the handsome blue uniform of the brigade; and it was upon this sixth one that the anger and disgust of the other five had centered.  He lay in a sleep too deep for stirring. On the still, foul air floated fumes that were new to those of his comrades who now gazed down on him.  \"To think that one of our class could make such a beast of himself!\" sighed Dave Darrin.  \"And on the morning of the very day we're to ship for the summer cruise,\" uttered Farley angrily.  \"Oh, well\" growled Hallam, \"why not let this animal of lower grade sleep just where he is? Let him take what he has fairly brought upon himself!\"  \"That's the very question that is agitating me,\" declared Dave Darrin, to whom these other members of the third class looked as a leader when there was a point involving class honor.  Dave had became a leader through suffering.  Readers of the preceding volume in this series, \"DAVE DARRIN'S FIRST YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS,\" will need no introduction to this fine specimen of spirited and honorable young American.  Readers of that preceding volume will recall how Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell entered the United States Naval Academy, one appointed by a Congressman and the other by a United States Senator. Such readers will remember the difficult time that Dave and Dan had in getting through the work of the first hard, grinding year. They will also recall how Dave Darrin, when accused of treachery to his classmates, patiently bided his time until he, with the aid of some close friends, was able to demonstrate his innocence. Our readers will also remember how two evil-minded members of the then fourth class plotted to increase Damn's disgrace and to drive him out of the brigade; also how these two plotters, Midshipmen Henkel and Brimmer, were caught in their plotting and were themselves forced out of the brigade. Our readers know that before the end of the first year at the Naval Academy, Dave had fully reinstated himself in the esteem of his manly classmates, and how he quickly became the most popular and respected member of his class.  It was now only the day after the events whose narration closed the preceding volume.  Dave Darrin and Dalzell were first of all brought to notice in \"THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' SERIES.\" In their High School days, back in Gridley, these two had been famous members of Dick & Co., a sextette of youngsters who had made a name for themselves in school athletics.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, two other members of the sextette, had been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where they were serving in the corps of cadets and learning how to become Army officers in the not far distant future. All of the adventures of Dick and Greg are set forth in \"THE WEST POINT SERIES.\"  The two remaining members of famous old Dick & Co., Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, became civil engineers, and went West for their first taste of engineering work. Tom and Harry had some wonderful and startling adventures, as fully set forth in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS' SERIES.\"  On this early June day when we again encounter Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell in their handsome Naval uniforms, all members of the first, second and third classes were due to be aboard one of the three great battleships that lay off the Yard at Annapolis at four p.m.  These three great battleships were the \"Massachusetts,\" the \"Iowa\" and the \"Indiana.\" These three huge, turreted fighting craft had their full crews aboard. Not one of the battleship commanders would allow a \"jackie\" ashore, except on business, through fear that many of the \"wilder\" ones might find the attractions on shore too alluring, and fail to return in time.  With the young midshipmen it was different. These young men were officially and actually gentlemen, and could be trusted.  Yet here, in the back room of this laundry, was one who was apparently not dependable.  This young midshipman's name was Pennington, and the fact was that he lay in deep stupor from the effects of smoking opium!  It had been a storekeeper, with a shop across the street, who had called the attention of Dave and his four comrades to the probable fate of another of their class.  \"Chow Hop runs a laundry, but I have heard evil stories about a lot of young fools who flock to his back room and get a chance to 'hit' the opium pipe,\" the storekeeper had stated to Dave. \"One of your men, or at least, one in a midshipman's uniform, went in there at eleven o'clock this forenoon, and he hasn't been out since. It is now nearly two o'clock and, I've been looking for some midshipmen to inform.\"  Such had been the storekeeper's careful statement. The merchants of Annapolis always have a kindly feeling toward these fine young midshipmen. The storekeeper's purpose was to enable them to help their comrade out.  So the five had entered the laundry. The proprietor, Chow Hop, had attempted to bar their way to the rear room.  But Dave had seized the yellow man and had flung him aside.  The reader already knows what they discovered, and how it affected these young men.  \"Bring that copper-colored chink in here, if you'll be so good,\" directed Dave.  Dan and Hallam departed on the quest.  \"You're wanted in there,\" proclaimed Dalzell, jerking a thumb over his shoulder.  \"Me no sabby,\" replied Chow Hop, looking up briefly from his ironing board.  \"Get in there--do you hear?\" commanded Hallam, gripping the other's arm with all his force.  \"You lemme go chop-chop (quickly), or you get alle samee hurt--you sabby?\" scowled Chow Hop, using his free hand to raise a heavy flat-iron menacingly.  But Dan Dalzell jumped in, giving the Chinaman's wrist a wrench that caused him to drop the iron.  Then, without a bit of ceremony, Dan grasped the Oriental by the shoulders, wheeled him about, while he protested in guttural tones, and bluntly kicked the yellow-faced one through the door into the inner room.  At this summary proceeding both the Chinese helpers gripped their flat-irons firmly; and leaped forward to fight.  In an ugly temper the Chinaman is a bad man to oppose. But now this pair were faced by a pair of quietly smiling midshipmen who were also dangerous when angry.  \"You two, get back,\" ordered Dalzell, advancing fearlessly upon the pair. \"If you don't, we'll drag you out into the street and turn you over to the policemen. You 'sabby' that? You heathen are pretty likely to get into prison for this day's work!\"  Scowling for a moment, then muttering savagely, the two helpers slunk back to their ironing boards.  Yet, while Dan turned to go into the rear room, Hallam stood just where he was, to keep an eye on two possible sources of swift trouble.  \"Chow Hop,\" began Dave Damn sternly, as the proprietor made his flying appearance, \"You've done a pretty mean piece of work here\"--pointing to the unconscious midshipman in the berth. \"Do you understand that you're pretty likely to go to prison for this?\"  \"Oh, that no maller,\" replied Chow, with a sullen grin. \"Him plenty 'shipmen come here and smoke.\"  \"You lie!\" hissed Dave, grasping the heathen by the collar and shaking him until the latter's teeth rattled.  Then Dave gave him a brief rest, though he still retained his hold on the Chinaman's collar. But the yellow man began struggling again, and Dave repeated the shaking.  Chow Hop had kept his hands up inside his wide sleeves. Now Farley leaped forward as he shouted:  \"Look out, Darry! He has a knife!\"  Farley attempted to seize the Chinaman's wrist, for the purpose of disarming the yellow man, but Dave swiftly threw the Chinaman around out of Farley's reach. Then, with a lightning-like move, Dave knocked the knife from Chow Hop's hand.  \"Pick that up and keep it for a curio, Farley,\" directed Dave coolly.  In another twinkling Darrin had run the Chinaman up against the wall.  Smack! biff! thump!  With increasing force Dave's hard fist struck the heathen in the face.  \"Now stand there and behave yourself,\" admonished Midshipman Dave, dropping his hold on the yellow man's collar, \"or we'll stop playing with you and hurt you some.\"  The scowl on Chow Hop's face was ominous, but he stood still, glaring at Dave.  \"Chow, what can we do to bring this man out of his sleep!\" asked Dave coolly, and almost in a friendly tone.  \"Me no sabby,\" sulked the Chinaman.  \"Yes, you do,\" retorted Dave"]]]
