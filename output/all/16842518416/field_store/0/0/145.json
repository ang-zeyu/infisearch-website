Something unusual has happened,\" said Mrs. Apollonie significantly.  \"The ghost of Wildenstein might have pushed them open,\" Kurt quickly asserted.  \"Kurt, can't you stop talking about this story? It is only an invention of people who are not contented with one misfortune but must make up an added terror,\" the mother said with animation. \"You know, Kurt, that I feel sorry about this foolish tale and want you to pay no attention to it.\"  \"But mother, I only want to support you; I want to help you get rid of people's superstitions and to prove to them that there is no ghost in Wildenstein,\" Kurt assured her.  \"Yes, yes, if only one did not know how the brothers--\"  \"No, Apollonie,\" the rector's widow interrupted her, \"you least of all should support the belief in these apparitions. Everybody knows that you lived in the castle more than twenty years, and so people think that you know what is going on. You realize well enough that all the talk has no foundation whatever.\"  Mrs. Apollonie lightly shrugged her shoulders, but said no more.  \"But, mother, what can the talk come from then, when there is no foundation for it, as you say?\" asked Kurt, who could not let the matter rest.  \"There is no real foundation for the talk,\" the mother replied, \"and no one of all those who talk has ever seen the apparition with his own eyes. It is always other people who tell, and those have been told again by others, that something uncanny has been seen at the castle. The talk first started from a misfortune which happened years ago, and later on the matter came up and people thought a similar misfortune had taken place again. Although this was an absolutely false report, all the old stories were brought up again and the talk became livelier than ever. But people who know better should be very emphatic in suppressing it.\"  \"What was the misfortune that happened long ago in the castle and then again?\" Kurt asked in great suspense.  \"I have no time to tell you now, Kurt,\" the mother declared decisively. \"You have to attend to your school work and I to other affairs. When I have you all together quietly some evening I shall tell you about those bygone times. It will be better for you to know than to muse about all the reports you hear. You are most active of all in that, Kurt, and I do not like it; so I hope that you will let the matter rest as soon as you have understood how unfounded the talk really is. Come now, Apollonie, and I will give you the plants you wanted. I am so glad to be able to let you have some of my geraniums. You keep your little flower garden in such perfect order that it is a pleasure to see it.\"  During the foregoing speeches Apollonie's face had clearly expressed disagreement with what had been said; she had, however, too much respect for the lady to utter her doubts. Bright sunshine spread itself over her features now, because her flower garden was her greatest pride and joy.  \"Yes, yes, Mrs. Rector, it is a beautiful thing to raise flowers,\" she said, nodding her head. \"They always do their duty, and if one grows a little to one side, I can put a stick beside it and it grows straight again as it ought to. If only the child were like that, then I should have no more cares. But she only has her own ideas in her head, and such strange whims that it would be hard to tell where they come from.\"  \"There is nothing bad about having her own ideas,\" replied the rector's widow. \"It naturally depends on what kind of ideas they are. It seems to me that Loneli is a good-natured child, who is easily led. All children need guidance. What special whims does Loneli have?\"  \"Oh, Mrs. Rector, nobody knows what things the child might do,\" Apollonie said eagerly. \"Yesterday she came home from school with glowing eyes and said to me, 'Grandmother, I should love to go to Spain. Beautiful flowers of all colors grow there and large sparkling grapes, and the sun shines down brightly on the flowers so that they glisten! I wish I could go right away!' Just think of a ten-year-old child saying such a thing. I wonder what to expect next.\"  \"There is nothing very terrible about that, Apollonie,\" said the rector's widow with a smile. \"The child might have heard you mention Spain yourself so that it roused her imagination. She probably heard in school about the country, and her wish to go there only shows that she is extremely attentive. To think out how she might get there some time is a very innocent pleasure, which you can indulge. I agree with you that children should be brought up in a strict and orderly way, because they might otherwise start on the wrong road, and nobody loves such children. But Loneli is not that kind at all. There is no child in Nolla whom I would rather see with my own.\"  Apollonie's honest face glowed anew. \"That is my greatest consolation,\" she said, \"and I need it. Many say to me that an old woman like me is not able to bring up and manage a little child. If you once were obliged to say to me that I had spoiled my grandchild, I should die of shame. But I know that the matter is still well, as long as you like to see the child together with yours. Thank you ever so much now. Those will fill a whole bed,\" she continued, upon receiving a large bunch of plants from her kind friend. \"Please let me know if I can help in any way. I am always at home for you, Mrs. Rector, you know that.\"  Apollonie now said good-bye with renewed thanks. Carrying her large green bundle very carefully in order not to injure the tender little branches, she hurried through the garden towards the castle height. The rector's widow glanced after her thoughtfully. Apollonie was intimately connected with the earliest impressions of her childhood, as well as with the experiences of her youth, with all the people whom she had loved most and who had stood nearest to her. Her appearance therefore always brought up many memories in Mrs. Maxa's heart. Since her husband's death, when she had left the rectory in the valley and had come back to her old home, all her friends called her Mrs. Maxa to distinguish her from the present rector's wife of the village. She had been used to see Apollonie in her parents' house. Baroness Wallerstätten, the mistress of the castle at that time, had often consulted the rector as to many things. Apollonie, a young girl then, had always been her messenger, and everyone liked to see her at the rectory. When it was discovered how quick and able young Apollonie was, things were more and more given into her charge at the castle. The Baroness hardly undertook anything in her household without consulting Apollonie and asking her assistance. The children, who were growing up, also asked many favors from her, which she was ever ready to fulfill. The devoted, faithful servant belonged many years so entirely to the castle that everyone called her \"Castle Apollonie.\"  Mrs. Maxa was suddenly interrupted in her thoughts by loud and repeated calls of \"Mama, Mama!\"  \"Mama!\" it sounded once more from two clear children's voices, and a little boy and girl stood before her. \"The teacher has read us a paper on which was written--\" began the boy.  \"Shall I, too; shall I, too?\" interrupted the girl.  \"Mäzli,\" said the mother, \"let Lippo finish; otherwise I can't understand what you want.\"  \"Mama, the teacher has read us a paper, on which was written that in Sils on the mountain--\"  \"Shall I, too? Shall I, too?\" Mäzli, his sister, interrupted again.  \"Be quiet, Mäzli, till Lippo has finished,\" the mother commanded.  \"He has said the same thing twice already and he is so slow. There has been a fire in Sils on the mountain and we are to send things to the people. Shall I do it, too, Mama, shall I, too?\" Mäzli had told it all in a single breath.  \"You didn't say it right,\" Lippo retorted angrily. \"You didn't start from the beginning. One must not start in the middle, the teacher told us that. Now I'll tell you, Mama. The teacher has read us a paper--\"  \"We know that already, Lippo,\" the mother remarked. \"What was in the paper?\"  \"In the paper was written that a big fire in Sils on the mountain has destroyed two houses and everything in them. Then the teacher said that all the pupils of the class--\"  \"Shall I too, shall I, too?\" Mäzli urged.  \"Finish a little quicker now, Lippo,\" said the mother.  \"Then the teacher said that all the pupils from all the classes must bring some of their things to give to the poor children--\"  \"Shall I too, Mama, shall I go right away and get together all they need?\" Mäzli said rapidly, as if the last moment for action had arrived.  \"Yes, you can give some of your clothes and Lippo can bring some of his,\" the mother said. \"I shall help you, for we have plenty of time. To-morrow is Sunday and the children are sure not to bring their things to school before Monday, as the teacher will want to send them off himself.\"  Lippo agreed and was just beginning to repeat the exact words of the teacher in which he had asked for contributions. But he had no chance to do it.  Kurt came running up at this moment, calling so loudly that nothing else could possibly be heard: \"Mother, I forgot to give you a message. Bruno is not coming home for supper. The Rector is climbing High Ems with him and the two other boys. They will only be home at nine o'clock.\"  The mother looked a little frightened. \"Are the two others his comrades, the Knippel boys?\"  Kurt assented.  \"I hope everything will go well,\" she continued. \"When those three are together outside of school they always quarrel. When we came here first I was so glad that Bruno would have them for friends, but now I am in continual fear that they will clash.\"  \"Yes, mother,\" Kurt asserted, \"you would never have been glad of that friendship if you had really known them. Wherever they can harm anybody they are sure to do it, and always behind people's backs. And Bruno always is like a loaded gun-barrel, just a little spark and he is on fire and explodes.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10142"],["title","Maezli: A Story of the Swiss Valleys (#2)"],["body","\"It is time to go in,\" said the mother now, taking the two youngest by the hand. Kurt followed. It had not escaped him that an expression of sorrow had spread over his mother's face after his words. He hated to see his mother worried.  \"Oh, mother,\" he said confidently, \"there is no reason for you to be upset. If Bruno does anything to them, they are sure to give it back to him in double measure. They'll do it in a sneaky way, because they are afraid of him in the open field.\"  \"Do you really think that this reassures me, Kurt?\" she asked turning towards him. Kurt now realized that his words could not exactly comfort his mother, but he felt that some help should be found, for he was always able to discover such a good side to every evil, that the latter was swallowed up. He saw an advantage now. \"You know, mother, when Bruno has discharged his thunder, it is all over for good. Then he is like a scrubbed out gun-barrel, all clean and polished. Isn't that better than if things would keep sticking there?\"  Mea, standing at the open window, was beckoning to the approaching group with lively gestures; it meant that the time for supper was already overdue. Kurt, rushing to her side, informed her that their mother meant to tell them the story of Wallerstätten as soon as everything was quiet that night and the little ones were put to bed: \"Just mark now if we won't hear about the ghost of Wallerstätten,\" he remarked at the end. Kurt was mistaken, however. Everything was still and quiet long ago, the little ones were in bed and the last lessons were done. But Bruno had not yet returned. Over and over again the mother looked at the clock.  \"You must not be afraid, mother, that they will have a quarrel, because the rector is with them,\" Kurt said consolingly.  Now rapid steps sounded outside, the door was violently flung open and Bruno appeared, pale with rage: \"Those two mean creatures, those malicious rascals; the sneaky hypocrites!--the--the--\"  \"Bruno, no more please,\" the mother interrupted. \"You are beside yourself. Come sit down with us and tell us what happened as soon as you feel more quiet; but no more such words, please.\"  It took a considerable time before Bruno could tell his experience without breaking out again. He told them finally that the rector had mentioned the castle of High Ems in their lessons that day. After asking his pupils if they had ever inspected the famous ruins they had all said no, so the rector invited the three big boys to join him in a walk to see the castle. It was quite a distance away and they had examined the ruins very thoroughly. Afterwards the rector had taken them to a neighboring inn for a treat, so that it was dark already when they were walking down the village street. \"Just where the footpath, which comes from the large farmhouse crosses the road,\" Bruno continued, \"Loneli came running along with a full milk-bottle in her arm. That scoundrel Edwin quickly put out his foot in front of her and Loneli fell down her whole length; the milk bottle flew far off and the milk poured down the road like a small white stream. The boys nearly choked with laughter and all I was able to do was to give Edwin a sound box on the ear,\" Bruno concluded, nearly boiling with rage. \"Such a coward! He ran right off after the Rector, who had gone ahead and had not seen it. Loneli went silently away, crying to herself. I'd like to have taken hold of both of them and given them proper--\"  \"Yes, and Loneli is sure to be scolded by her grandmother for having spilled the milk,\" Mea interrupted; \"she always thinks that Loneli is careless and that it is always her own fault when somebody harms her. She is always punished for the slightest little fault.\"  \"But she never defends herself,\" Kurt said, half in anger, partly with pity. \"If those two ever tried to harm Clevi, they would soon get their faces scratched; Apollonie has brought Loneli up the wrong way.\"  \"Should you like to see Loneli jump at a boy's face and scratch it, Kurt?\" asked the mother.  After meditating a while Kurt replied, \"I guess I really shouldn't.\"  \"Don't you all like Loneli because she never gets rough and always is friendly, obliging and cheerful? Her grandmother really loves her very much; but she is a very honest woman and worries about the child just because she is anxious to bring her up well. I should be extremely sorry if she scolded Loneli in the first excitement about the spilled milk. The boys should have gotten the blame, and I am sure that Apollonie will be sorry if she hears later on what really happened.\"  \"I'll quickly run over and tell her about it,\" Kurt suggested. The mother explained to him, however, that grandmother and grandchild were probably fast asleep by that time.  \"Are we going to have the story of Castle Wildenstein for a finish now?\" he inquired. But his mother had already risen, pointing to the wall clock, and Kurt saw that the usual time for going to bed had passed. As the following day was a Sunday, he was satisfied. They generally had quiet evenings then and there would be no interruptions to the story. Bruno, too, had now calmed down. It had softened him that his mother had found the Knippel boys' behaviour contemptible and that she had not excused them in the least. He might have told the Rector about it, but such accusations he despised. He felt quite appeased since his mother had shared his indignation and knew about the matter. Soon the house lay peacefully slumbering under the fragrant apple trees. The golden moon above was going her way and seemed to look down with friendly eyes, as if she was gratified that the house, which was filled all day with such noise and lively movement, was standing there so calm and peaceful.    CHAPTER II  DIVERS WORRIES  Before the mother went off to church on Sunday morning she always glanced into the living-room to see if the children were quietly settled at their different occupations and to hope that everything would remain in order during her absence. When she looked in to-day everything was peaceful. Bruno and Mea were both sitting in a corner lost in a book, Kurt had spread out his drawings on a table before him, and Lippo and Mäzli were building on their small table a beautiful town with churches, towers and large palaces. The mother was thoroughly satisfied and went away. For awhile everything was still. A bright ray of sunshine fell over Kurt's drawing and gaily played about on the paper. Kurt, looking up, saw how the meadows were sparkling outside.  \"The two rascally milk-spillers from yesterday ought to be locked up for the whole day,\" Kurt suddenly exploded.  Mea apparently had been busy with the same thought for she assented very eagerly. The two talked over the whole affair anew and had to give vent to their indignation about the scoundrels and their pity for poor Loneli. Mäzli must have found the conversation entertaining, for glancing over to the others, she let Lippo place the blocks whichever way he pleased, something that very seldom happened. Only when the children said no more she came back to her task.  \"Goodness gracious!\" Kurt exclaimed suddenly, starting up from his drawing; \"you ought to have reminded me, Mea, that we have to bring some clothes to school for the poor people whose houses were burnt up. You heard it, but mother does not even know about it yet.\"  \"I forgot it, too,\" said Mea quietly, continuing to read.  \"Mother knows about it long ago. I told her right away,\" Lippo declared. \"Teacher told us to be sure not to forget.\"  \"Quite right, little school fox,\" Kurt replied, while he calmly kept on drawing. As long as his mother knew about the matter he did not need to bother any more.  But the last words had interested Mäzli very much. Throwing together the houses, towers and churches she said to Lippo, \"Come, Lippo, I know something amusing we can do which will please mama, too.\"  Lippo wondered what that could be, but he first laid every block neatly away in the big box and did not let Mäzli hurry him in the least.  \"Don't do it that way,\" Mäzli called out impatiently. \"Throw them all in and put on the lid. Then it's all done.\"  \"One must not do that, Mäzli; no one must do it that way,\" Lippo said seriously. \"One ought to put in the first block and pack it before one takes up the second.\"  \"Then I won't wait for you,\" Mäzli declared, rapidly whisking out by the door.  When Lippo had properly filled the box and set it in its right place, he quickly followed Mäzli, wondering what her plan was. But he could find her nowhere, neither in the hall nor in the garden, and he got no answer to his loud, repeated calls. Finally a reply came which sounded strangely muffled, as if from up above, so he went up and into her bedroom. There Mäzli was sitting in the middle of a heap of clothes, her head thrust far into a wardrobe. Apparently she was still pulling out more things.  \"You certainly are doing something wonderful,\" said Lippo, glancing with his big eyes at the clothes on the floor.  \"I am doing the right thing,\" said Mäzli now in the most decided tone. \"Kurt has said that we must send the poor people some clothes, so we must take them all out and lay together everything we don't need any more. Mama will be glad when she has no more to do about it and they can be sent away to-morrow. Now get your things, too, and we'll put them all in a heap.\"  The matter, however, seemed still rather doubtful to Lippo. Standing thoughtfully before all the little skirts and jackets, he felt that this would not be quite after his mother's wish.  \"When we want to do something with our clothes, we always have to ask mother,\" he began again.  But Mäzli did not answer and only pulled out a bunch of woolen stockings and a heavy winter cloak, spreading everything on the floor.  \"No, I won't do it,\" said Lippo again, after scrutinizing the unusual performance.  \"You don't want to do it because you are afraid it will be too much work,\" Mäzli asserted with a"]]]
