I am the one who both keys had in keeping     Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro     So softly in unlocking and in locking,  That from his secrets most men I withheld;     Fidelity I bore the glorious office     So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.  The courtesan who never from the dwelling     Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,     Death universal and the vice of courts,  Inflamed against me all the other minds,     And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,     That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.  My spirit, in disdainful exultation,     Thinking by dying to escape disdain,     Made me unjust against myself, the just.  I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,     Do swear to you that never broke I faith     Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;  And to the world if one of you return,     Let him my memory comfort, which is lying     Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”  Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”     The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,     But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”  Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire     Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;     For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.”  Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man     Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,     Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased  To tell us in what way the soul is bound     Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,     If any from such members e’er is freed.”  Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward     The wind was into such a voice converted:     “With brevity shall be replied to you.  When the exasperated soul abandons     The body whence it rent itself away,     Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.  It falls into the forest, and no part     Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,     There like a grain of spelt it germinates.  It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;     The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,     Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.  Like others for our spoils shall we return;     But not that any one may them revest,     For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.  Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal     Forest our bodies shall suspended be,     Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”  We were attentive still unto the trunk,     Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,     When by a tumult we were overtaken,  In the same way as he is who perceives     The boar and chase approaching to his stand,     Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;  And two behold! upon our left-hand side,     Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,     That of the forest, every fan they broke.  He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”     And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,     Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert  Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”     And then, perchance because his breath was failing,     He grouped himself together with a bush.  Behind them was the forest full of black     She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot     As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.  On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,     And him they lacerated piece by piece,     Thereafter bore away those aching members.  Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,     And led me to the bush, that all in vain     Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.  “O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,     What helped it thee of me to make a screen?     What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”  When near him had the Master stayed his steps,     He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many     Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”  And he to us: “O souls, that hither come     To look upon the shameful massacre     That has so rent away from me my leaves,  Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;     I of that city was which to the Baptist     Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this  Forever with his art will make it sad.     And were it not that on the pass of Arno     Some glimpses of him are remaining still,  Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it     Upon the ashes left by Attila,     In vain had caused their labour to be done.  Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”     Inferno: Canto XIV   Because the charity of my native place     Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,     And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.  Then came we to the confine, where disparted     The second round is from the third, and where     A horrible form of Justice is beheld.  Clearly to manifest these novel things,     I say that we arrived upon a plain,     Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;  The dolorous forest is a garland to it     All round about, as the sad moat to that;     There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.  The soil was of an arid and thick sand,     Not of another fashion made than that     Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.  Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou     By each one to be dreaded, who doth read     That which was manifest unto mine eyes!  Of naked souls beheld I many herds,     Who all were weeping very miserably,     And over them seemed set a law diverse.  Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;     And some were sitting all drawn up together,     And others went about continually.  Those who were going round were far the more,     And those were less who lay down to their torment,     But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.  O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,     Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,     As of the snow on Alp without a wind.  As Alexander, in those torrid parts     Of India, beheld upon his host     Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.  Whence he provided with his phalanxes     To trample down the soil, because the vapour     Better extinguished was while it was single;  Thus was descending the eternal heat,     Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder     Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.  Without repose forever was the dance     Of miserable hands, now there, now here,     Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.  “Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest     All things except the demons dire, that issued     Against us at the entrance of the gate,  Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not     The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,     So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”  And he himself, who had become aware     That I was questioning my Guide about him,     Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead.  If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom     He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,     Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,  And if he wearied out by turns the others     In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,     Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’  Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,     And shot his bolts at me with all his might,     He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”  Then did my Leader speak with such great force,     That I had never heard him speak so loud:     “O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished  Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;     Not any torment, saving thine own rage,     Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”  Then he turned round to me with better lip,     Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he     Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold  God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;     But, as I said to him, his own despites     Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.  Now follow me, and mind thou do not place     As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,     But always keep them close unto the wood.”  Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes     Forth from the wood a little rivulet,     Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.  As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,     The sinful women later share among them,     So downward through the sand it went its way.  The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,     Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;     Whence I perceived that there the passage was.  “In all the rest which I have shown to thee     Since we have entered in within the gate     Whose threshold unto no one is denied,  Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes     So notable as is the present river,     Which all the little flames above it quenches.”  These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him     That he would give me largess of the food,     For which he had given me largess of desire.  “In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”     Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,     Under whose king the world of old was chaste.  There is a mountain there, that once was glad     With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;     Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.  Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle     Of her own son; and to conceal him better,     Whene’er he cried, she there had clamours made.  A grand old man stands in the mount erect,     Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,     And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.  His head is fashioned of refined gold,     And of pure silver are the arms and breast;     Then he is brass as far down as the fork.  From that point downward all is chosen iron,     Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,     And more he stands on that than on the other.  Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure     Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,     Which gathered together perforate that cavern.  From rock to rock they fall into this valley;     Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;     Then downward go along this narrow sluice  Unto that point where is no more descending.     They form Cocytus; what that pool may be     Thou shalt behold, so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1002"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Purgatory (#0)"],["body","Divine Comedy  of Dante Alighieri  Translated by HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW  PURGATORIO   Contents  I.

Purgatorio: Canto I   To run o’er better waters hoists its sail     The little vessel of my genius now,     That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;  And of that second kingdom will I sing     Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,     And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.  But let dead Poesy here rise again,     O holy Muses, since that I am yours,     And here Calliope somewhat ascend,  My song accompanying with that sound,     Of which the miserable magpies felt     The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.  Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,     That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect     Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,  Unto mine eyes did recommence delight     Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,     Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.  The beauteous planet, that to love incites,     Was making all the orient to laugh,     Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.  To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind     Upon the other pole, and saw four stars     Ne’er seen before save by the primal people.  Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.     O thou septentrional and widowed site,     Because thou art deprived of seeing these!  When from regarding them I had withdrawn,     Turning a little to the other pole,     There where the Wain had disappeared already,  I saw beside me an old man alone,     Worthy of so much reverence in his look,     That more owes not to father any son.  A long beard and with white hair intermingled     He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,     Of which a double list fell on his breast.  The rays of the four consecrated stars     Did so adorn his countenance with light,     That him I saw as were the sun before him.  “Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,     Have fled away from the eternal prison?”     Moving those venerable plumes, he said:  “Who guided you? or who has been your lamp     In issuing forth out of the night profound,     That ever black makes the infernal valley?  The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?     Or is there changed in heaven some council new,     That being damned ye come unto my crags?”  Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,     And with his words, and with his hands and signs,     Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;  Then answered him: “I came not of myself;     A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers     I aided this one with my company.  But since it is thy will more be unfolded     Of our condition, how it truly is,     Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.  This one has never his last evening seen,     But by his folly was so near to it     That very little time was there to turn.  As I have said, I unto him was sent     To rescue him, and other way was none     Than this to which I have myself betaken.  I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,     And now those spirits I intend to show     Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.  How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.     Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me     To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.  Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;     He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,     As knoweth he who life for her refuses.  Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter     Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave     The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.  By us the eternal edicts are not broken;     Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;     But of that circle I, where are the chaste  Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,     O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;     For her love, then, incline thyself to us.  Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;     I will take back this grace from thee to her,     If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”  “Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes     While I was on the other side,” then said he,     “That every grace she wished of me I granted;  Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,     She can no longer move me, by that law     Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.  But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,     As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;     Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.  Go, then, and see thou gird this one about     With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,     So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,  For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast     By any mist should go before the first     Angel, who is of those of Paradise.  This little island round about its base     Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,     Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;  No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,     Or that doth indurate, can there have life,     Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.  Thereafter be not this way your return;     The sun, which now is rising, will direct you     To take the mount by easier ascent.”  With this he vanished; and I raised me up     Without a word, and wholly drew myself     Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.  And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;     Let us turn back, for on this side declines     The plain unto its lower boundaries.”  The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour     Which fled before it, so that from afar     I recognised the trembling of the sea.  Along the solitary plain we went     As one who unto the lost road returns,     And till he finds it seems to go in vain.  As soon as we were come to where the dew     Fights with the sun, and, being in a part     Where shadow falls, little evaporates,  Both of his hands upon the grass outspread     In gentle manner did my Master place;     Whence I, who of his action was aware,  Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;     There did he make in me uncovered wholly     That hue which Hell had covered up in me.  Then came we down upon the desert shore     Which never yet saw navigate its waters     Any that afterward had known return.  There he begirt me as the other pleased;     O marvellous! for even as he culled     The humble plant, such it sprang up again  Suddenly there where he uprooted it.     Purgatorio: Canto II   Already had the sun the horizon reached     Whose circle of meridian covers o’er     Jerusalem with its most lofty point,  And night that opposite to him revolves     Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales     That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;  So that the white and the vermilion cheeks     Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,     By too great age were changing into orange.  We still were on the border of the sea,     Like people who are thinking of their road,     Who go in heart and with the body stay;  And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,     Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red     Down in the West upon the ocean floor,  Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—     A light along the sea so swiftly coming,     Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;  From which when I a little had withdrawn     Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,     Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.  Then on each side of it appeared to me     I knew not what of white, and underneath it     Little by little there came forth another.  My Master yet had uttered not"]]]
