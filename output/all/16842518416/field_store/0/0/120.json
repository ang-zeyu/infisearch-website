But where, oh where?  Not in the world around, strewed  with unholiness.  Not in myself--unholy too, without and within--seeming  to myself sometimes the very worst company of all the bad company I meet,  because it is the only bad company from which I cannot escape.  Oh, is  there a Holy One, whom I may contemplate with utter delight? and if so,  where is He?  Oh, that I might behold, if but for a moment, His perfect  beauty, even though, as in the fable of Semele of old, the lightning of  His glance were death.  Nay, more, has it not happened to some here--to  clergyman, lawyer, physician, perhaps, alas! to some pure-minded, noble- hearted woman--to be brought in contact perforce with that which truly  sickens them--with some case of human folly, baseness, foulness--which,  however much their soul revolts from it, they must handle, they must toil  over many weeks and months, in hope that that which is crooked may be  made somewhat straight, till their whole soul was distempered, all but  degraded, by the continual sight of sin, till their eyes seemed full of  nothing but the dance of death, and their ears of the gibbering of  madmen, and their nostrils with the odours of the charnel house, and they  longed for one breath of pure air, one gleam of pure light, one strain of  pure music, to wash their spirits clean from those foul elements into  which their duty had thrust them down perforce?  And then, oh then, has there not come to such an one--I know that it has  come--that for which his spirit was athirst, the very breath of pure air,  the very gleam of pure light, the very strain of pure music, for it is  the very music of the spheres, in those same words, \"Holy, holy, holy,  Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come;\" and he has  answered, with a flush of keenest joy, Yes.  Whatever else is unholy,  there is an Holy One, spotless and undefiled, serene and self-contained.   Whatever else I cannot trust, there is One whom I can trust utterly.   Whatever else I am dissatisfied with, there is One whom I can contemplate  with utter satisfaction, and bathe my stained soul in that eternal fount  of purity.  And who is He?  Who save the Cause and Maker, and Ruler of  all things, past, present, and to come?  Ah, Gospel of all gospels, that  God Himself, the Almighty God, is the eternal and unchangeable  realisation of all that I and all mankind, in our purest and our noblest  moments, have ever dreamed concerning the true, the beautiful, and the  good.  Even though He slay me, the unholy, yet will I trust in Him.  For  He is Holy, Holy, Holy, and can do nothing to me, or any creature, save  what He OUGHT.  For He has created all things, and for His pleasure they  are and were created.  Whosoever has entered, though but for a moment, however faintly,  partially, stupidly, into that thought of thoughts, has entered in so far  into the communion of the elect; and has had his share in the everlasting  All Saints' Day which is in heaven.  He has been, though but for a  moment, in harmony with the polity of the Living God, the heavenly  Jerusalem; and with an innumerable company of angels, and the church of  the first-born who are written in heaven; and with the spirits of just  men made perfect, and with all past, present, and to come, in this and in  all other worlds, of whom it is written, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit:   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed are they who hunger and  thirst after righteousness:  for they shall be filled.  Blessed are the  pure in heart:  for they shall see God.  Blessed are they who are  persecuted for righteousness' sake:  for their's is the kingdom of  heaven.\"  Great indeed is their reward, for it is no less than the very  beatific vision to contemplate and adore.  That supreme moral beauty, of  which all earthly beauty, all nature, all art, all poetry, all music, are  but phantoms and parables, hints and hopes, dim reflected rays of the  clear light of that everlasting day, of which it is written--that \"the  city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:  for  the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.\"    SERMON II.  PREPARATION FOR ADVENT    Westminster Abbey.  November 15, 1874.  Amos iv. 12.  \"Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.\"  We read to-day, for the first lesson, parts of the prophecy of Amos.   They are somewhat difficult, here and there, to understand; but  nevertheless Amos is perhaps the grandest of the Hebrew prophets, next to  Isaiah.  Rough and homely as his words are, there is a strength, a  majesty, and a terrible earnestness in them, which it is good to listen  to; and specially good now that Advent draws near, and we have to think  of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and what His coming means.   \"Prepare to meet thy God,\" says Amos in the text.  Perhaps he will tell  us how to meet our God.  Amos is specially the poor man's prophet, for he was a poor man himself;  not a courtier like Isaiah, or a priest like Jeremiah, or a sage like  Daniel; but a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit in Tekoa, near  Bethlehem, where Amos was born.  Yet to this poor man, looking after  sheep and cattle on the downs, and pondering on the wrongs and misery  around, the word of the Lord came, and he knew that God had spoken to  him, and that he must go and speak to men, at the risk of his life, what  God had bidden, against all the nations round and their kings, and  against the king and nobles and priests of Israel, and the king and  nobles and priests of Judah, and tell them that the day of the Lord is at  hand, and that they must prepare to meet their God.  And he said what he  felt he must say with a noble freedom, with a true independence such as  the grace of God alone can give.  Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, who was  worshipping (absurd as it may seem to us) God and the golden calf at the  same time in King Jeroboam's court, complained loudly, it would seem, of  Amos's plain speaking.  How uncourteous to prophesy that Jeroboam should  die by the sword, and Israel be carried captive out of their own land!   Let him go home into his own land of Judah, and prophesy there; but not  prophesy at Bethel, for it was the king's chapel and the king's court.   Amos went, I presume, in fear of his life.  But he left noble words  behind him.  \"I was no prophet,\" he said to Amaziah, \"nor a prophet's  son, but a herdsman, and a gatherer of wild figs.  And the Lord took me  as I followed the flock, and said, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.\"   And then he turned on that smooth court-priest Amaziah, and pronounced  against him, in the name of the Lord, a curse too terrible to be repeated  here.  Now what was the secret of this inspired herdsman's strength?  What  helped him to face priests, nobles, and kings?  What did he believe?   What did he preach?  He believed and preached the kingdom of God and His  righteousness; the simple but infinite difference between right and  wrong; and the certain doom of wrong, if wrong was persisted in.  He  believed in the kingdom of God.  He told the kings and the people of all  the nations round, that they had committed cruel and outrageous sins, not  against the Jews merely, but against each other.  In the case of Moab,  the culminating crime was an insult to the dead.  He had burned the bones  of the king of Edom into lime.  In the case of Ammon, it was brutal  cruelty to captive women; but in the cases of Gaza, of Tyre, and of Edom,  it was slave-making and slave-trading invasions of Palestine.  \"Thus  saith the Lord:  For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will  not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive  the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom.  But I will send a fire  upon the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof.\"  Yes.  Slave-hunting and slave-trading wars--that was and is an iniquity  which the just and merciful Ruler of the earth would not, and will not,  pardon.  And honour to those who, as in Africa of late, put down those  foul deeds, wheresoever they are done; who, at the risk of their own  lives, dare free the captives from their chains; and who, if interfered  with in their pious work, dare execute on armed murderers and manstealers  the vengeance of a righteous God.  For the Lord God was their King, and  their Judge, whether they knew it or not.  And for three transgressions  of theirs, and for four, the Lord would not turn away their punishment,  but would send fire and sword among them, and they should be carried away  captive, as they had carried others away.  But to go back.  Amos next  turns to his own countrymen--to Judah and Israel, who were then two  separate nations.  For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, the  Lord would not turn away their punishment, because they had despised the  law of the Lord, and had not walked in His commandments.  Therefore He  would send a fire on Judah, and it should devour the palaces of  Jerusalem.  But Amos is most bitter against Israel, against the court of  King Jeroboam at Samaria, and against the rich men of Israel, the bulls  of Bashan, as he calls them.  For three transgressions, and for four, the  Lord would not turn away their punishment.  And why?  Now see what I meant when I said that Amos believed not only in the  kingdom of God, but in the righteousness of God.  It was not merely that  they were worshipping idols--golden calves at Dan, and Bethel, and  Samaria, at the same time that they worshipped the true God.  That was  bad, but there was more behind.  These men were bad, proud, luxurious,  cruel; they were selling their countrymen for slaves--selling, he says so  twice, as if it was some notorious and special case, an honest man for  silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes.  They were lying down on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10116"],["title","All Saints' Day and Other Sermons (#2)"],["body","taken on pledge by every altar.  They were breaking the seventh  commandment in an abominable way.  They were falsifying weights and  measures, and selling the refuse of the wheat.  They stored up the fruits  of violence and robbery in their palaces.  They hated him who rebuked  them, and abhorred him that spoke uprightly.  They trod upon the poor and  crushed the needy, and then said to their stewards, \"Bring wine, and let  us drink.\"  Therefore though they had built houses of hewn stone, they  should not live in them.  They had planted pleasant vineyards, but should  not drink of them.  And all the while these superstitious and wicked rich  men were talking of the day of the Lord, and hoping that the day of the  Lord would appear.  You, if you have read your Bibles carefully and reverently, must surely  be aware that the day of the Lord, either in the Old Testament or in the  New, does not mean merely the final day of judgment, but any striking  event, any great crisis in the world's history, which throws a divine  light upon that history, and shows to men--at least to those who have  eyes wherewith to see--that verily there is a God who judges the earth in  righteousness, and ministers true judgment among the people;--a God whom  men, and all their institutions, should always be prepared to meet, lest  coming suddenly, He find them sleeping.  If you are not aware of this,  the real meaning of a day of the Lord, a day of the Son of Man, let me  entreat you to go and search the Scriptures for yourselves; for in them  ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of the  Lord, of that Eternal Son of whom the second Psalm speaks, in words which  mobs and tyrants, the atheist and the superstitious, are alike willing to  forget.  In the time of Amos, the rich tyrants of Israel seem to have meant by the  day of the Lord some vague hope that, in those dark and threatening  times, God would interfere to save them, if they were attacked by foreign  armies.  But woe to you that desire the day of the Lord, says Amos the  herdsman.  What do you want with it?  You will find it very different  from what you expect.  There is a day of the Lord coming, he says,  therefore prepare to meet your God.  But you are unprepared, and you will  find the day of the Lord very different from what you expect.  It will be  a day in which you will learn the righteousness of God.  Because He is  righteous He will not suffer your unrighteousness.  Because He is good,  He will not permit you to be bad.  The day of the Lord to you will be  darkness and not light, not as you dream deliverance from the invaders,  but ruin by the invaders, from which will be no escape.  \"As if a man did  flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned  his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.\"  There will be no escape  for those wicked men.  Though they dug into hell, God's hand would take  them; though they climbed up into heaven, God would fetch them down;  though they hid in the bottom of the sea, God would command the serpent,  and it should bite them.  He would sift the house of Israel among all  nations like corn in a sieve, and not a grain should fall to the earth.   And all the sinners among God's people should die by the sword, who say,  \"The evil shall not overtake us.\"  This was Amos's notion of the kingdom of God and His righteousness.   These Israelites would not obey the laws of God's kingdom, and be  righteous and good.  But Amos told them, they could not get rid of God's  kingdom.  The Lord was King, in spite of them, and they would find it out  to their sorrow.  If they would not seek His kingdom and His government,  His government would seek them and find them, and find their evil-doings  out.  If they would not seek God's righteousness, His righteousness would  seek them, and execute righteous judgment on them.  No wonder that the  Israelites thought Amos a most troublesome and insolent person.  No  wonder that the smooth priest Amaziah begged him to begone and talk in  that way somewhere else.  He saw plainly enough that either Amos must  leave Samaria, or he must leave it.  The two could no more work together  than fire and water.  Amos wanted to make men repent of their sins, while  Amaziah wanted only to make them easy in their minds; and no man can do  both at once.  So it was then, my friends, and so it will be till the end of this wicked  world.  The way to please men, and be popular, always was, and always  will be, Amaziah's way; to tell men that they may worship God and the  golden calf at the same time, that they may worship God and money,  worship God and follow the ways of this wicked world which suit their  fancy and their interest; to tell them the kingdom of God is not over you  now, Christ is not ruling the world now; that the kingdom of God will  only come, when Christ comes at the last day, and meanwhile, if people  will only believe what they are told, and live tolerably respectable  lives, they may behave in all things else as if there was no God, and no  judgments of God.  Seeking the righteousness of God, say these preachers  of Amaziah's school, only means, that if Christ's righteousness is  imputed to you need not be righteous yourselves, but will go to heaven  without having been good men here on earth.  That is the comfortable  message which the world delights to hear, and for which the world will  pay a high price to its flatterers.  But if any man dares to tell his fellow-men what Amos told them, and say,  The kingdom of God is among you, and within you, and over you, whether  you like or not, and you are in it; the Lord is King, be the people never  so unquiet; and all power is given to Him in heaven and earth already;  and at the last great day, when He comes in glory, He will show that He  has been governing the world and the inhabitants thereof all along,  whether they cared to obey Him or not:--if he tell men, that the  righteousness of God means this--to pray for the Spirit of God and of  Christ, that they may be perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect,  and holy as Christ is holy, for without holiness no man shall see the  Lord:  if he tell men, that the wrath of God was revealed from heaven at  the fall of man, and has been revealed continuously ever since, against  all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, that indignation and wrath,  tribulation and anguish will fall upon every soul of man that doeth evil;  and glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good:--when a man  dares to preach that, he is no more likely to be popular with the wicked  world (for it is a wicked world) than Amos was popular, or St Paul was  popular, or our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave both to Amos and to St Paul  their messages, was popular.  False preachers will dislike that man,  because he wishes to make sinners uneasy, while they wish to make them  easy.  Philosophers, falsely so-called, will dislike that man, because he  talks of the kingdom of God, the providence of God, and they are busy--at  least, just now--in telling men that there is no providence and no God-- at least, no living God.  The covetous and worldly will dislike that man,  for they believe that the world is governed, not by God, but by money.   Politicians will dislike that man, because they think that not God, but  they, govern the world, by those very politics and knavish tricks, which  we pray God to confound, whenever we sing \"God save the Queen.\"  And the  common people--the masses--who ought to hear such a man gladly, for his  words are to them, if they would understand them, a gospel, and good news  of divine hope and deliverance from sin and ignorance, oppression and  misery--the masses, I say, will dislike that man, because he tells them  that God's will is law, and must be obeyed at all risks:  and the poor  fools have got into their heads just now that not God's will, but the  will of the people, is law, and that not the eternal likeness of God, but  whatever they happen to decide by the majority of the moment, is right.  And so such a preacher will not be popular with the many.  They will  dismiss him, at best, as they might a public singer or lecturer, with  compliments and thanks, and so excuse themselves from doing what he tells  them.  And he must look for his sincere hearers in the hearts of those-- and there are such, I verily believe, in this congregation--who have a  true love and a true fear of Christ, their incarnate God--who believe,  indeed, that Christ is their King, and the King of all the earth; who  think that to please Him is the most blessed, as well as the most  profitable, thing which man can do; to displease Him the most horrible,  as well as the most dangerous, thing which man can do; and who,  therefore, try to please Him by becoming like Him, by really renouncing  the world and all its mean and false and selfish ways, and putting on His  new pattern of man, which is created after God's likeness in  righteousness and true holiness.  Blessed are they, for of them it is  written, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after  righteousness, for they shall be filled.\"  Even Christ Himself shall fill  them.  Blessed are they, and all that they take in hand, for of them it  is written, \"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord, and walk in His  ways.  For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands.\"  \"The Lord is  righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works.  The Lord is nigh  unto all them that call upon Him, yea, all such as call upon Him  faithfully.  He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him.  He also  will hear their cry\"--ay, \"and will help them.\"  Happy, ay, blest will such souls be, let the day of the Lord appear when  it will, or how it will.  It may appear--the day of the Lord, as it has  appeared again and again in history--in the thunder of some mighty war.   It may appear after some irresistible, though often silent revolution,  whether "]]]
