Captain Raleigh, in the meantime, had approached Jack and his seconds.  \"It is only fair to warn you,\" he said quietly, \"that the man whom you are to oppose is Tim Harris, champion of the British fleet.\"  Jack was surprised.  \"I didn't know that, sir. I thought he was with the _Queen Elizabeth_.\"  \"Well, he's here; but I didn't know it until a moment ago. It will be no dishonor to you if you wish to withdraw. A man must be in perfect trim to stand before Harris.\"  \"Why,\" said Jack, in surprise, \"I can hardly do that now, sir. The men are depending on me.\"  Captain Raleigh smiled frankly.  \"You are all right, boy,\" he said. \"At your first words I thought you were afraid. But you cannot hope for victory.\"  \"I always hope for victory, sir, and I shall do my best. I am no novice.\"  \"Perhaps not; but Harris is almost a professional; in fact, I may say, a good deal better than many professionals. He is fast for a man of his size and has a terrible right-hand punch. I have seen him box often. If you are decided to go on with this, a word of warning. Watch that right hand of his like you would a hawk.\"  \"I shall remember, sir,\" replied Jack. \"Thank you.\"  \"All right then,\" said Captain Raleigh. \"I like your spunk. Good luck to you.\"  Captain Raleigh walked back to Captain Reynold's side.  \"Will he withdraw?\" asked the latter.  \"He will not. He says the men are depending on him and he must go through with it.\"  \"By Jove! a fine spirit!\" exclaimed Captain Reynolds. \"I hope he is not too easily disposed of.\"  \"I don't think he will be,\" said Captain Raleigh, quietly. \"Someway, I have a feeling that you haven't carried off the honors yet.\"  \"But it's foolish to talk like that, Raleigh,\" said Captain Reynolds. \"You know this man, Harris.\"  \"I suppose it is foolish, but it's the way I feel just the same. Ah! There's Harris now.\"  Tim Harris had appeared on deck; and the crew of the _Indefatigable_ went wild. Now for the first time the crew of the _Queen Mary_ knew who Jack's opponent would be; and after a look at Harris, they became strangely silent. Then one voice called:  \"Never mind who he is. Templeton can lick him, anyhow!\"  The others took up the cry and Jack smiled.  Now the referee called the principals to him and gave them their instructions.  \"No hitting in clinches, and clean breaks,\" he said.  Jack and Harris nodded that they understood. As the two stood there together, the crowd sized them up.  Jack, standing well above six feet, still was not as tall as his opponent, who topped him by a full inch. Their arms were about of a length, but Harris was big through the chest and his arms seemed more powerful than Jack's. A close observer, however, would have seen that while Jack was in perfect physical condition, Harris carried a trifle too much fat--not much, but still a trifle. With the battle anywhere near equal, this fat might prove to Jack's advantage.  Jack's arms showed strength, but the muscles were not knotted like those of Harris. Harris was perhaps twenty-eight years old, Jack almost ten years younger. Jack had the youth, but Harris had the experience of many hard encounters. It appeared that the odds were heavily against Jack.  Jack and Harris sized each other carefully. Jack smiled. So did Harris. As they touched gloves, Harris said:  \"You're a nice boy. I don't want to hurt you too much, so I'll make this short\"--the referee had announced that the match was to be for ten rounds.  \"Don't worry about me,\" said Jack. \"I can take care of myself. If the match is short you won't find me on the deck.\"  Harris would have replied, but at that moment the referee called:  \"Time!\"  Jack leaped lightly backward even as Harris aimed a vicious blow at his head, apparently trying to make good his word to end the battle at once. The blow missed Jack's face by the fraction of an inch. Harris followed up this blow with a right and left, which Jack blocked neatly, and then brought his right up, trying to upper cut.  Jack leaped backward and the blow grazed his chin. Before Harris could recover, Jack stepped quickly forward and planted a sharp right and a hard left to Harris' nose. Harris stepped back and wiped away a stream of red.  It was first blood for Jack and the crew of the _Queen Mary_ sent up a wild cheer.  But Harris only smiled. He was not to be caught so easily again.  These two blows had given the _Indefatigable_ champion some respect for Jack's ability. He advanced more carefully this time. He feinted rapidly and shot his left forward, quickly followed by his right. But Jack had not been deceived and caught both blows upon his forearms.  \"You're all right, boy,\" said Harris, admiringly, \"It's a pleasure to box with you.\"  \"And I may say the same,\" said Jack.  They fell to it again.  As Harris stepped quickly forward his foot slipped and he fell to one knee.  \"Hit him when he gets up!\" came a cry from the crowd.  Instead, Jack lowered his guard and extended a hand. He helped his opponent to his feet. Then he stepped back and the battle continued.  Now Jack decided that he would feel the other out. He feinted rapidly, once, twice, and struck out with a right; and he staggered back suddenly, for something had suddenly come up under his chin with terrible force. In a moment Jack realized what _it_ was. It was Harris' right, which Captain Raleigh had warned him against. Had the blow been timed perfectly, Jack realized, the fight would have been over then and there.  Guarding desperately, Jack managed to fall into a clinch, where he hung on until his head cleared. As he stepped back the referee called time. The first round was Harris' by the margin of that hard uppercut.  \"I'll be a little more careful of that right,\" Jack confided to his seconds, as he again advanced into the ring.  Again the lad assumed the offensive, keeping careful eye on his opponent's right fist. Again Harris tried to reach Jack's chin, but this time Jack blocked the blow. He knew he would not be caught that way again. Jack feinted three times, twice with his left and once with his right, and then the right crashed against Harris' ear. The man staggered back and before he could recover Jack planted two hard blows --right and left--to his sore nose. Desperately, Harris rushed into a clinch.  Again the crew of the _Queen Mary_ cheered.  \"And what do you think of that, eh?\" asked Captain Raleigh of Captain Reynolds.  \"The boy is a fighter,\" was the latter's reply. \"But wait; experience will tell.\"  Harris became more cautious. He circled around Jack, lightly, dancing about on his toes. The lad followed him quietly. Suddenly, Harris' left fist shot out. Jack blocked, but before he could recover, Harris launched himself like a catapult and a series of right and lefts descended on Jack's face, neck, ears and abdomen.  Jack staggered back and Harris followed him closely, giving him no rest Jack was still retreating at the bell.  Again in the third and in the fourth round Jack seemed to be getting the worst of it. In the fifth he braced and sent in as good as he received. In the sixth he almost floored Harris with a straight right to the side of the jaw; and in the seventh Harris was kept on the defensive.  But in the eighth Jack again encountered Harris' right and the force of the blow sent him reeling. All through the round Harris followed up this advantage, and at the bell, it seemed that Jack would be unable to continue the fight.  But his head cleared in the one minute rest period; and he fought through the ninth round carefully. The lad realized now that, so far, Harris had the better of the encounter and that, if he hoped to win, it must be by a knockout. So, while Harris was trying in vain to put in a finishing punch, Jack husbanded his strength, determined to make a strong effort in the final round.  The rest refreshed him still more; and as time was called for the tenth, Jack cast discretion to the winds and leaped forward.  In spite of this, he was cool, however, and kept his eye peeled for the movement that would tell him Harris was about to launch his right.  A right and left he landed to Harris' sore nose. Then Harris rushed. Jack was forced back around the ring by the force of this rush and backed against the ropes; but he bounded out with great force and landed a vicious left to the side of Harris' jaw. Then they clinched.  As the referee parted them, Jack saw the movement for which he had been watching. Harris again was about to launch that terrible right. The lad waited calmly.  \"Swish!\"  It flashed forth faster than the eye could see. But it had not come too quick for Jack, who was expecting it.  The blow was aimed for the point of the chin and would have ended the fight right there. But, judging the distance exactly, Jack moved his head a trifle to one side; and Harris' fist flashed by his chin by the fraction of an inch.  With all his force behind the blow, Jack put a straight left to Harris' jaw. A terrible jolt to the abdomen followed; and, as Harris head came forward again, Jack pivoted on his heel and struck with his right.  He had judged the time and the distance perfectly. His right fist caught Harris squarely upon the point of the chin. There was a \"smack\" that could be heard even above the cheering of the _Queen Mary's_ crew, followed by a crash as Harris fell to the deck. With half a minute of the last round to go, Jack had knocked the man out and won the day for the _Queen Mary_ by a score of twelve to nine.  And the crew cheered again!    CHAPTER VI  SCOUTING   Harris remained prostrate on the deck.  Quickly, Jack pulled off his gloves and, leaning down, he picked up the unconscious man and carried him to his own cabin. There he bathed the man's face and brought him back to consciousness.  \"How do you feel, old man?\" he asked.  Harris looked at the lad queerly.  \"So you beat me, eh?\" he said. \"Well, to tell you the truth, after the fifth round I expected it. I am no match for you and I know it. Do you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10081"],["title","The Boy Allies at Jutland; Or, The Greatest Naval Battle of History (#5)"],["body"," that you are the champion of the British fleet now?\"  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" was Jack's reply.  \"You have defeated the champion, so your title is undisputed,\" said Harris.  He rose from the bunk where Jack had placed him and felt tenderly of his chin.  \"Quite a wallop,\" he said calmly. \"Well, let me congratulate you. I am glad that, as long as I had to be defeated some day, it was you who turned the trick.\"  He extended a hand and Jack grasped it heartily.  \"You would probably down me next time,\" he said.  \"Not a chance,\" replied Harris. \"I know when I have met my superior.\"  He moved toward the door. There he paused for a moment and said:  \"Well, I must go and dress now. I hope that I may see you again before long.\"  \"I am sure I hope so, too,\" returned Jack.  Hardly had Harris taken his departure when running feet approached Jack's cabin. A moment later a crowd of sailors burst into the room. Before Jack realized what was going on, they had seized him, hoisted him to their shoulders and rushed out on deck again. There, for perhaps half an hour, they paraded up and down, cheering wildly.  They lowered him to the deck, however, when Captain Raleigh and Captain Reynolds approached. The former spoke first.  \"I must congratulate you upon your remarkable exhibition,\" he said. \"You are a brave boy.\"  Jack flushed and hung his head.  \"When I am mistaken I admit it,\" said Captain Reynolds. \"You are more than a match for Harris at any time.\"  \"I did the best I could,\" said Jack, sheepishly.  \"Well, it was pretty good,\" said Captain Reynolds.  With Captain Raleigh he moved away.  Frank now approached and accompanied Jack back to their cabin, where Jack got info his uniform.  \"Some scrapper, you are,\" said Frank. \"I thought you were done for once or twice, though.\"  \"I thought so myself,\" returned Jack, with a grin. \"I was pretty lucky in that last round, if you ask me.\"  \"Harris was pretty unlucky, I know that,\" said Frank, grimly. \"Hurry up, it's time to eat.\"  Jack's fight was the talk of the day aboard the _Queen Mary_; and aboard the _Indefatigable_, too, for that matter. In fact, all the British fleet within wireless radius knew before night that there was a new champion of the British fleet; and they cheered him, though he could not hear.  It was upon the following morning, while the _Queen Mary_ steamed about in the North Sea, that Jack and Frank embarked upon their first piece of work since they had been assigned to the giant battleship.  Both lads were in their cabin studying, when an orderly announced that Captain Raleigh desired their presence. They obeyed the summons at once.  \"And how do you feel today?\" asked Captain Raleigh, as he eyed Jack, quietly.  \"First rate, sir.\"  \"Feel like another fight?\"  \"No, sir. I don't make a practice of that sort of thing.\"  \"I'm glad to hear that. How would you like to take a little trip?\"  \"First rate, sir. Where to, sir?\"  \"Well, that's rather a difficult question,\" returned Captain Raleigh. \"Here, read this,\" and he passed the lad a slip of paper.  Jack did as commanded. This is what he read:  \"Large number of enemy aircraft reported flying over North Sea, fifty miles south of you, every night. Investigate.  (Signed) \"BEATTY.\"  Jack passed the slip of paper back.  \"Well?\" exclaimed Captain Raleigh.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack. \"You want me to find out what's going on, sir?\"  \"Exactly. Can you run a hydroplane?\"  \"No, sir; but Frank here can.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Lieutenant Chadwick, sir.\"  \"Oh,\" said the commander, \"so he is Frank, eh? All right. Then here is what I want you two to do. Take the hydroplane aft and fly south. Take your time and see what you can find out. The matter may amount to nothing, and then again it may forebode something serious.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" replied Frank. \"When shall we start, sir?\"  \"You may as well start immediately. It is hardly possible, judging by the tone of that message, that you will find anything by daylight, but at least you can be on the ground by night.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said Jack, and waited to see if there were any further instructions.  Captain Raleigh dismissed the two lads with a wave of his hand.  \"That is all,\" he said. \"Report the moment you are able to do so.\"  The two lads saluted and returned to their own cabin.  \"You see,\" said Frank, \"we didn't have to wait very long to find something to do.\"  \"I see we didn't,\" agreed Frank. \"Now, the first thing to do is shed these uniforms.\"  \"What for?\"  \"So that we shall not be taken for British should we fall among the enemy. We'll put on plain khaki suits.\"  \"Well, whatever you say,\" said Frank.  This was the work of but a few moments; and half an hour later the two lads soared into the air in one of the _Queen Mary's_ large hydroplanes.  \"This is something like it, if you ask me,\" said Frank, as he bent over the wheel.  \"Pretty fine,\" Jack agreed, raising his voice to make himself heard above the whir of the propellers and the noise of the engine. \"I wouldn't mind flying all the time.\"  \"Where do we want to come down, Jack?\" asked Frank.  \"Let's see. The message said the enemy was flying about fifty miles south. They probably won't be out before dark, so I should say it might be well to go a little beyond that point.\"  \"All right. But we may miss them in the darkness tonight.\"  \"By Jove! That's so! Funny I didn't think of that. Let me think a moment.\"  \"No use of thinking,\" said Frank, \"I have a scheme that will work all right.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Why, we'll stop right in the path taken by the enemy planes and then drop down upon the water.\"  \"So the Germans can see us as they fly by, eh?\"  \"They won't see us in the dark,\" said Frank. \"We'll be a pretty small spot down on the water. They will be looking for nothing so small.\"  \"I guess you are right, after all,\" Jack agreed. \"At least it's worth trying. We'll be sure to hear them flying above; and if we went beyond the lane of travel, or didn't go far enough, we might not even see them.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Frank. \"Well, there is no hurry, so I may as well slow down a bit.\"  He did so and they went along more leisurely.  \"Can't see what the Germans would be flying about here for,\" said Jack, \"and I have been trying to figure it out ever since I read that message.\"  \"So have I,\" declared Frank, \"If they were Zeppelins I could understand it; they would be going and returning from raids on the British coast; but surely they would not venture that distance with aeroplanes.\"  \"I wouldn't think so. Still, you never can tell about those fellows. They do a lot of strange things.\"  \"So they do. Say!\" Frank was struck with a sudden thought. \"You don't suppose the presence of many of those fellows heralds the advance of the German fleet, do you? They might be just reconnoitering, you know.\"  \"No, I hardly think that could be it. The Germans are afraid to venture out. They know they'll get licked if they do.\"  \"Well, those aeroplanes come out every night for some purpose, that's sure,\" said Frank. \"It's a wonder to me the Germans haven't tried to sneak out in great force before now. They could come along here without any trouble, or they could make the effort farther north, say near Jutland.\"  \"Well, I suppose they'll try it some day,\" said Jack, \"but not right away. How much farther do we have to go?\"  Frank glanced at his chart and then at his speedometer.  \"About fifteen miles,\" was his reply; \"and then we'll be there too soon.\"  The lad was right. It was not three o'clock when the hydroplane came to the spot the lads had selected to descend.  \"Well, here we are,\" said Frank.  \"Guess we may as well go down, then,\" said Jack. \"Some of those fellows are likely to be prowling about and spot us.\"  \"Just as you say,\" agreed Frank.  He set the planes and the machine glided to the water, where it came to rest lightly.  \"Glad there is no sun,\" said Jack, \"it would be awfully hot down here.\"  And there the lads spent the afternoon. Darkness came at last, and with its coming, the lads made ready for whatever might occur. Eight o'clock came and there had been no sounds of airships flying above. The lads strained their ears, listening for the slightest sound.  And, shortly after nine o'clock, their efforts were rewarded. Jack suddenly took Frank by the arm.  \"Listen!\" he exclaimed in a low voice.    CHAPTER VII  AMONG THE ENEMY   To Frank's ears came a distant whirring. To ears less keen than the lad's the sound, which came from above, might have been some bird of the night flapping its wings as it soared overhead. But to Frank and Jack both it meant something entirely different. It was the sound for which they had been waiting. It was an airship.  Through his night glass Jack scanned the clouds and at last he picked up the object for which he sought. Almost directly overhead at that moment, but flying rapidly westward, was a single aeroplane. So high in the air was the machine that it looked a mere speck and Jack was unable to determine from that distance whether it was British or German.  \"See it, Jack?\" asked Frank in a low voice.  \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"A single craft, perhaps half a mile up.\"  \"No more in sight, eh?\"  \"Not yet. This one is heading west.\"  \"Guess we had better get up that way, then,\" said Frank.  Jack assented.  A moment later the hydroplane was skimming swiftly over the water. For perhaps three hundred yards Frank kept the craft on the water; then sent it soaring into the air above.  There was not a word between the two boys until the hydroplane was a quarter of a mile in the air. Then Jack said:  \"Make your elevation half a mile and then head west, slowly. The chances are there will be more of them. In the darkness we can let them overtake us and mingle with them in safety.\"  Frank gave his endorsement to this plan and the machine continued to rise. At the proper elevation, Frank turned the hydroplane's head westward and reduced the speed to less than thirty miles an hour. So slow was its gait, in fact, that it had the"]]]
