It was just before the call to supper formation when England's coast loomed up. Most of the midshipmen stood at the rail, watching eagerly for a better glimpse at the coast.  Some of the midshipmen, especially those who came from wealthier families, had been in England before entering the Naval Academy. These fortunate ones were questioned eagerly by their comrades.  The battleships were well in sight of Eastern King Point when the midshipmen's call for supper formation sounded. Feeling that they would much have preferred to wait for their supper, the young men hastened below.  After the line was formed it seemed to the impatient young men as though it had never taken so long to read the orders.  Yet there came one welcome order, to the effect that, immediately after the morning meal, all midshipmen might go to the pay officer and draw ten dollars, to be charged against their pay accounts.  \"That ten dollars apiece looms up large David, little giant,\" murmured Dan Dalzell, while the evening meal was in progress.  \"We ought to have a lot of fun on it,\" replied Darrin, who was looking forward with greatest eagerness to his first visit to any foreign soil. \"But how much shore leave are we to have?\"  \"Two days, the word is. We'll get it straight in the morning, at breakfast formation.\"  In defiance of regulations, Midshipman Pennington, whose father was wealthy, had several hundred dollars concealed in his baggage. He had already invited Hallam, Mossworth and Dickey to keep in his wake on shore, and these young men had gladly enough agreed.  \"Say, but we're slackening speed!\" quivered Dalzell, when the meal was nearly finished.  \"Headway has stopped,\" declared Darrin a few moments later.  \"Listen, everyone!\" called Farley. \"Don't you hear the rattle of the anchor chains?\"  \"Gentlemen, as we're forbidden to make too much racket,\" proposed irrepressible Dan, \"let us give three silent cheers for Old England!\"  Rising in his place, Dan raised his hand aloft, and brought it down, as his lips silently formed a \"hurrah!\"  Three times this was done, each time the lips of the midshipmen forming a silent cheer.  Then Dan, with a mighty swoop of his right arm, let his lips form the word that everyone knew to be \"tiger!\"  \"Ugh-h-h!\" groaned Midshipman Reilly.  \"Throw that irresponsible Fenian out!\" directed Dan, grinning.  Then the midshipmen turned their attention to the remnants of the meal.  Boom! sounded sharply overhead.  \"There goes the twenty-one-gunner,\" announced Darrin.  When a foreign battleship enters a fortified port the visiting fleet, or rather, its flagship, fires a national salute of twenty-one guns. After a short interval following the discharge of the last gun, one of the forts on shore answers with twenty-one guns. This is one of the methods of observing the courtesies between nations by their respective fleets.  Ere all the guns had been fired from the flagship, the third classmen received the rising signal; the class marched out and was dismissed. Instantly a break was made for deck.  The midshipmen were in good time to see the smoke and hear the roar of guns from one of the forts on shore.  In the morning the commandant of cadets, as commanding officer of the squadron, would go ashore with his aide and pay a formal call to the senior military officer. Later in the day that English officer and one or two of his staff officers would return the call by coming out to the flagship. That accomplished, all the required courtesies would have been observed.  It was still broad daylight, for in summer the English twilight is a long one, and darkness does not settle down until late.  \"Oh, if we were only going ashore to-night!\" murmured Hallam. There were many others to echo the thought, but all knew that it could not be done.  \"Couldn't we find a trick for slipping ashore after lights out?\" eagerly queried Dickey, who was not noted as a \"greaser.\"  \"Could we?\" quivered Hallam, who, with few demerits against him, felt inclined to take a chance.  But Pennington, to whom he appealed, shook his head.  \"Too big a risk, Hally,\" replied Pen. \"And trebly dangerous, with that greaser, Darrin, in the class.\"  \"Oh, stow that,\" growled Hallam. \"Darrin is no greaser. You've got him on your black books--that's all.\"  \"He is a greaser, I tell you,\" cried Pennington fiercely.  There were a score of midshipmen in this group, and many of them nodded approvingly at Pennington's statement. Though still a class leader, Dave had lost some of his popularity since his report to the police of Annapolis.  So the middies turned in, that night, with unsatisfied dreams of shore life in England.  Soon after breakfast the next morning, however, every midshipman had drawn his ten dollars, even to Pennington, who had no use for such a trifling amount.  As fast as possible the launches ranged alongside at the side gangway, taking off groups of midshipmen, everyone of whom had been cautioned to be at dock in time to board a launch in season for supper formation.  Pennington and his party were among the first to land. They hurried away.  It was on the second trip of one of the launches that Dave, Dan and Farley made their get away. These three chums had agreed to stick together during the day. They landed at the Great Western Docks, to find themselves surrounded by eager British cabbies.  \"Are we going to take a cab and get more quickly and intelligently to the best part of the town to see?\" asked Farley.  \"I don't vote for it,\" replied Darrin. \"We have only five dollars apiece for each of the two days we're to be ashore. I move that we put in the forenoon, anyway, in prowling about the town for ourselves. We'll learn more than we would by riding.\"  \"Come on, then,\" approved Dan.  Plymouth is an old-fashioned English seaport that has been rather famous ever since the thirteenth century. Many parts of the town, including whole streets, look as though the houses had been built since that time. This is especially true of many of the streets near the water front.  For two hours the three middies roamed through the streets, often meeting fellow classmen. Wherever the young midshipmen went many of the English workmen and shopkeepers raised their hats in friendly salute of the American uniform.  \"We don't seem to run across Pen's gang anywhere,\" remarked Farley at last.  \"Oh, no,\" smiled Dave. \"That's a capitalistic crowd. They'll hit only the high spots.\"  Nevertheless, these three poor-in-purse midshipmen enjoyed themselves hugely in seeing the quaint old town. At noon they found a real old English chop house, where they enjoyed a famous meal.  \"I wish we could slip some of these little mutton pies back with us!\" sighed Dan wistfully.  In the afternoon the three chums saw the newer market place, where all three bought small souvenirs for their mothers at home. Darrin also secured a little remembrance present for his sweetheart, Belle Meade.  The guild hall and some of the other famous buildings were visited.  Later in the afternoon Dave began to inspect his watch every two or three minutes.  \"No need for us to worry, with Dave's eye glued to his watch,\" laughed Dan.  \"Come on, fellows,\" summoned Darrin finally. \"We haven't more than time now to make the dock and get back to supper formation.\"  \"Take a cab?\" asked Farley. \"You know, we've found that they're vastly cheaper than American cabs.\"  \"No-o-o, not for me,\" decided Dave. \"We'll need the rest of our shore money to-morrow, and our legs are good and sturdy.\"  Yet even careful Dave, as it turned out, had allowed no more than time. The chums reached the dock in time to see the launches half way between the fleet and shore. Some forty other midshipmen stood waiting on the dock.  Among these were Pennington and his party, all looking highly satisfied with their day's sport, as indeed they were.  Pennington's eyes gleamed when he caught sight of Darrin, Dalzell and Farley--for Pen had a scheme of his own in mind.  Not far from Pennington stood a little Englishman with keen eyes and a jovial face. Pen stepped over to him.  \"There are the three midshipmen I was telling you about,\" whispered Pennington, slipping a half sovereign into the Englishman's hand. \"You thoroughly understand your part in the joke, don't you?\"  \"Don't h'I, though--just, sir!\" laughed the undersized Englishman, and strolled away.  Darrin and his friends were soon informed by classmates that the launches now making shore-ward were coming in on their last trip for midshipmen.  \"Well, we're here in plenty of time,\" sighed Dave contentedly.  \"Oh, I knew we'd be, with you holding the watch,\" laughed Dan in his satisfied way.  As the three stood apart they were joined by the undersized Englishman, who touched his hat to them with a show of great respect.  \"Young gentlemen,\" he inquired, \"h'I suppose, h'of course, you've 'ad a look h'at the anchor h'of Sir Francis Drake's flagship, the time 'e went h'out h'and sank the great Spanish h'Armada?\"  \"Why, no, my friend,\" replied Dave, looking at the man with interest. \"Is that here at Plymouth?\"  \"H'assuredly, sir. H'and h'only a minute's walk h'over to that shed yonder, sir. H'if you'll come with me, young gentlemen, h'I'll show h'it to you. H'it's one of h'our biggest sights, h'and it's in me own custody, at present. Come this way, young gentlemen.\"  \"That sounds like something worth seeing,\" declared Dave to his comrades. \"Come along. It'll take the launches at least six minutes to get in, and then they'll stay tied up here for another five minutes.\"  With only a single backward glance at the young midshipmen, the undersized Englishman was already leading the way.  At quickened pace the young midshipmen reached the shed that had been indicated. Their guide had already drawn a key from a pocket, and had unsnapped the heavy padlock.  \"Step"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10045"],["title","Dave Darrin's Second Year at Annapolis (#8)"],["body","in, young gentlemen, h'and h'I'll follow h'and show h'it to you.\"  Unsuspecting, the three middies stepped inside the darkened shed. Suddenly the door banged, and a padlock clicked outside.  \"Here, stop that, you rascally joker!\" roared Dalzell, wheeling about. \"What does this mean?\"  \"Big trouble!\" spoke Dave Darrin seriously and with a face from which the color was fast receding.     CHAPTER VII   PENNINGTON GETS HIS WISH  \"The scoundrel!\" gasped Farley, his face whiter than any of the others.  Dave was already at the door, trying to force it open. But he might almost as well have tried to lift one of the twelve-inch guns of the battleship \"Massachusetts.\"  \"We're locked in--that's sure!\" gasped Dalzell, almost dazed by the catastrophe.  \"And what's more, we won't get out in a hurry, unless we can make some of our classmates hear,\" declared Dave.  For the next half minute they yelled themselves nearly hoarse, but no response came.  \"What could have been that little cockney's purpose in playing this shabby trick on us?\" demanded Farley.  \"Perhaps the cockney thinks we're admirals, with our pockets lined with gold. Perhaps he and some of his pals intend to rob us, later in the evening,\" proposed Dan, with a ghastly grin.  \"Any gang would find something of a fight on their hands, then,\" muttered Dave Darrin grimly.  All three were equally at a loss to think of any explanation for such a \"joke\" as this. Equally improbable did it seem that any thugs of the town would expect to reap any harvest from robbing three midshipmen.  Desperately they turned to survey their surroundings. The shed was an old one, yet strongly built. There were no windows, no other door save that at which the three middies now stood baffled.  \"Another good old yell,\" proposed Darrin.  It was given with a lusty will, but proved as fruitless as the former one.  \"We don't take the last launch back to ship,\" declared Farley, wild with rage.  \"Which means a long string of demerits,\" said Dan.  \"No shore leave to-morrow, either,\" groaned Darrin. \"Fellows, this mishap will affect our shore leave throughout all the cruise.\"  \"We can explain it,\" suggested Farley with a hopefulness that he did not feel at all.  \"Of course we can,\" jeered Dave Darrin. \"But what officer is fool enough to believe such a cock-and-bull story as this one will seem? At the very least, the commandant would believe that we had been playing some pretty stiff prank ourselves, in order to get treated in this fashion. No, no, fellows! We may just as well undeceive ourselves, and prepare to take the full soaking of discipline that we're bound to get. If we attempted this sort of explanation, we'd be lucky indeed to get through the affair without being tried by general court-martial for lying.\"  \"Drake's anchor, indeed!\" exclaimed Dan in deep self disgust.  \"We ought to have known better,\" grunted Farley, equally enraged with himself. \"What on earth made us so absent-minded as to believe that a priceless relic would be kept in an old shed like this?\"  \"We're sure enough idiots!\" groaned Dan.  \"Hold on there, fellows,\" interrupted Dave Darrin. \"Vent all your anger right on me. I'm the great and only cause of this misfortune. It was I who proposed that we take up that cockney's invitation. I'm the real and only offender against decent good sense, and yet you both have to suffer with me.\"  \"Let's give another yell, bigger than before,\" suggested Dan weakly.  They did, but with no better result than before.  \"The launches are away now, anyway, I guess,\" groaned Farley, after consulting his watch.  \"Yes, and we're up the tree with the commandant,\" grunted Dalzell bitterly.  \"Yell again?\" asked Farley.  \"No,\" retorted Dave, shaking his head. \"We've seen the uselessness of asking help from outside. Let's supply our own help. Now, then--altogether! Shoulder the door!\"  A savage assault they hurled upon the door. But they merely caused it to vibrate.  \"We can't do it,\" gasped Dan, after the third trial.  Considerable daylight filtered in through the cracks at top, bottom and one side of the door. Further back in the shed there was less light.  \"Let's explore this old place in search of hope,\" begged Dave.  Together they started back, looking about keenly in what appeared to be an empty room.  \"Say! Look at that!\" cried Dave suddenly.  He pointed to a solid looking, not very heavy ship's spar.  \"What good will that thing do us?\" asked Farley rather dubiously.  \"Let's see if we can raise it to our shoulders,\" proposed Dave Darrin radiantly. \"Then well find out!\"  \"Hurrah!\" quivered Dan Dalzell, bending over the spar at the middle.  \"Up with it!\" commanded Darrin, placing himself at the head of the spar. Farley took hold at the further end.  \"Up with it!\" heaved Midshipman Darrin.  Right up the spar went. It would have been a heavy job for three young men of their size in civil life, but midshipmen are constantly undergoing the best sort of physical training.  \"Now, then--a fast run and a hard bump!\" called Darrin.  At the door they rushed, bearing the spar as a battering ram.  Bump! The door shook and shivered.  \"Once more may do it!\" cheered Darrin. \"Back.\"  Again they dashed the head of their battering ram against the door. It gave way, and, climbing through, they raced back to the pier.  But Dan, who had secured the lead, stopped with a groan, pointing out over the water.  \"Not a bit of good, fellows! There go the launches, and we're the only fellows left! It's all up with our summer's fun!\"  \"Is it, though?\" shouted Dave, spurting ahead. \"Come on and find out!\"  As they reached the front of the piers, down at the edge of a landing stage they espied a little steam tender.  \"That boat has to take us out to the 'Massachusetts'!\" cried Darrin desperately, as he plunged down the steps to the landing stage, followed by his two chums.  [Illustration: The Three Midshipmen Raced Toward the Pier.]  \"Who's the captain here?\" called Dave, racing across the landing stage to the tender's gangplank.  \"I am, sir,\" replied a portly, red-faced Englishman, leaning out of the wheel-house window.  \"What'll you charge to land us in haste aboard the American battleship 'Massachusetts'?\" asked Darrin eagerly.  \"Half a sov. will be about right, sir,\" replied the tender's skipper, touching his cap at sight of the American Naval uniform.  \"Good enough,\" glowed Dave, leaping aboard. \"Cast off as quickly as you can, captain, or we'll be in a heap of trouble with our discipline officers.\"  The English skipper was quick to act. He routed out two deckhands, who quickly cast off. Almost while the deckhands were doing this the skipper rang the engineer's bell.  \"Come into the wheel-'ouse with me,\" invited the skipper pleasantly, which invitation the three middies accepted. \"Now, then, young gentlemen, 'ow did it 'appen that you missed your own launches.\"  \"It was a mean trick--a scoundrelly one!\" cried Darrin resentfully. Then he described just what had happened.  The skipper's own bronzed cheeks burned to a deeper color.  \"I can 'ardly believe that an Englishman would play such a trick on young h'officers of a friendly power,\" he declared. \"But I told you, sir, the fare out to your ship would be half a sov. I lied. If a nasty little cockney played such a trick on you, it's my place, as a decent Englishman, to take you out for nothing--and that's the fare.\"  \"Oh, we'll gladly pay the half sov.\" protested Darrin.  \"Not on this craft you can't, sir,\" replied the skipper firmly.  Looking eagerly ahead, the three middies saw two of the launches go along side of the \"Massachusetts\" and discharge passengers. As the second left the side gangway the Briton, who had been crowding on steam well, ranged in along side.  \"What craft is that, and what do you want?\" hailed the officer of the deck, from above.  \"The tender 'Lurline,' sir, with three of your gentlemen to put h'aboard of you, sir,\" the Briton bellowed through a window of the wheel-house.  \"Very good, then. Come alongside,\" directed the officer of the deck.  In his most seamanlike style the Briton ranged alongside. Dave tried to press the fare upon the skipper, but he would have none of that. So the three shook hands swiftly but heartily with him, then sprang across to the side gangway, where they paused long enough to lift their caps to this stranger and friend. The Briton lifted his own cap, waving it heartily, ere he fell off and turned about.  \"You didn't get aboard any too soon, gentlemen,\" remarked the officer of the deck, eyeing the three middies keenly as they came up over the side, doffing their uniform caps to the colors. \"Hustle for the formation.\"  Midshipman Pennington was chuckling deeply over the supposed fact that he had at last succeeded in bringing Darrin in for as many demerits as Darrin had helped heap upon him.  \"That'll break his heart as an avowed greaser,\" Pen told himself. \"With all the demerits Darrin will get, he'll have no heart for greasing the rest of this year. It's rough on Farley, but I'm not quite as sorry for Dalzell, who, in his way, is almost as bad as Darrin. He's Darrin's cuckoo and shadow, anyway. Oh, I wish I could see Darrin's face now!\"  This last was uttered just as Midshipman Pennington stepped into line at the supper formation.  \"I wish I could see Darrin's face now!\" Pen repeated to himself.  Seldom has a wish been more quickly gratified. For, just in the nick of time to avoid being reported, Midshipmen Darrin, Dalzell and Farley came into sight, falling into their respective places.  At that instant it was Midshipman Pennington's face, not Dave Darrin's, that was really worth studying.  \"Now how did the shameless greaser work this!\" Pennington pondered uneasily.  But, of course, he couldn't ask. He could only hope that, presently, he would hear the whole story from some other man in the class.
