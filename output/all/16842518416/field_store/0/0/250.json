I know another way of making his skin smart.\"  Dave tarried only long enough to make sure that the fop did not care to carry the encounter further. Then, turning on his heel, he walked rapidly in the direction Belle had taken. He overtook that young lady before she reached the Bentley home.  [Illustration: Darrin's Blow Felled the Fop to the Ground.]  \"If the fellow intends to trouble you again, I hope he'll do it before my leave is finished,\" spoke Dave quietly. \"I think I've given him a little lesson, Belle, though there's no telling how long it will last with inferior animals of Ardmore's type.\"  \"He's a spiteful fellow, Dave. You must be on your guard against him,\" Belle urged.  \"I guess Ardmore is wishing his own guard had been more effective,\" smiled the midshipman.  Caspar Ardmore was \"busy\" within an hour after Dave's summary handling of him. Ardmore had never been considered a truly bad fellow, though he was foppish, conceited and wholly unable to understand why anything that he wanted should be denied him. Belle was now two years beyond her High School days, and had developed into a most attractive young woman. Ardmore had fallen victim to her charms and had decided that he would make a better husband for her than any Naval officer could. Hence the young dandy had pursued Miss Meade with his attentions; upon finding her with Dave, he had hoped, in his foolish way, to put an end to Darrin's pretensions.  Ardmore, therefore, having met only disaster, was now engaged in drawing up a complaint to be sent to the Secretary of the Navy, complaining that he had been set upon and treated with severe physical violence by Midshipman Darrin.  Nor was there great difficulty in finding three men, out of the small crowd that had witnessed the assault, to swear to affidavits that they had seen Darrin knock Caspar Ardmore down repeatedly.  All this \"evidence\" Ardmore got together with great relish, and mailed the mass of stuff, that same night, to the Secretary of the Navy at Washington.  Then Ardmore went out of town for three days. Behind him he left an active toady who promised to keep watch of matters and to advise him.  It was through this toady that Dave received an intimation that his case would be attended to at Washington. Belle, also, received a hint, and with it she went to Darrin.  \"Can the fellow really make any trouble for you, Dave?\" she asked anxiously.  \"Why, yes,\" admitted Dave. \"Anyone can make trouble for a midshipman, to the extent that the charge must be investigated by the Navy Department. If the Secretary were satisfied that I am a reckless sort of bully, he would decide that I am unfit to be an officer of the Navy.\"     CHAPTER IV  IN THE VIEW OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT   Dave Darrin did not let the news of the charges disturb his outward serenity, though he was inwardly aware that perjured evidence might work great harm to his future career.  Until he was advised by the Navy Department that charges had been made against him, he really could do nothing in the matter.  But that letter from the Secretary was not long in coming. The letter informed Midshipman Darrin that he has been accused of severely assaulting a citizen without just provocation, and contained, also, some of the circumstances alleged by Caspar Ardmore. Dave was commanded to forward his defense promptly.  This Darrin did, in a courteous answer, as briefly as he could properly make it. He admitted knocking Ardmore down, but stated that he did it in resenting an insult offered by Ardmore to a young lady under his (Darrin's) escort at the time.  This letter he showed Belle.  \"It is the first step, on my side in the matter,\" he explained with a smile.  \"I should think the Secretary of the Navy ought to be satisfied with your answer and drop it at once,\" replied Belle.  \"He may.\"  \"But you think he won't?\"  \"It is likely, Belle, that there will be a court of inquiry at least.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Belle, a few tears gleaming in her eyes now. \"Why should so much fuss be made over the matter?\"  \"Because I am being trained to be an officer in the Navy. An officer must be a gentleman as well. Any charge affecting a Naval officer's honor or courtesy must be investigated, in order that the government may know whether the accused is fit to hold an officer's commission. The government wouldn't be dealing justly with the people if such standards were not observed.\"  \"And I am the cause of all this trouble for you?\" cried Belle.  \"No, Belle, you are not. You have nothing to do with the matter, except indirectly. Ardmore is the one responsible for the trouble. If he had not insulted you he wouldn't have gotten into any difficulty.\"  \"It seems too bad, just the same.\"  \"It's annoying; that's all,\" Dave assured her. \"If I had to do the same thing over again, for the same reason, I'd do it cheerfully.\"  Mrs. Meade heard of it all, from her daughter. Without saying a word as to her intentions the mother herself wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy. Mrs. Meade set forth the persistent fashion in which Ardmore had sought to force his attentions upon Belle, to the latter's great annoyance. Mrs. Meade's letter declared that Darrin had taken the only possible means of saving Belle from future annoyance. The mother's letter to the Secretary concluded by offering to procure statements from other people on the subject if the Secretary wished.  Mrs. Meade received a prompt reply from Washington. The Secretary thanked her for her statements and expressed entire belief in them.  By the same mail Caspar Ardmore, just returned to Gridley, received this letter:  \"Referring to your letter and complaint bearing date of September 6, the Department has to advise you that other statements have also been received bearing upon your accusations of an assault alleged to have been committed upon your person by Midshipman David Darrin.  \"It is claimed by the signers of other statements, including that of Midshipman Darrin, that you grossly insulted a young woman under his escort and completed the insult by accusing her of falsehood. If these statements be true, and there be no other important circumstances, except the assault, the Department begs to advise you that, had not Midshipman Darrin resented the gross insult tendered the woman under his protection, he would thereby, by such inaction, have rendered himself liable to dismissal from the Navy. It is always the first duty of a gentleman to afford ample protection to any woman under his escort and care.  \"Should you deny the statements quoted above in favor of Midshipman Darrin, and should you further desire to have the matter brought to issue before a duly appointed court of inquiry, before which you would be required to appear as a material witness, this Department will be glad so to be advised. If you do not make formal application for the appointment of such court of inquiry within the next few days, no further action will be taken in the matter. Very respectfully,  \"Your obedient servant, \"(Signed) LEOK B. CHAMBERS, \"_Secretary of the Navy_.\"  As he read, and realized how flat his charge had fallen, Ardmore's face passed through several shades of red.  \"Of all the government red tape!\" he muttered wrathfully. \"I didn't think the fool Secretary would do anything like this. I thought he'd just call Darrin down hard and plenty, and perhaps bounce him out of the Naval Academy. Humph! I guess all these Navy folks stand together. There doesn't seem to be much justice about it.\"  Ardmore thereupon took another vacation away from Gridley. A few days after he went Midshipman Darrin received a brief communication from the Secretary of the Navy, stating that no further action had been taken by the accuser, and that the Department was satisfied that the midshipman's conduct had been fully justified. Therefore the matter would not be called to the attention of the Naval Academy authorities for action.  \"So you see,\" smiled Dave, as he called at Belle's home and handed her the letter, \"there is never any need to be worried until trouble breaks in earnest.\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad!\" cried Belle, her eyes shining with delight, \"I hope you won't meet that Ardmore fellow again while you're home.\"  \"If I do,\" promised Dave, \"I shall merely look over his head when we meet, unless he repeats the offense that brought him that thrashing.\"  Ardmore, however, did not appear in Gridley again during Dave's leave of absence.  Dave and Dan tasted, to the full, the delights of life in the old home town until the day when it was necessary for them to take train and return to Annapolis.  \"Mother, Laura and I will go down to Annapolis whenever we hear from you as to the best time for coming,\" Miss Meade promised at the railway station.  Then she found chance to murmur, in a voice too low for any of the others present to hear:  \"And I'll try hard not to be such a goose as I was last winter!\"  She referred to the trouble that had been made by another girl at Annapolis, the circumstances of which are wholly familiar to the readers of the earlier volumes of this series.  \"I don't blame you for the way you felt last winter,\" Dave assured her heartily, \"Next time, however, I hope you'll come to me first for an explanation.\"  \"There isn't going to be any next time, Dave.\"  Three minutes later two midshipmen were being whirled through the city limits of Gridley.     CHAPTER V  NAVY FOOTBALL IN THE AIR   Back on the old, familiar Academy grounds!  Both Dave and Dan underwent an unconscious brace as they passed the watchman at the main gate and stepped on, each with a suit case in hand, to the left, with Bancroft Hall in the distance.  Their first move was, as it must be, to report their return to the officer in charge. By that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10319"],["title","Dave Darrin's Third Year at Annapolis; Or, Leaders of the Second Class (#6)"],["body","the two midshipmen were assigned to the rooms that they were to occupy during the coming academic year.  Once behind their doors, both young men hastened to get out of cit. clothes and back into their beloved uniforms.  \"There are worse liveries to wear than Uncle Sam's,\" murmured Dan Dalzell when, having arrayed himself, he glanced down lovingly at the neat, dark blue.  \"Much worse,\" replied Dave briefly, as, having dressed, he set to work to help make their quarters neat enough to please even the captious eye of the discipline officer. By the time that the two midshipmen finished policing their quarters no housekeeper in the land could have found the least sign of disorder.  Rap-tap! sounded briskly at the door.  \"Come in,\" called Dave.  The door opened, revealing Midshipman Hepson, of the first class.  \"Are you fellows to rights?\" he called.  \"Come in, Hepson,\" urged Dave. \"Yes; we're to rights as far as quarters go.\"  Hepson came no more than inside the door before he halted, asking briskly:  \"Have you anything on!\"  \"Nothing but our clothes,\" grinned Dan, \"and some hair.\"  \"You've no appointments or engagements, then?\" persisted Hepson. \"My being here won't interfere with anything that you want to do?\"  \"Not in the least,\" Dave replied.  \"Oh, then, I'll invite myself to a chair,\" declared the first classman, suiting the action to the word. \"Now, you fellows can guess why I'm here.\"  \"You're captain of this year's football eleven,\" Dave replied. \"Has that anything to do with your call?\"  \"Everything,\" admitted Hepson briskly. \"Have you fellows any notion that we've a poor eleven, so far, this year?\"  \"Why I thought it pretty good, from the practice work that I saw done in August,\" Darrin answered slowly.  \"A pretty good eleven doesn't win games, sir,\" retorted Hepson. \"Man, we've got to strengthen the team all along the line, or I'll go down in Naval Academy history as captain of the worst lot of dubs who ever chased a pigskin around the field!\"  \"Is it as bad as that?\" demanded Dan, opening his eyes.  \"Dalzell,\" said Hepson, \"our eleven is rotten, sir--simply and fiercely useless!\"  \"If it's as bad as that,\" hinted Dan innocently, \"wouldn't it be a prime good idea to draw our eleven from the field this year?\"  \"What? Strike the Navy's colors, and especially to the Army?\" glared Mr. Hepson. \"What are you talking about?\"  \"Then I guess,\" nodded Dan, \"that we'll have to stay in the ring, and let it go by apologizing to the Army for getting in their way on the field the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\"  \"We won't do that, either, by Jingo!\" retorted Midshipman Hepson. \"But we've got to strengthen our team. We've got to practice every minute that the commandant will allow us for practice. We've got to make a front-rank team out of--nearly nothing!\"  \"Aren't there any good players who have been holding back?\" asked Dave Darrin.  \"Two that I know of, Darrin,\" rejoined Hepson, fixing his eyes keenly on Dave.  \"Who are they?\"  \"You and Dalzell.\"  \"We haven't backed out, or refused duty,\" Darrin retorted quickly.  \"No; but you haven't pushed yourselves forward any, either.\"  \"Well, we're hardly team material,\" objected Dave modestly. \"However, I'll promise for myself and Dalzell, too, that we'll turn out to all the practice we can, and work like blazes!\"  \"Will you?\" cried Midshipman Hepson delightedly. He jumped up, grasping each midshipman by the hand in turn.  \"But you don't want to bank on us too much,\" Darrin continued. \"You know, we've never played on anything as big as the Navy team. We used to be good enough little players on a country school team. But it's different here.\"  \"Let the coaches and the captain find that out, then,\" grunted Hepson. \"But you'll work? You'll try to make good? You'll try to make the team and some history?\"  \"We'd lay down our lives for the Navy, at any point and in any sort of game,\" rejoined Dave Darrin simply.  \"Good! Bully! That's the way I like to hear a fellow talk!\" glowed Hepson, making toward the door. \"You'll turn out for practice to-morrow afternoon?\"  \"Without fail, if we're physically able,\" promised Midshipman Darrin.  \"Awfully obliged to you, fellows,\" cried Hepson, throwing the door open. \"And now you won't mind if I cut my visit short? I've a lot of fellows to see, you know.\"  The door banged and Hepson was gone.  \"Say, how's the Navy going to win under a chap as nervous as Hepson?\" asked Dan.  \"That isn't nervousness, Danny boy.\"  \"If it isn't, what is it, then?\"  \"Electricity.\"  \"Elec--Oh, say, now--\"  \"It's electricity,\" Dave insisted. \"He's a live wire, that man Hepson. He'll pull us through on the field this year, if any one can.\"  \"There's nothing like looking on the bright side of things,\" murmured Dalzell, drumming on his chair.  \"I'd rather see Hepson under estimate the Navy team,\" went on Dave, \"than feel too sure that it is invincible. Still, I believe that the Navy is going to put forward a mighty strong eleven this year. Though, of course, that is not saying that we can beat the Army.\"  \"Why not?\" demanded Dalzell almost fiercely.  \"Because, no matter how good a line we put forward, the Army may put forward a better.\"  \"Now, don't go tooting the Army's bugle!\"  \"I am just considering the average of chances,\" Darrin returned. \"Danny boy, sometimes the Navy wins, but most of the games of past years have gone to the Army. So the chances are that we'll be beaten this year.\"  \"Not if I have to die on the line to stop it!\" glowed Dalzell at red heat.  \"Maybe you won't even get on the Navy line; perhaps I won't, either, Danny boy. But you know we saw by the \"Army and Navy Journal\" that Prescott and Holmes are playing on the West Point eleven this year.\"  \"Holmes isn't necessarily such a much, is he?\" flared Dan.  \"Greg Holmes is a pretty handy man on the football field,\" retorted Darrin warmly. \"None ought to know that better than we, after we've seen Holmes pull out so many victories for the old High School team. Of course, Prescott is the better player, but Holmes can back him up to amazing advantage.\"  \"Didn't we play about as good a game as that pair?\" Dalzell demanded.  \"I don't know,\" Dave answered thoughtfully. \"Perhaps not quite as good a game. You see, in the old High School days, Dick Prescott used to lead and I often backed up his plays. So one could hardly compare us.\"  \"If you're in such a blue funk over the Navy's chances, you'd better keep off the line-up,\" muttered Midshipman Dalzell.  \"Oh, I'm in no funk,\" returned Darrin, smiling. \"However, I'm not going to be betrayed into any bragging until we've wiped the field up with the Army--if we can.\"  Rap-tap! came on the door.  \"I'll wager that's Farley,\" whispered Darrin.  \"Or Page\"--from Dan.  \"Come in,\" called Dave.  The door opened, to let in Farley, with Page crowding on his heels.  Dave and Dan both hastened forward to clasp hands with these tried chums of other days.  \"Seen Hepson?\" asked Dan.  \"Yes,\" nodded Farley. \"He told us he had gobbled you. Hepson just left us.\"  \"You're going to be on the eleven!\" pressed Dan.  \"If we can make it,\" nodded Farley slowly. \"I'd like to play, too, but I'm hoping that the Navy can hit on some one better than myself.\"  \"Cold feet!\" grinned Dan.  \"Not exactly,\" Farley answered, with a slight flush. \"But it's a big thing to play on the Navy's fighting eleven. It seems almost too big a responsibility for any but a demi-god.\"  \"Demi-gods don't play football,\" jeered Dan. \"They're nothing but idols, anyway, and they're two thousand years out of date. What we want on the Navy line is real human flesh and blood.\"  \"There'll be blood on the doorstep of the moon if the Army carries things away from us this year,\" predicted Page mournfully.  \"Well, all we can do is our best,\" declared Dave. \"We'll do that, too, and do it mightily. Wow! What's that?\"  Ta-ra-ra-ta-ra-ta! sounded musically in the corridors.  \"Supper formation, by Jove!\" gasped Dan.  Farley and Page fled without a word. Soon the \"decks\" of Bancroft Hall swarmed with young life. Then, outside, to seaward, the brigade fell in by companies.  Military commands rang out briskly, roll was called, reports made and the brigade marched in to supper.  What a joyous, noisy affair it was. Some license in the way of boisterousness was allowed this evening, and most of the young men took full advantage of the fact.  Swat! A slice of bread, soaked in a glass of water and kneaded into a soppy ball, struck Dalzell full in the back of the neck, plastering his collar and sending a sticky mess down his spine.  \"I'll fight the man who did that,\" promised Midshipman Dan, wheeling around. Then added cautiously:  \"If he's a graduate.\"  There being, naturally, no graduates present except the officer at the furthest corner of the mess hall, Dan's challenge provoked laughter.  Many other pranks were played, but there is not room to record them here. The meal over and the brigade dismissed, some of the midshipmen--there were nearly eight hundred of them--went to their own quarters, or visited the rooms of cronies. Hundreds took the air in the grounds.  Almost the sole topic was football. Hepson speedily had most of the members of the big squad gathered about him. Others, who could not hope to \"make\" in football, gathered near-by, as though afraid of losing some of the talk.  \"Remember, gentlemen, until the Army game is over, it's to be nothing this year but work, work, work!\" warned Midshipman Hepson, with intense earnestness.  With nothing but football in the air, Dan soon caught the infection even more deeply than his chum.  \"Hang it, I'm a dub,\" groaned Dan. \"Lots of the fellows gave up their leave in order to be here and practise. Why in the mischief didn't I?\"  \"For the same reason that perhaps I didn't sacrifice leave,\" replied Dave. \"I wasn't asked to. And you weren't, either, were you?\"  \"No; but I wish I had flung myself at Hepson's head, and made him take me, instead of going off to Gridley like a deserter! It's"]]]
