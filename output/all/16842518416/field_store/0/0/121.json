It will appear  at last, as that great day of days, which will conclude, so we believe,  the drama of human history, and all men shall give account for their own  works.  But, however and whenever it shall appear, they at least will  watch its dawning, neither with the selfish assurance of modern  Pharisaism, nor with the abject terror of mediaeval superstition; but  with that manful faith with which he who sang the 98th Psalm saw the day  of the Lord dawn once in the far east, more than two thousand years ago,  and cried with solemn joy, in the glorious words which you have just  heard sung--words which the Church of England has embodied in her daily  evening service, in order, I presume, to show her true children how they  ought to look at days of judgment; and so prepare to meet their God:--  \"Show yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands:  sing, rejoice, and  give thanks.  \"Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is:  the round world, and  they that dwell therein.  \"Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together  before the Lord:  for He cometh to judge the earth.  \"With righteousness shall He judge the world:  and the people with  equity.  \"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;  \"As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.   Amen.\"    SERMON III.  THE PURIFYING HOPE    Eversley, 1869.  Windsor Castle, 1869.  1 John iii. 2.  \"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet  appear what we shall be:  but we know that, when he shall appear, we  shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.  And every man that  hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\"  Let us consider this noble text, and see something, at least, of what it  has to tell us.  It is, like all God's messages, all God's laws, ay, like  God's world in which we live and breathe, at once beautiful and awful;  full of life-giving hope; but full, too, of chastening fear.  Hope for  the glorious future which it opens to poor human beings like us; fear,  lest so great a promise being left us, we should fall short of it by our  own fault.  Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us,  that we should be called the sons of God.  There is the root and beginning of all Christianity,--of all true  religion.  We are the sons of God, and the infinite, absolute, eternal  Being who made this world, and all worlds, is our Father.  We are the  children of God.  It is not for us to say who are not God's children.   That is God's concern, not ours.  All that we have to do with, is the  awful and blessed fact that we are.  We were baptised into God's kingdom,  in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Let us  believe the Gospel and good news which baptism brings us, and say each of  us;--Not for our own goodness and deserving; not for our own faith or  assurance; not for anything which we have thought, felt, or done, but  simply out of the free grace and love of God, seeking out us unconscious  infants, we are children of God.  \"Beloved now are we the sons of God,  and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.\"  It doth not yet appear  what the next life will be like, or what we shall be like in it.  That  there will be a next life,--that death does not end all for us, the New  Testament tells us.  Yea, our own hearts and reasons tell us.  That  sentiment of immortality, that instinct that the death of our body will  not, cannot destroy our souls, or ourselves--all men have had that,  except a few; and it is a question whether they had it not once, and have  only lost it by giving way to their brute animal nature.  But be that as  it may, it concerns us, I think, very little.  For we at least believe  that we shall live again.  That we shall live again in some state or  other, is as certain to our minds as it was to the minds of our  forefathers, even while they were heathens; as certain to us as it is  that we are alive now.  But in that future state, what we shall be like,  we know not.  St. John says that he did not know; and we certainly have  no more means of knowing than St. John.  Therefore let us not feed our fancies with pictures of what the next  world will be like,--pictures, I say, which are but waking dreams of men,  intruding into those things which they have not seen, vainly puffed up in  their fleshly minds--that is in their animal and mortal brain.  Let us be  content with what St. John tells us, which is a matter not for our  brains, but for our hearts; not for our imaginations, but for our  conscience, which is indeed our highest reason.  Whatever we do not know  about the next world, this, he says, we do know,--that when God in Christ  shall appear, we shall be like Him.  Like God.  No more:  No:  but no  less.  To be like God, it appears, is the very end and aim of our being.   That we might be like God, God our Father sent us forth from His eternal  bosom, which is the ground of all life, in heaven and in earth.  That we  might be like God, He clothed us in mortal flesh, and sent us into this  world of sense.  That we might be like God, He called us, from our  infancy, into His Church.  That we might be like God, He gave us the  divine sense of right and wrong; and more, by the inspiration of His holy  spirit, that inward witness, that Light of God, which lightens every man  that cometh into the world, He taught us to love the right and hate the  wrong.  That we might be like God, God is educating us from our cradle to  our grave, by every event, even the smallest, which happens to us.  That  we might be like God, it is in God that we live, and move, and have our  being; that as the raindrop which falls from heaven, rises again surely,  soon or late, to heaven again; so each soul of man, coming forth from God  at first, should return again to God, as many of them as have eternal  life, having become like to God from whom it came at first.  And how  shall we become like God? or rather like Christ who is both God and man?   To become like God the Father,--that is impossible for finite and created  beings as we are.  But to become somewhat, at least, like God the Son,  like Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the brightness of His Father's glory,  and the express image of His person, that is not impossible.  For He has  revealed Himself as a man, in the soul and body of a man, that our sinful  souls might be made like His pure soul; our sinful bodies like His  glorious body; and that so He might be the first born among many  brethren.  And how?  \"We know that when He appears, we shall be like Him,  for we shall see Him as He is.\"  For we shall see Him as He is.  Herein is a great mystery, and one which  I do not pretend to fathom.  Only this I can try to do--to shew how it  may seem possible and reasonable, from what is called analogy, that is by  judging of an unknown thing from a known thing, which is, at least,  something like it.  Now do we not all know how apt we are to become like  those whom we see, with whom we spend our hours--and, above all, like  those whom we admire and honour?  For good and for evil, alas!  For evil- -for those who associate with evil or frivolous persons are too apt to  catch not only their low tone, but their very manner, their very  expression of face, speaking, and thinking, and acting.  Not only do they  become scornful, if they live with scorners; false, if they live with  liars; mean, if they live with covetous men; but they will actually catch  the very look of their faces.  The companions of affected, frivolous  people, men or women, grow to look affected frivolous.  Indulging in the  same passions, they mould their own countenances and their very walk,  also the very tones of their voice, as well as their dress, into the  likeness of those with whom they associate, nay, of those whose fashions  (as they are called) they know merely by books and pictures.  But thank  God, who has put into the hearts of Christian people the tendency towards  God--just in the same way does good company tend to make men good; high- minded company to make them high-minded; kindly company to make them  kindly; modest company to make them modest; honourable company to make  them honourable; and pure company to make them pure.  If the young man or  woman live with such, look up to such as their ideal, that is, the  pattern which they ought to emulate--then, as a fact, the Spirit of God  working in them does mould them into something of the likeness of those  whom they admire and love.  I have lived long enough to see more than one  man of real genius stamp his own character, thought, even his very manner  of speaking, for good or for evil, on a whole school or party of his  disciples.  It has been said, and truly, I believe, that children cannot  be brought up among beautiful pictures,--I believe, even among any  beautiful sights and sounds,--without the very expression of their faces  becoming more beautiful, purer, gentler, nobler; so that in them are  fulfilled the words of the great and holy Poet concerning the maiden  brought up according to God, and the laws of God--      \"And she shall bend her ear    In many a secret place, Where rivulets dance their wayward round, And beauty, born of murmuring sound,    Shall pass into her face.\"   But if mere human beings can have this \"personal influence,\" as it is  called, over each others' characters, if even inanimate things, if they  be beautiful, can have it--what must be the personal influence of our  Lord Jesus Christ?  Of Him, who is the Man of all men, the Son of Man,  the perfect and ideal Man--and more, who is very God of very God; the  Author of all life, power, wisdom, genius, in every human being, whether  they use to good, or abuse to ill, His divine gifts; the Author, too, of  all natural beauty, from the sun over our heads to the flower beneath our  feet?  Think of that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10116"],["title","All Saints' Day and Other Sermons (#4)"],["body","eadily, accurately, rationally.  Think of who  Christ is, and what Christ is--and then think what His personal influence  must be--quite infinite, boundless, miraculous.  So that the very  blessedness of heaven will not be merely the sight of our Lord; it will  be the being made holy, and kept holy, by that sight.  If only we be fit  for it.  For let us ask ourselves the question,--If St John's words come  true of us, if we should see Him as He is, would the sight of His all- glorious countenance warm us into such life, love, longing for virtue and  usefulness, as we never felt before?  Or would it crush us into the very  earth with utter shame and humiliation, full and awful knowledge of how  weak and foolish, sinful and unworthy we were?--as it does to Gerontius  in the poem, when he dreams that, after death, he demanded, rashly and  ambitiously, to see our Lord, and had his wish.  That is the question which every one must try to answer for himself in  fear and trembling, for, he that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself,  even as He is pure.  The common sense of men--which is often their  conscience and highest reason--has taught them this, more or less  clearly, in all countries and all ages.  There are very few religions  which have not made purifying of some kind a part of their duty.  The  very savage, when he enters (as he fancies) the presence of his god, will  wash and adorn himself that he may be fit, poor creature, for meeting the  paltry god which he has invented out of his own brain; and he is right as  far as he goes.  The Englishman, when he dresses himself in his best to  go to church, obeys the same reasonable instinct.  And, indeed, is not  holy baptism a sign that this instinct is a true one?--that if God be  pure, he who enters the presence of God must purify himself, even as God  is pure?  Else why, when each person, whether infant or adult, is  received into Christ's Church, is washing with water, whether by  sprinkling, as now, or, as of old, by immersion, the very sign and  sacrament of his being received into God's kingdom?  The instinct, I say,  is reasonable, and has its root in the very heart of man.  Whatsoever we  respect and admire we shall also try to copy, if it be only for a time.   If we are going into the presence of a wiser man than ourselves, we shall  surely recollect and summon up what little wisdom or knowledge we may  have; if into the presence of a holier person, we shall try to call up in  ourselves those better and more serious thoughts which we so often  forget, that we may be, even for a few minutes, fit for that good  company.  And if we go into the presence of a purer person than  ourselves, we shall surely (unless we be base and brutal) call up our  purest and noblest thoughts, and try to purify ourselves, even as they  are pure.  It is true what poets have said again and again, that there  are women whose mere presence, whose mere look, drives all bad thoughts  away--women before whom men dare no more speak, or act, nay, even think,  basely, than they would dare before the angels of God.  But if it be so--and so it is--what must we be, to be fit to appear  before Him who is Purity itself?--before that spotless Christ in whom is  no sin and who knows what is in man; who is quick and piercing as a two- edged sword, even to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, so  that all things are naked and open in the sight of Him with whom we have  to do?  What purity can we bring into His presence which will not seem  impure to Him?  What wisdom which will not seem folly?  What humility  which will not seem self-conceit?  What justice which will not seem  unjust?  What love which will not seem hardness of heart, in the sight of  Him who charges His angels with folly, and the very heavens are not clean  in His sight?  Who loved Him better, and whom did He love better, than St  John?  Yet, what befel St John when, in the spirit, he saw Him even  somewhat as He is?--\"And I fell at His feet as dead.\"  If St John himself  was struck down with awe, what shall we feel, even the best and purest  among us?  All we can do is to cast ourselves, now and for ever, in life,  in death, and in the day of judgment, on His boundless mercy and love-- who stooped from heaven to die for us and cry, God be merciful to me a  sinner.  Therefore, I have many fears for some who are ready enough to talk of  their fulness of hope and their assurance of salvation, and to join in  hymns which express weariness of this life and longings for the joys of  heaven, and prayers that they may depart and be with Christ.  If they are  not in earnest in such words they mock God; but if they are in earnest,  some of them, I fear much, tempt God.  What if He took them at their  word?  What if He gave them their wish?  What if they departed and  entered the presence of Christ, only to meet with a worse fate than that  of Gerontius?  Only to be overwhelmed with shame and terror, because,  though they have been talking of being with Christ, they have not been  trying to be like Christ; because they have not sought after holiness,  without which no man shall see the Lord; because they have not tried to  purify themselves, even as He is pure; and have, poor, heedless souls,  gone out of the world, with all their sins upon their head, to enter a  place for which they will find themselves utterly unfit, because it is a  place into which nothing can enter which defileth, or committeth  abomination, or maketh a lie, and from which the covetous are specially  excluded; and in which will be fulfilled the parable of the man who came  to the feast, not having on a wedding garment,--Take him, bind him hand  and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness.  There shall be wailing  and gnashing of teeth.  Assurance, my friends, may be reasonable enough when it is founded on  repentance and hatred of evil, and love and practice of what is good.   But, again, assurance may be as unreasonable as it is offensive.  We  blame a man who has too much assurance about earthly things.  Let us  beware that we have not too much assurance about heavenly things.  For  our assurance will surely be too great, unreasonable, built upon the  sand, if it be built on mere self-conceit of our own orthodoxy, and our  own privileges, or our own special connection with God.  Meanwhile it has been my comfort to meet with some--would God they were  more numerous--who, instead of talking of their assurance of salvation,  lived in a state of noble self-discontent and holy humility; who could  see nothing but their own faults and failings; who, though they were  holier than others, considered themselves as unholy; though they were  doing more good than others, thought themselves useless; whose standard  of duty was so lofty, that they could think of nothing, but how far they  had failed in reaching it; who measured themselves, not by other men, but  by Christ Himself; and, doing that, had nought to say, save, \"God be  merciful to me a sinner.\"  And for such people I have had full assurance,  just because they had no assurance themselves.  And I have said in my  heart, These are worthy, just because they think themselves unworthy.   These are fit to appear in the presence of God, just because they believe  themselves unfit.  These are they who will cry at the day of judgment, in  wondering humility,--Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or naked,  or in prison, and visited Thee?  And will receive for answer,--\"Inasmuch  as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have  done it unto Me.\"  \"Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will  make thee ruler over many things.  Enter into the joy of thy Lord.\"  To which end may God of His mercy bring us, and all we love.  Amen.    SERMON IV.  THE LORD COMING TO HIS TEMPLE    Westminster Abbey.  November, 1874.  Malachi iii. 1, 2.  \"The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His  temple. . . .  But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall  stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire, and like  fuller's sope.\"  We believe that this prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of our  Lord Jesus Christ.  We believe that it will be fulfilled again, in that  great day when He shall judge the quick and the dead.  But it is of  neither of these events I wish to speak to you just now.  I wish to speak  of an event which has not (as far as we know) happened; which will  probably never happen; but which is still perfectly possible; and one,  too, which it is good for us to face now and then, and ask ourselves, If  this thing came to pass, what should I think, and what should I do?  I shall touch the question with all reverence and caution.  I shall try  to tread lightly, as one who is indeed on hallowed ground.  For the  question which I have dared to ask you and myself is none other than  this--If the Lord suddenly came to this temple, or any other in this  land; if He appeared among us, as He did in Judea eighteen hundred years  ago, what should we think of Him?  Should we recognise, or should we  reject, our Saviour and our Lord?  It is an awful thought, the more we  look at it.  But for that very reason it may be the more fit to be asked,  once and for all.  Now, to put this question safely and honestly, we must keep within those  words which I just said--as He appeared in Judea eighteen hundred years  ago.  We must limit our fancy to the historic Christ, to the sayings,  doings, character which are handed down to us in the four Gospels; and  ask ourselves nothing but--What should I think if such a personage were  to meet me now?  To imagine Him--as has been too often done--as doing  deeds, speaking words, and even worse, entertaining motives, which are  not written in the four Gospels, is as unfair morally, as it is illogical  critically.  It creates a phantom, a fictitious character, and calls that  Christ.  It makes each writer, each thinker--or rather"]]]
