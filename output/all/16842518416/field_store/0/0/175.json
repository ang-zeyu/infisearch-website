[94] (1) Thus the true method of discovery is to form thoughts from some given definition.  (2) This process will be the more fruitful and easy in proportion as the thing given be better defined.  (3) Wherefore, the cardinal point of all this second part of method consists in the knowledge of the conditions of good definition, and the means of finding them.  (4) I will first treat of the conditions of definition.  [95]  (1) A definition, if it is to be called perfect, must explain the inmost essence of a thing, and must take care not to substitute for this any of its properties.  (2) In order to illustrate my meaning, without taking an example which would seem to show a desire to expose other people's errors, I will choose the case of something abstract, the definition of which is of little moment.  (95:3) Such is a circle.  (4) If a circle be defined as a figure, such that all straight lines drawn from the center to the circumference are equal, every one can see that such a definition does not in the least explain the essence of a circle, but solely one of its properties.  (5) Though, as I have said, this is of no importance in the case of figures and other abstractions, it is of great importance in the case of physical beings and realities: for the properties of things are not understood so long as their essences are unknown. (6) If the latter be passed over, there is necessarily a perversion of the succession of ideas which should reflect the succession of nature, and we go far astray from our object.  [96]  In order to be free from this fault, the following rules should be observed in definition:--  I.  (1) If the thing in question be created, the definition    must (as we have said) comprehend the proximate cause.    (2) For instance, a circle should, according to this rule,    be defined as follows: the figure described by any line    whereof one end is fixed and the other free.  (3) This    definition clearly comprehends the proximate cause.  II.  (4) A conception or definition of a thing should be such    that all the properties of that thing, in so far as it is    considered by itself, and not in conjunction with other    things, can be deduced from it, as may be seen in the    definition given of a circle: for from that it clearly follows    that all straight lines drawn from the center to the    circumference are equal.  (5) That this is a necessary    characteristic of a definition is so clear to anyone, who    reflects on the matter, that there is no need to spend time    in proving it, or in showing that, owing to this second    condition, every definition should be affirmative.  (6) I    speak of intellectual affirmation, giving little thought to    verbal affirmations which, owing to the poverty of language,    must sometimes, perhaps, be expressed negatively, though    the idea contained is affirmative.  [97]  The rules for the definition of an uncreated thing are as follows:--  I.  The exclusion of all idea of cause--that is, the thing    must not need explanation by Anything outside itself.  II. When the definition of the thing has been given, there must    be no room for doubt as to whether the thing exists or not.  III. It must contain, as far as the mind is concerned, no    substantives which could be put into an adjectival form;    in other words, the object defined must not be explained    through abstractions.  IV. Lastly, though this is not absolutely necessary, it should    be possible to deduce from the definition all the properties    of the thing defined.  All these rules become obvious to anyone giving strict attention to the matter.  [98]  (1) I have also stated that the best basis for drawing a conclusion is a particular affirmative essence.  (2) The more specialized the idea is, the more it is distinct, and therefore clear.  (3) Wherefore a knowledge of particular things should be sought for as diligently as possible.  [99]  (1) As regards the order of our perceptions, and the manner in which they should be arranged and united, it is necessary that, as soon as is possible and rational, we should inquire whether there be any being (and, if so, what being), that is the cause of all things, so that its essence, represented in thought, may be the cause of all our ideas, and then our mind will to the utmost possible extent reflect nature. (2) For it will possess, subjectively, nature's essence, order, and union.  (3) Thus we can see that it is before all things necessary for us to deduce all our ideas from physical things--that is, from real entities, proceeding, as far as may be, according to the series of causes, from one real entity to another real entity, never passing to universals and abstractions, either for the purpose of deducing some real entity from them, or deducing them from some real entity.  (4) Either of these processes interrupts the true progress of the understanding.  [100]  (1) But it must be observed that, by the series of causes and real entities, I do not here mean the series of particular and mutable things, but only the series of fixed and eternal things. (2) It would be impossible for human infirmity to follow up the series of particular mutable things, both on account their multitude, surpassing all calculation, and on account of the infinitely diverse circumstances surrounding one and the same thing, any one of which may be the cause of its existence or non-existence.  (3) Indeed, their existence has no connection with their essence, or (as we have said already) is not an eternal truth.  [101] (1) Neither is there any need that we should understand their series, for the essences of particular mutable things are not to be gathered from their series or order of existence, which would furnish us with nothing beyond their extrinsic denominations, their relations, or, at most, their circumstances, all of which are very different from their inmost essence. (101:2) This inmost essence must be sought solely from fixed and eternal things, and from the laws, inscribed (so to speak) in those things as in their true codes, according to which all particular things take place and are arranged; nay, these mutable particular things depend so intimately and essentially (so to phrase it) upon the fixed things, that they cannot either be conceived without them.  [102]  (1) But, though this be so, there seems to be no small difficulty in arriving at the knowledge of these particular things, for to conceive them all at once would far surpass the powers of the human understanding.  (2) The arrangement whereby one thing is understood, before another, as we have stated, should not be sought from their series of existence, nor from eternal things.  (3) For the latter are all by nature simultaneous.  (4) Other aids are therefore needed besides those employed for understanding eternal things and their laws.  (5) However, this is not the place to recount such aids, nor is there any need to do so, until we have acquired a sufficient knowledge of eternal things and their infallible laws, and until the nature of our senses has become plain to us.  [103]  (1) Before betaking ourselves to seek knowledge of particular things, it will be seasonable to speak of such aids, as all tend to teach us the mode of employing our senses, and to make certain experiments under fixed rules and arrangements which may suffice to determine the object of our inquiry, so that we may therefrom infer what laws of eternal things it has been produced under, and may gain an insight into its inmost nature, as I will duly show.  (2) Here, to return to my purpose, I will only endeavor to set forth what seems necessary for enabling us to attain to knowledge of eternal things, and to define them under the conditions laid down above.  [104]  (1) With this end, we must bear in mind what has already been stated, namely, that when the mind devotes itself to any thought, so as to examine it, and to deduce therefrom in due order all the legitimate conclusions possible, any falsehood which may lurk in the thought will be detected; but if the thought be true, the mind will readily proceed without interruption to deduce truths from it. (104:2) This, I say, is necessary for our purpose, for our thoughts may be brought to a close by the absence of a foundation.  [105]  (1) If, therefore, we wish to investigate the first thing of all, it will be necessary to supply some foundation which may direct our thoughts thither.  (2) Further, since method is reflective knowledge, the foundation which must direct our thoughts can be nothing else than the knowledge of that which constitutes the reality of truth, and the knowledge of the understanding, its properties, and powers.  (3) When this has been acquired we shall possess a foundation wherefrom we can deduce our thoughts, and a path whereby the intellect, according to its capacity, may attain the knowledge of eternal things, allowance being made for the extent of the intellectual powers.  [106]  (1) If, as I stated in the first part, it belongs to the nature of thought to form true ideas, we must here inquire what is meant by the faculties and power of the understanding.  (2) The chief part of our method is to understand as well as possible the powers of the intellect, and its nature; we are, therefore, compelled (by the considerations advanced in the second part of the method) necessarily to draw these conclusions from the definition itself of thought and understanding.  [107]  (1) But, so far as we have not got any rules for finding definitions, and, as we cannot set forth such rules without a previous knowledge of nature, that is without a definition of the understanding and its power, it follows either that the definition of the understanding must be clear in itself, or that we can understand nothing.  (2)"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1016"],["title","On the Improvement of the Understanding (#8)"],["body","this definition is not absolutely clear in itself; however, since its properties, like all things that we possess through the understanding, cannot be known clearly and distinctly, unless its nature be known previously, understanding makes itself manifest, if we pay attention to its properties, which we know clearly and distinctly.  (3) Let us, then, enumerate here the properties of the understanding, let us examine them, and begin by discussing the instruments for research which we find innate in us. See [31]  [108]  (1) The properties of the understanding which I have chiefly remarked, and which I clearly understand, are the following:--  I. (2) It involves certainty--in other words, it knows that a thing    exists in reality as it is reflected subjectively.  II. (108:3) That it perceives certain things, or forms some ideas    absolutely, some ideas from others.  (4) Thus it forms the    idea of quantity absolutely, without reference to any other    thoughts; but ideas of motion it only forms after taking into    consideration the idea of quantity.  III. (108:5) Those ideas which the understanding forms absolutely    express infinity; determinate ideas are derived from other    ideas.  (6) Thus in the idea of quantity, perceived by means    of a cause, the quantity is determined, as when a body is    perceived to be formed by the motion of a plane, a plane by    the motion of a line, or, again, a line by the motion of a    point.  (7) All these are perceptions which do not serve    towards understanding quantity, but only towards determining    it.  (108:8) This is proved by the fact that we conceive them    as formed as it were by motion, yet this motion is not perceived    unless the quantity be perceived also; we can even prolong the    motion to form an infinite line, which we certainly could not do    unless we had an idea of infinite quantity.  IV. (9) The understanding forms positive ideas before forming    negative ideas.  V. (108:10) It perceives things not so much under the condition    of duration as under a certain form of eternity, and in an    infinite number; or rather in perceiving things it does not    consider either their number or duration, whereas, in imagining    them, it perceives them in a determinate number, duration, and    quantity.  VI. (108:11) The ideas which we form as clear and distinct, seem    to follow from the sole necessity of our nature, that they    appear to depend absolutely on our sole power; with confused    ideas the contrary is the case.  (12) They are often formed    against our will.  VII. (108:13) The mind can determine in many ways the ideas of things, which the understanding forms from other ideas: thus, for instance, in order to define the plane of an ellipse, it supposes a point adhering to a cord to be moved around two centers, or, again, it conceives an infinity of points, always in the same fixed relation to a given straight line, angle of the vertex of the cone, or in an infinity of other ways.  VIII. (108:14) The more ideas express perfection of any object, the more perfect are they themselves; for we do not admire the architect who has planned a chapel so much as the architect who has planned a splendid temple.  [109] (1) I do not stop to consider the rest of what is referred to thought, such as love, joy, &c.  (2) They are nothing to our present purpose, and cannot even be conceived unless the understanding be perceived previously. (3) When perception is removed, all these go with it.  [110] (1) False and fictitious ideas have nothing positive about them (as we have abundantly shown), which causes them to be called false or fictitious; they are only considered as such through the defectiveness of knowledge.  (2) Therefore, false and fictitious ideas as such can teach us nothing concerning the essence of thought; this must be sought from the positive properties just enumerated; in other words, we must lay down some common basis from which these properties necessarily follow, so that when this is given, the properties are necessarily given also, and when it is removed, they too vanish with it.  The rest of the treatise is wanting.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Spinoza's Endnotes: Marks as per Curley, see Note 5 above.  [a] (1) This might be explained more at large and more clearly:     I mean by distinguishing riches according as they are pursued for     their own sake, in or furtherance of fame, or sensual pleasure,     or the advancement of science and art. (2) But this subject is     reserved to its own place, for it is not here proper to     investigate the matter more accurately.  [b] These considerations should be set forth more precisely.  [c] These matters are explained more at length elsewhere.  [d] N.B. I do no more here than enumerate the sciences necessary     for our purpose; I lay no stress on their order.  [e] There is for the sciences but one end, to which they should     all be directed.  [f] (1) In this case we do not understand anything of the cause     from the consideration of it in the effect.  (2) This is     sufficiently evident from the fact that the cause is only     spoken of in very general terms, such as--there exists then     something; there exists then some power, &c.; or from the     that we only express it in a negative manner--it is not     or that, &c.  (3) In the second case something is ascribed     to the cause because of the effect, as we shall show in an     example, but only a property, never an essence.  [g] (1) From this example may be clearly seen what I have just     drawn attention to.  (2) For through this union we understand     nothing beyond the sensation, the effect, to wit, from which     we inferred the cause of which we understand nothing.  [h] (1) A conclusion of this sort, though it be certain, is yet     not to be relied on without great caution; for unless we are     exceedingly careful we shall forthwith fall into error.     (2) When things are conceived thus abstractedly, and not     through their true essence, they are apt to be confused by the     imagination.  (3) For that which is in itself one, men imagine     to be multiplex.  (4) To those things which are conceived     abstractedly, apart, and confusedly, terms are applied which are     apt to become wrested from their strict meaning, and bestowed on     things more familiar; whence it results that these latter are     imagined in the same way as the former to which the terms were     originally given.  [i] I shall here treat a little more in detail of experience,     and shall examine the method adopted by the Empirics,     and by recent philosophers.  [k] By native strength, I mean that not bestowed on us by external     causes, as I shall afterwards explain in my philosophy.  [l] Here I term them operations: I shall explain their nature     in my philosophy.  [m] I shall take care not only to demonstrate what I have just     advanced, but also that we have hitherto proceeded rightly,     and other things needful to be known.  [33note1] (1) In modern language, \"the idea may become the     subject of another presentation.\"  (2) Objectivus generally     corresponds to the modern \"subjective,\" formalis to the     modern \"objective.\" [Trans.- Note 1]  [n] (1) Observe that we are not here inquiring how the first     subjective essence is innate in us.  (2) This belongs to an     investigation into nature, where all these matters are amply     explained, and it is shown that without ideas neither     affirmation, nor negation, nor volition are possible.  [o] The nature of mental search is explained in my philosophy.  [p] To be connected with other things is to be produced by them,     or to produce them.  [q] In the same way as we have here no doubt of the truth of     our knowledge.  [r] See below the note on hypotheses, whereof we have a clear     understanding; the fiction consists in saying that such     hypotheses exist in heavenly bodies.  [s] (1) As a thing, when once it is understood, manifests itself,     we have need only of an example without further proof.     (2) In the same way the contrary has only to be presented to     our minds to be recognized as false, as will forthwith appear     when we come to discuss fiction concerning essences.  [t] Observe, that although many assert that they doubt whether God     exists, they have nought but his name in their minds, or else     some fiction which they call God: this fiction is not in     harmony with God's real nature, as we will duly show.  [u] (1) I shall presently show that no fiction can concern eternal     truths. By an eternal truth, I mean that which being positive     could never become negative.  (2) Thus it is a primary and     eternal truth that God exists, but it is not an eternal truth     that Adam thinks.  (3) That the Chimaera does not exist is an     eternal truth, that Adam does not think is not so.  [x] (1) Afterwards, when we come to speak of fiction that is     concerned with essences, it will be evident that fiction never     creates or furnishes the mind with anything new; only such things     as are already in the brain or imagination are recalled to the     memory, when the attention is directed to them confusedly and all     at once.  (2) For instance, we have remembrance of spoken words     and of a tree; when the mind directs itself to them confusedly,     it forms the notion of a tree speaking.  (3) The same may be said     of existence, especially when it is conceived quite generally as     an entity; it is then readily applied to all things together in     the memory.  (4) This is specially worthy of remark.  [y] We must understand as much in the case of hypotheses put forward     to explain certain movements accompanying celestial phenomena;     but from these, when applied to the celestial motions, we any     draw conclusions as to the nature of the heavens, whereas this     last may be quite"]]]
