Moreover, the States differed greatly in their material wealth and power. Nevertheless, all of them entered the convention as independent sovereign nations, and the smaller nations contended that the equality in suffrage and political power which prevailed in the convention (in which each State, large or small, voted as a unit), should and must be preserved in the future government. To this the larger States were quite unwilling to yield, and when the committee rose they reported, in substance, the Virginia plan, with the proviso that representation in the proposed double-chambered Congress should be \"according to some equitable ratio of representation.\"  On June 15 the small States presented their draft, which was afterwards known as the New Jersey plan, because it was introduced by Mr. Patterson of that State. It only contemplated an amendment to the existing Constitution and an amplification of the powers of the impotent Confederation. Its chief advance over the existing government was that it provided for a federal executive and a federal judiciary, but otherwise the government remained a mere league of States, in which the central government could generally act only by the vote of nine States, and in which their power was exhausted when they requested the States to enforce the decrees. Its chief advance over the Articles of Confederation, in addition to the creation of an executive, was an assertion that the acts of Congress \"shall be the supreme law of the respective States ... and that the judiciary of the several States shall be bound thereby in their decisions,\" and that \"if any State or any body of men in any State shall oppose or prevent the carrying into execution of such acts or treaties the federal executive shall be authorized to call forth the power of the confederated States ... to enforce and compel obedience to such acts or an observance of such treaties.\"  While this was some advance toward a truly national government, it yet left the national executive dependent upon the constituent States, for if they failed to respond to the call above stated the national government had no direct power over their citizens.  The New Jersey plan precipitated a crisis, and thereafter, and for many days, the argument proceeded, only to increase in bitterness.  On June 18 Alexander Hamilton, who agreed with no one else, addressed the convention for the first time. He spoke for five hours and reviewed exhaustively the Virginia and New Jersey plans, and possibly the Pinckney draft. Even the fragment of the speech, as taken in long-hand by Madison, shows that it was a masterly argument. He stated his belief \"that the British Government was the best in the world and that he doubted much whether anything short of it would do in America.\" He praised the British Constitution, quoting Monsieur Necker as saying that \"it was the only government in the world which unites government strength with individual security.\" He analysed and explained your Constitution as it then was and advocated an elective monarchy in form though not in name. It is true that he called the executive a \"governor\" and not a king, but the governor, so-called, was to serve for life and was given not only \"a negative on all laws about to be passed,\" but even the execution of all duly enacted laws was in his discretion. The governor, with the consent of the Senate, was to make war, conclude all treaties, make all appointments, pardon all offences, with the full power through his negative of saying what laws should be passed and which enforced. Hamilton's governor would have been not dissimilar to Louis XIV, and could have said with him, \"_L'Ã©tat, c'est moi_!\" The Senate also served for life, and the only concession which Hamilton made to democracy was an elective house of representatives. Thinly veiled, his plan contemplated an elective king with greater powers than those of George III, an imitation House of Lords and a popular House of Commons with a limited tenure.  Hamilton's plan was never taken seriously and, so far as the records show, was never afterwards considered. His admirers have given great praise to his work in the federal convention. His real contribution lay in the fact that when the Constitution was finally drafted and offered to the people, while he regarded it as a \"wretched makeshift,\" to use his own expression, yet he was broad and patriotic enough to surrender his own views and advocate the adoption of the Constitution. In so doing, he fought a valorous fight, secured the acquiescence of the State of New York, and without its ratification the Constitution would never have been adopted. Hamilton later thought better of the Constitution, and its successful beginning is due in large measure to his genius for constructive administration.  As the debate proceeded, the crisis precipitated by the seemingly insoluble differences between the great and little States became more acute. The smaller States contended that the convention was transgressing its powers, and they demanded that the credentials of the various members be read. In this there was technical accuracy, for the delegates had been appointed to revise the Articles of Confederation and not to adopt a new Constitution. A majority of the convention, however, insisted upon the convention proceeding with the consideration of a new Constitution, and their views prevailed. It speaks well for the honour of the delegates that although their differences became so acute as to lead at times to bitter expressions, neither side divulged them to the outside public. The smaller States could easily have ended the convention by an appeal to public opinion, which was not then prepared for a \"consolidated union,\" but they were loyal enough to fight out their quarrels within the walls of the convention hall.  At times the debate became bitter in the extreme. James Wilson, a delegate of Pennsylvania and a Scotchman by birth and education, turning to the representatives of the little States, passionately said:      \"Will you abandon a country to which you are bound by so many strong     and enduring ties? Should the event happen, it will neither stagger     my sentiments nor duty. If the minority of the people refuse to     coalesce with the majority on just and proper principles, if a     separation must take place, it could never happen on better     grounds.\"  He referred to the demand of the larger States that representation should be proportioned to the population. To this Bedford, of Delaware, as heatedly replied;      \"We have been told with a dictatorial air that this is the last     moment for a fair trial in favour of good government. It will be the     last, indeed, if the propositions reported by the committee go forth     to the people. The large States dare not dissolve the convention. If     they do, the small ones will find some foreign ally of more honour     and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice.\"  Finally, the smaller States gave their ultimatum to the larger States that unless representation in both branches of the proposed legislature should be on the basis of equality--each State, whether large or small, having one vote--they would forthwith leave the convention. An eye-witness says that, at that moment, Washington, who was in the chair, gave old Doctor Franklin a significant look. Franklin arose and moved an adjournment for forty-eight hours, with the understanding that the delegates should confer with those with whom they disagreed rather than with those with whom they agreed.  A recess was taken, and when the convention re-convened on July 2, a vote was taken as to equality of representation in the Senate and resulted in a tie vote. It was then decided to appoint a committee of eleven, one from each State, to consider the question, and this committee reported three days later, on July 5, in favour of proportionate representation in the House and equal representation in the Senate. This suggestion, which finally saved the situation, was due to that wise old utilitarian philosopher, Franklin. Again, a vehement and passionate debate followed. Vague references were made to the sword as the only method of solving the difference.  On July 9 the committee again reported, maintaining the principle of their recommendation, while modifying its details, and the debate then turned upon the question to what extent the negro slaves should count in estimating population for the purposes of proportionate representation in the lower House. Various suggestions were made to base representation upon wealth or taxation and not upon population. For several days the debate lasted during very heated weather, but on the night of July 12 the temperature dropped and with it the emotional temperature of the delegates.  Some days previous, namely, June 28, when the debates were becoming so bitter that it seemed unlikely that the convention could continue, Doctor Franklin, erroneously supposed by many to be an atheist, made the following solemn and beautiful appeal to their better natures. He said:      \"The small progress we have made after four or five weeks' close     attendance and continual reasonings with each other--our different     sentiments on almost every question, several of the last producing     as many noes as ayes, is, methinks, a melancholy proof of the     imperfection of the human understanding. We indeed seem to feel our     own want of political wisdom, since we have been running about in     search of it. We have gone back to ancient history for models of     government, and examined the different forms of those Republics     which, having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution,     now no longer exist. And we have viewed modern States all around     Europe, but find none of their constitutions suitable to our     circumstances.      \"In this situation of this Assembly, groping as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],["title","Gunman's Reckoning (#0)"],["body","GUNMAN'S RECKONING  By  Max Brand    1921    GUNMAN'S RECKONING    1   The fifty empty freights danced and rolled and rattled on the rough road bed and filled Jericho Pass with thunder; the big engine was laboring and grunting at the grade, but five cars back the noise of the locomotive was lost. Yet there is a way to talk above the noise of a freight train just as there is a way to whistle into the teeth of a stiff wind. This freight-car talk is pitched just above the ordinary tone--it is an overtone of conversation, one might say--and it is distinctly nasal. The brakie could talk above the racket, and so, of course, could Lefty Joe. They sat about in the center of the train, on the forward end of one of the cars. No matter how the train lurched and staggered over that fearful road bed, these two swayed in their places as easily and as safely as birds on swinging perches. The brakie had touched Lefty Joe for two dollars; he had secured fifty cents; and since the vigor of Lefty's oaths had convinced him that this was all the money the tramp had, the two now sat elbow to elbow and killed the distance with their talk.  \"It's like old times to have you here,\" said the brakie. \"You used to play this line when you jumped from coast to coast.\"  \"Sure,\" said Lefty Joe, and he scowled at the mountains on either side of the pass. The train was gathering speed, and the peaks lurched eastward in a confused, ragged procession. \"And a durned hard ride it's been many a time.\"  \"Kind of queer to see you,\" continued the brakie. \"Heard you was rising in the world.\"  He caught the face of the other with a rapid side glance, but Lefty Joe was sufficiently concealed by the dark.  \"Heard you were the main guy with a whole crowd behind you,\" went on the brakie.  \"Yeh?\"  \"Sure. Heard you was riding the cushions, and all that.\"  \"Yeh?\"  \"But I guess it was all bunk; here you are back again, anyway.\"  \"Yep,\" agreed Lefty.  The brakie scratched his head, for the silence of the tramp convinced him that there had been, after all, a good deal of truth in the rumor. He ran back on another tack and slipped about Lefty.  \"I never laid much on what they said,\" he averred. \"I know you, Lefty; you can do a lot, but when it comes to leading a whole gang, like they said you was, and all that--well, I knew it was a lie. Used to tell 'em that.\"  \"You talked foolish, then,\" burst out Lefty suddenly. \"It was all straight.\"  The brakie could hear the click of his companion's teeth at the period to this statement, as though he regretted his outburst.  \"Well, I'll be hanged,\" murmured the brakie innocently.  Ordinarily, Lefty was not easily lured, but this night he apparently was in the mood for talk.  \"Kennebec Lou, the Clipper, and Suds. Them and a lot more. They was all with me; they was all under me; I was the Main Guy!\"  What a ring in his voice as he said it! The beaten general speaks thus of his past triumphs. The old man remembered his youth in such a voice. The brakie was impressed; he repeated the three names.  \"Even Suds?\" he said. \"Was even Suds with you?\"  \"Even Suds!\"  The brakie stirred a little, wabbling from side to side as he found a more comfortable position; instead of looking straight before him, he kept a side-glance steadily upon his companion, and one could see that he intended to remember what was said on this night.  \"Even Suds,\" echoed the brakie. \"Good heavens, and ain't he a man for you?\"  \"He was a man,\" replied Lefty Joe with an indescribable emphasis.  \"Huh?\"  \"He ain't a man any more.\"  \"Get bumped off?\"  \"No. Busted.\"  The brakie considered this bit of news and rolled it back and forth and tried its flavor against his gossiping palate.  \"Did you fix him after he left you?\"  \"No.\"  \"I see. You busted him while he was still with you. Then Kennebec Lou and the Clipper get sore at the way you treat Suds. So here you are back on the road with your gang all gone bust. Hard luck, Lefty.\"  But Lefty whined with rage at this careless diagnosis of his downfall.  \"You're all wrong,\" he said. \"You're all wrong. You don't know nothin'.\"  The brakie waited, grinning securely into the night, and preparing his mind for the story. But the story consisted of one word, flung bitterly into the rushing air.  \"Donnegan!\"  \"Him?\" cried the brakie, starting in his place.  \"Donnegan!\" cried Lefty, and his voice made the word into a curse.  The brakie nodded.  \"Them that get tangled with Donnegan don't last long. You ought to know that.\"  At this the grief, hate, and rage in Lefty Joe were blended and caused an explosion.  \"Confound Donnegan. Who's Donnegan? I ask you, who's Donnegan?\"  \"A guy that makes trouble,\" replied the brakie, evidently hard put to it to find a definition.  \"Oh, don't he make it, though? Confound him!\"  \"You ought to of stayed shut of him, Lefty.\"  \"Did I hunt him up, I ask you? Am I a nut? No, I ain't. Do I go along stepping on the tail of a rattlesnake? No more do I look up Donnegan.\"  He groaned as he remembered.  \"I was going fine. Nothing could of been better. I had the boys together. We was doing so well that I was riding the cushions and I went around planning the jobs. Nice, clean work. No cans tied to it. But one day I had to meet Suds down in the Meriton Jungle. You know?\"  \"I've heard--plenty,\" said the brakie.  \"Oh, it ain't so bad--the Meriton. I've seen a lot worse. Found Suds there, and Suds was playing Black Jack with an ol gink. He was trimmin' him close. Get Suds going good and he could read 'em three down and bury 'em as fast as they came under the bottom card. Takes a hand to do that sort of work. And that's the sort of work Suds was doing for the old man. Pretty soon the game was over and the old man was busted. He took up his pack and beat it, saying nothing and looking sick. I started talking to Suds.  \"And while he was talking, along comes a bo and gives us a once-over. He knew me. 'Is this here a friend of yours, Lefty? he says.  \"'Sure,' says I.  \"'Then, he's in Dutch. He trimmed that old dad, and the dad is one of Donnegan's pals. Wait till Donnegan hears how your friend made the cards talk while he was skinning the old boy!  \"He passes me the wink and goes on. Made me sick. I turned to Suds, and the fool hadn't batted an eye. Never even heard of Donnegan. You know how it is? Half the road never heard of it; part of the roads don't know nothin' else. He's like a jumpin tornado; hits every ten miles and don't bend a blade of grass in between.  \"Took me about five minutes to tell Suds about Donnegan. Then Suds let out a grunt and started down the trail for the old dad. Missed him. Dad had got out of the Jungle and copped a rattler. Suds come back half green and half yeller.  \"'I've done it; I've spilled the beans,' he says.  \"'That ain't half sayin' it,' says I.  \"Well, we lit out after that and beat it down the line as fast as we could. We got the rest of the boys together; I had a swell job planned up. Everything staked. Then, the first news come that Donnegan was after Suds.  \"News just dropped on us out of the sky. Suds, you know how he is. Strong bluff. Didn't bat an eye. Laughed at this Donnegan. Got a hold of an old pal of his, named Levine, and he is a mighty hot scrapper. From a knife to a toenail, they was nothing that Levine couldn't use in a fight. Suds sent him out to cross Donnegan's trail.  \"He crossed it, well enough. Suds got a telegram a couple days later saying that Levine had run into a wild cat and was considerable chawed and would Suds send him a stake to pay the doctor?  \"Well, after that Suds got sort of nervous. Didn't take no interest in his work no more. Kept a weather eye out watching for the coming of Donnegan. And pretty soon he up and cleaned out of camp.  \"Next day, sure enough, along comes Donnegan and asks for Suds. We kept still--all but Kennebec Lou. Kennebec is some fighter himself. Two hundred pounds of mule muscle with the brain of a devil to tell what to do--yes, you can lay it ten to one that Kennebec is some fighter. That day he had a good edge from a bottle of rye he was trying for a friend.  \"He didn't need to go far to find trouble in Donnegan. A wink and a grin was all they needed for a password, and then they went at each other's throats. Kennebec made the first pass and hit thin air; and before he got back on his heels, Donnegan had hit him four times. Then Kennebec jumped back and took a fresh start with a knife.\"  Here Lefty Joe paused and sighed.  He continued, after a long interval: \"Five minutes later we was all busy tyin' up what was left of Kennebec; Donnegan was down the road whistlin' like a bird. And that was the end of my gang. What with Kennebec Lou and Suds both gone, what chance did I have to hold the boys together?\"     2   The brakie heard this recital with the keenest interest, nodding from time to time.  \"What beats me, Lefty,\" he said at the end of the story, \"is why you didn't knife into the fight yourself and take a hand with Donnegan\"  At this Lefty was silent. It was rather the silence of one which cannot tell whether or not it is worth while to speak than it was the silence of one who needs time for thought.  \"I'll tell you why, bo. It's because when I take a trail like that it only has one end I'm going to bump off the other bird or he's going to bump off me\"  The brakie cleared his throat  \"Look here,\" he said, \"looks to me like a queer thing that you're on this train\"  \"Does it\" queried Lefty softly \"Why?\"  \"Because Donnegan is two cars back, asleep.\"  \"The devil you say!\"  The brakie broke into laughter  \"Don't kid yourself along,\" he warned. \"Don't do it. It ain't wise--with me.\"  \"What you mean?\"  \"Come on, Lefty. Come clean. You better do a fade off this train.\"  \"Why, you fool--\"  \"It don't work, Joe. Why, the minute I seen you I knew why you was here. I knew you meant to croak Donnegan.\"  \"Me croak him? Why should I croak him?\"  \"Because you been trailing him two thousand miles. Because you ain't got the nerve to"]]]
