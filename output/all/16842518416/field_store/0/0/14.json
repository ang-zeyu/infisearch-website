Their cemetery have upon this side     With Epicurus all his followers,     Who with the body mortal make the soul;  But in the question thou dost put to me,     Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,     And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”  And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed     From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,     Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”  “O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire     Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,     Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.  Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest     A native of that noble fatherland,     To which perhaps I too molestful was.”  Upon a sudden issued forth this sound     From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,     Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.  And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?     Behold there Farinata who has risen;     From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”  I had already fixed mine eyes on his,     And he uprose erect with breast and front     E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.  And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader     Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,     Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”  As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb     Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,     Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”  I, who desirous of obeying was,     Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;     Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.  Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been     To me, and to my fathers, and my party;     So that two several times I scattered them.”  “If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”     I answered him, “the first time and the second;     But yours have not acquired that art aright.”  Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered     Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;     I think that he had risen on his knees.  Round me he gazed, as if solicitude     He had to see if some one else were with me,     But after his suspicion was all spent,  Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind     Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,     Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”  And I to him: “I come not of myself;     He who is waiting yonder leads me here,     Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”  His language and the mode of punishment     Already unto me had read his name;     On that account my answer was so full.  Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How     Saidst thou,—he had?  Is he not still alive?     Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”  When he became aware of some delay,     Which I before my answer made, supine     He fell again, and forth appeared no more.  But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire     I had remained, did not his aspect change,     Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.  “And if,” continuing his first discourse,     “They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,     That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.  But fifty times shall not rekindled be     The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,     Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;  And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,     Say why that people is so pitiless     Against my race in each one of its laws?”  Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage     Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause     Such orisons in our temple to be made.”  After his head he with a sigh had shaken,     “There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely     Without a cause had with the others moved.  But there I was alone, where every one     Consented to the laying waste of Florence,     He who defended her with open face.”  “Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”     I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,     Which has entangled my conceptions here.  It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,     Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,     And in the present have another mode.”  “We see, like those who have imperfect sight,     The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;     So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.  When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain     Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,     Not anything know we of your human state.  Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead     Will be our knowledge from the moment when     The portal of the future shall be closed.”  Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,     Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,     That still his son is with the living joined.  And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,     Tell him I did it because I was thinking     Already of the error you have solved me.”  And now my Master was recalling me,     Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit     That he would tell me who was with him there.  He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;     Within here is the second Frederick,     And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”  Thereon he hid himself; and I towards     The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting     Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.  He moved along; and afterward thus going,     He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”     And I in his inquiry satisfied him.  “Let memory preserve what thou hast heard     Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,     “And now attend here;” and he raised his finger.  “When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet     Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,     From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”  Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;     We left the wall, and went towards the middle,     Along a path that strikes into a valley,  Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.     Inferno: Canto XI   Upon the margin of a lofty bank     Which great rocks broken in a circle made,     We came upon a still more cruel throng;  And there, by reason of the horrible     Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,     We drew ourselves aside behind the cover  Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,     Which said: “Pope Anastasius I hold,     Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”  “Slow it behoveth our descent to be,     So that the sense be first a little used     To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.”  The Master thus; and unto him I said,     “Some compensation find, that the time pass not     Idly;” and he: “Thou seest I think of that.  My son, upon the inside of these rocks,”     Began he then to say, “are three small circles,     From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.  They all are full of spirits maledict;     But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,     Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.  Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,     Injury is the end; and all such end     Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.  But because fraud is man’s peculiar vice,     More it displeases God; and so stand lowest     The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.  All the first circle of the Violent is;     But since force may be used against three persons,     In three rounds ’tis divided and constructed.  To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we     Use force; I say on them and on their things,     As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.  A death by violence, and painful wounds,     Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance     Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;  Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,     Marauders, and freebooters, the first round     Tormenteth all in companies diverse.  Man may lay violent hands upon himself     And his own goods; and therefore in the second     Round must perforce without avail repent  Whoever of your world deprives himself,     Who games, and dissipates his property,     And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.  Violence can be done the Deity,     In heart denying and blaspheming Him,     And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.  And for this reason doth the smallest round     Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,     And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.  Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,     A man may practise upon him who trusts,     And him who doth no confidence imburse.  This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers     Only the bond of love which Nature makes;     Wherefore within the second circle nestle  Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,     Falsification, theft, and simony,     Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.  By the other mode, forgotten is that love     Which Nature makes, and what is after added,     From which there is a special faith engendered.  Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is     Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,     Whoe’er betrays for ever is consumed.”  And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds     Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes     This cavern and the people who possess it.  But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,     Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,     And who encounter with such bitter tongues,  Wherefore are they inside of the red city     Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,     And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”  And unto me he said: “Why wanders so     Thine intellect from that which it is wont?     Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?  Hast thou no recollection of those words     With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses     The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—  Incontinence, and Malice, and insane     Bestiality? and how Incontinence     Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?  If thou regardest this conclusion well,     And to thy mind recallest who they are     That up outside are undergoing penance,  Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons     They separated are, and why less wroth     Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.”  “O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,     Thou"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1001"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Hell (#7)"],["body","content me so, when thou resolvest,     That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!  Once more a little backward turn thee,” said I,     “There where thou sayest that usury offends     Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”  “Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,     Noteth, not only in one place alone,     After what manner Nature takes her course  From Intellect Divine, and from its art;     And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,     After not many pages shalt thou find,  That this your art as far as possible     Follows, as the disciple doth the master;     So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.  From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind     Genesis at the beginning, it behoves     Mankind to gain their life and to advance;  And since the usurer takes another way,     Nature herself and in her follower     Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.  But follow, now, as I would fain go on,     For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,     And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,  And far beyond there we descend the crag.”     Inferno: Canto XII   The place where to descend the bank we came     Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,     Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.  Such as that ruin is which in the flank     Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,     Either by earthquake or by failing stay,  For from the mountain’s top, from which it moved,     Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,     Some path ’twould give to him who was above;  Even such was the descent of that ravine,     And on the border of the broken chasm     The infamy of Crete was stretched along,  Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;     And when he us beheld, he bit himself,     Even as one whom anger racks within.  My Sage towards him shouted: “Peradventure     Thou think’st that here may be the Duke of Athens,     Who in the world above brought death to thee?  Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not     Instructed by thy sister, but he comes     In order to behold your punishments.”  As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment     In which he has received the mortal blow,     Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,  The Minotaur beheld I do the like;     And he, the wary, cried: “Run to the passage;     While he wroth, ’tis well thou shouldst descend.”  Thus down we took our way o’er that discharge     Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves     Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.  Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking     Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded     By that brute anger which just now I quenched.  Now will I have thee know, the other time     I here descended to the nether Hell,     This precipice had not yet fallen down.  But truly, if I well discern, a little     Before His coming who the mighty spoil     Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,  Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley     Trembled so, that I thought the Universe     Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think  The world ofttimes converted into chaos;     And at that moment this primeval crag     Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.  But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near     The river of blood, within which boiling is     Whoe’er by violence doth injure others.”  O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,     That spurs us onward so in our short life,     And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!  I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,     As one which all the plain encompasses,     Conformable to what my Guide had said.  And between this and the embankment’s foot     Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,     As in the world they used the chase to follow.  Beholding us descend, each one stood still,     And from the squadron three detached themselves,     With bows and arrows in advance selected;  And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment     Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?     Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”  My Master said: “Our answer will we make     To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,     That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”  Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,     Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,     And for himself, himself did vengeance take.  And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,     Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;     That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.  Thousands and thousands go about the moat     Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges     Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”  Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;     Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch     Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.  After he had uncovered his great mouth,     He said to his companions: “Are you ware     That he behind moveth whate’er he touches?  Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”     And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,     Where the two natures are together joined,  Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone     Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;     Necessity, and not delight, impels us.  Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,     Who unto me committed this new office;     No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.  But by that virtue through which I am moving     My steps along this savage thoroughfare,     Give us some one of thine, to be with us,  And who may show us where to pass the ford,     And who may carry this one on his back;     For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”  Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,     And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,     And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”  We with our faithful escort onward moved     Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,     Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.  People I saw within up to the eyebrows,     And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,     Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.  Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here     Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius     Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.  That forehead there which has the hair so black     Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,     Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,  Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”     Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,     “Now he be first to thee, and second I.”  A little farther on the Centaur stopped     Above a folk, who far down as the throat     Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.  A shade he showed us on one side alone,     Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom     The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.”  Then people saw I, who from out the river     Lifted their heads and also all the chest;     And many among these I recognised.  Thus ever more and more grew shallower     That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;     And there across the moat our passage was.  “Even as thou here upon this side beholdest     The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”     The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe  That on this other more and more declines     Its bed, until it reunites itself     Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.  Justice divine, upon this side, is goading     That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,     And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks  The tears which with the boiling it unseals     In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,     Who made upon the highways so much war.”  Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.     Inferno: Canto XIII   Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,     When we had put ourselves within a wood,     That was not marked by any path whatever.  Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,     Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,     Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.  Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,     Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold     ’Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.  There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,     Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,     With sad announcement of impending doom;  Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,     And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;     They make laments upon the wondrous trees.  And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,     Know that thou art within the second round,”     Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till  Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;     Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see     Things that will credence give unto my speech.”  I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,     And person none beheld I who might make them,     Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.  I think he thought that I perhaps might think     So many voices issued through those trunks     From people who concealed themselves from us;  Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off     Some little spray from any of these trees,     The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”  Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,     And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;     And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”  After it had become embrowned with blood,     It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?     Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?  Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;     Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,     Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”  As out of a green brand, that is on fire     At one of the ends, and from the other drips     And hisses with the wind that is escaping;  So from that splinter issued forth together     Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip     Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.  “Had he been able sooner to believe,”     My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,     What only in my verses he has seen,  Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;     Whereas the thing incredible has caused me     To put him to an act which grieveth me.  But tell him who thou wast, so that by way     Of some amends thy fame he may"]]]
