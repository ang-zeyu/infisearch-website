TELLS ABOUT HOW CAMP McCORD DIDN'T STRIKE ITS COLORS      CHAPTER I  TELLS YOU HOW WE GOT STARTED  Maybe you fellows will remember about how I was telling you that our troop had a house-boat that was loaned to us for the summer, by a man that lives out our way. He said we could fix it up and use it to go to Temple Camp in. It was a peach of a boat and took the hills fine-- that's what we said just to jolly Pee-wee Harris, who is in our troop. He's awfully easy to jolly, but he doesn't stay mad long, that's one good thing about him.  But one trouble, that boat didn't have any power, and it wouldn't even drift right on account of being almost square. Westy Martin said it was on the square, all right. He's a crazy kid, that fellow is. Anyway, the boat didn't have any power. Our scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth, said it didn't even have any will power. We couldn't even pole it.  When we first got it, it was way up a creek in the marshes and Mr. Donnelle (he's the man that owned it) took us there and showed it to us. Just as we were coming near it, a fellow jumped out of it and ran away through the marshes. We said he must be a tramp, because he was all ragged. Anyway, he acted as if he was scared, that was one sure thing.  \"We should worry about him, anyway,\" I said; and Mr. Donnelle said he was gone and that was the end of him.  But, believe me, that wasn't the end of him. That was only the beginning of him. I didn't say anything more about him before, because I didn't know, but believe me, that fellow was--what do you call it-- you know--_destined_--to cause a lot of trouble in our young lives. That sounds like a regular author, hey? _Destined_.  When we began fixing the boat up, we found that one of the lockers was locked with a padlock and as long as the boat didn't belong to us, we didn't break it open, especially because there were plenty of lockers besides that one. I bet you'd like to know what was in that locker. But you're not going to find that out yet, so there's no use asking. All the time we thought Mr. Donnelle had the key to it. But, oh, just you wait.  Well, after we got it all fixed up, we couldn't decide how we'd get it down into the bay and then up the Hudson to Catskill Landing. That's where you have to go to get to Temple Camp. Temple Camp is a great big scout camp and it's right on the shore of Black Lake--oh, it's peachy. You'll see it, all right, and you'll see Jeb Rushmore--he's camp manager. He used to be a trapper out west. You'll see us all around camp-fire--you wait. Mr. Ellsworth says this story is all right so far, only to go on about the boat. Gee, I'll go faster than the boat did, that's one sure thing, leave it to me. But after we got down into the Hudson we went fast, all right. Let's see where was I?  Oh, yes, we were wondering how we'd get to camp in it because we didn't have much money in our troop, on account of being broke. Poor, but honest, hey? And it costs a lot of money to be towed and an engine would cost a hundred and fifty dollars. Nix on the engine, you can bet. But, oh, boy, there's one thing Mr. Ellsworth said and it's true, I've got to admit that. He said that good turns are good investments--he says they pay a hundred percent. That's even better than Liberty Bonds. You don't get it back in money, but you get it back in fun--what's the difference?  Well, we did a good turn, and oh, believe me, there was _some_ come back!  One day a tug came up our river on its way up to North Bridgeboro. That's where the mill is. And there wasn't anybody there to open the bridge so it could get through. Oh, wasn't that old tug captain mad! He kept whistling and whistling and saying things about the river being an old mud hole, and how he'd never get down the bay again, unless he could get through and come down on the full tide. Oh, boy, but he was wild.  When we told him that old Uncle Jimmy, the bridge tender, had sneaked away to a Grand Army Convention, he kind of cooled down on account of being an old veteran himself, and then some of us fellows fished up an old key-bar that had been lost in the river and opened the bridge with it. That's what they call the thing you open the bridge with--a key-bar. It's like a crow-bar only different.  I'm not saying that was so much of a good turn, except it was turning the bridge around and Connie Bennett said that was a good turn. He's the troop cut-up. Anyway, old Captain Savage took me up to North Bridgeboro with him and first I was kind of scared of him, because he had a big red face and he was awful gruff. But wait till you hear about the fun we had with him when we landed and took a peek at Peekskill. Oh, boy!  Then he said how he liked the way we stood up for Uncle Jimmy, and I guess besides he was glad about me diving and getting the key-bar, but anyway, that was easy. So he said he was going to tow us up as far as Poughkeepsie the next Saturday, and that if we refused on account of scouts not being willing to accept anything for a service, he'd make a lot of trouble for Uncle Jimmy, because he was away. He was only fooling when he said that. Maybe you won't like him in the beginning, but you'll get to like him pretty soon.  So that's how we got it all fixed to go to camp, or part of the way anyway, in the house-boat. And believe me, we had some trip, and that's mostly what I'm going to tell you all about. Talk about fun!  On Saturday morning all of the troop came down to the house-boat ready for the trip, and oh, you ought to have seen Skinny McCord. He's a little fellow that lives down in the poor part of town, and he was a new member. His mother is poor and she goes out washing, and Skinny was sick and his clothes were all in rags, and even he didn't have any shoes and stockings. But, anyway, he did me a good turn and so Westy Martin and I got him into the troop, and we presented him to the Elk Patrol, because they had a vacant place on account of Tom Slade being away in France. So now you know about Skinny and you'll find out a lot more about him, too.  Before Saturday came, Mr. Ellsworth made a bargain with Sandy Grober to tow us down into the Kill Von Kull--that's near Staten Island, you know. Sandy has a boat with a heavy duty motor in it, and he said he'd do the job for ten dollars, because, anyway, he'd go to Princess Bay fishing. Our troop was broke and we couldn't spare the money, because we needed all we had for eats and things. So this is the way we fixed it.  Mr. Ellsworth gave Sandy the ten dollars and then each one of the patrol leaders gave Mr. Ellsworth a note saying his patrol would pay back two dollars and a half as soon as they earned it. That would make seven dollars and a half, and Mr. Ellsworth said he would pay the other two fifty himself, so you see it was all divided up even between the patrols and the scoutmaster.  Believe me, we had some fun earning that money, especially the Raving Ravens--that's the Raven Patrol, you know.  We started early Saturday morning, and we knew just where we had to go, because we had a letter from Captain Savage, saying that we should wait in the anchorage off St. George at Staten Island, until he came and got us. He said maybe it would be Sunday night or maybe Monday morning, but anyway, just to ride on our anchor till he came.  We didn't have any adventures going down our river and I won't bother telling you about it, because it would only be slow. Gee, williger, a story that's being towed against the tide wouldn't have much action, would it? I bet you'd skip. So it's better for _me_ to skip than for _you_, hey?  But anyway, on the way down we got the boat all straightened out inside and decided just how we'd sleep. Two patrols would sleep in the two rooms and one patrol on deck under the awning, and we decided we'd take turns that way, so each patrol would get some sleeping outdoors.  We didn't get to the Kill Von Kull till about five o'clock and I guess it was about six o'clock when we got to St. George. Oh, but there are some peachy boats in the anchorage there--regular yachts "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10316"],["title","Roy Blakeley's Adventures in Camp (#1)"],["body","big cabin cruisers. And that's where our adventures began, you can bet. Do you like mysteries? Gee, that's one thing I'm crazy about--mysteries-- mysteries and pineapple sodas. Oh, Oh!  Then Sandy left us and went off to catch cash-on-delivery fish--that's COD fish. Oh, boy, but it was fine rocking away out there. Pretty soon I got supper because I'm cook. I know how to make flapjacks and hunters' stew, and a lot of things. After supper the fellows decided to go ashore to St. George and get some sodas and take in a movie show. I said I'd stay on the houseboat because I had to write up the troop-book. Maybe I forgot to tell you that I'm troop historian. Most of the things in this story are out of our troop book.  You'd better not skip the next chapter, because something is going to happen.    CHAPTER II  TELLS YOU HOW I HAD A VISITOR  We weren't anchored very far from shore, so it didn't take long for all the troop to row over, even though we only had one small boat. Mr. Ellsworth went with them so he could look after Skinny.  As soon as I had finished clearing up after supper, I got out the troop book and began writing it up. I was behind about two weeks with it and so I had about ten pages to do. Oh, but it was dandy sitting there on the deck with my feet up on the railing, writing. I mean I was writing with my hand. Pretty soon it began getting dark and I could see the lights coming out on all the different boats just like stars. It's kind of fun being alone sometimes. I could see all the lights in the town, too, but what did I care? I said I'd rather be alone where I was. Pretty soon it was too dark to write and so I just sat there thinking. Maybe you think it's no fun just thinking. But I was thinking how pretty soon we'd be hiking up from Catskill Landing to Black Lake, and how I'd see Jeb Rushmore, and how I'd take a hike and find out if the robin's nest was just where it was last year. That robin is a member of our patrol--he's an honorary member.  All of a sudden I saw it was pitch dark and I couldn't see any boats at all, only lights, moving a little on account of the boats rocking.  In a little while I heard oars splashing and the sound seemed to be coming nearer and nearer, so I knew it was the first boat-load of fellows coming back. I thought it was awful soon for them to be getting back. It seemed funny that they weren't talking, especially if it was the Raving Ravens (that's what we call the Raven Patrol) because Pee-wee Harris would be sure to be running on high. That's the way he always does, especially coming home from the movies. And if it was the Elk Patrol I'd be sure to hear Bert McAlpin because he's a human victrola record.  Pretty soon I could make out a black spot coming nearer and then I knew for sure it was headed for the house-boat. But there wasn't any sound except the splashing of the oars and I thought that was mighty funny. In a couple of minutes the boat came alongside and I heard someone say, \"_Pst_\" very quiet like. I went and looked over the rail and there I saw a fellow all alone in a rowboat. I couldn't see him very well, but I could see he had on an old hat and was pretty shabby.  Then he sort of whispered, \"Anybody up there, Skeezeks?\"  I told him no, and asked him who he was and what he wanted, but he didn't say anything, only tied his boat, and climbed up over the rail. Then I could see him better by the light shining through the cabin window, and his clothes were all ragged and greasy. He looked pretty tough, but one thing, anyway, he smiled an awful nice kind of a smile and hit me a whack on the shoulder and said: \"Don't get excited, Skeezeks; you're all right and I won't hurt you. How are you, anyway?\"  I told him I was very well, but I'd like for him please to tell me who he was, so I'd know.  Then he gave me another push, and I don't know, there was something about him that kind of made me like him, and I wasn't scared of him at all.  \"Don't you know who I am?\" he said.  \"I kind of think maybe you're the fellow that jumped out of this boat and ran away, when it was up the creek near Little Valley. You look kind of like him.\"  \"Right the first time,\" he said, \"and I bet you're a bully little scout. What do you say?\" Then he looked out over the water to be sure nobody was coming.  \"I'm a first class scout, and I've got nine merit badges, and I'm a patrol leader,\" I told him. \"Anyway I'd like to know what you want here.\"  \"_Patrol leader! No!_\" he said, and I could see he was only trying to get on the right side of me, and that he didn't know what a patrol leader is at all.  \"Can patrol leaders keep secrets?\" he said.  I told him if it was a good secret, they could. Then he hit me a good whack on the shoulder and he winked at me awful funny and said:      They are fools who go and tell       Wisely has the poet sung.     Man may hold all sorts of jobs       If he'll only hold his tongue.  \"Are you a tramp?\" I asked him.  \"_A tramp!_\" he said, \"that's pretty good. I dare say I look like one.\"  Then he jumped up on the railing and began laughing so hard I was afraid he'd fall backwards into the water. I told him he'd better look out, but he only laughed more, and said I was a great kid. Then all of a sudden he happened to think and he looked around to see if anyone was coming. Then he said,  \"Are you game to help me in a dark plot?\"  Gee, I didn't know what to tell him. \"It depends upon how dark it is,\" I said. Because, jiminy, I wanted to be careful and watch my step. But that only made him laugh a lot. Then he said,  \"Well, it isn't exactly a black plot, but it's a kind of a dark brown.\"  \"One thing sure,\" I said, \"you're not a tramp, I know that--I can tell.\"  \"You're a wise little gazabo,\" he said. \"Would you really like to know who I am?\"  I told him sure I would.  \"Do you think I look like a tramp?\" he asked me.  \"I think you kind of look like one,\" I said; \"but you don't act like one, and you don't laugh like one.\"  \"I've got blamed little reason to laugh,\" he said, \"because I'm in Dutch, and you've got to do me a good turn. Will you?\"  \"Good turns are our middle names,\" I told him, \"but anyway, I'd like to know who you are--that's sure.\"  Then he said, \"I'm Lieutenant Donnelle, Mr. Donnelle's son. And I guess I had a right to run away from the boat, didn't I?\"  \"G-o-o-d night!\" I said.    CHAPTER III  TELLS HOW I MADE A PROMISE  Then he said, \"Were you one of the kids who were coming along with my father when I jumped out of the boat?\" And I told him yes. Then he said, \"You don't think he saw me, do you?\" I said, \"Yes, he saw you, but I guess he didn't know who you were, he didn't see your face, that's sure.\"  \"Thank goodness for that,\" he said, \"because I've caused the old gent a lot of trouble.\"  \"Anyway,\" I told him, \"I don't see why you don't wear your uniform. Gee, if I had a lieutenant's uniform you bet I'd wear it.\"  \"Would you?\" he said, and he began to laugh. Then he said, \"Well, now, let's sit down here on this bench and I'll tell you what _you're_ going to do, and then I'll tell you what _I'm_ going to do, and we'll have to be quick about it.\" Then he looked out over the water and listened and as soon as he was sure nobody was coming, he put his arm over my shoulder and made me sit down on the bench beside him. I have to admit I kind of liked that fellow, even though I kind of thought he was, you know, wild, sort of. It seemed as if he was the kind of a fellow to have a lot of adventures and to be reckless and all that.  \"Maybe you can tell me what you're going to do,\" I told him, \"but you can't tell me what _I'm_ going to do--that's one sure thing.\"  \"Oh, yes I can,\" he said, \"because you're a bully kid and you're an A-1 sport, and you and I are going to be pals. What do you say?\"  \"I can't deny that I like you,\" I said, \"and I bet you've been to a lot of places.\"  \"France, Russia, South America, Panama and Montclair, New Jersey,\" he said, \"and Bronx Park.\" Gee, I didn't know how to take him, he was so funny.  \"Ever been up in an airplane?\" he said.  \"Cracky, I'd like to,\" I told him.  \"I went from Paris to the Channel in an airplane,\" he said.  Then he gave me a crack on the back and he put his arm around my shoulder awful nice and friendly like, and it made me kind of proud because I knew him.  \"Now, you listen here,\" he said, \"I'm in a dickens of a fix. You live in Bridgeboro; do you know Jake Holden?\"  \"Sure I know him, he's a fisherman,\" I said; \"the very same night your father told us we could use this boat I saw him, and the next day I went to try to find him for a certain reason, and he was gone away down the bay after fish. He taught me how to fry eels.\"  \"Get out,\" he said, \"really?\"  \"Honest, he did,\" I told him.  \"Well, some day I'll show you how to cook bear's meat. There's something you don't know.\"  \"Did you ever cook bear's meat?\" I asked him.  \"Surest thing you know,\" he said; \"black bears, gray bears, grisly bears--\"  \"Jiminy,\" I said.  Then he went on and this is what he told me, keeping his arm around my shoulder and every minute or so listening and looking out over the water. \"Here's something you didn't know,\" he said. Gee, I can remember every word almost, because you bet I listened. A fellow couldn't help listening to him. He said, \"When Jake Holden went down the bay, your Uncle Dudley was with him.\"  I said, \"You mean you?\"  \"I mean _me_,\" he said. \"I was home from Camp Dix on a short leave and was on my way to see the old gent and the rest of the folks, when who should I run plunk into but that old water rat. It was five o'clock in the morning, and I was just taking a hop, skip and a jump off the train. 'Come on down the bay fishing,' he says. 'What, in these togs?' I told him. 'I'll get 'em all greased up and what'll Uncle Sam say?' 'Go home and get some old ones,' he said. ''Gainst the rules,' I said, 'can't be running around in civilized clothes.' 'You should worry about civilized clothes,' he said. 'Go up to your"]]]
