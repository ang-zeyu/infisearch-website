It is entirely paid for, and contributions for its erection came from every state in the Union, and from many lands. The auditorium is said to seat between fourteen and fifteen hundred, and was thronged at the four services on the day of dedication. The sermon prepared by Mrs. Eddy was read by Mrs. Bemis. It rehearsed the significance of the building, and reënunciated the truths which will find emphasis there. From the description we judge that it is one of the most beautiful buildings in Boston, and, indeed, in all New England. Whatever may be thought of the peculiar tenets of the Christian Scientists, and whatever difference of opinion there may be concerning the organization of such a church, there can be no question but that the adherents of this church have proved their faith by their works.     (_American Art Journal_, New York, January 26, 1895.)  \"OUR PRAYER IN STONE.\"   Such is the excellent name given to a new Boston church. Few people outside its own circles, realize how extensive is the belief in Christian Science. There are several sects of mental healers, but this new edifice on Back Bay, just off Huntington avenue, not far from the big Mechanics building and the proposed site of the new Music hall, belongs to the followers of Rev. Mary Baker Glover Eddy, a lady born of an old New Hampshire family, who, after many vicissitudes, found herself in Lynn, Mass., healed by the power of Divine Mind, and thereupon devoted herself to imparting this faith to her fellow beings. Coming to Boston about 1880 she began teaching, gathered an association of students, and organized a church. For several years past she has lived in Concord, N.H., near her birthplace, owning a beautiful estate called Pleasant View; but thousands of believers throughout this country have joined the Mother Church in Boston and have now erected this edifice at a cost of over two hundred thousand dollars, every bill being paid.  Its appearance is shown in the pictures we are permitted to publish. In the belfry is a set of tubular chimes. Inside is a basement room, capable of division into seven excellent class rooms, by the use of movable partitions. The main auditorium has wide galleries, and will seat over a thousand in its exceedingly comfortable pews. Scarcely any woodwork is to be found. The floors are all mosaic, the steps marble, and the walls stone. It is rather dark, often too much so for comfortable reading, as all the windows are of colored glass, with pictures symbolic of the tenets of the organization. In the ceiling is a beautiful sunburst window. Adjoining the chancel is a pastor's study; but for an indefinite time their prime instructor has ordained that the only pastor shall be the Bible, with her book called \"SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES.\" In the tower is a room devoted to her, and called Mother's Room, furnished with all conveniences for living, should she wish to make it a home by day or night. Therein is a portrait of her in stained glass; and an electric light, behind an antique lamp, kept perpetually burning in her honor; though she has not yet visited her temple, which was dedicated on New Year's Sunday, in a somewhat novel way.  There was no special sentence or prayer of consecration; but continuous services were held from nine to four o'clock, every hour and a half, so long as there were attendants; and some people heard these exercises four times repeated. The printed program was for some reason not followed, certain hymns and psalms being omitted. There was singing by a choir and congregation. The _pater noster_ was repeated in the way peculiar to Christian Scientists, the congregation repeating one sentence and the leader responding with its parallel interpretation by Mrs. Eddy. Antiphonal paragraphs were read from the book of Revelation and her work respectively. The sermon, prepared by Mrs. Eddy, was well adapted for its purpose, and read by a professional elocutionist, not an adherent of the order, Mrs. Henrietta Clark Bemis, in a clear, emphatic style. The solo singer, however, was a Scientist, Miss Elsie Lincoln; and on the platform sat Joseph Armstrong, formerly of Kansas, and now the business manager of the publication society, with the other members of the Christian Science Board of Directors--Ira C. Knapp, Edward P. Bates, Stephen A. Chase,--gentlemen officially connected with the movement. The children of believing families collected the money for the Mother Room, and seats were especially set apart for them at the second dedicatory service. Before one service was over and the auditors left by the rear doors, the front vestibule and street (despite the snowstorm) were crowded with others, waiting admission.  On the next Sunday the new order of service went into operation. There was no address of any sort, no notices, no explanation of Bible or their text-book. Judge Hanna, who was a Colorado lawyer before coming into this work, presided, reading in clear, manly, and intelligent tones, the quarterly Bible lesson, which happened that day to be on Jesus' miracle of loaves and fishes. Each paragraph he supplemented first with illustrative Scripture parallels, as set down for him, and then by passages selected for him from Mrs. Eddy's book. The place was again crowded, many having remained over a week from among the thousands of adherents who had come to Boston for this auspicious occasion from all parts of the country. The organ, made by Farrand & Votey in Detroit, at a cost of eleven thousand dollars, is the gift of a wealthy Universalist gentleman, but was not ready for the opening. It is to fill the recess behind the spacious platform, and is described as containing pneumatic windchests throughout, and having an æolian attachment. It is of three-manual compass, C.C.C. to C.4, 61 notes; and pedal compass, C.C.C. to F.30. The great organ has double open diapason (stopped bass), open diapason, dulciana, viola di gambi, doppel flute, hohl flute, octave, octave quint, superoctave, and trumpet,--65 pipes each. The swell organ has bourdon, open diapason, salicional, æoline, stopped diapason, gemshorn, flute harmonique, flageolet, cornet--3 ranks, 183,--cornopean, oboe, vox humana--61 pipes each. The choir organ, enclosed in separate swell-box, has geigen principal, dolce, concert flute, quintadena, fugara, flute d'amour, piccolo harmonique, clarinet,--61 pipes each. The pedal organ has open diapson, bourden, lieblich gedeckt (from stop 10), violoncello-wood,--30 pipes each. Couplers: swell to great; choir to great; swell to choir; swell to great octaves, swell to great sub-octaves; choir to great sub-octaves; swell octaves; swell to pedal; great to pedal; choir to pedal. Mechanical accessories: swell tremulant, choir tremulant, bellows signal; wind indicator. Pedal movements: three affecting great and pedal stops, three affecting swell and pedal stops; great to pedal reversing pedal; crescendo and full organ pedal; balanced great and choir pedal; balanced swell pedal.  Beautiful suggestions greet you in every part of this unique church, which is practical as well as poetic, and justifies the name given by Mrs. Eddy, which stands at the head of this sketch. J.H.W.     (_Boston Journal_, January 7, 1895.)  CHIMES RANG SWEETLY.   Much admiration was expressed by all those fortunate enough to listen to the first peal of the chimes in the tower of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, corner of Falmouth and Norway streets, dedicated yesterday. The sweet, musical tones attracted quite a throng of people, who listened with delight.  The chimes were made by the United States Tubular Bell Company, of Methuen, Mass., and are something of a novelty in this country, though for some time well and favorably known in the Old Country, especially in England.  They are a substitution of tubes of drawn brass for the heavy cast bells of old-fashioned chimes. They have the advantage of great economy of space, as well as of cost, a chime of fifteen bells not occupying a space of more than five by eight feet.  Where the old-fashioned chimes required a strong man to ring them, these can be rung from an electric key board, and even when rung by hand require but little muscular power to manipulate them, and call forth all the purity and sweetness of their tones. The quality of tone is something superb, being rich and mellow. The tubes are carefully tuned, so that the harmony is perfect. They have all the beauties of a great Cathedral chime, with infinitely less expense.  There is practically no limit to the uses to which these bells may be put. They can be called into requisition in theatres, concert halls, and public buildings, as they range in all sizes, from those described down to little sets of silver bells that might be placed on a small centre table.

Mary Baker Eddy the \"Mother\" of the Idea.--She Has an Immense Following Throughout the United States, and a Church Costing $250,000 Was Recently Built in Her Honor at Boston.   \"My faith has the strength to nourish trees as well as souls,\" was the remark Rev. Mary Baker Eddy, the \"mother\" of Christian Science, made recently as she pointed to a number of large elms that shade her delightful country home, in Concord, N.H. \"I had them brought here in warm weather almost as big as they are now, and not one died.\" This is a remarkable statement, but it is made by a remarkable woman, who has originated a new phase of religious belief, and who numbers over 100,000 intelligent people among her devoted followers.  The great hold she has upon this army was demonstrated in a very tangible and material manner recently when \"The First Church of Christ, Scientist,\" erected at a cost of $250,000, was dedicated in Boston.

He had scarcely set foot on the platform when he was confronted by his chauffeur, a young man in a neat dark-green livery, who took his master's travelling rug in one hand, while with the other he held out an envelope.  \"The housekeeper said I was to give you that as soon as you got in, sir,\" he announced. \"There's a telegram in it that came at four o'clock this afternoon--she couldn't send it on, because she didn't know exactly where it would find you in Manchester.\"  Allerdyke took the envelope, tore it open, drew out the telegram, and stepped beneath the nearest lamp. He muttered the wording of the message--  \"_On board SS. Perisco_  \"63 _miles N.N.E. Spurn Point_, 2.15 _p.m., May_ 12_th_.  \"Expect to reach Hull this evening, and shall stop Station Hotel there for night on way to London. Will you come on at once and meet me? Want to see you on most important business--  \"JAMES.\"  Allerdyke re-read this message, quietly and methodically folded it up, slipped it into his pocket, and with a swift glance at the station clock turned to his chauffeur.  \"Gaffney,\" he said, \"how long would it take us to run across to Hull?\"  The chauffeur showed no surprise at this question; he had served Allerdyke for three years, and was well accustomed to his ways.  \"Hull?\" he replied. \"Let's see, sir--that 'ud be by way of Leeds, Selby, and Howden. About sixty miles in a straight line, but there's a good bit of in-and-out work after you get past Selby, sir. I should say about four hours.\"  \"Plenty of petrol in the car?\" asked Allerdyke, turning down the platform. \"There is? What time did you have your supper?\"  \"Ten o'clock, sir,\" answered Gaffney, with promptitude.  \"Bring the car round to the hotel door in the station yard,\" commanded Allerdyke. \"You'll find a couple of Thermos flasks in the locker--bring them into the hotel lounge bar.\"  The chauffeur went off down the platform. Allerdyke turned up the covered way to the Great Northern Hotel. When the chauffeur joined him there a few minutes later he was giving orders for a supply of freshly-cut beef sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs; the Thermos flasks he handed over to be filled with hot coffee.  \"Better get something to eat now, Gaffney,\" he said. \"Get some sandwiches, or some bread and cheese, or something--it's a longish spin.\"  He himself, waiting while the chauffeur ate and drank, and the provisions were made ready, took a whisky and soda to a chair by the fire, and once more pulled out and read the telegram. And as he read he wondered why his cousin, its sender, wished so particularly to see him at once. James Allerdyke, a man somewhat younger than himself, like himself a bachelor of ample means and of a similar temperament, had of late years concerned himself greatly with various business speculations in Northern Europe, and especially in Russia. He had just been over to St. Petersburg in order to look after certain of his affairs in and near that city, and he was returning home by way of Stockholm and Christiania, in each of which towns he had other ventures to inspect. But Marshall Allerdyke was quite sure that his cousin did not wish to see him about any of these matters--anything connected with them would have kept until they met in the ordinary way, which would have happened within a day or two. No, if James had taken the trouble to send him a message by wireless from the North Sea, it meant that James was really anxious to see him at the first available moment, and would already have landed in Hull, expecting to find him there. However, with a good car, smooth roads, and a fine, moonlit night--  It was not yet twelve o'clock when Allerdyke wrapped himself up in a corner of his luxurious Rolls-Royce, saw that the box of eatables and the two Thermos flasks were safe in the locker, and told Gaffney to go ahead. He himself had the faculty of going to sleep whenever he pleased, and he went to sleep now. He was asleep as Gaffney went through Leeds and its suburbs; he slept all along the country roads which led to Selby and thence to Howden. But in the silent streets of Howden he woke with a start, to find that Gaffney had pulled up in answer to a question flung to him by the driver of another car, which had come alongside their own from the opposite direction. That car had also been pulled up; within it Allerdyke saw a woman, closely wrapped in furs.  \"What is it, Gaffney?\" he asked, letting down his own window and leaning out.  \"Wants to know which is the best way to get across the Ouse, sir,\" answered Gaffney. \"I tell him there's two ferries close by--one at Booh, the other at Langrick--but there'll be nobody to work them at this hour. Where do you want to get to?\" he went on, turning to the driver of the other car.  \"Want to strike the Great Northern main line somewhere,\" answered the driver. \"This lady wants to catch a Scotch express. I thought of Doncaster, but--\"  The window of the other car was let down, and its occupant looked out. The light of the full moon shone full on her, and Allerdyke lifted his cap to a pretty, alert-looking young woman of apparently twenty-five, who politely returned his salutation.  \"Can I give you any advice?\" asked Allerdyke. \"I understand you want--\"  \"An express train to Scotland--Edinburgh,\" replied the lady. \"I made out, on arrival at Hull, that if I motored across country I would get a train at some station on the Great Northern line--a morning express. Doncaster, Selby, York--which is nearest from wherever we are!\"  \"This is Howden,\" said Allerdyke, looking up at the great tower of the old church. \"And your best plan is to follow this road to Selby, and then to York. All the London expresses stop there, but they don't all stop at Selby or at Doncaster. And there's no road bridge over the Ouse nearer than Selby in any case.\"  \"Many thanks,\" responded the lady. \"Then,\" she went on, looking at her driver, \"you will go on to York--that is--how far?\" she added, favouring Allerdyke with a gracious smile. \"Very far?\"  \"Less than an hour's run,\" answered Gaffney for his master. \"And a good road.\"  The lady bowed; Allerdyke once more raised his cap; the two cars parted company. And Allerdyke stopped Gaffney as he was driving off again, and produced the provisions.  \"Half-past two,\" he remarked, pulling out his watch. \"You've come along in good style, Gaffney. We'll have something to eat and drink. Queer thing, eh, for anybody to motor across from Hull to catch a Great Northern express on the main line!\"  \"Mayn't be any trains out of Hull during the night, sir,\" answered Gaffney, taking a handful of sandwiches. \"They'll get one at York, anyway. Want to reach Hull at any particular time, sir?\"  \"No,\" answered Allerdyke. \"Go along as you've come. You'll have a bit of uphill work over the edge of the Wolds, now. When we strike Hull, go to the Station Hotel.\"  He went to sleep again as soon as they moved out of Howden, and he only awoke when the car stopped at the hotel door in Hull. A night-porter, hearing the buzz of the engine, came out.  \"Put the car in the garage, Gaffney, and then get yourself a bed and lie as long as you like,\" said Allerdyke. \"I'll let you know when I want you.\" He turned to the night-porter. \"You've a Mr. James Allerdyke stopping here I think?\" he went on. \"He'd come in last night from the Christiania steamer.\"  The night-porter led the way into the hotel, and towards the office.  \"Mr. Marshall Allerdyke?\" he asked of the new arrival. \"The gentleman left a card for you; I was asked to give it to you as soon as you came.\"  Allerdyke took the visiting-card which the man produced from a letter rack, and read the lines hastily scribbled on the back--  If you land here during the night, come straight up to my room--263--and rouse me out. Want to see you at once.--J.A.  Allerdyke slipped the card into his pocket and turned to the night-porter.  \"My cousin wants me to go up to his room at once,\" he said. \"Just show me the way. Do you happen to know what time he got in last night?\" he continued, as they went upstairs. \"Was it late?\"  \"Passengers from the _Perisco_, sir?\" answered the night-porter. \"There were several of 'em came in last night--she got into the river about eight-thirty. It 'ud be a bit after nine o'clock when your friend came in.\"  Allerdyke's mind went back to the meeting at Howden.  \"Did you have a lady set off from here in the middle of the night?\" he asked, out of sheer curiosity. \"A lady in a motor-car?\"  \"Oh! that lady,\""]]]
