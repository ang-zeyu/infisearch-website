Jack scanned the eastern horizon with his glass.  \"See anything?\" asked Frank.  \"Thought I did,\" was the reply, \"but whatever I saw has disappeared now. Guess I must have been mistaken.\"  But Jack had not been mistaken.  Far back, even now, a fleet of perhaps a dozen German air planes were speeding westward. For the most part they were small craft, having a capacity of not more than three men, with the single exception of one machine, which, larger than the rest, carried four men. The air planes were strung out for considerable distance, no two being closer than two hundred yards together.  And in this manner they overtook the hydroplane driven by Frank and Jack.  Jack, again surveying the horizon with his night glass, gave an exclamation.  \"Here they come, Frank,\" he said. \"Let her out a little more.\"  Frank obeyed without question and the speed of the hydroplane increased from something more than thirty miles an hour to almost sixty. And still the Germans gained.  \"This will do,\" said Jack, leaning close to Frank. \"They'll overtake us, but believing we are of their number, there is little likelihood that they will investigate us very closely. We can fall in line without trouble and accompany them wherever they go.\"  \"Suits me,\" said Frank. \"Just keep me posted on their proximity.\"  Gradually the Germans reduced the distance and at length the first plane was only a few yards behind the craft in which Frank and Jack were risking their lives. The German craft flashed by a moment later without paying any attention to the hydroplane.  \"Little more speed, Frank,\" called Jack.  The hydroplane skimmed through the air faster than before and the next German craft did not overtake it so easily; but at length it passed, as did a third and a fourth.  \"Here's a good place for us to fall in line,\" Jack instructed.  Again Frank increased the speed of the hydroplane and it moved swiftly in the wake of the fourth German craft. After that no enemy air plane passed them.  \"Any idea where we are?\" asked Frank of his chum.  \"We're not far off the Belgian coast, but how far west I can't say,\" returned Jack. \"Don't suppose it makes any particular difference, though.\"  \"I guess not.\"  Frank became silent and gave his undivided attention to keeping the German plane ahead of him in sight.  And in this manner they proceeded for perhaps another half hour.  Then the machine ahead of Frank veered sharply to the south. Frank brought the head of his own craft in the same direction and the flight continued.  \"Headed for the Belgian or French coast, apparently,\" said Jack to himself. \"Wonder what the idea is?\"  Now the craft ahead of that in which the two boys rode reduced its speed abruptly. Frank cut down the gait of his own craft and they continued on their way more slowly.  \"Nearing our destination, wherever that is,\" muttered Jack.  The lad felt of his revolvers to make sure that they were ready in case of an emergency.  \"Land ahead,\" said Frank, suddenly.  Jack gazed straight before him. There, what appeared to be many miles away, though in reality it was but a few, was a dark blur below. Occasionally what appeared to be little stars twinkled there. Jack knew they were the lights of some town.  \"Guess that's where we are headed for, all right,\" he told himself.  Behind the British hydroplane the other German airships came rapidly, keeping some distance apart, however. Jack leaned close to Frank.  \"Just do as the ones ahead of you do,\" he said quietly. \"I don't know where we are nor what is likely to happen. Keep your nerve and we'll be all right.\"  \"Don't worry about me,\" responded Frank. \"I'm having the time of my life.\"  Jack smiled to himself, for he knew that Frank was telling the truth. There was nothing the lad liked better than to be engaged in a dangerous piece of work and more than once his fondness for excitement had almost ended disastrously.  \"Frank's all right if he can just keep his head,\" muttered Jack. \"I'm likely to have to hold him in check a bit, though.\"  They had approached the shore close enough now to perceive that the distant lights betokened a large town.  \"Probably Ostend,\" Jack told himself, \"though why they should come this way is too deep for me.\"  But Jack was wrong, as he learned a short time later.  The town that they now were approaching was the French port of Calais and it was still held by the French despite determined efforts of the Germans at one time or another to extend their lines that far. The capture of Calais by the Germans would have been a severe blow to England, for with the French seaport in their possession, the Germans, with their great guns, would have been able to command the English channel and a considerable portion of the North Sea coast.  When it appeared that the German aircraft would fly directly over the city, the leading machine suddenly swerved to the east. The others followed suit.  The night was very dark, and in spite of the occasional searchlight that was flashed into the air by the French in Calais, the Teuton machines so far had been undiscovered. Now, hanging low over the land, a sudden bombardment broke out from the German air planes.  It was not the sound of bombs that came to the lads' ears; rather the sharp \"crack! crack!\" of revolver firing. Jack and Frank gazed about them quickly, for they believed, for the moment, that the Germans had encountered a squadron of French airships.  But there was no other machine in sight save the German craft.  \"What in the world is the meaning of this?\" Frank asked of Jack.  \"Don't know,\" returned the lad, \"but I guess I'd better join in.\"  He drew his revolver and fired several shots in the air.  \"Seems to be expected of us,\" he said. \"We don't want to disappoint them.\"  The German aircraft now headed straight for the city of Calais. Frank sent his machine speeding in the same direction. Then, just as it appeared they would fly directly above the city, the first German craft began to descend. The others did likewise and a moment or so later they all came to earth in the center of what Frank and Jack could see was a small army camp; and as they alighted from their machines, the lads saw that it was an Allied camp and not a German.  \"Must be Calais,\" said Frank to Jack in a whisper. \"Have we been mistaken? Are these French and British machines?\"  \"Well, it looks like it,\" returned Jack. \"We'll keep quiet and let the other fellows do the talking.\"  A French officer now approached the pilot of the first aircraft.  \"We heard the firing aloft a moment ago,\" he said. \"Did you encounter the enemy?\"  \"We were pursued all the way from the German lines,\" was the reply.  \"Anyone hit?\"  \"I think not, though I believe we accounted for one or two of the enemy.\"  \"Good. Will you fly again tonight?\"  \"Yes; but not before midnight.\"  The French officer withdrew.  At this one of the aviators raised a hand and the others gathered about him, Frank and Jack with them. All wore khaki clothing and their features were concealed by heavy goggles.  \"Careful,\" whispered the aviator. \"A false move and we are discovered. Spread out now and see what you can learn. Gather here at midnight.\"  He waved a hand and the Germans, for such Jack and Frank now knew them to be, separated. When the two lads were alone a moment later, Jack said:  \"Well, this is what I call a piece of nervy business. What shall we do? Inform the French commander immediately?\"  \"No. I have a better plan that that. They can hardly work any mischief tonight. What information they learn will avail them naught for we can warn the French commander later. We must find out what they are up to. We'll stick close and follow them back to the German lines, if necessary.\"  \"Good, then! Guess we had better do a little skirmishing about. It will keep suspicion from us should we be watched.\"  \"All right,\" said Frank. \"Come on.\"    CHAPTER VIII  A STARTLING DISCOVERY   With the coming of midnight Frank and Jack returned to the spot where the aeroplanes had been parked. Several of the German aviators already had returned. The man who appeared to be the leader announced that they would await the arrival of the others before taking to the air.  The others arrived one at a time until all were present but two. The machines were in readiness to ascend the moment the missing men arrived. The aviators were at their posts.  Suddenly there came a shout. A moment later the two German aviators who were delaying the departure burst into sight at a dead run.  \"Quick!\" called one. \"We are discovered!\"  Immediately the others--Frank and Jack among them--leaped into their machines and soared into the air. The last comers also leaped for their craft and succeeded in getting above ground just as rifles began to crack in the French camp.  Came a sudden cry from the machine nearest that of Frank and Jack. The lads saw a man rise to his feet, throw up his arms and pitch, head foremost, toward the ground. The aircraft, freed of a guiding hand, rocked a moment crazily and then turned over, hurling its other occupant into space.  There was a cry of anger from aboard some of the other German craft, but no man raised a hand to stay the flight of his car. It would have been suicide and the Germans realized it. They sped away into the darkness whence they had come. Frank and Jack, in their British hydroplane, went with them.  For an hour or two the aeroplanes sped through the darkness at undiminished speed; then the foremost craft slowed down. The others did likewise.  \"Surely we haven't reached the German lines already?\" said Jack. Frank shrugged his shoulders.  \"You know about as much of what is going on as I do,\" he returned. \"Evidently we are going down, however.\"  The lad was right.  The leading German plane swooped toward the earth and the others followed its example. A few minutes later all had reached the ground safely and their occupants had alighted.  The two lads glanced around. It was very dark."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10081"],["title","The Boy Allies at Jutland; Or, The Greatest Naval Battle of History (#7)"],["body"," short distance to the north they could see the broad expanse of the North Sea, stretching away in the night. The dark waves lapped the shore gently with a faint thrashing sound. The water was very calm.  Except for the figures that had alighted upon the shore in the darkness there was not a human being in sight. To the south, to the east and west stretched miles and miles of sand dunes. Just these sand dunes and the waters of the North Sea--there was nothing else in sight.  At a signal the men gathered around the man who appeared to be the leader. Frank and Jack thanked their lucky stars that the night was very dark, for otherwise they would have been in imminent danger of being discovered; and each lad realized that it would go hard with them should their true identities be penetrated.  The darkness served them like a shield. Nevertheless, both lads kept their hands on their revolvers. Each had determined that if discovered, he would make an effort to escape in the nearest of the aircraft. Each knew that there was little hope of such an escape, but, realizing what was in store for them should they be discovered and captured, they had decided it would be better to die fighting than to be stood up against a wall and shot, or, possibly, hanged.  The group of men on the bench became silent as the leader addressed them.  \"Men,\" he said, \"it is to be regretted that we have discovered so soon. There was still work to be done before the hour for our great effort to crush the British fleet. However, to a certain extent we have been successful. We have managed to sow the seed of suspicion in the minds of our enemies. Prisoners, whom we have allowed to be taken, have let slip words that will lead the British to think our fleet will slip from its base and approach England from the south. We know better than that. We know that on the night of May 31--which is tomorrow--our fleet will strike the British off Jutland.\"  There was a subdued cheer from the assembled Germans. The speaker continued:  \"Through our efforts the British fleet has been scattered. The main portion of the fleet lies to the south and will be unable to reach Jutland in time to save the portion of the British fleet there from destruction. Of course, should wind of the move reach the British there would still be time for the fleet to gather. But no such word will reach the enemy. After sinking the first section of the British fleet, our vessels will steam south and meet the main British fleet. The numbers will be nearer equal then. We shall be victorious.\"  Again there was a subdued cheer, in which Frank and Jack joined for the sake of appearances. Again the speaker continued:  \"I shall now explain the reason we have landed here. Our part in the work has been done. Here we shall remain until nightfall tomorrow. We shall then sail north and take part in the battle. In my pocket here,\" he tapped the breast of his coat, \"are instructions I shall read to you before we leave. Until that time we shall rest here, for we have done work enough for the present. We shall be safe here. Our position now is directly between two French lines and for that reason we shall not be disturbed. Of course, if it becomes necessary, we can take to our machines and get out of harm's way. We have provisions and water enough to last us; and while the weather is warm, it is still cool enough. At any rate, we shall have to make the best of it.\"  The man ceased speaking and beckoned the others to follow him. He walked a hundred yards to the east. There he made a mark in the sand with his foot.  \"Until the time for us to move has come,\" he said, \"let no man set foot beyond that line. I make this rule for safety's sake.\"  He walked two hundred yards from the sea itself and repeated the operation and instructions; and then to the west.  \"Within these bounds,\" he said, \"we will spend tonight and tomorrow. The man who disobeys these instructions shall be shot. Do I make myself plain?\"  There was a murmur of assent.  \"Very well,\" said the leader. \"Now you are all left to your own devices. First, however, I shall pick the watches for the night.\"  Frank and Jack, at this, slunk well back into the crowd, for they did not wish to be scrutinized closely. But they need have had no fear. The leader of the Germans laid a hand on the shoulders of the two men nearest him.  \"You two,\" he said, \"shall stand guard the remainder of the night, one to the southeast and one to the southwest. But do not venture beyond the boundaries I have laid down.\"  The Germans saluted and moved away.  The leader moved toward the sea and none of the others followed him. Instead, some walked a short distance to the east, others to the south and still others to the west. They threw themselves down in the sand. A few remained near the airships.  Frank and Jack walked a short distance toward the sea, but kept some distance behind the German leader, who stood looking off across the water, apparently deep in thought. The lads sat down upon the ground.  \"Well,\" said Frank, \"what are we going to do about it?\"  \"Do!\" echoed Jack. \"Why, there is only one thing we can do--one thing we must do! We must get away from here and warn the fleet!\"  \"All right,\" said Frank, \"it sounds easy; but how?\"  \"Well, that doesn't make any difference. We've got to do it.\"  \"And the moment we have gone our absence will be discovered, the Germans will know the fleet has been warned and the attack will be given up,\" said Frank. \"And we don't want anything like that to happen. It will be the first time the Germans have mustered up courage enough to come out and give battle. We don't want to frighten them off.\"  \"We don't want to let them sneak up on a part of our fleet unguarded, either,\" declared Jack.  \"Of course not. You say we must give the warning. We'll try, of course. But first, why not let's put all the aeroplanes except the one we want out of commission?\"  \"By Jove! a good plan! We'll do it.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Frank. \"Then there is still another thing.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"Why, we want the instructions that fellow carries,\" and Frank waved a hand in the direction of the German leader. \"He was kind enough to let us know he has them. We'll have to take them away from him.\"  \"Say!\" exclaimed Jack, \"you've laid out quite a job for us, haven't you?\"  \"It's got to be done,\" declared Frank.  \"Well, all right, but we shall have to be careful.\"  \"Right you are,\" Frank agreed, \"one little slip and the whole thing will be spoiled.\"  \"Then there must be no slip,\" said Jack, quietly  \"I agree with you there. Now the question arise? as how the thing may best be done.\"  \"We'll have to wait until they're all asleep,\" said Jack.  \"You forget the sentinels won't sleep,\" said Frank.  \"No, I don't; and they will be the first disposed of. They are not looking for enemies from within, you know. You walk up to one and I'll walk up to the other. We'll be challenged when we get close, of course. Then it will be up to us to silence those fellows before they can make an outcry.\"  \"We'll try it. Then what?\"  \"Then we'll come back and put the airships out of commission as carefully as possible.\"  \"That's easy enough. All we have to do is to let out the 'gas.'\"  \"Next we'll have to go through the commander's pockets without arousing him.\"  \"That's more difficult, but I suppose it can be done.\"  \"Next we'll have to get our hydroplane to the water. Fortunately, we came down closer to the sea than the others. We should be able to do that without awakening the sleepers.\"  \"Then,\" said Frank, \"we climb in and say goodbye, eh?\"  \"That's it.\"  \"All right. We'll work it that way then. It's as good as any other. Now we'll keep quiet until we are sure everyone is asleep.\"  Their plans thus arranged, the lads became quiet. They said not a word as they waited for sleep to overcome the Germans, but gazed out quietly over the dark sea.    CHAPTER IX  THE PLAN WORKS--ALMOST   \"Time to get busy.\"  It was Frank who spoke. All was quiet among the sand dunes. The commander of the Germans had laid down upon the ground, some distance from the others, half an hour before. Snores from various points announced that most of the men were sleeping soundly.  Jack and Frank got to their feet  \"Careful,\" said Jack as they separated. \"Remember, don't give your man a chance to let out a cry.\"  Frank nodded in the darkness and walked slowly toward the sentinel he had selected to silence. Jack moved in the other direction.  As Jack came within a few yards of his prey, the man raised his rifle and commanded:  \"Halt!\"  \"It's all right,\" said Jack. \"I couldn't sleep and it was lonesome back there. I want company.\"  The German lowered his rifle.  \"It's lonesome here, too,\" he said. \"Wish you had been selected for my job.\"  \"I wouldn't have minded it tonight,\" said Jack, approaching closer.  The German reached in his pocket and produced a pack of cigarettes. He extended the pack to Jack.  \"Have one?\" he invited.  Jack accepted a cigarette.  The German produced a match. He laid his rifle upon the ground as he struck the match upon the leg of his trousers.  It was the moment for which Jack had been waiting.  Quickly his revolver leaped out. In almost the same instant he reversed it and before the German realized what was about to happen he brought the butt down on the man's head with great force.  The man fell to the ground without a sound.  Frank, advancing upon the other German, also was challenged when he drew close, but he, too, engaged his prey in conversation. As the man turned his head for a moment to gaze across the dark sand, the lad struck him violently over the head with his revolver butt. The German dropped like a log.  A few moments later Frank and Jack met again near the first aeroplane.  \"It'll have to be quick work here,\" Jack warned \"We haven't a whole lot of time, you know.\"  Frank nodded that he understood. Rapidly they passed from one plane to another letting out the gasoline. Five minutes later, "]]]
