Then what made you go off and shut the house up?\"  \"O, we didn't expect you till to-morrow; and it's Johnny's birthday. Dinner is almost ready; aren't you glad? Such a dinner, too!\"  \"Any bill of fare?\" asked Dotty, with a sudden recollection of past grandeur.  \"A bill of fare? O, no; those are for hotels. But there's almost everything else. Now you can go up stairs with me, and wash your face.\"  Dotty appeared at table with smooth hair and a fresh ruffle which Prudy had basted in the neck of her dress. She looked very neat and prim, and, as Percy had predicted, carried her head higher than ever.  \"I suppose,\" said aunt Eastman, \"you will have a great many wonderful things to tell us, Dotty, for I am sure you travelled with your eyes open.\"  \"Yes'm; I hardly ever went to sleep in the cars. But when you said 'eyes,' auntie, it made me think of the blind children. We went to the 'Sylum to see them.\"  \"How do they look?\" asked Johnny.  \"They don't _look_ at all; they are blind.\"  \"Astonishing! I'd open my eyes if I were they.\"  \"Why, Percy, they are blind--stone-blind!\"  \"How is that? How blind is a stone?\"  Dotty busied herself with her turkey. Her Eastman cousins all had a way of rendering her very uncomfortable. They made remarks which were intended to be witty, but were only pert. They were not really kind-hearted, or they would have been more thoughtful of the feelings of others.  \"Alice,\" said dear Mrs. Read, trying to turn the conversation, \"I see thee wears a very pretty ring.\"  Dotty took it off her finger, and passed it around for inspection.  \"I never had a ring before,\" said she, with animation. \"I never had anything to wear--'cept _clothes_\"  Percy laughed.  \"I found the pearl in an oyster stew, grandma. It is such a very funny place Out West\"  \"Yes, it is really a pearl,\" said Percy, \"only spoiled by boiling. Look her, Toddlekins; oysters don't grow Out West; they grow here on the coast. You'd better study astronomy.\"  Dotty took refuge in silence again, like an oyster withdrawing into his shell.  \"O, Dotty,\" said Susy, presently, \"tell me what you saw Out West. I want to hear all about it.\"  \"Well, I saw a pandrammer,\" replied Dotty, briefly.  \"What in the world is that?\" said Johnny.  \"It is a long picture, and they keep pulling it out like India rubber.\"  \"She means a _panorama_\" cried Johnny. \"Why, I went to one last night. We can see as much as you can, without going Out West, either.\"  Here was another sensation. Dotty might as well have been eating ashes as the delirious dinner before her.  \"Don't you like your pudding, dear?\" asked aunt Eastman.  \"O, yes'm; I always like _coker-whacker\"_ replied the unfortunate Dotty, stumbling over the word _tapioca_.  In spite of their mother's warning frown, the three young Eastmans laughed, while Susy and Prudy, who had kinder hearts and better manners, drew down their mouths with the greatest solemnity.  \"I ain't going to speak another word,\" cried the persecuted little traveller, setting down her goblet, and hitting it against her plate till it rang again.  \"_Error!_\" called out Florence from the other side of the table; \"there's no such word as _ain't_.\"  This was too much. Dotty had smarted under these cruel blows long enough. She hastily arose from the table, and rushed out of the room.  \"Florence and Percy, you are both very thoughtless,\" said Mrs. Eastman, reprovingly.  Mrs. Parlin looked deeply pained, as she always did when her little daughter gave way to her temper; but she made no allusion to the subject, and tried to go on with her dinner as if nothing had happened.  Dotty ran into the front yard, threw herself on the ground, and buried her face in a verbena bed.  There! it wasn't of any use; she couldn't be good; it wouldn't last! When she had just come home, and had so many things to tell, and supposed everybody would be glad to see her and hear her talk,--why, Percy and Florence must just spoil it all by laughing. O, it was too bad!  \"I wish I hadn't come! I wish I'd been switched off!\" sighed Dotty, meaning, if she meant anything, that she wished the cars had whirled her away to the ends of the earth, instead of bringing her home, where people were all ready with one accord to trample her into the dust.  \"Here I've been 'way off, and know how to travel, and keep my ticket in my glove. Six years old, going on seven. Been down in a coal mine,--Prudy never'd dare to. Had a jigger cut out of my side. Been to the 'Sylum. One of the conductors said, 'That's a fine little daughter of yours, sir.' I heard him. Aunt 'Ria washed all those grease-spots out of my dress, and I had on a clean ruffle. And then, just 'cause I couldn't say _coker-whacker_--\"  \"There, there, don't feel so bad, you precious sister,\" said a soothing voice; and a soft cheek was pressed to Dotty's, and a pair of loving arms clasped her close. \"Percy was real too-bad, and so was Flossy--so there!\"  \"O, Prudy, I wish they were every one of 'em in the penitential, locked in, and Johnny too! Me just got home, and never did a single thing to them! And there they laughed right in my face!\"  \"But you know, dear, they don't think,\" said Prudy, who found it unsafe to sympathize too much with her angry sister; \"they never do think; they don't mean any harm.\"  \"I'll make 'em think!\" cried Dotty, fiercely. \"I'll scare 'em so they'll think! I'll take a pumpkin, and I'll take a watermelon, and I'll take--\"  \"Dear me, Dotty, that is a beautiful ring on your finger. I wish I had one just like it.\"  Dotty cast a suspicious glance at her sister.  \"Don't you try to pacify ME, Prudy Parlin.\"  Prudy held a handful of southernwood to her nose, and smiled behind it.  \"This isn't _temper_, Prudy Parlin, 'cause you said your own self they 'bused me.\"  \"Such a cunning little pearl!\" remarked Prudy, still admiring the ring; \"how glad I should be if you'd wish it on to my finger, Dotty!\"  \"They 'bused me, Prudy Parlin, and you know it.\"  \"Only till night, Dotty Dimple. Just wish it on till night.\"  \"Well, there,\" exclaimed Dotty, at last; \"hold out your finger if you can't stop teasing. But I _haven't_ any temper, and you needn't act just's if you's trying to pacify me.\"  \"O, thank you, Dotty; on my third finger.\"  \"Now I've wished it on, Prudy; and its a good-enough wish for you, when you won't pity me; but now I'm going up in the bathing-room to stay, and you can't make me come down--not a single step.\"  \"I shan't want you to come down, Dotty. There's the very place I'm going to myself. We'll carry up the needle-gun; it's the nicest thing to play with. Come, let's hurry up stairs the back way, little sister, for they'll be out from dinner, and see us.\"  Dotty needed no second hint. In half an hour she was so far recovered from the _megrims_ as to be hungry; when Prudy secretly begged some pudding for her of the willing Angeline.  Then the same little peacemaker went to her cousins, and made them each and all promise to be more careful of her sister's feelings; after which there was nut-cracking in the wood-shed, and a loud call for Miss Dimple, who consented to go down after much urging, and was the merriest one of the whole party.     CHAPTER V.  PLAYING TRUANT.   For several days after her return Dotty Dimple was in a state of jubilee. She had a great deal to tell, and the whole household was ready to listen. Norah would stand with a dish or a rolling-pin in her hand, and almost forget what she had intended to do in her desire to hear every word Miss Dotty was saying.  Once, when she related her adventure with the pigeon-pie, grandma Read, who was clear-starching her caps, let the starch boil over on the stove; and at another time Mrs. Parlin was so much absorbed in a description of Phebe, that she almost spiced a custard with cayenne pepper.  All these evidences of interest were very flattering to Dotty. Sometimes she took Prudy one side, and told her the same story twice over, to which Prudy always listened with unfailing politeness. As I said before, while this excitement lasted Miss Dimple was in a state of jubilee. But by and by the novelty wore off; she had told the family everything she could possibly think of, and now longed for a few pairs of fresh ears into which to pour her stories. Everybody else was working for Christmas; Dotty alone was idle; for no one had time to give her a daily stint, and see that she accomplished it.  \"After the holidays I shall have to go to school; so now is my time to play,\" said she to herself, \"and I ought to play every minute, as tight as I can spring.\"  But she tried so hard to be happy that the effort was really very tiresome. If she had only had something to do, I am almost sure she would not have fallen into the misfortune which I am about to record.  One day her mother sent her to a worsted store to pattern some worsteds. A girl behind the counter gave her the right shades, and she slowly started for home. It was about four o'clock of a November day. Dotty, glancing idly at the sky, saw that the sun was already getting low.  \"How queer it is!\" thought she; \"it seems as if the sun grows sleepy very early nowadays, and goes to bed right in the middle of the afternoon. Well, I declare, if there isn't Lina Rosenberg!\"  The beautiful little Jewess was just turning an opposite corner, and, as usual, the sight of her face bewitched Dotty in a minute.  [Illustration: LINA ROSENBERG INVITES DOTTY TO HER HOUSE.]  \"O, Lina Rosenberg, come over here! How do you do?\"  \"I'm very well, Dotty: how do YOU do? Only I wish you wouldn't call me a BUG!\"  \"Well, then, Lina, you mustn't have bugs in your name if you don't want to be called by 'em. Did you know I'd been Out West?\"  \"No; you haven't, Dotty Dimple!\"  \"Yes, I have; you may ask my father. I kept my own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10320"],["title","Dotty Dimple at Play (#5)"],["body","right in my glove, and took 'most the whole care of myself. Went to the Blind 'Sylum; found a pearl in an oyster; been 'way down in a coal mine; and--and--\"  \"Come to my house, won't you, and tell me all about it?\" said Lina Rosenberg, looking as beguiling as possible, and taking Dotty's unresisting hand.  Dotty knew very well that her mother would never allow her to go to Lina's house; but she did not like to say that, and she only replied,--  \"I've matched my worsteds, and now I must go home.\"  \"O, you can go home afterwards. My mother said to me to-day, 'Do you bring Dotty Dimple home to supper this very night. She'll be so glad to see you!'\"  Dotty gave another glance at the sky, then one at the city clock.  \"What time do you drink tea, Lina?\"  \"At five, 'most always.\"  Dotty had long felt a great curiosity about the domestic affairs of the Jews; and here was an unexpected opportunity to sit down at the very table with them. She had an invitation from the head of the family, and that was something which did not happen every day. She could go home any time afterwards; for their own tea-hour was not till half past six.  \"I'll walk along with you a little way, Lina, and think it over.\"  It was true Mrs. Parlin did not approve of Mandoline or any of her family; but Dotty thought she would forget that, just for once.  \"O, dear! I keep thinking how my mamma said, 'I do not wish you to play with Lina Rosenberg!' Now I can 'most always forget easy enough; but when I TRY to forget, it says itself over and over--and I remember just as hard!\"  As they turned another corner they met Susy, who had been sent to the dye-house.  \"Why, Dotty,\" said she, \"what are you doing on that street?\"  Lina spoke up very boldly,--  \"She's going to the doctor's with me, Susy Parlin, to get a plaster for my mother.\"  At this wicked speech Dotty's heart almost sank into her boots; for she had never known before that Lina would tell a deliberate lie.  Lina lived in a little grocery store. Her father was gone away to-day,> and her mother had just served a customer with a pound of damp brown sugar, saying, as she clipped the string,--  \"It's very cheap sweetening at that price; we are going to rise on it to-morrow.\"  After that she stood a minute in front of the store, and shook her head at Jacob, a little boy, some three years old, who was trying to balance a patent washboard against a tree which grew out of the brick pavement. It was a large, scrawny tree, which looked as if it was obliged to live there, but didn't want to, and had tried in vain to get burnt up in the Portland fire. From the lower branches of the tree depended a couple of dun-colored hams, and a painted board, with the words, \"Good Family Butter.\"  \"Come in, Jacob, you naughty boy!\" said Mrs. Rosenberg, this time shaking him, because she was afraid he would injure the patent wash-board. Then Jacob, who had been waiting for the shaking, and would not stir without it, went in at the side door crying; for the family lived in one end of the store.  Mrs. Rosenberg had a great many children, and was obliged to work very hard at various employments. Just now she went to spreading pumpkin-seeds to dry under the stove. She was not expecting company; and when Mandoline entered with Dotty, she looked up from her work with a frown.  \"Who've you brought home with you this time, Mandoline Rosenberg?\" said she. \"Take off your hat and hang it over them tommatuses; but mind yer don't drop it into that dish of lard.\"  \"Mother,\" pleaded Mandoline, \"we want to go up chamber to see my pretty things; her mother sent her a-purpose.\"  \"No, she didn't; no such a thing! You're a master hand to pick up children and fetch 'em home here, and then crawl out of it by lying! Besides, you've got to knit. I must have those socks done by to-morrow noon, Mandy, or I'll know the reason why.\"  As Mrs. Rosenberg spoke, she pushed a waiter full of seeds under the stove as if she hated the very sight of them; and when she stood up again, Dotty observed that her dirty calico dress did not come anywhere near the tops of her calf-skin shoes.  \"But, mother,\" said Mandoline, with a winning smile, \"this is Dotty Dimple, the little girl that gave me the needle-book.\"  This was partly true. Dotty had given Mandoline an old needle-book; but it had been in return for some maple sugar, which the little Jewess had pilfered from her father's store.  \"Dotty Dimple, is it?\" said Mrs. Rosenberg, with a sharp look at the little guest.  \"I don't know now any better than I did before. That's a name for a doll-baby; I should say.\"  \"Alice Parlin, mother.\"  \"Is it? O, well; you may take her up stairs out of my way; but mind, you must knit every minute you're gone.\"  Dotty was greatly abashed by this reception, and would have rushed out of the house, but Mandoline held her fast.  \"You shan't go a step,\" said she, \"I'll hide your hat.\"  So Dotty, under peril of going home bareheaded, was obliged to creep up the rickety staircase with Mandoline. She likened her feelings on the occasion to those of a person whom \"the mayor is putting in the lockup.\" Indeed, the \"lock-up\" was Dotty's dream of all the horrors, and she had no doubt it was the mayor himself who always stood with his hands outstretched, ready to thrust wicked people into it.  The chamber which the little girls entered was an unfinished one, and from the rafters hung paper bags of dried herbs; for, besides being a housekeeper and clerk, Mrs. Rosenberg was something of a doctress withal, and made \"bitters\" for her particular friends.  \"Sit down here on the bed, Dotty Dimple, and look at my paper dolls,\" said Lina, producing from under a disjointed chair, an old cigar box full of paper heroes and heroines. Mandoline was an artist in he! way, and these figures were clad in the most brilliant costumes of silver and gold. Dotty was dazzled. Never before had it been her lot to see such magnificent dolls,--dolls which shone so in the sun; every one of them a king or a queen, and fit to wear a crown.  \"O, Lina,\" sighed she, in ecstasy, \"where _do_ you get your silver and gold?\"  \"Tease for it,\" replied the little Jewess.  Dotty knew, to her own sorrow, that Lina was capable of teasing. It was hard to keep so much as an apple or a peppermint away from her if she happened to set her heart on it.  \"I'll give you twenty dolls,\" said Lina, \"if you'll let me have your ring; and it isn't a very pretty ring, either; looks like brass.\"  Dotty locked her fingers together.  \"You can't tease away my owny dony pearl, Lina, if it _is_ brass; so you needn't try.\"  \"Mandoline!\" called out Mrs. Rosenberg's sharp voice from down stairs, \"are you at work?\"  \"O, dear!\" said Lina, sauntering along to an old chest, and taking her knitting from the top of it; \"that's always the way. I thought if you came, mother'd let me play.\"  Dotty understood from this remark why Lina had asked her to go home with her. It was not because she wished to hear any of Dotty's brilliant stories, for she had not asked a single question about Out West; it was because she hoped for a reprieve from the dreaded knitting.  \"She's a real naughty little girl,\" thought Miss Dimple; \"and if she hadn't hided my hat, I'd go right home.\"  There was a heavy tread on the stairs. Mrs. Rosenberg was coming up, partly to see if her daughter was knitting, and partly to hang a paper bag on the long pole overhead. Mandoline was dreadfully afraid of her mother, and, in her eagerness to be found hard at work, she rattled her needles very fast, while her fingers wandered aimlessly about among the stitches. Mrs. Rosenberg detected the cheat at once; and, as she was needing the money for the socks, she scolded Mandoline soundly, and pelted her pretty little hands, rat, tat, tat, with a steel thimble.  Dotty was a little startled, and peeped out at Lina from the corners of her eyes. Mrs. Rosenberg scolded so hard that the paper bags overhead seemed to rattle, and some yellow pollen dropped out of one of them like shooting stars.  Dotty had never known that there are such cruel people in the world; but let me tell you, little reader, every mother is not like the gentle, low-voiced woman who takes you in her lap, and kindly reproves you when you have done wrong. No; there are very different mothers; hard-working, ignorant ones, who do not know how to treat their children any more than you know how to build a brick house.  Mrs. Rosenberg was so severe and unreasonable, that her little daughter, through fear of her, had learned to deceive. Still Mrs. Rosenberg loved Mandoline, and would have been a better mother, perhaps, if she had only known how, and had not had so much work to do.  Presently she went down stairs, and left the little girls together.  \"Good!\" said Lina, in a low voice. \"She's gone; now we'll play.\"  \"But you can't knit if you play, Lina. Tell me where you hided my hat, 'cause I want to go home.\"  \"You shan't go home till after supper, you little darling Dotty Dimple.\"  \"O, but I must go, for my mother doesn't know where I am,\" said Dotty, in a dreary tone. She had no longer any curiosity regarding Jewish suppers; all she wanted was the liberty to get away. But it is always easier to fall into a trap than to get out of it. Mandoline would not produce the missing hat, and it was no light matter for Dotty to go down stairs, among the noisy, quarrelsome children, and beg the severe Mrs. Rosenberg to take her part. If she did so, perhaps the woman would pelt her with the steel thimble. Perhaps, too, she would say Mandoline might keep the hat. So Dotty played \"synagogue,\" and all the while the sun was dropping down, down the sky, as if it had a leaden weight attached to it, to make it go faster.     CHAPTER VI.  A STRANGE VISIT.   The same warfare of words continued to come up from the kitchen, and presently the odor of sausages stole up, too; Mrs. Rosenberg was preparing supper. It seemed to the impatient Dotty that she was a long while"]]]
