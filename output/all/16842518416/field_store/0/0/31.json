But in commensuration of our wages     With our desert is portion of our joy,     Because we see them neither less nor greater.  Herein doth living Justice sweeten so     Affection in us, that for evermore     It cannot warp to any iniquity.  Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;     So in this life of ours the seats diverse     Render sweet harmony among these spheres;  And in the compass of this present pearl     Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom     The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.  But the Provencals who against him wrought,     They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he     Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.  Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,     Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him     Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;  And then malicious words incited him     To summon to a reckoning this just man,     Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.  Then he departed poor and stricken in years,     And if the world could know the heart he had,     In begging bit by bit his livelihood,  Though much it laud him, it would laud him more.”     Paradiso: Canto VII   “Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,     Superillustrans claritate tua     Felices ignes horum malahoth!”  In this wise, to his melody returning,     This substance, upon which a double light     Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,  And to their dance this and the others moved,     And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks     Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.  Doubting was I, and saying, “Tell her, tell her,”     Within me, “tell her,” saying, “tell my Lady,”     Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;  And yet that reverence which doth lord it over     The whole of me only by B and ICE,     Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.  Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;     And she began, lighting me with a smile     Such as would make one happy in the fire:  “According to infallible advisement,     After what manner a just vengeance justly     Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,  But I will speedily thy mind unloose;     And do thou listen, for these words of mine     Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.  By not enduring on the power that wills     Curb for his good, that man who ne’er was born,     Damning himself damned all his progeny;  Whereby the human species down below     Lay sick for many centuries in great error,     Till to descend it pleased the Word of God  To where the nature, which from its own Maker     Estranged itself, he joined to him in person     By the sole act of his eternal love.  Now unto what is said direct thy sight;     This nature when united to its Maker,     Such as created, was sincere and good;  But by itself alone was banished forth     From Paradise, because it turned aside     Out of the way of truth and of its life.  Therefore the penalty the cross held out,     If measured by the nature thus assumed,     None ever yet with so great justice stung,  And none was ever of so great injustice,     Considering who the Person was that suffered,     Within whom such a nature was contracted.  From one act therefore issued things diverse;     To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;     Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.  It should no longer now seem difficult     To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance     By a just court was afterward avenged.  But now do I behold thy mind entangled     From thought to thought within a knot, from which     With great desire it waits to free itself.  Thou sayest, ‘Well discern I what I hear;     But it is hidden from me why God willed     For our redemption only this one mode.’  Buried remaineth, brother, this decree     Unto the eyes of every one whose nature     Is in the flame of love not yet adult.  Verily, inasmuch as at this mark     One gazes long and little is discerned,     Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.  Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn     All envy, burning in itself so sparkles     That the eternal beauties it unfolds.  Whate’er from this immediately distils     Has afterwards no end, for ne’er removed     Is its impression when it sets its seal.  Whate’er from this immediately rains down     Is wholly free, because it is not subject     Unto the influences of novel things.  The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;     For the blest ardour that irradiates all things     In that most like itself is most vivacious.  With all of these things has advantaged been     The human creature; and if one be wanting,     From his nobility he needs must fall.  ’Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,     And render him unlike the Good Supreme,     So that he little with its light is blanched,  And to his dignity no more returns,     Unless he fill up where transgression empties     With righteous pains for criminal delights.  Your nature when it sinned so utterly     In its own seed, out of these dignities     Even as out of Paradise was driven,  Nor could itself recover, if thou notest     With nicest subtilty, by any way,     Except by passing one of these two fords:  Either that God through clemency alone     Had pardon granted, or that man himself     Had satisfaction for his folly made.  Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss     Of the eternal counsel, to my speech     As far as may be fastened steadfastly!  Man in his limitations had not power     To satisfy, not having power to sink     In his humility obeying then,  Far as he disobeying thought to rise;     And for this reason man has been from power     Of satisfying by himself excluded.  Therefore it God behoved in his own ways     Man to restore unto his perfect life,     I say in one, or else in both of them.  But since the action of the doer is     So much more grateful, as it more presents     The goodness of the heart from which it issues,  Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,     Has been contented to proceed by each     And all its ways to lift you up again;  Nor ’twixt the first day and the final night     Such high and such magnificent proceeding     By one or by the other was or shall be;  For God more bounteous was himself to give     To make man able to uplift himself,     Than if he only of himself had pardoned;  And all the other modes were insufficient     For justice, were it not the Son of God     Himself had humbled to become incarnate.  Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,     Return I to elucidate one place,     In order that thou there mayst see as I do.  Thou sayst: ‘I see the air, I see the fire,     The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures     Come to corruption, and short while endure;  And these things notwithstanding were created;’     Therefore if that which I have said were true,     They should have been secure against corruption.  The Angels, brother, and the land sincere     In which thou art, created may be called     Just as they are in their entire existence;  But all the elements which thou hast named,     And all those things which out of them are made,     By a created virtue are informed.  Created was the matter which they have;     Created was the informing influence     Within these stars that round about them go.  The soul of every brute and of the plants     By its potential temperament attracts     The ray and motion of the holy lights;  But your own life immediately inspires     Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it     So with herself, it evermore desires her.  And thou from this mayst argue furthermore     Your resurrection, if thou think again     How human flesh was fashioned at that time  When the first parents both of them were made.”     Paradiso: Canto VIII   The world used in its peril to believe     That the fair Cypria delirious love     Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;  Wherefore not only unto her paid honour     Of sacrifices and of votive cry     The ancient nations in the ancient error,  But both Dione honoured they and Cupid,     That as her mother, this one as her son,     And said that he had sat in Dido’s lap;  And they from her, whence I beginning take,     Took the denomination of the star     That woos the sun, now following, now in front.  I was not ware of our ascending to it;     But of our being in it gave full faith     My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.  And as within a flame a spark is seen,     And as within a voice a voice discerned,     When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,  Within that light beheld I other lamps     Move in a circle, speeding more and less,     Methinks in measure of their inward vision.  From a cold cloud descended never winds,     Or visible or not, so rapidly     They would not laggard and impeded seem  To any one who had those lights divine     Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration     Begun at first in the high Seraphim.  And behind those that most in front appeared     Sounded “Osanna!” so that never since     To hear again was I without desire.  Then unto us more nearly one approached,     And it alone began: “We all are ready     Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.  We turn around with the celestial Princes,     One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,     To whom thou in the world of old didst say,  ‘Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;’     And are so full of love, to pleasure thee     A little quiet will not be less sweet.”  After these eyes of mine themselves had offered     Unto my Lady reverently, and she     Content and certain of herself had made them,  Back to the light they turned, which so great promise     Made of itself, and “Say, who art thou?” was     My voice, imprinted with a great affection.  O how and how much I beheld it grow     With the new joy that superadded was     Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!  Thus changed, it said to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1003"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Paradise (#5)"],["body","me: “The world possessed me     Short time below; and, if it had been more,     Much evil will be which would not have been.  My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,     Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me     Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.  Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;     For had I been below, I should have shown thee     Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.  That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself     In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,     Me for its lord awaited in due time,  And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned     With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,     Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.  Already flashed upon my brow the crown     Of that dominion which the Danube waters     After the German borders it abandons;  And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky     ’Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf     Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)  Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,     Would have awaited her own monarchs still,     Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,  If evil lordship, that exasperates ever     The subject populations, had not moved     Palermo to the outcry of ‘Death! death!’  And if my brother could but this foresee,     The greedy poverty of Catalonia     Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;  For verily ’tis needful to provide,     Through him or other, so that on his bark     Already freighted no more freight be placed.  His nature, which from liberal covetous     Descended, such a soldiery would need     As should not care for hoarding in a chest.”  “Because I do believe the lofty joy     Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,     Where every good thing doth begin and end  Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful     Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,     That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.  Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,     Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,     How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.”  This I to him; and he to me: “If I     Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest     Thy face thou’lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.  The Good which all the realm thou art ascending     Turns and contents, maketh its providence     To be a power within these bodies vast;  And not alone the natures are foreseen     Within the mind that in itself is perfect,     But they together with their preservation.  For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth     Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,     Even as a shaft directed to its mark.  If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk     Would in such manner its effects produce,     That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.  This cannot be, if the Intelligences     That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,     And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.  Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?”     And I: “Not so; for ’tis impossible     That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.”  Whence he again: “Now say, would it be worse     For men on earth were they not citizens?”     “Yes,” I replied; “and here I ask no reason.”  “And can they be so, if below they live not     Diversely unto offices diverse?     No, if your master writeth well for you.”  So came he with deductions to this point;     Then he concluded: “Therefore it behoves     The roots of your effects to be diverse.  Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,     Another Melchisedec, and another he     Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.  Revolving Nature, which a signet is     To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,     But not one inn distinguish from another;  Thence happens it that Esau differeth     In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes     From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.  A generated nature its own way     Would always make like its progenitors,     If Providence divine were not triumphant.  Now that which was behind thee is before thee;     But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,     With a corollary will I mantle thee.  Evermore nature, if it fortune find     Discordant to it, like each other seed     Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;  And if the world below would fix its mind     On the foundation which is laid by nature,     Pursuing that, ’twould have the people good.  But you unto religion wrench aside     Him who was born to gird him with the sword,     And make a king of him who is for sermons;  Therefore your footsteps wander from the road.”     Paradiso: Canto IX   Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles     Had me enlightened, he narrated to me     The treacheries his seed should undergo;  But said: “Be still and let the years roll round;”     So I can only say, that lamentation     Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.  And of that holy light the life already     Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,     As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.  Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,     Who from such good do turn away your hearts,     Directing upon vanity your foreheads!  And now, behold, another of those splendours     Approached me, and its will to pleasure me     It signified by brightening outwardly.  The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were     Upon me, as before, of dear assent     To my desire assurance gave to me.  “Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,     Thou blessed spirit,” I said, “and give me proof     That what I think in thee I can reflect!”  Whereat the light, that still was new to me,     Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,     As one delighted to do good, continued:  “Within that region of the land depraved     Of Italy, that lies between Rialto     And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,  Rises a hill, and mounts not very high,     Wherefrom descended formerly a torch     That made upon that region great assault.  Out of one root were born both I and it;     Cunizza was I called, and here I shine     Because the splendour of this star o’ercame me.  But gladly to myself the cause I pardon     Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;     Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.  Of this so luculent and precious jewel,     Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,     Great fame remained; and ere it die away  This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.     See if man ought to make him excellent,     So that another life the first may leave!  And thus thinks not the present multitude     Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,     Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.  But soon ’twill be that Padua in the marsh     Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,     Because the folk are stubborn against duty;  And where the Sile and Cagnano join     One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,     For catching whom e’en now the net is making.  Feltro moreover of her impious pastor     Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be     That for the like none ever entered Malta.  Ample exceedingly would be the vat     That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,     And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,  Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift     To show himself a partisan; and such gifts     Will to the living of the land conform.  Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,     From which shines out on us God Judicant,     So that this utterance seems good to us.”  Here it was silent, and it had the semblance     Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel     On which it entered as it was before.  The other joy, already known to me,     Became a thing transplendent in my sight,     As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.  Through joy effulgence is acquired above,     As here a smile; but down below, the shade     Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.  “God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,     Thy sight is,” said I, “so that never will     Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;  Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens     Glad, with the singing of those holy fires     Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,  Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?     Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning     If I in thee were as thou art in me.”  “The greatest of the valleys where the water     Expands itself,” forthwith its words began,     “That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,  Between discordant shores against the sun     Extends so far, that it meridian makes     Where it was wont before to make the horizon.  I was a dweller on that valley’s shore     ’Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short     Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.  With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly     Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,     That with its blood once made the harbour hot.  Folco that people called me unto whom     My name was known; and now with me this heaven     Imprints itself, as I did once with it;  For more the daughter of Belus never burned,     Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,     Than I, so long as it became my locks,  Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded     was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,     When Iole he in his heart had locked.  Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,     Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,     But at the power which ordered and foresaw.  Here we behold the art that doth adorn     With such affection, and the good discover     Whereby the world above turns that below.  But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear     Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,     Still farther to proceed behoveth me.  Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light     That here beside me thus is scintillating,     Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.  Then know thou, that within there is at rest     Rahab, and being to our order joined,     With her in its supremest grade ’tis sealed.  Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone     Cast by your world, before all other souls     First of Christ’s triumph was she taken up.  Full meet it was to leave her in some"]]]
