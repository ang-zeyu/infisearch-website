That is all, Mr. Darrin.\"  Once more saluting, Dave left the commanding officer's presence. Almost the first classmate into whom he stumbled was Dan Dalzell.  \"Well, from what quarter does the wind blow!\" murmured Dan.  Darrin repeated the interview that he had just had.  \"I'm afraid, Dave, little giant, that you've planted something of a mine under yourself,\" murmured Dalzell.  \"I feel as much convinced as ever, Danny boy, that I did just what I should have done,\" replied Darrin seriously.  \"And so does Captain Scott, and so will the commandant,\" replied Dan. \"But winning the commendation of your superior officers doesn't always imply that you'll get much praise from your classmates.\"  \"Unfortunately, you are quite right,\" smiled Dave. \"Still, I'd do the same thing over again.\"  \"Oh, of course you would,\" assented Dan. \"That's because you're Dave Darrin.\"  Here a voice like a bass horn was heard.  \"All third classmen report to the quarter-deck immediately!\"  This order was repeated in other parts of the ship. Midshipmen gathered with a rush, Pennington and Hallam being the only members absent. As soon as the third classmen, or \"youngsters,\" as they are called in midshipman parlance, had formed, the orders were read off dividing them into sections for practical instruction aboard ship during the cruise.  Dave's name was one of the first read off. He was assigned to duty as section leader for the first section in electrical instruction. Dalzell, Farley, Hallam, Pennington and others were detailed as members of that section.  The same section was also designated for steam instruction, Dalzell being made leader of the section in this branch.  The class was then dismissed. Somewhat later Pennington and Hallam returned from their interview with the commandant.  Hallam at once sought out Dave.  \"Darry, old man,\" murmured Hallam, \"Pen is as crazy as a hornet against you. As he had taken the first step by sticking himself on the pap-sheet (placing himself on report), the commandant said he would make the punishment a lighter one.\"  \"What did Pen get?\" queried Dave.  \"Fifty demerits, with all the loss of privileges that fifty carry.\"  \"He's lucky,\" declared Dave promptly. \"Had the report come from other sources, he would have been dismissed from the service.\"  \"If Pen's lucky,\" rejoined Hallam, \"he doesn't seem to realize the fact. He's calling you about everything.\"  \"He can keep that up,\" flashed Dave, \"until his toothache leaves him. Then, if he tries to carry it any further, Pen will collide with one of my fists!\"  Not much later a call sounded summoning the youngsters to the midshipmen's mess. Dave was glad to note that Pennington sat at some distance from him at table.  While the meal was in progress the \"Massachusetts\" and the other battleships got under way. The midshipmen were on deck, an hour later, when the fleet came to anchor for the night, some miles down Chesapeake Bay.  Before the youngsters were ordered to their berths that night Third Classman Pennington had found opportunity to do a good deal of talking to a few comrades who would listen to him.  Pennington was determined to stir up a hornet's nest for Dave Darrin.     CHAPTER III   MIDSHIPMAN PENNINGTON GOES TOO FAR  At eight o'clock the following morning the various sections were formed and marched to the deck.  Dave reported:  \"All present, sir.\"  The chief electrician was now summoned, and to him the section was turned over. This young man, Whittam, by name, was an enlisted man, but a bright young sample of what the Navy can do for the boy who enlists as an apprentice.  \"You will take your orders from Mr. Whittam as though he were an officer,\" directed the officer, his words intended for all members of the section, though he looked only at Darrin.  Dave saluted, then, as Chief Electrician Whittam turned to lead the way, Dave called quietly:  \"Section, left wheel--march!\"  They followed Whittam down into the dynamo room, an interesting spot for a machinist.  \"It's fine,\" muttered Dan, as he stared about him at the bright metal work, the switch-board and the revolving machines. \"But I'm afraid I couldn't learn the use and sense of all this in five years.\"  \"Silence in the section,\" commanded Dave, turning around upon his chum.  Whittam now began a short, preliminary talk upon the subjects in which the midshipmen would be required to qualify.  \"One of the first and most important requests I have to make,\" said Whittam presently, \"is that none of you touch the switches, except by direction. None of you can guess the harm that might follow the careless and ignorant handling of a switch.\"  \"It's pretty cheeky for an enlisted man to talk to midshipmen about ignorance,\" whispered Pennington to Farley.  \"Oh, I don't know--\" Farley started to reply, but Darrin's quiet voice broke in with authority:  \"Cease talking in section.\"  Farley knew this to be a merited rebuke, and accepted it as such, but Pennington's face went violently red.  \"Confound that grease-spot-chaser,\" growled Pen. \"He'll be bound to take it out of me as long as the cruise lasts. But I'll get even with him. No cheap greaser is going to ride over me!\"  That morning none of the midshipmen were called upon to handle any of the fascinating-looking machinery. Nearly the whole of this tour of practical instruction was taken up by the remarks of the chief electrician. As he spoke, Whittam moved over to one piece or another of mechanism and explained its uses. Finally, he began to question the attentive young men, to see how much of his instruction they had absorbed.  \"This is a shame, to set an enlisted man up over us as quiz-master, just to see how little we know,\" growled Pennington; but this time he had the good sense not to address his remark to anyone.  Pennington was not yet in good shape, after his harrowing experiences of the day before.  Ere the tour of instruction was over, he began to shift somewhat uneasily.  Then his attention began to wander.  A brilliantly shining brass rod near him caught his eye. Something about the glossy metal fascinated him.  Once or twice Pen put out his hand to touch the rod, but as quickly reconsidered and drew back his hand.  At last, however, the temptation proved too strong. He slid one hand along the rail.  \"Here, sir, don't handle that!\" rasped in the voice of Whittam.  Pennington drew back his hand, a flush mounting to his face.  \"The fellow has no right to talk to a midshipman in that fashion!\" quivered Pennington to himself. \"But it was the fault of that low-minded greaser Darrin, anyway. Darrin saw me, and he glanced swiftly at the chief electrician to draw attention to me.\"  It is only just to Pennington to state that he actually believed he had seen Dave do this. Darrin, however, was not guilty of the act. He had in no way sought to direct attention at Pennington.  Towards the close of the tour the officer in whose department this instruction fell passed through the dynamo room.  \"Are there any breaches of conduct to be reported, Whittam?\" inquired the officer, halting.  \"Nothing worth mentioning, sir,\" replied the chief electrician.  \"I asked you, Whittam, whether there had been any breaches of conduct,\" retorted the officer with some asperity.  \"One midshipman, sir, after having been instructed to touch nothing, rested his hand on one of the brass rods.\"  \"His name?\"  \"I don't know the names of many of the young gentlemen yet, sir, so I don't know the particular midshipman's name, sir.\"  \"Then point him out to me,\" insisted the officer.  There was hardly any need to do so. Pennington's face, flushed with mortification, was sufficient identification. But the chief electrician stepped over, halting in front of the hapless one, and said:  \"This is the young gentleman, sir.\"  \"Your name, sir?\" demanded the officer.  \"Pennington, sir.\"  \"Mr. Pennington, you will place yourself on the report, sir, for disobedience of orders,\" commanded the officer. \"Is this the only case, Whittam?\"  \"The only case, sir.\"  The officer passed out of the dynamo room, leaving the unlucky one more than ever angry with Darrin, whom he incorrectly charged with his present trouble.  The recall sounding, Dave turned to Whittam, saying crisply but pleasantly:  \"Thank you for our instruction.\"  \"He's thanking the fellow for my new scrape,\" growled Pennington inwardly.  Dave marched his section back to deck and dismissed it. Dan Dalzell, as section leader in steam instruction, immediately re-formed it.  \"You will report in the engine-room, Mr. Dalzell, to Lieutenant-Commander Forman, who is chief engineer of this ship. He will assign you to an instructor.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" Dan replied, saluting. \"Section, right wheel--march!\"  Dan already knew where, down in the bowels of the great battleship, to find the engine room.  Reaching that department, Dan halted his section.  \"Section all present, sir,\" reported Dan, saluting a strange officer, who, however, wore the insignia of a lieutenant-commander.  \"Your name, sir?\" inquired the officer.  \"Dalzell, sir.\"  \"Let your section break ranks. Then you may all follow me, and keep your eyes open, for you will go through one or two dark places.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir. Section break ranks.\"  Lieutenant-Commander Forman led the way, with all the members of the section wondering what was to be the nature of their first day's work in the engineer department.  Descending lower into the ship, the chief engineer led the young middies over a grating, and paused at the head of an iron ladder.  \"Pass down in orderly fashion, single file,\" directed the chief engineer, halting. \"When at the foot of this ladder, cross a grating to port side, and then descend a second ladder, which you will find.\"  All the midshipmen went down the first ladder in silence. Dan,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10045"],["title","Dave Darrin's Second Year at Annapolis (#4)"],["body","had preceded the others, crossed the grating and found the second ladder.  Once more these youngsters descended. Pennington, as though by mere accident, succeeded in following Dave Darrin down the ladder.  Just as they were near the bottom Dave felt a foot descend upon his shoulder, almost with a kick, and then rest there with a crushing pressure.  It hurt keenly until Darrin was able to dodge out from under and hurriedly reach the bottom.  \"Pardon, whoever you are,\" came a gruff voice.  Dave, with his shoulder crippled a good deal, and paining keenly, halted as soon as his foot had touched bottom. It was dark down there, though some reflected light came from an incandescent light at a distance.  Dave waited, to peer into the face of the man who had stepped on his shoulder.  It was Pennington, of course!  \"I'll take pains not to go down ahead of you again, or to follow you up a ladder,\" grunted Darrin suspiciously.  \"Oh, are you the man on whose shoulder my foot rested?\" asked Pennington, with apparent curiosity.  \"Didn't you know it!\" questioned Darrin, looking straight into the other's eyes.  Instead of answering intelligibly, Pennington turned and walked away a few feet.  \"Perhaps that fellow thinks he's going to vent his spite on me in a lot of petty ways,\" murmured Dave. \"If that is the idea he has in his head, he's going to wake up one of these days!\"  Following the last midshipman came Lieutenant-Commander Forman.  \"After me, gentlemen,\" directed the chief engineer. He turned down a narrow passage, only a few feet long, and came out in the furnace room.  Here huge fires glowed through the furnace doors. Four of the Navy's firemen stood resting on their shovels. Instantly, on perceiving the chief engineer, however, the men stood at attention.  \"Pass the word for the chief water tender,\" ordered the engineer, turning to one of the firemen.  The messenger soon came back with a pleasant-faced, stalwart man of forty.  \"Heistand,\" ordered the chief engineer, \"give these members of the first section, third: class, steam instruction, a thorough drill in firing.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied the chief water tender, saluting.  \"Heistand's orders are mine, Mr. Dalzell,\" continued the lieutenant-commander, facing Dan. \"Preserve order in your section.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Dan, saluting. Acknowledging this courtesy in kind, the chief engineer turned and left the furnace room.  Heistand was presumably of German parentage, though he had no accent. He struck the midshipmen as being a pleasant, wholesome fellow, though the water tenders and firemen of the \"Massachusetts\" knew that he could be extremely strict and grim at need.  \"You will now, young gentlemen,\" began Heistand, \"proceed to learn all about priming a furnace, lighting, building, cleaning and generally taking care of a fire. Two furnaces have been left idle for this instruction.\"  But two of the regular firemen now remained in the room. These were ordered to hustle out coal before boilers B and D. Then Heistand taught the members of the section how to swing a shovel to the best advantage so as to get in a maximum of coal with the least effort. He also illustrated two or three incorrect ways of shoveling coal.  \"The idea of making coal heavers out of us!\" growled a much-disgusted voice.  Dan did not see who the speaker was, but his eyes flashed as he turned and rasped out:  \"Silence in the section! Speak only to ask for information, and then at the proper time.\"  \"Another young autocrat!\" muttered a voice.  \"Wait one moment, please, Heistand,\" begged Dan. Then, wheeling squarely about, and facing all the members of the section, he declared with emphasis:  \"If there's any more unauthorized talking I shall feel obliged to pass the word above that discipline is in a bad way in this section.\"  Then he wheeled about once more, facing the chief water tender.  \"Now, young gentlemen,\" resumed the chief water tender, \"take your shovels and fill in lively under boilers B and D.\"  Three or four times Heistand checked one or another of the midshipmen, to show him a more correct way of handling the shovel. Yet, in good time, both furnaces were primed.  \"Now, Mr. Dalzell, please detail four members of the section to follow me with their shovels and bring red coals from under another boiler.\"  Dan appointed himself, Darrin, Farley and Pennington.  Burning coals were brought and thrown into each furnace, and in a little while roaring fires were going. These, though not needed for the handling of the battleship, were permitted to burn for a while, Heistand explaining to the section practically the uses of the water gauges and the test cocks. By this time the midshipmen's white working clothes were liberally sprinkled with coal dust and somewhat smeared with oils.  \"And now, young gentlemen, as we have no further use for these fires, you will next learn how to haul them,\" announced Heistand.  This was interesting work, but hot and fast. The implements with which the middies worked soon became red-hot at the end. Yet, as all entered into this novel work with zest, the fires had soon been hauled out on to the floor plates.  Just as the last of this work was being done Pennington, as an apparent accident due to excess of zeal, dropped the red-hot end of his implement across the toe of Darrin's left shoe.  In an instant the leather began to blaze. With swift presence of mind Dave stepped his right foot on the flame, smothering it at once.  But he was \"mad clean through.\"  \"See here, Pen,\" he muttered, in a low voice, his eyes blazing fiercely into the other midshipman's, \"that is the last piece of impudence that will be tolerated from you.\"  Midshipman Pennington's lip curled disdainfully.  Dan had not seen the \"accident,\" but he was near enough to hear the talking, and he caught Dave at it. So Dan ordered, impartially:  \"Mr. Darrin, you will place yourself on report for unauthorized talking in section!\"  Dave flushed still more hotly, but said nothing.  Midshipman Dalzell now marched the section from the furnace room, and dismissed it. It was near noon, and would soon be time for the middies to eat.  Dave hurried away, washed, changed his uniform, and then stepped away swiftly to place himself on the report.  \"I was sorry to do that, old chum,\" murmured Dan, as he met Dave returning. \"But of course I couldn't play favorites. What made you so far forget yourself?\"  \"A something that would have had the same effect on you,\" retorted Dave grimly. Thereupon he described Pennington's two underhanded assaults that morning.  \"Humph!\" muttered Dalzell. \"That fellow Pen is bound to go the whole limit with you.\"  \"He won't go much further,\" declared Dave, his eyes flashing.  \"And the chump ought to know it, too,\" mused Dan. \"The class history of the last year should have taught him that. But see here, Dave, I don't believe Pen will do anything openly. He will construct a series of plausible accidents.\"  \"There will be one thing about him that will be open, if he goes any further,\" retorted Dave, \"and that will be his face when he collides with my fist.\"  \"I hope I see that when it happens,\" grinned Dalzell. \"It's bound to be entertaining!\"  \"Wait a second, then. Here comes Pennington now,\" murmured Dave Darrin in an undertone.  Pennington, in his immaculate blue uniform, like the chums, came strolling along the passageway between decks.  He affected not to see the chums, and would have passed by. But Dave, eyeing him closely, waited until Pen was barely three feet away. Then Darrin said tersely:  \"Mr. Pennington, I wish an understanding with you.\"  \"I don't want any with you,\" replied Pennington insolently, as he stared at Dave from under much-raised eyebrows. He would have gone by, but Dave sprang squarely in front of him.  \"Just wait a moment!\" warned Dave rather imperiously, for he was aglow with justifiable indignation.  \"Well?\" demanded Pennington halting. \"Out with it, whatever you may think you have to say.\"  \"I have two things to speak about,\" replied Dave, trying to control his voice. \"In the first place, while going down the ladders to the furnaces this morning, you stepped on my shoulder.\"  \"Well!\" insisted Pennington coldly.  \"The second thing you did was, when hauling the fires, to drop red-hot metal across one of my shoes, setting it on fire.\"  \"Well?\" insisted Pennington more coldly.  \"If you mean to contend that either one was an accident,\" resumed Dave, \"then--\"  But he found himself obliged to pause for a moment in order to steady his voice.  \"Well?\" asked Pennington with more insolence than ever.  \"If you make such pretense in either case,\" tittered Dave Darrin, \"then you're a liar!\"  \"Fellow!\" sputtered Pennington, turning white with anger.  \"I mean what I say, and I can back it up,\" muttered Darrin.  \"Then I'll make you eat your words!\" roared Pennington.  Clenching his fists and with the boxer's attitude, Pen aimed two swift blows at Darrin.  Neither blow reached, however, for Dave dodged out of the way. Then Darrin struck back, a straight, true, forceful blow that landed on the other midshipman's nose, knocking him down.  Pennington staggered somewhat when he rose, but he was quickly up, none the less, and ready for anything that might happen.  All of a sudden Dan Dalzell felt his own heart going down into his shoes. One of the ship's officers had just entered the passageway, in time to see what was going on.     CHAPTER IV   A LITTLE MEETING ASHORE  \"Stop it, both of you,\" whispered Dan.  \"Stand at attention, ready to salute the officer.\"  Pennington, with the blood flowing from his damaged nose, would have made a most ludicrous figure saluting!  The instant that he saw such evidence as Pen's nose presented the officer would be bound to make inquiries.  Then, just as surely, his next step must be to Border the three before the commandant of midshipmen.  Fighting carries with it a severe penalty. Even Dan was certain to be reported, through the mere fact of his"]]]
