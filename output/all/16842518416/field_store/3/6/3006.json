Nothing has since occurred to change my view in this regard, and I recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of neutrality, by which process the so-called recognition of belligerents is published, could of itself and unattended by other action accomplish nothing toward the one end for which we labor--the instant pacification of Cuba and the cessation of the misery that afflicts the island.  Turning to the question of recognizing at this time the independence of the present insurgent government in Cuba, we find safe precedents in our history from an early day. They are well summed up in President Jackson's message to Congress, December 21, 1836, on the subject of the recognition of the independence of Texas. He said:    In all the contests that have arisen out of the revolutions of France,   out of the disputes relating to the crowns of Portugal and Spain, out   of the revolutionary movements of those Kingdoms, out of the separation   of the American possessions of both from the European Governments, and   out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in   Spanish America, so wisely consistent with our just principles has been   the action of our Government that we have under the most critical   circumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil than   that produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against   whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide.    It has thus been made known to the world that the uniform policy and   practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes   which merely relate to the internal government of other nations, and   eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party, without   reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the   original controversy.           *       *       *       *       *    * * * But on this as on every trying occasion safety is to be found in   a rigid adherence to principle.    In the contest between Spain and her revolted colonies we stood aloof   and waited, not only until the ability of the new States to protect   themselves was fully established, but until the danger of their being   again subjugated had entirely passed away. Then, and not till then, were   they recognized. Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself. * * *   It is true that, with regard to Texas, the civil authority of Mexico has   been expelled, its invading army defeated, the chief of the Republic   himself captured, and all present power to control the newly organized   Government of Texas annihilated within its confines. But, on the other   hand, there is, in appearance at least, an immense disparity of physical   force on the side of Mexico. The Mexican Republic under another   Executive is rallying its forces under a new leader and menacing a fresh   invasion to recover its lost dominion.    Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas   may be considered as suspended, and were there nothing peculiar in the   relative situation of the United States and Texas our acknowledgment   of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as   consistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore   held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions.   Thereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded to consider the risk that there might be imputed to the United States motives of selfish interest in view of the former claim on our part to the territory of Texas and of the avowed purpose of the Texans in seeking recognition of independence as an incident to the incorporation of Texas in the Union, concluding thus:  Prudence, therefore, seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude, if not until Mexico itself or one of the great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new Government, at least until the lapse of time or the course of events shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the Government constituted by them. Neither of the contending parties can justly complain of this course. By pursuing it we are but carrying out the long-established policy of our Government--a policy which has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence at home.  These are the words of the resolute and patriotic Jackson. They are evidence that the United States, in addition to the test imposed by public law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a neutral state (to wit, that the revolted state shall \"constitute in fact a body politic, having a government in substance as well as in name, possessed of the elements of stability,\" and forming _de facto_, \"if left to itself, a state among the nations, reasonably capable of discharging the duties of a state\"), has imposed for its own governance in dealing with cases like these the further condition that recognition of independent statehood is not due to a revolted dependency until the danger of its being again subjugated by the parent state has entirely passed away.  This extreme test was, in fact, applied in the case of Texas. The Congress to whom President Jackson referred the question as one \"probably leading to war,\" and therefore a proper subject for \"a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declared and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must be furnished,\" left the matter of the recognition of Texas to the discretion of the Executive, providing merely for the sending of a diplomatic agent when the President should be satisfied that the Republic of Texas had become \"an independent state.\" It was so recognized by President Van Buren, who commissioned a charg√© d'affaires March 7, 1837, after Mexico had abandoned an attempt to reconquer the Texan territory, and when there was at the time no _bona fide_ contest going on between the insurgent province and its former sovereign.  I said in my message of December last:    It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection   possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which alone   can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor.   The same requirement must certainly be no less seriously considered when the graver issue of recognizing independence is in question, for no less positive test can be applied to the greater act than to the lesser, while, on the other hand, the influences and consequences of the struggle upon the internal policy of the recognizing state, which form important factors when the recognition of belligerency is concerned, are secondary, if not rightly eliminable, factors when the real question is whether the community claiming recognition is or is not independent beyond peradventure.  Nor from the standpoint of expediency do I think it would be wise or prudent for this Government to recognize at the present time the independence of the so-called Cuban Republic. Such recognition is not necessary in order to enable the United States to intervene and pacify the island. To commit this country now to the recognition of any particular government in Cuba might subject us to embarrassing conditions of international obligation toward the organization so recognized. In case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the approval or disapproval of such government. We would be required to submit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a friendly ally.  When it shall appear hereafter that there is within the island a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation, and having as a matter of fact the proper forms and attributes of nationality, such government can be promptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of the United States with such nation adjusted.  There remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war, either as an impartial neutral, by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants, or as the active ally of the one party or the other.  As to the first, it is not to be forgotten that during the last few months the relation of the United States has virtually been one of friendly intervention in many ways, each not of itself conclusive, but all tending to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate pacific result, just and honorable to all interests concerned. The spirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest, unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba, untarnished by differences between us and Spain and unstained by the blood of American citizens.  The forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war, according to the large dictates of humanity and following many historical precedents where neighboring states have interfered to check the hopeless sacrifices of life by internecine conflicts beyond their borders, is justifiable on rational grounds. It involves, however, hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest, as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.  The grounds for such intervention may be briefly summarized as follows:  First. In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there, and which the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate. It is no answer to say this is all in another country, belonging to another nation, and is therefore none of our business. It is specially our duty, for it is right at our door.  Second. We owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection and indemnity for life and property which no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],["title","Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#7)"],["body","there can or will afford, and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection.  Third. The right to intervene may be justified by the very serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people and by the wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island.  Fourth, and which is of the utmost importance. The present condition of affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace and entails upon this Government an enormous expense. With such a conflict waged for years in an island so near us and with which our people have such trade and business relations; when the lives and liberty of our citizens are in constant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined; where our trading vessels are liable to seizure and are seized at our very door by war ships of a foreign nation; the expeditions of filibustering that we are powerless to prevent altogether, and the irritating questions and entanglements thus arising--all these and others that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations, are a constant menace to our peace and compel us to keep on a semi war footing with a nation with which we are at peace.  These elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been strikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly moved the American people. I have already transmitted to Congress the report of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle ship _Maine_ in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th of February.[6] The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the national heart with inexpressible horror. Two hundred and fifty-eight brave sailors and marines and two officers of our Navy, reposing in the fancied security of a friendly harbor, have been hurled to death, grief and want brought to their homes and sorrow to the nation.  The naval court of inquiry, which, it is needless to say, commands the unqualified confidence of the Government, was unanimous in its conclusion that the destruction of the _Maine_ was caused by an exterior explosion--that of a submarine mine. It did not assume to place the responsibility. That remains to be fixed.  In any event, the destruction of the _Maine_, by whatever exterior cause, is a patent and impressive proof of a state of things in Cuba that is intolerable. That condition is thus shown to be such that the Spanish Government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the American Navy in the harbor of Havana on a mission of peace, and rightfully there.  Further referring in this connection to recent diplomatic correspondence, a dispatch from our minister to Spain of the 26th ultimo contained the statement that the Spanish minister for foreign affairs assured him positively that Spain will do all that the highest honor and justice require in the matter of the _Maine_. The reply above referred to, of the 31st ultimo, also contained an expression of the readiness of Spain to submit to an arbitration all the differences which can arise in this matter, which is subsequently explained by the note of the Spanish minister at Washington of the 10th instant, as follows:    As to the question of fact which springs from the diversity of views   between the reports of the American and Spanish boards, Spain proposes   that the facts be ascertained by an impartial investigation by experts,   whose decision Spain accepts in advance.   To this I have made no reply.  President Grant, in 1875, after discussing the phases of the contest as it then appeared and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation, said:    In such event I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to   assume the responsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously   consider the only remaining measures possible--mediation and   intervention. Owing, perhaps, to the large expanse of water separating   the island from the peninsula, * * * the contending parties appear to   have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest   wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume the   part of peacemaker. In this view in the earlier days of the contest the   good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good   faith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and in   sincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined by   Spain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they   would be indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the   opinion of Spain that time has been reached. And yet the strife   continues, with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the   interests of the United States and of other nations. Each party seems   quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other, as well   as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of   peace in the island; but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment,   and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party   shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other.   Under these circumstances the agency of others, either by mediation or   by intervention, seems to be the only alternative which must, sooner or   later, be invoked for the termination of the strife.   In the last annual message of my immediate predecessor, during the pending struggle, it was said:    When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection   has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is   extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a   hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife   which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and   the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a   situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty   of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly   hesitate to recognize and discharge.   In my annual message to Congress December last, speaking to this question, I said:    The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of   a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as   equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare   of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and   other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that   time conies, that action will be determined in the line of indisputable   right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in   the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to the   people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and   honor, and to humanity.    Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated   only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion   nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over   the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of   its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall   be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty   imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity   to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only   because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command   the support and approval of the civilized world.   The long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give us the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.  In view of these facts and of these considerations I ask the Congress to authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between the Government of Spain and the people of Cuba, and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these purposes.  And in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserving the lives of the starving people of the island I recommend that the distribution of food and supplies be continued and that an appropriation be made out of the public Treasury to supplement the charity of our citizens.  The issue is now with the Congress. It is a solemn responsibility. I have exhausted every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of affairs which is at our doors. Prepared to execute every obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution and the law, I await your action.  Yesterday, and since the preparation of the foregoing message, official information was received by me that the latest decree of the Queen Regent of Spain directs General Blanco, in order to prepare and facilitate peace, to proclaim a suspension of hostilities, the duration and details of which have not yet been communicated to me.  This fact, with every other pertinent consideration, will, I am sure, have your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberations upon which you are about to enter. If this measure attains a successful result, then our aspirations as a Christian, peace-loving people will be realized. If it fails, it will be only another justification for our contemplated action.  WILLIAM McKINLEY.  [Footnote 4: See pp. 127-136.]  [Footnote 5: See p. 136.]  [Footnote 6: See pp. 136-139.]"]]]
