At last the moment arrived, and silently and cautiously they crept from under the covers, and once the Villain stumbled in climbing over the side of the crib, which wakened the little boy, but he must have been very tired for he went to sleep at once without thinking of his dolls.  They hurried away in the direction of the water, which Jackie Tar said he knew, for, said he, \"A sailor can always smell the salt sea air, no matter how far away he may be.\"  And sure enough, in a few moments they arrived at the water's edge.  \"Now that we are here,\" said Kernel Cob, \"what's to be done?\"  \"All in good time, Kernel,\" said Jackie Tar, \"Each man to his trade,\" and he began to look about.  \"Gather all the sticks you see and bring them to me,\" said he, and they brought him pieces of wood, large and small, and he chose the largest, and having torn the lining of his jacket into strips, he spliced them into a rope and with this he tied the wood together until he had made a very good raft indeed.  And he set the biggest stick of all, which was a bamboo pole, into the raft and tying his jacket with one sleeve at the top, and the other at the bottom of the pole, he had a good sail made in a jiffy.  \"All aboard,\" he sang out and they got upon the raft and sat \"forward,\" as he told them, and grasping the tail of his coat in one hand, and the rudder with the other, for he had tied a flat board at the stern of the raft, they set sail.  \"Where away?\" he asked.  \"I don't care,\" said Kernel Cob, \"as long as we get away from this China place, for I don't like any place that isn't what it says it is.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Jackie Tar. \"If you take my advice, we'll steer for India.\"  \"Why?\" asked the Villain.  \"Because,\" said Jackie Tar, \"from India there is always a ship bound for England and, once in England, we can easily get a ship for America.\"  \"Goodie!\" said Sweetclover.  And so Jackie Tar steered the raft in the direction of India, and they sailed with a good wind.  \"I thought you said it was the thirteenth of the month?\" said the Villain.  \"I must have made a mistake,\" said Jackie Tar, \"for I never had a better ship in all the years I've sailed the seas.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]                     SAILORS          When I am grown to be a man         I'll be a sailor if I can;         For sailors, everywhere they roam         Are sure to find a welcome home.          They sail upon the many seas         We learn of in Geographies,         And steer their ship by sun and star         From Vera Cruz to Zanzibar.          They visit Chili and Japan,         And Guyaquil and Yucatan,         And they have friends in Martinique         And relatives in Mozambique.          And all about the world they sail         In wind and storm and mighty gale,         So they can tell the tales they do         That children love to listen to.          And so when I am grown a man         I'll be a sailor, if I can,         And sail upon the many seas         We learn of in Geographies.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XV   And under the skillful command of Jackie Tar, they reached India.  \"We'd better land at night,\" said Jackie Tar, \"so we won't be bothered with a lot of people watching us.\"  So they waited until it was dark.  \"I've been thinking,\" said Jackie Tar. \"Once when I was here before, I saw some magicians who did wonderful tricks. They are called Hindus. A Hindu is an Indian.\"  \"Oh, I know,\" said Kernel Cob, \"he's got red skin and wears feathers in his hair.\"  \"No!\" said Jackie Tar. \"That's an American Indian; but these Hindus are born in India where we are now.\"  \"Tell us about the tricks,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Well,\" said Jackie Tar, \"there isn't a trick which they can't do. Once I saw them make a little boy run up a long pole and when he came to the top he disappeared.\"  \"You mean to say they can do that?\" asked the Villain.  \"They sure can,\" answered Jackie Tar. \"And my idea is this: If they can do that, maybe they can show you where Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather are.\"  \"What makes you so smart, Jackie Tar?\" asked the Villain.  \"I don't know,\" said he, \"I guess I was just born that way.\"  \"Well, let's go ashore and ask one of them to help us,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"Aye, aye, mates,\" said Jackie Tar.  So they went ashore, and walked along the streets until they came to a little house that Jackie Tar said he remembered as being the house where a magician lived.  And they knocked upon the door and it opened. And they went inside and all was quiet and black as night. And they groped their way till they heard a low mumbling sound, and, pulling aside a curtain, they saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting in a room with black furniture and curtains.  And he said something to them in a very strange language which they couldn't understand.  And Jackie Tar stepped forward and said:  \"Please, kind magician, we have come to find the motheranfather of Jackie and Peggs. Will you be good enough to help us?\" And even as he was speaking a great cloud spread through the room and floated toward the ceiling. In a minute the cloud became thinner, so you could see through it, and at once trees and a house were seen.  \"It's Jackie and Peggs' garden,\" said Sweetclover in a breathless whisper. \"Look!\"  And sure enough there was the garden just as they left it, and Jackie and Peggs were playing with Kernel Cob and Sweetclover just as they did on that day they were blown away by the storm.  \"It's us! It's us!\" cried Sweetclover, and as she spoke Peggs came and put the parasol over them and the storm arose that carried them away toward the sky. Then the cloud disappeared, and the vision was gone.  \"It's the strangest thing I ever saw,\" and Kernel Cob rubbed his eyes and pinched himself, but he had to admit that he had not been asleep and dreamed it.  [Illustration]  And the Magician led them into another room through a black curtain, and this new room was blacker than the first one, and they held hands so they wouldn't become separated.  In the middle of the room was a great crystal globe which stood upon a low table, and the Magician went to it, and, waving his hand above it, said something which sounded like \"Alla ballaboo.\" And at once the globe began to glow as though there were a fire inside of it.  Then the light began to fade until the globe looked like a ball of milk.  Again the Magician waved his hand above it and a picture began to show itself upon its surface, like when you develop a photograph plate in a dark room.  First the trees, and then a little hut and snow, lots and lots of snow, and then a man with a shovel and a pick on his shoulder, and then a woman and they were roughly dressed.  And the man in the picture began to pick the ground, and the woman took the shovel, and they worked and worked. Presently, the man stooped down and picked up what seemed to be a stone, and he showed it eagerly to the woman and she trembled with excitement and the stone glowed.  \"It must be gold,\" said Jackie Tar.  \"They're gold miners.\"  \"But who are they?\"  \"I've got it!\" cried Kernel Cob. \"They're Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" and he danced with joy.  But in his excitement he made a great mistake, for in hopping about he bumped into the crystal ball, and knocked it from the little table on which it stood.  The Magician rushed to save the globe from falling, but he was too late.  It came to the floor and crashed into a thousand pieces.  When he saw what was done and who had done it, he turned on Kernel Cob, and it was with great difficulty that Kernel Cob got out of his way.  Out into the street ran Kernel Cob, followed by Sweetclover, the Villain and Jackie Tar, the Magician in hot pursuit, and only that he was a very old man he would have caught them.  But he didn't, thank goodness! and at last they arrived at the raft.  \"Well,\" said Jackie Tar, when they were safely seated, \"one thing we know, anyway, and that is that Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather are living somewhere in the snow, and if it hadn't been for Kernel Cob....\"  But he didn't finish what he was going to say, for, looking at Kernel Cob, he discovered him doing something that he had never done before--CRYING!  Sweetclover ran to him.  \"Oh, Kernel Cob!\" she cried, \"what is it. Are you hurt?\"  \"Oh,\" he sobbed, \"if it weren't for me, maybe we would have found out all about Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather, and maybe the Magician would have showed us how to get there,\" and he cried as if his heart would break.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XVI   And they sat upon the raft and talked it all over, what was to be done, and how they were to do it.  \"Well,\" said Jackie Tar, \"the nearest gold mines to us are in Africa.\"  \"Have they got snow around them?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"Why, no, that's so,\" said Jackie Tar.  \"Where else?\" asked the Villain.  \"We can go down to the South Pole,\" said Jackie Tar. At which Kernel Cob began to laugh.  \"You don't expect to find any snow at the South Pole, do you?\" he asked.  \"Why not?\" said Jackie Tar.  \"It'll be too hot,\" answered Kernel Cob.  And it took about half an hour to explain to him how it got colder the farther south you went, after you crossed the equator.  So they set sail for the South Pole.  And after they had sailed for a couple of days and nights, there suddenly arose a great hurricane.  The wind raged and their tiny raft was blown clear out of the water.  \"I hope I may never have to go to sea again,\" said the Villain. \"And I wouldn't much care, if I fell into the water and were drowned.\"  But he clung to the mast just the same, for everybody loves to live no matter how miserable they may be, because they always hope that things will be better.  Soon a bit of land was seen, and you may be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14110"],["title","Kernel Cob And Little Miss Sweetclover (#7)"],["body","that when they saw that there was a great shout of joy, especially from the Villain.  Toward this they steered and in a little while Jackie Tar, who had been watching very closely, cried out that it was Venice.  And they sailed toward Venice, which, as you know, is a city in Italy, and is built on a number of little islands and the streets are nearly all of water.  \"I think it is silly to go on,\" said Sweetclover, \"for we know that Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather are not here, but somewhere in the mines.\"  \"That's so,\" said Kernel Cob, \"Let's turn 'round and sail for the South Pole again.\"  \"Please don't,\" said the Villain, \"I couldn't stand it. Isn't there some way that we can get to the South Pole by walking?\"  \"Not that I know of,\" said Jackie Tar, \"unless you were a crab and crawled along the bottom of the ocean.\"  \"Very well,\" said the Villain. \"I'll try not to complain.\"  \"Cheer up,\" said Kernel Cob, \"all our troubles are over,\" and so he thought, for the sea wasn't any rougher than the water in a bath tub.  But often when you think there isn't anything going to happen, that's just the time when it does.  You see the raft had been blown about a great deal, so it wasn't very strange that the pieces of wood had come apart here and there.  The first they knew of their danger, the piece of wood that Sweetclover had been sitting on broke loose from the rest of the raft and began to float away and Kernel Cob jumped into the water to save her.  He caught the piece of wood with so much strength that he toppled Sweetclover over into the water, and then he lost his head, I mean not really his head, you know, but only that he got excited and let go of the stick.  The Villain, who couldn't swim at all, jumped in after them and all he did was to make matters worse.  Jackie Tar tried to tell them what to do, but they were too startled to pay any attention to him. So in he plunged and swam to them, for he was a very good swimmer.  When he reached them they were all floundering about, so he dived down and came up in the midst of them.  \"Put your hands gently on my shoulders,\" he ordered, \"and don't weigh down or you will push me under.\"  And when they had done this he looked about, but the raft was nowhere to be seen except for a few pieces of wood drifting about.  They were about a mile from shore, which is a pretty good swim for one man alone, but here he was with three others who couldn't swim one stroke.  But Jackie Tar was a brave sailor. Besides, he thought, \"Here is a chance for me to show Kernel Cob that he is not the only brave person in the world.\"  \"Pull off your coat,\" he shouted to the Villain, and the Villain pulled it off.  \"Now tie one of the sleeves about my foot,\" he cried, and it was done. \"Now each of you catch hold of the jacket and hang on for dear life and I'll see if I can pull you to shore.\"  So he started swimming, and little by little he neared the land, swimming with a strong stroke until he brought them safely to the beach.  You may think he was tired, but not so, for when they got up on their feet, and walked ashore, he simply knocked his heels together and danced a hornpipe and sang:  \"A sailor's life's the life for me.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XVII   And they sat upon the shore until Jackie Tar had finished his song about the Sailor's Life, and by that time their clothing was pretty well dried out from their swim, so they got up and wandered toward the city and it wasn't an easy thing to do, for they had a lot of bridges to cross and they had no boat.  \"I think the best thing to do,\" said the Villain, \"is to find a toy-store, for there some doll can tell us what to do.\"  So they kept an eye out for a toy-store, and pretty soon they found one.  \"I'd better go in alone,\" said Kernel Cob, \"because I'm the bravest and have a sword and can fight if any trouble arises.\"  \"Aye, aye, skipper,\" said Jackie Tar.  So Kernel Cob crept very carefully into the shop and very lucky he did so, for the shopkeeper was there although he was asleep.  On a shelf stood a row of soldiers.  And Kernel Cob saluted them and said, \"I am Kernel Cob of the United States Army,\" at which the soldiers gave him three cheers.  \"My friends and I,\" said Kernel Cob, \"are looking for the South Pole, where we hope to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather, and I thought maybe you could help us.\"  But not one of them answered him for they didn't know what he had said.  \"I guess tin soldiers are deaf,\" said he.  \"No, they're not,\" said a voice behind him, \"only these are Italians and do not understand English.\"  And looking behind him, Kernel Cob discovered an English clown doll who turned a somersault and came up on his feet with a merry laugh.  \"Good for you,\" said Kernel Cob, \"I wish I could do that.\"  \"Everybody to his trade,\" said the clown, and stood upon his head.  \"Maybe you'd be good enough to stay upon your feet till I find out what I want to know,\" said Kernel Cob.  And the Clown sprang into the air, turned over three or four times, and landed neatly upon his feet again.  \"What is it you want to know?\" he asked.  \"First I want to know why you don't keep still?\" asked Kernel Cob, for the Clown's antics made him nervous.  \"I'm a Circus Clown,\" said he, \"and I just turn these hand-springs all day.\"  So Kernel Cob looked about the store, but could see nobody else that looked as if he could talk English.  \"What do you do all day without anybody to talk to?\" he asked the Clown at length.  \"Oh,\" said the Clown, \"I tell myself funny stories to make me laugh, and then I have my hand-springs to make; that keeps me pretty busy,\" and he rolled along the shelf, head over heels.  \"Well, I always thought a Clown was a silly fellow,\" said Kernel Cob, \"but now I'm sure of it,\" and he turned upon his heel and walked out of the store.  When he got outside he told the others that it was no use trying to find out anything that way. So they walked along till night came and they crawled into a boat, which is called a gondola, and wait to sleep.  During the night, they were wakened by the movement of the boat, and looking out they saw that they were in motion. A man in a white suit and a red sash was paddling the gondola with a long oar, and he was singing a very beautiful song, and the moonlight was on the water. And they passed many other gondolas, and all the men who paddled were singing beautiful songs.  \"I would like to live here,\" whispered the Villain, \"everybody seems to be so happy.\"  \"So would I,\" said Sweetclover. \"I love to hear beautiful music, but we have to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather.\"  And being tired, they fell asleep and early in the morning their gondola was resting at the side of some marble steps which led up to a great square called Saint Mark's. So they got out of the gondola and walked across the square, for there wasn't anybody to be seen at so early an hour in the morning.  And a great number of pigeons were flying about. Thousands and thousands of them.  And Jackie Tar had a wonderful idea.  \"Let's ask the pigeons if they will help us.\"  \"Goodie!\" said Sweetclover.  So they went up to a group of pigeons which were strutting along the ground, picking grain which the people throw to them in the day time.  \"Hello! hello!\" said Jackie Tar, and in a minute about a hundred pigeons gathered about them. And he said he wanted some of them to help him get to the South Pole.  \"I'll do it,\" said one of them, and he stepped up to Jackie Tar.  \"Good for you, matey,\" said Jackie Tar.  \"I've always wanted to travel,\" said the pigeon, \"for I'm tired flying around here and I'd like to see the world.\"  \"So would I,\" said another.  \"And I.\"  [Illustration]  \"And I.\" \"And I,\" cried three or four more.  You see pigeons are like people, for, lots of times, people want to do things but they wait and wait and wait till some one starts it.  \"Four are all we need,\" said Jackie Tar, \"one for each of us.\" So the pigeons crowded about and begged and begged to be taken, and Kernel Cob and Sweetclover and the Villain and Jackie Tar chose the biggest and strongest, and the ones that they liked the color of the best.  But one of the pigeons didn't want to go to the South Pole, for, said she, \"You don't hear as much of the South Pole as you do of the North Pole, and unless you go to the North Pole, I won't go.\"  So it was decided to go to the North Pole, \"For,\" said Kernel Cob, \"I don't think it makes any difference after all. The Magician didn't say which pole it was, so maybe it's just as well.\"  \"I say let's go to the North Pole,\" said Jackie Tar, \"and, if we don't find them there, we can very easily try the South Pole next.\"  \"Yes,\" said Kernel Cob, \"let's go to all the Poles there are until we find the right one.\"  So they got upon the pigeons' backs, just as a little boy or girl gets on a pony, and one of the pigeons, the one that Sweetclover was on, said to the others:  \"Let's make a race of it for the first mile.\"  \"Good!\" squeaked the others, and off they flew at their top speed.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XVIII   It was a most exciting race, for they were pretty evenly matched in strength and speed, but one of them did win the race, and you will be very glad to know that it was the one on which Sweetclover was riding.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted the Villain, for he was better pleased that she had won than if he had won himself.  And they flew all day over Italy and, looking down, they saw people working in the fields and the vineyards, growing rice and grapes and all the fruits that come from Italy, and always they heard the people singing beautiful songs of gladness.  \"I wonder what makes them so happy?\" said the Villain.  \"It's because it's such a beautiful country, I guess,\" said Sweetclover.  And they flew over the lakes which lie between Italy and Switzerland, and on all sides were mountains, the tops of which are always covered with snow.  Soon they came to Switzerland, which is away up in the mountains"]]]
