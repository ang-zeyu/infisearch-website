I never eat supper.\"       \"By George! I am so hungry I can't talk.\"       _Fair Hostess_ (on hospitable thoughts intent). \"Oh, I'm so glad!\"  \"Things one would rather have left unsaid\":       _Amiable Hostess_. \"What! must you go already? Really, Professor,      it's too bad of this sweet young wife of yours to carry you off so      early! She always does!\"       _Professor_. \"No, no, not _always_, Mrs. Bright. At _most_ houses I      positively have to drag her away!\"  \"Truths that might have been left unspoken\":       _Hostess_. \"What? haven't you brought your sisters, Mr. Jones?\"       _Mr. Jones_. \"No, they couldn't come, Mrs. Smith. The fact is,      they're saving themselves for Mrs. Brown's Dance to-morrow, you      know!\" (_January_ 9, 1886).  Under the heading \"Feline Amenities\":       _Fair Hostess_ (to Mrs. Masham, who is looking her very best).      \"How-dy-do, dear? I hope you're not so tired as you look!\"       _Sympathetic Lady Guest_. \"Don't be unhappy about the rain, dear      Mrs. Bounderson--it will soon be over, and your garden will be      lovelier than ever.\"       _Little Mrs. Goldmore Bounderson_ (who is giving her first Garden      Party). \"Yes; but I'm afraid it will keep my most desirable guests      from coming!\"  This last duologue is pure du Maurier. It is subtle.  \"Feline Amenities\" again:       \"How kind of you to call--I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!\"       \"Oh, don't mention it.--I've not been at all bored! I've been      trying to imagine what I should do to make this room look      comfortable if it were mine!\" (_November_ 22, 1892).  The \"Things one would rather have expressed otherwise\" is a good series too:       _The Professor_ (to Hostess). \"Thank you so much for a most      delightful evening! I shall indeed go to bed with pleasant      recollections--and _you_ will be the very _last_ person I shall      think of!\"  And again, of the same series:       _Fair Hostess_. \"Good-night, Major Jones. We're supposed to      breakfast at nine, but we're not very punctual people. Indeed the      later you appear to-morrow morning, the better pleased we shall all      be\" (_May_ 13, 1893).  \"Things one would rather have left unsaid\":       _He_. \"Yes, I know Bootle slightly, and confess I don't think much      of him!\"       _She_. \"I know him a little too. He took me in to dinner a little      while ago!\"       _He_. \"Ah, that's just about all he's fit for!\"       _The Hostess_. \"Dear Miss Linnet! would you--would you sing one of      those charming ballads, while I go and see if supper's ready?\"       _The Companion_. \"O, don't ask me--I feel nervous. There are so      many people.\"       _The Hostess_. \"O, they won't listen, bless you! not one of them!      _Now_ DO!!!\"  And here is a conversation that betrays the presence of one of the currents of public feeling below the smooth surface of well-bred twaddle:       _In the Metropolitan Railway_. \"I beg your pardon, but I think I      had the pleasure of meeting you in Rome last year?\"       \"No, I've never been nearer to Rome than St. Alban's.\"       \"St. Alban's? Where is that?\"       \"Holborn.\"  Some rather amusing speeches of a different character in which du Maurier assails the more obvious forms of snobbery of a class below those with whom his art was generally concerned may be given:       _Among the Philistines_. _Grigsby_. \"Do you _know_ the Joneses,      Mrs. Brown?\"       \"No, we--er--don't care to know _Business_ people as a rule,      although my husband's in business; but then he's in the _Coffee_      Business and they're all _gentlemen_ in the _Coffee_ Business, you      know!\"       _Grigsby_ (who always suits himself to his company). \"_Really_ now!      Why, that's more than can be said of the Army, the Navy, the      Church, the Bar, or even the _House of Lords_! I don't _wonder_ at      your being rather _exclusive_!\" (_Punch's Almanac_, 1882).       \"I see your servants wear cockades now, Miss Shoddson!\"       \"Yes, Pa's just become a member of the Army and Navy Stores.\"   When du Maurier confined himself to observing and to recording he never failed for subjects. But we suppose as a concession to a section of the public he felt a leaven of mere jokes was demanded from him every year. The scene of his struggle to invent those \"jokes\" is one to be veiled. It is safe to say that it is his distinction to have contributed at once the best satire and the worst jokes that _Punch_ has ever published. A black and white artist has told the writer that the _Art_-Editors of papers look first at the joke. The drawing is accepted or rejected on the joke. We can only be glad that this was not entirely the editorial practice on _Punch_ in du Maurier's time. Perhaps the subjoined \"joke\" of du Maurier's from _Punch_ is the worst in the world:       \"I say, cousin Constance, I've found out why you always call your      Mamma 'Mater.'\"       \"Why, Guy?\"       \"Because she's always trying to find a mate for you girls.\"  [Illustration: Sketch for illustration for \"Wives and Daughters\" 1865.]  And yet if the drawing accompanying this joke be looked at _first_, it delights with its charm and distinction. Here then is a psychological fact; the drawing itself seems to the eye a poorer affair once the poor joke has been read. Having suffered in this way several times in following with admiration the pencil of du Maurier through the old volumes of _Punch_, we at last hit upon the plan of always covering the joke and enjoying first the picture for its own sake, only uncovering the legend when this has been thoroughly appreciated lest it should turn out to be merely a feeble joke instead of a happily-invented conversation. There are some of the drawings for jokes which we should very much like to have included with our illustrations, but the human mind being so constituted that it goes direct to the legend of an illustration, feeling \"sold\" if it isn't there, and the \"jokes\" in some of these instances being so fatal to the understanding of the atmosphere and charm of the drawing, we have had to abandon the idea of doing so. What the reader has to understand is that circumstances harnessed du Maurier to a certain business; he imported all manner of extraneous graces into it, and thus gave a determination to the character of the art of satire which it will never lose. The pages of _Punch_ were enriched, beautified, and made more delicately human. _Punch_ gained everything through the connection and du Maurier a stimulus in the demand for regular work. But it is not impossible to imagine circumstances which, but for this early connection with _Punch_, would have awakened and developed a different and perhaps profounder side of du Maurier, of which we seem to get a glimpse in the illustrations to Meredith in _The Cornhill Magazine_.   §8  The famous reply of an early Editor to the usual complaint that _Punch_ was not as good as it used to be--\"No, sir, it never was\"--cannot be considered to hold good in any comparison between the present period and that in which the arts of du Maurier and Keene held sway. There have been periods, there is such a one now, when the literary side of _Punch_ has touched a high-water mark. But on the illustrative side _Punch_ seems to be always hoping that another Keene or du Maurier will turn up. It does not seem prepared to accept work in quite another style. But there is no more chance of there ever being another Keene than of there being another Rembrandt, or of there ever being another du Maurier than another Watteau. The next genius to whom it is given to illuminate the pages of the classic journal in a style that will rival the past is not likely to arise from among those who think that there is no other view of life than that which was discovered by their immediate predecessors. By force of his genius--or, if you prefer it, of sympathy--which means the same thing--for some particular phase of life, some artist may at any moment uncover in its pages an altogether fresh kind of humour and of beauty.   § 9  Du Maurier's art covers the period when England was flushed with success. Artists in such times grow wealthy, and by their work refine their time. But in spite of the number of wealthy Academicians living upon Society in the mid-Victorian time, the influence of Art upon Society was less than at any time in history in which circumstances have been favourable to the artist.  The great wave of trade that carried the shop-keeper into the West-end drawing-room strewed also the curtains and carpets with that outrageous weed of _trade_ design which gave to the mid-Victorian world its complexion of singular hideousness.  The æsthetic movement indicated the restlessness of some of the brighter spirits with this condition, but many of its remedies were worse than the disease. The _nouveau_ artist-craftsman stood less chance than anybody of getting back to the secret of noble things, having forsaken the path of pure utility which, wherever it may go for a time, always leads back again to beauty. The disappearance of beauty for a time need not have been a cause of despair. Beauty will always come back if it is left alone. People had been swept off their feet with delight at what machinery could do, and they expected beauty to come out of it as a product at the same pace as everything else. It was not a mistake to expect it from any source, but from this particular source it could only come with time. There is evidence that it is on the way. And yet though the results of crude mechanical industrialism spoilt the outward appearance of the whole of the Victorian age, the earlier part at least of that time was one of marked personal refinement. We have but to look at portraits by George Richmond and others to receive a great impression of distinction. And this fact enables us to throw into clearer light the exact"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],["title","George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#5)"],["body","of du Maurier's work. If we seek for evidence in the old volumes of _Punch_ for the distinction of the early Victorians we shall not find it. We shall merely conceive instead a dislike for the type of gentleman of the time. Leech and his contemporaries did nothing more for their age than to make it look ridiculous for ever. But du Maurier gives us a real impression of the Society in which he moved. His ability to satirise society while still leaving it its dignity is unique. It may be said to be his distinctive contribution to the art of graphic satire. It gave to the Anglo-Saxon school its present-day characteristic, putting upon one of the very lightest forms of art the stamp of a noble time. The point is that whilst du Maurier thus deferred to the dignity of human nature he remained a satirist, not a humorist merely, as was Keene.  [Illustration]     II  THE ART OF DU MAURIER  § 1   If we wish to estimate the art of du Maurier at its full worth we must try and imagine _Punch_ from 1863 without this art, and try for a moment to conceive the difference this absence would make to our own present knowledge of the Victorians; also to the picture always entertained of England abroad.  If we are to believe du Maurier's art England is a petticoat-governed country. The men in his pictures are often made to recede into the background of Victorian ornament merely as ornaments themselves. As for the women, the mask of manner, the pleasantness concealing every shade of uncharitableness, all the arts of the contention for social precedence--in the interpretation of this sort of thing du Maurier is often quite uncanny, but he is never ruthless.  We have noticed that when du Maurier tried to draw ugly people he often only succeeded in turning out a figure of fun. Not to be beautiful and charming is to fail of being human, seems the judgment of his pencil. This was his limitation. And another was that, whilst professing to be concerned with humanity as a whole, he nearly always broke down with types that outraged the polite standard. He was a master in the description of Bishops and Curates, Generals and Men-about-town, but he broke down when he came to \"the out-sider.\" And, as we have already pointed out, he seldom got away from types to individuals.  In the last respect, however, we gain more perhaps than we lose. We gain a very vivid impression of the whole tone of the society in his time. And the fact of his art passing over the individual, for ever prevented it from cruelty, for to be cruel the individual must be hit. He did not satirise humanity, but Society. And his criticism was not of its members, but of its ways. Except in the case of children, he left unrevealed the individual heart that Keene so sympathetically exposed.  He made an original--and who will deny it?--a unique contribution to the history of satire, when he went to work through literalness and care for beauty in a field where nearly all previous success had rested with a sort of ruffianism. But chiefly one praises Heaven for the nurseryful of delightful children he let loose in his pages against the army of little monsters who reign as children in the Comic Press, bearing witness as they do to the unpleasant kind of mind even an artist can possess.  Though he ridiculed \"Camelot,\" his own tradition, as we have shown, was received from the Arthurian source. His chivalry gave his satire a very delicate edge. It was infinitely more cutting in showing the misfit of vulgarity with beauty than in showing vulgarity alone.  But du Maurier's gentlemanliness narrowed his range. It forced him into putting down something preposterous instead of a true type as soon as he wished to create \"a bounder.\" He found it impossible to get inside of a \"bounder\"--to be for the time a \"bounder\" himself. It is necessary for an artist to be able to be every character that he would create. And perhaps a satirist never wounds others so much as when he most wounds himself. Thackeray succeeded with snobbery because he had enough of it to go on with himself. We have shown the success of du Maurier with the æsthetes to go upon similar lines. The soul of satire is very often the bitterness of confession. In his very style the satirist of the æsthetes stood confessed almost as one of their number, whether he wished this to be seen or not--at least as one of the romantic school from whom they immediately descended. But he was genuine; where Postlethwaite and Maudle posed, his irritation was with the pose, the pretended preoccupation with beauty. He genuinely admired the Florentine revival, and to admire is to be jealous of those who take in vain. He wished to show up the \"æsthetes\" as the parasites they were, trading socially upon an inspiration too fragrant to be traded with at all.  Du Maurier, who assuredly knew what elegance was as well as any man of his time, took a great delight in pointing out to all whom it might concern, by illustration, that if there was any beauty of representation possible to him, as an artist, in depicting modern society, it was not in anything put forward in the shape of costume by the ladies of the æsthetic movement, but in the unacknowledged genius of ordinary dressmakers.  It was in his time that Philistinism met its match in Oscar Wilde, and for the first time in its history felt its self-complacency shaken. Up to that time it had been very proud of itself. With the loss of that pride it blundered, and it remained for du Maurier to show that the height of Philistinism in a Philistine is to pretend not to be a Philistine.  He had always seen what it would do present-day Londoners a world of good to see as clearly, that it is just those who affect, and who, by their lack of artistic constitution, are incapable of doing more than merely affecting, the understanding of art, who are the worst enemies it has in the world. He preferred the open Philistine. And so do we. The affectation described lends to art an artificial support which betrays those who attempt to rest any scheme for the promotion of art upon it.  But though du Maurier was not a Philistine he had the genius of respectability. His pencil could get on well with Bishops. It is easy enough to put a model into a Bishop's apron and gaiters, but that does not secure the drawing of a Bishop. It is necessary to observe that du Maurier found definite lines with his pencil for something so abstract as Broad-Churchmanship. The High-Churchman, with his perilous inclination to fervour, he was afraid of as a disturbing element, and kept him out of his drawings.  [Illustration]   §2  We have noted that it was du Maurier's peculiar genius to respond to \"attainment\" in life, even as the Greeks did, rather than to life's pathetic and romantic struggle. Du Maurier, we believe, was of opinion that if circumstances--he probably meant Editorial ones--had determined that he should apply his art to the lower classes he would have succeeded as well there as he did with Society. We prefer to believe that the Editorial instinct in the direction it gave to his work knew better. Many opportunities were afforded him for being as democratic in spirit as he liked, but he left such opportunities alone. His cab-runners run about in rain-shrunken suits that were obviously made in Savile Row; everyone of them, they are broken-down gentlemen. Coachmen, gardeners, footmen, pages, housekeepers, cooks, ladies' maids, and all those who move in the domestic circle of the upper classes he could draw, but his taste in life is a marked one, and that means it is a limited one. It is as marked as Meredith's, and it is much of the same kind; like that writer's great lady, Mrs. Mountstuart Jenkinson, he preferred persons \"that shone in the sun.\" This had nothing whatever to do with qualities of the heart; it was all an æsthetic predilection. The moment his pencil touched the theme of life lived upon as gentle a plane as possible, then something was kindled at its point which betrayed the presence of genuine inspiration. The inspiration was of the same nature as Watteau's, the grace of a certain aspect of life making an æsthetic appeal. Let this attraction to what is gracious in appearance, however, be kept distinct from the effect made by the spectacle of wealth upon the snob. Those who show us the beauty in the world, enrich the world with that much of beauty.  [Illustration: Pencil Studies from the Artist's Sketch Book]  In his _Life and Letters of Charles Keene_, Mr. G.S. Layard[1] says this:--  \"That Keene could have drawn the lovely be-Worthed young ladies and the splendidly proportioned and frock-coated young men with which Mr. du Maurier delights us week by week, not to speak of the god-like hero of his charming novel, I do not think anyone can doubt, had he set himself to do it, but it was part of the ineradicable Bohemianism of his character and the realistic bent of his genius that made him shun the representation of what he considered artificial and an outrage upon nature.\"  This, it will perhaps be admitted, is not very good art-criticism. Though in justice to its author it must be said that he did not wish to be regarded as Keene's critic as well as biographer.  An artist does not argue with himself that he will shun the representation of one particular side of life. He simply leaves it alone because he cannot help it; it does not attract him. He draws just that which interests him most and in the way in which it interests him; and exactly to the measure of his interest does his drawing possess vitality. Keene might have expressed with pungency his sense of certain things as being artificial and outrageous, but as long as his feelings towards them remained like that he could not express himself about them in any other way, certainly not in du Maurier's way--that is, with du Maurier's skill.  To the extent to which there _is_ a glamour and a beauty in fashion du Maurier is a realist. People who only now and then become"]]]
