What bright, holy song it was, which at that time surged through my soul, I have never been able to discover.  It must have been an old church hymn, like those which many a time stirred the rugged soul of our Luther.  I never heard it again, but many a time even now when I hear an adagio of Beethoven's, or a psalm of Marcellus, or a chorus of Handel's, or a simple song in the Scotch Highlands or the Tyrol, it seems to me as if the lofty church windows again glistened and the organ-tones once more surged through my soul, and a new world revealed itself--more beautiful than the starry heavens and the violet perfume.  These things I remember in my earliest childhood, and intermingled with them are my dear mother's looks, the calm, earnest gaze of my father, gardens and vine leaves, and soft green turf, and a very old and quaint picture-book--and this is all I can recall of the first scattered leaves of my childhood.  Afterwards it grows brighter and clearer.  Names and faces appear--not only father and mother, but brothers and sisters, friends and teachers, and a multitude of _strange people_.  Ah! yes, of these _strange people_ there is so much recorded in memory.     SECOND MEMORY.  Not far from our house, and opposite the old church with the golden cross, stood a large building, even larger than the church, and having many towers.  They looked exceedingly gray and old and had no golden cross, but stone eagles tipped the summits and a great white and blue banner fluttered from the highest tower, directly over the lofty doorway at the top of the steps, where, on either side, two mounted soldiers stood sentinels.  The building had many windows, and behind the windows you could distinguish red-silk curtains with golden tassels.  Old lindens encircled the grounds, which, in summer, overshadowed the gray masonry with their green leaves and bestrewed the turf with their fragrant white blossoms.  I had often looked in there, and at evening when the lindens exhaled their perfumes and the windows were illuminated, I saw many figures pass and repass like shadows. Music swept down from on high, and carriages drove up, from which ladies and gentlemen alighted and ascended the stairs.  They all looked so beautiful and good!  The gentlemen had stars upon their breasts, and the ladies wore fresh flowers in their hair; and I often thought,--Why do I not go there too?  One day my father took me by the hand and said: \"We are going to the castle; but you must be very polite if the Princess speaks to you, and kiss her hand.\"  I was about six years of age and as delighted as only one can be at six years of age.  I had already indulged in many quiet fancies about the shadows which I had seen evenings through the lighted windows, and had heard many good things at home of the beneficence of the Prince and Princess; how gracious they were; how much help and consolation they brought to the poor and sick; and that they had been chosen by the grace of God to protect the good and punish the bad.  I had long pictured to myself what transpired in the castle, so that the Prince and Princess were already old acquaintances whom I knew as well as my nut-crackers and leaden soldiers.  My heart beat quickly as I ascended the high stairs with my father, and just as he was telling me I must call the Princess \"Highness,\" and the Prince \"Serene Highness,\" the folding-door opened and I saw before me a tall figure with brilliantly piercing eyes.  She seemed to advance and stretch out her hand to me.  There was an expression on her countenance which I had long known, and a heavenly smile played about her cheeks. I could restrain myself no longer, and while my father stood at the door bowing very low--I knew not why--my heart sprang into my throat. I ran to the beautiful lady, threw my arms round her neck and kissed her as I would my mother.  The beautiful, majestic lady willingly submitted, stroked my hair and smiled; but my father took my hand, led me away, and said I was very rude, and that he should never take me there again.  I grew utterly bewildered.  The blood mounted to my cheeks, for I felt that my father had been unjust to me.  I looked at the Princess as if she ought to shield me, but upon her face was only an expression of mild earnestness.  Then I looked round upon the ladies and gentlemen assembled in the room, believing that they would come to my defense.  But as I looked, I saw that they were laughing.  Then the tears sprang into my eyes, and out of the door, down the stairs, and past the lindens in the castle yard, I rushed home, where I threw myself into my mother's arms and sobbed and wept.  \"What has happened to you?\" said she.  \"Oh! mother!\" I cried; \"I was at the Princess', and she was such a good and beautiful woman, just like you, dear mother, that I had to throw my arms round her neck and kiss her.\"  \"Ah!\" said my mother; \"you should not have done that, for they are strangers and high dignitaries.\"  \"And what then are strangers?\" said I.  \"May I not love all people who look upon me with affectionate and friendly eyes?\"  \"You can love them, my son,\" replied my mother, \"but you should not show it.\"  \"Is it then something wrong for me to love people?\" said I.  \"Why cannot I show it?\"  \"Well, perhaps you are right,\" said she, \"but you must do as your father says, and when you are older you will understand why you cannot embrace every woman who regards you with affectionate and friendly eyes.\"  That was a sad day.  Father came home, agreed I had been very uncivil. At night my mother put me to bed, and I prayed, but I could not sleep, and kept wondering what these strange people were, whom one must not love.        *      *      *      *      *  Thou poor human heart!  So soon in the spring are thy leaves broken and the feathers torn from the wings!  When the spring-red of life opens the hidden calyx of the soul, it perfumes our whole being with love. We learn to stand and to walk, to speak and to read, but no one teaches us love.  It is inherent in us like life, they say, and is the very deepest foundation of our existence.  As the heavenly bodies incline to and attract each other, and will always cling together by the everlasting law of gravitation, so heavenly souls incline to and attract each other, and will always cling together by the everlasting law of love.  A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love.  Would not the child's heart break in despair when the first cold storm of the world sweeps over it, if the warm sunlight of love from the eyes of mother and father did not shine upon him like the soft reflection of divine light and love?  The ardent yearning, which then awakes in the child, is the purest and deepest love.  It is the love which embraces the whole world; which shines resplendent wherever the eyes of men beam upon it, which exults wherever it hears the human voice.  It is the old, immeasurable love, a deep well which no plummet has ever sounded; a fountain of perennial richness.  Whoever knows it also knows that in love there is no More and no Less; but that he who loves can only love with the whole heart, and with the whole soul; with all his strength and with all his will.  But, alas, how little remains of this love by the time we have finished one-half of our life-journey!  Soon the child learns that there are strangers, and ceases to be a child.  The spring of love becomes hidden and soon filled up.  Our eyes gleam no more, and heavy-hearted we pass one another in the bustling streets.  We scarcely greet each other, for we know how sharply it cuts the soul when a greeting remains unanswered, and how sad it is to be sundered from those whom we have once greeted, and whose hands we have clasped.  The wings of the soul lose their plumes; the leaves of the flower fast fall off and wither; and of this fountain of love there remain but a few drops.  We still call these few drops love, but it is no longer the clear, fresh, all-abounding child-love.  It is love with anxiety and trouble, a consuming flame, a burning passion; love which wastes itself like rain-drops upon the hot sand; love which is a longing, not a sacrifice; love which says \"Wilt thou be mine,\" not love which says, \"I must be thine.\"  It is a most selfish, vacillating love.  And this is the love which poets sing and in which young men and maidens believe; a fire which burns up and down, yet does not warm, and leaves nothing behind but smoke and ashes.  All of us at some period of life have believed that these rockets of sunbeams were everlasting love, but the brighter the glitter, the darker the night which follows.  And then when all around grows dark, when we feel utterly alone, when all men right and left pass us by and know us not, a forgotten feeling rises in the breast.  We know not what it is, for it is neither love nor friendship.  You feel like crying to him who passes you so cold and strange: \"Dost thou not know me?\"  Then one realizes that man is nearer to man than brother to brother, father to son, or friend to friend. How an old, holy saying rings through our souls, that strangers are nearest to us.  Why must we pass them in silence?  We know not, but must resign ourselves to it.  When two trains are rushing by upon the iron rails and thou seest a well-known eye that would recognize thee, stretch out thy hand and try to grasp the hand of a friend, and perhaps thou wilt understand why man passes man in silence here below.  An old sage says: \"I saw the fragments of a wrecked boat floating on the sea.  Only a few meet and hold together a long time.  Then comes a storm and drives them east and west, and here below they will never meet again.  So it is with mankind.  Yet no one has seen the great shipwreck.\"     THIRD MEMORY.  The clouds in the sky of childhood do not last long,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],["title","Memories: A Story of German Love (#2)"],["body","disappear after a short, warm tear-rain.  I was shortly again at the castle, and the Princess gave me her hand to kiss and then brought her children, the young princes and princesses, and we played together, as if we had known each other for years.  Those were happy days when, after school--for I was now attending school--I could go to the castle and play.  We had everything the heart could wish.  I found playthings there which my mother had shown me in the shop-windows, and which were so dear, she told me, that poor people could live a whole week on what they cost.  When I begged the Princess' permission to take them home and show them to my mother, she was perfectly willing.  I could turn over and over and look for hours at a time at beautiful picture books, which I had seen in the book stores with my father, but which were made only for very good children.  Everything which belonged to the young princes belonged also to me--so I thought, at least.  Furthermore, I was not only allowed to carry away what I wished, but I often gave away the playthings to other children.  In short, I was a young Communist, in the full sense of the term.  I remember at one time the Princess had a golden snake which coiled itself around her arm as if it were alive, and she gave it to us for a plaything.  As I was going home I put the snake on my arm and thought I would give my mother a real fright with it.  On the way, however, I met a woman who noticed the snake and begged me to show it to her; and then she said if she could only keep the golden snake, she could release her husband from prison with it. Naturally I did not stop to think for a minute, but ran away and left the woman alone with the golden serpent-bracelet.  The next day there was much excitement.  The poor woman was brought to the castle and the people said she had stolen it.  Thereupon I grew very angry and explained with holy zeal that I had given her the bracelet and that I would not take it back again.  What further occurred I know not, but I remember that after that time, I showed the Princess everything I took home with me.  It was a long time before my conceptions of Meum and Tuum were fully settled, and at a very late period they were at times confused, just as it was a long time before I could distinguish between the blue and red colors.  The last time I remember my friends laughing at me on this account was when my mother gave me some money to buy apples.  She gave me a groschen.  The apples cost only a sechser, and when I gave the woman the groschen, she said, very sadly as it seemed to me, that she had sold nothing the whole livelong day and could not give me back a sechser.  She wished I would buy a groschen's worth.  Then it occurred to me that I also had a sechser in my pocket, and thoroughly delighted that I had solved the difficult problem, I gave it to the woman and said: \"Now you can give me back a sechser.\"  She understood me so little however that she gave me back the groschen and kept the sechser.  At this time, while I was making almost daily visits to the young princes at the castle, both to play as well as to study French with them, another image comes up in my memory.  It was the daughter of the Princess, the Countess Marie.  The mother died shortly after the birth of the child and the Prince subsequently married a second time.  I know not when I saw her for the first time.  She emerges from the darkness of memory slowly and gradually--at first like an airy shadow which grows more and more distinct as it approaches nearer and nearer, at last standing before my soul like the moon, which on some stormy night throws back the cloud-veils from across its face.  She was always sick and suffering and silent, and I never saw her except reclining upon her couch, upon which two servants brought her into the room and carried her out again, when she was tired.  There she lay in her flowing white drapery, with her hands generally folded.  Her face was so pale and yet so mild, and her eyes so deep and unfathomable, that I often stood before her lost in thought and looked upon her and asked myself if she was not one of the \"strange people\" also.  Many a time she placed her hand upon my head and then it seemed to me that a thrill ran through all my limbs and that I could not move or speak, but must forever gaze into her deep, unfathomable eyes.  She conversed very little with us, but watched our sports, and when at times we grew very noisy and quarrelsome, she did not complain but held her white hands over her brow and closed her eyes as if sleeping.  But there were days when she said she felt better, and on such days she sat up on her couch, conversed with us and told us curious stories.  I do not know how old she was at that time.  She was so helpless that she seemed like a child, and yet was so serious and silent that she could not have been one.  When people alluded to her they involuntarily spoke gently and softly.  They called her \"the angel,\" and I never heard anything said of her that was not good and lovely.  Often when I saw her lying so silent and helpless, and thought that she would never walk again in life, that there was for her neither work nor joy, that they would carry her here and there upon her couch until they laid her upon her eternal bed of rest, I asked myself why she had been sent into this world, when she could have rested so gently on the bosom of the angels and they could have borne her through the air on their white wings, as I had seen in some sacred pictures.  Again I felt as if I must take a part of her burden, so that she need not carry it alone, but we with her.  I could not tell her all this for I knew it was not proper.  I had an indefinable feeling.  It was not a desire to embrace her.  No one could have done that, for it would have wronged her.  It seemed to me as if I could pray from the very bottom of my heart that she might be released from her burden.  One warm spring day she was brought into our room.  She looked exceedingly pale; but her eyes were deeper and brighter than ever, and she sat upon her couch and called us to her.  \"It is my birth-day,\" said she, \"and I was confirmed early this morning.  Now, it is possible,\" she continued as she looked upon her father with a smile, \"that God may soon call me to him, although I would gladly remain with you much longer.  But if I am to leave you, I desire that you should not wholly forget me; and, therefore, I have brought a ring for each of you, which you must now place upon the fore-finger.  As you grow older you can continue to change it until it fits the little finger; but you must wear it for your lifetime.\"  With these words she took the five rings she wore upon her fingers, which she drew off, one after the other, with a look so sad and yet so affectionate, that I pressed my eyes closely to keep from weeping.  She gave the first ring to her eldest brother and kissed him, the second and third to the two princesses, and the fourth to the youngest prince, and kissed them all as she gave them the rings.  I stood near by, and, looking fixedly at her white hand, saw that she still had a ring upon her finger; but she leaned back and appeared wearied.  My eyes met hers, and as the eyes of a child speak so loudly, she must have easily known my thoughts, I would rather not have had the last ring, for I felt that I was a stranger; that I did not belong to her, and that she was not as affectionate to me as to her brothers and sisters.  Then came a sharp pain in my breast as if a vein had burst or a nerve had been severed, and I knew not which way to turn to conceal my anguish.  She soon raised herself again, placed her hand upon my forehead and looked down into my heart so deeply that I felt I had not a thought invisible to her.  She slowly drew the last ring from her finger, gave it to me and said; \"I intended to have taken this with me, when I went from you, but it is better you should wear it and think of me when I am no longer with you.  Read the words engraved upon the ring: 'As God wills.'  You have a passionate heart, easily moved.  May life subdue but not harden it.\"  Then she kissed me as she had her brothers and gave me the ring.  All my feelings I do not truly know.  I had then grown up to boyhood, and the mild beauty of the suffering angel could not linger in my young heart without alluring it.  I loved her as only a boy can love, and boys love with an intensity and truth and purity which few preserve in their youth and manhood; but I believed she belonged to the \"strange people\" to whom you are not allowed to speak of love.  I scarcely understood the earnest words she spoke to me.  I only felt that her soul was as near to mine as one human soul can be to another.  All bitterness was gone from my heart.  I felt myself no longer alone, no longer a stranger, no longer shut out.  I was by her, with her and in her.  I thought it might be a sacrifice for her to give me the ring, and that she might have preferred to take it to the grave with her, and a feeling arose in my soul which overshadowed all other feelings, and I said with quivering voice: \"Thou must keep the ring if thou dost not wish to give it to me; for what is thine is mine.\"  She looked at me a moment surprised and thoughtfully.  Then she took the ring, placed it on her finger, kissed me once more on the forehead, and said gently to me: \"Thou knowest not what thou sayest.  Learn to understand thyself. Then shall thou be happy and make many others happy.\"     FOURTH MEMORY.  Every life has its years in which one progresses as on a tedious and dusty street of poplars, without caring to know where he is.  Of these years nought remains in memory but the sad feeling that we have advanced and only grown older.  While the river of life glides along smoothly, it remains the same river; only the landscape on either bank seems to change.  But then come the cataracts of life.  They are firmly fixed in memory,"]]]
