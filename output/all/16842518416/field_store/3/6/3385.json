He asks you to give your life to him. He has a special work for you to do. You have heard of Wendell Phillips who did so much to make slavery unlawful in America! Once, when Wendell was a boy fourteen years of age, he heard Lyman Beecher preach. In the course of his sermon the preacher said, \"You belong to God.\" The boy Wendell thought that the preacher looked straight at him when he said that. He went to his home at the close of the service, climbed the stairs to his room, shut the door, knelt in prayer, saying, \"O God, I belong to thee, take what is thine own.\" He heard and answered God's call.  Many, many years before Wendell Phillips lived there was another boy. He worked in the temple. He was a youthful assistant to the minister. I suppose he ran errands for him, and performed any and every service about the temple the minister desired. One night, as usual, the boy went to bed and fell asleep. As he slept he heard a voice calling him. Now he was an obedient boy, and though it was hard for him to rouse himself from a sound sleep and leave his comfortable bed he did so. He ran to the minister saying, \"Here I am, you called me, what do you want?\" The minister said, \"No, my boy, I did not call you, go back to bed.\" The boy returned to his bed and again went to sleep. A second time, and even a third time he was called. Each time the faithful, obedient lad leaped from his couch and ran to the minister. The third time it dawned on the mind of the minister that the voice the lad heard was the voice of God, calling him to himself and to his special service. Being a wise and loving man he said to the boy, \"Return to your bed, and if you hear the call again, say, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'\" The boy did as instructed and that night was forever memorable in his life, for that was the night God called Samuel and Samuel answered.  MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 3: 10      \"And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times,     Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak, for thy servant     heareth.\"  MEMORY HYMN [674]      _\"Hushed was the evening hymn.\"_     A HAPPY HOME   This morning, the first thing, my boy said to me, \"Tell me a story.\" This is the story I told him. Once upon a time, it was a long, long time ago, so long ago that we can scarcely realize how long, more than twenty-five hundred years ago. Well, once upon a time there was a home--homes then were quite the same in most ways as homes are now--there were children in that home. They played and were happy. And too, I suppose they had their misunderstandings, and sometimes the children quarreled. One day the children heard music. Looking up the street they saw a great company of men marching right toward them. They were soldiers. There were thirty thousand of them. In the center of the marching army were some oxen. The oxen were harnessed to a fine, new cart. On the cart was a chest, most beautifully carved and decorated. On the soldiers came. What was the amazement of the boys and girls when they stopped right in front of their house! Then the king, majestic in his bearing and gorgeously arrayed, came to their father and said, \"I want to leave this chest here in your house. Take good care of it.\" The king's men brought the wonderful chest within, set it down, went out, and the army marched away. From that hour the home was a different home. There was joy, and peace, and an utter absence of quarreling. Three months passed by. Then one day the king came again and took the chest away. But peace and happiness did not depart with the chest. The home was as happy and peaceful and free from bickering through all the coming months as through the three when the wonderful chest was in the house. What was the chest? It was not the king's chest; it was the ark of God. You will find this true story in Second Samuel, the sixth chapter.  Memory Verse, _II Samuel_ 6: 11      \"And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the     Gittite three months; and the Lord blessed him, and all his     household.\"  MEMORY HYMN [671]      _\"O happy home, where thou art loved the dearest.\"_     SYSTEM   Here are three books. I put them down like this, one beside the other, that is system. I throw them down carelessly, that is not system, it is not orderly.  Here is a little box. Inside are letters, such as you see on the sign in front of the Church. Each letter has a space all its own. Now if A were put down at M, M at Z, and E at X, what a task it would be to pick out the letters and make a sign!  One day I visited a Chinese school. Such lack of system, such disorderliness I never did see! Such noise I never did hear! They were all studying at the tops of their voices, sitting around in all sorts of ways, each trying to out-shout the other. Another day I went into a school here in our city. I saw the desks arranged in systematic fashion, each child with a desk all his own. In front I saw a platform, with a larger desk, for the teacher. All was quiet and orderly.  Here I have a package of envelopes. There are fifty-two envelopes, one for each Sunday in the year. Each envelope is divided in the center. On one side I read, \"For others.\" On the other half I read, \"For ourselves.\" I need not tell you that these are church envelopes. In this way, this systematic way, we support our local church and pay to missions. We like to have the girls and boys, as well as older people, use these envelopes. The financial secretary of your church is just as willing to keep the records of young people who give but five cents in each side of the envelope as he is to keep the account of the man or woman who places five dollars in each side of the envelope every Sunday. You see we want you to grow up systematic and orderly in all your religious life. Our Master is pleased when we do our religious duties \"decently and in order.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 16: 2      \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in     store, as God hath prospered him.\"  MEMORY HYMN [631]      _\"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun.\"_     A BOY FROM THE COUNTRY   Once upon a time there was a boy who lived in the country. It was said of him that he was \"ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.\" I think that description fits a country lad. Well, this boy had brothers who were away from home in the army, fighting. One day the boy's father said to him, \"I wish you would go down and see how your brothers are getting along, and take with you this present.\" The boy started on his journey. Now when he came to the place where the soldiers were encamped he saw a strange sight. A giant, from the opposing army, came out, blustering and issuing his challenge to any one who would dare come against him. All seemed afraid of him. Even the big, strong soldiers would not do battle with him. Therefore this youth from the country volunteered saying, \"I will go out and fight him.\" They tried to dissuade him, but he insisted. Now he was a perfect shot with the sling. He chose five smooth stones from the brook. With one of these he prevailed over the giant.  This lad, however, had some other things which stood him in better stead even than the sling and the stones. What were they? First, he had courage. He possessed what all the others lacked. Second, he had the ability to do one thing and do that one thing well. He could use a sling with the utmost accuracy. Third, he had confidence in himself and faith in God. He was not conceited, no, we do not like that. Rather he had self-confidence. Above all was this--\"I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.\" So said the lad from the country as he went to fight the giant. What was his name? It is a good name--David.  MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 17: 45      \"Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a     shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.\"  MEMORY HYMN [416]      _\"Faith of our fathers.\"_     THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD   The most beautiful thing in the world! Now what is it? If you will lift your eyes just a little you will see the flowers on the table, but lift them higher than the flowers, higher than this pulpit, higher than the pipes of the organ, above the lights, above the arch, you will see the most beautiful thing in the world. Do you see it? It is the Cross.  Do you know, girls and boys, that long ago the cross was the most repulsive thing in the world? It was odious. It had none of the charm and beauty that is now woven about it. But from the day that Jesus was crucified on the cross it took on new meaning, and it has grown in charm and power until I think we all agree that it is the most beautiful sight in the world.  Out in Colorado, high up the side of a mountain, where the snow never melts in the crevices, may be seen two long ravines, one straight up and down, the other straight across. The snow is packed into those ravines all through the year, and lifting the eyes one may see upon the lofty mountain side the Holy Cross.  In the summer seas, one of the things that mariners are guided by and that tourists look for, is the Southern Cross. There it is, fashioned by the position of the stars in the clear skies of the tropics.  There are many men who wear a cross as a watch fob. There are women who wear a cross as a pendant about the neck. This is an outward sign of an inner devotion. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],["title","The Children's Six Minutes (#2)"],["body","thing, my dear young Christians, is to have the cross, its power and meaning, stamped upon one's heart. Is that where you wear the Saviour's cross?  MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 1: 18      \"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish     foolishness; but unto them which are saved it is the power of     God.\"  MEMORY HYMN [143]      _\"In the cross of Christ I glory.\"_     EASTER LIGHT   This glad morning, when the world is so bright and beautiful, I want to talk to you about Easter Light.  One of the most interesting men in our city is a man who goes about our streets with two long sticks. He is the lamplighter. Here he comes down the street! See how he pauses at each lamp post. With one stick he pulls the little chain that turns on the gas; with the other he sets the light going. He walks into the dark, but he leaves behind him miles of lighted streets. I hope we shall have always many streets lighted with gas, for I love to see the lamplighter dot his way along the streets and avenues with lighted periods.  In the center of our city is the tall Electric Light Building. On the very tip of the tower is a high power electric light. It is lighted every evening from eight to eleven o'clock. Children, looking out of their windows as they go to bed, think that it is another star in the sky, it is so bright and steady.  More wonderful than any of these lights is the source of all light. It is the light that God provides for all of his children. The sun warms our fields, makes our gardens grow, and causes our harvests to prosper. The sun never fails us.  Now there is another light, a light that is above even the sun. That is the light of Easter day. The tomb of death is no longer dark, for the resurrection light brightens every corner and shines in radiance through the open doorway. The light of Easter also lights up the windows of our heavenly home. When you are out of an evening it is not pleasant to return to a dark house. There is a wondrous welcome in lighted windows. That welcome God gives us in the light of Easter day. Christ, and his resurrection, shine in the windows of heaven to greet us when we go home.  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 28: 1      \"In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first     day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the     sepulchre.\"  MEMORY HYMN [156]      _\"Christ the Lord is risen to-day.\"_     APRIL   I have in my hand a small branch from a big tree. This branch is from an apple tree. Here are seen the tiny buds, the promise of the blossom, and after that the fruit. Have you ever seen an apple orchard in blossom? People rave about the cherry blossoms of Japan, and the fire trees, flaming red, of the Philippines. I have been in both countries, but I think there is no more beautiful sight in any country than the blossoming apple orchards of America.  As you came to church this morning you saw all along the streets and avenues hundreds of trees like this branch, sending forth their first buds. What do these buds tell us?  First of all they tell us of God. I do not see how any one can live through the awakening spring season and not think daily thoughts of God. Most people remember the Creator. Only one person has ever denied God. \"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.\" He said it to himself, he did not dare speak it out loud.  In the second place, this branch tells us of God's Love. He, the loving Father of all people, makes blessed provision for the care and nurture of his children. He reminds us each year, in seedtime and harvest, of his boundless love. His love never fails. There have been many hundreds of years in the history of the world, yet each year has had its spring, its seedtime, and its Resurrection. Young people, let God's April speak to you.      \"When I am gone, somehow I hope that April     Will typify my life, my faith,     My hope of victory through the years,     My steadiness of step, my clear and visioned eye.     The early flowers, the birds     Singing in the rain,     The increasing light, the slowly opening buds,     The almond blooms, the trees in vernal dress     Are like the silver crown upon the head;     A prophecy of heaven's summer time.     Yes, even now it is the April     Of my great immortality.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 11: 25      \"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life.\"  MEMORY HYMN [389]      _\"Sow in the morn thy seed.\"_     HELPING FINGERS   For three years I lived in Manila, Philippine Islands. Not far from my home was an orphanage for children who were deaf and dumb. Frequently these children were seen at different entertainments that were given about the city. One evening I went to attend a lecture in the Y.M.C.A. Right in front of me sat three children. They were very quiet and orderly. When the lecture began the boy who sat in the middle began to make his fingers go as fast as he could, the two children on either side watching him intently. That center boy could hear, the other two were deaf. So he heard the lecture for them and told it to them by the finger language.  One day a girl, coming out from school, got on a street car to go to her home. The car was crowded. She found a seat next to a woman who was heavily laden with bundles. She had all she could do to hold those bundles in her lap and keep them from falling and scattering their contents on the floor. Then a string about one of the packages became untied. She struggled to get that string fastened securely. She had so many packages, her fingers were numb with cold, and again and again the string slipped just at the crucial time. Finally this school girl, who was an attractive, well-dressed girl, reached over and placed her nicely gloved finger on the obstreperous knot. There was a grateful smile from the troubled woman and a hearty \"Thank you.\" The next stop was the girl's home. As she went to the end of the car she passed a school friend who had watched the little incident. She said to her, \"I see you belong to the helping hand society.\" \"No,\" replied the girl, \"not the helping hand, just the helping finger society.\" This is a great society, girls and boys. Admission to it requires no initiation fee, no dues, simply the desire and the will to be helpful wherever you are.  MEMORY VERSE, _Ecclesiastes_ 9: 10      \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\"  MEMORY HYMN [349]      _\"Saviour, thy dying love thou gavest me.\"_     TWO R'S AND AN A   Do you know what week this is? We have all sorts of weeks, don't we! There is Sunday School week, Go to Church week, Boy Scout week, Red Cross week, Social Welfare week, Hospital week, Y.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A. week. Sometimes we wish we could have one week all to ourselves.  Well, this is a special week. It is called Good Literature week. I want to tell you about Good Literature week by the use of these three letters, two R's and an A.  The first R stands for Read. By all means read. There is no excuse for not reading, there is so much to read. Indeed I think that is the chief difficulty, we have too much, at least too much of that which is not good to read. Here's the bulky daily paper. When it is delivered there is a rush for it. The children want the comic supplement. So do some of the grownups.      \"A little nonsense now and then,     Is relished by the wisest men.\"  That is true, and all right, but read something beside the comics.  The second R is Remember. You cannot remember all that you read. You can remember much. You should train your mind to remember the best. John Ruskin, one of the most gifted of Englishmen, said, \"To this I owe all that I have of power, to the fact that when I was a boy my mother made me learn, every day, and remember, a verse of the Bible.\"  Now the A. The A stands for, can you guess? It means Action. Read, remember what you read, and then apply it, put it into action. It is a fine thing to read a story like Pollyanna and get all excited over it. It is much finer to read Pollyanna and then put her spirit into action in the daily life of the home.  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 11      \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might; not sin against     thee.\"  MEMORY HYMN [201]      _\"How precious is the book divine!\"_     CANDLE CHILDREN   What is this I have here? It is a candle in a candlestick. There is something about a candle we all love. We have our clear gas lights and our still more brilliant electric bulbs, but when the birthday comes we want a cake with candles on it. Think of this as a birthday candle and let it speak to you.  First of all this candle speaks of Symmetry. How perfectly formed is this candle! It is smooth, there are no rough places that stand out like an ugly wart on one's face. Your life should have symmetry. God asks you to give heed to your physical, your mental and your spiritual duties that your life may be well rounded, a life of beautiful symmetry.  Second, this candle stands for Fragrance. This is a fragrant candle. It is what is known as a \"barberry\" candle. There are some children we do not like to have around, they are surly, sulky and mean. There are others we dear love to have with us at all times. They have what I call fragrance. They have the fragrance of thoughtfulness, the sweetness of unselfishness.  In the third place this candle means Erectness. How straight it stands in the candlestick! Stand up straight, girls and boys. Do not stoop. Do not hump yourself over your school desk. Walk erect. It means so much now, it will mean much more in later years. Some day, if you heed my word, you will be grateful that the preacher once said to you so emphatically that you could not forget, \"John, Mary, stand up straight.\"  Fourth, the candle stands for Light. It is useless until the wick is lighted. It burns for others. Your life is a light. Jesus wants all Christians to think of themselves as lights in the world. \"Let your light shine.\" Be a lighted candle for the Lord.  MEMORY"]]]
