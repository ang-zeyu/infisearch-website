Then Elder J. with lifted eyes       In musing posture stood,     Invoked a blessing from the skies     To save from vermin, mites and flies,       And keep the bounty good.      Now mellow strokes the yielding pile       From polished steel receives,     And shining nymphs stand still a while,     Or mix the mass with salt and oil,       With sage and savory leaves.      Then sextonlike, the patriot troop,       With naked arms and crown,     Embraced, with hardy hands, the scoop,     And filled the vast expanded hoop,       While beetles smacked it down.      Next girding screws the ponderous beam,       With heft immense, drew down;     The gushing whey from every seam     Flowed through the streets a rapid stream,       And shad came up to town.  This spirited achievement of early democracy is commemorated today by a sign set up at the ancient and honorable town of Cheshire, located between Pittsfield and North Adams, on Route 8.  Jefferson's speech of thanks to the democratic people of Cheshire rings out in history: \"I look upon this cheese as a token of fidelity from the very heart of the people of this land to the great cause of equal rights to all men.\"  This popular presentation started a tradition. When Van Buren succeeded to the Presidency, he received a similar mammoth cheese in token of the high esteem in which he was held. A monstrous one, bigger than the Jeffersonian, was made by New Englanders to show their loyalty to President Jackson. For weeks this stood in state in the hall of the White House. At last the floor was a foot deep in the fragments remaining after the enthusiastic Democrats had eaten their fill.     [Illustration]  _Chapter Three_  Foreign Greats          _Ode to Cheese_       God of the country, bless today Thy cheese,     For which we give Thee thanks on bended knees.     Let them be fat or light, with onions blent,     Shallots, brine, pepper, honey; whether scent     Of sheep or fields is in them, in the yard     Let them, good Lord, at dawn be beaten hard.     And let their edges take on silvery shades     Under the moist red hands of dairymaids;     And, round and greenish, let them go to town     Weighing the shepherd's folding mantle down;     Whether from Parma or from Jura heights,     Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites,     Stamped with the mitre of a proud abbess.     Flowered with the perfumes of the grass of Bresse,     From hollow Holland, from the Vosges, from Brie,     From Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Italy!     Bless them, good Lord! Bless Stilton's royal fare,     Red Cheshire, and the tearful cream Gruyère.      FROM JETHRO BITHELL'S TRANSLATION     OF A POEM BY M. Thomas Braun       _Symphonie des Fromages_       A giant Cantal, seeming to have been chopped open with an ax,      stood aside of a golden-hued Chester and a Swiss Gruyère      resembling the wheel of a Roman chariot There were Dutch Edams,      round and blood-red, and Port-Saluts lined up like soldiers on      parade. Three Bries, side by side, suggested phases of the moon;      two of them, very dry, were amber-colored and \"full,\" and the      third, in its second quarter, was runny and creamy, with a \"milky      way\" which no human barrier seemed able to restrain. And all the      while majestic Roqueforts looked down with princely contempt upon      the other, through the glass of their crystal covers.       Emile Zola  In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture published Handbook No. 54, entitled _Cheese Varieties and Descriptions,_ with this comment: \"There probably are only about eighteen distinct types or kinds of natural cheese.\" All the rest (more than 400 names) are of local origin, usually named after towns or communities. A list of the best-known names applied to each of these distinct varieties or groups is given:          Brick        Gouda         Romano         Camembert    Hand          Roquefort         Cheddar      Limburger     Sapsago         Cottage      Neufchâtel    Swiss         Cream        Parmesan      Trappist         Edam         Provolone     Whey cheeses (Mysost and Ricotta)   May we nominate another dozen to form our own Cheese Hall of Fame? We begin our list with a partial roll call of the big Blues family and end it with members of the monastic order of Port-Salut Trappist that includes Canadian Oka and our own Kentucky thoroughbred.   The Blues that Are Green  Stilton, Roquefort and Gorgonzola form the triumvirate that rules a world of lesser Blues. They are actually green, as green as the mythical cheese the moon is made of.  In almost every, land where cheese is made you can sample a handful of lesser Blues and imitations of the invincible three and try to classify them, until you're blue in the face. The best we can do in this slight summary is to mention a few of the most notable, aside from our own Blues of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and other states that major in cheese.  Danish Blues are popular and splendidly made, such as \"Flower of Denmark.\" The Argentine competes with a pampas-grass Blue all its own. But France and England are the leaders in this line, France first with a sort of triple triumvirate within a triumvirate--Septmoncel, Gex, and Sassenage, all three made with three milks mixed together: cow, goat and sheep. Septmoncel is the leader of these, made in the Jura mountains and considered by many French caseophiles to outrank Roquefort.  This class of Blue or marbled cheese is called fromage persillé, as well as fromage bleu and pate bleue. Similar mountain cheeses are made in Auvergne and Aubrac and have distinct qualities that have brought them fame, such as Cantal, bleu d'Auvergne Guiole or Laguiole, bleu de Salers, and St. Flour. Olivet and Queville come within the color scheme, and sundry others such as Champoléon, Journiac, Queyras and Sarraz.  Of English Blues there are several celebrities beside Stilton and Cheshire Stilton. Wensleydale was one in the early days, and still is, together with Blue Dorset, the deepest green of them all, and esoteric Blue Vinny, a choosey cheese not liked by everybody, the favorite of Thomas Hardy.   Brie  Sheila Hibben once wrote in _The New Yorker:_  I can't imagine any difference of opinion about Brie's being the queen of all cheeses, and if there is any such difference, I shall certainly ignore it. The very shape of Brie--so uncheese-like and so charmingly fragile--is exciting. Nine times out of ten a Brie will let you down--will be all caked into layers, which shows it is too young, or at the over-runny stage, which means it is too old--but when you come on the tenth Brie, _coulant_ to just the right, delicate creaminess, and the color of fresh, sweet butter, no other cheese can compare with it.  The season of Brie, like that of oysters, is simple to remember: only months with an \"R,\" beginning with September, which is the best, bar none.   Caciocavallo  From Bulgaria to Turkey the Italian \"horse cheese,\" as Caciocavallo translates, is as universally popular as it is at home and in all the Little Italics throughout the rest of the world. Flattering imitations are made and named after it, as follows:      BULGARIA:       Kascaval      GREECE:         Kashcavallo and Caskcaval      HUNGARY:        Parenica      RUMANIA:        Pentele and Kascaval      SERBIA:         Katschkawalj      SYRIA:          Cashkavallo      TRANSYLVANIA:   Kascaval (as in Rumania)      TURKEY:         Cascaval Penir      YUGOSLAVIA:     Kackavalj  A horse's head printed on the cheese gave rise to its popular name and to the myth that it is made of mare's milk. It is, however, curded from cow's milk, whole or partly skimmed, and sometimes from water buffalo; hard, yellow and so buttery that the best of it, which comes from Sorrento, is called _Cacio burro,_ butter cheese. Slightly salty, with a spicy tang, it is eaten sliced when young and mild and used for grating and seasoning when old, not only on the usual Italian pastes but on sweets.  Different from the many grating cheeses made from little balls of curd called _grana_, Caciocavallo is a _pasta fileta_, or drawn-curd product. Because of this it is sometimes drawn out in long thick threads and braided. It is a cheese for skilled artists to make sculptures with, sometimes horses' heads, again bunches of grapes and other fruits, even as Provolone is shaped like apples and pears and often worked into elaborate bas-relief designs. But ordinarily the horse's head is a plain tenpin in shape or a squat bottle with a knob on the side by which it has been tied up, two cheeses at a time, on opposite sides of a rafter, while being smoked lightly golden and rubbed with olive oil and butter to make it all the more buttery.  In Calabria and Sicily it is very popular, and although the best comes from Sorrento, there is keen competition from Abruzzi, Apulian Province and Molise. It keeps well and doesn't spoil when shipped overseas.  In his _Little Book of Cheese_ Osbert Burdett recommends the high, horsy strength of this smoked Cacio over tobacco smoke after dinner:       Only monsters smoke at meals, but a monster assured me that      Gorgonzola best survives this malpractice. Clearly, some pungency      is necessary, and confidence suggests rather Cacio which would      survive anything, the monster said.  Camembert  Camembert is called \"mold-matured\" and all that is genuine is labeled _Syndicat du Vrai Camembert_. The name in full is _Syndicat des Fabricants du Veritable Camembert de Normandie_ and we agree that this is \"a most useful association for the defense of one of the best cheeses of France.\" Its extremely delicate piquance cannot be matched, except perhaps by Brie.  Napoleon is said to have named it and to have kissed the waitress who first served it to him in the tiny town of Camembert. And there a statue stands today in the market place to honor Marie Harel who made the first Camembert.  Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple, pineapple,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],["title","The Complete Book of Cheese (#2)"],["body",", French \"flute\" or pumpernickel. As-with Brie and with oysters, Camembert should be eaten only in the \"R\" months, and of these September is the best.  Since Camembert rhymes with beware, if you can't get the _véritable_ don't fall for a domestic imitation or any West German abomination such as one dressed like a valentine in a heart-shaped box and labeled \"Camembert--Cheese Exquisite.\" They are equally tasteless, chalky with youth, or choking with ammoniacal gas when old and decrepit.  Cheddar  The English _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_ says:       Cheddar cheese is one of the kings of cheese; it is pale coloured,      mellow, salvy, and, when good, resembling a hazelnut in flavour.      The Cheddar principle pervades the whole cheesemaking districts      of America, Canada and New Zealand, but no cheese imported into      England can equal the Cheddars of Somerset and the West of      Scotland.  Named for a village near Bristol where farmer Joseph Harding first manufactured it, the best is still called Farmhouse Cheddar, but in America we have practically none of this. Farmhouse Cheddar must be ripened at least nine months to a mellowness, and little of our American cheese gets as much as that. Back in 1695 John Houghton wrote that it \"contended in goodness (if kept from two to five years, according to magnitude) with any cheese in England.\"  Today it is called \"England's second-best cheese,\" second after Stilton, of course.  In early days a large cheese sufficed for a year or two of family feeding, according to this old note: \"A big Cheddar can be kept for two years in excellent condition if kept in a cool room and turned over every other day.\"  But in old England some were harder to preserve: \"In Bath... I asked one lady of the larder how she kept Cheddar cheese. Her eyes twinkled: 'We don't keep cheese; we eats it.'\"  Cheshire  A Cheshireman sailed into Spain To trade for merchandise; When he arrived from the main A Spaniard him espies. Who said, \"You English rogue, look here! What fruits and spices fine Our land produces twice a year. Thou has not such in thine.\"  The Cheshireman ran to his hold And fetched a Cheshire cheese, And said, \"Look here, you dog, behold! We have such fruits as these. Your fruits are ripe but twice a year, As you yourself do say, But such as I present you here Our land brings twice a day.\"  Anonymous       Let us pass on to cheese. We have some glorious cheeses, and far      too few people glorying in them. The Cheddar of the inn, of the      chophouse, of the average English home, is a libel on a thing      which, when authentic, is worthy of great honor. Cheshire,      divinely commanded into existence as to three parts to precede      and as to one part to accompany certain Tawny Ports and some      Late-Bottled Ports, can be a thing for which the British Navy      ought to fire a salute on the principle on which Colonel Brisson      made his regiment salute when passing the great Burgundian      vineyard.       T. Earle Welby,       IN \"THE DINNER KNELL\"  Cheshire is not only the most literary cheese in England, but the oldest. It was already manufactured when Caesar conquered Britain, and tradition is that the Romans built the walled city of Chester to control the district where the precious cheese was made. Chester on the River Dee was a stronghold against the Roman invasion.  It came to fame with The Old Cheshire Cheese in Elizabethan times and waxed great with Samuel Johnson presiding at the Fleet Street Inn where White Cheshire was served \"with radishes or watercress or celery when in season,\" and Red Cheshire was served toasted or stewed in a sort of Welsh Rabbit. (_See_ Chapter 5.)  The Blue variety is called Cheshire-Stilton, and Vyvyan Holland, in _Cheddar Gorge_ suggests that \"it was no doubt a cheese of this sort, discovered and filched from the larder of the Queen of Hearts, that accounted for the contented grin on the face of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland.\"  All very English, as recorded in Victor Meusy's couplet:      _Dans le Chester sec et rose     A longues dents, l'Anglais mord._      In the Chester dry and pink     The long teeth of the English sink.  Edam and Gouda      _Edam in Peace and War_  There also coming into the river two Dutchmen, we sent a couple of men on board and brought three Holland cheeses, cost 4d. a piece, excellent cheeses.  Pepys' _Diary_, March 2,1663       Commodore Coe, of the Montevidian Navy, defeated Admiral Brown of      the Buenos Ayrean Navy, in a naval battle, when he used Holland      cheese for cannon balls.       _The Harbinger_ (Vermont), December 11, 1847  The crimson cannon balls of Holland have been heard around the world. Known as \"red balls\" in England and _katzenkopf,_ \"cat's head,\" in Germany, they differ from Gouda chiefly in the shape, Gouda being round but flattish and now chiefly imported as one-pound Baby Goudas.  Edam when it is good is very, very good, but when it is bad it is horrid. Sophisticated ones are sent over already scalloped for the ultimate consumer to add port, and there are crocks of Holland cheese potted with sauterne. Both Edam and Gouda should be well aged to develop full-bodied quality, two years being the accepted standard for Edam.  The best Edams result from a perfect combination of Breed (black-and-white Dutch Friesian) and Feed (the rich pasturage of Friesland and Noord Holland).  The Goudas, shaped like English Derby and Belgian Delft and Leyden, come from South Holland. Some are specially made for the Jewish trade and called Kosher Gouda. Both Edam and Gouda are eaten at mealtimes thrice daily in Holland. A Dutch breakfast without one or the other on black bread with butter and black coffee would be unthinkable. They're also boon companions to plum bread and Dutch cocoa.  \"Eclair Edams\" are those with soft insides.  Emmentaler, Gruyère and Swiss      When the working woman     Takes her midday lunch,     It is a piece of Gruyère     Which for her takes the place of roast.  Victor Meusy  Whether an Emmentaler is eminently Schweizerkäse, grand Gruyère from France, or lesser Swiss of the United States, the shape, size and glisten of the eyes indicate the stage of ripeness, skill of making and quality of flavor. They must be uniform, roundish, about the size of a big cherry and, most important of all, must glisten like the eye of a lass in love, dry but with the suggestion of a tear.  Gruyère does not see eye to eye with the big-holed Swiss Saanen cartwheel or American imitation. It has tiny holes, and many of them; let us say it is freckled with pinholes, rather than pock-marked. This variety is technically called a _niszler_, while one without any holes at all is \"blind.\" Eyes or holes are also called vesicles.  Gruyère Trauben (Grape Gruyère) is aged in Neuchâtel wine in Switzerland, although most Gruyère has been made in France since its introduction there in 1722. The most famous is made in the Jura, and another is called Comté from its origin in Franche-Comté.  A blind Emmentaler was made in Switzerland for export to Italy where it was hardened in caves to become a grating cheese called Raper, and now it is largely imitated there. Emmentaler, in fact, because of its piquant pecan-nut flavor and inimitable quality, is simulated everywhere, even in Switzerland.  Besides phonies from Argentina and countries as far off as Finland, we get a flood of imported and domestic Swisses of all sad sorts, with all possible faults--from too many holes, that make a flabby, wobbly cheese, to too few--cracked, dried-up, collapsed or utterly ruined by molding inside. So it will pay you to buy only the kind already marked genuine in Switzerland. For there cheese such as Saanen takes six years to ripen, improves with age, and keeps forever.  Cartwheels well over a hundred years old are still kept in cheese cellars (as common in Switzerland as wine cellars are in France), and it is said that the rank of a family is determined by the age and quality of the cheese in its larder.   Feta and Casere  The Greeks have a name for it--Feta. Their neighbors call it Greek cheese. Feta is to cheese what Hymettus is to honey. The two together make ambrosial manna. Feta is soft and as blinding white as a plate of fresh Ricotta smothered with sour cream. The whiteness is preserved by shipping the cheese all the way from Greece in kegs sloshing full of milk, the milk being renewed from time to time. Having been cured in brine, this great sheep-milk curd is slightly salty and somewhat sharp, but superbly spicy.  When first we tasted it fresh from the keg with salty milk dripping through our fingers, we gave it full marks. This was at the Staikos Brothers Greek-import store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. We then compared Feta with thin wisps of its grown-up brother, Casere. This gray and greasy, hard and brittle palate-tickler of sheep's milk made us bleat for more Feta.   Gorgonzola  Gorgonzola, least pretentious of the Blues triumvirate (including Roquefort and Stilton) is nonetheless by common consent monarch of all other Blues from Argentina to Denmark. In England, indeed, many epicures consider Gorgonzola greater than Stilton, which is the highest praise any cheese can get there. Like all great cheeses it has been widely imitated, but never equaled. Imported Gorgonzola, when fruity ripe, is still firm but creamy and golden inside with rich green veins running through. Very pungent and highly flavored, it is eaten sliced or crumbled to flavor salad dressings, like Roquefort.   Hablé Crème Chantilly  The name Hablé Crème Chantilly sounds French, but the cheese is Swedish and actually lives up to the blurb in the imported package: \"The overall characteristic is indescribable and delightful freshness.\"  This exclusive product of the Walk Gärd Creamery was hailed by Sheila Hibben in _The New Yorker_ of May 6, 1950, as enthusiastically as Brillat-Savarin would have greeted a new dish, or the"]]]
