They testify to, and may promote, a very widely spread _entente cordiale_, they enhance the prestige of the tribunal of The Hague, and they assure the reference to that tribunal of certain classes of questions which might otherwise give rise to international complications. Beyond this it would surely be unwise to proceed. It is beginning to be realised that what are called \"general\" treaties of arbitration, by which States would bind themselves beforehand to submit to external decision questions which might involve high political issues, will not be made between Powers of the first importance; also, that such treaties, if made, would be more likely to lead to fresh misunderstandings than to secure the peaceful settlement of disputed questions.  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, November 21 (1904).       _Pars._ 1-3.--The topic of \"Commissions of Enquiry,\" which     occupied Arts. 9-13 of the Convention of 1899 \"For the Peaceful     Settlement of International Disputes,\" is more fully dealt with     in Arts. 9-36 of the Convention as amended in 1907.      _Par._ 4.--The amended Convention, as a whole, is still, like     its predecessor, purely facultative. The Russian proposal to     make resort to arbitration universally obligatory in a list of     specified cases, unless when the \"vital interests or national     honour\" of States might be involved, though negatived in 1899,     was renewed in 1907, in different forms, by several Powers,     which eventually concurred in supporting the     Anglo-Portuguese-American proposal, according to which,     differences of a juridical character, and especially those     relating to the interpretation of treaties, are to be submitted     to arbitration, unless they affect the vital interests,     independence, or honour, of the States concerned, or the     interests of third States; while all differences as to the     interpretation of treaties relating to a scheduled list of     topics, or as to the amount of damages payable, where liability     to some extent is undisputed, are to be so submitted without     any such reservation. This proposal was accepted by thirty-two     Powers, but as nine Powers opposed it, and three abstained from     voting, it failed to become a convention. The delegates to the     Conference of 1907 went, however, so far as to include in their     \"Final Act\" a statement to the effect that they were unanimous:     (1) \"in recognising the principle of obligatory arbitration\";     (2) \"in declaring that certain differences, and, in particular,     such as relate to the interpretation and application of the     provisions of International Conventions, are suitable for being     submitted to obligatory arbitration, without any reservations.\"      _Par._ 5.--The Convention between France and Great Britain,     concluded on October 14, 1903, for five years, and renewed in     1908, and again in 1913, for a like period, by which the     parties agree to submit to The Hague tribunal any differences     which may arise between them, on condition \"that they do not     involve either the vital interests, or the independence, or     honour of the two contracting States, and that they do not     affect the interests of a third Power,\" has served as a model     or \"common form,\" for a very large number of conventions to the     same effect, entered into between one State and another. The     Convention of April 11, 1908, between Great Britain and the     United States is substantially of this type.      But see now the three letters which follow.   THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS  Sir,--The League is unquestionably \"a brave design.\" Sympathy with its objects and some hope that they may be realised have induced myself, as, doubtless many others, to abstain from criticising the way in which the topic has been handled by the representatives of the victorious Powers. Recent discussions seem, however, to render such reticence no longer desirable.  It begins to be recognised that, as some of us have all along held to be the case, a serious mistake was made by the Paris delegates when they combined in one and the same document provisions needed for putting an end to an existing state of war with other provisions aiming at the creation in the future of a new supernational society. Two matters so wholly incongruous in character should surely have been dealt with separately. Whether it is now too late to attempt a remedy for the consequences of this unfortunate combination is a question which can be answered only by the diplomatists whose business it is to be intimately in touch with the susceptibilities of the various nations concerned. In the meantime, however, on the assumption that this state of things is productive of regrettable results, I may perhaps venture to indicate, recommending their adoption, the steps which appear to be required for the reformation of the Treaty as drafted. My suggestions would run as follows:--  (1) Subtract from the Treaty of Versailles, Parts I. and XIII., the former constituting a League of Nations, the latter, in pursuance of a recital that universal peace \"can be established only if it is based upon social justice,\" wholly occupied with a sufficiently ambitious scheme for the regulation by the League of all questions relating to \"Labour\" which may arise within its jurisdiction.  (2) Let Part I., with Part XIII. annexed, constitute a new and independent Treaty; to be, as such, submitted to the Powers for further consideration. (The opportunity might be taken of ridding it of all references to a system of \"mandates,\" which might very probably lead to jealousies and misunderstandings.)  (3) Parts II. to XII., XIV., and XV. would then constitute the real Treaty of Peace, in which it would, however, be necessary in the numerous articles attributing functions, for the most part of a temporary character, the \"League of Nations,\" to substitute for any mention of the League words descriptive of some other authority, yet to be created, such as, for instance, \"a Commission to be constituted by the principal Allied and Associated Powers.\"  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, December 16 (1919).   Sir,--Let me assure Lord Robert Cecil that I am perfectly serious in giving expression to a long-felt wish that the Treaty of Peace could be relieved of articles relating exclusively to an as yet to be created League of Nations, and in proceeding to indicate the steps that must be taken if this reform is to be effected.  It can hardly be necessary also to assure Lord Robert that I am fully aware of the formidable, though perhaps not insuperable, difficulties which would beset any efforts to carry out my suggestions. He may have inferred so much from my letter of the 16th, in which, treating the question whether it is now too late to attempt a remedy for the existing state of things as beyond the competence of an outsider, I describe it as one which can be answered \"only by the diplomatists whose business it is to be intimately in touch with the susceptibilities of the various nations concerned.\"  On a point of detail, I am surprised that Lord Robert is unwilling that the contents of Part XIII. should be removed to their natural context, on the ground that the Labour organisation might be annoyed if this were done. I am, however, confident that the organisation is too intelligent not to see that it would lose nothing if the articles in which it is interested were made an integral part of a Convention constituting a League of Nations; the League being already solely charged with giving effect to the articles in question.  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, December 20 (1919).   Sir,--Professor Alison Phillips is not quite accurate in attributing to me a belief that the task of amending the Treaty of Versailles is \"not beyond the powers of competent diplomatists.\" No such belief is expressed in my letter of December 16, in which I was careful to admit that the question, \"whether it is now too late to attempt\" the reform which appears to me to be desirable is one \"which can be answered only by the diplomatists.\"  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, January 5 (1920).         *       *       *       *       *  SECTION 2  _Pacific Reprisals_      The four letters next following were suggested by the ambiguous     character of the blockades instituted by France against Siam in     1893, by the Great Powers against Crete in 1897, and by Great     Britain, Germany, and Italy, against Venezuela in 1902. The     object, in each case, was to explain the true nature of the     species of reprisals known as \"Pacific Blockade,\" and to point     out the difference between the consequences of such a measure     and those which result from a \"Belligerent Blockade.\" A fifth     letter, written with reference to the action of the Netherlands     against Venezuela in 1908, emphasises the desirability of more     clearly distinguishing between war and reprisals. On the     various applications of a blockade in time of peace, see the     author's _Studies in International Law_, pp. 130-150.   THE BLOCKADE OF THE MENAM  Sir,--Upon many questions of fact and of policy involved in the quarrel between France and Siam it may be premature as yet to expect explicit information from the French Government; but there should not be a moment's doubt as to the meaning of the blockade which has probably by this time been established.  Is France at war "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14447"],["title","Letters to \"The Times\" upon War and Neutrality (1881-1920) (#3)"],["body","Siam? This may well be the case, according to modern practice, without any formal declaration of war; and it is, for international purposes, immaterial whether the French Cabinet, if it has commenced a war without the sanction of the Chambers, has or has not thereby violated the French Constitution. If there is a war, and if the blockade, being effective, has been duly notified to the neutral Powers, the vessels of those Powers are, of course, liable to be visited, and, if found to be engaged in breach of the blockade, to be dealt with by the French Prize Courts.  Or is France still at peace with Siam, and merely putting upon her that form of pressure which is known as \"pacific blockade\"?  In this case, since there is no belligerency there is no neutrality, and the ships of States other than that to which the pressure is being applied are not liable to be interfered with. The particular mode of applying pressure without going to war known as \"pacific blockade\" dates, as is well known, only from 1827. It has indeed been enforced, by England as well as by France, upon several occasions, against the vessels of third Powers; but this practice has always been protested against, especially by French jurists, as an unwarrantable interference with the rights of such Powers, and was acknowledged by Lord Palmerston to be illegal. The British Government distinctly warned the French in 1884 that their blockade of Formosa could be recognised as affecting British vessels only if it constituted an act of war against China; and when the Great Powers in 1886 proclaimed a pacific blockade of the coasts of Greece they carefully limited its operation to ships under the Greek flag.  The Subject has been exhaustively considered by the Institut de Droit International, which, at its meeting at Heidelberg in 1887, arrived at certain conclusions which may be taken to express the view of learned Europe. They are as follows:--        \"L'établissement d'un blocus en dehors de l'état de guerre ne       doit être considere comme permis par le droit des gens que       sous les conditions suivantes:--        \"1. Les navires de pavillon étranger peuvent entrer librement       malgré le blocus.        \"2. Le blocus pacifique doit être déclaré et notifié       officiellement, et maintenu par une force suffisante.        \"Les navires de la puissance bloquée qui ne respectent pas un       pareil blocus peuvent être séquestrés. Le blocus ayant cessé,       ils doivent être restitués avec leur cargaisons à leurs       propriétaires, mais sans dédommagement à aucun titre.\"  If the French wish to reap the full advantages of a blockade of the Siamese coast they must be prepared, by becoming belligerent, to face the disadvantages which may result from the performance by this country of her duties as a neutral.  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Athenæum Club, July 26 (1893).   PACIFIC BLOCKADE  Sir,--The letter signed \"M.\" in your issue of this morning contains, I think, some statements which ought not to pass uncorrected. A \"blockade\" is, of course, the denial by a naval squadron of access for vessels to a defined portion of the coasts of a given nation. A \"pacific blockade\" is one of the various methods--generically described as \"reprisals,\" such as \"embargo,\" or seizure of ships on the high seas--by which, without resort to war, pressure, topographically or otherwise limited in extent, may be put upon an offending State. The need for pressure of any kind is, of course, regrettable, the only question being whether such limited pressure be not more humane to the nation which experiences it, and less distasteful to the nation which exercises it, than is the letting loose of the limitless calamities of war.  The opinion of statesmen and jurists upon this point has undergone a change, and this because the practice known as \"pacific blockade\" has itself changed. The practice, which is comparatively modern, dating only from 1827, was at first directed against ships under all flags, and ships arrested for breach of a pacific blockade were at one time confiscated, as they would have been in time of war. It has been purged of these defects as the result of discussions, diplomatic and scientific. As now understood, the blockade is enforced only against vessels belonging to the \"quasi-enemy,\" and even such vessels, when arrested, are not confiscated, but merely detained till the blockade is raised. International law does not stand still; and having some acquaintance with Continental opinion on the topic under consideration, I read with amazement \"M.'s\" assertion that \"the majority in number,\" \"the most weighty in authority\" of the writers on international law \"have never failed to protest against such practices as indefensible in principle.\" The fact is that the objections made by, e.g. Lord Palmerston in 1846, and by several writers of textbooks, to pacific blockade, had reference to the abuses connected with the earlier stages of its development. As directed only against the ships of the \"quasi-enemy,\" it has received the substantially unanimous approbation of the Institut de Droit International at Heidelberg in 1887, after a very interesting debate, in which the advocates of the practice were led by M. Perels, of the Prussian Admiralty, and its detractors by Professor Geffken. It is true that in an early edition of his work upon international law my lamented friend, Mr. Hall, did use the words attributed to him by \"M.\": \"It is difficult to see how a pacific blockade is justifiable.\" But many things, notably Lord Granville's correspondence with France in 1884 and the blockade of the Greek coast in 1886, have occurred since those words were written. If \"M.\" will turn to a later edition of the work in question he will see that Mr. Hall had completely altered his opinion on the subject, or rather that, having disapproved of the practice as unreformed, he blesses it altogether in its later development. With reference to the utility of the practice, I should like to call the attention of \"M.\" to a passage in the latest edition of Hall's book which is perhaps not irrelevant to current politics:--        \"The circumstances of the Greek blockade of 1886 show that       occasions may occur in which pacific blockade has an efficacy       which no other measure would possess. The irresponsible       recklessness of Greece was endangering the peace of the       world; advice and threats had been proved to be useless; it       was not till the material evidence of the blockade was       afforded that the Greek imagination could be impressed with       the belief that the majority of the Great Powers of Europe       were in earnest in their determination that war should be       avoided.\"  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, March 5 (1897).   THE VENEZUELAN CONTROVERSY  Sir,--Apart from the practical difficulty, so ably described by Sir Robert Giffen in your issue of this morning, of obtaining compensation in money from a State which seems to be at once bankrupt and in the throes of revolution, not a few questions of law and policy, as to which misunderstanding is more than probable, are raised from day to day by the action of the joint squadrons in Venezuelan waters. It may therefore be worth while to attempt to disentangle the more important of these questions from the rest, and to indicate in each case the principles involved.  1. Are we at war with Venezuela? Till reading the reports of what passed last night in the House of Commons, I should have replied to this question unhesitatingly in the negative. Most people whose attention has been directed to such matters must have supposed that we were engaged in the execution of \"reprisals,\" the nature and legitimacy of which have long been recognised by international law. They consist, of course, in the exertion of pressure, short of war; over which they possess the following advantages: They are strictly limited in scope; they cease, when their object has been attained, without the formalities of a treaty of peace; and, no condition of \"belligerency\" existing between the Powers immediately concerned, third Powers are not called upon to undertake the onerous obligations of \"neutrality.\" The objection sometimes made to reprisals, that they are applicable only to the weaker Powers, since a strong Power would at once treat them as acts of war, is indeed the strongest recommendation of this mode of obtaining redress. To localise hostile pressure as far as possible, and to give to it such a character as shall restrict its incidence to the peccant State, is surely in the interest of the general good. That the steps taken are such as would probably, between States not unequally matched, cause an outbreak of war cannot render them inequitable in cases where so incalculable an evil is unlikely to follow upon their employment.  2. The justification of a resort either to reprisals or to war, in any given case, depends, of course, upon the nature of the acts complained of, and upon the validity of the excuses put forward either for the acts themselves, or for failure to give satisfaction for them. The British claims against Venezuela seem to fall into three classes. It will hardly be disputed that acts of violence towards British subjects or vessels, committed under State authority, call for redress. Losses by British subjects in the course of civil wars would come next, and would need more careful scrutiny (on this point the debates and votes of the Institut de Droit International, at its meeting at Neuchâtel in 1900, may be consulted with advantage). Last of all would come the claims of unpaid bondholders, as to which Mr. Balfour would seem to endorse, in principle, the statement made in 1880 by Lord Salisbury who, while observing that \"it would be an extreme assertion to say that this country ought never to interfere on the part of bondholders who have been wronged,\" went on to say that \"it"]]]
