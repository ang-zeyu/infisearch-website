And she told him her story. How they had been to the moon in search of Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather, and so on, till the moment when he had met them on the road.  \"Very, very interesting, I am sure,\" he said, \"and I wish I could help you in finding Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather, but I think you must be tired, so if you will lie down here I will sleep outside and protect you from any danger.\"  So Sweetclover and the Villain entered his house, which was very nicely covered with straw and made a very comfortable place to sleep in, and in a few minutes were fast asleep.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER X   In the morning, the sun was shining brightly and looking out of the door of Napoleon's house they were overjoyed to see Kernel Cob walking toward them, for the field in which he had slept was the one next to where Napoleon lived.  You may imagine their joy.  After he had been introduced to Napoleon, they sat down to think what had best be done.  \"I wish I could help you,\" said Napoleon, \"but I am a watch dog and a watch dog may never shirk his duty. I never leave these grounds, for I love my master.\"  \"You have been very kind,\" said Sweetclover, \"and I'm sure we are grateful to you.\"  \"I'll tell you what I can do,\" said Napoleon, whose forehead wrinkled as he thought, \"I can introduce you to a great bird that lives in a field back of me. She is the South American condor and I'm sure she will be able to carry you somewhere.\"  \"All of us?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Why, yes, indeed,\" replied Napoleon, \"she is about ten times as big as you and very strong.\"  \"Oh, goodie,\" said Sweetclover, \"where is she?\"  \"Over there,\" answered Napoleon. \"Just say I sent you and she will do anything for you.\"  So, after thanking Napoleon for his kindness, they walked in the direction he had given them and soon came to a great haystack on the top of which was a large nest.  And Kernel Cob called up to the nest and the bird put out her head.  Kernel Cob then introduced everybody and the bird flew down at once.  \"We are trying to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" he explained, and after he had told her their story, she was so interested that she said she would help them as soon as she had finished her breakfast.  \"Now,\" she said, \"let us start. Where are the motheranfather of these little children?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Kernel Cob. \"They're lost.\"  \"I don't know anything about motheranfathers,\" replied the bird, \"but I know when I lose anything it is because it falls out of my nest.\"  \"People don't live in nests,\" replied Kernel Cob. \"For if they did, and fell out, they would get broken.\"  \"I say!\" said the Villain who had been thinking very deeply. \"Let's look for them near where they were lost.\"  \"That's a good way,\" said Sweetclover. \"Let's go to the United States. How far is it?\"  \"Thousands of miles,\" answered the Condor. \"But that is nothing for me. I can fly that far in a few days. Come, get ready. We will go to the United States. Jump on my back.\"  So they climbed up on the bird's back, and all being ready she flew away.  \"How does she know which way to fly?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"Birds know everything in the air, just the same as fishes do in the water,\" said the Villain.  \"And worms in the ground,\" added Kernel Cob.  \"I guess Dolls must be the stupidest things in the world,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Only some of us,\" said Kernel Cob.  [Illustration]  At this Sweetclover, the Villain and the Condor laughed, but Kernel Cob didn't know what they were laughing at, which was a very good thing for him.  All that day they flew, and were very happy indeed in the warm sunshine skimming through the clouds. And once they went through a rainstorm and got wet; but as the sun came out soon after and dried them quickly they were none the worse for their bath, but felt refreshed for it.  And they passed over the great Amazon river, the largest river in the world, and, much before they knew it, they were in Central America going at a tremendous rate of speed.  \"We shall be in the United States very soon, at this pace,\" said the Villain.  And on the Condor flew, swift as an arrow, but in the afternoon a great wind storm came from the East and she was obliged to turn her course in the direction of the wind, and late in the evening they were nearing a large city which was now visible in the distance.  \"I wish I had wings,\" sighed Sweetclover, \"and could fly all over the world. It would be so wonderful.\"  \"We will rest to-night,\" said the bird, \"and try to find the motheranfather of Jackie and Peggs to-morrow.\"  \"You will be too tired,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Oh, no,\" said the Condor. \"You can have no fear. I will be all right. When I say I do something I do that. I never....\"  She did not finish what she was going to say, and maybe it was a punishment for boasting. People are often punished for talking too much about what they can do ... for just at that moment something dreadful happened that changed their plans.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XI   And what do you think happened to the Condor?  Just as they were coming to the city and the bird was looking back, talking to Kernel Cob and the others, and everything looked so happy and bright....  \"Look out!\" shouted Kernel Cob, but it was too late. Straight ahead was a tall tree, toward which the bird was flying, and from the branches came a puff of smoke and the sharp crack of a gun.  The next instant the Condor stopped flying, and slowly sank to the ground.  \"I am done for,\" she said in a feeble voice. \"It is just the way of all birds. I am sorry that I cannot help you more. Good-bye.\"  By this time she had reached the ground, and Kernel Cob was in a very great rage. He wanted to stay and fight the hunter who would soon come to take the bird, but Sweetclover and the Villain begged him to be prudent and run away, lest they all be captured.  So with great sorrow, they said good-bye to the Condor and hurried away.  From behind a rock, they watched the hunter take up the bird and carry it away.  And our three little friends sat down upon a stone to think.  \"I don't know what to do,\" said Sweetclover. \"We have lost our best friend.\"  \"Never mind,\" said the Villain tenderly, and he put his hand kindly on her shoulder. \"It will all come right in the end. It always does, you know.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" said Sweetclover, \"but you have to go through such terrible things first.\"  \"Well, we got along pretty well before we met the bird,\" said Kernel Cob. \"Didn't we get to the Moon and all that?\"  \"That was because we prayed to the Fairies,\" said Sweetclover.  \"And maybe if we pray now, something will happen to help us.\"  Sweetclover had a very beautiful faith. She believed, as all good people do, that you must put your faith in something good, and then everything will be for the best, no matter what happens.  So they knelt down by the side of the rock and prayed.  \"How do you pray?\" whispered the Villain to Sweetclover. \"I never prayed before in my life.\"  \"Just say, 'Please good, kind Fairies, I am a poor little Villain, and I need your help, and I'll never be bad any more.'\"  So they prayed, and pretty soon along came a team of horses drawing a big wagon packed with boxes of oranges.  And the wagon stopped on the road where they were, and the driver got down to fix the harness of one of the horses.  \"I'm glad that buckle got loose,\" said the horse to his team-mate, \"I was getting tired and needed a rest.\"  \"Hello there, Master Horse,\" shouted Kernel Cob.  \"Who are you?\" neighed the horse.  \"I'm Kernel Cob. Where are you going?\"  \"We're going to the city to pack these oranges on a train,\" was the reply.  \"Here's our chance!\" cried Kernel Cob. \"Come, let us hide in one of these boxes, and we'll get a ride on the train.\"  \"Good idea,\" said the Villain.  So they waited till the man climbed up on his seat again, and shouted, \"get up\" to the horses; then they ran out and got on one of the spokes of the wheel when it was near the ground, and when the wheel turned and the spoke came up to the top, they sprang off onto the wagon and crawled into a box which is called a crate, and is open a little so the oranges do not get too hot and spoil. And it was perfectly safe and very comfortable.  And they must have fallen asleep; for the next thing they knew they felt a rocking and a rocking and Kernel Cob got out of the crate and crawled along till he came to a stairway, and, climbing this, discovered that they were on a ship.  He hurried back to tell his news to Sweetclover and the Villain.  And Sweetclover began to cry.  \"A woman is the crybabiest person in the world,\" said Kernel Cob.  [Illustration]                    NOBLE DEEDS!          If you attempt a noble deed         You're almost certain to succeed,         So do not give up hope, but try,         However rough your path may lie,         To forge ahead with all your might         And everything will come out right.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XII   For many days they sailed on the ship till they came to land. And men came to unload the vessel, and their crate of oranges was carried up on the dock and placed on a wagon, and they were driven off, not in the least knowing what country they were in, nor where they were going.  And they peered out from the crate, and soon they heard the queerest kind of talk they ever heard, and Kernel Cob, bolder than the others, raised his head above an orange but quickly put it down again.  \"I know where we are,\" said the Villain who had been thinking. \"We are in Japan.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"I was here once with the Showman,\" said the Villain, \"and I remember the way the people talked.\"  And,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14110"],["title","Kernel Cob And Little Miss Sweetclover (#5)"],["body","pushed onto a wagon, they were driven outside the city.  \"We mustn't go too far,\" said Sweetclover, \"or we'll never find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather. Let's get out before it's too late.\"  So they climbed out of their hiding place, and jumped to the ground.  They were not far from a house, and a curious kind of a house it was.  \"It looks like the kind of house Jackie used to make with cards,\" said Kernel Cob, and so intent were they, that they did not hear the approach of a little girl until she stood beside them, and lifted Sweetclover in her arms.  Of course they did not understand what she said, but it must have been something very beautiful, for her face was all smiles.  And the little Japanese girl lifted up Kernel Cob, and the Villain, too, and carried them off down the road and into the little house.  A very wonderful house it was, and full of toys, mostly Japanese dolls with short, straight hair and beautiful dresses, and talking all at once, in a curious language.  \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Sweetclover, \"shall we never understand anybody in this strange country?\"  \"Aye, aye sir,\" came a voice at her feet, and looking down, much to her surprise she saw an American Sailor doll.  \"Bless my heart, mates,\" said the sailor, \"I'm glad to see you aboard. I've been in this port these four months, and I haven't heard the sound of the American language in all that time. Shiver my timbers if I'm not glad to set eyes on you.\"  And they talked it all over, where they'd been and everything, all about the Condor and the savages and the Moon.  \"Well, mates,\" said Jackie Tar, for that was his name, \"you've seen a lot but you'll never do any more travelling, for you're in a pretty tight hole this time,\" and he went on to tell them about the Japanese who lived in the house and owned the store.  \"He's a Toy-maker, he is, and the first thing he'll do is to rip you up to see how you're laid together, so he can make more like you.\"  \"Mercy!\" said Sweetclover, and she began to sob.  \"If you're going to begin to cry,\" said Kernel Cob, \"I'm going to give up,\" but the Villain whispered something kindly in Sweetclover's ear, and she stopped at once, for the Villain had more patience, and knew how to comfort her.  [Illustration]  \"Maybe I can help you to escape from here,\" said Jackie Tar, \"and maybe I can't, but I can try. I've had a plan in my mind for a long time but I've had no one to help me but these Japs, and they're not worth the paint on their faces. Are you brave enough to risk it with me?\"  Kernel Cob swelled out his chest and showed his medals, and told Jackie Tar how he had fought the savages single handed.  \"You'll do,\" laughed the sailor, and he told them his plan. \"Do you see that red box over there in the corner?  \"Well, that's a Japanese kite. It goes up into the air very quickly. What I say to do is to climb into the kite, and go up with it. It's a big one and will carry us all.\"  \"Where'll we go to?\" asked the Villain.  \"What care we, as long as we get out of here,\" and he hitched his trousers as real sailors do.  \"Will you do it?\"  \"You bet,\" said Kernel Cob.  So it was agreed that they would go up in the kite, and they moved over to it and tugged at it till they had it in the center of the room. Then a great clatter of talk arose from all the Japanese dolls, which sounded like a lot of chickens calling for their dinner; but Kernel Cob and Jackie Tar and the Villain and Sweetclover paid no heed to them, but only tugged the harder till they had the kite out into the middle of the road.  \"There are just four of us,\" said Jackie Tar. \"Each man tar to a corner. Quick! All aboard,\" and it was all they could do to hold down the kite.  \"Stand by to get the ship under way. Up anchor. Heave ho, lads. Heave ho.\"  But at that moment....     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XIII   The little Japanese girl returned, pulling her father down the road.  The little old man was waving his arms about fiercely and shouting, \"Zaca sakasaka,\" and before the kite had risen from the ground he had reached it, and the next moment Kernel Cob, Sweetclover, the Villain and Jackie Tar were being carried into the toy-shop.  \"Did you ever see such luck in all your life?\" grumbled Kernel Cob.  \"I might have known it was Friday,\" said Jackie Tar, for sailors are very superstitious.  \"Never mind,\" said the Villain, \"we'll get away another day.\"  \"Oh, let us hope so,\" said Sweetclover, \"for I don't want to be ripped apart by that bad Japanese.\"  \"Well, that's what the toy-maker will do if you don't escape him,\" said Jackie Tar, and his eyes would have bulged if they had been real ones instead of just painted.  \"Why doesn't he rip you apart?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Because I'm made of wood. I haven't got any stuffings,\" said Jackie Tar.  By this time the four had been laid upon the floor, and the Japanese dolls had started a great clatter of talk. The little girl picked up Sweetclover and was smoothing out her ruffled dress when the Toy-maker took up a pair of scissors and grabbed up Kernel Cob, before he could draw his sword.  But at that moment the Fairies must have heard Sweetclover's prayer, for I am sure she must have uttered one when her beloved Kernel Cob was so near to being cut apart.  The door opened, and in walked a man, a woman, and a little girl. And they were Americans, too, for the first thing Sweetclover heard was the little girl saying:  \"Mother dear, I do so want a dollie.\"  \"Dorothy wants a doll, John,\" said the little girl's mother.  \"Very well,\" said John, and turning to the Toy-maker said:  \"You sell doll?\"  \"Me sell him very plenty doll,\" answered the Toy-maker.  \"How much for this one?\" asked the man, picking up a little Japanese doll.  But the little girl had seen Kernel Cob in the Toy-maker's hand, and clapping her hands joyfully said:  \"Oh, Dad, may I have this one? I think he's so cunning.\"  \"How much?\" asked Dorothy's father.  \"Him cost two yen.\"  \"Let's see, that's one dollar.\"  \"All right,\" and he took Kernel Cob, and gave the money to the Toy-maker.  Now you may be sure that Sweetclover's heart fell, when she heard this, and thought of being separated from Kernel Cob, and I am quite sure that she prayed very hard to the Fairies; for at that moment the little Japanese girl dropped her, and this caused Dorothy to see what had fallen, and, when she saw Sweetclover, she ran and picked her up.  \"Oh!\" she cried with pleasure. \"Isn't she lovely. May I have her too?\"  \"Why, I suppose so,\" said her father. \"If she doesn't cost too much.\"  [Illustration]  \"Him allee same cost like soldier doll,\" explained the Toy-maker.  \"Very well,\" said Dorothy's father, \"we'll take him too,\" and he gave the Toy-maker the money.  Sweetclover's heart was beating high with happiness; but suddenly there came into her mind the thought of leaving the Villain; her good, thoughtful friend, who had so often consoled her in her troubles, and her heart fell again. Oh, if she could only talk to little Dorothy and beg her to take the Villain and Jackie Tar; but this she could not do so she prayed to the Fairies instead and at once her prayer was heard; for the Toy-maker, who had a very good business head on his shoulders, ran to the door as Dorothy and her parents were going out and called to them:  \"Little girl want nice Pirate and Sailor feller? Allee same price like other doll.\"  And Dorothy's father, being a very kind father indeed, and just the right kind of father for every little girl to have, bought them and Dorothy went down the road with the four dolls under her arms.  And you may be sure that Sweetclover was happy, for they had not only escaped being ripped apart, but were all together, safe and sound.  And Dorothy and her parents went to their hotel in the city, and Dorothy played with her new dolls till her mother came to her and said:  \"Dorothy, dear, we must pack our things for we are going to China this afternoon.\"  But a great misfortune happened, for when Dorothy's parents arrived in China they were in a great hurry to leave the dock, where the boat landed, and Dorothy, who had fallen asleep, forgot her dolls, and left them on a bench in the waiting room, and before Kernel Cob or Jackie Tar or the Villain or Sweetclover could catch up to her, she had been lifted into her mother's arms and had disappeared in the crowd.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XIV   \"Well,\" said Jackie Tar, \"Here we are in China.\" \"I don't see any cups and saucers,\" said Kernel Cob, looking about the streets. \"All I can see is a lot of women with hair hanging down their backs.\"  \"Those are men--Chinamen,\" explained Jackie Tar, for sailors travel all about and know pretty nearly everything about the people of the world.  \"Well, if they are men,\" said Kernel Cob, \"they ought to have their hair cut, and look like men. And if Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather look like these Chinamen, I don't want to find them at all, for I think a child is better off _without_ parents than having two mothers.\"  \"I wish we had never come here at all,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Never mind,\" said the Villain, \"we will find a way to get out of here.\"  \"Leave it to me,\" said Jackie Tar. \"I've been about this old world enough to know how to manage things.\"  But much as he had been about, he didn't count on the things that happen when you least expect them, for just at that moment, and without any warning, they were picked up by a little Chinese boy who carried them home.  \"This must be the thirteenth of the month,\" said Jackie Tar, for you know that people think that the number thirteen brings bad luck.  But it wasn't the thirteenth as you will presently see, for it was a very lucky day indeed for our little friends.  And they were played with by the little Chinese boy, and, when it came time to go to bed, he took the little dolls with him and for once they were fed a very enjoyable supper of rice and milk, a food which Jackie Tar and the Villain liked, but Kernel Cob said it needed raisins and more sugar,"]]]
