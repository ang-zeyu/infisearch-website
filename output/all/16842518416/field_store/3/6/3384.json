I had presence of mind; near me was a rock; I stood upon it. The fiery torrent was vomited out and streamed on either side of me. And through that long and terrible night I stood there alone upon that rock, the glowing, fiery lava on every hand--a monument of the long-suffering and tender providence of the Lord, who spared me that I might this day testify in your ears of Him.  “Now, my dear friends, let us deduce the lessons that are to be learnt from this narrative.  “Firstly: let us never commit suicide. The man is a fool, my friends, that man is insane, my friends, who would leave this earth, my friends. Here are joys innumerable, such as it hath not entered into the heart of man to understand, my friends. Here are clothes, my friends; here are beds, my friends; here is delicious food, my friends. Our precious bodies were given us to love, to cherish. Oh, let us do so! Oh, let us never hurt them; but care for and love them, my friends!”  Every one was impressed, and Bonaparte proceeded:  “Thirdly; let us not love too much. If that young man had not loved that young woman, he would not have jumped into Mount Etna. The good men of old never did so. Was Jeremiah ever in love, or Ezekiel, or Hosea, or even any of the minor prophets? No. Then why should we be? Thousands are rolling in that lake at this moment who would say, ‘It was love that brought us here.’ Oh, let us think always of our own souls first.       “‘A charge to keep I have,          A God to glorify;        A never-dying soul to save,          And fit it for the sky.’  “Oh, beloved friends, remember the little boy and the meiboss; remember the young girl and the young man; remember the lake, the fire, and the brimstone; remember the suicide’s skeleton on the pitchy billows of Mount Etna; remember the voice of warning that has this day sounded in your ears; and what I say to you I say to all--watch! May the Lord add his blessings!”  Here the Bible closed with a tremendous thud. Tant Sannie loosened the white handkerchief about her neck and wiped her eyes, and the coloured girl, seeing her do so, sniffled. She did not understand the discourse, which made it the more affecting.  There hung over it that inscrutable charm which hovers forever for the human intellect over the incomprehensible and shadowy. When the last hymn was sung the German conducted the officiator to Tant Sannie, who graciously extended her hand, and offered coffee and a seat on the sofa. Leaving him there, the German hurried away to see how the little plum-pudding he had left at home was advancing; and Tant Sannie remarked that it was a hot day. Bonaparte gathered her meaning as she fanned herself with the end of her apron. He bowed low in acquiescence. A long silence followed. Tant Sannie spoke again. Bonaparte gave her no ear; his eye was fixed on a small miniature on the opposite wall, which represented Tant Sannie as she had appeared on the day before her confirmation, fifteen years before, attired in green muslin. Suddenly he started to his feet, walked up to the picture, and took his stand before it. Long and wistfully he gazed into its features; it was easy to see that he was deeply moved. With a sudden movement, as though no longer able to restrain himself, he seized the picture, loosened it from its nail, and held it close to his eyes. At length, turning to the Boer-woman, he said, in a voice of deep emotion:  “You will, I trust, dear madam, excuse this exhibition of my feelings; but this--this little picture recalls to me my first and best beloved, my dear departed wife, who is now a saint in heaven.”  Tant Sannie could not understand; but the Hottentot maid, who had taken her seat on the floor beside her mistress, translated the English into Dutch as far as she was able.  “Ah, my first, my beloved!” he added, looking tenderly down at the picture. “Oh, the beloved, the beautiful lineaments! My angel wife! This is surely a sister of yours, madame?” he added, fixing his eyes on Tant Sannie.  The Dutchwoman blushed, shook her head, and pointed to herself.  Carefully, intently, Bonaparte looked from the picture in his hand to Tant Sannie’s features, and from the features back to the picture. Then slowly a light broke over his countenance, he looked up, it became a smile; he looked back at the miniature, his whole countenance was effulgent.  “Ah, yes; I see it now,” he cried, turning his delighted gaze on the Boer-woman; “eyes, mouth, nose, chin, the very expression!” he cried. “How is it possible I did not notice it before?”  “Take another cup of coffee,” said Tant Sannie. “Put some sugar in.”  Bonaparte hung the picture tenderly up, and was turning to take the cup from her hand, when the German appeared, to say that the pudding was ready and the meat on the table.  “He’s a God-fearing man, and one who knows how to behave himself,” said the Boer-woman as he went out at the door. “If he’s ugly, did not the Lord make him? And are we to laugh at the Lord’s handiwork? It is better to be ugly and good than pretty and bad; though of course it’s nice when one is both,” said Tant Sannie, looking complacently at the picture on the wall.  In the afternoon the German and Bonaparte sat before the door of the cabin. Both smoked in complete silence--Bonaparte with a book in his hands and his eyes half closed; the German puffing vigorously, and glancing up now and again at the serene blue sky overhead.  “Supposing--you--you, in fact, made the remark to me,” burst forth the German suddenly, “that you were looking for a situation.”  Bonaparte opened his mouth wide, and sent a stream of smoke through his lips.  “Now supposing,” said the German--“merely supposing, of course--that some one, some one, in fact, should make an offer to you, say, to become schoolmaster on their farm and teach two children, two little girls, perhaps, and would give you forty pounds a year, would you accept it? Just supposing, of course.”  “Well, my dear friend,” said Bonaparte, “that would depend on circumstances. Money is no consideration with me. For my wife I have made provision for the next year. My health is broken. Could I meet a place where a gentleman would be treated as a gentleman I would accept it, however small the remuneration. With me,” said Bonaparte, “money is no consideration.”  “Well,” said the German, when he had taken a whiff or two more from his pipe, “I think I shall go up and see Tant Sannie a little. I go up often on Sunday afternoon to have a general conversation, to see her, you know. Nothing--nothing particular, you know.”  The old man put his book into his pocket, and walked up to the farmhouse with a peculiarly knowing and delighted expression of countenance.  “He doesn’t suspect what I’m going to do,” soliloquized the German; “hasn’t the least idea. A nice surprise for him.”  The man whom he had left at his doorway winked at the retreating figure with a wink that was not to be described.    Chapter 1.VI. Bonaparte Blenkins Makes His Nest.  “Ah, what is the matter?” asked Waldo, stopping at the foot of the ladder with a load of skins on his back that he was carrying up to the loft. Through the open door in the gable little Em was visible, her feet dangling from the high bench on which she sat. The room, once a storeroom, had been divided by a row of mealie bags into two parts--the back being Bonaparte’s bedroom, the front his schoolroom.  “Lyndall made him angry,” said the girl tearfully; “and he has given me the fourteenth of John to learn. He says he will teach me to behave myself when Lyndall troubles him.”  “What did she do?” asked the boy.  “You see,” said Em, hopelessly turning the leaves, “whenever he talks she looks out at the door, as though she did not hear him. Today she asked him what the signs of the Zodiac were, and he said he was surprised that she should ask him; it was not a fit and proper thing for little girls to talk about. Then she asked him who Copernicus was; and he said he was one of the Emperors of Rome, who burned the Christians in a golden pig, and the worms ate him up while he was still alive. I don’t know why,” said Em plaintively, “but she just put her books under her arm and walked out; and she will never come to his school again, she says, and she always does what she says. And now I must sit here every day alone,” said Em, the great tears dropping softly.  “Perhaps Tant Sannie will send him away,” said the boy, in his mumbling way, trying to comfort her.  “No,” said Em, shaking her head; “no. Last night when the little Hottentot maid was washing her feet, he told her he liked such feet, and that fat women were so nice to him; and she said I must always put pure cream in his coffee now. No; he’ll never go away,” said Em dolorously.  The boy put down his skins and fumbled in his pocket, and produced a small piece of paper containing something. He stuck it out toward her.  “There, take it for you,” he said. This was by way of comfort.  Em opened it and found a small bit of gum, a commodity prized by the children; but the great tears dropped down slowly on to it.  Waldo was distressed. He had cried so much in his morsel of life that tears in another seemed to burn him.  “If,” he said, stepping in awkwardly and standing by the table, “if you will not cry I will tell you something--a secret.”  “What is that?” asked Em, instantly becoming decidedly better.  “You will tell it to no human being?”  “No.”  He bent nearer to her, and with deep solemnity said:  “I have made a machine!”  Em opened her eyes.  “Yes; a machine for shearing sheep. It is almost done,” said the boy. “There is only one thing that is not right yet; but it will be soon. When you think, and think, and think, all night and all day, it comes at last,” he added mysteriously.  “Where is it?”  “Here! I always carry it here,” said the boy, putting his hand to his breast, where a bulging-out was visible. “This is a model.

WRIGHT  NEW YORK  GEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY     COPYRIGHT, 1922,  BY GEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY    THE CHILDREN'S SIX MINUTES. II  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA     TO  HARRIET ELIZABETH AND ROBERT     INTRODUCTION   For many years it has been my custom to give, every Sunday morning, a brief sermon to the boys and girls of my congregation. This sermon is never more than six minutes, often only three. As a result there has been a growing attendance of young people at our morning worship. They are thus made to feel that they are wanted, and have a part in the Church which all too often is looked upon as a Church solely for the grownups. No part of my ministry has given me greater delight and satisfaction than the thought that I am helping to establish in the lives of many boys and girls that habit so indispensable to a steady Christian experience, namely--the habit of Sunday morning worship.  The Memory Texts and Memory Hymns, from the Methodist Episcopal Hymnal, suggested with each sermon are given for the reason that girls and boys gladly do memory work if it is definitely assigned them.

The morning of the first day of every year we enter into a contest. We see who will be the first to give that day's greeting. Before I was awake this morning my boy ran into my room shouting, \"Happy New Year! Happy New Year!\" He won in the contest.  Now, however, you are in Church and it is not proper for you to speak out loud, so I am able to get ahead of you. A Happy New Year to you, every one.  Well, what will make this year a happy year for you? I will tell you. Let us take this word Happy, and instead of writing it across the page let us write it straight up and down.  H stands for Helpful. You cannot have a happy year unless you are helpful. He who does not try to be helpful is never very happy.  A for Active. I want your year to be full of activity. I hope you will be able to skate and slide down hill many days this winter, and that you will enter into all the spring and summer sports with zest and joy.  P for Playful. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You will want to do something other than play, of course. You will have some home responsibilities, but sandwiched in with the work may there be a good measure of play.  P for Purposeful. Yes, early hi life you should form a purpose. Two questions will help you gain that purpose. 1st--What is it that I want to do? 2nd--What is it that God wants me to do?  Y for Youth.      Helpful     Active     Playful     Purposeful     Youth.  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 19: 14      \"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be     acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.\"  MEMORY HYMN, [572]      _\"Break, newborn year, on glad eyes break.\"_     GROWTH   This second Sunday morning of the New Year I desire to talk to you about growth. The most important holiday afterthought is the thought of growth. You are going to grow every day of this year. Whenever I see a boy on his way to school, or on the field or gymnasium floor, running, romping, playing, I say to myself, \"Can it be possible that this restless, energetic lad was ever a quiet, helpless little babe in the cradle!\" Yes, he was, but he has grown, and he is going to keep right on growing.  It was said of the boy Jesus, \"He grew.\" His growth was natural. There was nothing of precociousness in the childhood of Jesus. He grew, just as every boy grows.      \"A simple-hearted child was he,     And he was nothing more;     In summer days, like you and me,     He played about the door,     Or gathered, where the father toiled,     The shavings from the floor.\"  His growth continued. It did not stop with childhood, but right on through boyhood, youth and manhood he kept growing. Best of all his growth was balanced. He grew physically, mentally and spiritually. He had a sound body. He loved the out-of-doors. He companionshiped much with nature. Most of his graphic illustrations were taken from living, growing things. He talked, almost chiefly, about seeds, grain, harvests, trees, birds and living waters. Boys and girls, strive to grow. Be like your Master who grew inward, outward, and upward; selfward, manward, and Godward. \"How can I grow?\" you ask. I will tell you by passing on to you the secret as given by Maltbie Babcock.      Go     Right     On     Working  MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 2: 40      \"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with     wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.\"  MEMORY HYMN [681]      _\"Brightly gleams our banner.\"_     SNOW   \"Goody, goody, it's snowing!\" This is what I heard early yesterday morning. I think there were many other homes in which this shout of joy ushered in the day. It being Saturday the day was mostly free for playing in the snow. What did you do? You made a snow man. You built a snow fort or house. You had a snowball battle. You slid down hill. You played fox and geese, tracking one another across white fields and through the woods. You had a happy, wonderful day, I know you did.  Have you ever thought how snow is made, and whence it comes? It is formed high in the air, from vapor, and comes down from the clouds, just like rain. Snowdrops are like people in one respect, no two are alike. If you will look at the snowflakes through a magnifying glass you will see a great variety of shapes. And all of them are beautiful. We talk about the sparkling beauty of diamonds and other precious gems; crystal snowflakes are more beautiful by far. If only we could keep them from melting what a necklace or a setting for a ring a collection of snowflakes would make!  God's love is shown to us in the snow. For a fall of snow is like a great blanket, covering the tender roots and seeds, keeping them from freezing, assuring us of another harvest. As to-day you walk home through the snow let it speak to you of your Father's love.  MEMORY VERSE, _Job 38: 22_      \"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?\"  MEMORY HYMN [355]      _\"Love divine, all loves excelling.\"_     KINDNESS   One day last week I saw a huge pair of bobs, heavily loaded with coal, being pulled up the street by two big, fine-looking horses. There were two men on the load. Their faces were black, but it was the dirt of honest toil, it was coal dust. They stopped the horses in front of the house directly across the street from me. I watched them with interest. The first thing one of the men did was to get down, take a board, go around to the front of the horses, lift up the heavy wagon tongue, place the board underneath it as a brace that the necks of the horses might be relieved of the strain of the wagon tongue. At the same time the other man took two warm blankets and covered the horses with them, tucking in the corners beneath the harness to make them tight and warm. Then the men set to work to carry the coal, basket by basket, into the cellar. That was kindness, was it not, to see that the horses were so well cared for on a cold winter day!  To my mind one of the finest acts of our city government is the way we are taught kindness to dumb animals and birds, by permitting them to make their homes and nests in the public park. What a delight it is to walk through the park and have the squirrels come running up so close, to eat from one's hand! That is kindness.  How about kindness to people?
