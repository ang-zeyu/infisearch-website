She defeats me easily.\"  \"I--never saw any one could beat me at _jeu des dames_,\" said John. It was a fine chance to get even with Leila for the humiliating adventures of a not very flattering day.  \"Well, take care,\" said the Squire, not altogether amused. \"Come, Ann.\" Entering the large library room he closed the door, drew over it a curtain, filled his pipe but did not light it, and sat down at the fire beside his wife.  \"Well, James,\" she said, \"did you ever see a better mannered lad, and so intelligent?\"  \"Never--nor any lad who has as good an opinion of his small self. He is too young for his years, and in some ways too old. I looked him over a bit. He is a mere scaffolding, a sickly-looking chap. He eats too little. I heard him remark to you that potatoes disagreed with him and that he never ate apples.\"  \"But, James, what shall we do with him? It is a new and a difficult responsibility.\"  \"Do with him? Oh! make a man of him. Give him and Leila a week's holiday. Turn him loose with that fine tom-boy. Then he must go to school to Mark Rivers with Leila and those two young village imps, the doctor's boy and Grace's, that precious young Baptist. They will do him good. When Mark reports, we shall see further. That is all my present wisdom, Ann. Has the _Tribune_ come? Oh! I see--it is on the table.\"  Ann was still in some doubt and returned to the boy. \"And where do I come in?\"  \"Feed the young animal and get the tailor in the village to make him some warm rough clothes, and get him boots for the snow--and thick gloves--and a warm ready-made overcoat.\"  \"I will. But, James, Leila will half kill him. He is so thin and pale. He looks hardly older than she does.\" Then Ann rose, saying, \"Well, we shall see, I suppose you are right,\" and after some talk about the iron-works left him to his pipe.  When she returned to the hall, the two children were talking of Europe--or rather Leila was listening. \"Well,\" said the little lady, Ann Penhallow, \"how did the game go, John?\"  \"I am rather out of practice,\" said John. Leila said nothing. He had been shamefully worsted. \"I think I shall go to bed,\" he remarked, looking at his watch.  \"I would,\" she said. \"There are the candles. There is a bathroom next to you.\"  He was tired and disgusted, but slept soundly. When at breakfast he said that he was not allowed tea or coffee, he was fed with milk, to which with hot bread and new acquaintance with griddle cakes he took kindly. After breakfast he was driven to the village with his aunt and equipped with a rough ready-made overcoat and high boots. He found the dress comfortable, but not to his taste.  When he came back, the Squire and Leila had disappeared and he was left to his own devices. He was advised by his aunt to walk about and see the stables and the horses. That any boy should not want to see the horses was inconceivable in this household. He did go out and walk on the porch, but soon went in chilled and sat down to lose himself in a book of polar travel. He liked history, travel and biographies of soldiers, fearfully desiring to have his own courage tested--a more common boy-wish than might be supposed. He thought of it as he laid down the book and began to inspect again the painted buffalo skins on the wall, letting his imagination wander when once more he touched a Sioux tomahawk with its grim adornment of scalp-locks. He was far away when he heard his aunt say, \"You were not out long, John. Did they show you the horses?\"  Shy and reserved in novel surroundings, he was rather too much at his ease amid socially familiar things, and now said lightly that he had not seen the stables. \"Really, Aunt Ann, I prefer to read or to look at these interesting Indian relics.\"  \"Ask your uncle about them,\" she said, \"but you will find out that horses are important in this household.\" She left him with the conviction that James Penhallow was, on the whole, right as to the educational needs of this lad.  After lunch his uncle said, \"Leila will show you about the place. You will want to see the horses, of course, and the dogs.\"  \"And my guinea pigs,\" added Leila.  He took no interest in either, and the dogs somewhat alarmed him. His cousin, a little discouraged, led him away into the woods where the ancient pines stood snow laden far apart with no intrusion between them of low shrubbery. Leila was silent, half aware that he was hard to entertain, and then mischievously wilful to give this indifferent cousin a lesson. Presently he stood still, looking up at the towering cones of the motionless pines.  \"How stately they are--how like old Vikings!\" he said. His imagination was the oldest mental characteristic of this over-guarded, repressed boyhood.  Leila turned, surprised. This was beyond her appreciative capacity. \"Once I heard Uncle Jim say something like that. He's queer about trees. He talks to them sometimes just like that. There's the biggest pine over there--I'll show it to you. Why! he will stop and pat it and say, 'How are you?'--Isn't it funny?\"  \"No, it isn't funny at all. It's--it's beautiful!\"  \"You must be like him, John.\"  \"I--like him! Do you think so?\" He was pleased. The Indian horseman of the plains who could talk to the big tree began to be felt by the boy as somehow nearer.  \"Let's play Indian,\" said Leila. \"I'll show you.\" She was merry, intent on mischief.  \"Oh! whatever you like.\" He was uninterested.  Leila said, \"You stand behind this tree, I will stand behind that one.\" She took for herself the larger shelter. \"Then you, each of us, get ready this way a pile of snowballs. I say, Make ready! Fire! and we snowball one another like everything. The first Indian that's hit, he falls down dead. Then the other rushes at him and scalps him.\"  \"But,\" said John, \"how can he?\"  \"Oh! he just gives your hair a pull and makes believe.\"  \"I see.\"  \"Then we play it five times, and each scalp counts one. Now, isn't that real jolly?\"  John had his doubts as to this, but he took his place and made some snowballs clumsily.  \"Make ready! Fire!\" cried Leila. The snowballs flew. At last, the girl seeing how wildly he threw exposed herself. A better shot took her full in the face. Laughing gaily, she dropped, \"I'm dead.\"  The game pleased him with its unlooked-for good luck. \"Now don't stand there like a ninny--scalp me,\" she cried.  He ran to her side and knelt down. The widespread hair affected him curiously. He touched it daintily, let it fall, and rose. \"To pull at a girl's hair! I couldn't do it.\"  Leila laughed. \"A good pull, that's how to scalp.\"  \"I couldn't,\" said John.  \"Well, you are a queer sort of Indian!\" She was less merciful, but in the end, to her surprise, he had three scalps. \"Uncle Jim will laugh when I tell him,\" she said. \"Shall we go home?\"  \"No, I want to see Uncle Jim's big tree.\"  \"Oh! he's only Uncle Jim to me. Aunt don't like it. He will tell you some day to call him Uncle Jim. He says I got that as brevet rank the day my mare refused the barnyard fence and pitched me off. I just got on again and made her take it! That's why he's Uncle Jim.\"  John became thoughtful about that brevet privilege of a remote future. He had, however, persistent ways. \"I want to see the big pine, Leila.\"  \"Oh! come on then. It's a long way. We must cut across.\" He followed her remorselessly swift feet through the leafless bushes and drifts until they came upon a giant pine in a wide space cleared to give the veteran royal solitude. \"That's him,\" cried Leila, and carelessly cast herself down on the snow.  The boy stood still in wonder. Something about the tree disturbed him emotionally. With hands clasped behind his back, he stared up at its towering heights. He was silent.  \"What's the matter? What do you see?\" She was never long silent. He was searching for a word.  \"It's solemn. I like it.\" He moved forward and patted the huge hole with a feeling of reverence and affection. \"I wish he could speak to us. How are you, old fellow?\"  Leila watched him. As yet she had no least comprehension of this sense of being kindred to nature. It is rare in youth. As he spoke, a little breeze stirred the old fellow's topmost crest and a light downfall of snow fell on the pair. Leila laughed, but the boy cried, \"There! he has answered. We are friends.\"  \"Now, if that isn't Uncle Jim all over. He just does make me laugh.\"  John shook off the snow. \"Let's go home,\" he said. He Was warm and red with the exercise, and in high good-humour over his success. \"Did you never read a poem called 'The Talking Oak'? I had a tutor used to read it to me.\"  \"Now, the idea of a tree talking!\" she said. \"No, I never heard of it. Come along, we'll be late. That's funny about a tree talking. Can you run?\"  They ran, but not far, because deep snow makes running hard. It was after dark when they tramped on to the back porch. John's experience taught him to expect blame for being out late. No one asked a question or made a remark. He was ignored, to his amazement. Whether, as he soon learned, he was in or out, wet or dry, seemed to be of no moment to any one, provided he was punctual at meal-times. It was at first hard to realize the reasonable freedom suddenly in his possession. The appearance of complete want of interest in his health and what he did was as useful a moral tonic as was for the body the educational out-of-doors' society of the fearless girl, his aunt's niece whom he was told to consider as his cousin. To his surprise, he was free to come and go, and what he or Leila did in the woods or in the stables no one inquired. Aunt Ann uneasy would have known all about them, but the Squire urged, that for a time, \"let alone\" was the better policy. This freedom was so unusual, so unreservedly complete, as to rejoice Leila, who was very ready to use the liberty it gave. In a week the rector's school would shut them up for half of the day of sunlit snow. Meanwhile, John wondered with interest every morning"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14153"],["title","Westways: A Village Chronicle (#4)"],["body","next those thin active young legs would lead him.  The dogs he soon took to, when Leila's whistle called them,--a wild troop, never allowed beyond the porch or in the house. For some occult reason Mrs. Ann disliked dogs and liked cats, which roamed the house at will and were at deadly feud with the stable canines. No rough weather ever disturbed Leila's out-of-door habits, but when for two days a lazy rain fell and froze on the snow, John declared that he could not venture to get wet with his tendency to tonsilitis. As Leila refused indoor society and he did not like to be left alone, he missed the gay and gallant little lady, and still no one questioned him. On the third day at breakfast Leila was wildly excited. The smooth ice-mailed snow shone brilliant in the sunshine.  \"Coasting weather, Uncle Jim,\" Leila said.  \"First class,\" said her uncle. \"Get off before the sun melts the crust.\"  \"Do be careful, dear,\" said Ann Penhallow, \"and do not try the farm hill.\"  \"Yes, aunt.\" The Squire exchanged signal glances with Leila over the teacup he was lifting. \"Come, John,\" she said. \"No dogs to-day. It's just perfect. Here's your sled.\"  John had seen coasting in Germany and had been strictly forbidden so perilous an amusement. As they walked over the crackling ice-cover of the snow, he said, \"Why do you want to sled, Leila? I consider it extremely dangerous. I saw two persons hurt when we were in Switzerland.\" His imagination was predicting all manner of disaster, but he had the moral courage which makes hypocrisy impossible. From the hill crest John looked down the long silvery slope and did not like it. \"It's just a foolish risk. Do you mean to slide down to that brook?\"  \"Slide! We coast, we don't slide. I think you had better go back and tell Uncle Jim you were afraid.\"  He was furious. \"I tell you this, Miss Grey--I am afraid--I have been told--well, never mind--that--well---I won't say I'm not afraid--but I'm more afraid of Uncle James than--than--of death.\"  She stood still a moment as she faced him, the two pair of blue eyes meeting. He was very youthful for his years and was near the possibility of the tears of anger, and, too, the virile qualities of his race were protesting forces in the background of undeveloped character. The sweet girl face grew red and kinder. \"I was mean, John Penhallow. I am sorry I was rude.\"  \"No--no,\" he exclaimed, \"it was I who was--was--ill-mannered. I--mean to coast if I die.\"  \"Die,\" she laughed gaily. \"Let me go first.\"  \"Go ahead then.\" She was astride of the sled and away down the long descent, while he watched her swift flight. He set his teeth and was off after her. A thrill of pleasure possessed him, the joy of swift movement. Near the foot was an abrupt fall to a frozen brook and then a sharp ascent. He rolled over at Leila's feet seeing a firmament of stars and rose bewildered.  \"Busted?\" cried Leila, who picked up the slang of the village boys to her aunt's disgust.  \"I am not what you call busted,\" said John, \"but I consider it most disagreeable.\" Without a word more he left her, set out up the hill and coasted again. He upset half-way down, rolled over, and got on again laughing. This time somehow he got over the brook and turned crossly on Leila with, \"I hope now you are satisfied, Miss Grey.\"  \"You'll do, I guess,\" said she. \"I just wondered if you would back out, John. Let's try the other hills.\" He went after her vexed at her way of ordering him about, and not displeased with John Penhallow and his new experience in snatching from danger a fearful joy.     CHAPTER III   The difficult lessons on the use of snow-shoes took up day after day, until weary but at last eager he followed her tireless little figure far into the more remote woods. \"What's that?\" he said.  \"I wanted you to see it, John.\" It was an old log cabin. \"That's where the first James Penhallow lived. Uncle Jim keeps it from tumbling to pieces, but it's no use to anybody.\"  \"The first Penhallow,\" said John. \"It must be very old.\"  \"Oh! I suppose so--I don't know--ask Uncle Jim. They say the Indians attacked it once--that first James Penhallow and his wife fought them till help came. I thought you would like to see it.\"  He went in, kicking off his snow-shoes. She was getting used to his silences, and now with some surprise at his evident interest followed him. He walked about making brief remarks or eagerly asking questions.  \"They must have had loop-holes to shoot. Did they kill any Indians?\"  \"Yes, five. They are buried behind the cabin. Uncle Jim set a stone to mark the place.\"  He made no reply. His thoughts were far away in time, realizing the beleaguered cabin, the night of fear, the flashing rifles of his ancestors. The fear--would he have been afraid?  \"When I was little, I was afraid to come here alone,\" said the girl.  \"I should like to come here at night,\" he returned.  \"Why? I wouldn't. Oh! not at night. I don't see what fun there would be in that.\"  \"Then I would know--\"  \"Know what, John? What would you know?\"  \"Oh! no matter.\" He had a deep desire to learn if he would be afraid. \"Some day,\" he added, \"I will tell you. Let's go home.\"  \"Are you tired?\"  \"I'm half dead,\" he laughed as he slipped on his snow-shoes.  A long and heavy rain cleared away the snow, and the more usual softness of the end of November set in. Their holiday sports were over for a time, to John's relief. On a Monday he went through the woods with Leila to the rectory. Mark Rivers, who had only seen John twice, made him welcome. The tall, thin, pale man, with the quiet smile and attentive grey eyes, made a ready capture of the boy. There were only two other scholars, the sons of the doctor and the Baptist preacher, lads of sixteen, not very mannerly, rather rough country boys, who nudged one another and regarded John with amused interest. In two or three days John knew that he was in the care of an unusually scholarly man, who became at once his friend and treated the lazy village boys and him with considerate kindliness. John liked it. To his surprise, no questions were asked at home about the school, and the afternoons were often free for lonely walks, when Leila went away on her mare and John was at liberty to read or to do as best pleased him. At times Leila bored him, and although with his well-taught courteous ways he was careful not to show impatience, he had the imaginative boy's capacity to enjoy being alone and a long repressed curiosity which now found indulgence among people who liked to answer questions and were pleased when he asked them. Very often, as he came into easier relations with his aunt, he was told to take some query she could not answer to Uncle James or the rector. A rather sensitive lad, he soon became aware that his uncle appeared to take no great interest in him, and, too, the boy's long cultivated though lessening reserve kept them apart. Meanwhile, Ann watched with pleasure his gain in independence, in looks and in appetite. While James Penhallow after his game of whist at night growled in his den over the bitter politics of the day, North and South, his wife read aloud to the children by the fireside in her own small sitting-room or answered as best she could John's questions, confessing ignorance at times or turning to books of reference. It was not always easy to satisfy this restless young mind in a fast developing body. \"Were guinea pigs really pigs? What was the hematite iron-ore his uncle used at the works?\" Once he was surprised. He asked one evening, \"What was the Missouri Compromise?\" He had read so much about it in the papers. \"Hasn't it something to do with slavery? Aunt Ann, it must seem strange to own a man.\" His eager young ears had heard rather ignorant talk of it from his mother's English friends.  His aunt said quietly, \"My people in Maryland own slaves, John. It is not a matter for a child to discuss. The abolitionists at the North are making trouble. It is a subject--we--I do not care to talk about.\"  \"But what is an abolitionist, aunt?\" he urged.  She laughed and said gaily, \"I will answer no more conundrums; ask your uncle.\"  Leila who took no interest in politics fidgeted until she got her chance when Mrs. Ann would not answer John. \"I want to hear about that talking oak, John.\"  She was quicker than he to observe her aunt's annoyance, and Ann, glad to be let off easily, found the needed book, and for a time they fell under the charm of Tennyson, and then earlier than usual were sent to bed.  The days ran on into weeks of school, and now there were snow-shoe tramps or sleigh rides to see some big piece of casting at the forge, where persistently-curious John did learn from some one what hematite was. The life became to him steadily more and more pleasant as he shed with ease the habits of an over regulated life, and living wholesome days prospered in body and mind.  Christmas was a disappointment to Leila and to him. There was an outbreak of measles at Westways and there would be no carols, nor children gathered at Grey Pine. Ann's usual bounty of toys was sent to the village. John's present from his uncle was a pair of skates, and then Leila saw a delightful chance to add another branch of education. Next morning, for this was holiday-week, she asked if he would like to learn to skate. They had gone early to the cabin and were lazily enjoying a rest after a snow-shoe tramp. He replied, in an absent way, \"I suppose I may as well learn. How many Indians were there?\"  \"I don't know. Who cares now?\"  \"I do.\"  \"I never saw such a boy. You can't ride and you can't skate. You are just good for nothing. You're just fit to be sold at a rummage-sale.\"  He was less easily vexed than made curious. \"What's a rummage-sale?\"  \"Oh! we had one two years ago. Once in a while Aunt Ann says there must be one, so she gathers up all the trash and Uncle Jim's old clothes (he hates that), and the village people they buy things. And Mr. Rivers sells the things at auction, you "]]]
