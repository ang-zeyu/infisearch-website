Miss Hibben goes on to say that only a fromage à la crème made in Quebec had come anywhere near her impression of the new Swedish triumph. She quotes the last word from the makers themselves: \"This is a very special product that has never been made on this earth before,\" and speaks of \"the elusive flavor of mushrooms\" before summing up, \"the exquisitely textured curd and the unexpectedly fresh flavor combine to make it one of the most subtly enjoyable foods that have come my way in a long time.\"  And so say we--all of us.  Hand Cheese  Hand cheese has this niche in our Cheese Hall of Fame not because we consider it great, but because it is usually included among the eighteen varieties on which the hundreds of others are based. It is named from having been molded into its final shape by hand. Universally popular with Germanic races, it is too strong for the others. To our mind, Hand cheese never had anything that Allgäuer or Limburger hasn't improved upon.  It is the only cheese that is commonly melted into steins of beer and drunk instead of eaten. It is usually studded with caraway seeds, the most natural spice for curds.   Limburger  Limburger has always been popular in America, ever since it was brought over by German-American immigrants; but England never took to it. This is eloquently expressed in the following entry in the English _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_:       Limburger cheese is chiefly famous for its pungently offensive      odor. It is made from skimmed milk, and allowed to partially      decompose before pressing. It is very little known in this      country, and might be less so with advantage to consumers.  But this is libel. Butter-soft and sapid, Limburger has brought gustatory pleasure to millions of hardy gastronomes since it came to light in the province of Lüttich in Belgium. It has been Americanized for almost a century and is by now one of the very few cheeses successfully imitated here, chiefly in New York and Wisconsin.  Early Wisconsiners will never forget the Limburger Rebellion in Green County, when the people rose in protest against the Limburger caravan that was accustomed to park in the little town of Monroe where it was marketed. They threatened to stage a modern Boston Tea Party and dump the odoriferous bricks in the river, when five or six wagonloads were left ripening in the sun in front of the town bank. The Limburger was finally stored safely underground.   Livarot  Livarot has been described as decadent, \"The very Verlaine of them all,\" and Victor Meusy personifies it in a poem dedicated to all the great French cheeses, of which we give a free translation:      In the dog days     In its overflowing dish     Livarot gesticulates     Or weeps like a child.   Münster      At the diplomatic banquet     One must choose his piece.     All is politics,     A cheese and a flag.      You annoy the Russians     If you take Chester;     You irritate the Prussians     In choosing Münster.   Victor Meusy  Like Limburger, this male cheese, often caraway-flavored, does not fare well in England. Although over here we consider Münster far milder than Limburger, the English writer Eric Weir in _When Madame Cooks_ will have none of it:  I cannot think why this cheese was not thrown from the aeroplanes during the war to spread panic amongst enemy troops. It would have proved far more efficacious than those nasty deadly gases that kill people permanently.   Neufchâtel      If the cream cheese be white     Far fairer the hands that made them.      Arthur Hugh Clough  Although originally from Normandy, Neufchâtel, like Limburger, was so long ago welcomed to America and made so splendidly at home here that we may consider it our very own. All we have against it is that it has served as the model for too many processed abominations.  Parmesan, Romano, Pecorino, Pecorino Romano  Parmesan when young, soft and slightly crumbly is eaten on bread. But when well aged, let us say up to a century, it becomes Rock of Gibraltar of cheeses and really suited for grating. It is easy to believe that the so-called \"Spanish cheese\" used as a barricade by Americans in Nicaragua almost a century ago was none other than the almost indestructible Grana, as Parmesan is called in Italy.  The association between cheese and battling began in B.C. days with the Jews and Romans, who fed cheese to their soldiers not only for its energy value but as a convenient form of rations, since every army travels on its stomach and can't go faster than its impedimenta. The last notable mention of cheese in war was the name of the _Monitor_: \"A cheese box on a raft.\"  Romano is not as expensive as Parmesan, although it is as friable, sharp and tangy for flavoring, especially for soups such as onion and minestrone. It is brittle and just off-white when well aged.  Although made of sheep's milk, Pecorino is classed with both Parmesan and Romano. All three are excellently imitated in Argentina. Romano and Pecorino Romano are interchangeable names for the strong, medium-sharp and piquant Parmesan types that sell for considerably less. Most of it is now shipped from Sardinia. There are several different kinds: Pecorino Dolce (sweet), Sardo Tuscano, and Pecorino Romano Cacio, which relates it to Caciocavallo.  Kibitzers complain that some of the cheaper types of Pecorino are soapy, but fans give it high praise. Gillian F., in her \"Letter from Italy\" in Osbert Burdett's delectable _Little Book of Cheese_, writes:       Out in the orchard, my companion, I don't remember how, had      provided the miracle: a flask of wine, a loaf of bread and a slab      of fresh Pecorino cheese (there wasn't any \"thou\" for either) ...      But that cheese was Paradise; and the flask was emptied, and a      wood dove cooing made you think that the flask's contents were in      a crystal goblet instead of an enamel cup ... one only ... and      the cheese broken with the fingers ... a cheese of cheeses.   Pont L'Evêque  This semisoft, medium-strong, golden-tinted French classic made since the thirteenth century, is definitely a dessert cheese whose excellence is brought out best by a sound claret or tawny port.   Port-Salut (_See_ Trappist)   Provolone  Within recent years Provolone has taken America by storm, as Camembert, Roquefort, Swiss, Limburger, Neufchâtel and such great ones did long before. But it has not been successfully imitated here because the original is made of rich water-buffalo milk unattainable in the Americas.  With Caciocavallo, this mellow, smoky flavorsome delight is put up in all sorts of artistic forms, red-cellophaned apples, pears, bells, a regular zoo of animals, and in all sorts of sizes, up to a monumental hundred-pound bas-relief imported for exhibition purposes by Phil Alpert.   Roquefort  Homage to this _fromage!_ Long hailed as _le roi_ Roquefort, it has filled books and booklets beyond count. By the miracle of _Penicillium Roqueforti_ a new cheese was made. It is placed historically back around the eighth century when Charlemagne was found picking out the green spots of Persillé with the point of his knife, thinking them decay. But the monks of Saint-Gall, who were his hosts, recorded in their annals that when they regaled him with Roquefort (because it was Friday and they had no fish) they also made bold to tell him he was wasting the best part of the cheese. So he tasted again, found the advice excellent and liked it so well he ordered two _caisses_ of it sent every year to his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. He also suggested that it be cut in half first, to make sure it was well veined with blue, and then bound up with a wooden fastening.  Perhaps he hoped the wood would protect the cheeses from mice and rats, for the good monks of Saint-Gall couldn't be expected to send an escort of cats from their chalky caves to guard them--even for Charlemagne. There is no telling how many cats were mustered out in the caves, in those early days, but a recent census put the number at five hundred. We can readily imagine the head handler in the caves leading a night inspection with a candle, followed by his chief taster and a regiment of cats. While the Dutch and other makers of cheese also employ cats to patrol their storage caves, Roquefort holds the record for number. An interesting point in this connection is that as rats and mice pick only the prime cheeses, a gnawed one is not thrown away but greatly prized.   Sapsago, Schabziger or Swiss Green Cheese  The name Sapsago is a corruption of Schabziger, German for whey cheese. It's a hay cheese, flavored heavily with melilot, a kind of clover that's also grown for hay. It comes from Switzerland in a hard, truncated cone wrapped in a piece of paper that says:          To be used grated only         Genuine Swiss Green Cheese         Made of skimmed milk and herbs      To the housewives! Do you want a change in your meals? Try the     contents of this wrapper! Delicious as spreading mixed with butter,     excellent for flavoring eggs, macaroni, spaghetti, potatoes, soup,     etc. Can be used in place of any other cheese. _Do not take too     much, you might spoil the flavor_.  We put this wrapper among our papers, sealed it tight in an envelope, and to this day, six months later, the scent of Sapsago clings 'round it still.   Stilton       _Honor for Cheeses_       Literary and munching circles in London are putting quite a lot      of thought into a proposed memorial to Stilton cheese. There is a      Stilton Memorial Committee, with Sir John Squire at the head, and      already the boys are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],["title","The Complete Book of Cheese (#4)"],["body","g.       One side, led by Sir John, is all for a monument.       This, presumably, would not be a replica of Stilton itself,      although Mr. Epstein could probably hack out a pretty effective      cheese-shaped figure and call it \"Dolorosa.\"       The monument-boosters plan a figure of Mrs. Paulet, who first      introduced Stilton to England. (Possibly a group showing Mrs.      Paulet holding a young Stilton by the hand and introducing it,      while the Stilton curtsies.)       T.S. Eliot does not think that anyone would look at a monument,      but wants to establish a Foundation for the Preservation of      Ancient Cheeses. The practicability of this plan would depend      largely on the site selected for the treasure house and the cost      of obtaining a curator who could, or would, give his whole time      to the work.       Mr. J.A. Symonds, who is secretary of the committee, agrees with      Mr. Eliot that a simple statue is not the best form.       \"I should like,\" he says, \"something irrelevant--gargoyles,      perhaps.\"       I think that Mr. Symonds has hit on something there.       I would suggest, if we Americans can pitch into this great      movement, some gargoyles designed by Mr. Rube Goldberg.       If the memorial could be devised so as to take on an      international scope, an exchange fellowship might be established      between England and America, although the exchange, in the case      of Stilton, would have to be all on England's side.       We might be allowed to furnish the money, however, while England      furnishes the cheese.       There is a very good precedent for such a bargain between the two      countries.       Robert Benchley, in _After 1903--What?_  When all seems lost in England there is still Stilton, an endless after-dinner conversation piece to which England points with pride. For a sound appreciation of this cheese see Clifton Fadiman's introduction to this book.   Taleggio and Bel Paese  When the great Italian cheese-maker, Galbini, first exported Bel Paese some years ago, it was an eloquent ambassador to America. But as the years went on and imitations were made in many lands, Galbini deemed it wise to set up his own factory in _our_ beautiful country. However, the domestic Bel Paese and a minute one-pounder called Bel Paesino just didn't have that old Alpine zest. They were no better than the German copy called Schönland, after the original, or the French Fleur des Alpes.  Mel Fino was a blend of Bel Paese and Gorgonzola. It perked up the market for a full, fruity cheese with snap. Then Galbini hit the jackpot with his Taleggio that fills the need for the sharpest, most sophisticated pungence of them all.   Trappist, Port-Salut, or Port du Salut, and Oka  In spite of its name Trappist is no rat-trap commoner. Always of the elect, and better known as Port-Salut or Port du Salut from the original home of the Trappist monks in their chief French abbey, it is also set apart from the ordinary Canadians under the name of Oka, from the Trappist monastery there. It is made by Trappist monks all over the world, according to the original secret formula, and by Trappist Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani Trappist in Kentucky.  This is a soft cheese, creamy and of superb flavor. You can't go wrong if you look for the monastery name stamped on, such as Harzé in Belgium, Mont-des-Cats in Flanders, Sainte Anne d'Auray in Brittany, and so forth.  Last but not least, a commercial Port-Salut entirely without benefit of clergy or monastery is made in Milwaukee under the Lion Brand. It is one of the finest American cheeses in which we have ever sunk a fang.     [Illustration]  _Chapter Four_  Native Americans   American Cheddars  The first American Cheddar was made soon after 1620 around Plymouth by Pilgrim fathers who brought along not only cheese from the homeland but a live cow to continue the supply. Proof of our ability to manufacture Cheddar of our own lies in the fact that by 1790 we were exporting it back to England.  It was called Cheddar after the English original named for the village of Cheddar near Bristol. More than a century ago it made a new name for itself, Herkimer County cheese, from the section of New York State where it was first made best. Herkimer still equals its several distinguished competitors, Coon, Colorado Blackie, California Jack, Pineapple, Sage, Vermont Colby and Wisconsin Longhorn.  The English called our imitation Yankee, or American, Cheddar, while here at home it was popularly known as yellow or store cheese from its prominent position in every country store; also apple-pie cheese because of its affinity for the all-American dessert.  The first Cheddar factory was founded by Jesse Williams in Rome, New York, just over a century ago and, with Herkimer County Cheddar already widely known, this established \"New York\" as the preferred \"store-boughten\" cheese.  An account of New York's cheese business in the pioneer Wooden Nutmeg Era is found in Ernest Elmo Calkins' interesting book, _They Broke the Prairies_. A Yankee named Silvanus Ferris, \"the most successful dairyman of Herkimer County,\" in the first decades of the 1800's teamed up with Robert Nesbit, \"the old Quaker Cheese Buyer.\" They bought from farmers in the region and sold in New York City. And \"according to the business ethics of the times,\" Nesbit went ahead to cheapen the cheese offered by deprecating its quality, hinting at a bad market and departing without buying. Later when Ferris arrived in a more optimistic mood, offering a slightly better price, the seller, unaware they were partners, and ignorant of the market price, snapped up the offer.  Similar sharp-trade tactics put too much green cheese on the market, so those honestly aged from a minimum of eight months up to two years fetched higher prices. They were called \"old,\" such as Old Herkimer, Old Wisconsin Longhorn, and Old California Jack.  Although the established Cheddar ages are three, fresh, medium-cured, and cured or aged, commercially they are divided into two and described as mild and sharp. The most popular are named for their states: Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin. Two New York Staters are called and named separately, Coon and Herkimer County. Tillamook goes by its own name with no mention of Oregon. Pineapple, Monterey Jack and Sage are seldom listed as Cheddars at all, although they are basically that.   Brick  Brick is the one and only cheese for which the whole world gives America credit. Runners-up are Liederkranz, which rivals say is too close to Limburger, and Pineapple, which is only a Cheddar under its crisscrossed, painted and flavored rind. Yet Brick is no more distinguished than either of the hundred percent Americans, and in our opinion is less worth bragging about.  It is a medium-firm, mild-to-strong slicing cheese for sandwiches and melting in hot dishes. Its texture is elastic but not rubbery, its taste sweetish, and it is full of little round holes or eyes. All this has inspired enthusiasts to liken it to Emmentaler. The most appropriate name for it has long been \"married man's Limburger.\" To make up for the mildness caraway seed is sometimes added.  About Civil War time, John Jossi, a dairyman of Dodge County, Wisconsin, came up with this novelty, a rennet cheese made of whole cow's milk. The curd is cut like Cheddar, heated, stirred and cooked firm to put in a brick-shaped box without a bottom and with slits in the sides to drain. When this is set on the draining table a couple of bricks are also laid on the cooked curd for pressure. It is this double use of bricks, for shaping and for pressing, that has led to the confusion about which came first in originating the name.  The formed \"bricks\" of cheese are rubbed with salt for three days and they ripen slowly, taking up to two months.  We eat several million pounds a year and 95 percent of that comes from Wisconsin, with a trickle from New York.  Colorado Blackie Cheese  A subtly different American Cheddar is putting Colorado on our cheese map. It is called Blackie from the black-waxed rind and it resembles Vermont State cheese, although it is flatter. This is a proud new American product, proving that although Papa Cheddar was born in England his American kinfolk have developed independent and valuable characters all on their own.   Coon Cheese  Coon cheese is full of flavor from being aged on shelves at a higher temperature than cold storage. Its rind is darker from the growth of mold and this shade is sometimes painted on more ordinary Cheddars to make them look like Coon, which always brings a 10 percent premium above the general run.  Made at Lowville, New York, it has received high praise from a host of admirers, among them the French cook, Clementine, in Phineas Beck's _Kitchen_, who raised it to the par of French immortals by calling it Fromage de Coon. Clementine used it \"with scintillating success in countless French recipes which ended with the words _gratiner au four et servir tres chaud_. She made _baguettes_ of it by soaking sticks three-eights-inch square and one and a half inches long in lukewarm milk, rolling them in flour, beaten egg and bread crumbs and browning them instantaneously in boiling oil.\"   Herkimer County Cheese  The standard method for making American Cheddar was established in Herkimer County, New York, in 1841 and has been rigidly maintained down to this day. Made with rennet and a bacterial \"starter,\" the curd is cut and pressed to squeeze out all of the whey and then aged in cylindrical forms for a year or more.  Herkimer leads the whole breed by being flaky, brittle, sharp and nutty, with a crumb that will crumble, and a soft, mouth-watering pale orange color when it is properly aged.   Isigny  Isigny is a native American cheese that came a cropper. It seems to be extinct now, and perhaps that is all to the good, for it never meant to be anything more than"]]]
