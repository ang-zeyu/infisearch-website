And now the slope of the bank seemed to have been made afresh, as on the day when Sigurd had been closed in, years ago. None could say, save those who had seen it, where the opening into the grave-chamber might be.  Now both the opening and closing of Sigurd's grave mound seem very strange to me. Thord and the scalds will have it that he himself wrought both. As for me, I know not. In after days I told this to Alfred the king when he wondered at my sword, and he said that he thought an earthquake opened and washing rain closed the mound, but that it happened strangely for me. I cannot gainsay his wise words, and I will leave the matter so.  Thereafter Kolgrim and I went back to Einar, who yet waited for us. Glad was he to see us return in safety; but both he and Thord were speechless when they saw the jarl's sword girt to me and the jarl's golden ring on my hand. Neither they nor any one else will believe that I met with no peril; and the tale that the scalds made hereafter of the matter is over wonderful, in spite of all I may say. For they think it but right that I should not be over boastful of my deeds.  But Jarl Einar looked on sword and ring, and said:  \"Well have you won these gifts. My brother is in peace in his resting place now. I hold that he called for you.\"  So we went back to the ships, and there for many days the men stared at Kolgrim and me strangely. They say I was very silent for long, and it is likely enough. Moreover, Einar was wont to say that I seemed five years older from that day forward.  We went no more to the place of the mound, for it seemed to need no care of earthly hands. Nor were any wishing to go to so awesome a place, and we left the firth next day, for the men waxed uneasy there.  But on that day Einar gave me the great ship that we had taken from Halfdan, the king's son, saying that he would add to Sigurd's giving. Also he bade me choose what men I would for her crew, bidding me thank him not at all, for I was his foster son, and a king by birth moreover.  So when I knew that this would please him, I chose Thord for my shipmaster, and Kolgrim for marshal, as we call the one who has charge of the ordering of the crew. And I chose a hundred good men whom I knew well, so that indeed I had the best ship and following in Norway, as I thought. At least there were none better, unless Harald Fairhair might match me.  Now there was one thing that pleased me not at this time, and that was that Kolgrim, my comrade, never called me aught but \"master\" since I came from Sigurd's presence--which is not the wont of our free Norsemen with any man. Nor would he change it, though I was angry, until I grew used to it in time.  \"Call me not 'master,' Kolgrim, my comrade,\" I said; \"it is unfittinq for you.\"  At last he answered me in such wise that I knew it was of no more use to speak of it.  \"Master of mine you are, Ranald the king, since the day when you dared more than I thought man might, while I lay like a beaten hound outside, and dared not go within that place to see what had become of you. Little comradeship was mine to you on that day, and I am minded to make amends if I can. I think I may dare aught against living men for you, though I failed at that mound. I will give life for you, if I may.\"  I told him that what he had done was well done, and indeed he had had courage to go where none else had dared; for I had ties of friendship that made me bold to meet Jarl Sigurd, and might go therefore where he might not. It was well that he did not come into the presence of the dead.  \"Therefore we are comrades, not master and man,\" I said.  \"Nay, but master and man--lord and thrall,\" he answered.  So I must let him have his way, but he could not make me think of him as aught but a good and brave comrade whom I loved well.  They hailed me as king when I went on board my ship for the first time with my own men, as I have said. Then our best weapon smith asked for gold from the men, and they gave what they had--it was in plenty with us of Einar's following--and made a golden circlet round my helm, that they might see it and follow it in battle.  It was good to wear the crown thus given willingly, but in the end it sent me from north to south, as will be seen. That, however, is a matter with which I will not quarrel, for it sent me to Alfred the king.  We had left the firth two days, cruising slowly northward, when one ship came from the north and met us, not flying from our fleet, but bearing up to join us. And when she was close, there came a hail to tell Einar that she bore a messenger from Harald the king in peace, and presently we hove to while this messenger went on board the Jarl's ship.  Then it seemed that Einar had been right, and that Harald would lay a fine on the islands for Halfdan's slaying, and so give them back to Einar to hold for him. The messenger was Thiodolf, Harald's own scald, and he put the matter very plainly before the jarl, so that he thought well of the offer, but would nevertheless not trust himself in the king's power before all was certain, and confirmed by oath. Whereon Thiodolf said that one must see the king on the Jarl's part, and so I seemed the right man to go, as the jarl's foster son and next in command to him.  \"Nevertheless,\" said Thiodolf, \"I would not advise you to sail in Halfdan's ship, for that might wake angry thoughts, and trouble would come especially as Halfdan took her without leave when he was outlawed.\"  So I took the Jarl's cutter, manning her with enough men of my own crew; and Kolgrim came with me, and we sailed to Kirkwall in company with Thiodolf the scald.  Then when Thiodolf took me into his presence, I saw Harald Fairhair for the first time, as he sat to receive Einar's messenger in the great hall that Sigurd had built and which we had dwelt in. Then I thought that never before could have been one more like a king. Hereafter, when sagamen will sing of a king in some fancied story, they will surely make him like King Harald of Norway. I myself have little skill to say what he was like beyond this--that never had I seen a more handsome man, nor bigger, nor stronger. King-like he was in all ways, and his face was bright and pleasant, though it was plain that it would be terrible if he was angry, or with the light of battle upon it.  The hair, whence he had his name, was golden bright and shining, and beard and eyebrows were of the same colour. But his eyes were neither grey nor blue altogether, most piercing, seeming to look straight into a man's heart, so that none dared lie to him.  I think that it is saying much for King Harald that, though his arms and dress were wonderfully rich and splendid, one cared only to look on his face; and that though many men of worth were on the high place with him, there seemed to be none but he present.  When the scald told the king who I was, and what was my errand, with all ceremony, he looked fixedly at me, so that I was ashamed, and grew red under his gaze. Then he smiled pleasantly, and spoke to me. His voice was as I thought to hear it--clear and steady, and yet deep.  \"So, Ranald Vemundsson, you are worthy of your father. It may be that you bear me ill will on his account, but I would have you forget the deeds done that Norway might be one, and the happier therefor.\"  \"Had my father been slain in fair fight, lord king,\" I said, \"no ill will had been thought of. It has not been in my mind that you bade Rognvald slay him as he did. And that Jarl is dead, and the feud is done with therefore. Jarl Einar is my foster father, moreover.\"  \"That is well said,\" answered Harald. \"But I thought Sigurd must have fostered you; he was ever a close friend of Vemund's.\"  I did not know why the king thought this, though the reason was at my side; so I only said that my mother had given me to Einar's keeping, and the king said no more at that time about it.  After that I gave the Jarl's messages, and the king heard them well enough, though it seemed to Einar that the weregild to be paid was over heavy, and he had bidden me tell Harald that it was so. Therefore the king said that he would give me an answer on the morrow, and I went away into the town well pleased with his kindly way with me.  There was a feast made for me that night, and after it I must sit still and hear the scalds sing of the deeds of Harald the king, which was well enough. But then Thiodolf rose up and sang a great saga about the winning of Sigurd's sword, wherein it seemed that I had fought the dead jarl, and bale fires, and I know not what. He had heard strange tales from Einar's men, if they told him all that he sang.  Some men may be pleased to hear their own deeds sung of, with more added thus; but I was not used to it, and the turning of all eyes to me made me uncomfortable. But Harald had paid no sort of heed to what they sang of him, and so I tried to look at my ease, and gave the scald a bracelet when he ended.  \"Overmuch make you of that matter, scald,\" said I quietly.  He laughed a little, and answered:  \"One has to fill in what a warrior will not tell of himself.\"  Now the men shouted when I gave Thiodolf the bracelet, and Harald looked quickly at me. Then I thought that maybe I had overdone the gift, though Einar had ever told me that a good scald deserved good reward, and Thiodolf was well known as the best in Norway. It was a heavy ring, silver gilt, and of good design, that I took from the same viking whose sword I gave to Sigurd.  \"Overpaid am I,\" the scald said, putting it on his arm.  \"You are the first who has ever sung of me,\" I answered; \"and the voice and tune were wonderful, if the saga was too strong for me.\"  Then Harald smiled again, and praised Thiodolf also, and I thought no more of the matter. The feast was pleasant enough in the hall, full of Harald's best men and chiefs, though it seemed strange to sit as a guest in Einar'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14034"],["title","King Alfred's Viking: A Story of the First English Fleet (#5)"],["body","house.  Now on the next morning I was to speak with the king about Einar's business, and I went to him unarmed, as was right, save for helm and Sigurd's sword. He was in the jarl's own chamber, and with him were Thiodolf and a young scald named Harek, who sat with things for writing before him, which was what I had never seen before.  We talked for some time, and all went well for peace; but one more message was to go and come between the king and Einar, and so I said I would sail at once.  \"Not so much need for haste but that you can bide here for a day or two,\" Harald said. \"I will not have you complain of my hospitality hereafter. And Thiodolf and Harek here want to learn more about Sigurd's sword and its winning.\"  \"If I tell them the truth, I shall spoil their saga, lord king!\" I said, laughing.  \"Trust the scalds to mind you do not,\" he answered. \"There are times when I have to ask them which of my own doings they are singing about now. But is there no wonder in the tale?\"  So I told him just how the matter was. And when he heard of the noise, and the stroke with which the ships were smitten, he said, looking troubled, as I thought:  \"Sigurd is stronger now that he is dead than when he lived. We felt that stroke even here.\"  But when I told how I had seen the dead jarl, his face grew thoughtful, and at last he said:  \"So shall I lie some day in a grave mound. It is passing strange to think on. I would that if one comes to my side he may step gently as you, Ranald Vemundsson.\"  \"Else will that comer fare ill,\" said Thiodolf.  The king glanced up at him, and his face changed, and he said, smiling grimly:  \"Maybe. I think none will win my sword from me.\"  Then he had Kolgrim sent for, and Thord, and they told him truly what they had seen, and how they had fared in the matter.  \"You are a truth teller, Kolgrim the Tall,\" Harald said. \"Now if you will leave Einar's service and come and be of my courtmen, I will speak to the jarl and make matters right with him, and it shall be worth your while.\"  Then my comrade answered plainly:  \"I am no jarl's man now, King Harald; I belong to King Ranald here, and I will not leave him.\"  \"So,\" said Harald, knitting his brows suddenly, \"we have two kings in the room, as it seems; and you dare choose another instead of me.\"  \"Not so, King Harald,\" Kolgrim answered, with all respect; \"I chose between the jarl and my king. If there is peace between you and the jarl, I suppose we are all your men.\"  Now Harald's face was growing black, and I could see that his anger was rising. But he stayed what words he was about to speak, and only said:  \"Jarl Einar is well served when he has a king in his train.\"  Then he rose up and turned to Thiodolf, who was looking anxious.  \"Bid King Ranald to the feast tonight. He knows my words to Einar his foster father, and I have no more to say.\"  So I was dismissed, and was not sorry to be outside the hall.  \"Let us get down to the ship,\" said Thord. \"Here is trouble brewing, as I think.\"  So we went on board, and I wished that we might go. Yet the king had bidden me stay, and I had no reason for what would be discourteous at least, if it did not look like flight. What the trouble was we could hardly understand.  In an hour's time or so I saw Thiodolf and the young scald Harek coming along the wharf and towards our ship, which lay clear of Harald's vessels, and next the harbour mouth. They came over the gang plank, and I welcomed them, but I saw that they had somewhat special to say to me.  They sat down under the after awning with me, and at once Thiodolf said:  \"That was an unlucky speech of your comrade's just now. No man dares name himself king in Harald's presence--not even his own sons. It is the one thing that he will not bear.\"  \"So it seemed,\" said I; \"and, in truth, he had enough trouble with under kings not long since. But he knows what a sea king is--no king at all, so to speak. He need not grudge the old title.\"  \"That is not all,\" Thiodolf said. \"It is in his mind that he has to guard yet against risings of men of the old families of the kings, and thinks you are likely to give him trouble. Maybe the portent of the blow that spread from Sigurd's tomb to us has seemed much to him. 'Here,' he says, 'is one who will gather masterless men to him in crowds because he wears Sigurd's sword and ring, and has gained with them the name of a hero. Already he has two of Einar's best men at his heels. Yet I like him well enough, and I have no fault to find with him, save that he puts a gold circle round his helm and is called king--as he would have been but for me. Go to him, therefore, and tell him to keep out of my way. I will not have two kings in Norway.'\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"that is plain speaking. But I cannot help what the men call me. The king makes overmuch of the business. I am not foolish enough to try to overturn Harald Fairhair.\"  \"Maybe,\" said Thiodolf, \"but those are his words. I rede you get away quickly on the next tide.\"  \"Ay,\" said Harek. \"Harald is mild of mood now, because you made no secret of what men call you. Five years ago you would not have escaped hence at all.\"  \"Then,\" said I, \"I will go. I think you are right. Vemund's son troubles Harald;\" and I laughed, and added, \"I have to thank you for kindly counsel, scalds, as I think. Farewell. Tide serves at any time now, and I will get my men and be gone.\"  \"That is wise,\" they answered. \"Einar must find some other messenger, if he comes not himself, after you return.\"  They went, and I called two or three men and sent them into the town for their comrades who were at friends' houses and in the guest house where we were lodged, while Kolgrim made ready for instant sailing.  The next thing that I was ware of was that there was a fight on the wharf end next the town, and men were running to it. Then I heard my own name shouted on one part, and that of Eric, the king's young son, on the other. So I was going to lead down twenty men to quiet the scuffle, when my people had the best of the matter, and broke through the throng, cheering, and came on to me. The rest did not follow them, for they saw that I was coming, and the wharf was clear behind them but for three of their foes who stayed where they had fallen.  Then another man broke away from the crowd, and came running after my folk. It was Harek the scald, with his head broken.  \"Here are fine doings,\" said Kolgrim, as the men swarmed on board. \"What is on hand now?\"  \"It is not done with yet,\" said a man: \"look at yon ship.\"  Then came Harek, out of breath, and pale.  \"Let me on board, King Ranald, or I am a dead man,\" he cried.  \"Come, then!\" I answered; and he ran across the plank, and Kolgrim pulled it in after him. All my men were come.  Then I looked at the ship spoken of. Men were swarming into her, and were making ready to sail. But if she meant to stay our going, she was too far up the harbour, and we were already casting off the shore ropes.  \"Hold on,\" said Thord; \"here come the other scald and two men.\"  The crowd that was yet round the fallen men had parted to let Thiodolf pass, and he came quickly. One of the men bore a chest, and the other a bale of somewhat. They gave these over the gunwale to my people, and Thiodolf spoke to me from the wharf.  \"These are gifts from Harald to Einar's foster son,\" he said. \"He bids me say that you have done your errand well, and that this is to prove it. Also he says that Ranald, son of Vemund, may need mail to keep his kingship withal, and so he has sent you a suit.\"  \"That is a hard saying,\" I answered; \"is it insult?\"  \"Nay, but a broad hint only. The gift is most goodly.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"it is plain that he will warn me from Norway. I will leave you, good friend, to say for me what should be said. Maybe if I sent a message it would go wrongly from my lips.\"  Thiodolf laughed, and bade me farewell. He paid no heed to Harek, who sat on the deck with his back to him.  Then Kolgrim whistled shrill to his men, and we began to move down to the harbour mouth. I heard a sharp voice hurrying the men in the other ship; but they could not be ready in time to catch us.  When we were well out to sea, I asked Harek what all this was about.  \"Your going has spoiled a plan that Eric, the king's son, had made. He wanted your sword, and thought also that to rid himself now of Vemund's son might save him trouble when the crown came to him, as it will. You were to be set on as you came from the feast tonight to the guest quarters, as if in a common broil between your men and his. Then he found you were going, and tried to stay your men, and next to take these gifts from Thiodolf and me, being very angry, even to trying to cut me down. Lucky for me that his sword turned in his hand. But he would have had me slain tonight, certainly, for he says that it was our fault that you are getting away. He fears Thiodolf, however. Now I must take service with you, if you will have me.\"  It seemed to me that I was making friends with one hand and enemies with the other, and that last rather more quickly than was well. So I laughed, and answered:  \"I suppose that if I have a scald of my own, King Harald will blame me for overmuch kingship. However, he is angry enough already, and maybe a good friend will balance that to me. So if you will indeed cast in your lot with me, I am glad!\"  So I took his hand, and more than friends have he and I been from that day forward.  Now, when I looked at Harald's strangely-given gifts, I had reason to say that he was open handed. The chest held two mail shirts, one of steel rings, gold ornamented and fastened, and the other of scales on deerskin, both fit for a king. There were two helms also, one to match either byrnie {iv}, and a seax that was fit to hang with Sigurd's sword. As for the bale, that held furs of the best, and blue cloth and scarlet. If Harald banished me, it was for no ill will; and it was handsomely done, as though he would fit me out for the"]]]
