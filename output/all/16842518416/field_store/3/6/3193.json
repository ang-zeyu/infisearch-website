His requests for such a trial reading of his scores were seldom refused, and the practical training in instrumentation which was afforded by the experience he always regarded as invaluable. Much that he tested in this manner was condemned as a result of the illuminating, if chastening, revelations thus brought about; and almost all of his orchestral writing which he afterward thought fit to publish received the benefit of such practical tests.  The music which dates from this period comprises the three songs of opus 11 (\"Mein Liebchen,\"[2] \"Du liebst mich nicht,\" \"Oben, wo die Sterne glühen\"); the two songs of op. 12 (\"Nachtlied\" and \"Das Rosenband\"); the Prelude and Fugue (op. 13); the second piano suite (op. 14)--begun in the days of his Darmstadt professorship; the \"Serenade\" (op. 16); the two \"Fantasiestücke\" of op. 17: \"Erzählung\" and the much-played \"Hexentanz\"; the \"Barcarolle\" and \"Humoreske\" of op. 18; and the \"Wald-Idyllen\" (op. 19): \"Waldesstille,\" \"Spiel der Nymphen,\" \"Träumerei,\" \"Dryadentanz.\"  [2] I give the German titles under which these compositions were originally published.  In June, 1884, MacDowell returned to America, and on July 21, at Waterford, Connecticut, he was married to his former pupil, Miss Marian Nevins--a union, which, for perfection of sympathy and closeness of comradeship, was, during the quarter of a century for which it was to endure, nothing less than ideal. A few days later MacDowell and his bride sailed from New York for Europe, innocent of any very definite plans for the immediate future. They visited Exeter and Bath, and then went to London, where they found lodgings at No. 5, Woburn Place. There MacDowell's interest in the outer world was divided between the British Museum, where he found a particular fascination in the Egyptian and Syrian antiquities, and the Shakespearian performances of Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. He was captivated by their performance of \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" and made a sketch for a symphonic poem which was to be called \"Beatrice and Benedick\"--a plan which he finally abandoned. Most of the material which was to form the symphonic poem went ultimately to the making of the scherzo of the second piano concerto, composed during the following year.  Returning to Frankfort, MacDowell and his wife lived for a short time in a pension in the Praunheimer Strasse, keeping very much to themselves in two small rooms. Upon their return from a brief excursion to Paris, they found less restricted quarters in the Hotel du Nord. In September of this year MacDowell learned of an advantageous position that had been vacated at the Würzburg Conservatory, and, assisted by letters from Frau Raff, Marmontel (his former instructor at the Paris Conservatory), and the violinist Sauret, he sought the place. But again, as at Frankfort three years before, his youth was in his disfavour, and he was courteously rejected.  [Illustration: A LETTER FROM LISZT TO MACDOWELL ACCEPTING THE DEDICATION OF THE FIRST PIANO CONCERTO (SEE PAGE 19)]  The following winter was given over largely to composition. The two-part symphonic poem, \"Hamlet and Ophelia,\" his first production of important significance, was composed at this time. The \"Drei Poesien\" (op. 20) and \"Mondbilder\" (op. 21), both written for four-hand performance, also date from the winter of 1884-85, and the second piano concerto was begun. The \"Moon Pictures\" of op. 21 (\"The Hindoo Maiden,\" \"Stork's Story,\" \"In Tyrol,\" \"The Swan,\" \"Visit of the Bear\"), after Hans Christian Andersen, were at first intended to form a miniature orchestral suite; but an opportunity arose to have them printed as piano duets, and the orchestral sketches were destroyed--a regrettable outcome, as it seems.  His pupils, he found, were scattered, and he gave himself up without restraint to the pleasures of creative writing. These were days of quiet and deep happiness. He read much, often aloud in the evening--fairy-tales, of which he was devotedly fond, legendary lore of different countries, mediaeval romances, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson, Benvenuto Cellini's Memoirs, Victor Hugo, Heine; and also Mark Twain. Later, in the spring, the days were devoted partly to composition and partly to long walks with his wife in the beautiful Frankfort woods, where was suggested to MacDowell the particular mood that found embodiment, many years later, in one of the last things that he wrote: \"From a German Forest,\" in the collection of \"Fireside Tales.\"  The following summer (1885), the death of a friend of his earlier Frankfort days, Lindsay Deas, a Scotchman, left vacant in Edinburgh the post of examiner for the Royal Academy of Music, and Deas's family presented MacDowell's name as a candidate. A trip to London was undertaken for the purpose of securing the place, if possible--since composition alone could not be depended upon for a livelihood; but again his youth, as well as his nationality and his \"modern tendencies,\" militated against him. He was obliged to admit that he had been a protégé of \"that dreadful man Liszt,\" as the potentate of Weimar was characterised by Lady Macfarren, an all-powerful factor in the control of the institution; and that proving finally his abandonment to a nefarious modernity, he was again rejected.  Upon their return to Germany the MacDowells moved from Frankfort to Wiesbaden, where they spent the winter of 1885-86, living in a small pension. The first concerto (op. 15) had recently been published by Breitkopf and Härtel. The same year (1885) was marked by the completion of the second concerto in D-minor, begun at Frankfort in the previous winter, and the publication by Breitkopf and Härtel of the full score of \"Hamlet and Ophelia,\"[3] with a dedication to Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, from whose performances in London MacDowell had caught the suggestion for the music. In the summer of 1886 MacDowell and his wife again yielded to their passion for travelling and went to London to buy furniture, for they had wearied of living in pensions and hotels and had determined to set up housekeeping. When they returned they hired a little flat in the Jahnstrasse and installed themselves therewith just enough furniture to give them countenance. Here Mrs. MacDowell suffered an illness which threatened for a time to bring a tragic termination to their happiness, and through which the hope of a child was lost to them.  [3] The published score of this opus bears the title (in German): \"Hamlet; Ophelia: Two Poems for Grand Orchestra.\" But MacDowell afterward changed his mind concerning this designation, and preferred to entitle the work: \"First Symphonic Poem (a. 'Hamlet'; b. 'Ophelia').\" This alteration is written in MacDowell's handwriting in his copy of the printed score. When \"Lancelot and Elaine\" was published three years later it bore the sub-title: \"Second Symphonic Poem.\"  One afternoon in the spring of 1887 MacDowell and his friend Templeton Strong, a brilliant American composer who had recently moved from his home in Leipzig to Wiesbaden, were tramping through the country when they came upon a dilapidated cottage on the edge of the woods, in the Grubweg. It had been built by a rich German, not as a habitation, but as a kind of elaborate summer house. The situation was enticing. The little building stood on the side of the Neroberg, overlooking the town on one side, with the Rhine and the Main beyond, and on the other side the woods. The two Americans were captivated by it, and nothing would do but that MacDowell should purchase it for a home. There was some question of its practicability by his cooler-headed wife; but eventually the cottage was bought, with half an acre of ground, and the MacDowells ensconced themselves. There was a small garden, in which MacDowell delighted to dig; the woods were within a stone's throw; and he and Strong, who were inseparable friends, walked together and disputed amicably concerning principles and methods of music-making, and the need for patriotism, in which Strong was conceived to be deficient.  This was a time of rich productiveness for MacDowell; and the life that he and his wife were able to live was of an ideal serenity and detachment. He was now devoting his entire energy to composition. He put forth during these years at Wiesbaden the four pieces of op. 24 (\"Humoresque,\" \"March,\" \"Cradle Song,\" \"Czardas\"); the symphonic poem \"Lancelot and Elaine\" (op. 25); the six songs, \"From An Old Garden,\" to words by Margaret Deland (op. 26); the three songs for male chorus of op. 27 (\"In the Starry Sky Above Us,\" \"Springtime,\" \"The Fisherboy\"); the \"Idyls\" and \"Poems\" for piano (op. 28 and op. 31), after Goethe and Heine; the symphonic poem \"Lamia\" (op. 29); the two \"Fragments\" for orchestra after the \"Song of Roland\": \"The Saracens\" and \"The Lovely Aldâ\" (op. 30); the \"Four Little Poems\" for piano--\"The Eagle,\" \"The Brook,\" \"Moonshine,\" \"Winter\" (op. 32); the three songs of op. 33 (\"Prayer,\" \"Cradle Hymn,\" \"Idyl\") and the two of op. 34 (\"Menie,\" \"My Jean\"); and the \"Romance\" for 'cello and orchestra. He had, moreover, the satisfaction of knowing that his work was being received, both in Europe and in his own country, with interest and respect. His reputation had begun unmistakably to spread. \"Hamlet and Ophelia\" had been performed at Darmstadt, Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, Sondershausen, Frankfort. On March 8, 1884, his former teacher, Teresa Carreno, had played his second piano suite at a recital in New York; in March of the following year two movements from the first suite were played at an \"American Concert\" given at Princes' Hall, London; on March 30, 1885, at one of Mr. Frank Van der Stucken's \"Novelty Concerts\" in New York, Miss Adele Margulies played the second and third movements from the first piano concerto. In the same year Mme. Carreño played on tour in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14109"],["title","Edward MacDowell: A Study (#4)"],["body","three movements from the second suite, and in the following September she played at the Worcester Festival of that year the \"Hexentanz\" of op. 17. On November 4, 1886, the \"Ophelia\" section of op. 22 was performed at the first of Mr. Van der Stucken's \"Symphonic Concerts\" at Chickering Hall, New York. Mr. H.E. Krehbiel, reviewing the work in the _Tribune_, praised the orchestration as \"brilliant\" (\"though the models studied are rather more obvious than we like\"), the melodic invention as \"beautiful\" and as having a poetical mood and characteristic outline. He considered that the music deserved repetition during the course of the season, and pronounced it \"a finer work in every respect than the majority of the novelties which have come to us this season with French and English labels.\" Mr. Henry T. Finck, writing in the _Evening Post_, characterised the work as \"an exquisitely conceived tone-poem, charmingly orchestrated and full of striking harmonic progressions.\" A year after the performance of the \"Ophelia\" in New York Mr. Van der Stucken produced its companion piece, \"Hamlet.\" In April, 1888, at the first of a course of \"pianoforte-concerto concerts\" given by Mr. B.J. Lang at Chickering Hall, Boston, MacDowell's first concerto was played by Mr. B.L. Whelpley. \"The effect upon all present,\" wrote Mr. W.F. Apthorp in the _Transcript_, \"was simply electric.\" The concerto \"was a surprise, if ever there was one. We can hardly,\" he declared, \"recall a composition so full of astonishing and unprecedented effects [it will be recalled that this concerto was composed in 1882, when MacDowell was nineteen years old]. The work was evidently written at white heat; its brilliancy and vigour are astounding. The impression it made upon us, in other respects, is as yet rather undigested... But its fire and forcibleness are unmistakable.\" These opinions are of interest, for they testify to the prompt and ungrudging recognition which was accorded to MacDowell's work, from the first, by responsible critics in his own country.  He might well have felt some pride in the sum of his achievements at this time. He had not completed his twenty-seventh year; yet he had published a concerto and two orchestral works of important dimensions--\"Hamlet and Ophelia\" and \"Lancelot and Elaine\"; most of the music that he had so far written had been publicly performed, and almost invariably praised with warmth; and he was becoming known in Europe and at home. His material affairs, however, were far from being in a satisfactory or promising condition; for there was little more than a precarious income to be counted upon from his compositions; and he had given up teaching. Musicians from America began coming to the little Wiesbaden retreat to visit the composer and his wife, and he was repeatedly urged to return to America and assume his share in the development of the musical art of his country. It was finally decided that, all things considered, conditions would be more favorable in the United States; and in September, 1888, the MacDowells sold their Wiesbaden cottage, not without many pangs, and sailed for their own shores.  [Illustration: MACDOWELL AND TEMPLETON STRONG From a photograph taken at Wiesbaden in 1888]  They settled in Boston, as being less huge and tumultuous than New York, and took lodgings in Mount Vernon Street. In later years they lived successively at 13 West Cedar Street and at 38 Chestnut Street. Though all of his more important music was as yet unwritten, MacDowell found himself already established in the view of the musical public as a composer abundantly worthy of honour at the hands of his countrymen. He made his first public appearance in America, in the double capacity of pianist and composer, at a Kneisel Quartet concert in Chickering Hall, Boston, on November 19, 1888, playing the Prelude, Intermezzo, and Presto from his first piano suite, and, with Kneisel and his associates, the piano part in Goldmark's B-flat Quintet. He was cordially received, and Mr. Apthorp, writing in the _Transcript_ of his piano playing, praised his technique as \"ample and brilliant,\" and as being especially admirable \"in the higher phases of playing\"; \"he plays,\" wrote this critic, \"with admirable truth of sentiment and musical understanding.\" Of the early and immature suite he could not well write with much enthusiasm, though he found in it \"life and brightness.\"  In the following spring MacDowell made a more auspicious appearance, and one which more justly disclosed his abilities as a composer, when, on March 5, he played his second concerto, for the first time in public, at an orchestral concert in Chickering Hall, New York, under the direction of Mr. Theodore Thomas. His success was then immediate and emphatic. Mr. Krehbiel, in the _Tribune_, praised the concerto as \"a splendid composition, so full of poetry, so full of vigor, as to tempt the assertion that it must be placed at the head of all works of its kind produced by either a native or adopted citizen of America\"; and he confessed to having \"derived keener pleasure from the work of the young American than from the experienced and famous Russian\"--Tchaikovsky, whose Fifth Symphony was performed then for the first time in New York. \"Several enthusiastic and unquestionably sincere recalls,\" concluded the writer, \"were the tokens of gratitude and delight with which his townspeople rewarded him.\" A month later MacDowell played the same concerto in Boston, at a Symphony concert, under Mr. Gericke; his performance of it evoked \"rapt attention,\" and \"the very heartiest of plaudits, in which both orchestra and audience joined.\"  In the summer of that year (1889) MacDowell and his wife went abroad. He had been invited to take part in an \"American Concert\" at the Paris Exposition, and on July 12, under Mr. Van der Stucken's direction, he played his second concerto.[4] After a short stay on the continent, he returned with his wife to America.  [4] The rest of the programme, it may be interesting to note, contained Arthur Foote's overture, \"In the Mountains,\" Van der Stucken's suite, \"The Tempest,\" Chadwick's \"Melpomene\" overture, Paine's \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" prelude, a romance and polonaise for violin and orchestra by Henry Holden Huss, and songs by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Dudley Buck, Chadwick, Foote, Van der Stucken. The concert ended with an \"_ouverture festivale sur l'Hymne Américaine_, 'The Star Spangled Banner,'\" by Dudley Buck.  MacDowell found in Boston a considerable field for his activity as pianist and teacher. He took many private pupils, and he made, during the eight years that he remained there, many public appearances in concert. In composition, these years were the most fruitful of his life. He wrote during this period the Concert Study for piano (op. 36); the set of pieces after Victor Hugo's \"Les Orientales\" (op. 37)--\"Clair de lune,\" \"Dans le Hamac,\" \"Danse Andalouse\"; the \"Marionettes\" (op. 38); the \"Twelve Studies\" of op. 39; the \"Six Love Songs\" (op. 40); the two songs for male chorus (op. 41)--\"Cradle Song\" and \"Dance of the Gnomes\"; the orchestral suite in A-minor (op. 42) and its supplement, \"In October\" (op. 42-A);[5] the \"Two Northern Songs\" and \"Barcarolle\" (op. 43 and op. 44) for mixed voices; the \"Sonata Tragica\" (op. 45); the 12 \"Virtuoso Studies\" of op. 46; the \"Eight Songs\" (op. 47); the second (\"Indian\") suite for orchestra; the \"Air\" and \"Rigaudon\" (op. 49) for piano; the \"Sonata Eroica\" (op. 50); and the \"Woodland Sketches\" (op. 51). This output did not contain his most mature and characteristic works--those were to come later, during the last six years of his creative activity; yet the product was in many ways a notable one, and some of it--the two sonatas, the \"Indian\" suite, the songs of op. 47, the \"Woodland Sketches\"--was, if not consistently of his very best, markedly fine and characteristic in quality. This decade (from 1887 to 1897) saw also the publication of all his work contained between his op. 22 (\"Hamlet and Ophelia\") and op. 51 (the \"Woodland Sketches\") with the exception of the symphonic poem \"Lamia,\" which was not published until after his death.  [5] This episode formed part of the suite in its original form, but was not printed until several years after the publication of the rest of the music. The earlier portion, comprising four parts (\"In a Haunted Forest,\" \"Summer Idyll,\" \"The Shepherdess' Song,\" \"Forest Spirits\"), was published in 1891, the supplement in 1893.  Meanwhile his prestige grew steadily. Each new work that he put forth met with a remarkable measure of success, both among the general public and at the hands of many not over-complacent critical appraisers. On January 10, 1890, his \"Lancelot and Elaine\" was played at a Boston Symphony concert under Mr. Nikisch. In September, 1891, his orchestral suite in A-minor (op. 42) was performed for the first time at the Worcester Festival, and a month later it was played in Boston at a Symphony concert under Mr. Nikisch. In November of the same year the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, under Bernhard Listemann, performed for the first time, at the Tremont Theatre, his \"Roland\" pieces, \"The Saracens\" and \"The Lovely Aldâ.\" On the following day--November 6, 1891--he gave his first piano recital, playing, in addition to pieces by Bach, Schubert, Schumann, Templeton Strong, P. Geisler, Alabieff, and Liszt, his own \"Witches' Dance,\" \"Shadow Dance\" (op. 39), \"The Eagle,\" the Étude in F-sharp (op. 36), the Prelude from the first suite, and the fourth of the \"Idyls\" after Goethe. He followed this with a second recital in January, 1892, at which he played, among other things, the \"Winter,\" \"Moonshine,\" and \"The Brook,\" from the \"Four Little Poems\" (op. 32). Discussing the first of these recitals, Mr. Philip Hale (in the _Boston Post_) wrote these words, which have a larger application than their reference to MacDowell: \"No doubt, as a composer, he has studied and mastered form and knows"]]]
