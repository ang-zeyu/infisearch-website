They drove to a rendezvous previously agreed upon with Bill Hayden and gleaned what news the boys had to tell.  Which was no news at all.  Their search had been as barren of results as the sheriff's, and Mary V's eyes, when they turned from face to face, were hard to meet.  Little Curley, who had been Johnny Jewel's especial admirer and champion when that youth was spending his days more or less tumultuously at the Rolling R Ranch, was seen to draw his shirt sleeve hastily across his eyes after he had confronted Mary V for a minute's questioning.  She watched with painful interest a car that came bouncing toward them over the rough trail they had taken.  When it arrived their fears might become a terrible certainty.  Two men occupied the dusty roadster, and neither was Johnny, and their haste implied great urgency.  Mary V weakened to the point of covering her face with her hands as they drew near.  But they were merely reporters anxious for news.  That afternoon other reporters appeared, and the next day an enterprising motion-picture concern had a camera man on the job.  The mystery of the vanished airplane grew with the passing hours.  The desert fairly swarmed with men, and theories were thick as lizards.  On the second night beacon fires were burning on every hilltop, and water was being hauled in barrels to certain rest stations where the searchers could come and recuperate.  Old Sudden achieved some front-page fame himself as a stalwart Napoleon of the desert--which he profanely resented, by the way.  On the third day Mary V was ordered to stay at home.  There were reasons which her father did not care to dwell upon, which made it extremely undesirable that the girl should be present when her lover was discovered.  And, since the search had narrowed to a point where discovery was practically certain within a few hours, Sudden was not to be cajoled or bullied.  Mary V was lying on the porch, wondering dully when the nightmare would end and she would wake up and find life just as it had always been, with Johnny alive and full of fun and ready to argue with her over every little thing.  It seemed grotesquely impossible that her own innocent command that he come to her should result in all this horror.  Upheld at first by a frenzied hope that they should find him, she now dreaded the finding, and refused to reckon the time since she had last heard his voice over the telephone.  Hurt and without water or food on the desert in all that heat--she set her teeth to stifle a groan.  A little while ago when he had been so sure that he could enlist as a flyer, she had shrunk from the thought of his going to war.  Before that, when he had lain unconscious for so many days there in the bedroom behind her; when a trained nurse had stood guard and would not let Mary V so much as look at Johnny, and the doctor had spoken glibly of hope, when his eyes told her how little hope there was, she had suffered terribly.  She had thought that she had touched the depths of worry over Johnny--and she had not begun to know the meaning of the word.  She lay a small, huddled heap of heartache, shrinking from her own thoughts, shrinking from the sight of every one, dazed with terror of what she might hear if any one spoke.  Into this nightmare jingled the telephone bell.  Mary V gave a faint scream and put her hands over her ears.  \"There, there, baby--I'll answer it,\" her mother's voice came soothingly, and Mary V shrank farther down in the hammock cushions.  \"Oh--why--land alive!  Just a minute--hold the line,\" she heard her mother say in a strange, flustered voice.  Then she called, \"Mary V--I guess you better come and--\"  \"Oh, I--_can't_, mommie!  I'll go crazy if I have to hear--\"  \"There, there, baby, it's something you want to hear!\"  Mary V's knees shook under her as she went to the telephone.  Her voice was pinched and feeble when she tried to call the stereotyped hello.  \"Oh, hello, Mary V.  That you?  I just got in, and I thought I'd better call up.  I hear they're out looking for me--\"  Mary V's eyes turned glassy.  She made a faint sound and drooped forward until her forehead rested on the table.  The receiver slid soundlessly into her lap and lay there while Johnny Jewel rattled on hurriedly.  \"--And so after that happened, we were held up till dark getting the landing gear straightened out.  And of course we couldn't fly very well after dark.  And then next morning, after Bland had cleaned out the carburetor--say, it was straight mud in there and the screen was packed solid, so of course she didn't get gas half the time, and that's what ailed her--and when we did start, or was going to start, we found out there wasn't enough gas in the tank to take us home.  So I had to catch an Injun and make him take a note to the nearest station for gas, and wait till he got back with some.  I'd have sent word on to you, but I was in such a darned hurry I forgot--and the Injuns were all scared stiff, and it was only by making them understand I wanted water for the Bird, and nothing else would do.\"  \"Mary V's fainted,\" mommie interrupted him then.  \"I guess it was too sudden, hearing you on the wire when she thought you was dead.  You better wait and call up after awhile when her mind's more settled. She's had an awful hard time.  I'm real glad you're all right, Johnny, but I've got to take care of Mary V now.\"  Johnny's eyes were very wide open when he came out of the telephone booth in the hotel lobby.  That Mary V should faint when she heard his voice sounded rather incredible, but it seemed to confirm the strange intent looks and the flustered manners of every one around that hotel. People seemed to be flocking in from the street and from other parts of the hotel, and that they were gathering to gaze upon him, Johnny Jewel, came with a shock.  Three reporters came at him so impetuously that the foremost man skidded on the polished floor and all but fell.  Bland was plucking at his elbow and whispering, \"You let me handle the publicity, bo!\"  The clerk was staring at him, both palms planted firmly on the desk, and men were pushing up and craning for a look at him.  Johnny whirled suddenly and retreated to the telephone booth, shutting the door tightly behind him.  It was the first time in his life that he had run from any one.  To gain time, he called up the Rolling R Ranch again and managed to get Bedelia, the cook, on the 'phone.  Bedelia was perfectly willing to tell all she knew, and she appeared to know a great deal.  Johnny held the receiver to his ear until his elbow cramped, and said \"uh-huh\" once in a while, and wondered how much Bedelia was exaggerating the truth. As a matter of fact Bedelia was giving him a conservative history of the past three days and, indirectly, she was explaining the crowd in the lobby behind him.  Telephone booths are not any too comfortable on a hot day, and Johnny emerged rather limp and sober.  He edged in to where Bland was gesticulating in the center of a group that seemed to be drinking in his words eagerly.  \"I'm going on to the ranch, Bland,\" he said shortly.  \"Jar loose here and come help get the machine ready.\"  \"In a minute, bo.  As I was saying--\"  \"Ah--I hear you had quite an adventure, Mr. Jewel, down among the Indians with your airplane.  Now, just where--\"  \"I'm in a hurry,\" Johnny hedged.  \"I don't know anything about any adventure.  We had a little carburetor trouble, and had to wait for gas before we could get back.  That's all.\"  He grabbed Bland firmly by one arm and hustled him outside, where men were seemingly waiting far his appearance.  \"Oh, Mr. Jewel!  I wish you'd tell me--\"  \"I'm in a hurry!  Good golly, folks seem to think talking is all there is to do in this world!  Come on, Bland.\"  He hurried on, his mind absorbed in grasping the full significance of Bedelia's excited report of events at the Rolling R and this curious crowd that gaped at him. The thought of Mary V lying unconscious, stricken by the sound of his voice over the telephone, nagged at him persistently and unpleasantly. He had not told Bedelia that he was coming, and now he feared that his unheralded appearance might be another shock to Mary V; but he would not take the time to go back and warn her, for all that.  Instead, he walked a little faster to where his plane was waiting.  \"I think you're making a bad play, bo--duckin' out when all them newspaper guys are hot after dope on us,\"  Bland expostulated while he drilled along beside his boss.  \"I give 'em some scarehead stuff, but they'd lap up a lot more.  We can get a lot of valuable publicity right now if we play 'em right.  I give 'em that gawd stuff for a start-off, and I made--\"  \"Shut up and save your breath,\" snapped Johnny.  \"I'm not chasing up any newspaper notoriety now.\"  \"Well, it'd be better business if yah did, bo--I'll say it would.  Why, it's free advertising we couldn't have pulled off on a bet, if we'd tried to frame it.  Absolutely not.  Well, mebby your duckin' out right now is a good play, too.  It'll keep 'em chasin' yuh for more--and I'll say that's about the only way to handle them smart guys.  Oncet you chase them, the stuff's off.  You can bust your spine in four different places and wreck your machine, and mebby get a four- or five-line notice down in a corner next the dentist ads.  It's worse, too, since the war begun.  There ain't no more chance, hardly, of getting front-page publicity.  Say, a couple of 'em took your picture.  D' yuh know that?\"  \"No, and I don't care,\" Johnny retorted.  Just now nothing mattered save getting to the Rolling R as soon as possible and stopping that idiotic search for him.  He hustled Bland around to such good purpose that by the time the reporters had trailed him to the hangar he was already in his seat and was barking \"Contact!\" at Bland, who was unhappily turning "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14488"],["title","Elsie's Kith and Kin (#0)"],["body","ELSIE'S KITH AND KIN  by  MARTHA FINLEY  1886        CHAPTER I.  \"O married love! each heart shall own;   Where two congenial souls unite, Thy golden chains inlaid with down,   Thy lamp with heaven's own splendor bright.\" LANGHORNE.   \"There, there, little woman! light of my eyes, and core of my heart! if you don't stop this pretty soon, I very much fear I shall be compelled to join you,\" Edward Travilla said, between a laugh and a sigh, drawing Zoe closer to him, laying her head against his breast, and kissing her tenderly on lip and cheek and brow. \"I shall begin to think you already regret having staid behind with me.\"  \"No, no, no!\" she cried, dashing away her tears, then putting her arms about his neck, and returning his caresses with ardor of affection. \"Dear Ned, you know you're more than all the rest of the world to your silly little wife. But it seems lonely just at first, to have them all gone at once, especially mamma; and to think we'll not see her again for months! I do believe you'd cry yourself, if you were a girl.\"  \"Altogether likely,\" he said, laughing, and giving her another hug; \"but, being a man, it wouldn't do at all to allow my feelings to overcome me in that manner. Besides, with my darling little wife still left me, I'd be an ungrateful wretch to repine at the absence of other dear ones.\"  \"What a neat little speech, Ned!\" she exclaimed, lifting her head to look up into his face, and laughing through her tears--for her eyes had filled again. \"Well, you know I can't help feeling a little lonely and sad just at first; but, for all that, I wouldn't for the world be anywhere else than here in your arms:\" and with a sigh of content and thankfulness, she let her pretty head drop upon his breast again.  \"My darling! may it ever be to you the happiest place on earth! God helping me, I shall always try to make it so,\" he said, with a sudden change to gravity, and in low, moved tones.  \"My dear, dear husband!\" she murmured, clinging closer to him.  Then, wiping her eyes, \"I sha'n't cry any more; for, if I'm not the happiest woman in the world, I ought to be. And what a nice time we shall have together, dear Ned! each wholly devoted to the other all winter long. I have it all planned out: while you are out about the plantation in the mornings, I'll attend to my housekeeping and my studies; and in the afternoons and evenings,--after I've recited,--we can write our letters, or entertain ourselves and each other with music or books; you can read to me while I work, you know.\"  \"Yes: a book is twice as enjoyable read in that way--sharing the pleasure with you,\" he said, softly stroking her hair, and smiling down into her eyes.  \"Especially if it is a good story, or a bit of lovely poetry,\" she added.  \"Yes,\" he said: \"we'll have both those in turn, and some solid reading besides.\"  \"I don't like solid reading,\" she returned, with a charming pout.  \"One may cultivate a taste for it, I think,\" he answered pleasantly.  \"But you can't cultivate what you haven't got,\" she objected.  \"True enough,\" he said, laughing. \"Well, then, we'll try to get a little first, and cultivate it carefully afterward. I must go now, love,\" he added, releasing her: \"the men need some directions from me, in regard to their work.\"  \"And the women some from me,\" said Zoe. \"Oh! you needn't laugh, Ned,\" shaking her finger at him, as he turned in the doorway to give her an amused glance: \"perhaps some of these days you'll find out that I am really an accomplished housewife, capable of giving orders and directions too.\"  \"No doubt, my dear; for I am already proud of you in that capacity,\" he said, throwing her a smiling kiss, then hurrying away.  Zoe summoned Aunt Dicey, the housekeeper, gave her orders for the day, and the needed supplies from pantry and storeroom, they went to the sewing-room, to give some directions to Christine and Alma.  She lingered there for a little, trying on a morning-dress they were making for her, then repaired to her boudoir, intent upon beginning her studies, which had been rather neglected of late, in the excitement of the preparations for the departure of the greater part of the family for a winter at Viamede.  But she had scarcely taken out her books, when the sound of wheels on the avenue attracted her attention; and glancing from the window, she saw the Roselands carriage draw up at the front entrance, and Ella Conly alight from it, and run up the veranda steps.  \"There, I'll not do much studying to-day, I'm afraid,\" said Zoe, half aloud; \"for, even if it's only a call she has come for, she'll not leave under an hour.\"  She hastily replaced the books in the drawer from which she had taken them,--for she had a feeling, only half acknowledged even to herself, of repugnance to having Ella know of her studies,--Ella, who had graduated from boarding-school, and evidently felt herself thoroughly educated,--and hurried down to meet and welcome her guest.  \"I told Cal and Art, I thought you'd be sure to feel dreadfully lonely to-day, after seeing everybody but Ned start off on a long journey, and so I'd come and spend the day with you,\" said Ella, when the two had exchanged kisses, and inquiries after each other's health.  \"It was very kind and thoughtful in you,\" returned Zoe, leading the way into the parlor usually occupied by the family, where an open wood fire blazed cheerily on the hearth.  \"Take this easy-chair, won't you?\" she said, wheeling it a little nearer the grate; \"and Dinah shall carry away your wraps when it suits you to doff them. I wish cousins Cal and Art would invite themselves to dine with us too.\"  \"Art's very busy just now,\" said Ella: \"there's a good deal of sickness, and I don't believe he's spent a whole night at home for the last week or more.\"  \"Dear me! I wouldn't be a doctor for any thing, nor a doctor's wife!\" exclaimed Zoe.  \"Well, I don't know: there's something to be said on both sides of that question,\" laughed Ella. \"I can tell you, Art would make a mighty good husband; and it's very handy, in ease of sickness, to have the doctor in the house.\"  \"Yes; but, according to your account, he's generally somewhere else than in his own house,\" returned Zoe playfully.  Ella laughed. \"Yes,\" she said, \"doctors do have a hard life; but, if you say so to Art, he always says he has never regretted having chosen the medical profession, because it affords so many opportunities for doing good. It's plain he makes that the business of his life. I'm proud of Art. I don't believe there's a better man anywhere. I was sick last summer, and you wouldn't believe how kindly he nursed me.\"  \"You can't tell me any thing about him that I should think too good to believe,\" said Zoe. \"He's our family doctor, you remember; and, of course, we are all attached to him on that account, as well as because of the relationship.\"  \"Yes, to be sure. There, Dinah, you may carry away my hat and cloak,\" Ella said, divesting herself of them as she spoke, \"but leave the satchel. I brought my fancy-work, Zoe: one has to be industrious now, as Christmas is coming. I decided to embroider a pair of slippers for each of my three brothers. Walter does not expect to get home; so I made his first, as they had to travel so far. I'm nearly done with Art's, and then I have Cal's to do.\"  \"Oh, how pretty!\" exclaimed Zoe, examining the work: \"and that's a new stitch; won't you teach it to me?\"  \"Yes, indeed, with pleasure. And I want you to teach me how to crochet that lace I saw you making the other day. I thought it so pretty.\"  The two spent a pleasant morning chatting together over their fancy-work, saying nothing very wise, perhaps, but neither did they say any thing harmful: an innocent jest now and again, something--usually laudatory--about some member of the family connection, and remarks and directions about their work, formed the staple of their talk.  \"Oh! how did it come that you and Ned staid behind when all the rest went to Viamede for the winter?\" asked Ella.  \"Business kept my husband, and love for him and his society kept me,\" returned Zoe, with a look and smile that altogether belied any suspicion Ella might have had that she was fretting over the disappointment.  \"Didn't you want to go?\"  \"Yes, indeed, if Edward could have gone with me; but any place with him is better than any other without him.\"  \"Well, I don't believe I should have been willing to stay behind, even in your place. I've always had a longing to spend a winter there visiting my sister Isa, and my cousins Elsie and Molly. Cal and Art say, perhaps one or both of them may go on to spend two or three weeks this winter; and in that case I shall go along.\"  \"Perhaps we may go at the same time, and what a nice party we will make!\" said Zoe. \"There,\" glancing from the window, \"I see my husband coming, and I want to run out and speak to him. Will you excuse me a moment?\" and scarcely waiting for a reply, she ran gayly away.  Meeting Edward on the threshold, \"I have no lessons to recite this time,\" she said; \"but you are not to scold, because I've been prevented from studying by company. Ella is spending the day with me.\"  \"Ah! I hope you have had a pleasant time together--not too much troubled by fear of a lecture from the old tyrant who bears your lessons,\" he said laughingly, as he bent his head to press a kiss of ardent affection upon the rosy lips she held up to him.  \"No,\" she laughed in return: \"I'm not a bit afraid of him.\"  Zoe had feared the hours when Edward was unavoidably absent from her side would be very lonely now while the other members of the Ion family were away; but she did not find it so; her studies, and the work of making various pretty things for Christmas gifts, keeping her very busy.  And, when he was with her, time flew on very rapid wings. She had grown quite industrious, and generally plied her needle in the evenings while he read or talked to her. But occasionally he would take the embroidery, or whatever it was, out of"]]]
