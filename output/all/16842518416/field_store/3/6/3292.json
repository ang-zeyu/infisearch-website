Not long after the Civil War the attempt was made to perfect Isigny. The curd was carefully prepared according to an original formula, washed and rubbed and set aside to come of age. But when it did, alas, it was more like Limburger than Camembert, and since good domestic Limburger was then a dime a pound, obviously it wouldn't pay off. Yet in shape the newborn resembled Camembert, although it was much larger. So they cut it down and named it after the delicate French Creme d'lsigny.   Jack, California Jack and Monterey Jack  Jack was first known as Monterey cheese from the California county where it originated. Then it was called Jack for short, and only now takes its full name after sixty years of popularity on the West Coast. Because it is little known in the East and has to be shipped so far, it commands the top Cheddar price.  Monterey Jack is a stirred curd Cheddar without any annatto coloring. It is sweeter than most and milder when young, but it gets sharper with age and more expensive because of storage costs.   Liederkranz  No native American cheese has been so widely ballyhooed, and so deservedly, as Liederkranz, which translates \"Wreath of Song.\"  Back in the gay, inventive nineties, Emil Frey, a young delicatessen keeper in New York, tried to please some bereft customers by making an imitation of Bismarck Schlosskäse. This was imperative because the imported German cheese didn't stand up during the long sea trip and Emil's customers, mostly members of the famous Liederkranz singing society, didn't feel like singing without it. But Emil's attempts at imitation only added indigestion to their dejection, until one day--_fabelhaft!_ One of those cheese dream castles in Spain came true. He turned out a tawny, altogether golden, tangy and mellow little marvel that actually was an improvement on Bismarck's old Schlosskäse. Better than Brick, it was a deodorized Limburger, both a man's cheese and one that cheese-conscious women adored.  Emil named it \"Wreath of Song\" for the Liederkranz customers. It soon became as internationally known as tabasco from Texas or Parisian Camembert which it slightly resembles. Borden's bought out Frey in 1929 and they enjoy telling the story of a G.I. who, to celebrate V-E Day in Paris, sent to his family in Indiana, only a few miles from the factory at Van Wert, Ohio, a whole case of what he had learned was \"the finest cheese France could make.\" And when the family opened it, there was Liederkranz.  Another deserved distinction is that of being sandwiched in between two foreign immortals in the following recipe:    Schnitzelbank Pot  1 ripe Camembert cheese 1 Liederkranz 1/8 pound imported Roquefort 1/4 pound butter 1 tablespoon flour 1 cup cream 1/2 cup finely chopped olives 1/4 cup canned pimiento A sprinkling of cayenne       Depending on whether or not you like the edible rind of Camembert      and Liederkranz, you can leave it on, scrape any thick part off,      or remove it all. Mash the soft creams together with the      Roquefort, butter and flour, using a silver fork. Put the mix      into an enameled pan, for anything with a metal surface will      turn the cheese black in cooking.       Stir in the cream and keep stirring until you have a smooth,      creamy sauce. Strain through sieve or cheesecloth, and mix in the      olives and pimiento thoroughly. Sprinkle well with cayenne and      put into a pot to mellow for a few days, or much longer.  The name _Schnitzelbank_ comes from \"school bench,\" a game. This snappy-sweet pot is specially suited to a beer party and stein songs. It is also the affinity-spread with rye and pumpernickel, and may be served in small sandwiches or on crackers, celery and such, to make appetizing tidbits for cocktails, tea, or cider.  Like the trinity of cheeses that make it, the mixture is eaten best at room temperature, when its flavor is fullest. If kept in the refrigerator, it should be taken out a couple of hours before serving. Since it is a natural cheese mixture, which has gone through no process or doping with preservative, it will not keep more than two weeks. This mellow-sharp mix is the sort of ideal the factory processors shoot at with their olive-pimiento abominations. Once you've potted your own, you'll find it gives the same thrill as garnishing your own Liptauer.   Minnesota Blue  The discovery of sandstone caves in the bluffs along the Mississippi, in and near the Twin Cities of Minnesota, has established a distinctive type of Blue cheese named for the state. Although the Roquefort process of France is followed and the cheese is inoculated in the same way by mold from bread, it can never equal the genuine imported, marked with its red-sheep brand, because the milk used in Minnesota Blue is cow's milk, and the caves are sandstone instead of limestone. Yet this is an excellent, Blue cheese in its own right.   Pineapple  Pineapple cheese is named after its shape rather than its flavor, although there are rumors that some pineapple flavor is noticeable near the oiled rind. This flavor does not penetrate through to the Cheddar center. Many makers of processed cheese have tampered with the original, so today you can't be sure of anything except getting a smaller size every year or two, at a higher price. Originally six pounds, the Pineapple has shrunk to nearly six ounces. The proper bright-orange, oiled and shellacked surface is more apt to be a sickly lemon.  Always an ornamental cheese, it once stood in state on the side-board under a silver bell also made to represent a pineapple. You cut a top slice off the cheese, just as you would off the fruit, and there was a rose-colored, fine-tasting, mellow-hard cheese to spoon out with a special silver cheese spoon or scoop. Between meals the silver top was put on the silver holder and the oiled and shellacked rind kept the cheese moist. Even when the Pineapple was eaten down to the rind the shell served as a dunking bowl to fill with some salubrious cold Fondue or salad.  Made in the same manner as Cheddar with the curd cooked harder, Pineapple's distinction lies in being hung in a net that makes diamond-shaped corrugations on the surface, simulating the sections of the fruit. It is a pioneer American product with almost a century and a half of service since Lewis M. Norton conceived it in 1808 in Litchfield County, Connecticut. There in 1845 he built a factory and made a deserved fortune out of his decorative ingenuity with what before had been plain, unromantic yellow or store cheese.  Perhaps his inspiration came from cone-shaped Cheshire in old England, also called Pineapple cheese, combined with the hanging up of Provolones in Italy that leaves the looser pattern of the four sustaining strings.    Sage, Vermont Sage and Vermont State  The story of Sage cheese, or green cheese as it was called originally, shows the several phases most cheeses have gone through, from their simple, honest beginnings to commercialization, and sometimes back to the real thing.  The English _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_ has an early Sage recipe:       This is a species of cream cheese made by adding sage leaves and      greening to the milk. A very good receipt for it is given thus:      Bruise the tops of fresh young red sage leaves with an equal      quantity of spinach leaves and squeeze out the juice. Add this to      the extract of rennet and stir into the milk as much as your      taste may deem sufficient. Break the curd when it comes, salt it,      fill the vat high with it, press for a few hours, and then turn      the cheese every day.  _Fancy Cheese in America, lay_ Charles A. Publow, records the commercialization of the cheese mentioned above, a century or two later, in 1910:       Sage cheese is another modified form of the Cheddar variety. Its      distinguishing features are a mottled green color and a sage      flavor. The usual method of manufacture is as follows: One-third      of the total amount of milk is placed in a vat by itself and      colored green by the addition of eight to twelve ounces of      commercial sage color to each 1,000 pounds of milk. If green corn      leaves (unavailable in England) or other substances are used for      coloring, the amounts will vary accordingly. The milk is then      made up by the regular Cheddar method, as is also the remaining      two-thirds, in a separate vat. At the time of removing the whey      the green and white curds are mixed. Some prefer, however, to mix      the curds at the time of milling, as a more distinct color is      secured. After milling, the sage extract flavoring is sprayed      over the curd with an atomizer. The curd is then salted and      pressed into the regular Cheddar shapes and sizes.       A very satisfactory Sage cheese is made at the New York State      College of Agriculture by simply dropping green coloring, made      from the leaves of corn and spinach, upon the curd, after      milling. An even green mottling is thus easily secured without      additional labor. Sage flavoring extract is sprayed over the curd      by an atomizer. One-half ounce of flavoring is usually sufficient      for a hundred pounds of curd and can be secured from dairy supply      houses.  A modern cheese authority reported on the current (1953) method:       Instead of sage leaves, or tea prepared from them, at present the      cheese is flavored with oil of Dalmatian wild sage because it has      the sharpest flavor. This piny oil, thujone, is diluted with      water, 250 parts to one, and either added to the milk or sprayed      over the curds, one-eighth ounce for 500 quarts of milk.  In scouting around for a possible maker of the real thing today, we wrote to Vrest Orton of Vermont, and got this reply:       Sage cheese is one of the really indigenous and best native      Vermont products. So far as I know, there is only one factory      making it and that is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],["title","The Complete Book of Cheese (#6)"],["body","friend, George Crowley's. He makes a      limited amount for my Vermont Country Store. It is the fine      old-time full cream cheese, flavored with real sage.       On this hangs a tale. Some years ago I couldn't get enough sage      cheese (we never can) so I asked a Wisconsin cheesemaker if he      would make some. Said he would but couldn't at that time--because      the alfalfa wasn't ripe. I said, \"What in hell has alfalfa got to      do with sage cheese?\" He said, \"Well, we flavor the sage cheese      with a synthetic sage flavor and then throw in some pieces of      chopped-up alfalfa to make it look green.\"       So I said to hell with that and the next time I saw George      Crowley I told him the story and George said, \"We don't use      synthetic flavor, alfalfa or anything like that.\"       \"Then what do you use, George?\" I inquired.       \"We use real sage.\"       \"Why?\"       \"Well, because it's cheaper than that synthetic stuff.\"  The genuine Vermont Sage arrived. Here are our notes on it:       Oh, wilderness were Paradise enow! My taste buds come to full      flower with the Sage. There's a slight burned savor recalling      smoked cheese, although not related in any way. Mildly resinous      like that Near East one packed in pine, suggesting the well-saged      dressing of a turkey. A round mouthful of luscious mellowness,      with a bouquet--a snapping reminder to the nose. And there's just      a soupçon of new-mown hay above the green freckles of herb to      delight the eye and set the fancy free. So this is the _véritable      vert_, green cheese--the moon is made of it! _Vert véritable._ A      general favorite with everybody who ever tasted it, for      generations of lusty crumblers.   Old-Fashioned Vermont State Store Cheese  We received from savant Vrest Orton another letter, together with some Vermont store cheese and some crackers.       This cheese is our regular old-fashioned store cheese--it's been      in old country stores for generations and we have been pioneers      in spreading the word about it. It is, of course, a natural aged      cheese, no processing, no fussing, no fooling with it. It's made      the same way it was back in 1870, by the old-time Colby method      which makes a cheese which is not so dry as Cheddar and also has      holes in it, something like Swiss. Also, it ages faster.       Did you know that during the last part of the nineteenth century      and part of the twentieth, Vermont was the leading cheesemaking      state in the Union? When I was a lad, every town in Vermont had      one or more cheese factories. Now there are only two left--not      counting any that make process. Process isn't cheese!       The crackers are the old-time store cracker--every Vermonter      used to buy a big barrel once a year to set in the buttery and      eat. A classic dish is crackers, broken up in a bowl of cold      milk, with a hunk of Vermont cheese like this on the side. Grand      snack, grand midnight supper, grand anything. These crackers are      not sweet, not salt, and as such make a good base for      anything--swell with clam chowder, also with toasted cheese....   Tillamook  It takes two pocket-sized, but thick, yellow volumes to record the story of Oregon's great Tillamook. _The Cheddar Box_, by Dean Collins, comes neatly boxed and bound in golden cloth stamped with a purple title, like the rind of a real Tillamook. Volume I is entitled _Cheese Cheddar_, and Volume II is a two-pound Cheddar cheese labeled Tillamook and molded to fit inside its book jacket. We borrowed Volume I from a noted _littérateur_, and never could get him to come across with Volume II. We guessed its fate, however, from a note on the flyleaf of the only tome available: \"This is an excellent cheese, full cream and medium sharp, and a unique set of books in which Volume II suggests Bacon's: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.'\"   Wisconsin Longhorn  Since we began this chapter with all-American Cheddars, it is only fitting to end with Wisconsin Longhorn, a sort of national standard, even though it's not nearly so fancy or high-priced as some of the regional natives that can't approach its enormous output. It's one of those all-purpose round cheeses that even taste round in your mouth. We are specially partial to it.  Most Cheddars are named after their states. Yet, putting all of these thirty-seven states together, they produce only about half as much as Wisconsin alone.  Besides Longhorn, in Wisconsin there are a dozen regional competitors ranging from White Twin Cheddar, to which no annatto coloring has been added, through Green Bay cheese to Wisconsin Redskin and Martha Washington Aged, proudly set forth by P.H. Kasper of Bear Creek, who is said to have \"won more prizes in forty years than any ten cheesemakers put together.\"  To help guarantee a market for all this excellent apple-pie cheese, the Wisconsin State Legislature made a law about it, recognizing the truth of Eugene Field's jingle:      Apple pie without cheese     Is like a kiss without a squeeze.  Small matter in the Badger State when the affinity is made legal and the couple lawfully wedded in Statute No. 160,065. It's still in force:       _Butter and cheese to be served._ Every person, firm or      corporation duly licensed to operate a hotel or restaurant shall      serve with each meal for which a charge of twenty-five cents or      more is made, at least two-thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin butter      and two-thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin cheese.  Besides Longhorn, Wisconsin leads in Limburger. It produces so much Swiss that the state is sometimes called Swissconsin.     [Illustration]  _Chapter Five_  Sixty-five Sizzling Rabbits        That nice little smoky room at the \"Salutation,\" which is even      now continually presenting itself to my recollection, with all      its associated train of pipes, egg-hot, welsh-rabbits,      metaphysics and poetry.       Charles Lamb, IN A LETTER TO COLERIDGE   Unlike the beginning of the classical Jugged Hare recipe: \"First catch your hare!\" we modern Rabbit-hunters start off with \"First catch your Cheddar!\" And some of us go so far as to smuggle in formerly forbidden _fromages_ such as Gruyère, Neufchâtel, Parmesan, and mixtures thereof. We run the gamut of personal preferences in selecting the Rabbit cheese itself, from old-time American, yellow or store cheese, to Coon and Canadian-smoked, though all of it is still Cheddar, no matter how you slice it.  Then, too, guests are made to run the gauntlet of all-American trimmings from pin-money pickles to peanut butter, succotash and maybe marshmallows; we add mustard, chill, curry, tabasco and sundry bottled red devils from the grocery store, to add pep and piquance to the traditional cayenne and black pepper. This results in Rabbits that are out of focus, out of order and out of this world.  Among modern sins of omission, the Worcestershire sauce is left out by braggarts who aver that they can take it or leave it. And, in these degenerate days, when it comes to substitutions for the original beer or stale pale ale, we find the gratings of great Cheddars wet down with mere California sherry or even ginger ale--yet so far, thank goodness, no Cokes. And there's tomato juice out of a can into the Rum Turn Tiddy, and sometimes celery soup in place of milk or cream.  In view of all this, we can only look to the standard cookbooks for salvation. These are mostly compiled by women, our thoughtful mothers, wives and sweethearts who have saved the twin Basic Rabbits for us. If it weren't for these Fanny Farmers, the making of a real aboriginal Welsh Rabbit would be a lost art--lost in sporting male attempts to improve upon the original.  The girls are still polite about the whole thing and protectively pervert the original spelling of \"Rabbit\" to \"Rarebit\" in their culinary guides. We have heard that once a club of ladies in high society tried to high-pressure the publishers of Mr. Webster's dictionary to change the old spelling in their favor. Yet there is a lot to be said for this more genteel and appetizing rendering of the word, for the Welsh masterpiece is, after all, a very rare bit of cheesemongery, male or female.  Yet in dealing with \"Rarebits\" the distaff side seldom sets down more than the basic Adam and Eve in a whole Paradise of Rabbits: No. 1, the wild male type made with beer, and No. 2, the mild female made with milk. Yet now that the chafing dish has come back to stay, there's a flurry in the Rabbit warren and the new cooking encyclopedias give up to a dozen variants. Actually there are easily half a gross of valid ones in current esteem.  The two basic recipes are differentiated by the liquid ingredient, but both the beer and the milk are used only one way--warm, or anyway at room temperature. And again for the two, there is but one traditional cheese--Cheddar, ripe, old or merely aged from six months onward. This is also called American, store, sharp, Rabbit, yellow, beer, Wisconsin Longhorn, mouse, and even rat.  The seasoned, sapid Cheddar-type, so indispensable, includes dozens of varieties under different names, regional or commercial. These are easily identified as sisters-under-the-rinds by all five senses:       sight: Golden yellow and mellow to the eye. It's one of those      round cheeses that also tastes round in the mouth.       hearing: By thumping, a cheese-fancier, like a melon-picker,      can tell if a Cheddar is rich, ripe and ready for the Rabbit.      When you hear your dealer say, \"It's six months old or more,\"      enough said.       smell: A scent as fresh as that of the daisies and herbs the      mother milk cow munched \"will hang round it still.\" Also a slight      beery savor.       touch: Crumbly--a caress to the fingers.       taste: The quintessence of this fivefold test. Just cuddle a      crumb with your tongue and if "]]]
