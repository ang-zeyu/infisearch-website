Finally, being a sensible woman, she decided to do nothing. Had she known it before, or learned the truth by other means, she would have refused absolutely to touch Herbert Penfold's money; but it would be indeed a poor return for his kindness were she now, when he was ill and feeble, and was about to bestow still further benefits upon her, to refuse to permit him any longer to aid her. She wished, as she read the letter over again, that he had expressed some desire to see her. She should have liked to have thanked him in person, to have told him how grateful she felt for his care and kindness, to have taken his hand again if but for a minute.  But he had expressed no wish for a meeting, had never all these years made an effort to see her. She could read in the wording of the letter that he had been principally deterred from making any attempt to see her by the feeling that he had entirely forfeited her regard, and had offended her beyond chance of forgiveness. And had she been asked the day before she would doubtless have replied that she had no wish whatever ever again to meet Herbert Penfold; whereas now she felt almost aggrieved that he should express no wish to meet her, should have stayed away so long without making one effort to bring about reconciliation.  \"Of all faults that a man can have,\" she said pettishly, \"I do not think there's one so detestable as that of self-distrust. Why could he not have said ten years ago, 'I behaved badly, Mary; I treated you abominably; but forgive me and forget. I was not wholly to blame, except that I allowed others to come between us?' If he had come and said that, we could at least have been good friends. I have no patience with men who cannot stand up for themselves. Now, how much shall I tell Ralph?\" and she again read the letter through.  \"Ralph,\" she said when he came in to dinner, \"you remember that letter I had this morning?\"  \"Yes, I know, mother; the one that made you turn so white. You said it was from an old friend, though why a letter from an old friend should upset any one I can't make out. What was it about, mother?\"  \"Well, my boy, it contains a pleasant piece of news. Mr. Penfold, that is the name of the writer, was a friend of my family. He knew me long ago when we were young people, and at one time it seemed likely that we should be married. However, as you know, that never took place. However, it seems, as he says by his letter, that he has never altogether forgotten me, and he intends to help you on in life if you turn out as he would like to see you. He wishes you to go down to stay with him when your holidays begin.\"  \"That sounds nice,\" Ralph said; \"and if he has got any boys about my own age it will be pleasant.\"  \"He has no children, Ralph. He is what you may call an old bachelor, and lives with his sisters--or, rather, they live with him.\"  \"That does not sound very cheerful, mother. An old gentleman with two old ladies alone in the house can't make much fun.\"  \"He is not an old gentleman, Ralph,\" Mrs. Conway said almost angrily. \"I told you we were young people together. Still it may not be very lively for you, but you must put up with that. He evidently means to be very kind to you, and it will be of great advantage to you going down to stay with him.\"  \"But what are you going to do with yourself, mother, all alone here? I think he might have asked you as well as me.\"  \"I shall do very well, Ralph. I have plenty of friends here.\"  \"Where does Mr. Penfold live, mother?\"  \"Down in Dorsetshire. It is a very nice place, and only about a mile from the sea. But, as I say, I do not expect you will find it lively; but that you mustn't mind. It will be a very good thing for you, and will be well worth your while putting up with a little dullness for a time. Mr. Penfold is one of the kindest of men, but I do not think you will like his sisters much. Certainly you will not unless they are a good deal changed from what they were as I remember them. Still you must try to get on with them as well as you can, and I dare say you will find some pleasant companions in the neighborhood. I am sure you will do your best when I tell you that I am most anxious for many reasons that Mr. Penfold should like you.\"  \"Of course I will do my best, mother, though I must say that the lookout is not, according to your description, a very cheerful one, and I would a deal rather stop at home with you.\"  \"We can't always do exactly as we like, Ralph; though that is a lesson you have as yet to learn. What day did you say your holidays began?\"  \"Next Monday week, mother. But I do hope I may have two or three days' sailing with Joe Knight the fisherman before I go.\"  \"Mr. Penfold says he will be glad to see you as soon as your holidays begin, Ralph; still I suppose a day or two will make no difference, so we will settle that you shall go on Friday. As you go down to school this afternoon you had better tell Rogerson the tailor to come up this evening to measure you for a suit of clothes. You must look decent when you go down; and you know except your Sunday suit, you have got nothing fit to wear in such a house as that.\"  \"I am afraid it's going to be a horrible nuisance altogether,\" Ralph said ruefully. \"However, I suppose it's got to be done as you say so, mother; though it's hard breaking in on my holidays like that. He might just as well have asked me in school-time. One could have put up with it ever so much better if it took one out of old Harper's clutches for a bit. How long am I to stay there?\"  \"I expect the greater part of your holidays, Ralph. I think he wants to get to know all about you.\"  Ralph groaned loudly. \"He may intend very kindly,\" he said; \"but I wish he would keep his good intentions to himself.\"  \"You think so now,\" Mrs. Conway said with a smile. \"You won't think so when you are in the army, but will find a little extra allowance or a tip now and then very welcome.\"  \"I dare say I shall, mother,\" Ralph said, brightening. \"Anyhow, if the old gentleman--that is to say, the gentleman--takes it into his head to make me an allowance, it will take me off your hands, and I shall not be always feeling that I am an awful expense to you. All right, mother. I think I can promise that I will be on my best behavior, and will try hard to get on even with his sisters. I wish he had asked Phil Landrey to go down with me. Two fellows can get on anywhere.\"  \"I should have very little hope of your making a good impression if you went there with your friend Phil,\" Mrs. Conway said, smiling. \"I can believe in your good conduct while you are alone, but I should have no hopes whatever of you if you and he were together.\"  \"But how am I to go, mother? It seems such a tremendous way from here down into Dorsetshire.\"  \"I have not thought anything about it yet, Ralph; but probably Mr. Penfold will give some instructions as to your journey when he hears from me that you are coming.\"     CHAPTER II.  A COUNTRY VISIT.   When Ralph had gone off to school again Mrs. Conway sat down to answer the letter--by no means an easy task--and she sat with the paper before her for a long time before she began. At last, with an air of desperation, she dipped her pen into the ink and began:      \"MY DEAR HERBERT PENFOLD: It is difficult to answer such a letter     as yours--to say all one feels without saying too much; to express     the gratitude with which one is full, but of which one feels that     you do not desire the expression. First, a word as to the past.     Now that it is irreparable, why should I not speak freely? We were     the victims of a mistake! You were misled respecting me. I     foolishly resented the line you took, failed to make sufficient     allowances for your surroundings, and even doubted a love that     seemed to me to be so easily shaken. Thus my pride was, perhaps,     as much responsible for what happened as your too easy credence of     tales to my disadvantage. At any rate, believe me that I have     cherished no such feelings as those with which you credit me     toward you. Now that I know the truth, I can only regret that your     life has been, as you say, spoiled, by what can but be called a     fatal misunderstanding.      \"Next, I must thank you, although you make no allusion to it in     your letter, for your kindness during past years. Of these,     believe me, I never suspected that you were the author; and I need     hardly say how deeply I have been touched at finding that the hand     to which I and my boy owe so much is that of Herbert Penfold. Of     this I will say no more. I leave you to picture my feelings and my     gratitude. Also, most warmly I thank you for your intentions     regarding my boy. He will be ready to come to you on Friday week.     I suppose his best way will be to go by coach to London and then     down to you, or he could take passage perhaps in a coaster. He is     very fond of the sea.      \"We had settled that he should enter the army; but of course I     consider that nothing will be decided on this or any other point     as to his future until I know your wishes on the matter. Lastly,     dear Herbert, believe me that the news that you have given me     concerning your state of health has caused me deep sorrow, and I     earnestly hope and trust that the doctors may be mistaken in your     case, that you may have a long life before you, and that life may     be happier in the future than it has been in the past.      \"I remain,      \"Your grateful and affectionate      \"MARY CONWAY.\"  A fortnight later Ralph Conway took his place on the outside of the coach for London. As to the visit to this unknown friend of his mother, he anticipated no pleasure from it whatever; but at the same time the journey itself was delightful to him. He had never during his remembrance been further away from Dover than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14313"],["title","One of the 28th: A Tale of Waterloo (#4)"],["body","bury; and the trip before him was in those days a more important one than a journey half over Europe would be at the present time. In his pocket he carried a piece of paper, on which his mother had carefully written down the instructions contained in the letter she had received in answer to her own from Herbert Penfold. Sewn up in the lining of his waistcoat were five guineas, so that in case the coach was stopped by highwaymen, or any other misfortune happened, he would still be provided with funds for continuing his journey.  Under the seat was a small basket filled with sandwiches, and his head ought to have been equally well filled with the advice his mother had given him as to his behavior at Penfold Hall. As his place had been booked some days before, he had the advantage of an outside seat. Next to him was a fat woman, who was going up to town, as she speedily informed her fellow-passengers, to meet her husband, who was captain of a whaler.  \"I see in the _Gazette_ of to-day,\" she said, \"as his ship was signaled off Deal yesterday, and with this ere wind he will be up at the docks to-morrow; so off I goes. He's been away nigh eighteen months; and I know what men is. Why, bless you, if I wasn't there to meet him when he steps ashore, as likely as not he would meet with friends and go on the spree, and I shouldn't hear of him for a week; and a nice hole that would make in his earnings. Young man, you are scrouging me dreadful! Can't you get a little further along.\"  \"It seems to me, ma'am, that it is you who are scrouging me,\" Ralph replied. \"This rail is almost cutting into my side now.\"  \"Well, we must live and let live!\" the woman said philosophically. \"You may thank your stars nature hasn't made you as big as I am. Little people have their advantages. But we can't have everything our own way. That's what I tells my Jim; he is always a-wanting to have his own way. That comes from being a captain; but, as I tells him, it's only reasonable as he is captain on board his ship I should be captain in my house. I suppose you are going to school?\"  \"No, I am not. My school is just over.\"  \"Going all the way up to London?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That's a mercy,\" the woman said. \"I was afraid you might be only going as far as Canterbury, and then I might have got some big chap up here who would squeeze me as flat as a pancake. Men is so unthoughtful, and seems to think as women can stow themselves away anywheres. I wish you would feel and get your hand in my pocket, young man. I can't do it nohow, and I ain't sure that I have got my keys with me; and that girl Eliza will be getting at the bottles and a-having men in, and then there will be a nice to-do with the lodgers. Can't you find it? It is in the folds somewhere.\"  With much difficulty Ralph found the pocket-hole, and thrusting his hand in was able to reassure his neighbor by feeling among a mass of odds and ends a bunch of keys.  \"That's a comfort,\" the woman said. \"If one's mind isn't at ease one can't enjoy traveling.\"  \"I wish my body was at ease,\" Ralph said. \"Don't you think you could squeeze them a little on the other side and give me an inch or two more room?\"  \"I will try,\" the woman said; \"as you seem a civil sort of boy.\"  Whereupon she gave two or three heaves, which relieved Ralph greatly, but involved her in an altercation with her neighbor on the other side, which lasted till the towers of Canterbury came in sight. Here they changed horses at the Fountain Inn.  \"Look here, my boy,\" the woman said to Ralph. \"If you feel underneath my feet you will find a basket, and at the top there is an empty bottle. There will be just time for you to jump down and get it filled for me. A shilling's worth of brandy, and filled up with water. That girl Eliza flustered me so much with her worritting and questions before I started that I had not time to fill it.\"  Ralph jumped down and procured the desired refreshment, and was just in time to clamber up to his seat again when the coach started. He enjoyed the rapid motion and changing scene much, but he was not sorry when--as evening was coming on--he saw ahead of him a dull mist, which his fellow-passenger told him was the smoke of London.  It was nine in the evening when the coach drove into the courtyard of the Bull Inn. The guard, who had received instructions from Mrs. Conway, at once gave Ralph and his box into the charge of one of the porters awaiting the arrival of the coach, and told him to take the box to the inn from which the coach for Weymouth started in the morning. Cramped by his fourteen hours' journey Ralph had at first some difficulty in following his conductor through the crowded street, but the stiffness soon wore off, and after ten minutes walking he arrived at the inn.  The guard had already paid the porter, having received the money for that purpose from Mrs. Conway; and the latter setting down the box in the passage at once went off. Ralph felt a little forlorn, and wondered what he was to do next. But a minute later the landlady came out from the bar.  \"Do you want a bed?\" she asked. \"The porter should have rung the bell. I am afraid we are full, unless it has been taken beforehand. However, I will see if I can make shift somehow.\"  \"I should be very much obliged if you can,\" Ralph said; \"for I don't know anything about London, and am going on by the Weymouth coach in the morning.\"  \"Oh, might your name be Conway?\"  \"Yes, that is my name,\" Ralph said, surprised.  \"Ah, then there is a bedroom taken for you. A gentleman came three days ago and took it, saying it was for a young gent who is going through to Weymouth. Tom,\" she called, \"take this box up to number 12. Supper is ready for you, sir. I dare say you would like a wash first?\"  \"That I should,\" Ralph replied, following the boots upstairs.  In a few minutes he returned, and a waiter directed him to the coffee-room. In a short time a supper consisting of fish, a steak, and tea was placed before him. Ralph fell to vigorously, and the care that had been bestowed by Mr. Penfold in securing a bedroom and ordering supper for him greatly raised him in the boy's estimation; and he looked forward with warmer anticipations than he had hitherto done to his visit to him. As goon as he had finished he went off to bed, and in a few minutes was sound asleep. At half-past six he was called, and after a hearty breakfast took his seat on the outside of the Weymouth coach.  Sitting beside him were four sailors, belonging, as he soon learned, to a privateer lying at Weymouth. They had had a long trip, and had been some months at sea; and as their ship was to lie for a fortnight at Weymouth while some repairs were being done to her, they had obtained a week's leave and had ran up to London for a spree. Weymouth during the war did a brisk trade, and was a favorite rendezvous of privateers, who preferred it greatly to Portsmouth or Plymouth, where the risk of their men being pressed to make up the quota of some man-of-war just fitted out was very great.  The sailors were rather silent and sulky, at first at the cruise on land being nearly over, but after getting off the coach where it changed horses they recovered their spirits, and amused Ralph greatly with their talk about the various prizes they had taken, and one or two sharp brashes with French privateers. Toward evening they became rather hilarious, but for the last two hours dozed quietly; the man sitting next to Ralph lurching against him heavily in his sleep, and swearing loudly when the boy stuck his elbow into his ribs to relieve himself of the weight. Ralph was not sorry, therefore, when at ten o'clock at night the coach arrived at Weymouth. The landlord and servants came out with lanterns to help the passengers to alight, and the former, as Ralph climbed down the side into the circle of light, asked:  \"Are you Master Conway?\"  \"That's my name,\" Ralph replied.  \"A bed has been taken for you, sir, and a trap will be over here at nine o'clock in the morning to take you to Penfold Hall.\"  Supper was already prepared for such passengers as were going to sleep in the hotel; but Ralph was too sleepy to want to eat, and had made a good meal when the coach stopped at six o'clock for twenty minutes to allow the passengers time for refreshments. At eight o'clock next morning he breakfasted. When he had finished the waiter told him that the trap had arrived a few minutes before, and that the horse had been taken out to have a feed, but would be ready to start by nine. Ralph took a stroll for half an hour by the sea and then returned. The trap was at the door, and his trunk had already been placed in it. The driver, a man of twenty-three or twenty-four, was, as he presently told Ralph, stable-helper at Penfold Hall.  \"I generally drive this trap when it is wanted,\" he said. \"The coachman is pretty old now. He has been in the family well-nigh fifty years. He is all right behind the carriage-horses, he says, but he does not like trusting himself in a pair-wheel trap.\"  \"How far is it?\"  \"A matter of fifteen miles. It would be a lot shorter if you had got off last night at the nearest point the coach goes to; but the master told the coachman that he thought it would be pleasanter for you to come on here than to arrive there tired and sleepy after dark.\"  \"Yes, it will much more pleasant,\" Ralph said. \"The road was very dirty, and I should not like to arrive at a strange house with my clothes all covered with dust, and so sleepy that I could hardly keep my eyes open, especially as I hear that Mr. Penfold's sisters are rather particular.\"  \"Rather isn't the word,\" the driver said; \"they are particular, and no mistake. I don't believe as the master would notice whether the carriage was dirty or clean; but if there is a speck of dirt about they are sure to spot it. Not that they are bad mistresses; but they look about all right, I can tell you, pretty sharp. I don't say that it ain't as well as they do, for the master"]]]
