If a thousand English-speaking Aryans should now be placed on some distant island, how much would their social customs and even amusements differ from ours in a hundred years?  Only so far as changed climate and surrounding's compelled.  I give as an introduction an outline of the golden, silver, brazen and iron ages, as described by the ancient poets and believed in by all antiquity, as it was in the very depths of the darkness of the iron age that our great light appeared in Northern India.  The very denseness of the darkness of the age in which he came makes the clearness of the light more wonderful, and accounts for the joy with which it was received and the rapidity with which it spread.  Not to enter into the niceties of chronological questions, the mission of Buddha may be roughly said to have commenced about five hundred years before the commencement of our era, and with incessant labors and long and repeated journeys to have lasted forty-five years, when at about the age of eighty he died, or, as the Buddhists more truthfully and more beautifully say, entered Nirvana.    HENRY T. NILES.   TOLEDO, January 1, 1894.        *      *      *      *      *  Since this work was in the hands of the printer I have read the recent work of Bishop Copelston, of Columbo, Ceylon, and it was a source of no small gratification to find him in all material points agreeing with the result of my somewhat extensive investigations as given within, for in Ceylon, if anywhere, we would expect accuracy.  Here the great Buddhist development first comes in contact with authentic history during the third century B.C. in the reign of the great Asoka, the discovery of whose rock inscriptions shed such a flood of light on primitive Buddhism, while it still retained enough of its primitive power, as we learn from those inscriptions themselves, to turn that monarch from a course of cruel tyranny, and, as we learn from the history of Ceylon, to induce his son and daughter to abandon royalty and become the first missionaries to that beautiful island.  H.T.N.       INTRODUCTION.    The golden age--when men were brothers all,   The golden rule their law and God their king;   When no fierce beasts did through the forests roam,   Nor poisonous reptiles crawl upon the ground;   When trees bore only wholesome, luscious fruits,   And thornless roses breathed their sweet perfumes;   When sickness, sin and sorrow were unknown,   And tears but spoke of joy too deep for words;   When painless death but led to higher life,   A life that knows no end, in that bright world   Whence angels on the ladder Jacob saw,   Descending, talk with man as friend to friend--   That age of purity and peace had passed,   But left a living memory behind,   Cherished and handed down from sire to son   Through all the scattered peoples of the earth,   A living prophecy of what this world,   This sad and sinful world, might yet become.    The silver age--an age of faith, not sight--   Came next, when reason ruled instead of love;   When men as through a glass but darkly saw   What to their fathers clearly stood revealed   In God's own light of love-illumined truth,   Of which the sun that rising paints the east,   And whose last rays with glory gild the west,   Is but an outbirth.  Then were temples reared,   And priests 'mid clouds of incense sang His praise   Who out of densest darkness called the light,   And from His own unbounded fullness made   The heavens and earth and all that in them is.   Then landmarks were first set, lest men contend   For God's free gifts, that all in peace had shared.   Then laws were made to govern those whose sires   Were laws unto themselves.  Then sickness came,   And grief and pain attended men from birth to death.   But still a silver light lined every cloud,   And hope was given to cheer and comfort men.    The brazen age, brilliant but cold, succeeds.   This was an age of knowledge, art and war,   When the knights-errant of the ancient world,   Adventures seeking, roamed with brazen swords   Which by a wondrous art--then known, now lost--   Were hard as flint, and edged to cut a hair   Or cleave in twain a warrior armor-clad   And armed with shields adorned by Vulcan's art,   Wonder of coming times and theme for bards.[1]   Then science searched through nature's heights and depths.   Heaven's canopy thick set with stars was mapped,   The constellations named, and all the laws searched out   That guide their motions, rolling sphere on sphere.[2]   Then men by reasonings piled up mountain high   Thought to scale heaven, and to dethrone heaven's king,   Whose imitators weak, with quips and quirks   And ridicule would now destroy all sacred things.   This age great Homer and old Hesiod sang,   And gods they made of hero, artist, bard.    At length this twilight of the ages fades,   And starless night now sinks upon the world--   An age of iron, cruel, dark and cold.   On Asia first this outer darkness fell,   Once seat of paradise, primordial peace,   Perennial harmony and perfect love.   A despot's will was then a nation's law;   An idol's car crushed out poor human lives,   And human blood polluted many shrines.   Then human speculation made of God   A shoreless ocean, distant, waveless, vast,   Of truth that sees not and unfeeling love,   Whence souls as drops were taken back to fall,   Absorbed and lost, when, countless ages passed,   They should complete their round as souls of men,   Of beasts, of birds and of all creeping things.   And, even worse, the cruel iron castes,   One caste too holy for another's touch,   Had every human aspiration crushed,   The common brotherhood of man destroyed,   And made all men but Pharisees or slaves.   And worst of all--and what could e'en be worse?--   Woman, bone of man's bone, flesh of his flesh,   The equal partner of a double life,   Who in the world's best days stood by his side   To lighten every care, and heighten every joy,   And in the world's decline still clung to him,   She only true when all beside were false,   When all were cruel she alone still kind,   Light of his hearth and mistress of his home,   Sole spot where peace and joy could still be found--   Woman herself cast down, despised was made   Slave to man's luxury and brutal lust.   Then war was rapine, havoc, needless blood,   Infants impaled before their mothers' eyes,   Women dishonored, mutilated, slain,   Parents but spared to see their children die.   Then peace was but a faithless, hollow truce,   With plots and counter-plots; the dagger's point   And poisoned cup instead of open war;   And life a savage, grim conspiracy   Of mutual murder, treachery and greed.   O dark and cruel age!  O cruel creeds!   O cruel men!  O crushed and bleeding hearts,   That from the very ground in anguish cry:   \"Is there no light--no hope--no help--no God?\"   [1]See Hesiod's description of the shield of Hercules, the St. George of that ancient age of chivalry.

Northward from Ganges' stream and India's plains   An ancient city crowned a lofty hill,   Whose high embattled walls had often rolled   The surging, angry tide of battle back.   Walled on three sides, but on the north a cliff,   At once the city's quarry and its guard,   Cut out in galleries, with vaulted roofs[1]   Upborne upon cyclopean columns vast,   Chiseled with art, their capitals adorned   With lions, elephants, and bulls, life size,   Once dedicate to many monstrous gods   Before the Aryan race as victors came,   Then prisons, granaries and magazines,   Now only known to bandits and wild beasts.   This cliff, extending at each end, bends north,   And rises in two mountain-chains that end   In two vast snow-capped Himalayan peaks,   Between which runs a glittering glacial stream,   A mighty moving mass of crystal ice,   Crushing the rocks in its resistless course;   From which bursts forth a river that had made   Of all this valley one great highland lake,   Which on one side had burst its bounds and cut   In myriad years a channel through the rock,   So narrow that a goat might almost leap   From cliff to cliff--these cliffs so smooth and steep   The eagles scarce could build upon their sides;   This yawning chasm so deep one scarce could hear   The angry waters roaring far below.    This stream, guided by art, now fed a lake   Above the city and behind this cliff,   Which, guided thence in channels through the rock,   Fed many fountains, sending crystal streams   Through every street and down the terraced hill,   And through the plain in little silver streams,   Spreading the richest verdure far and wide.[2]   Here was the seat of King Suddhodana,   His royal park, walled by eternal hills,   Where trees and shrubs and flowers all native grew;   For in its bounds all the four seasons met,   From ever-laughing, ever-blooming spring   To savage winter with eternal snows.   Here stately palms, the banyan's many trunks,   Darkening whole acres with its grateful shade,   And bamboo groves, with graceful waving plumes,   The champak, with its fragrant golden flowers,   Asokas, one bright blaze of brilliant bloom,   The mohra, yielding food and oil and wine,   The sacred sandal and the spreading oak,   The mountain-loving fir and spruce and pine,   And giant cedars, grandest of them all,   Planted in ages past, and thinned and pruned   With that high art that hides all trace of art,[3]   Were placed to please the eye and show their form   In groves, in clumps, in jungles and alone.    Here all a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],["title","The Dawn and the Day (#2)"],["body","seemed; there open groves,   With vine-clad trees, vines hanging from each limb,   A pendant chain of bloom, with shaded drives   And walks, with rustic seats, cool grots and dells,   With fountains playing and with babbling brooks,   And stately swans sailing on little lakes,   While peacocks, rainbow-tinted shrikes, pheasants,   Glittering like precious stones, parrots, and birds   Of all rich plumage, fly from tree to tree,   The whole scene vocal with sweet varied song;   And here a widespread lawn bedecked with flowers,   With clumps of brilliant roses grown to trees,   And fields with dahlias spread,[4] not stiff and prim   Like the starched ruffle of an ancient dame,   But growing in luxuriance rich and wild,   The colors of the evening and the rainbow joined,   White, scarlet, yellow, crimson, deep maroon,   Blending all colors in one dazzling blaze;   There orchards bend beneath their luscious loads;   Here vineyards climb the hills thick set with grapes;   There rolling pastures spread, where royal mares,   High bred, and colts too young for bit or spur,   Now quiet feed, then, as at trumpet's call,   With lion bounds, tails floating, neck outstretched,[5]   Nostrils distended, fleet as the flying wind   They skim the plain, and sweep in circles wide--   Nature's Olympic, copied, ne'er excelled.   Here, deer with dappled fawn bound o'er the grass,[6]   And sacred herds, and sheep with skipping lambs;   There, great white elephants in quiet nooks;   While high on cliffs framed in with living green   Goats climb and seem to hang and feed in air--   Sweet spot, with all to please and nothing to offend.    Here on a hill the royal palace stood,   A gem of art; and near, another hill,   Its top crowned by an aged banyan tree,   Its sides clad in strange jyotismati grass,[7]   By day a sober brown, but in the night   Glowing as if the hill were all aflame--   Twin wonders to the dwellers in the plain,   Their guides and landmarks day and night,   This glittering palace and this glowing hill.   Within, above the palace rose a tower,   Which memory knew but as the ancient tower,   Foursquare and high, an altar and a shrine   On its broad top, where burned perpetual fire,   Emblem of boundless and eternal love   And truth that knows no night, no cloud, no change,   Long since gone out, with that most ancient faith   In one great Father, source of life and light.[8]   Still round this ancient tower, strange hopes and fears,   And memories handed down from sire to son,   Were clustered thick.  An army, old men say,   Once camped against the city, when strange lights   Burst from this tower, blinding their dazzled eyes.   They fled amazed, nor dared to look behind.   The people bloody war and cruel bondage saw   On every side, and they at peace and free,   And thought a power to save dwelt in that tower.   And now strange prophecies and sayings old   Were everywhere rehearsed, that from this hill   Should come a king or savior of the world.   Even the poor dwellers in the distant plain   Looked up; they too had heard that hence should come   One quick to hear the poor and strong to save.   And who shall dare to chide their simple faith?   This humble reverence for the great unknown   Brings men near God, and opens unseen worlds,   Whence comes all life, and where all power doth dwell.    Morning and evening on this tower the king,   Before the rising and the setting sun,   Blindly, but in his father's faith, bowed down.   Then he would rise and on his kingdom gaze.   East, west, hills beyond hills stretched far away,   Wooded, terraced, or bleak and bald and bare,   Till in dim distance all were leveled lost.   One rich and varied carpet spread far south,   Of fields, of groves, of busy cities wrought,   With mighty rivers seeming silver threads;   And to the north the Himalayan chain,   Peak beyond peak, a wall of crest and crag,   Ice bound, snow capped, backed by intensest blue,   Untrod, immense, that, like a crystal wall.   In myriad varied tints the glorious light   Of rising and of setting sun reflects;   His noble city lying at his feet,   And his broad park, tinged by the sun's slant rays   A thousand softly rich and varied shades.    Still on this scene of grandeur, plenty, peace   And ever-varying beauty, he would gaze   With sadness.  He had heard these prophecies,   And felt the unrest in that great world within,   Hid from our blinded eyes, yet ever near,   The very soul and life of this dead world,   Which seers and prophets open-eyed have seen,   On which the dying often raptured gaze,   And where they live when they are mourned as dead.   This world was now astir, foretelling day.   \"A king shall come, they say, to rule the world,   If he will rule; but whence this mighty king?   My years decline apace, and yet no son   Of mine to rule or light my funeral pile.\"    One night Queen Maya, sleeping by her lord,   Dreamed a strange dream; she dreamed she saw a star   Gliding from heaven and resting over her;   She dreamed she heard strange music, soft and sweet,   So distant \"joy and peace\" was all she heard.   In joy and peace she wakes, and waits to know   What this strange dream might mean, and whence it came.    Drums, shells and trumpets sound for joy, not war;   The streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes,   And myriad lamps shine from each house and tree,   And myriad flags flutter in every breeze,   And children crowned with flowers dance in the streets,   And all keep universal holiday   With shows and games, and laugh and dance and song,   For to the gentle queen a son is born,   To King Suddhodana the good an heir.    But scarcely had these myriad lamps gone out,   The sounds of revelry had scarcely died,   When coming from the palace in hot haste,   One cried, \"Maya, the gentle queen, is dead.\"   Then mirth was changed to sadness, joy to grief,   For all had learned to love the gentle queen--   But at Siddartha's birth this was foretold.    Among the strangers bringing gifts from far,   There came an ancient sage--whence, no one knew--   Age-bowed, head like the snow, eyes filmed and white,   So deaf the thunder scarcely startled him,   Who met them, as they said, three journeys back,   And all his talk was of a new-born king,   Just born, to rule the world if he would rule.   He was so gentle, seemed so wondrous wise,   They followed him, he following, he said,   A light they could not see; and when encamped,   Morn, noon and night devoutly would he pray,   And then would talk for hours, as friend to friend,   With questionings about this new-born king,   Gazing intently at the tent's blank wall,   With nods and smiles, as if he saw and heard,   While they sit lost in wonder, as one sits   Who never saw a telephone, but hears   Unanswered questions, laughter at unheard jests,   And sees one bid a little box good-by.   And when they came before the king, they saw,   Laughing and cooing on its mother's knee,   Picture of innocence, a sweet young child;   He saw a mighty prophet, and bowed down   Eight times in reverence to the very ground,   And rising said, \"Thrice happy house, all hail!   This child would rule the world, if he would rule,   But he, too good to rule, is born to save;   But Maya's work is done, the devas wait.\"   But when they sought for him, the sage was gone,   Whence come or whither gone none ever knew.   Then gentle Maya understood her dream.   The music nearer, clearer sounds; she sleeps.   But when the funeral pile was raised for her,   Of aloe, sandal, and all fragrant woods,   And decked with flowers and rich with rare perfumes,   And when the queen was gently laid thereon,   As in sweet sleep, and the pile set aflame,   The king cried out in anguish; when the sage   Again appeared, and gently said, \"Weep not!   Seek not, O king, the living with the dead!   'Tis but her cast-off garment, not herself,   That now dissolves in air.  Thy loved one lives,   Become thy deva,[9] who was erst thy queen.\"   This said, he vanished, and was no more seen.    Now other hands take up that mother's task.   Another breast nurses that sweet young child   With growing love; for who can nurse a child,   Feel its warm breath, and little dimpled hands,   Kiss its soft lips, look in its laughing eyes,   Hear its low-cooing love-notes soft and sweet,   And not feel something of that miracle,   A mother's love--so old yet ever new,   Stronger than death, bravest among the brave,   Gentle as brave, watchful both night and day,   That never changes, never tires nor sleeps.   Whence comes this wondrous and undying love?   Whence can it come, unless it comes from heaven,   Whose life is love--eternal, perfect love!    From babe to boy, from boy to youth he grew,   But more in grace and knowledge than in years.   At play his joyous laugh rang loud and clear,   His foot was fleetest in all boyish games,   And strong his arm, and steady nerve and eye,   To whirl the quoit and send the arrow home;   Yet seeming oft to strive, he'd check his speed   And miss his mark to let a comrade win.   In fullness of young life he climbed the cliffs   Where human foot had never trod before.   He led the chase, but when soft-eyed gazelles   Or bounding deer, or any harmless thing,   Came in the range of his unerring dart,   He let them pass; for why, thought he, should men   In wantonness make war on innocence?    One day the Prince Siddartha saw the grooms   Gathered about a stallion, snowy white,   Descended from that great Nisaean stock   His fathers brought from Iran's distant plain,   Named Kantaka.  Some held him fast with chains   Till one could mount.  He, like a lion snared,   Frantic with rage and fear, did fiercely bound.   They cut his tender mouth with bloody bit,   Beating his foaming sides until the Prince,   Sterner than was his wont, bade them desist,   While he spoke soothingly, patted his head   And stroked his neck, and dropped those galling chains,   When Kantaka's fierce"]]]
