Then, for the first time, I understood what Christian faith and revelation were.\"  \"It is wonderful,\" said I, \"that the theologians have not broken down all religion, and they will succeed yet, if the believers do not seriously confront them and say: 'Thus far but no farther.'  Every church must have its servants, but there has been as yet no religion which the Priests, the Brahmins, the Schamins, the Bonzes, the Lamas, the Pharisees, or the Scribes have not corrupted and perverted.  They wrangle and dispute in a language unintelligible to nine-tenths of their congregations, and instead of permitting themselves to be inspired by the apostles, and of inspiring others with their inspiration, they construct long arguments to show that the Gospels must be true, because they were written by inspired men.  But this is only a makeshift for their own unbelief.  How can they know that these men were inspired in a wonderful manner, without ascribing to themselves a still more wonderful inspiration?  Therefore they extend the gift of inspiration to the fathers of the church; they attribute to them those very things which the majority have incorporated in the canons of the councils; and there again, when the question arises how we know that of fifty bishops twenty-six were inspired and twenty-four were not, they finally take the last desperate step, and say that infallibility and inspiration are inherent in the heads of the church down to the present day, through the laying on of hands, so that infallibility, majority and inspiration make all our convictions, all resignation, all devout intuitions, superfluous.  And yet, notwithstanding all these connecting links, the first question returns in all its simplicity: How can B know that A is inspired, if B is not equally, or even more, inspired than A?  For it is of more consequence to know that A was inspired than for one's self to be inspired.\"  \"I have never comprehended this so clearly myself,\" said she.  \"But I have often felt how difficult it must be to know whether one loves who shows not a sign of love that could not be imitated.  And, again, I have thought that no one could know it unless he knew love himself, and that he could only believe in the love of another so far as he believed in his own love.  As with the gift of love so is it with the gift of the Holy Spirit.  They upon whom it descended heard a rushing from heaven as of a mighty wind, and there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire.  But the rest were either amazed and perplexed, or they made sport of them and said: 'They are full of sweet wine.'  \"Still, as I said to you, it is the 'German Theology' to which I am indebted for learning to believe in my belief, and what will seem a weakness to many, strengthened me the most; namely, that the old master never stops to demonstrate his propositions rigidly, but scatters them like a sower, in the hope that some grains will fall upon good soil and bear fruit a thousand fold.  So our Divine Master never attempted to prove his doctrines, for the perfect conviction of truth disdains the form of a demonstration.\"  \"Yes,\" I interrupted her, for I could not help thinking of the wonderful chain of proof in Spinoza's 'Ethics,' the straining after demonstration by Spinoza gives me the impression that this acute thinker could not have believed in his own doctrines with his whole heart, and that he therefore felt the necessity of fastening every mesh of his net with the utmost care.  \"Still,\" I continued, \"I must acknowledge I do not share this great admiration for the 'German Theology,' although I owe the book many a doubt.  To me there is a lack of the human and the poetical in it, and of warm feeling and reverence for reality altogether.  The entire mysticism of the fourteenth century is wholesome as a preparative, but it first reaches solution in the divinely holy and divinely courageous return to real life, as was exemplified by Luther.  Man must at some time in his life recognize his nothingness.  He must feel that he is nothing of himself, that his existence, his beginning, his everlasting life are rooted in the superearthly and incomprehensible.  That is the returning to God which in reality is never concluded on earth but yet leaves behind in the soul a divine home sickness, which never again ceases.  But man cannot ignore the creation as the Mystics would.  Although created out of nothing, that is, through and out of God, he cannot of his own power resolve himself back into this nothingness.  The self-annihilation of which Tauler so often speaks is scarcely better than the sinking away of the human soul in Nirvana, as the Buddhists have it.  Thus Tauler says: 'That if he by greater reverence and love could reach the highest existence in non-existence, he would willingly sink from his height into the deepest abyss.'  But this annihilation of the creature was not the purpose of the Creator since he made it.  'God is transformed in man,' says Augustine, 'not man in God.'  Thus mysticism should be only a fire-trial which steels the soul but does not evaporate it like boiling water in a kettle.  He who has recognized the nothingness of self ought to recognize this self as a reflection of the actual divine. The 'German Theology' says:  [\"Was nu us geflossen ist, das ist nicht war wesen, und hat kein wesen anders dan in dem volkomen, sunder es ist ein zufal oder ein glast und ein schin, der nicht wesen ist oder nicht wesen hat anders, dan in dem sewer, da der glast us flusset, als in der sunnen oder in einem liechte.\"]  \"What has flown out is not real substance and has no other reality except in the perfect; but it is an incident or a glare or a shimmer, which is no substance, and has no other reality, except in the fire from which a glare proceeds, as in the sun or a light.\"  \"What is emitted from the divine, though it be only like the reflection from the fire, still has the divine reality in itself, and one might almost ask what were the fire without glow, the sun without light, or the Creator without the creature?  These are questions of which it is said very truthfully:  [\"Welch mensche und welche creatur begert zu erfaren und zu wissen den heimlichen rat und willen gottes, der begert nicht anders denne als Adam tet und der boese geist.\"]  \"What man or creature desires to learn and to know the secret counsel and will of God--desires nothing else but what Adam did and the evil spirit.  \"For this reason, it should be enough for us to feel and to appear that we are a reflection of the divine until we are divine.  No one should place under a bushel or extinguish the divine light which illuminates us, but let it beam out, that it may brighten and warm all about it. Then one feels a living fire in his veins, and a higher consecration for the struggle of life.  The most trivial duties remind us of God. The earthly becomes divine, the temporal eternal, and our entire life a life in God.  God is not eternal repose.  He is everlasting life, which Angelus Silesius forgets when he says: 'God is without will.'    \"'We pray: 'Thy will my Lord and God be done,'   And lo, He has no will!  He is an eternal silence.'\"  She listened to me quietly, and, after a moment's reflection, said: \"Health and strength belong to your faith; but there are life-weary souls, who long for rest and sleep, and feel so lonely that when they fall asleep in God, they miss the world as little as the world misses them.  It is a foretaste of divine rest to them when they can wrap themselves in the divine; and this they can do, since no tie binds them fast to earth, and no wish troubles their hearts except the wish for rest.    \"'Rest is the highest good, and were God not rest,   Then would I avert my gaze even from Him.'  \"You do the German theologian an injustice.  It is true he teaches the nothingness of the external life, but he does not wish to see it annihilated.  Read me the twenty-eighth chapter.\"  I took the book and read, while she closed her eyes and listened:  [\"Und wa die voreinunge geschicht in der wahrheit und wesentlich wirt, da stet vorbass der inner mensche in der einung unbeweglich und got lest den ussern menschen her und dar bewegt werden von diesem zu dem. Das muss und sol sin und geschehen, dass der usser mensche spricht und es ouch in der warheit also ist, 'ich wil weder sin noch nit sin, weder leben oder sterben, wissen oder nicht wissen, tun oder lassen, und alles das disem glich ist, sunder alles, das da muss und sol sin und geschehen, da bin ich bereit und gehorsam zu, es si in lidender wise oder in tuender wise.'  Und alsoe hat der usser mensch kein warumbe oder gesuch, sunder alleine dem ewigen willen genuk zu sin.  Wan das wirt bekannt in der warheit, das der inner mensche sten sol unbeweglich und der usser mensch muss und sol bewegt werden, und hat der inner mensch in siner beweglikeit ein warumb, das ist anders nichts dann ein muss- und sol-sin, geordnet von dem ewigen willen.  Und wa got selber der mensch were oder ist, da ist es also.  Das merket man wol in Kristo.  Auch wa das in goetlichem und us goetlichem liechte ist, da ist nit geistliche hochfart noch unachtsame friheit oder frie gemute, sunder ein gruntlose demutigkeit und ein nider geschlagen und ein gesunken betrubet gemut, und alle ordenligkeit und redeligkeit, glichheit und warheit, fride und genugsamkeit, und alles das, das allen tugenden zu gehoert, das muss da sin.  Wa es anders ist, da ist im nit recht, als vor gesprochen ist.  Wan recht als dises oder das zu diser einung nit gehelfen oder gedienen kan, also is ouch nichtes, das es geirren oder gehindern mag, denn alleine der mensch mit sinem eigen willen, der tut im disen grossen schaden.  Das sol man wissen.\"]  \"And when the union takes place in truth and becomes real, then the inner man stands henceforth immovable in the union, and God permits the outer man to be driven hither and thither from this to that.  It must and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],["title","Memories: A Story of German Love (#6)"],["body","be and happen, that the outer man says--and is so also in truth--'I will neither be nor not be, neither live nor die, neither know nor not know, neither do nor leave undone--and everything which is similar to this, but I am ready and obedient to do everything, which must and shall be done, be it passively or actively.'  And thus has the outer man no question or desire, but to, satisfy only the Eternal Will. When this will be known in truth, that the inner man shall stand, immovable, and that the outer man shall and must be moved,--the inner man has a why and wherefore of his moving, which is nothing but an 'it must and shall be' ordered by the Eternal Will.  And if God himself were or is the man, it would be so.  This is well seen in Christ.  And what in the Divine Light is and from the Divine Light, has neither spiritual pride nor careless license nor an independent spirit--but a great humility, and a broken and contrite heart,--and all propriety and honesty, justice and truth, peace and happiness,--all that belongs to all virtues, it must have.  When it is otherwise, then he is not happy, as has been said.  When this does not help to this union, then there is nothing which may hinder it but man alone with his own will, which does him such great harm.  That, one ought to know.\"  \"This is sufficient,\" said she; \"I believe we understand each other now.  In another place, our unknown friend says still more unmistakably that no man is passive before death, and that the glorified man is like the hand of God, which does nothing of itself except as God wills; or, like a house in which God dwells.  A God-possessed man feels this perfectly, but does not speak of it.  He treasures his life in God like a love secret.  It often seems to me like that silver poplar before my window.  It is perfectly still at evening, and not a leaf trembles or stirs.  When the morning breeze rustles and tosses every leaf, the trunk with its branches stands still and immovable, and when autumn conies, though every leaf which once rustled falls to the ground and withers, the trunk waits for a new spring.\"  She had lived so deep a life in her world that I did not wish to disturb it.  I had but just released myself with difficulty from the magic circle of these thoughts, and scarcely knew whether she had not chosen the better part which could not be taken away from her; while we have so much trouble and care.  Thus every evening brought its new conversation, and with each evening, some new phase of her fathomless mind disclosed itself.  She kept no secret from me.  Her talk was only thinking and feeling aloud, and what she said must have dwelt with her many long years, for she poured out her thoughts as freely as a child that picks its lap full of flowers and then sprinkles them upon the grass.  I could not disclose my soul to her as freely as she did to me, and this oppressed and pained me. Yet how few can, with those continual deceptions imposed upon us by society, called manners, politeness, consideration, prudence, and worldly wisdom, which make our entire life a masquerade!  How few, even when they would, can regain the complete truth of their existence! Love itself dares not speak its own language and maintain its own silence, but must learn the set phrases of the poet and idealize, sigh and flirt instead of freely greeting, beholding and surrendering itself, I would most gladly have confessed and said to her: \"You know me not,\" but I found that the words were not wholly true.  Before I left, I gave her a volume of Arnold's poems, which I had had a short time, and begged her to read the one called \"The Buried Life.\"  It was my confession, and then I kneeled at her couch and said \"Good Night.\" \"Good Night,\" said she, and laid her hand upon my head, and again her touch thrilled through, every limb and the dreams of childhood uprose in my soul.  I could not go, but gazed into her deep unfathomable eyes until the peace of her soul completely overshadowed mine.  Then I arose and went home in silence--and in the night I dreamed of the silver poplar around which the wind roared--but not a leaf stirred on its branches.     THE BURIED LIFE.    Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet   Behold, with tears my eyes are wet;   I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.    Yes, yes, we know that we can jest;   We know, we know that we can smile;   But there's a something in this breast   To which thy light words bring no rest,   And thy gay smiles no anodyne.    Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,   And turn those limpid eyes on mine,   And, let me read there, love, thy inmost soul.    Alas, is even love too weak   To unlock the heart, and let it speak?   Are even lovers powerless to reveal   To one another what indeed they feel?   I knew the mass of men concealed   Their thoughts, for fear that if revealed   They would by other men be met   With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;   I knew they lived and moved,   Tricked in disguises, alien to the rest   Of men and alien to themselves--and yet,   The same heart beats in every human breast.    But we, my love--does a like spell benumb   Our hearts--our voices?--must we too be dumb?    Ah! well for us, if even we,   Even for a moment, can yet free   Our hearts and have our lips unchained;   For that which seals them hath been deep ordained.   Fate which foresaw   How frivolous a baby man would be,   By what distractions he would be possessed,   How he would pour himself in every strife,   And well-nigh change his own identity,   That it might keep from his capricious play   His genuine self, and force him to obey,   Even in his own despite, his being's law,   Bade through the deep recesses of our breast   The unregarded River of our Life,   Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;   And that we should not see   The buried stream, and seem to be   Eddying about in blind uncertainty,   Though driving on with it eternally.    But often, in the world's most crowded streets,   But often in the din of strife,   There rises an unspeakable desire   After the knowledge of our buried life;    A thirst to spend our fire and restless force   In tracking out our true original course;   A longing to inquire   Into the mystery of this heart that beats   So wild, so deep, in us; to know   Whence our thoughts come, and where they go.   And many a man in his own breast then delves,   But deep enough, alas, none ever mines;   And we have been on many thousand lines,   And we have shown on each, talent and power,   But hardly have we, for one little hour,   Been on our own line, have we been ourselves;   Hardly had skill to utter one of all   The nameless feelings that course through our breast,   But they course on forever unexpressed.   And long we try in vain to speak and act   Our hidden self, and what we say and do   Is eloquent, is well--but 'tis not true.    And then we will no more be racked   With inward striving, and demand   Of all the thousand nothings of the hour   Their stupefying power;   Ah! yes, and they benumb us at our call;   Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,   From the soul's subterranean depth upborne,   As from an infinitely distant land,   Come airs and floating echoes, and convey   A melancholy into all our day.    Only--but this is rare--   When a beloved hand is laid in ours,   When, jaded with the rush and glare   Of the interminable hours,   Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,   When our world-deafened ear   Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed,--   A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,   And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again:   The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,   And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know;    A man becomes aware of his life's flow,   And, hears its winding murmur, and he sees   The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.    And there arrives a lull in the hot race   Wherein he doth forever chase   That flying and elusive shadow, Rest;   An air of coolness plays upon his face,   And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.    And then he thinks he knows   The Hills where his life rose,   And the Sea where it goes. . . . . . .     SIXTH MEMORY.  Early the next morning, there was a knock at the door, and my old doctor, the Hofrath, entered.  He was the friend, the body-and-soul-guardian of our entire little village.  He had seen two generations grow up. Children whom he had brought into the world had in turn become fathers and mothers, and he treated them as his children.  He himself was unmarried, and even in his old age was strong and handsome to look upon. I never knew him otherwise than as he stood before me at that time; his clear blue eyes gleaming under the bushy brows, his flowing white hair still full of youthful strength, curling and vigorous.  I can never forget, also, his shoes, with their silver buckles, his white stockings, his brown coat, which always looked new, and yet seemed to be old, and his cane, which was the same I had seen standing by my bedside in childhood, when he felt my pulse and prescribed my medicines.  I had often been sick, but it was always faith in this man which made me well again.  I never had the slightest doubt of his ability to cure me, and when my mother said she must send for the Hofrath that I might get well again, it was as if she had said she must send for the tailor to mend my torn trousers.  I had only to take the medicine, and I felt that I must be well again.  \"How are you, my child?\" said he, as he entered the room.  \"You are not looking perfectly well.  You must not study too much.  But I have little time to-day to talk, and only came to tell you, you must not go to see the Countess Marie again.  I have been with her all night, and it is your fault.  So be careful, if her life is dear to you, that you do not go again.  She must leave here as soon as possible, and be taken into the country.  It would be best for you also to travel for a long time.  So good "]]]
