When she asked his name and where he lived, he replied in the coldly civil manner with which he had heard his mother repress the good-natured advances of her wandering countrymen. When again the seat was free, he fell to thinking of the unknown home, Grey Pine, which he had heard his mother talk of to English friends as \"our ancestral home,\" and of the great forests, the mines and the iron-works. Her son would, of course, inherit it, as Captain Penhallow had no child. \"Really a great estate, my dear,\" his mother had said. It loomed large in his young imagination. Who would meet him? Probably a carriage with the liveried driver and the groom immaculate in white-topped boots, a fur cover on his arm. It would, of course, be Captain Penhallow who would make him welcome. Then the cold, which is hostile to imagination, made him shiver as he drew his thin cloak about him and watched the snow squadrons wind-driven and the big flakes blurring his view as they melted on the panes. By and by, two giggling young women near by made comments on his looks and dress. Fragments of their talk he overheard. It was not quite pleasant. \"Law! ain't he got curly hair, and ain't he just like a girl doll,\" and so on in the lawless freedom of democratic feminine speech. The flat Morocco cap and large visor of the French schoolboy and the dark blue cloak with the silver clasp were subjects of comment. One of them offered peanuts or sugar-plums, which he declined with \"Much obliged, but I never take them.\" Now and then he consulted his watch or felt in his pocket to be certain that his baggage-check was secure, or looked to see if the little bag of toilet articles at his feet was safe. The kindly attentions of those who noticed his evident discomfort were neither mannerless nor, as he thought, impertinent. A woman said to him that he seemed cold, wouldn't he put around him a shawl she laid on his knees. He declined it civilly with thanks. In fact, he was thinly and quite too lightly clad, and he not only felt the cold, but was unhappy and utterly unprepared by any previous experience for the mode of travel, the crowded car and the rough kindness of the people, who liking his curly hair and refined young childlike face would have been of service if he had accepted their advances with any pleasure. Presently, after four in the afternoon, the brakeman called \"All out for Westways Crossing.\"  John seized his bag and was at the exit-door before the train came to a stand. The conductor bade him be careful, as the steps were slippery. As the engine snorted and the train moved away, the conductor cried out, \"Forgot your cane, sonny,\" and threw the light gold-mounted bamboo from the car. He had a new sense of loneliness as he stood on the roofless platform, half a foot deep in gathering snow, which driven by a pitiless gale from the north blew his cloak about as he looked to see that his trunk had been delivered. A man shifted a switch and coming back said, \"Gi'me your check.\" John decided that this was not safe, and to the man's amusement said that he would wait until the carriage of Captain Penhallow arrived. The man went away. John remained angrily expectant looking up the road. Presently he heard the gay jingle of bells and around a turn of the road came a one-horse sleigh. It stopped beside him. He first saw only the odd face of the driver in a fur cap and earlets. Then, tossing off the bear skins, bounded on to the platform a young girl and shook herself snow-free as she threw back a wild mane of dark red hair.  \"Halloa! John Penhallow,\" she cried, \"I'm Leila Grey. I'm sent for you. I'm late too. Uncle James has gone to the mills and Aunt Ann is busy. Been here long?\"  \"Not very,\" said John, his teeth chattering with cold.  \"Gracious! you'll freeze. Sorry I was late.\" She saw at a glance the low shoes, the blue cloak, the kid gloves, the boy's look of suffering, and at once took possession of him.  \"Get into the sleigh. Oh! leave your check on the trunk or give it to me.\" She was off and away to the trunk as he climbed in, helpless. She undid the counter check, ran across to the guard's house, was back in a moment and tumbled in beside him.  \"But, is it safe? My trunk, I mean,\" said John.  \"Safe. No one will steal it. Pat will come for it. There he is now. Tuck in the rugs. Put this shawl around you and over your head.\" She pinned it with ready fingers.  \"Now, you'll be real comfy.\" The chilled boy puzzled and amused her.  As he became warm, John felt better in the hands of this easy despot, but was somewhat indignant. \"To send a chit of a girl for him--John Penhallow!\"  \"Now,\" she cried to the driver, \"be careful. Why did they send _you_?\"  Billy, a middle-aged man, short-legged and long of body, turned a big-featured head as he replied in an odd boyish voice, \"The man was busy giving a ball in the stable.\"  \"A ball\"--said John--\"in the stable?\"  \"Oh! that is funny,\" said the girl. \"A ball's a big pill for Lucy, my mare. She's sick.\"  \"Oh! I see.\" And they were off and away through the wind-driven snow.  The girl, instinctively aware of the shyness and discomfort of her companion, set herself to put him at ease. The lessening snow still fell, but now a brilliant sun lighted the white radiance of field and forest. He was warmer, and the disconnected chat of childhood began.  \"The snow is early. Don't you love it?\" said the small maid bent on making herself agreeable.  \"No, I do not.\"  \"But, oh!--see--the sun is out. Now you will like it. I suppose you don't know how to walk in snow-shoes, or it would be lovely to go right home across country.\"  \"I never used them. Once I read about them in a book.\"  \"Oh! you'll learn. I'll teach you.\"  John, used to being considered and flattered, as he became more comfortable began to resent the way in which the girl proposed to instruct him. He was silent for a time.  \"Tuck in that robe,\" she said. \"How old are you?\"  \"This last September, fifteen. How old are you?\"  \"Guess.\"  \"About ten, I think.\" Now this was malicious.  \"Ten, indeed! I'm thirteen and ten months and--and three days,\" she returned, with the accuracy of childhood about age. \"Were you at school in Europe?\"  \"Yes, in France and Hungary.\"  \"That's queer. In Hungary and France--Oh! then you can speak French.\"  \"Of course,\" he replied. \"Can't you?\"  \"A little, but Aunt Ann says I have a good accent when I read to her--we often do.\"  \"You should say 'without accent,'\" he felt better after this assertion of superior knowledge. She thought his manners bad, but, though more amused than annoyed, felt herself snubbed and was silent for a time. He was quick to perceive that he had better have held his critical tongue, and said pleasantly, \"But really it don't matter--only I was told that in France.\"  She was as quick to reply, \"You shouldn't say 'don't matter,' I say that sometimes, and then Uncle James comes down on me.\"  \"Why? I am really at a loss--\"  \"Oh! you must say 'doesn't'--not 'don't.'\" She shook her great mass of hair and cried merrily, \"I guess we are about even now, John Penhallow.\"  Then they laughed gaily, as the boy said, \"I wasn't very--very courteous.\"  \"Now that's pretty, John. Good gracious, Billy!\" she cried, punching the broad back of the driver. \"Are you asleep? You are all over the road.\"  \"Oh! I was thinkin' how Pole, the butcher, sold the Squire a horse that's spavined--got it sent back--funny, wasn't it?\"  \"Look out,\" said Leila, \"you will upset us.\"  John looked the uneasiness he felt, as he said, \"Do you think it is safe?\"  \"No, I don't. Drive on, Billy, but do be careful.\"  They came to the little village of Westways. At intervals Billy communicated bits of village gossip. \"Susan McKnight, she's going to marry Finney--\"  \"Bother Susan,\" cried Leila. \"Be careful.\"  John alarmed held on to his seat as the sleigh rocked about, while Billy whipped up the mare.  \"This is Westways, our village. It is just a row of houses. Uncle James won't sell land on our side. Look out, Billy! Our rector lives in that small house by the church. His name is Mark Rivers. You'll like him. That's Mr. Grace, the Baptist preacher.\" She bade him good-day. \"Stop, Billy!\"  He pulled up at the sidewalk. \"Good afternoon, Mrs. Crocker,\" she said, as the postmistress came out to the sleigh. \"Please mail this. Any letters for us?\"  \"No, Leila.\" She glanced at the curly locks above the thin face and the wrapped up form in the shawl. \"Got a nice little girl with you, Leila.\"  John indignant said nothing. \"This is a boy--my cousin, John Penhallow,\" returned Leila.  \"Law! is that so?\"  \"Get on,\" cried Leila. \"Stop at Josiah's.\"  Here a tall, strongly built, very black negro came out. \"Fine frosty day, missy.\"  \"Come up to the house to-night. Uncle Jim wants you.\"  \"I'll come--sure.\"  \"Now, get along, Billy.\"  The black was strange to the boy. He thought the lower orders here disrespectful.  \"Josiah's our barber,\" said Leila. \"He saved me once from a dreadful accident. You'll like him.\"  \"Will I?\" thought John, but merely remarked, \"They all seem rather intimate.\"  \"Why not?\" said the young Republican. \"Ah! here's the gate. I'll get out and open it. It's the best gate to swing on in the whole place.\"  As she tossed the furs aside, John gasped, \"To swing on--\"  \"Oh, yes. Aunt Ann says I am too old to swing on gates, but I do. It shuts with a bang. I'll show you some day.\"  \"What is swinging on a gate?\" said John, as she jumped out and stood in the snow laughing. Surely this was an amazing kind of boy. \"Why, did you never hear the rhyme about it?\"  \"No,\" said John, \"I never did.\"  \"Well, you just get on the gate when it's wide open and give a push, and you sing--    \"If I was the President of these United States,   I'd suck molasses candy and swing upon the gates.  \"There! Then it shuts--bang!\" With this bit of child folklore she scampered away through the snow and stood holding the gate open while Billy drove through. She reflected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14153"],["title","Westways: A Village Chronicle (#2)"],["body","that it must have been three years since she had swung on a gate.  John feeling warm and for the first time looking about him with interest began to notice the grandeur of the rigid snow-laden pines of an untouched forest which stood in what was now brilliant sunshine.  As Leila got into the sleigh, she said, \"Now, Billy, go slowly when you make the short turn at the house. If you upset us, I--I'll kill you.\"  \"Yes, miss. Guess I'll drive all right.\" But the ways of drivers are everywhere the same, and to come to the end of a drive swiftly with crack of whip was an unresisted temptation.  \"_Sang de Dieu!_\" cried John, \"we will be upset.\"  \"We are,\" shouted Leila. The horse was down, the sleigh on its side, and the cousins disappeared in a huge drift piled high when the road was cleared.     CHAPTER II   John was the first to return to the outer world. He stood still, seeing the horse on its legs, Billy unharnessing, Leila for an instant lost to sight. The boy was scared. In his ordered life it was an unequalled experience. Then he saw a merry face above the drift and lying around it a wide-spread glory of red hair on the white snow. In after years he would recall the beauty of the laughing young face in its setting of dark gold and sunlit silver snow.  \"Oh, my!\" she cried. \"That Billy! Don't stand there, John; pull me out, I'm stuck.\"  He gave her a hand and she bounded forth out of the drift, shaking off the dry snow as a wet dog shakes off water. \"What's the matter, John?\"  He was trying to empty neck, pocket and shoes of snow, and was past the limits of what small endurance he had been taught. \"I shall catch my death of cold. It's down my back--it's everywhere, and I--shall get--laryngitis.\"  The brave blue eyes of the girl stared at his dejected figure. She was at heart a gentle, little woman-child, endowed by nature with so much of tom-boy barbarism as was good for her. Just now a feeling of contemptuous surprise overcame her kindliness and her aunt's training. \"There's your bag on the snow, and Billy will find your cap. What does a boy want with a bag? A boy--and afraid of snow!\" she cried. \"Help him with that harness.\"  He made no reply, but looked about for his lost cane. Then the young despot turned upon the driver. \"Wait till Uncle James hears; he'll come down on you.\"  \"My lands!\" said Billy, unbuckling a trace, \"I'll just say, I'm sorry; and the Squire he'll say, don't let it happen again; and I'll say, yes, sir.\"  \"Yes, until Aunt Ann hears,\" said Leila, and turned to John. His attitude of utter helplessness touched her.  \"Come into the house; you must be cold.\" She was of a sudden all tenderness.  Through an outside winter doorway-shelter they entered a hall unusually large for an American's house and warmed by two great blazing hickory wood-fires. \"Come in,\" she cried, \"you'll be all right. Sit down by the fire; I'll be down in a minute, I want to see where Aunt Ann has put you.\"  \"I am much obliged,\" said John shivering. He was alone, but wet as he was the place captured an ever active imagination. He looked about him as he stood before the roaring fire. To the right was an open library, to the left a drawing-room rarely used, the hall being by choice the favoured sitting-room. The dining-room was built out from the back of the hall, whence up a broad stairway Leila had gone. The walls were hung with Indian painted robes, Sioux and Arapahoe weapons, old colonial rifles, and among them portraits of three generations of Penhallows. Many older people had found interesting the strange adornment of the walls, where amid antlered trophies of game, buffalo heads and war-worn Indian relics, could be read something of the owner's tastes and history. John stood by the fire fascinated. Like many timid boys, he liked books of adventure and to imagine himself heroic in situations of peril.  \"It's all right. Come up,\" cried Leila from the stair. \"Your trunk's there now. There's a fine fire.\"  Forgetful of the cold ride and of the snow down his back, he was standing before the feathered head-dress of a Sioux Chief and touching the tomahawk below it. He turned as she spoke. \"Those must be scalp-locks--three.\" He saw the prairie, the wild pursuit--saw them as she could not. He went after her upstairs, the girl talking, the boy rapt, lost in far-away battles on the plains.  \"This is your room. See what a nice fire. You can dry yourself. Your trunk is here already.\" She lighted two candles. \"We dine at half-past six.\"  \"Thank you; I am very much obliged,\" he said, thinking what a mannerless girl.  Leila closed the door and stood still a moment. Then she exclaimed, \"Well, I never! What will Uncle Jim say?\" She listened a moment. No one was in the hall. Then she laughed, and getting astride of the banister-rail made a wild, swift and perilous descent, alighting at the foot in the hall, and readjusting her short skirts as she heard her aunt and uncle on the porch. \"I was just in time,\" she exclaimed. \"Wouldn't I have caught it!\"  The Squire, as the village called him, would have applauded this form of coasting, but Aunt Ann had other views. \"Well!\" he said as they came in, \"what have you done with your young man?\"  Now he was for Leila anything but a man or manly, but she was a loyal little lady and unwilling to expose the guest to Uncle Jim's laughter. \"He's all right,\" she said, \"but Billy upset the sleigh.\" She was longing to tell about that ball in the stable, but refrained.  \"So Billy upset you; and John, where is he?\"  \"He's upstairs getting dried.\"  \"It is rather a rough welcome,\" remarked her aunt.  \"He lost his cap and his cane,\" said Leila.  \"His cane!\" exclaimed her uncle, \"his cane!\"  \"I must see him,\" said his wife.  \"Better let him alone, Ann.\" But as usual she took her own way and went upstairs. She came down in a few minutes, finding her husband standing before the fire--an erect, soldierly figure close to forty years of age.  \"Well, Ann?\" he queried.  \"A very nice lad, with such good manners, James.\"  \"Billy found his cap,\" said Leila, \"but he couldn't get the sleigh set up until the stable men came.\"  \"And that cane,\" laughed Penhallow. \"Was the boy amused or--or scared?\"  \"I don't know,\" which was hardly true, but the chivalry of childhood forbade tale-telling and he learned very little. \"He was rather tired and cold, so I made him go to his room and rest.\"  \"Poor child!\" said Aunt Ann.  James Penhallow looked at Leila. Some manner of signals were interchanged. \"I saw Billy digging in the big drift,\" he said. \"I trust he found the young gentleman's cane.\" Some pitying, dim comprehension of the delicately nurtured lad had brought to the social surface the kindliness of the girl and she said no more.  \"It is time to dress for dinner,\" said Ann. Away from the usages of the city she had wisely insisted on keeping up the social forms which the Squire would at times have been glad to disregard. For a moment Ann Penhallow lingered. \"We must try to make him feel at home, James.\"  \"Of course, my dear. I can imagine how Susan Penhallow would have educated a boy, and now I know quite too well what we shall have to undo--and--do.\"  \"You won't, oh! you will not be too hard on him.\"  \"I--no, my dear--but--I suspect his American education has begun already.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Ask Leila--and Billy. But that can wait.\" They separated.  While his elders were thus briefly discussing this new addition to the responsibilities of their busy lives, the subject of their talk had been warmed into comfortable repossession of his self-esteem. He set in order his elaborate silver toilet things marked with the Penhallow crest, saw in the glass that his dress and unboylike length of curly hair were as he had been taught they should be; then he looked at his watch and went slowly downstairs.  \"Halloa! John,\" he heard as he reached the last turn of the stairs. \"Most glad to see you. You are very welcome to your new home.\" The man who hailed him was six feet two inches, deep-chested, erect--the West Point figure; the face clean-shaven, ruddy, hazel-eyed, was radiant with the honest feeling of desire to put this childlike boy at ease.  The little gentleman needed no aid and replied, \"My dear uncle, I cannot sufficiently thank you.\" A little bow went with his words, and he placidly accepted his aunt's embrace, while the hearty Miss Leila looked on in silence. The boy's black suit, the short jacket, the neat black tie, made the paleness of his thin large-featured face too obvious. Then Leila took note of the court shoes and silk socks, and looked at Uncle Jim to see what he thought. The Squire reserved what criticism he may have had and asked cheerfully about the journey, Aunt Ann aiding him with eager will to make the boy feel at home. He was quite enough at home. It was all agreeable, these handsome relations and the other Penhallows on the walls. He had been taught that which is good or ill as men use it, pride of race, and in his capacity to be impressed by his surroundings was years older than Leila. He felt sure that he would like it here at Grey Pine, but was surprised to see no butler and to be waited on at dinner by two neat little maids.  When Ann Penhallow asked him about his schools and his life in Europe, he became critical, and conversed about picture-galleries and foreign life with no lack of accuracy, while the Squire listened smiling and Leila sat dumb with astonishment as the dinner went on. He ate little and kept in mind the endless lessons in regard to what he should or should not eat. Meanwhile, he silently approved of the old silver and these well-bred kinsfolk, with a reserve of doubt concerning his silent cousin.  His uncle had at last his one glass of Madeira, and as they rose his aunt said, \"You may be tired, John; you ought to go to bed early.\"  \"It is not yet time,\" he said. \"I always retire at ten o'clock.\"  \"He 'retires,'\" murmured his uncle. \"Come, Ann, we will leave Leila to make friends"]]]
