There were no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow.  And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.  [Illustration]  But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk, in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).  When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.  From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.  [Illustration]  First and loudest the cocks cried out: \"Dame, get up, and bake your pies!\"  \"Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!\" sighed Simpkin.  And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came from over the way.  \"Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in Gloucester--except me,\" said Simpkin.  Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jack-daws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full of little twittering tunes.  [Illustration]  But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin!  Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very small voices--especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep, like the Tailor of Gloucester.  They said something mysterious that sounded like--      \"Buz, quoth the blue fly, hum, quoth the bee,      Buz and hum they cry, and so do we!\"  and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.  [Illustration]  From the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily--              \"Four-and-twenty tailors              Went to catch a snail,              The best man amongst them              Durst not touch her tail,              She put out her horns              Like a little kyloe cow,     Run, tailors, run! or she'll have you all e'en now!\"  Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again--      \"Sieve my lady's oatmeal,      Grind my lady's flour,      Put it in a chestnut,      Let it stand an hour----\"  [Illustration]  \"Mew! Mew!\" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow, he could not get in.  The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--      \"Three little mice sat down to spin,      Pussy passed by and she peeped in.      What are you at, my fine little men?      Making coats for gentlemen.      Shall I come in and cut off your threads?      Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!\"  \"Mew! Mew!\" cried Simpkin. \"Hey diddle dinketty?\" answered the little mice--      \"Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet!      The merchants of London they wear scarlet;      Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,      So merrily march the merchantmen!\"  [Illustration]  They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.      \"And then I bought      A pipkin and a popkin,      A slipkin and a slopkin,      All for one farthing----  and upon the kitchen dresser!\" added the rude little mice.  \"Mew! scratch! scratch!\" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices: \"No more twist! No more twist!\" And they barred up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.  But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing--  [Illustration]  \"No more twist! No more twist!\"  Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.  Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!  When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!  [Illustration]  \"Alack, I am worn to a ravelling,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, \"but I have my twist!\"  The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.  The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang--but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.  \"Alack,\" said the tailor, \"I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry-coloured coat?\"  He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.  But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!  The boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.  But upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.  [Illustration]  There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.  [Illustration]  Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--                NO MORE TWIST  And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.  He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.  [Illustration]  Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his button-holes were the greatest triumph of it all.  The stitches of those button-holes were so neat--_so_ neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.  The stitches of those button-holes were so small--_so_ small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],["title","The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#0)"],["body","PERFECT WAGNERITE: A COMMENTARY ON THE NIBLUNG'S RING  by Bernard Shaw     Preface to the First German Edition  In reading through this German version of my book in the Manuscript of my friend Siegfried Trebitsch, I was struck by the inadequacy of the merely negative explanation given by me of the irrelevance of Night Falls On The Gods to the general philosophic scheme of The Ring. That explanation is correct as far as it goes; but, put as I put it, it now seems to me to suggest that the operatic character of Night Falls On The Gods was the result of indifference or forgetfulness produced by the lapse of twenty-five years between the first projection of the work and its completion. Now it is clear that in whatever other ways Wagner may have changed, he never became careless and he never became indifferent. I have therefore inserted a new section in which I show how the revolutionary history of Western Europe from the Liberal explosion of 1848 to the confused attempt at a socialist, military, and municipal administration in Paris in 1871 (that is to say, from the beginning of The Niblung's Ring by Wagner to the long-delayed completion of Night Falls On The Gods), demonstrated practically that the passing away of the present order was going to be a much more complicated business than it appears in Wagner's Siegfried. I have therefore interpolated a new chapter which will perhaps induce some readers of the original English text to read the book again in German.  For some time to come, indeed, I shall have to refer English readers to this German edition as the most complete in existence.  My obligation to Herr Trebitsch for making me a living German author instead of merely a translated English one is so great that I am bound to point out that he is not responsible for my views or Wagner's, and that it is as an artist and a man of letters, and not as a propagandist, that he is conveying to the German speaking peoples political criticisms which occasionally reflect on contemporary authorities with a European reputation for sensitiveness. And as the very sympathy which makes his translations so excellent may be regarded with suspicion, let me hasten to declare I am bound to Germany by the ties that hold my nature most strongly. Not that I like the average German: nobody does, even in his own country. But then the average man is not popular anywhere; and as no German considers himself an average one, each reader will, as an exceptional man, sympathize with my dislike of the common herd. And if I cannot love the typical modern German, I can at least pity and understand him. His worst fault is that he cannot see that it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Being convinced that duty, industry, education, loyalty, patriotism and respectability are good things (and I am magnanimous enough to admit that they are not altogether bad things when taken in strict moderation at the right time and in the right place), he indulges in them on all occasions shamelessly and excessively. He commits hideous crimes when crime is presented to him as part of his duty; his craze for work is more ruinous than the craze for drink; when he can afford secondary education for his sons you find three out of every five of them with their minds lamed for life by examinations which only a thoroughly wooden head could go through with impunity; and if a king is patriotic and respectable (few kings are) he puts up statues to him and exalts him above Charlemagne and Henry the Fowler. And when he meets a man of genius, he instinctively insults him, starves him, and, if possible, imprisons and kills him.  Now I do not pretend to be perfect myself. Heaven knows I have to struggle hard enough every day with what the Germans call my higher impulses. I know too well the temptation to be moral, to be self-sacrificing, to be loyal and patriotic, to be respectable and well-spoken of. But I wrestle with it and--as far as human fraility will allow--conquer it, whereas the German abandons himself to it without scruple or reflection, and is actually proud of his pious intemperance and self-indulgence. Nothing will cure him of this mania. It may end in starvation, crushing taxation, suppression of all freedom to try new social experiments and reform obsolete institutions, in snobbery, jobbery, idolatry, and an omnipresent tyranny in which his doctor and his schoolmaster, his lawyer and his priest, coerce him worse than any official or drill sergeant: no matter: it is respectable, says the German, therefore it must be good, and cannot be carried too far; and everybody who rebels against it must be a rascal. Even the Social-Democrats in Germany differ from the rest only in carrying academic orthodoxy beyond human endurance--beyond even German endurance. I am a Socialist and a Democrat myself, the hero of a hundred platforms, one of the leaders of the most notable Socialist organizations in England. I am as conspicuous in English Socialism as Bebel is in German Socialism; but do you suppose that the German Social-Democrats tolerate me? Not a bit of it. I have begged again and again to be taken to the bosom of my German comrades. I have pleaded that the Super-Proletarians of all lands should unite. I have pointed out that the German Social-Democratic party has done nothing at its Congresses for the last ten years except the things I told them to do ten years before, and that its path is white with the bones of the Socialist superstitions I and my fellow Fabians have slain. Useless. They do not care a rap whether I am a Socialist or not. All they want to know is; Am I orthodox? Am I correct in my revolutionary views? Am I reverent to the revolutionary authorities? Because I am a genuine free-thinker they look at me as a policeman looks at a midnight prowler or as a Berlin bourgeois looks at a suspicious foreigner. They ask \"Do you believe that Marx was omniscient and infallible; that Engels was his prophet; that Bebel and Singer are his inspired apostles; and that Das Kapital is the Bible?\" Hastening in my innocence to clear myself of what I regard as an accusation of credulity and ignorance, I assure them earnestly that I know ten times as much of economics and a hundred times as much of practical administration as Marx did; that I knew Engels personally and rather liked him as a witty and amiable old 1848 veteran who despised modern Socialism; that I regard Bebel and Singer as men of like passions with myself, but considerably less advanced; and that I read Das Kapital in the year 1882 or thereabouts, and still consider it one of the most important books of the nineteenth century because of its power of changing the minds of those who read it, in spite of its unsound capitalist economics, its parade of quotations from books which the author had either not read or not understood, its affectation of algebraic formulas, and its general attempt to disguise a masterpiece of propagandist journalism and prophetic invective as a drily scientific treatise of the sort that used to impose on people in 1860, when any book that pretended to be scientific was accepted as a Bible. In those days Darwin and Helmholtz were the real fathers of the Church; and nobody would listen to religion, poetry or rhetoric; so that even Socialism had to call itself \"scientific,\" and predict the date of the revolution, as if it were a comet, by calculations founded on \"historic laws.\"  To my amazement these reasonable remarks were received as hideous blasphemies; none of the party papers were allowed to print any word of mine; the very Revisionists themselves found that the scandal of my heresy damaged them more than my support aided them; and I found myself an outcast from German Social-Democracy at the moment when, thanks to Trebitsch, the German bourgeoisie and nobility began to smile on me, seduced by the pleasure of playing with fire, and perhaps by Agnes Sorma's acting as Candida.  Thus you may see that when a German, by becoming a Social-Democrat, throws off all the bonds of convention, and stands free from all allegiance to established religion, law, order, patriotism, and learning, he promptly uses his freedom to put on a headier set of chains; expels anti-militarists with the blood-thirstiest martial anti-foreign ardor; and gives the Kaiser reason to thank heaven that he was born in the comparative freedom and Laodicean tolerance of Kingship, and not in the Calvinistic bigotry and pedantry of Marxism.  Why, then, you may ask, do I say that I am bound to Germany by the ties that hold my nature most strongly? Very simply because I should have perished of despair in my youth but for the world created for me by that great German dynasty which began with Bach and will perhaps not end with Richard Strauss. Do not suppose for a moment that I learnt my art from English men of letters. True, they showed me how to handle English words; but if I had known no more than that, my works would never have crossed the Channel. My masters were the masters of a universal language: they were, to go from summit to summit, Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Wagner. Had the Germans understood any of these men, they would have hanged them. Fortunately they did not understand them, and therefore only neglected them until they were dead, after which they learnt to dance to their tunes with an easy conscience. For their sakes Germany stands consecrated as the Holy Land of the capitalist age, just as Italy, for its painters' sakes, is the Holy Land of the early unvulgarized Renascence; France, for its builders' sakes, of the age of Christian chivalry and faith; and Greece, for its sculptors' sakes, of the Periclean age.  These Holy Lands are my fatherlands: in them alone am I truly at home: all my work is but to bring the whole world under this sanctification.  And so, O worthy, respectable, dutiful, patriotic, brave, industrious German reader, you who used to fear only God and your own conscience,"]]]
