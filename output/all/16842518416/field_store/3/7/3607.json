The moral tone is plain. \"She is kind to the old blind man.\"  The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write. Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson numbers.

Copyright, 1896, by American Book Company Copyright, 1907 and 1920, by H. H. Vail.  EP316    Preface  In this book, as well as in the others of the Revised Series, most of the favorite drill selections, which constituted one of the leading excellences of MCGUFFEY'S READERS, have been retained. New selections have been inserted only when they seemed manifest improvements on those formerly used.  The plan of this Reader is a continuation and extension of that pursued in the First Reader.  If the pupil is not familiar with the diacritical marks, he should be carefully drilled, as suggested on page 7, until the marked letter instantly suggests the correct sound. He is then prepared to study his reading lessons without any assistance from the teacher.  All new words are given at the head of each lesson. When these are mastered, the main difficulties left for the pupil are those of expression. In the latter portion of the book the simpler derivatives,--such as are formed by adding one or two letters,--possessives, plurals, verbal forms, etc.,--are omitted if the primitive word has been given. In this way the pupil is gradually led to the mastery of words as ordinarily printed.  A few of the most usual abbreviations have been introduced,--such as Mr., Mrs., etc. These should be carefully explained, not only as to their meaning and use, but as to the reason for their use.  Great care has been taken to have the illustrations worthy of the reputation MCGUFFEY'S READERS have attained, and some of the foremost designers of this country have contributed to the embellishment of the book.  Many of these pictures will serve admirably for lessons in language, in extension and explanation of the text. The imagination of the artist has, in some cases, filled in details not found in the text.  The thanks of the publishers are due to very many experienced teachers, who have contributed their valuable suggestions.  June, 1879.     INTRODUCTORY MATTER.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.-Thorough and frequent drills on the elementary sounds are useful in correcting vicious habits of pronunciation and in strengthening the vocal organs.  As a rule, only one or two sounds should be employed at one lesson. Care should be taken that the pupils observe and practice these sounds correctly in their reading.    TABLE OF VOCALS.

Punctuation Marks are used to make the sense more clear.  A Period (.) is used at the end of a sentence, and after an abbreviation; as,     James was quite sick. Dr. Jones was called to see him.  An Interrogation Mark (?) is used at the end of a question; as,     Where is John going?  An Exclamation Mark (!) is used after words or sentences expressing some strong feeling; as,     Alas, my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!  The Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) are used to separate the parts of a sentence.  The Hyphen (-) is used to join the parts of a compound word; as, text-book: it is also used at the end of a line in print or script, when a word is divided; as in the word \"sentence,\" near the bottom of page 9.

They learned their lessons well to-day, and both feel happy  3. Tea is over. Mrs. Brown has put the little sitting room in order. The fire burns brightly. One lamp gives light enough for all. On the stool is a basket of fine apples. They seem to say, \"Won't you have one?\"  4. Harry and Kate read a story in a new book. The father reads his newspaper, and the mother mends Harry's stockings.  5. By and by, they will tell one another what they have been reading about, and will have a chat over the events of the day.  6. Harry and Kate's bedtime will come first. I think I see them kiss their dear father and mother a sweet good night.  7. Do you not wish that every boy and girl could have a home like this?

The boys have come out on the porch to blow bubbles. The old cat is asleep on the mat by the door.  2. \"Ha! ha!\" laughs Robert, as a bubble comes down softly on the old cat's back, and does not burst.  3. Willie tries to make his bubble do the same. This time it comes down on the cat's face, and makes her sneeze.  4. \"She would rather wash her face without soap,\" says Harry. \"Now let us see who can make the biggest bubble.\"  5. \"Mine is the biggest,\" says Robert. \"See how high it floats in the air! I can see--ah! it has burst.\"  6. \"I can see the house and the trees and the sky in mine,\" says Willie; \"and such beautiful colors.\"  7.  \"How many, Willie?\"  8. \"Red, one; blue, two; there--they are all out.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star;    How I wonder what you are,    Up above the world so high,    Like a diamond in the sky!  2. When the blazing sun is set,    And the grass with dew is wet,    Then you show your little light;    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.  3. Then, if I were in the dark,    I would thank you for your spark.    I could not see which way to go,    If you did not twinkle so.  4. And when I am sound asleep,    Oft you through my window peep;    For you never shut your eye,    Till the sun is in the sky.

James White has two dogs. One is a Newfoundland dog, and the other is a Scotch terrier.  2. The Newfoundland is a large, noble fellow. He is black, with a white spot, and with long, shaggy hair. His name is Sport.  3. Sport is a good watchdog, and a kind playfellow. Every night he guards the house while James and his father are asleep.  4. In the daytime, James often uses Sport for his horse. He has a little wagon, and a set of small harness which just fits the dog.  5. He hitches Sport to this wagon, and drives over the country. In this way, he can go almost as fast as his father with the old family horse.  6. The name of James's Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table, behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.  7. Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to put his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.  8. The other day he took baby's red stocking, and had great fun with it; but he spoiled it in his play, and James had to scold him.  9. Everyone likes to see James White with his two dogs. They always seem very happy together.

She thought he had not heard.  3.  \"I'm afraid,\" said Willie.  4.  \"Afraid of what?\"  5.  \"It's dark up there.\"  6.  \"What is the dark?\" asked mamma. \"See! It is nothing but a shadow.\" And she held her hand between the lamp and the workbasket on the table.  [Illustration: Mother, seated in rocking chair, kerosene lamp on table, boy standing, examining his shadow on the wall.]  7. \"Now it is dark in the basket; but as soon as I take my hand away, it is light.\"  8. \"Come and stand between the lamp and the wall, Willie. See! There is your shadow on the wall. Can your shadow hurt you?\"  9. \"Oh no, mamma! I am sure it can not hurt me.\"  10. \"Well, the dark is only a big shadow over everything.\"  11. \"What makes the big shadow, mamma?\"  12. \"I will tell you all about that, Willie, when you are a little older. But now, I wish you would find me a brave boy who is not afraid of shadows, to run upstairs and get my needlebook.\"  13. \"I am bravo, mamma. I will go. --Here it is.\"  14. \"Thank you, my brave little man. You see the dark didn't hurt you.\"  SLATE WORK.

Puss, with her three kittens, had lived in the coal cellar; but one day she thought she would carry them to the attic.  2. The servant thought that was not the proper place for them; so she carried them back to the cellar.  3. Puss was certain that she wanted them in the attic; so she carried them there again and again, five, six, seven, --yes, a dozen times; for each time the servant took them back to the cellar.  4. Poor puss was nearly tired out, and could carry them no longer.  5. Suddenly she went away. Where do you think she went?  6. She was gone a long time. When she returned, she had a strange cat with her that we had never seen before.  7. She seemed to tell him all about her great trouble, and he listened to her story.  8. Then the strange cat took the little kittens, one by one, and carried them to the attic. After this he went away, and we have never seen him since.  9. The servant then left the kittens in the attic, for she saw how anxious puss was to have them stay there.  10. Was not the strange cat kind to puss?

Once there was a little kitty,      White as the snow;    In a barn he used to frolic,      Long time ago.  2. In the barn a little mousie      Ran to and fro;    For she heard the little kitty,      Long time ago.  3. Two black eyes had little kitty,      Black as a crow;    And they spied the little mousie,      Long time ago.  4. Four soft paws had little kitty,      Paws soft as snow;    And they caught the little mousie,      Long time ago.  5. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,      All in a row;    And they bit the little mousie,      Long time ago.  6. When the teeth bit little mousie,      Mousie cried out \"Oh!\"    But she slipped away from kitty,      Long time ago.

After play, we should be glad to work.  2. I knew a boy who liked a good game very much. He could run, swim, jump, and play ball; and was always merry when out of school.  3. But he knew that time is not all for play; that our minutes, hours, and days are very precious.  4. At the end of his play, he would go home. After he had washed his face and hands, and brushed his hair, he would help his mother, or read in his book, or write upon his slate.  5. He used to say, \"One thing at a time.\" When he had done with work, he would play; but he did not try to play and to work at the same time.

Her grandfather first gave her this name, and it seemed to fit the little girl so nicely that soon it took the place of her own.  3. Even when a baby, Susie laughed and crowed from morning till night. No one ever heard her cry unless she was sick or hurt.  4. When she had learned to walk, she loved to go about the house and get things for her mother, and in this way save her as many steps as she could.  5. She would sit by her mother's side for an hour at a time, and ask her ever so many questions, or she would take her new book and read.  6. Susie was always pleasant"]]]
