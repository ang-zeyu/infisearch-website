Probably because he has learned better.\"  \"Oh!\" said one of the Merry Little Breezes, in a rather faint, disappointed sort of voice. Just then he spied a fat, foolish, green fly and blew it right over to Grandfather Frog, who snapped it up in a flash. Right away all the Merry Little Breezes began to hunt for foolish green flies and blow them over to Grandfather Frog, until he didn't have room for another one inside his white and yellow waistcoat. Indeed the legs of the last one he tried to swallow stuck out of one corner of his big mouth.  \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog, trying very hard to get those legs out of sight. \"Chug-a-rum! I always like to do something for those who do something for me, and I suppose now that I ought to tell you why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries. I would, if Peter Rabbit were here. If I tell you the story, Peter will be sure to hear of it, and then he will give me no peace until I tell it to him, and I don't like to tell stories twice.\"  \"But he is here!\" cried one of the Little Breezes. \"He's right over behind that little clump of tall grass.\"  \"Humph! I thought he wasn't very far away,\" grunted Grandfather Frog, with a twinkle in his great, goggly eyes.  Peter crept out of his hiding-place, looking rather shamefaced and very foolish. Then the Merry Little Breezes settled themselves on the lily-pads in a big circle around Grandfather Frog, and Peter sat down as close to the edge of the bank of the Smiling Pool as he dared to get. After what seemed to them a very long time, Grandfather Frog swallowed the legs of the last foolish green fly, opened his big mouth, and began:  \"Of course you all know that long, long ago, when the world was young, things were very different from what they are now, very different indeed. The great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Jimmy Skunk was slimmer and trimmer than Jimmy is. He was more like his cousins, Mr. Weasel and Mr. Mink. He was just as quick moving as they were. Yes, Sir, Mr. Skunk was very lively on his feet. He had to be to keep out of the way of his big neighbors, for in those days he didn't have any means of protecting himself, as Jimmy has now. He was dressed all in black. You know it wasn't until Old Mother Nature found out that he was taking advantage of that black suit to get into mischief on dark nights that she gave him white stripes, so that the darker the night, the harder it would be for him to keep from being seen.  \"Now Mr. Skunk was very smart and shrewd, oh, very! When the hard times came, which made so many changes in the lives of the people who lived in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows, Mr. Skunk was very quick to see that unless he could think of some way to protect himself, it was only a matter of time when he would furnish a dinner for one of his fierce big neighbors, and of course Mr. Skunk had no desire to do that. It was then that he asked Old Mother Nature to give him a bag of perfume so strong that it would make everybody ill but himself. Mother Nature thought it all over, and then she did, but she made him promise that he would never use it unless he was in great danger.  \"Mr. Skunk had to try his new defence only once or twice before his enemies took the greatest care to let him alone. He found that he no longer had to run for a safe hiding-place when he met Mr. Wolf or Mr. Lynx or Mr. Panther. They just snarled at him and passed without offering to touch him. So Mr. Skunk grew very independent and went where he pleased when he pleased. And, because he no longer had to run from his enemies, he got out of the habit of running. Then he made a discovery. He watched those of his neighbors who were forever hurrying about looking for food, hurrying because all the time there was great fear upon them that an enemy might be near, hurrying because each was fearful that his neighbor would get more than he. It wasn't long before Mr. Skunk saw that in their hurry they overlooked a great deal. In fact, by just following after them slowly, he found all he wanted to eat.  \"So Mr. Skunk began to grow fat. His neighbors, who were having hard work to make a living, grew envious, and said unkind things about him, and hinted that he must be stealing, or he never could have so much to eat. But Mr. Skunk didn't mind. He went right on about his business. He never worried, because, you know, he feared nobody. And he never hurried, because he found that it paid best to go slowly. In that way he never missed any of the good things that his hurrying, worrying neighbors did. So he grew fatter and fatter, while others grew thinner. After a while he almost forgot how to run. Being fat and never hurrying or worrying made him good-natured. He kept right on minding his own affairs and never meddling in the affairs of others, so that by and by his neighbors began to respect him.  \"Of course he taught his children to do as he did, and they taught their children. And so, ever since that long-ago day, when the world was young, that little bag of perfume has been handed down in the Skunk family, and none of them has ever been afraid. Now you know why Jimmy Skunk, whom you all know, is so independent and never hurries.\"  \"Thank you! Thank you, Grandfather Frog!\" cried the Merry Little Breezes. \"When you want some more foolish green flies, just let us know, and we'll get them for you.\"  \"Chug-a-rum! What are you looking so wistful for, Peter Rabbit?\" demanded Grandfather Frog.  \"I--I was just wishing that I had a--\" began Peter. Then suddenly he made a face. \"No, I don't either!\" he declared. \"I guess I'd better be getting home to the dear Old Briar-patch now. Mrs. Peter probably thinks something has happened to me.\" And away he went, lipperty-lipperty-lip.     VI  WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT   Sammy Jay has a very fine coat, a very beautiful coat. Everybody knows that. In fact, Sammy's coat has long been the envy of a great many of his neighbors in the Green Forest. Some of them, you know, have very modest coats. They are not beautiful at all. And yet the owners of some of these plain coats are among the most honest and hard-working of all the little people who live in the Green Forest. They find it hard, very hard indeed, to understand why such a scamp and mischiefmaker as Sammy Jay should be given such a wonderful blue coat with white trimmings.  Peter Rabbit often had thought about it. He has a number of feathered friends whom he likes ever so much better than he does Sammy Jay. In fact, he and Sammy are forever falling out, because Sammy delights to tease Peter. He sometimes makes up for it by warning Peter when Granny or Reddy Fox happens to be about, and Peter is honest enough to recognize this and put it to Sammy's credit. But in spite of this, it never seemed to him quite right that Sammy Jay should be so handsomely dressed.  \"Of course,\" said Peter to Grandfather Frog, \"Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more than I do--\"  \"Really! You don't mean to say so! Chug-a-rum! You don't mean to say so, Peter!\" interrupted Grandfather Frog, pretending to be very much surprised at what Peter said.  [Illustration: \"You don't mean to say so, Peter,\" interrupted Grandfather Frog.]  Peter grinned and wrinkled his nose at Grandfather Frog.  \"Yes,\" said he, \"Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more than I do, but it seems to me as if she had made a mistake in giving Sammy Jay such a handsome coat. There must be a reason, I suppose, but for the life of me I cannot understand it. I should think that she would give such a thief as Sammy Jay the very homeliest suit she could find. You may depend I would, if I were in her place.\"  Grandfather Frog chuckled until he shook all over.  \"It's lucky for some of us that you are not in her place!\" said he. \"Chug-a-rum! It certainly is lucky!\"  \"If I were, I would give you a handsome coat, too, Grandfather Frog,\" replied Peter.  Grandfather Frog suddenly swelled out with indignation. \"Chug-a-rum! Chug-a-rum! What's the matter with the coat I have got, Peter Rabbit? Tell me that! Who's got a handsomer one?\" Grandfather Frog glared with his great, goggly eyes at Peter.  \"I didn't mean to say that you haven't got a handsome coat. Your coat _is_ handsome, very handsome indeed, Grandfather Frog,\" Peter hastened to say. \"I always did like green. I just love it! And I should think you would be ever so proud of your white and yellow waistcoat. I would if it were mine. What I meant to say is, that if I were in Old Mother Nature's place, I would give some plain folks handsome suits. Certainly, I wouldn't give such a rascal as Sammy Jay one of the handsomest coats in all the Green Forest. Knowing Sammy as well as I do, it is hard work to believe that he came by it honestly.\"  Grandfather Frog chuckled way down deep in his throat.  \"Sammy came by it honestly enough, Peter. Yes, Sir, he came by it honestly enough, because it was handed down to him by his father, who got it from his father, who got it from his father, and so on, way back to the days when the world was young, but--\" Grandfather Frog paused, and that dreamy, far-away look which Peter had seen so often came into his great, goggly eyes.  \"But what, Grandfather Frog?\" asked Peter eagerly, when he could keep still no longer.  Grandfather Frog settled himself comfortably on his big green lily-pad and looked very hard at Peter.  \"I'm going to tell you a story, Peter Rabbit,\" said he, \"so that never again will you be led to doubt that Old Mother Nature knows exactly what she is about. In the first place, Sammy Jay is not wholly to blame for all his bad habits. Some of them were handed down to him with his fine coat, just the same as your troublesome curiosity was handed down to you with the white patch on the seat of your trousers.\"  Peter nodded. He had felt a great many times that he just couldn't help this habit of poking that wobbly little nose of his in where it had no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],["title","Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#5)"],["body","to be, any more than he could change that funny little bunch of white cotton, which he called a tail, for a really, truly tail.  \"Of course, you have heard all about what a very fine gentleman Sammy Jay's great-great-ever-so-great grandfather was thought to be until it was discovered that he was all the time stealing from his neighbors and putting the blame on others, and how Old Mother Nature punished him by taking away the beautiful voice of which he was so proud, and giving him instead the harsh voice which Sammy has now, and making him tell just what he is by screaming 'thief, thief, thief!' every time he opens his mouth to speak.  \"At first Old Mother Nature had intended to take away the fine coat of which Mr. Jay was so proud, but when he discovered that he had lost his fine voice, he was so ashamed that he hurried away to hide himself from the eyes of his neighbors, so that Old Mother Nature didn't have time to change his coat just then.  'I'll wait a bit,' said she to herself, 'and see how he behaves. Perhaps he is truly sorry for what he has done, and I will not have to punish him more.'  \"But if Mr. Jay was truly sorry, he gave no signs of it. You see, he had cheated his neighbors, and had stolen from them for so long, that he found this the easiest way to get a living. His bad habits had become fixed, as bad habits have a way of doing. Besides, right down in his heart, he wasn't sorry for what he had done, only angry at having been found out. Now that he had been found out, of course every one was on the watch for him, and it wasn't so easy to steal as it had been before. So now, instead of going about openly, with his head held high, he grew very crafty, and sneaked quietly about through the Green Forest, trying to keep out of sight, that he might the easier steal from his neighbors and make trouble for them.  \"When Old Mother Nature saw this, she changed her mind about taking away his handsome suit. 'If I do that,' thought she, 'it will make it all the easier for him to keep out of sight, and all the harder for his neighbors to know when he is about.'  \"So instead of giving him the plain, homely suit that she had thought of giving him, she made his coat of blue brighter than before and trimmed it with the whitest of white trimmings, so that Mr. Jay had one of the very handsomest coats in all the Green Forest. At first he was very proud of it, but it wasn't long before he found that it was very hard work to keep out of sight when he wanted to. That bright blue coat was forever giving him away when he was out on mischief. Everybody was all the time on the watch for it, and so where in the past Mr. Jay had been able, without any trouble, to steal all he wanted to eat, now he sometimes actually had to work for his food, and get it honestly or else go hungry.  \"You would suppose that he would have mended him ways, wouldn't you?\"  Peter nodded.  \"But he didn't. He grew more sly and crafty than ever. But in spite of this, he didn't begin to make as much trouble as before. He couldn't, you know, because of his bright coat. When Old Mother Nature found that Mr. Jay had passed along his bad habits to his children, she passed along his handsome blue coat, too, and so it has been from that long-ago day right down to this. Sammy Jay's fine coat isn't a reward for goodness, as is Winsome Bluebird's, but is to help the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows to protect themselves, and keep track of Sammy when he is sneaking and snooping around looking for mischief. Now what do you think, Peter Rabbit?\"  Peter scratched one long ear and then the other long ear thoughtfully, and he looked a wee bit ashamed as he replied: \"I guess Old Mother Nature makes no mistakes and always knows just what she is doing.\"  \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest voice. \"You may be sure she does. And another thing, Peter Rabbit: Never judge any one by his clothes. It is a great mistake, a very great mistake. Plain clothes sometimes cover the kindest hearts, and fine clothes often are a warning to beware of mischief.\"  \"I--I don't know but you are right,\" admitted Peter.  \"I know I am,\" said Grandfather Frog.     VII  WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER   Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck had gone down to the Smiling Pool for a call on their old friend, Jerry Muskrat. But Jerry was nowhere to be seen. They waited and waited, but no Jerry Muskrat.  \"Probably he is taking a nap in that big house of his,\" said Johnny Chuck, \"and if he is we'll have to sit here until he wakes up, or else go back home and visit him some other time.\"  \"That's so,\" replied Peter. \"I don't see what he has his house in the water for, anyway. If he had built it on land, like sensible people, we might be able to waken him. Funny place to build a house, isn't it?\"  Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully. \"It does seem a funny place,\" he admitted. \"It certainly does seem a funny place. But then, Jerry Muskrat is a funny fellow. You know how much of the time he stays in the water. That seems funny to me. I suppose there is a reason for it, and probably there is a reason for building his house where it is. I've found that there is a reason for most things. Probably Jerry's great-great-grandfather built his house that way, and so Jerry does the same thing.\"  Peter Rabbit suddenly brightened up. \"I do believe you are right, Johnny Chuck, and if you are, there must be a story about it, and if there is a story, Grandfather Frog will be sure to know it. There he is, over on his big green lily-pad, and he looks as if he might be feeling very good-natured this morning. Let's go ask him why Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water.\"  Grandfather Frog saw them coming, and he guessed right away that they were coming for a story. He grinned to himself and pretended to go to sleep.  \"Good morning, Grandfather Frog,\" said Johnny Chuck. Grandfather Frog didn't answer. Johnny tried again, and still no reply.  \"He's asleep,\" said Johnny, looking dreadfully disappointed, \"and I guess we'd better not disturb him, for he might wake up cross, and of course we wouldn't get a story if he did.\"  Peter looked at Grandfather Frog sharply. He wasn't so sure that that was a real nap. It seemed to him that there was just the least little hint of a smile in the corners of Grandfather Frog's big mouth. \"You sit here a minute,\" he whispered in Johnny Chuck's ear.  So Johnny Chuck sat down where he was, which was right where Grandfather Frog could see him by lifting one eyelid just the teeniest bit, and Peter hopped along the bank until he was right behind Grandfather Frog. Now just at that place on the bank was growing a toadstool. Peter looked over at Johnny Chuck and winked. Then he turned around, and with one of his long hind-feet, he kicked the toadstool with all his might. Now toadstools, as you all know, are not very well fastened at the roots, and this one was no different from the rest. When Peter kicked it it flew out into the air and landed with a great splash in the Smiling Pool, close beside the big green lily-pad on which Grandfather Frog was sitting. Of course he didn't see it coming, and of course it gave him a great start.  \"Chug-a-rum!\" exclaimed Grandfather Frog and dived head first into the water. A minute later Peter's sharp eyes saw him peeping out from under a lily-pad to see what had frightened him so.  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" shouted Peter, dancing about on the bank. \"Ha, ha, ha! Grandfather Frog, afraid of a toadstool! Ha, ha, ha!\"  At first Grandfather Frog was angry, very angry indeed. But he is too old and too wise to lose his temper for long over a joke, especially when he has been fairly caught trying to play a joke himself. So presently he climbed back on to his big green lily-pad, blinking his great, goggly eyes and looking just a wee bit foolish.  \"Chug-a-rum! I might have known that that was some of your work, Peter Rabbit,\" said he, \"but I thought it surely was a stone thrown by Farmer Brown's boy. What do you mean by frightening an old fellow like me this way?\"  \"Just trying to get even with you for trying to fool us into thinking that you were asleep when you were wide awake,\" replied Peter. \"Oh, Grandfather Frog, do tell us why it is that Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water. Please do!\"  \"I have a mind not to, just to get even with you,\" said Grandfather Frog, settling himself comfortably, \"but I believe I will, to show you that there are some folks who can take a joke without losing their temper.\"  \"Goody!\" cried Peter and Johnny Chuck together, sitting down side by side on the very edge of the bank.  Grandfather Frog folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat and half closed his eyes, as if looking way, way back into the past.  \"Chug-a-rum!\" he began. \"A long, long time ago, when the world was young, there was very little dry land, and most of the animals lived in the water. Yes, Sir, most of the animals lived in the water, as sensible animals do to-day.\"  Peter nudged Johnny Chuck. \"He means himself and his family,\" he whispered with a chuckle.  \"After a time,\" continued Grandfather Frog, \"there began to be more land and still more. Then some of the animals began to spend most of their time on the land. As there got to be more and more land, more and more of the animals left the water, until finally most of them were spending nearly all of the time on land. Now Old Mother Nature had been keeping a sharp watch, as she always does, and when she found that they were foolish enough to like the land best, she did all that she could to make things comfortable for them. She taught them how to run and jump and climb and dig, according to which things they liked best to do, so that it wasn't very long before a lot of them forgot that they ever had lived in the water, and they began to look down on those who still lived in the water, and to put on airs and hold their heads very high.  \"Now, of"]]]
