So many ask me that question, with the further pathetic addition,--Will they always have to keep it up? And it ever irritates me.  The answer is,--Yes! You will always have to keep up dieting, just as you always have to keep up other things in life that make it worth living--being neat, being kind, being tender; reading, studying, loving.  You will not have to be nearly so strenuous after you get to normal; _but you might as well recognize now, and accept it as a fact, that neither you nor anybody else will be able to eat beyond your needs without accumulating fat or disease, or both._  I love Billy Sunday's classical answer to the objection that his conversions were not permanent. He responded: \"Neither is a bath!\"  WHEN YOU START TO REDUCE you will have the following to combat:  [Sidenote: _A Combat_]  First: Your husband, who tells you that he does not like thin women. I almost hate my husband when I think how long he kept me under that delusion. Now, of course, I know all about his jealous disposition, and how he did not want me to be attractive.  [Illustration: _Green!_]  Second: Your sister, who says, \"Goodness, Lou, but you look old today; you looked lots better as you were.\"  [Illustration: _Sweet Peace_]  Third: Your friends, who tell you that you are just right now; don't lose another pound! And other friends who tell you cheerful tales of people they have known who reduced, and who went into a decline, and finally died.  [Sidenote: _To Avoid Slack in Your Neck, Double and Triple Chins, Massage Vigorously Up and Down, Not Crossways_]  [Sidenote: _I Am Interesting_]  But you must not mind them. Smile, and tell them that you know all about it, and don't worry. Go serenely on your way, confident in your heart that you will look fully ten years younger when you get down to normal, no matter how you look in the interim. I don't see why women, and men, too, (secretly) worry so much about wrinkles. If the increased wrinkles on the face are accompanied by increased wrinkles in the gray matter, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. I'm sure I am much more interesting with wrinkles than I was without. I am to myself, anyway.  However, you will not be any more wrinkled if you reduce gradually, as I advise, and keep up your exercises at least fifteen minutes daily.  [Sidenote: _I Have a Beautiful Complexion_]  [Sidenote: _I Attended an Art School Six Months Once_]  Take care of your face, alternate hot and cold water, glycerine one-quarter, rose water three-quarters, cold cream packs, massage gently, a little ice--you know what to do--you need not fear. You will not only look ten years younger and live twenty years longer--I assert it boldly--but your complexion and efficiency will be one hundred per cent better.  [Sidenote: _Joy_!]  If there is anything comparable to the joy of taking in your clothes, I have not experienced it. And when you find your corset coming closer and closer together (I advise a front lace, so this can be watched), and then the day you realize that you will have to stitch in a tuck or get a new one!  But don't be in a hurry to make your clothes smaller now. If they are loose they will show to the world that you are reducing. A fat person in a tight suit, unless it is perfectly new, should be interned.  [Sidenote: _Food Only_]  [Sidenote: _Impossible_]  I have said that food, and food only, causes fat. That gives you the cue to what you must do to get rid of it. No anti-fat medicines unless under the supervision of your scientific, educated physician. They are dangerous; most of them contain thyroid extract, arsenic, or mercury. Even the vendors of these harmful compounds in their advertisements are now saying to \"stop harmful drugging,\" but urge you to adopt their particular delightful product, and, \"without dieting or exercises, you will positively reduce,\" and so forth.  No drastic purges, no violent exercises, especially at first, and not too frequent nor prolonged Turkish baths. Epsom salts baths have little effect. If salts are used habitually internally, they are harmful. All of these are unscientific and unsuccessful, and the things they bring on are worse than the fat.  Now, if food is the only source of body substance, you see that you must study that question, and that is what I will give you--some lessons on foods and their values.  [Sidenote: _Candy Cake, Pie, Rich Meats, Thick Gravy, Bread, Butter, Nuts, Ice Cream_]  [Sidenote: _Whipped Cream, Candied Sweet Potatoes_]  Heretofore you have known only in a dumb, despairing sort of way that all the foods you like are fattening, and all the advice you read and hear is that you must avoid them as a pestilence. And you settle down to your joyless fatness, realizing that it is beyond human strength to do that forever, and that you would rather die young and fat, anyway, than to have nothing to eat all your life but a little meat, fish, and sloshy vegetables. Study on, and you will find the reason your favorite foods are fattening.  But cast off your dejection. _You don't have to avoid them_!  Eat what you like and grow thin? Yes; follow me. I know it will be an exertion, but you must persist and go through with it. Nothing in life worth while is attained without some effort. So begin now; it is the price of liberty.   _Review_  1. Give rule for normal weight.  2. How much excess food have you stored away?  3. Why more important than ever to reduce?  4. Why are fat individuals fireless cookers?  5. Give causes of excess fat.  _NOTE: The Reviews which follow the chapters are important and the questions should be answered. To get the full benefit, Little Book must be studied, for it is the only authorized textbook of the \"Watch Your Weights_.\"     2  Key to the Calories   Some one page the thin? They come back here.  [Sidenote: _Don't Skip This_]  Definition to learn:  CALORIE; symbol C.; a heat unit and food value unit; is that amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit.  [Sidenote: _Pronounced Kal'-o-ri_]  There is a good deal of effort expended by many semi-educated individuals to discredit the knowledge of calories, saying that it is a foolish food science, a fallacy, a fetish, and so forth.  They reason, or rather say, that because there are no calories in some of the very vital elements of foods--the vitamines and the mineral salts--therefore it is not necessary to know about them. They further argue that their grandfathers never heard of calories and they got along all right. That grandfather argument always enrages my mortal mind.  [Sidenote: _A Unit of Measure_]  Now you know that a calorie is a unit of measuring heat and food. It is not heat, not food; simply a unit of measure. And as food is of supreme importance, certainly a knowledge of how it should be measured is also of supreme importance.  [Sidenote: _Yes, They Are Kosher_]  You should know and also use the word calorie as frequently, or more frequently, than you use the words foot, yard, quart, gallon, and so forth, as measures of length and of liquids. Hereafter you are going to eat calories of food. Instead of saying one slice of bread, or a piece of pie, you will say 100 Calories of bread, 350 Calories of pie.  The following is the way the calorie is determined:  An apparatus known as the bomb calorimeter has two chambers, the inner, which contains the dry food to be burned, say a definite amount of sugar, and an outer, which is filled with water. The food is ignited with an electric connection and burned. This heat is transferred to the water. When one pound of water is raised 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the amount of heat used is arbitrarily chosen as the unit of heat, and is called the Calorie.  Food burned (oxydized) in the body has been proved to give off approximately the same amount of heat or energy as when burned in the calorimeter.  [Sidenote: _Approximate Measures_]       1 oz. Fat                 = 275 C.                                --about 255 in the body.       1 oz. Protein (dry)       = 120 C.                                --about 113 in the body.       1 oz. Carbohydrates (dry) = 120 C.                                --about 113 in the body.       (ROSE.)  Can you see now why fats are valuable? Why they make fat more than any other food? They give off more than two and one-fourth times as much heat, or energy, as the other foods.  [Sidenote: _See Next Chapter for Definitions_]  Notice that protein and carbohydrates have the same food value as to heat or energy, each 113 Calories to the dry ounce. However, they are not interchangeable; that is, carbohydrates will not take the place of protein for protein is absolutely necessary to build and repair tissue, and carbohydrates cannot do that. But fats and carbohydrates are interchangeable as fuel or energy foods.  _Calories Needed per Day for Normal Individuals_  [Sidenote: _Business of Growing_]  This depends upon age, weight, and physical activities; the baby and the growing child needing many more calories per pound per day than the adult, who has to supply only his energy and repair needs. The aged require still less than the young adult. As to weight; I have told you why overweight individuals need so little. As to physical activities; the more active, obviously the more calories needed, for every movement consumes calories.  [Sidenote: _Many Know Nothing of This_]  The Maine lumbermen, for instance, while working during the winter months, consume from 5000 to 8000 Calories per day. But they do a tremendous amount of physical work.  _Mental work does not require added nourishment._ This has been proved, and if an excess be taken over what is needed at rest (if considerable exercise is not taken while doing the mental work) the work is not so well done.

Determine normal weight by rule.  2. Multiply normal weight by number of calories needed per pound per day.  For example, say you weigh 220 or 125 lbs., but by the rule for your height your weight should be 150 lbs.; then 150 would be the number you would use.  [Sidenote: _Work Out Your Requirements_]  By the rule I have given, adults require 15-20 Calories per pound per day, depending upon activity. For example, if you have no physical activities, then take the lowest figure, 15. 150x15--2250. Therefore your requirement, if your weight should be 150, is 2250 Calories per day.  Now, if you want to lose, cut down 500-1000 Calories per day from that.  Five hundred Calories equal approximately 2 ounces of fat. Two ounces per day would be about 4 pounds per month, or 48 pounds per year. Cutting out 1000 Calories per day would equal a reduction of approximately 8 pounds per month, or 96 pounds per year. These pounds you can absolutely lose by having a knowledge of food values (calories) and regulating your intake accordingly. You can now see the importance of a knowledge of calories.

[Sidenote: _Approx. %'s if Normal_]  CLASSES OF FOOD:       1. Protein, 18% of body weight.      2. Fats, 16% of body weight.      3. Carbohydrates, 1% of body weight.      4. Mineral matter, 5% of body weight.      5. Vitamines.      6. Water, 60% of body weight.  [Sidenote: _Nitrogenous Food Compounds_]  PROTEIN: Builds tissue, repairs waste, yields energy, and may help store fat. One-half, at least, of your protein should be from the vegetable kingdom.  A large percentage of protein is contained in       Eggs      Meat      Fowl   Fish   Nuts      Milk      Cheese     Gluten of Wheat      Legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, etc.)  [Sidenote: _Protein 113 C. Per Oz._]  There is about one-fourth ounce protein in       1 egg      1 glass milk (skim, butter, or whole)      1-1/2 oz. lean meat, or fish or fowl      1 oz. (1-1/5 cu. in.) whole milk cheese      2 slices of bread, 3-1/2 x 3-1/2 x 1/2        (white, whole wheat, corn, etc.)      3 heaping tablespoonfuls canned baked beans or lima beans      17 peanuts  [Sidenote: _255 C. Per Oz._]  FATS: Yield energy and are stored as fat.  Animal Fat: Cream, Butter, Lard  Oils: Cottonseed, Olive Almonds, Peanuts, Walnuts Chocolate, etc.  [Sidenote: _113 C. Per Oz._]  CARBOHYDRATES: Yield energy and are stored as fat.  Sugars (candy, honey, syrup, sweet fruits)  Starches (breads, cereals, potatoes, corn, legumes, nuts)  Vegetable fibre, or cellulose  MINERAL MATTER: Shares in forming bones and teeth, and is necessary for proper functioning.       Carbon   Lime  Sodium      Potassium,      Sulphur  Iron  Phosphorus  Etc.  [Sidenote: _Whole Grain Products Not Devitalized_]  These elements are contained largely in the outer coatings of grains, fruits, and vegetables, and in animal foods and their products. Do not pare potatoes before cooking. Cook vegetables in a small amount of water, saving the water for soups and sauces.  WATER: The universal solvent, absolutely necessary for life.  Contained in purest form in all vegetables and fruits. The average person needs, in addition, from three to five pints taken as a drink. If not sure of the purity, boil. Do not drink while food is in the mouth.  [Sidenote: _Absolutely Necessary for Growth_]  VITAMINES: Health preservers. Vital substances necessary for growth. The chemistry of these products is at present not thoroughly understood, but their importance has been demonstrated by experiments (not torture) on animals. By this work we know that diseases like beri-beri, scurvy, rickets, and probably pellagra, are due to a lack of these vital elements in the food, and from that fact these are called \"deficiency\" diseases.  [Sidenote: _Guinea Pigs vs. Babies_]  Of course I realize that nations can be saved from horrible diseases, and hundreds and thousands of babies saved from death, through this experimentation on a few guinea pigs and other animals; but what is the life of a baby compared with the happiness of a guinea pig? Down with animal experimentation! Let us do everything in our power to hamper scientific work of this kind. We are giving up our husbands, fathers, sons, perhaps to die, for the cause of humanity, but a guinea pig! Horrors!  It has been found that the vitamines, like the minerals, are most abundant in the outer coverings and the germ of grains, and in fruits and vegetables. They are also present in fresh milk, butter, meat and eggs. Babies fed pasteurized or boiled milk should have fruit juices and vegetable purees early. Begin with one-half teaspoonful, well diluted, and gradually increase the feeding to an ounce or more between meals once or twice daily.  Most animal fats have the vitamines, but vegetable fats are deficient in them. That is the reason cod liver oil is better for some therapeutic uses than olive oil.  [Sidenote: _Balanced Diet_]  BALANCED DIET: Should contain       10-15% Protein              (children may need more)      25-30% Fat      60-65% Carbohydrates  [Sidenote: _To Get the Elements Necessary for Health_]  For example, suppose you are a fairly active woman and need 2500 calories per day. Then for a balanced diet you would need:       10% Protein, or               250 C.      25% Fat, or                   625 C.      65% Carbohydrates            1625 C.                                   -------                                   2500 C.         250 C. of P. = 2-1/5 oz. dry protein          (250 ÷ 113 = 2-1/5, approximately)        625 C. of F. = 2-1/2 oz. of fat          (625 ÷ 255 = 2-1/2, approximately)      1625 C. of CH. = 14-1/2 oz. dry carbohydrates         (1625 ÷ 113 = 14-1/2, approximately)  Two and one-fifth ounces dry protein equals the approximate amount of protein in 10 ounces lean meat, fish, or fowl, or 9 ounces cheese, or 9 eggs. (You should not take all of your proteins in any of these single forms.) Two and one-half ounces fat equals approximately 5 pats of butter.  [Sidenote: _If Appetite Not Perverted_]  But listen! You don't have to bother with all this fussy stuff. _Be careful not to over-or under-eat of the proteins_, and your tastes will be a fair standard for the rest. You should remember that a balanced diet contains some of all these foods, in about the proportions given, and that, while _watery vegetables and fruits contain very few calories, they contain very important mineral salts, vitamines, and cellulose._ The latter is good for the daily scrub of the intestinal tract.  [Sidenote: _A Pretty Nearly Universal Error_]  CONSTIPATION is many times caused by a too concentrated diet, or one containing too little roughage. It has also been discovered that some individuals who are troubled with faulty elimination digest this cellulose, and only the more resistant, like bran, is not absorbed. For those, the Japanese seaweed called agaragar in the laboratory, but more familiarly known as agar by the layman, is excellent. The most industrious digestive tract apparently can not digest that. It has the further property of absorbing a large amount of water, thus increasing its bulk.  [Sidenote: _C.S._]  [Sidenote: _Have Enough Water, Else You'll Choke to Death. I Did Once_]  Mineral oils (refined paraffine) also are not absorbable, and they act with benefit in some cases. About the worst thing to do, in general, is to take physics constantly. These are not physics, however; they act mechanically. Even the C.S. (common-sense?) individual can take these. The agar may be taken two or three heaping teaspoonfuls in a large glass of water before retiring, or in the morning before breakfast, or in lieu of 4 o'clock tea. Drink it down rapidly--for goodness' sake, don't try to chew it.  Mineral oil will make fine mayonnaise dressing. It has little or no food value, so the constipated overweight individual may indulge freely. For faulty elimination, then--  1. Correct diet.  2. Exercise--especially brisk walking.  3. Regularity of habit.  4. Possibly the addition of bran, agar, or mineral oils.  5. Sweet disposition. Mean people are always constipated.   _Review_  1.
