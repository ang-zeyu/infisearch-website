I was wondering if I could ever find you in all this crowd, and to have fairly stumbled upon you almost the first thing after leaving the cars is most fortunate.\"  \"Yes; for us as well as you, Annis,\" Mr. Dinsmore said with a smile, offering his hand as he spoke. \"Are you just from Pleasant Plains?\"  \"Yes, sir; we left there this morning, and but a moment since stepped off the train that brought us--nearly all the family of brothers and sisters with their children.\"  \"Why, yes, to be sure, here are Mildred and the doctor and--well, really Charley,\"--shaking hands with Mildred and her husband--\"I will have to be introduced to all these younger folks.\"  There was quite a crowd of them--young, middle-aged, and elderly, for the families had been increasing in numbers, the younger ones growing in size, and all in years.  All wanted to be together for a time, the older ones to be able to talk freely of absent dear ones and other family matters, the younger to make acquaintance with each other.  \"Suppose we take a car in the Ferris Wheel,\" suggested Harold Travilla; \"we can then have a ride, a grand view of the Fair grounds, and a chat, all at one and the same time.\"  Everyone seemed to favor the proposition and without further discussion they all started in that direction.  Arriving at the place they climbed a broad stairway very much like the approach to an Elevated station.  \"This way, ladies and gentleman,\" said a man in a blue coat, pointing to a doorway between two knotted beams, and they passed into a sunshiny room with two rows of chairs at each side. There were windows all about it barred with iron.  \"This is one of the cars,\" remarked Captain Raymond, in answer to an enquiring look from Annis, and he and the other gentlemen of the party busied themselves in seeing the ladies comfortably seated, then took possession of chairs as near them as might be.  Other people were coming in, and in a very few moments the car was in motion, the click of a latch having told that they were locked in.  Some of our party who were trying the wheel for the first time looked a trifle pale and alarmed as the movement began, and one or two of the girls asked low and tremulously if it were certainly quite safe.  \"Yes, I am entirely sure of that,\" replied Harold with his pleasant smile; \"but don't look out of the windows just yet.\"  \"You are not at all frightened, I see,\" said Chester Dinsmore in a low tone to Lulu, having contrived to secure a seat close at her side.  \"Oh, no, indeed!\" she returned. \"This is my second trip and I hardly felt at all timid even the first time, because my father had assured us it was perfectly safe, and I have entire confidence in his opinion and his word.\"  \"I don't know any man whose word or opinion I would be more ready to take,\" returned Chester, giving her a look that seemed to say he would be no less willing to take the captain's daughter, were the opportunity afforded him.  But Lucilla did not notice the look, for she was already gazing out of the window and thinking of nothing but the prospect from it.  \"Oh, look, Chester!\" she said eagerly, \"This gives us such a grand view of the Plaisance. It is the second time our party have made this trip--no, not that--the second time we have been in these cars; we went round twice that day, and I hope will go at least as often to-day. Presently, when we get to the highest part the people down below will look like the merest black dots and the houses like toy ones.\"  \"Yes,\" he returned, \"it is a trip worth taking. I should not have liked to miss it.\"  \"Nor should I,\" said Lucilla. \"I think of asking papa to bring us here several times more.\"  \"In that case I hope I may be permitted to be one of the party every time, for it is a fine sight indeed.\"  \"Are you and Frank new arrivals?\" she asked.  \"Yes, we got into the city last evening. We would have hunted up your party at once, but did not know just where to look for you.\"  \"We are making the yacht our home,\" she returned, \"and it is anchored for the greater part of the time at no great distance from the Peristyle. We spend our nights on it, but so far our days have been passed in visiting different parts of the Fair.\"  \"And you haven't seen everything in it yet?\" he queried laughingly.  \"No, indeed! I heard someone estimate the other day that it would take more than forty years to do that.\"  \"And in a few months the vast majority of the sights will be withdrawn,\" he said with a half sigh; \"so we will have to content ourselves with seeing a few of such things as interest us most. How long will you stay?\"  \"I don't know; that depends upon the decisions of the higher powers; in other words of the older people. How long do you?\"  \"Perhaps two or three weeks. It will depend probably upon how we enjoy ourselves.\"  \"Then you will be likely to stay a good while, I think,\" she returned. \"There! we are at the top of the wheel, and is not the view magnificent?\"  They made the circuit a second time, then seeing that very many people were awaiting an opportunity to fill their places in the car, they vacated them and wandered elsewhere about the Fair grounds for a little.  Then Grandma Elsie expressed a desire to visit the building of her native State--Louisiana--and invited all in the party to go with her and dine there as her guests. All accepted the invitation with apparent pleasure and immediately turned their steps thitherward.  \"Where is it?\" someone asked, and Harold answered: \"At the northern curve of the horseshoe formed by the State sites around the Fine Art Galleries and just west of the Missouri building. It is not a long walk.\"  \"Ah,\" exclaimed Grandma Elsie when they caught sight of their destination, \"see those trees in front laden with moss from our Southern bayous! The sight almost carries one back to the old days at Viamede.\"  \"Yes; that and the foliage generally, which is of the tropical order,\" remarked her father in reply; \"see, the cacti are conspicuous. And I like the simple style of the building with its galleries and verandas.\"  \"And the site is a fine one,\" remarked the captain, \"not far from the cable car entrance and fronting the Art Palace.\"  \"Shall we dine first and then look at the exhibits?\" asked Grandma Elsie. \"I want to give you all a real Southern dinner, hoping it may prove agreeable to your palates.\"  \"I presume we can stand it for once, mother dear,\" returned Herbert, and the rest of the party seemed equally willing.  They passed in and were presently regaling themselves with gumbo soup, opossum, and various other dishes peculiar to the part of the country represented by the building and its appurtenances, being served by cooks and waiters directly from the plantations of the river country.  Then, having satisfied their appetites, they spent some time in examining the relics on exhibit in the building.  One of these was a picture of the Madonna by Raphael. There was also an exhibition of carvings done by women, which excited both admiration and surprise, and in one of the rooms was some richly carved furniture from the State museum at Baton Rouge, which had once belonged to Governor Galvez.  They went next to the Florida building, which was a reproduction of old Fort Marion, whose foundations were laid in 1620, the year of the landing of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts.  The captain mentioned that fact, then asked: \"Do you know, Grace, how long that fort was in building?\"  \"No, papa,\" she replied, \"can you tell us?\"  \"It took one hundred and fifty years of toil by exiles, convicts, and slaves to construct the heavy walls, curtains, bastions, and towers of defence. Its bloodiest days were more than a century before our Civil War, in which it did not take a very prominent part.\"  \"Where are the curtains, papa?\" asked little Elsie. \"I don't see any.\"  \"It is the name given to that part of the rampart which connects the flanks of two bastions,\" replied her father.  \"And it was here that the Apaches were imprisoned,\" remarked Walter.  \"Yes,\" returned his mother, \"and a most gloomy prison it must have proved to them, used as they were to the free life of the mountains, prairies, and forests.\"  Some little time longer was spent in viewing the tropical plants and trees that adorned the exterior of the fort, then they passed inside and examined the many beautiful things to be seen there.  Their next visit was to the headquarters of the State of Washington, where they were much interested in the display of her native woods and the rockery built of native ores, showing pure streaks of gold and silver, so illustrating the mineral wealth of the State.  \"Where next?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore as they passed out.  \"Papa, I'm so tired,\" little Elsie was saying at the same moment, in a low aside to her father.  \"I, too,\" added Ned, overhearing her. \"Please can't we take a ride now?\"  \"Surely,\" said Grandpa Dinsmore, overhearing the request. \"I invite you all to try an electric boat on the lagoon.\"  No one seemed disposed to decline the invitation; some time was spent on the water, then on the Intramural Railway. After that the whole party, at the invitation of Violet and the captain, went aboard the yacht, still lying in the lake at no great distance from the Peristyle, and partook of a supper which was no unpleasant contrast to the enjoyable dinner with which Grandma Elsie had provided them.  The little folks were ready for bed, on leaving the table; the older ones rested for a time on the _Dolphin's_ deck, chatting together while enjoying the sunset, then they returned to the Court of Honor, to revel in its beauties as seen by the witchery of the electric light.     CHAPTER"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14910"],["title","Elsie at the World's Fair (#7)"],["body","I.   Morning found them all rested, refreshed, and eager to spend another day amid the beauties of the Fair. They started early, as on the previous day, found Harold and Herbert with the other young gentlemen friends waiting for them in the Peristyle, spent a little time enjoying its beauties and the never wearying view it afforded of the lake on the one side, and the Court of Honor on the other, then at the earnest solicitation of the little ones they again entered an electric launch and glided swiftly along the quiet waters of the lagoon.  \"Let us go to the Transportation Building,\" proposed Rosie as they landed again. \"I want to see that golden doorway, and have not the least objection to passing through it and examining things inside.\"  \"As no one else has, I presume,\" said her grandfather. \"No doubt we shall find a great deal there worthy of examination.\"  \"Yes, sir; much more than we can attend to in one visit,\" replied Harold, leading the way, as everyone seemed well pleased to carry out Rosie's suggestion.  They had heard and read of the beautiful golden doorway and viewed it with interest and satisfaction.  \"It is very, very beautiful,\" said Grandma Elsie, \"a nest of arches covered with silver and gold.\"  \"And that border is lovely, lovely!\" exclaimed Rosie; \"such delicate tracery!\"  \"Papa, is it solid gold?\" asked little Elsie, who was clinging to her father's hand on one side, while Ned had fast hold of the other.  \"No, daughter,\" the captain replied, \"not solid, though there is a good deal of both gold and silver covering the other and cheaper materials.\" Then he called her attention to a relief on the left side of the arch, showing an ox-cart with its clumsy wheels dragging slowly along through heavy sand, the travellers in it looking most uncomfortable.  \"That, children,\" he said, \"is the way people used to travel years ago when I was a little fellow, such as you are now, Neddie boy; and this\"--going to the other side of the arch and pointing to the contrasting relief--\"shows how we travel now. See, it is a section of a palace-car; some of the people reading, others gazing from its plate-glass windows, and a porter serving them with luncheon.\"  \"Yes, papa; that's the way we travel when we don't go in the _Dolphin_ or in our carriage, and it's a great deal nicer than that ox-cart,\" said Elsie.  \"Oh, papa, there are some words up there!\" exclaimed Ned, pointing up to a higher part of the arch. \"Please read them.\"  \"I will, son,\" replied the captain, \"though I think you are hardly old enough to fully understand them. This\"--pointing it out--\"was written by Macaulay, of whom you will learn more when you are older: 'Of all inventions, the alphabet and the printing-press alone excepted, those inventions which abridge distance have done the most for civilization.' This other is by Lord Bacon: 'There are three things which make a nation great and prosperous: a fertile soil, busy workshops, and easy conveyance for men and goods from place to place.' Those words are put upon this building because in it are shown the different modes of travel in different countries--on the sea also--at different times.\"  They stood for some little time longer examining into the details of that wondrously beautiful doorway, noticing the splendor of the arches and pylon, the stairway on each side, the roof of the pavilion and all the other beauties.  \"It is very beautiful, and a great satisfaction to have seen it,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore at length, \"but perhaps it would be as well for us to go on into the inside of the building now, reserving further examination of this golden doorway for some future time.\"  With that he passed in, the others following.  Many of the exhibits there were more interesting to the older members of the party, especially the gentlemen, than to the ladies and younger people; locomotives and trains of cars such as were in use at different periods of time, showing the vast improvement in their construction since steam was first put to that use, models of vessels teaching the same lesson in regard to increased convenience and comfort of travel upon the water.  \"Oh, there is the _Victoria_--that grandest of battleships, sunk only the other day in collision with her sister ship, the _Camperdown_!\" exclaimed Herbert. \"See what a crowd of men and women are gazing upon it!\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Rosie, \"I remember reading a description of it in the papers. One of England's finest battleships, was she not?\"  \"Yes,\" said Captain Raymond, drawing near and examining the model with interest; \"she was a grand vessel, the pride of the British navy. I should like to have seen her and am glad to have the opportunity to examine even a model. Ah, what a sad accident it was! especially considering that it sent to the bottom of the sea her entire crew of nearly four hundred men and officers.\"  \"Oh, it was dreadful, dreadful!\" said Grace in tearful tones. \"Especially because they had no time to think and prepare for death.\"  \"Yes, that is the saddest part of all,\" sighed Grandma Elsie.  Our friends presently moved on, and all, from Grandpa Dinsmore down to little Ned, found many objects that interested them greatly. But the most attractive thing of all to the young folks--because of the story connected with it--was Grace Darling's boat. It was the captain who pointed it out to his children.  \"Who was she, papa? and what did they put her boat here for?\" asked little Elsie.  \"She was the daughter of William Darling, the lighthouse keeper on Longstone, one of the Fame Islands.\"  \"Where are they, papa?\"  \"In the North Sea, on the coast of Northumberland, the most northern county of England. They form, a group of seventeen islets and rocks, some of them so small and low-lying as to be covered with water and not visible except when the tide is low; and the passage between them is very dangerous in rough weather.  \"Two of the islands have each a lighthouse, and it was in one of those that Grace Darling and her father lived.  \"In 1838 a vessel called the _Forfarshire_ was wrecked among those islands. William Darling, from his lighthouse, saw it lying broken on the rocks, and sixty-three persons on it in danger of drowning. His daughter Grace, a girl of twenty-two, begged him to go and try to rescue them. It was a very dangerous thing to attempt, but he did it, she going with him.  \"Both father and daughter were very strong and skilful, and by exerting themselves to the utmost they succeeded in saving nine of the poor wrecked creatures who were crouching there on the rocks in momentary expectation of being washed off by the raging waves and drowned. They bore them safely to Longstone.\"  \"And that made Grace Darling famous,\" remarked Lulu.  \"Yes,\" said her father. \"Many people, many of the great and wealthy, went to see the brave girl who had thus risked her own life to save others, and they heaped upon her money and valuable presents; so that she was no longer poor. But she did not live long to enjoy the good things bestowed upon her. She died of consumption about four years after her famous adventure.\"  \"What a pity, papa! wasn't it?\"  \"For those who loved her, yes; but not for her, if she was ready for heaven. Do you think it was?\"  \"No, sir, 'cause it is the happy land where Jesus is, and nobody is ever sick or sorry or in pain. But I don't want to go there yet; I'd rather stay a good while longer here with you and mamma.\"  \"I want you to, darling, if such be God's will,\" he returned low and tenderly, bending down to press a fatherly kiss on her round, rosy cheek. \"Your father would hardly know how to do without his little Elsie.\"  She looked up into his face with shining eyes. \"We love each other, don't we, papa?\" she said with satisfaction. \"Mamma too, and brothers and sisters, and grandma, and--oh, all the folks.\"  \"Where now?\" asked Grandma Elsie as they left the Transportation Building.  \"I want to show you the German castle,\" answered Harold. \"It is here on the Midway Plaisance, and is a reproduction of a castle of the middle centuries. It is viewed by most people who have read of moat-surrounded castles with great curiosity and interest.\"  \"There is a German village connected with it, is there not?\" she asked.  \"There is, mamma, and I think you will all enjoy looking at both it and the castle.\"  \"Oh, I am sure we shall if it is a faithful reproduction of the old castles of feudal times that we have read of!\" exclaimed Rosie.  \"It is said to be,\" returned Harold, \"and is considered very curious and interesting.\"  \"Is there a moat about it, Uncle Harold?\" asked Grace.  \"Yes; and a drawbridge and portcullis.\"  \"Oh, what is that?\" asked little Elsie.  \"A framework of timbers crossing each other, pointed on the lower edge with iron and hung by chains in grooves in the chief gateway of the castle, so that on the sudden appearance of an enemy it could be let down to keep him out more quickly than the drawbridge could be raised to prevent his crossing the moat, or the gates shut.\"  \"And what is a moat?\"  \"A ditch or canal. But you shall see one presently, and a portcullis also.\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad we came here to the White City!\" cried Elsie, skipping along by her father's side; \"it's so lovely and there are so many curious things to see.\"  \"Yes, it is a pleasant way of gaining knowledge; pleasanter than learning lessons and reciting them to papa; is it not, daughter?\" asked the captain, smiling down into the bright little face.  \"Yes, sir; but that's not a hard way, either, 'cause my papa is so kind, and loves me and makes the lessons easy.\"  They soon reached the castle, crossed the moat by the drawbridge, passed through the arched gateway, under the portcullis, the young folks, and indeed the older ones also, gazing at it with much curiosity, and entered a spacious hall, the walls of which were hung with bows and ancient weapons, and armor such as was worn by warriors of feudal times.  From the hall was an entrance to a museum,"]]]
