When a fellow is with you, he ought to have half.  It is mean not to give him half.\"  \"If you had done any thing to help stop the horse, I would have shared with you.  But you didn't.\"  \"What of that?\"  Bobby was particularly sensitive in regard to the charge of meanness. His soul was a great deal bigger than his body, and he was always generous, even to his own injury, among his companions.  It was evident to him that Tom had no claim to any part of the reward; but he could not endure the thought even of being accused of meanness.  \"I'll tell you what I will do, if you think I ought to share with you. I will leave it out to Squire Lee; and if he thinks you ought to have half, or any part of the money, I will give it to you.\"  \"No, you don't; you want to get me into a scrape for hooking jack.  I see what you are up to.\"  \"I will state the case to him without telling him who the boys are.\"  \"No, you don't!  You want to be mean about it.  Come, hand over half the money.\"  \"I will not,\" replied Bobby, who, when it became a matter of compulsion, could stand his ground at any peril.  \"How much have you got?\"  \"Thirty-five dollars.\"  \"By jolly!  And you mean to keep it all yourself?\"  \"I mean to give it to my mother.\"  \"No, you won't!  If you are going to be mean about it, I'll smash your head!\"  This was a favorite expression with Tom Spicer, who was a noted bully among the boys of Riverdale.  The young ruffian now placed himself in front of Bobby, and shook his clinched fist in his face.  \"Hand over.\"  \"No, I won't.  You have no claim to any part at the money; at least, I think you have not.  If you have a mind to leave it out to Squire Lee, I will do what is right about it.\"  \"Not I; hand over, or I'll smash your head!\"  \"Smash away,\" replied Bobby, placing himself on the defensive.  \"Do you think you can lick me?\" asked Tom, not a little embarrassed by this exhibition of resolution on the part of his companion.  \"I don't think any thing about it; but you don't bully me in that kind of style.\"  \"Won't I?\"  \"No.\"  But Tom did not immediately put his threat in execution, and Bobby would not be the aggressor; so he stepped one side to pass his assailant.  Tom took this as an evidence of the other's desire to escape, and struck him a heavy blow on the side of the head The next instant the bully was floundering in the soft mud of a ditch; Bobby's reply was more than Tom had bargained for, and while he was dragging himself out of the ditch, our hero ran down to the river, and got his fish pole and basket.  \"You'll catch it for that!\" growled Tom.  \"I'm all ready, whenever it suits your convenience,\" replied Bobby.  \"Just come out here and take it in fair fight,\" continued Tom, who could not help bullying, even in the midst of his misfortune.  \"No, I thank you; I don't want to fight with any fellow.  I will not fight if I can help it.\"  \"What did you hit me for, then?\"  \"In self-defence.\"  \"Just come out here, and try it fair?\"  \"No;\" and Bobby hurried home, leaving the bully astonished, and discomfited by the winding up of the morning's sport.     CHAPTER III.  IN WHICH THE LITTLE BLACK HOUSE IS BOUGHT BUT NOT PAID FOR.  Probably my young readers have by this time come to the conclusion that Bobby Bright was a very clever fellow--one whose acquaintance they would be happy to cultivate.  Perhaps by this time they have become so far interested in him as to desire to know who his parents were, what they did, and in what kind of a house he lived.  I hope none of my young friends will think any less of him when I inform them that Bobby lived in an old black house which had never been painted, which had no flower garden in front of it, and which, in a word, was quite far from being a palace.  A great many very nice city folks would not have considered it fit to live in, would have turned up their noses at it, and wondered that any human beings could be so degraded as to live in such a miserable house.  But the widow Bright, Bobby's mother, thought it was a very comfortable house, and considered herself very fortunate in being able to get so good a dwelling.  She had never lived in a fine house, knew nothing about velvet carpets, mirrors seven feet high, damask chairs and lounges, or any of the smart things which very rich and very proud city people consider absolutely necessary for their comfort.  Her father had been a poor man, her husband had died a poor man, and her own life had been a struggle to keep the demons of poverty and want from invading her humble abode.  Mr. Bright, her deceased husband, had been a day laborer in Riverdale. He never got more than a dollar a day, which was then considered very good wages in the country.  He was a very honest, industrious man, and while he lived, his family did very well.  Mrs. Bright was a careful, prudent woman, and helped him support the family.  They never knew what it was to want for any thing.  Poor people, as well as rich, have an ambition to be something which they are not, or to have something which they have not.  Every person, who has an energy of character, desires to get ahead in the world. Some merchants, who own big ships and big warehouses by the dozen, desire to be what they consider rich.  But their idea of wealth is very grand.  They wish to count it in millions of dollars, in whole blocks of warehouses; and they are even more discontented than the day laborer who has to earn his dinner before he can eat it.  Bobby's father and mother had just such an ambition, only it was so modest that the merchant would have laughed at it.  They wanted to own the little black house in which they resided, so that they could not only be sure of a home while they lived, but have the satisfaction of living in their own house.  This was a very reasonable ideal, compared with that of the rich merchants I have mentioned; but it was even more difficult for them to reach it, for the wages were small, and they had many mouths to feed.  Mr. Bright had saved up fifty dollars; and he thought a great deal more of this sum than many people do of a thousand dollars.  He had had to work very hard and be very prudent in order to accumulate this sum, which made him value it all the more highly.  With this sum of fifty dollars at his command, John Bright felt rich; and then, more than ever before, he wanted to own the little black house.  He felt as grand as a lord; and as soon as the forty-nine dollars had become fifty, he waited upon Mr. Hardhand, a little crusty old man, who owned the little black house, and proposed to purchase it.  The landlord was a hard man.  Every body in Riverdale said he was mean and stingy.  Any generous-hearted man would have been willing to make an easy bargain with an honest, industrious, poor man, like John Bright, who wished to own the house in which he lived; but Mr. Hardhand, although he was rich, only thought how he could make more money.  He asked the poor man four hundred dollars for the old house and the little lot of land on which it stood.  It was a matter of great concern to John Bright.  Four hundred dollars was a \"mint of money,\" and he could not see how he should ever be able to save so much from his daily earnings.  So he talked with Squire Lee about it, who told him that three hundred was all it was worth.  John offered this for it, and after a month's hesitation, Mr. Hardhand accepted the offer, agreeing to take fifty dollars down and the rest in semi-annual payments of twenty-five dollars each, until the whole was paid.  I am thus particular in telling my readers about the bargain, because this debt which his father contracted was the means of making a man of Bobby, as will be seen in his subsequent history.  John Bright paid the first fifty dollars; but before the next instalment became due, the poor man was laid in his cold and silent grave.  A malignant disease carried him off, and the hopes of the Bright family seemed to be blasted.  Four children were left to the widow.  The youngest was only three years old, and Bobby, the oldest, was nine, when his father died. Squire Lee, who had always been a good friend of John Bright, told the widow that she had better go to the poorhouse, and not attempt to struggle along with such a fearful odds against her.  But the widow nobly refused to become a pauper, and to make paupers of her children, whom she loved quite as much as though she and they had been born in a ducal palace.  She told the squire that she had two hands, and as long as she had her health, the town need not trouble itself about her support.  Squire Lee was filled with surprise and admiration at the noble resolution of the poor woman; and when he returned to his house, he immediately sent her a cord of wood, ten bushels of potatoes, two bags of meal, and a firkin of salt pork.  The widow was very grateful for these articles, and no false pride prevented her from accepting the gift of her rich and kind-hearted neighbor.  Riverdale centre was largely engaged in the manufacturing of boots and shoes, and this business gave employment to a large number of men and women.  Mrs. Bright had for several years \"closed\" shoes--which, my readers who do not live in \"shoe towns\" may not know, means sewing or stitching them.  To this business she applied herself with renewed energy.  There was a large hotel in Riverdale centre, where several families from Boston spent the summer.  By the aid of Squire Lee, she obtained the washing of these families, which was more profitable than closing shoes.  By these means she not only supported her family very comfortably, but was able to save a little money towards paying for the house.  Mr. Hardhand, by the persuasions of Squire Lee, had consented to let the widow keep the house, and pay for it as she could.  John "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14762"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright: A Story for Young Folks (#3)"],["body","had been dead four years at the time we introduce Bobby to the reader.  Mrs. Bright had paid another hundred dollars towards the house, with the interest; so there was now but one hundred due.  Bobby had learned to \"close,\" and helped his mother a great deal; but the confinement and the stooping posture did not agree with his health, and his mother was obliged to dispense with his assistance.  But the devoted little fellow found a great many ways of helping her.  He was now thirteen, and was as handy about the house as a girl.  When he was not better occupied, he would often go to the river and catch a mess of fish, which was so much clear gain.  The winter which had just passed, had brought a great deal of sickness to the little black house.  The children all had the measles, and two of them the scarlet fever, so that Mrs. Bright could not work much. Her affairs were not in a very prosperous condition when the spring opened; but the future was bright, and the widow, trusting in Providence, believed that all would end well.  One thing troubled her.  She had not been able to save any thing for Mr. Hardhand.  She could only pay her interest; but she hoped by the first of July to give him twenty-five dollars of the principal.  But the first of July came, and she had only five dollars of the sum she had partly promised her creditor.  She could not so easily recover from the disasters of the hard winter, and she had but just paid off the little debts she had contracted.  She was nervous and uneasy as the day approached.  Mr. Hardhand always abused her when she told him she could not pay him, and she dreaded his coming.  It was the first of July on which Bobby caught those pouts, caught the horse, and on which Tom Spicer had \"caught a Tartar.\"  Bobby hastened home, as we said at the conclusion of the last chapter. He was as happy as a lord.  He had fish enough in his basket for dinner, and for breakfast the next morning, and money enough in his pocket to make his mother as happy as a queen, if queens are always happy.  The widow Bright, though she had worried and fretted night and day about the money which was to be paid to Mr. Hardhand on the first of July, had not told her son any thing about it.  It would only make him unhappy, she reasoned, and it was needless to make the dear boy miserable for nothing; so Bobby ran home all unconscious of the pleasure which was in store for him.  When he reached the front door, as he stopped to scrape his feet on the sharp stone there, as all considerate boys who love their mothers do, before they go into the house, he heard the angry tones of Mr. Hardhand.  He was scolding and abusing his mother because she could not pay him the twenty-five dollars.  Bobby's blood boiled with indignation, and his first impulse was to serve him as he had served Tom Spicer, only a few moments before; but Bobby, as we have before intimated, was a peaceful boy, and not disposed to quarrel with any person; so he contented himself with muttering a few hard words.  \"The wretch!  What business has he to talk to my mother in that style?\" said he to himself.  \"I have a great mind to kick him out of the house.\"  But Bobby's better judgment came to his aid; and perhaps he realized that he and his mother would only get kicked out in return.  He could battle with Mr. Hardhand, but not with the power which his wealth gave him; so, like a great many older persons in similar circumstances, he took counsel of prudence rather than impulse.  \"Bear ye one another's burdens,\" saith the Scripture; but Bobby was not old enough or astute enough to realize that Mr. Hardhand's burden was his wealth, his love of money; that it made him little better than a Hottentot; and he could not feel as charitably towards him as a Christian should towards his erring, weak brother.  Setting his pole by the door, he entered the room where Hardhand was abusing his mother.     CHAPTER IV.  IN WHICH BOBBY GETS OUT OF ONE SCRAPE, AND INTO ANOTHER.  Bobby was so indignant at the conduct of Mr. Hardhand, that he entirely forgot the adventure of the morning; and he did not even think of the gold he had in his pocket.  He loved his mother; he knew how hard she had worked for him and his brother and sisters; that she had burned the \"midnight oil\" at her clamps; and it made him feel very bad to near her abused as Mr. Hardhand was abusing her.  It was not her fault that she had not the money to pay him.  She had been obliged to spend a large portion of her time over the sick beds of her children, so that she could not earn so much money as usual; while the family expenses were necessarily much greater.  Bobby knew also that Mr. Hardhand was aware of all the circumstances of his mother's position, and the more he considered the case the more brutal and inhuman was his course.  As our hero entered the family room with the basket of fish on his arm, the little crusty old man fixed the glance of his evil eye upon him.  \"There is that boy, marm, idling away his time by the river, and eating you out of house and home,\" said the wretch.  \"Why don't you set him to work, and make him earn something?\"  \"Bobby is a very good boy,\" meekly responded the widow Bright.  \"Humph! I should think he was.  A great lazy lubber like him, living on his mother!\" and Mr. Hardhand looked contemptuously at Bobby.  \"I am not a lazy lubber,\" interposed the insulted boy with spirit.  \"Yes, you are.  Why don't you go to work?\"  \"I do work.\"  \"No, you don't; you waste your time paddling in the river.\"  \"I don't.\"  \"You had better teach this boy manners too, marm,\" said the creditor, who, like all men of small souls, was willing to take advantage of the power which the widow's indebtedness gave him.  \"He is saucy.\"  \"I should like to know who taught you manners, Mr. Hardhand,\" replied Bobby, whose indignation was rapidly getting the better of his discretion.  \"What!\" growled Mr. Hardhand, aghast at this unwonted boldness.  \"I heard what you said before I came in; and no decent man would go to the house of a poor woman to insult her.\"  \"Humph!  Mighty fine,\" snarled the little old man, his gray eyes twinkling with malice.  \"Don't Bobby; don't be saucy to the gentleman,\" interposed his mother.  \"Saucy, marm?  You ought to horsewhip him for it.  If you don't, I will.\"  \"No, you won't!\" replied Bobby, shaking his head significantly.  \"I can take care of myself.\"  \"Did any one ever hear such impudence!\" gasped Mr. Hardhand.  \"Don't, Bobby, don't,\" pleaded the anxious mother.  \"I should like to know what right you have to come here and abuse my mother,\" continued Bobby, who could not restrain his anger.  \"Your mother owes me money, and she don't pay it, you young scoundrel!\" answered Mr. Hardhand, foaming with rage.  \"That is no reason why you should insult her.  You can call _me_ what you please, but you shall not insult my mother while I'm round.\"  \"Your mother is a miserable woman, and--\"  \"Say that again, and though you are an old man, I'll hit you for it. I'm big enough to protect my mother, and I'll do it.\"  Bobby doubled up his fists and edged up to Mr. Hardhand, fully determined to execute his threat if he repeated the offensive expression, or any other of a similar import.  He was roused to the highest pitch of anger, and felt as though he had just as lief die as live in defence of his mother's good name.  I am not sure that I could excuse Bobby's violence under any other circumstances.  He loved his mother--as the novelists would say, he idolized her; and Mr. Hardhand had certainly applied some very offensive epithets to her--epithets which no good son could calmly bear applied to a mother.  Besides, Bobby, though his heart was a large one, and was in the right place, had never been educated into those nice distinctions of moral right and wrong which control the judgment of wise and learned men.  He had an idea that violence, resistance with blows, was allowable in certain extreme cases; and he could conceive of no greater provocation than an insult to his mother.  \"Be calm, Bobby; you are in a passion,\" said Mrs. Bright.  \"I am surprised, marm,\" began Mr. Hardhand, who prudently refrained from repeating the offensive language--and I have no doubt he was surprised; for he looked both astonished and alarmed.  \"This boy has a most ungovernable temper.\"  \"Don't you worry about my temper, Mr. Hardhand; I'll take care of myself.  All I want of you is not to insult my mother.  You may say what you like to me; but don't you call her hard names.\"  Mr. Hardhand, like all mean, little men, was a coward; and he was effectually intimidated by the bold and manly conduct of the boy.  He changed his tone and manner at once.  \"You have no money for me, marm?\" said he, edging towards the door.  \"No, sir; I am sorry to say that I have been able to save only five dollars since I paid you last; but I hope--\"  \"Never mind, marm, never mind; I shall not trouble myself to come here again, where I am liable to be kicked by this ill-bred cub.  No, marm, I shall not come again.  Let the law take its course.\"  \"O, mercy!  See what you have brought upon us, Bobby,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bright, bursting into tears.  \"Yes, marm, let the law take its course.\"  \"O Bobby!  Stop a moment, Mr. Hardhand; do stop a moment.\"  \"Not a moment, marm.  We'll see;\" and Mr. Hardhand placed his hand upon the latch string.  Bobby felt very uneasy, and very unhappy at that moment.  His passion had subsided, and he realized that he had done a great deal of mischief by his impetuous conduct.  Then the remembrance of his morning, adventure on the bridge came like a flash of sunshine to his mind, and he eagerly drew from his pocket the handkerchief in which he had deposited the precious gold,--doubly precious now, because it would enable him to retrieve the error into which he had fallen, and do something towards relieving his mother's embarrassment.  With a trembling hand he untied the knot which secured the money.  \"Here"]]]
