He grumbled a little at this unpleasant style of progression, and muttered between his teeth,  \"He's no right to treat me so; I'm as good as he is, any day.\"  When he reached Gertrude's garden, he stood still and looked over the hedge. Dietrich's mother was there, planting her vegetable bed. He sauntered back and forth for awhile, and when he saw her go to the other corner of the garden, he thought he could now get without being seen, into the room where he heard Dietrich whistling at his work. He went round the garden, and was just going in at the back gate, when he came plump against Gertrude. He went by quickly as if he had had no idea of going in; and then hung about watching his chance, but as time did not stand still while he waited, it was bye-and-bye eleven o'clock, and he had to go off to ring the noon bell.  In the afternoon, neighbor Judith was hoeing in her little garden. Blasi stood hesitating in his door-way, and then came out and stood watching her at her work.  \"I am always surprised, Blasi,\" said Judith, looking up from her work, \"to see you in company with a fellow, who steals your money from your pockets, before you know it is there. I would not have anything to do with such a one.\"  \"What? who?\" asked Blasi, fumbling in his empty pockets. \"Who picks my pockets? Who are you talking about? I know I did have some; I wish you would tell me the thief.\"  \"I'll tell no tales,\" said Judith, working away.  \"Bah! tell me, won't you? A fellow can't defend himself unless he knows who is attacking him,\" growled Blasi. \"You might say who you mean.\"  \"Well, I will. Go and take him by the ear. His name is Idleness!\" As Judith spoke, she raised her head, and looked Blasi full in the face; then she bent to her work again.  The lad was angry. He had hoped that he was going to get something back of which he had been robbed, and that Judith would help him as she had been a witness of the theft.  \"Oh, what a fuss you make over a few minutes,\" he said crossly; \"I have to go at four o'clock to ring the bell. I think I ought to take a little from the old man.\"  \"I should say you took more from him than he had. It has just struck half past two; do you know how many minutes there are in an hour and a half?\"  \"There's no getting along with you,\" said Blasi, turning away.  \"Well, you get along finely without me, so go on and prosper,\" said Judith quickly as the lad disappeared.  Blasi had by no means given up his project. He did not see anyone in Gertrude's garden as he passed along. He clambered up on the lattice by the hedge and peeped through the open window into the room. Dietrich's mother was seated near her son; both were working steadily, the young fellow was chattering and laughing gaily, and his mother answered and laughed too, but they did not stop working all the while. Blasi saw plainly that this was not the time to make his request. He would wait until the mother had gone to the kitchen, as she was sure to do bye-and-bye. Four o'clock came and the great business of his day was at hand; it was time to ring the bell, and he had to go. At last when evening came Blasi found his opportunity. He stood watching outside the door, when suddenly Dietrich threw it open, and started off with rapid strides.  Blasi called out, \"Wait, wait a minute, can't you? What's your hurry?\"  Dietrich turned about.  \"What do you want? Tell me quickly. I'm going to meet Veronica; she can't come home alone through the woods after dusk.\"  \"Well, look here,\" said Blasi, breathing hard with his haste, and holding Dietrich by the arm. \"You see, I'm in trouble for want of a few francs or so. Can't you lend them to me? I'll give them back again very soon.\"  \"I haven't that much about me now. Stop a minute--yes, here are two francs and here's a half; will that be enough?\" and throwing the money to Blasi, the young man hastened away.  As evening drew on, Gertrude stood at the end of the garden and looked down the road. She listened to every sound that came from below. She was waiting for her children's voices, for the sound of their footsteps; her children, who made her life, her happiness, her hope! Ah! there they are! that is Dietrich's voice talking eagerly, while Veronica's bell-like laugh sounds clear through the still evening air. With a heart filled to overflowing with happiness, Gertrude went forth to meet them.  As they sat together round the table in their usual cheerful mood, the mother asked for an account of this, Veronica's first day among strangers, and how she liked her new work.  \"Very much indeed, mother,\" was the answer, and the young girl's face beamed with a smile that swept away all trace of the clouds that sometimes marred its beauty.  \"I can't tell you how delightful it is to be able to earn so much. But after all, mother dear, the best part is that I can come home to you at night.\"  \"That's what I think too,\" said Dietrich quickly, and you had but to look in his eyes to see that he spoke the truth.  \"And I am as glad as either of you,\" said Gertrude smiling. \"It has been a long day for me. It seems a great while since you started off this morning, Veronica.\"  \"What! when your only son was sitting by you all day long?\" asked Dietrich playfully.  \"Oh, you know what I mean. I need you both to make me perfectly happy, and cannot spare either of you;\" and she looked from one to the other with caressing glances.  Veronica told them all about the new teacher and the new work, and it was late in the evening before the three separated for the night.     CHAPTER V.  UPON UNSAFE PATHS.   After this evening, Dietrich was scarcely ever able to go on his walk alone. Blasi had always some pretext for joining him, and when Jost found out that regularly every evening his friend took the same walk at the same hour, he too discovered that he had a great deal to tell him, and to consult him about. The two accompanied him through the wood, and when they emerged from it on the other side, they usually saw a graceful figure coming along the white road that led up the hill from Fohrensee. Then without a word on the subject, as by tacit agreement, they stopped, shook hands, and separated; the other two turned back toward the village, and Dietrich went on. They felt instinctively that this was the best thing to do. Dietrich, certainly, found out that his companions were not to Veronica's mind, when one evening, the three being so engaged in talk that they had not noticed that they were later than usual, Veronica came into the wood before they left it, and she recognized Blasi and Jost, although they turned quickly back.  \"They can't have the best of consciences,\" said Veronica, as Dietrich joined her; \"if they had only straight-forward business on hand, why did they take themselves off so hastily, as soon as I came in sight?\"  \"Can't you understand that we may have something to talk about, that we do not wish you to hear?\" asked Dietrich.  The girl was silent a few moments, and then she said, rather seriously,  \"It would suit me far better, if you were not so much in company with those two fellows. Blasi is absolutely idle, and cannot be nice, and Jost is really bad; you can see that in his face. He never dares to look me full in the eye; he always avoids a direct glance, as if he feared that his eyes would betray him. I believe he is thoroughly false.\"  \"No, no, you should not judge him so harshly,\" said Dietrich, good-humoredly. \"He is not what you think him; he is a good friend to me, and has already taught me a great deal that I should never have got at without his help. He is a very clever fellow.\"  Veronica let the matter drop, but it was plain that she had not changed her opinion.  The days grew longer and brighter. The wood was filled with sweeter perfumes evening after evening, as the two friends sauntered along their homeward path, and in each young heart the feeling grew and ripened, that still sweeter and more beautiful days were to come.  One afternoon in May, Veronica paced leisurely along the white hill-road, her eyes fixed on the tall oak on the borders of the wood, which marked the place where the foot-path came out upon the high road. Everything was quiet; not a human being in sight. She reached the spot and looked anxiously into the wood. She listened; she peered between the trees; all was solitude. The tree-tops, softly murmuring, rocked gently to and fro, and through the branches she saw the sunset glow. For the first time, the young girl entered the wood alone. It was quite dark, in there. She passed along with rapid step, among the solemn pines, hastening faster and faster, as the trees seemed to draw together about her. When she came out upon the open pathway, she saw Dietrich coming across the field in hot haste. He was breathless when he reached her.  \"I don't like to have you come alone through the wood, Veronica,\" he said, \"I thought I should be in time, but I could not get rid of those two fellows. I tried to get away two or three times, but they always had something more to say, and kept me.\"  \"Where were you, Dietrich?\"  \"They had some business with me; that is, Jost had something to tell me, and Blasi was there too. Jost did not care to speak of it on the open street, and so we went into the Rehbock; and that is what made me so late. Why, what's the matter, Veronica? Are you ill?\"  She was as pale as a ghost.  \"What! You've been to the Rehbock, Dietrich!\" she exclaimed in evident distress. \"Oh, don't go there! Please don't go to that place again!\"  \"Oh, now we are to have the old story over again, are we?\" said the young man, laughing, \"you have taken some foolish whim into your head; you really don't know why yourself. What's your prejudice against that house in particular?\"  \"I do know why; and it is no whim,\" said Veronica, earnestly. \"I will tell you all about it. That house has been a terror to me ever since I can remember anything. We were both so young that you probably do not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14627"],["title","Veronica (#5)"],["body","it at all. We both went with mother to the doctor's, but you didn't go into the house, I remember now. Mother told the doctor that my father was killed at the Rehbock. I have never forgotten it since. I am constantly seeing him lying dead before my eyes; lying there struck down dead. I often dream about it, and in my dreams I am there--and--and sometimes when I look at his dead form in my dreams, it is not my father any more, but it is you--you, Dietrich, whom they have struck down dead at the Rehbock.\"  Dietrich was going to laugh at these words, but he glanced into Veronica's face and was silent. She was more in earnest than he had thought. He tried to quiet and reassure her, by saying that it was only a dream, and nothing to be afraid of. The dream came naturally enough, because she was always dwelling upon the tragedy of her father's death, and in dreams every one knows that faces are always changing. His explanation, however, did not make much impression upon Veronica. She said no more about it; but not all Dietrich's efforts were sufficient to chase the shadows from her face that evening, although he exerted himself to be even more amusing than usual. Gertrude observed her silence, as they sat about the table, and looked anxiously at her. When they had separated for the night, Dietrich went into his mother's room to have a talk with her. He told her what Veronica had said, and begged her to reason with the young girl and urge her to lay aside these groundless fears which had taken possession of her. He represented to his mother, that of course he sometimes had things to talk over with his companions, and that there surely was no harm in their going to the Rehbock together for their conversations, and he begged her to make Veronica see the whole affair in a reasonable light. Gertrude was shocked to find that the child had heard and understood what she had said to the doctor, and distressed that she had taken it so much to heart. She promised to speak to Veronica, but she also cautioned her son against forming an intimacy with Jost and Blasi. Dietrich cheerfully gave his word; declaring that he was not particularly fond of their company. The mother, however, on further consideration, decided to say nothing on the subject to Veronica, for she thought the whole thing would be the sooner forgotten if not spoken of, and she believed it unwise to stir up the terrors of the past.  The next afternoon, Dietrich left home much earlier than usual, determined not to be belated again, and hoping to escape altogether his too insistent companions. But scarcely had he reached the garden gate when he came upon Blasi, who was lying in wait for him. Dietrich tried to pass him quickly, and to show him that his company was not desired, but in vain Blasi had not been waiting round half an hour to be turned off like that. He explained that he was in worse trouble than ever to-day, and wished to borrow more money than ever before; promising, of course, to pay it back very soon; \"that is, as soon as possible,\" he added.  \"Oh yes, well, when will it be possible, I wonder. How much have you paid me back, as yet, since you began to borrow of me?\" said Dietrich angrily. \"Let me go, Blasi, I've no time to spare.\"  But Blasi went along by his side, and before he had done talking, Jost joined them and held Dietrich fast by the other arm.  \"Come, come,\" he cried, \"I have something to tell you that will make you open your eyes, I guess. I came in a hurry on purpose not to miss you. I've just come from the Rehbock, and I told them to keep the little back room for us, so that we can talk quietly, without danger of being interrupted. Come along, I say.\"  \"I will not,\" said Dietrich, freeing his arm from the other's detaining grasp. \"I haven't time, and I don't believe you have anything special to tell me, either. I must go.\" And Dietrich strode away; but Jost followed him.  \"Don't be such a fool,\" he called out angrily, \"can't you listen when I tell you that I know something decidedly to your advantage. Something that you'll be glad to know. You are running away because of her, and it is something that will be good for her as well as for you. So do stand still, and don't go scampering off as if the gamekeepers were after you!\" But Dietrich did not stop.  \"What do you know about her, or her good?\" he asked furiously. \"Mind your own business and let us alone.\"  As Jost had his own interest in winning the young fellow over, he controlled himself, and said in most soothing tones,  \"Dietrich, I am your friend. Some day you will be very grateful to me. As you are in such a hurry, I will not stop you now; only promise me to come over bye-and-bye for a few minutes to the Rehbock; there's a good fellow, and you will not be sorry. Will you come?\"  \"Well, I've no particular objection to that,\" said Dietrich, and ran off as fast as he could.  Blasi, who had kept pace with the other two, seeing that there was no chance for him now, turned back with Jost, and the two went into the Rehbock together.  Dietrich met Veronica quite the other side of the wood. He did his best to rouse her from her silent mood, and to restore her to better spirits; but he found it impossible to efface the impression she had received the evening before. The painful memory had been too deeply stamped upon her mind, to be easily wiped out.  When the little family had bade each other good-night, after their usual affectionate conversation, Dietrich hesitated about keeping his half-made promise. He did not want to go; yet Jost's words, that the affair touched her as nearly as it did him, had made their intended impression, and though it went sadly against his grain to know that Jost dared even to think about Veronica and her interests at all, still he could not help wondering what it was all about. Suddenly his resolution was taken; he turned about, went down stairs and softly left the house.  Jost was standing in the doorway of the Rehbock, looking out into the night to see if Dietrich was coming. They went at once into the little back room. Blasi was there, sitting behind a big empty bowl; indeed he never sat long behind a full one, for as the bowl was there to be emptied he thought the quicker it was done the better.  \"I'm glad you have come,\" he cried out, \"for we've run quite dry here.\"  Dietrich perceived that he was expected to counteract the dryness; so he ordered some beer, and when this was supplied Jost began in a cautious tone,  \"I have something to say to you, Dietrich, that I don't care for those outside to hear. Blasi can stay, because he is our comrade.\"  \"And because he can be made useful,\" said Dietrich readily, for he knew of old that Jost was in the habit of rushing Blasi forward, where he did not dare to go himself.  \"I don't know about that,\" said Jost, \"but now listen to me. Do you know how a fellow who hasn't so much as a penny in his purse, can in one night get enough to build a big stone house, like the one the landlord of the lion has in Fohrensee, and make himself a gentleman all at once? I know how; I know somebody who has explained it all to me, and I tell you, Dietrich, you have only to say the word, and you can do the same, and give up the whole saddler's business. You can afford to risk something; you're not stupid; and with you it will all go right in a twinkling.\"  \"Do you mean by card-playing?\" asked Dietrich rather contemptuously, for he had made up his mind about that long ago.  \"No indeed, something very different. It is done on paper. You have nothing to do but put some money down, and you can win two or three times as much in no time.\"  \"And lose _four_ times, I suppose?\"  \"There's no losing about it;\" said Jost confidently, \"You're sure to win in the end, if you keep on long enough. It doesn't signify if you do lose a little at first--you can afford to wait.\"  \"I think my trade is surer of winning;\" said Dietrich.  \"Oh yes, sure enough!\" said Jost scornfully. \"It is a pretty sight to see a fellow like you, sitting there year after year on the saddler's bench, scraping all the skin off his hands; and with all the income you have, too! why in ten years you won't have as much as will build you a house such as you want, and it would take ten years more to become a gentleman; and she'd like it a great deal better to have something nice now, and not wait till she is fifty years old.\"  Dietrich was red with anger.  \"What business is it of yours to be forever thinking and talking about her?\" he blazed out. \"You have no concern with her whatever; just keep yourself to what you're fit for.\"  \"Why do go on as you do?\" asked Jost with a knowing wink. \"Do you suppose it never enters anybody's head to ask why you keep on working and delving as if you liked it? Can't we guess who you're doing it all for?\"  \"And it's not at all out of the way to be thinking about her, either,\" interposed Blasi, \"there's another ready enough to do that if there were any chance for him,\" and he winked significantly at Jost. Jost took no notice of the insinuation, but went on, addressing himself to Dietrich.  \"There's no danger for you in this plan. We will share losses and gains alike, and if we do not like it we can leave off when ever we choose. But I don't see why we shouldn't like it, when we can earn so much with so little trouble, and without working from morning till night. There goes somebody now, who has all he wants, I should like to be in his place!\"  A wagon was rattling by as he spoke, and its occupant was urging the galloping horse faster and faster along the road.  \"That's the doctor,\" said Dietrich, looking out; \"he has had to work hard enough and is still at it. He must be going to visit a very sick patient; he would not be driving at that rate for anything else. It is late for the old gentleman to be out.\"  \"Work!\" said Jost, \"well, I speak for that kind of work; sitting in a chaise behind a horse. It's another part of speech to have to work with"]]]
