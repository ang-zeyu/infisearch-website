Did she run after it?\"  \"No, that was not the way. Puss was hid on a big box. The rat stole out, and she jumped at it and caught it.\"  \"Poor rat! It must have been very hungry; it came out to get something to eat.\"  \"Why, Hattie, you are not sorry puss got the rat, are you?\"  \"No, I can not say I am sorry she got it; but I do not like to see even a rat suffer pain.\"    LESSON LIII.  roll       build    grand'pa    hard     foam       ships  hous'es    long     sail        break    wood'en    blow   [Illustration: Two girls play in sand. Man with cane and top hat is seated on beach.]   Mary and Lucy have come down to the beach with their grandpa. They live in a town near the sea.  Their grandpa likes to sit on the large rock, and watch the big ships as they sail far away on the blue sea. Sometimes he sits there all day long.  The little girls like to dig in the sand, and pick up pretty shells. They watch the waves as they roll up on the beach, and break into white foam.  They sometimes make little houses of sand, and build walls around them; and they dig wells with their small wooden spades.  They have been picking up shells for their little sister. She is too young to come to the beach.  I think all children like to play by the seaside when the sun is bright, and the wind does not blow too hard.

He thought these would be nice pets for Willie; so he asked the lad how much he wanted for his rabbits.  The boy said, \"Only fifty cents, sir.\"  Willie's father bought them, and carried them home.  Here you see the rabbits and their little master. He has a pen for them, and always shuts them in it at night to keep them safe.  He gives them bread and grass to eat. They like grass, and will take it from his hand. He has called in a little friend to see them.  Willie is telling him about their funny ways.  SLATE WORK.

The old bird must have worked hard to find all the hairs, and make them into such a pretty, round nest.\"  \"Shall we take the nest, Rose?\"  \"Oh no, Willie! We must not take it; but we will come and look at it again, some time.\"   SLATE WORK.

There! I just saw the old bird fly out of the bush. Stand here, Rose. Can you see?\"  \"Why, Willie, what ugly little things! What big mouths they have, and no feathers!\"  \"Keep still, Rose. Here comes the old bird with a worm in her bill.

Frank was a poor, little, lame boy. His father and mother were dead. His dear, old grandma took care of him, and tried to make him happy.  Every day, Mary's mother filled Frank's basket with bread and meat, and a little tea for his grandma.  \"How do you do, Frank?\" said Mary. \"Don't make a noise; my doll is going to sleep. It is just a little sick to-day.\"  \"Well, then, let us whistle it to sleep.\" And Frank, taking a willow whistle out of his pocket, blew a long note.  \"Oh, how sweet!\" cried Mary. \"Do let me try.\"    LESSON LX.  turned    face    cried    low    al'most    soon    more    cry  once(wuns)        be cause'   [Illustration: Boy and Girl sitting on log.]   \"Yes, Mary, I will give it to you, because you are so good to my grandma.\"  \"Oh! thank you very much.\" Mary blew and blew a long time. \"I can't make it whistle,\" said she, almost ready to cry.  \"Sometimes they will whistle, and sometimes they won't,\" said Frank. \"Try again, Mary.\"  She tried once more, and the whistle made a low, sweet sound. \"It whistles!\" she cried.  In her joy, she had turned the doll's face down, and its eyes shut tight, as if it had gone to sleep.  \"There!\" cried Frank, \"I told you the way to put a doll to sleep, is to whistle to it.\"  \"So it is,\" said Mary. \"Dear, little thing; it must be put in its bed now.\"  So they went into the house. Frank's basket was soon filled, and he went home happy.

They were very small, and the old hen took good care of them. She found food for them in the daytime, and at night kept them under her wings.  One day, this old hen took her chickens down to a small brook. She thought the air from the water would do them good.  When they got to the brook, they walked on the bank a little while. It was very pretty on the other side of the brook, and the old hen thought she would take her children over there.  There was a large stone in the brook: she thought it would be easy for them to jump to that stone, and from it to the other side.  So she jumped to the stone, and told the children to come after her. For the first time, she found that they would not obey her.  She flapped her wings, and cried, \"Come here, all of you! Jump upon this stone, as I did. We can then jump to the other side. Come now!\"  \"O mother! we can't, we can't, we can't!\" said all the little chickens.  \"Yes you can, if you try,\" said the old hen. \"Just flap your wings, as I did, and you can jump over.\"  \"I am flapping my wings,\" said Chippy, who stood by himself; \"but I can't jump any better than I could before.\"    LESSON LXII.  chirped    nev'er     in deed'    slow'ly    re'ally    brood  be gan'    did n't    use         door       bite       piece   [Illustration: Hen with chicks.]   \"I never saw such children,\" said the old hen. \"You don't try at all.\"  \"We can't jump so far, mother. Indeed we can't, we can't!\" chirped the little chickens.  \"Well,\" said the old hen, \"I must give it up.\" So she jumped back to the bank, and walked slowly home with her brood.  \"I think mother asked too much of us,\" said one little chicken to the others.  \"Well, I tried,\" said Chippy.  \"We didn't,\" said the others; \"it was of no use to try.\"  When they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to eat. She soon found, near the back door, a piece of bread.  So she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one trying to get a bite at the piece of bread.  \"No, no!\" said the old hen. \"This bread is for Chippy. He is the only one of my children that really tried to jump to the stone.\"    LESSON LXIII.  last    slates    write     waste     neat     taken  clean   learn     read'er   par'ents  sec'ond   [Illustration: Teacher with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14640"],["title","McGuffey's First Eclectic Reader, Revised Edition (#4)"],["body","students in classroom.]   We have come to the last lesson in this book. We have finished the First Reader.  You can now read all the lessons in it, and can write them on your slates.  Have you taken good care of your book? Children should always keep their books neat and clean.  Are you not glad to be ready for a new book?  Your parents are very kind to send you to school. If you are good, and if you try to learn, your teacher will love you, and you will please your parents.  Be kind to all, and do not waste your time in school. When you go home, you may ask your parents to get you a Second Reader.    PHONIC CHART.
