Attention, the following position is assumed:     1. HEELS TOGETHER AND ON A LINE.--If the heels are not on a line, the hips and sometimes even the shoulders, are thrown out of line.    2. FEET TURNED OUT EQUALLY, FORMING AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES.--If the feet are not turned out equally, the result will be the same as above.    3. KNEES EXTENDED WITHOUT STIFFNESS.--Muscles should be contracted just enough to keep the knees straight. If locked, men tire easily and faint if at attention a long time.    4. THE TRUNK ERECT UPON THE HIPS, the spine extended throughout its entire length; the buttocks well forward.    The position of the trunk, spine and buttocks is most essential. In extending the spine the men must feel that the trunk is being _stretched up_ from the waist until the back is as straight as it can be made.    In stretching the spine the _chest_ should be _arched_ and raised, _without_, however, _raising the shoulders or interfering with natural respiration_.    5. SHOULDERS FALLING NATURALLY and moved back until they are square.    Being square, means having the shoulder ridge and the point of the shoulder at right angles to a general anterior-posterior plane running through the body. They should never be forced back of this plane, but out rather in line with it.    6. ARMS HANGING NATURALLY, thumbs against the seams of the trousers, fingers extended, and back of hand turned out.    The arms must not be forcibly extended nor held rigidly; if they are, a compensating faulty curve will occur in the lumbar region.    7. HEAD ERECT, CHIN RAISED until neck is vertical, eyes fixed upon some object at their own height.    Every tendency to draw the chin in must be counteracted.    8. When this position is correctly assumed, the men will be taught to _incline the body forward_ until the weight rests chiefly upon the balls of the feet, heels resting lightly upon the ground.    When properly assumed, a vertical line drawn from the top of the head should pass in front of the ear, shoulder and thighs, and find its base at the balls of the feet.    Every tendency toward rigidity _must be avoided_; all muscles are contracted only enough to maintain this position, which is one of co-ordination, of _physical and mental alertness_, that makes for mobility, activity and grace. A man who faints standing at attention has not taken the proper position.   Rests.  POSITION OF REST AND AT EASE.--When men are standing _at rest_ or _at ease_ they must be cautioned to avoid assuming any position that will nullify the object of the position of Attention. Standing on one leg, folding arms, allowing shoulders or head to droop forward, must be discountenanced persistently until the men form the habit of resting with feet separated but on the same line, hands elapsed behind the back,--head, shoulders and trunk erect, (m.p.t., pp. 21 and 22.)     FALL OUT.--Leave ranks.    REST.--One foot in place. Can talk.    AT EASE.--One foot in place. Silence.    PARADE REST.--Do not slouch down on right foot. Keep chest well up.    EYES RIGHT, 2. FRONT.--Have it snappy.    RIGHT FACE.--To face _in marching_ and advance, turn on the ball of either foot and step off with the other foot in the new line of direction. (Do not confuse with the ordinary command, \"Right Face.\")    RIGHT HALF FACE.--45 degrees, used to show position in Right Oblique.    ABOUT FACE.--Have weight well back. Not necessary to move right foot after turn is made.    HAND SALUTE.--Manner of rendering is index to manner in which all other duties are performed.    FORWARD MARCH.--Shift weight to right foot, _mentally_.    DOUBLE TIME, MARCH.--Tendency to go too fast. Time it. 30 steps in 10 seconds. Take one step quick time, then take up double time.    MARK TIME, MARCH.--Given as either foot strikes the ground. To resume full step, _Forward, March._    HALF STEP, MARCH.--All steps and marchings executed from a halt, except Right Step, begin with left foot.    RIGHT STEP, MARCH. BACKWARD, MARCH.--Executed in quick time only and at trail, without command. 15 inch Step.    SQUAD, HALT.--Given as either foot strikes the ground.    BY THE RIGHT FLANK, MARCH.--Step off with right foot.    TO THE REAR, MARCH.--Given as right foot strikes the ground. If marching in double time, turn to the rightabout taking 4 steps, in place, in cadence, and step off with left foot.    CHANGE STEP, MARCH.--Being in march; given as either foot strikes the ground.   Manual of Arms.  PURPOSE.--To make the man so accustomed to the rifle that he handles it without a thought.  Eight rules govern the carrying of the piece. See paragraph 75, Infantry Drill Regulations.  Six rules govern the execution of the manual. See paragraph 76, Infantry Drill Regulations.   Commands and Cautions.  ORDER, ARMS.--See that all the fingers of the right hand are around the piece.  PRESENT, ARMS.--Left forearm horizontal and against the body.

UNFIX BAYONET.--Parade Rest and resume order after bayonet is unfixed.  INSPECTION ARMS.--Be sure men glance down in chamber and keep hold of bolt handle.  Parade, Rest can be executed only from order arms, and the command Attention follows Parade, Rest.  Any movement not in the manual, _e.g._, Right, Face, breaks the execution of movements by the numbers. The number of counts in the execution of each command must be remembered.  Distinguish between _raise_ and _carry_ and _throw_.   School of the Squad.  OBJECT.--To give basic element, the squad, its first lesson in team work.  Team work wins battles just as it does football games.  Avoid keeping men too long at the same movement.  COMPOSITION OF SQUAD.--7 men and a corporal. Never less than 6 nor more than 11 men.

Deploying as skirmishers and following the corporal are covered under Company Extended Order.   School of the Company.  The company is the basic fighting and administrative unit, and must be easily handled and capable of promptly carrying out the will of its commander.

Close order drill is for discipline.  Numerical designations of squads or platoons do not change.  Center squad is middle or right middle squad of the company.    8 (6-11) men      = 1 squad.   7 (2-7) squads    = 1 platoon.   4 platoons        = 1 company (250 men, 6 officers).   4 (2-6) companies = 1 battalion (1,026 officers and men).   3 battalions      = 1 regiment (3,755, including medical detachment).   2 regiments       = 1 brigade (8,210 officers and men).   2 brigades        = 1 division (27,152 officers and men).  First Sergeant when not commanding a platoon is opposite the 3rd file from outer flank of first platoon, in line of file closers.  FALL IN.--First Sergeant 6 paces front of center, facing company. Right guide takes post at such point that the center will be 6 paces from and opposite the First Sergeant.  Squad leaders salute and report all present; or Private(s) ---- absent. First Sergeant does not return salute of squad leaders.  Captain takes post 12 paces in front of center of company in time to receive report of First Sergeant, \"Sir, all present or accounted for,\" or names of unauthorized absentees. E.G. A man in hospital might be reported absent by squad leader if he did not know where he was, but First Sergeant would know, and would not report him absent.  Captain returns salute of First Sergeant who then takes his post _without command_.   PLATOON MOVEMENTS IN PLATOON COLUMN.  _Leading Platoon, C.O._  On Right into Line       ... Right Turn.
