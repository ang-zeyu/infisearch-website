All were alarmed, and \"rush of blood, strangulation\" were the conjectures, but the doctor, when asked the cause, grimly told them it was a Negro child. There was a family conclave, the coachman heard of it and leaving his own family went West, and has never returned. As soon as Mrs. Marshall was able to travel she was sent away in deep disgrace. Her husband died within the year of a broken heart.  Ebenzer Fowler, the wealthiest colored man in Issaquena County, Miss., was shot down on the street in Mayersville, January 30, 1885, just before dark by an armed body of white men who filled his body with bullets. They charged him with writing a note to a white woman of the place, which they intercepted and which proved there was an intimacy existing between them.  Hundreds of such cases might be cited, but enough have been given to prove the assertion that there are white women in the South who love the Afro-American's company even as there are white men notorious for their preference for Afro-American women.  There is hardly a town in the South which has not an instance of the kind which is well known, and hence the assertion is reiterated that \"nobody in the South believes the old thread bare lie that negro men rape white women.\" Hence there is a growing demand among Afro-Americans that the guilt or innocence of parties accused of rape be fully established. They know the men of the section of the country who refuse this are not so desirous of punishing rapists as they pretend. The utterances of the leading white men show that with them it is not the crime but the _class_. Bishop Fitzgerald has become apologist for lynchers of the rapists of _white_ women only. Governor Tillman, of South Carolina, in the month of June, standing under the tree in Barnwell, S.C., on which eight Afro-Americans were hung last year, declared that he would lead a mob to lynch a _negro_ who raped a _white_ woman. So say the pulpits, officials and newspapers of the South. But when the victim is a colored woman it is different.  Last winter in Baltimore, Md., three white ruffians assaulted a Miss Camphor, a young Afro-American girl, while out walking with a young man of her own race. They held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed dastardly enough to arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape as excuse for lawlessness, but she was an Afro-American. The case went to the courts, an Afro-American lawyer defended the men and they were acquitted.  In Nashville, Tenn., there is a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged a little Afro-American girl, and, from the physical injuries received, she has been ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is now a detective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man outraged an Afro-American girl in a drug store. He was arrested, and released on bail at the trial. It was rumored that five hundred Afro-Americans had organized to lynch him. Two hundred and fifty white citizens armed themselves with Winchesters and guarded him. A cannon was placed in front of his home, and the Buchanan Rifles (State Militia) ordered to the scene for his protection. The Afro-American mob did not materialize. Only two weeks before Eph. Grizzard, who had only been _charged_ with rape upon a white woman, had been taken from the jail, with Governor Buchanan and the police and militia standing by, dragged through the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged into him at every step, and with every fiendish cruelty a frenzied mob could devise, he was at last swung out on the bridge with hands cut to pieces as he tried to climb up the stanchions. A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth-century civilization of the Athens of the South! No cannon or military was called out in his defense. He dared to visit a white woman.  At the very moment these civilized whites were announcing their determination \"to protect their wives and daughters,\" by murdering Grizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old Maggie Reese, an Afro-American girl. He was not harmed. The \"honor\" of grown women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and Ed Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were white. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this case; she was black.  A white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months ago inflicted such injuries upon another Afro-American child that she died. He was not punished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to lynch an Afro-American who visited a white woman.  In Memphis, Tenn., in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the husband of Russell Hancock's widow, was arrested for attempted rape on Mattie Cole, a neighbors cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing his purpose, by the appearance of Mattie's employer. Dorr's friends say he was drunk and not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to indict him and he was discharged.     3 _The_ NEW CRY   The appeal of Southern whites to Northern sympathy and sanction, the adroit, insiduous plea made by Bishop Fitzgerald for suspension of judgment because those \"who condemn lynching express no sympathy for the _white_ woman in the case,\" falls to the ground in the light of the foregoing.  From this exposition of the race issue in lynch law, the whole matter is explained by the well-known opposition growing out of slavery to the progress of the race. This is crystalized in the oft-repeated slogan: \"This is a white man's country and the white man must rule.\" The South resented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the Civil Rights Law. The raids of the Ku-Klux and White Liners to subvert reconstruction government, the Hamburg and Ellerton, S.C., the Copiah County, Miss., and the Layfayette Parish, La., massacres were excused as the natural resentment of intelligence against government by ignorance.  Honest white men practically conceded the necessity of intelligence murdering ignorance to correct the mistake of the general government, and the race was left to the tender mercies of the solid South. Thoughtful Afro-Americans with the strong arm of the government withdrawn and with the hope to stop such wholesale massacres urged the race to sacrifice its political rights for sake of peace. They honestly believed the race should fit itself for government, and when that should be done, the objection to race participation in politics would be removed.  But the sacrifice did not remove the trouble, nor move the South to justice. One by one the Southern States have legally(?) disfranchised the Afro-American, and since the repeal of the Civil Rights Bill nearly every Southern State has passed separate car laws with a penalty against their infringement. The race regardless of advancement is penned into filthy, stifling partitions cut off from smoking cars. All this while, although the political cause has been removed, the butcheries of black men at Barnwell, S.C., Carrolton, Miss., Waycross, Ga., and Memphis, Tenn., have gone on; also the flaying alive of a man in Kentucky, the burning of one in Arkansas, the hanging of a fifteen-year-old girl in Louisiana, a woman in Jackson, Tenn., and one in Hollendale, Miss., until the dark and bloody record of the South shows 728 Afro-Americans lynched during the past eight years. Not fifty of these were for political causes; the rest were for all manner of accusations from that of rape of white women, to the case of the boy Will Lewis who was hanged at Tullahoma, Tenn., last year for being drunk and \"sassy\" to white folks.  These statistics compiled by the _Chicago Tribune_ were given the first of this year (1892). Since then, not less than one hundred and fifty have been known to have met violent death at the hands of cruel bloodthirsty mobs during the past nine months.  To palliate this record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes intelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained the history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the plausible screen of defending the honor of its women. This, too, in the face of the fact that only _one-third_ of the 728 victims to mobs have been _charged_ with rape, to say nothing of those of that one-third who were innocent of the charge. A white correspondent of the _Baltimore Sun_ declares that the Afro-American who was lynched in Chestertown, Md., in May for assault on a white girl was innocent; that the deed was done by a white man who had since disappeared. The girl herself maintained that her assailant was a white man. When that poor Afro-American was murdered, the whites excused their refusal of a trial on the ground that they wished to spare the white girl the mortification of having to testify in court.  This cry has had its effect. It has closed the heart, stifled the conscience, warped the judgment and hushed the voice of press and pulpit on the subject of lynch law throughout this \"land of liberty.\" Men who stand high in the esteem of the public for Christian character, for moral and physical courage, for devotion to the principles of equal and exact justice to all, and for great sagacity, stand as cowards who fear to open their mouths before this great outrage. They do not see that by their tacit encouragement, their silent acquiescence, the black shadow of lawlessness in the form of lynch law is spreading its wings over the whole country.  Men who, like Governor Tillman, start the ball of lynch law rolling for a certain crime, are powerless to stop it when drunken or criminal white toughs feel like hanging an Afro-American on any pretext.  Even to the better class of Afro-Americans the crime of rape is so revolting they have too often taken the white man's word and given lynch law neither the investigation nor condemnation it deserved.  They forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain crime,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14975"],["title","Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (#3)"],["body"," only concedes the right to lynch any person for any crime, but (so frequently is the cry of rape now raised) it is in a fair way to stamp us a race of rapists and desperadoes. They have gone on hoping and believing that general education and financial strength would solve the difficulty, and are devoting their energies to the accumulation of both.  The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American. It has left the out-of-the-way places where ignorance prevails, has thrown off the mask and with this new cry stalks in broad daylight in large cities, the centers of civilization, and is encouraged by the \"leading citizens\" and the press.     4 _The_ MALICIOUS _and_ UNTRUTHFUL WHITE PRESS   The _Daily Commercial_ and _Evening Scimitar_ of Memphis, Tenn., are owned by leading business men of that city, and yet, in spite of the fact that there had been no white woman in Memphis outraged by an Afro-American, and that Memphis possessed a thrifty law-abiding, property-owning class of Afro-Americans the _Commercial_ of May 17, under the head of \"More Rapes, More Lynchings\" gave utterance to the following:    The lynching of three Negro scoundrels reported in our dispatches from   Anniston, Ala., for a brutal outrage committed upon a white woman will   be a text for much comment on \"Southern barbarism\" by Northern   newspapers; but we fancy it will hardly prove effective for campaign   purposes among intelligent people. The frequency of these lynchings   calls attention to the frequency of the crimes which causes lynching.   The \"Southern barbarism\" which deserves the serious attention of all   people North and South, is the barbarism which preys upon weak and   defenseless women. Nothing but the most prompt, speedy and extreme   punishment can hold in check the horrible and beastial propensities of   the Negro race. There is a strange similarity about a number of cases of   this character which have lately occurred.    In each case the crime was deliberately planned and perpetrated by   several Negroes. They watched for an opportunity when the women were   left without a protector. It was not a sudden yielding to a fit of   passion, but the consummation of a devilish purpose which has been   seeking and waiting for the opportunity. This feature of the crime not   only makes it the most fiendishly brutal, but it adds to the terror of   the situation in the thinly settled country communities. No man can   leave his family at night without the dread that some roving Negro   ruffian is watching and waiting for this opportunity. The swift   punishment which invariably follows these horrible crimes doubtless acts   as a deterring effect upon the Negroes in that immediate neighborhood   for a short time. But the lesson is not widely learned nor long   remembered. Then such crimes, equally atrocious, have happened in quick   succession, one in Tennessee, one in Arkansas, and one in Alabama. The   facts of the crime appear to appeal more to the Negro's lustful   imagination than the facts of the punishment do to his fears. He sets   aside all fear of death in any form when opportunity is found for the   gratification of his bestial desires.    There is small reason to hope for any change for the better. The   commission of this crime grows more frequent every year. The generation   of Negroes which have grown up since the war have lost in large measure   the traditional and wholesome awe of the white race which kept the   Negroes in subjection, even when their masters were in the army, and   their families left unprotected except by the slaves themselves. There   is no longer a restraint upon the brute passion of the Negro.    What is to be done? The crime of rape is always horrible, but the   Southern man there is nothing which so fills the soul with horror,   loathing and fury as the outraging of a white woman by a Negro. It is   the race question in the ugliest, vilest, most dangerous aspect. The   Negro as a political factor can be controlled. But neither laws nor   lynchings can subdue his lusts. Sooner or later it will force a crisis.   We do not know in what form it will come.  In its issue of June 4, the _Memphis Evening Scimitar_ gives the following excuse for lynch law:    Aside from the violation of white women by Negroes, which is the   outcropping of a bestial perversion of instinct, the chief cause of   trouble between the races in the South is the Negro's lack of manners.   In the state of slavery he learned politeness from association with   white people, who took pains to teach him. Since the emancipation came   and the tie of mutual interest and regard between master and servant was   broken, the Negro has drifted away into a state which is neither freedom   nor bondage. Lacking the proper inspiration of the one and the   restraining force of the other he has taken up the idea that boorish   insolence is independence, and the exercise of a decent degree of   breeding toward white people is identical with servile submission. In   consequence of the prevalence of this notion there are many Negroes who   use every opportunity to make themselves offensive, particularly when   they think it can be done with impunity.    We have had too many instances right here in Memphis to doubt this, and   our experience is not exceptional. _The white people won't stand this   sort of thing, and whether they be insulted as individuals are as a   race, the response will be prompt and effectual._ The bloody riot of   1866, in which so many Negroes perished, was brought on principally by   the outrageous conduct of the blacks toward the whites on the streets.   It is also a remarkable and discouraging fact that the majority of such   scoundrels are Negroes who have received educational advantages at the   hands of the white taxpayers. They have got just enough of learning to   make them realize how hopelessly their race is behind the other in   everything that makes a great people, and they attempt to \"get even\" by   insolence, which is ever the resentment of inferiors. There are   well-bred Negroes among us, and it is truly unfortunate that they should   have to pay, even in part, the penalty of the offenses committed by the   baser sort, but this is the way of the world. The innocent must suffer   for the guilty. If the Negroes as a people possessed a hundredth part of   the self-respect which is evidenced by the courteous bearing of some   that the _Scimitar_ could name, the friction between the races would be   reduced to a minimum. It will not do to beg the question by pleading   that many white men are also stirring up strife. The Caucasian   blackguard simply obeys the promptings of a depraved disposition, and he   is seldom deliberately rough or offensive toward strangers or   unprotected women.    The Negro tough, on the contrary, is given to just that kind of   offending, and he almost invariably singles out white people as his   victims.  On March 9, 1892, there were lynched in this same city three of the best specimens of young since-the-war Afro-American manhood. They were peaceful, law-abiding citizens and energetic business men.  They believed the problem was to be solved by eschewing politics and putting money in the purse. They owned a flourishing grocery business in a thickly populated suburb of Memphis, and a white man named Barrett had one on the opposite corner. After a personal difficulty which Barrett sought by going into the \"People's Grocery\" drawing a pistol and was thrashed by Calvin McDowell, he (Barrett) threatened to \"clean them out.\" These men were a mile beyond the city limits and police protection; hearing that Barrett's crowd was coming to attack them Saturday night, they mustered forces, and prepared to defend themselves against the attack.  When Barrett came he led a _posse_ of officers, twelve in number, who afterward claimed to be hunting a man for whom they had a warrant. That twelve men in citizen's clothes should think it necessary to go in the night to hunt one man who had never before been arrested, or made any record as a criminal has never been explained. When they entered the back door the young men thought the threatened attack was on, and fired into them. Three of the officers were wounded, and when the _defending_ party found it was officers of the law upon whom they had fired, they ceased and got away.  Thirty-one men were arrested and thrown in jail as \"conspirators,\" although they all declared more than once they did not know they were firing on officers. Excitement was at fever beat until the morning papers, two days after, announced that the wounded deputy sheriffs were out of danger. This hindered rather than helped the plans of the whites. There was no law on the statute books which would execute an Afro-American for wounding a white man, but the \"unwritten law\" did. Three of these men, the president, the manager and clerk of the grocery--\"the leaders of the conspiracy\"--were secretly taken from jail and lynched in a shockingly brutal manner. \"The Negroes are getting too independent,\" they say, \"we must teach them a lesson.\"  What lesson? The lesson of subordination. \"Kill the leaders and it will cow the Negro who dares to shoot a white man, even in self-defense.\"  Although the race was wild over the outrage, the mockery of law and justice which disarmed men and locked them up in jails where they could be easily and safely reached by the mob--- the Afro-American ministers, newspapers and leaders counselled obedience to the law which did not protect them.  Their counsel was heeded and not a hand was uplifted to resent the outrage; following the advice of the _Free Speech_, people left the city in great numbers.  The dailies and associated press reports heralded these men to the country as \"toughs,\" and \"Negro desperadoes who kept a low dive.\" This same press service printed that the Negro who was lynched at Indianola, Miss., in May, had outraged"]]]
