ELSIE'S CHILDREN  A SEQUEL TO \"ELSIE'S MOTHERHOOD\"   By MARTHA FINLEY  Complete Authorized Edition  Published by arrangement with Dodd, Mead and Company   A.L. BURT COMPANY  PUBLISHERS New York Chicago     DODD, MEAD & COMPANY.  1877  1905, BY DODD, MEAD & COMPANY.      Preface.   With this volume, bringing the Story of Elsie and her Children down to the present time, the series closes.  It was not by request of the author's _personal_ friends, that either this or any one of the previous volumes was written, but in acquiescence with the demands of the Public--the friends and admirers of Elsie herself; and we know that as child, as young girl, as wife and mother, she has had many friends who have been loath to part with her. May they find neither her nor her children less lovable in this, than in the earlier volumes, and may their society prove sweet, comforting and helpful to many readers and friends both old and new.  M.F.     Elsie's Children.     CHAPTER FIRST.      \"Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth,      What joy is welcom'd like a new-born child.\"                                      --MRS. NORTON.    A merry scene in the nursery at Viamede, where the little Travillas are waiting for their morning half hour with \"dear mamma.\" Mammy coming in smiling and mysterious, her white apron thrown over something held carefully in her arms, bids the children guess what it is.  \"A new dolly for me?\" says Vi; \"I'm going to have a birthday to-morrow.\"  \"A kite,\" ventured Harold. \"No, a balloon.\"  \"A tite! a tite!\" cried little Herbert, clapping his hands.  \"Pshaw! it's nothing but a bundle of clothes mammy's been doing up for one of you girls,\" said Eddie. \"I see a bit of lace or work, or something, hanging down below her apron.\"  \"Is it a new dress for Vi, mammy?\" asked Elsie, putting her arm about her sister and giving her a loving kiss.  \"Yah, yah; you ain't no whar nigh it yet, chillens,\" laughed mammy, dropping into a chair, and warding off an attempt on the part of little Herbert to seize her prize and examine it for himself.  \"Oh, it's alive,\" cried Harold, half breathlessly, \"I saw it move!\" Then as a slight sound followed the movement, \"A baby! a baby!\" they all exclaim, \"O, mammy, whose is it? where did you get it? oh, sit down and show it to us!\"  \"Why, chillen, I reckon it 'longs to us,\" returned mammy, complying with the request, while they gathered closely about her with eager and delighted faces.  \"Ours, mammy? Then I'm glad it isn't black or yellow like the babies down at the quarter,\" said Harold, eying it with curiosity and interest.  \"So am I too,\" remarked Violet, \"but it's got such a red face and hardly any hair on the top of its head.\"  \"Well, don't you remember that's the way Herbie looked when he first came?\" said Eddie.  \"And he grew very white in a few weeks,\" remarked Elsie. \"But is it mamma's baby, mammy?\"  \"Yes, honey, dat it am; sho's yer born, 'nother pet for ole mammy,--de bressed little darlin',\" she answered, pressing the little creature to her breast.  The information was received with a chorus of exclamations of delight and admiration.  \"Tate a bite of cacker, boy,\" said Herbert, offering a cracker which he was eating with evident enjoyment.  Mammy explained, amid the good-natured laughter of the older children, that the newcomer had no teeth and couldn't eat anything but milk.  \"Oh, poor 'ittle fing!\" he said, softly touching its velvet cheek. \"Won't 'oo tum and pay wis Herbie?\"  \"No, it can't play,\" said Violet, \"it can't walk and it can't talk.\"  \"Where's mamma, mammy?\" asked Eddie, glancing at the clock; \"it's past her time; I wonder too she didn't come to show us the new baby herself.\"  \"She's sick, chile,\" returned mammy, a grave and anxious look coming into her old eyes.  \"Mamma sick?\" exclaimed little Elsie, \"oh, may I go to her?\"  Mammy shook her head. \"Not jes now, honey darlin', byme by, when she's bettah.\"  \"Mamma sick?\" echoed Violet. \"Oh, I'm so, so sorry!\"  \"Don't fret, chillen, de good Lord make her well again soon,\" said mammy, with cheerful hopefulness, for she could not bear to see how sad each little face had grown, how the young lips quivered, and the bright eyes filled with tears; for dearly, dearly, they all loved their sweet, gentle mother.  \"Herbie wants mamma,\" sobbed the baby boy, clinging to his eldest sister.  \"Don't cry, pet,\" Elsie said chokingly, hugging him close and kissing away his tears. \"We'll all ask God to make her well, and I'm sure he will.\"  \"Why! why! what's the matter here?\" cried a cheery voice, as the door opened and Mr. Travilla stepped into their midst. \"What's the matter with papa's darlings?\" he repeated, gathering them all into his arms, and caressing each in turn.  \"Is mamma, dear mamma, very sick?\" they asked, Vi immediately adding in joyous tones,  \"No, no, she isn't, or papa wouldn't look so happy.\"  \"I am very happy,\" he said with emotion, glancing toward the bundle in mammy's lap, \"we are both very happy over the new treasure God has given us; and I trust she will soon be well.\"  \"Can we go and speak to her?\" they asked.  \"After a while,\" he said, \"she is trying to sleep now. What do you all think of the little sister?\"  \"Sister,\" cried Elsie. \"Oh, that is nice, nice! I thought it was a boy. What's its name, papa?\"  \"It has none yet.\"  \"I sorry for it,\" remarked Herbert, gazing with curious interest at the tiny creature, \"I sorry for it; cause can't walk, can't talk, can't eat good fings; dot no teef to eat wis. Do, boy, try to eat cacker, cacker dood, Herbie likes,\" and breaking off a fragment he would have forced it into the wee mouth, if papa and mammy had not interfered for its protection.  \"No, no, my son, you would choke it,\" said Mr. Travilla, gently drawing him away.  \"It isn't a boy; it's a girl, Herbie,\" corrected Harold.  \"Oh!\" cried Vi, who was gently feeling the top of the tiny head, and she looked aghast at her father, \"O, papa, its head's rotten!\"  \"No, daughter, don't be alarmed,\" he said smiling slightly, \"there's nothing wrong there; all young babies' heads are soft like that on the top.\"  \"Oh, are they?\" she said with a sigh of relief, \"I was afraid it would spoil soon and we couldn't keep her.\"  \"No, she seems to be all right,\" he said with a grave and tender smile. \"God has been very good to us.\"  \"Yes, papa. Oh such a pretty darling as it is!\" said Elsie.  \"Yes, indeed,\" chimed in the others; Vi adding, \"and I'm so glad she's a girl: 'cause now we have two sisters, Elsie, just the same as the boys.\"  \"Oh, but we have three now!\" said Eddie, laughing good naturedly at Vi's crestfallen look.  \"Oh, yes,\" she acknowledged, then brightening, \"but we have three brothers, and you only two; so it's even all around after all, isn't it, papa?\"  The children were full of delight over their treasure, and eager to show it to grandpa, grandma, Aunt Rosie, Aunt Wealthy and Aunt May; regretting much that the rest of their friends had left Viamede before the advent of the little stranger.  She proved a frail, gentle little creature, with violet eyes and pale golden hair, so fair and delicate that Lily was the name that most readily suggested itself and the one finally settled upon as really hers.  Lily became a great pet with them all, but Violet claimed a special property in her because as she would say, \"The darling came to us almost on my birthday and she's just the sweetest, prettiest birthday present mamma ever gave me.\"  The weather was growing very warm at Viamede and Aunt Wealthy and the little Duncans found the heat oppressive; so when Lily was three weeks old and the dear mamma able to be up again, looking bright and well, that party bade good-bye and set out on their return to Lansdale.  The Dinsmores and Travillas lingered until the middle of May, when they too set their faces northward, not parting company till very near to Ion and the Oaks.     CHAPTER SECOND.      \"Envy is but the smoke of low estate,      Ascending still against the fortunate.\"                                  --BROOKE.   It was dark and raining a little when the carriage turned into the avenue at Ion; but the whole front of the house was ablaze with lights, the hall door stood wide open, and a double line of servants in holiday attire, each sooty face dressed in smiles, stood waiting to welcome the weary travelers home.  There were many hearty shakings and kissings of hands; many fervent ejaculations: \"God bless you, Massa and Missus!\" \"Tank de Lord you's got home again, honey. We's been pinin' for you darlin's and for de sight of de new baby,\" and with the last words the voices were lowered at a sign from Aunt Chloe, in whose arms the little Lily lay sleeping sweetly.  There was some fretting among the weary little ones, but mamma and nurses were kind and gentle, and a good supper and bed soon cured all their troubles for that night.  Little Elsie was roused from her slumbers by a gentle shake, and starting up in bed, found the sun shining and Vi standing by her side with eager, excited face.  \"Come, come to the window!\" she cried. \"It does seem as if I must be dreaming; it wasn't there before, I'm sure.\"  \"What?\" asked Elsie, springing out upon the floor and hurrying after Vi to the window from which she had witnessed the burning of the schoolhouse.  \"There!\" said Violet, pointing with her finger, \"there! can you see it too?\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Elsie, clasping her hands in a sort of ecstasy of delight, \"oh, aren't papa and mamma good? How did they ever come to think of it! and how could they get it done while they were away?\"  \"Grandpa, Uncle Horace and Cal,\" suggested Vi. \"Oh, aren't you glad? Aren't you glad, Elsie?\"  \"I should think so! and the boat is ever so pretty. Let's hurry and get dressed and go down and see it closer.\"  Rowing and sailing upon the bayou and lakelet had been the children's greatest pleasure at Viamede, their greatest regret in leaving it. Knowing this, their ever"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],["title","Elsie's children (#1)"],["body"," parents had prepared a pleasant surprise for them, causing a small tract of barren land on the Ion estate to be turned into an artificial lake. It was this, shining in the golden beams of the morning sun, and a beautiful boat moored to the hither shore, that had called forth from the lips of the little girls those exclamations of almost incredulous wonder and delight.  \"Yes; I'll ring for Dinah,\" cried Vi, skipping across the room and putting out her hand to lay hold of the bell pull.  \"Wait, Vi, our prayers first, you know,\" said Elsie.  \"Oh, yes! I do want to thank God for being so good to us; the pretty lake and boat and all.\"  \"Dear kind parents, safe journey home, too, and oh more things than we can count,\" added Elsie, as they knelt down side by side.  This duty performed with no irreverent haste, the maid was summoned and a careful toilet made in season to afford them time for a walk before mamma would be ready to see them.  They found their father in the lower veranda talking with the overseer, while Solon stood waiting with Beppo's bridle in his hand, the horse pawing the ground with impatience.  Eddie was there, too, caressing Bruno who seemed as glad to be at home again as any of the rest. Uttering a joyous bark he left his young master and bounded to meet the little girls.  Mr. Travilla turned at the sound and with a kind fatherly smile, held out his hands.  \"O papa,\" they cried running to him, \"how good of you to have it made for us!\"  \"Good-morning, my darlings,\" he said, giving and receiving caresses, \"but what are you talking about?\"  \"Why the lake, papa; the lake and the boat.\"  \"Lake?\" exclaimed Eddie, \"why where?\"  \"Oh, you couldn't see it from your windows,\" said Elsie. \"Papa, papa, may we go now and look at it?\"  \"Yes,\" he said, taking a hand of each. \"Larkin, I'll see you again after breakfast. Come, Eddie, my son, you too, and Bruno.\"  A brisk five minutes' walk brought them to the shore of the lake, a tiny one, scarce a quarter of a mile in circumference, not very deep and the water so clear that the pebbly bottom could be distinctly seen; gold and silver fish, too, gliding hither and thither; while a pretty, gayly painted row-boat lying at the water's edge, rocked gently in the morning breeze.  Eddie hailed the scene with a shout of delight; the little girls danced about gleefully, Vi clapping her hands and asking eagerly if they might get into the boat.  Papa looked at his watch, \"Yes, there will be time for a row; one trip around the lake. Step in, all of you, and I will take the oars.\"  Vi was quite ready and Eddie gallantly handed her in, then turned and offered his hand to Elsie. She demurred. \"But mamma! shouldn't we have mamma with us the first time?\" and she looked up inquiringly into her father's face.  \"Yes, yes, of course!\" cried the others making haste to step ashore again, \"we want dear mamma with us the very first time.\"  Papa smiled approval. \"Then we will go back,\" he said, \"and after breakfast, if mamma is willing, we will all come and take a row together; the boat is large enough to carry us all at once.\"  Mamma's consent was readily obtained, for to please her children was her great delight. So shortly after breakfast they all repaired to the lake and rowed round and across it several times, a merry, happy party.  At Roselands the family were gathered about the breakfast table and the principal topic of conversation was the return of the party from Viamede. Calhoun had been to the Oaks the previous evening and learned of their safe arrival.  \"We must all go this morning and call upon them,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.  \"We'll divide our forces,\" said Cal, laughing. \"Suppose grandpa, mother and Aunt Enna, go first to the Oaks; and we younger ones to Ion?\"  \"Very well,\" replied the old gentleman, \"I shall spend an hour with my son, then ride over to see Elsie and her little flock. How many of you young folks want to go to Ion in the first division?\"  \"I!\" \"And I!\" \"And I!\" cried one and another.  \"But you can't go all at once,\" returned their grandfather, looking around upon them with an amused smile; \"the carriage is roomy, but really you are too many for it. Besides wouldn't there be some danger of overwhelming your cousins?\"  \"Well, I'm going, let who will stay at home,\" observed Molly Percival with cool decision. \"The boys can ride, I mean Cal, and Art, and Dick and Wal; they all have ponies and the two carriages will hold the rest of us if we crowd a little.\"  \"I'm not going to be bothered with Bob or Betty,\" said her mother; \"they may go with you, or wait till another time.\"  \"Then they'll wait,\" remarked Isadore Conly, \"for I shall wear my best silk suit, and I have no notion of having it tumbled.\"  \"Last year's suit is quite good enough for the occasion,\" said her mother, \"they're only cousins.\"  \"But rich ones, that can afford to dress, and I'll not go a step if I have to look shabby.\"  \"Nor I,\" chimed in her sister. \"So mamma you may as well resign yourself to the situation. It's no good finding fault or objecting,\" she added with a laugh.  \"Take your own way, then,\" returned her mother indifferently, \"but remember there'll be no more new dresses this season.\"  \"Dear me, why aren't we as rich as the Travillas?\" pouted Isadore. \"I do think things are very unequally divided in this world.\"  \"Never mind; the wheel of fortune often takes a turn,\" said her mother. \"You may have money left you some day (some of your father's relations are still rich), and you may make a grand match.\"  \"How long will it take you girls to don your finery?\" ask Cal, pulling out his watch. \"We'd better start as soon as we can: the sun will be getting hot.\"  \"I'm done,\" said Molly, jumping up, \"and I'll be ready by the time the carriage can be brought to the door. Come Isa and Virgy, you've eaten enough. Cousin Elsie will be sure to treat us to something good.\" And she ran gayly from the room.  Molly, just turned thirteen, and already as tall as her mother, was a bright, lively girl, full of fun and frolic. She was not a beauty, but had a clear complexion and fine dark eyes, and good humor and intelligence lent a charm to her face that made it more than ordinarily attractive.  Dick had always been fond of her, and was beginning to take a brotherly pride in her good looks and intellectual gifts.  Enna's feelings toward her were divided between motherly pride and affection on the one hand, and on the other the dread of being made to appear old by the side of so tall a daughter; a dread that made her jealous of Dick also.  The Conly girls, too, were growing fast, giving promise of fair, graceful womanhood, Isadore particularly of great beauty; which her mother fondly hoped would be the means of securing her a wealthy husband; for Mrs. Conly's affections were wholly set upon the things of this life; by her and her sister Enna, wealth and beauty were esteemed the highest good, and their children were trained in accordance with that view; the moral atmosphere of the house being very different from that of Ion, where the lives and conversation of the parents were such as to leave no doubt in the minds of their children, that to them the things of time and sense were as nothing in comparison with those of eternity.  Enna followed her daughter into the dressing-room they used in common.  \"Wear the very best you have, Molly,\" she said, \"I don't want you to be looked down upon as a poor relation, or to have it said that the Conlys dress better than my children.\"  \"I'm sure they don't,\" said Molly, ringing for the maid, \"though they'd like to if they could, and are always jealous when grandpa makes me a present.\"  \"Of course they are, and they manage to get more than their fair share, too,\" acquiesced the mother in a tone of irritation; \"but do you see to it that they don't get ahead of you at Ion; remember Elsie is as rich as a Jew, and likes the credit of being generous, so keep on the right side of her, if you want handsome presents.\"  \"I'm sure she is generous and doesn't give only for the credit of it,\" said Molly.  \"Don't give me any impudence,\" returned her mother sharply. \"Rachel,\" to the maid who just then came in in answer to the bell, \"dress Miss Molly first, and be quick about it.\"  Enna superintended the business in person, and in a way that sorely tried the temper and nerves of both Molly and the maid; the child's sash must be tied and retied, her hat bent this way and that, her collar and brooch changed again and again, till she was ready to cry with impatience; and when at last she started for the door, she was called back, and Rachel ordered to change her slippers for gaiter boots.  \"I don't want to wear them!\" cried Molly, fairly stamping with impatience. \"The heels are so high and narrow, I can't bear them.\"  \"They're just the style and make your foot look beautiful,\" said her mother, \"sit down and let Rachel put them on you.\"  \"Grandpa says they're dangerous, and so does Dr. Barton, too,\" grumbled Molly.  \"Put them on her, Rachel,\" commanded Enna. \"Molly, behave yourself, or you'll stay at home.\"  The child submitted rather sullenly, muttering that she would be late.  Rachel was fastening the second boot, when Isadore and Virginia were heard running down the stairs, calling out that the carriage was at the door.  \"There! I knew you'd make me too late!\" cried Molly. \"Oh, Rachel, do hurry!\"  \"Yes, Miss Molly, best I kin; dar dat's de las' button.\"  Up sprang Molly, and away in hot haste. She gained the landing, caught her heel in the carpet on the first step of the next flight, and a wild shriek rang through the house, accompanied by the sound of a heavy body tumbling and rolling down the stairs.  Echoing the scream, Enna rushed out into the upper hall.  Calhoun at the foot of the stairs, was picking Molly up.  \"Is she hurt? Is she killed?\" asked the mother, \"Molly, Molly, how did you come to be so awkward?\"  \"I wasn't! it was those heels; I knew they'd throw me down some day!\" cried"]]]
