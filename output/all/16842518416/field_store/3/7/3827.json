This act, more than all other acts, laid the ax at the root of the evil. It is false to say he had no other faults.  The hosts still stand in strangest plight. That last still night. That lasts till night. On either side an ocean exists. On neither side a notion exists. Among the rugged rocks the restless ranger ran. I said pop-u-lar, not  pop'lar. I said pre-vail, not pr'vail. I said be-hold, not b'hold.  Think'st thou so meanly of my Phocion? Henceforth look to your hearths. Canst thou minister to a mind diseased? A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call.    ACCENT.  Accent, marked thus ('), is an increased force of voice upon some one syllable of a word; as, Col'o-ny, bot'a-ny; re-mem'ber, im-por'tant; rec-ol-lect', rep-re-sent'. In the words col'o-ny and bot'a-ny, the first syllable is accented. In the words re-mem'ber and im-por'tant, the second syllable is accented. In the words rec-ol-lect' and rep-re-sent', the third  syllable is accented.    INFLECTION.  Inflection is an upward or downward slide of the voice. The Rising Inflection, sometimes marked thus ('), is an upward slide of the voice.  Examples  Has he come'? Has he gone? Are you sick'? Will you go'? Are they here'?   The Falling Inflection, marked thus (') is a downward slide of the voice.  Examples  They are here. He has gone. He has come I will go. I am well.   Let the pupil practice these examples until he is perfectly familiar with the rising and falling inflections.  Are you sick or well?      Will you go, or stay? Did he ride, or walk?      Is it black, or white? Is he rich, or poor?       Are they old, or young? Did you say cap, or cat?   I said cat, not cap. Did you say am, or ham?    I said ham, not am.   Is the dog white', or black'? The dog is black', not white'. Did you say and', or hand'? I said and', not hand'. Is the tree large', or small'? The tree is small', not large'. Are the apples sweet', or sour'? The apples are sour' not sweet'. Is the tide high', or low'? The tide is high', not low'. Did you say play', or pray'? I said pray', not play'.     MCGUFFEY'S FOURTH READER.    I. PERSEVERANCE. (25)  1. \"Will you give my kite a lift?\" said my little nephew to his sister, after trying in vain to make it fly by dragging it along the ground. Lucy very kindly took it up and threw it into the air, but, her brother neglecting to run off at the same moment, the kite fell down again.  2. \"Ah! now, how awkward you are!\" said the little fellow. \"It was your fault entirely,\" answered his sister. \"Try again, children,\" said I.  3. Lucy once more took up the kite. But now John was in too great a hurry; he ran off so suddenly that he twitched the kite out of her hand, and it fell flat as before. \"Well, who is to blame now?\" asked Lucy. \"Try again,\" said I.  4. They did, and with more care; but a side wind coming suddenly, as Lucy let go the kite, it was blown against some shrubs, and the tail became entangled in a moment, leaving the poor kite hanging with its head downward.  5. \"There, there!\" exclaimed John, \"that comes of your throwing it all to one side.\" \"As if I could make the wind blow straight,\" said Lucy. In the meantime, I went to the kite's assistance; and having disengaged the long tail, I rolled it up, saying, \"Come, children, there are too many trees here; let us find a more open space, and then try again.\"  6. We presently found a nice grassplot, at one side of which I took my stand; and all things being prepared, I tossed the kite up just as little John ran off. It rose with all the dignity of a balloon, and promised a lofty flight; but John, delighted to find it pulling so hard at the string, stopped short to look upward and admire. The string slackened, the kite wavered, and, the wind not being very favorable, down came the kite to the grass. \"O John, you should not have stopped,\" said I. \"However, try again.\"  7. \"I won't try any more,\" replied he, rather sullenly. \"It is of no use, you see. The kite won't fly, and I don't want to be plagued with it any longer.\" \"Oh, fie, my little man! would you give up the sport, after all the pains we have taken both to make and to fly the kite? A few disappointments ought not to discourage us. Come, I have wound up your string, and now try again.\"  8. And he did try, and succeeded, for the kite was carried upward on the breeze as lightly as a feather; and when the string was all out, John stood in great delight, holding fast the stick and gazing on the kite, which now seemed like a little white speck in the blue sky. \"Look, look, aunt, how high it flies! and it pulls like a team of horses, so that I can hardly hold it. I wish I had a mile of string: I am sure it would go to the end of it.\"  9. After enjoying the sight as long as he pleased, little John proceeded to roll up the string slowly; and when the kite fell, he took it up with great glee, saying that it was not at all hurt, and that it had behaved very well. \"Shall we come out to-morrow, aunt, after lessons, and try again?\"  10. \"I have no objection, my dear, if the weather is fine. And now, as we walk home, tell me what you have learned from your morning's sport.\" \"I have learned to fly my kite properly.\" \"You may thank aunt for it, brother,\" said Lucy, \"for you would have given it up long ago, if she had not persuaded you to try again.\"  11. \"Yes, dear children, I wish to teach you the value of perseverance, even when nothing more depends upon it than the flying of a kite. Whenever you fail in your attempts to do any good thing, let your motto be,--try again.\"   DEFINITIONS.--In defining words, that meaning is given which is appropriate to them in the connection in which they are used.   4. En-tan'gled, twisted in, disordered. 5. As-sist'-ance, help, aid. Dis-en-gaged, cleared, set free. 6. Grass'plot, a space covered with grass. Dig'ni-ty, majestic manner. 7. Dis-ap-point/ments, failures or defeats of expectation. Dis-cour'age, take away courage. 9. Glee, joy  11. Per-se-ver'ance, continuance in anything once begun. Mot'to, a short sentence or a word full of meaning.  EXERCISES--What is the subject of this lesson? Why was John discouraged in his attempts to fly his kite? What did his, aunt say to him? What may we learn from this? What should be our motto if we expect to be successful?    II. TRY, TRY AGAIN. (28)  1. 'T is a lesson you should heed,      Try, try again;    If at first you don't succeed,      Try, try again;    Then your courage should appear,    For, if you will persevere,    You will conquer, never fear;      Try, try again.  2. Once or twice though you should fail,      Try, try again;    If you would at last prevail,      Try, try again;    If we strive, 'tis no disgrace    Though we do not win the race;    What should you do in the case?      Try, try again.  3. If you find your task is hard,      Try, try again;    Time will bring you your reward,      Try, try again.    All that other folks can do,    Why, with patience, should not you?    Only keep this rule in view:      Try, try again.   DEFINITIONS.--l. Cour'age, resolution. Con'quer, gain the vic-tory. 2. Pre-vail, overcome.  Dis-grace', shame. Win, gain, ob-tain. 3. Re-ward', anything given in return for good or bad con-duct. Pa'-tience, constany in labor.   EXERCISES.--What does the mark before \"'T is\" mean? What is it called? What point is used after the word \"case\" in the second stanza? Why?    III. WHY THE SEA IS SALT. (29) A FAIRY TALE.  Mary Howitt was born in 1804, at Coleford, England. She wrote many charming stories for children in prose and verse, and also translated many from Swedish, Danish, and German authors. This story is arranged from one in a collection named \"Peter Drake's Dream, and Other Stories.\" She died in 1888.  1. There were, in very ancient times, two brothers, one of whom was rich, and the other poor. Christmas was approaching, but the poor man had nothing in the house for a Christmas dinner; so he went to his brother and asked him for a trifling gift.  2. The rich man was ill-natured, and when he heard his brother's request he looked very surly. But as Christmas is a time when even the worst people give gifts, he took a fine ham down from the chimney, where it was hanging to smoke, threw it at his brother, and bade him begone and never to let him see his face again.  3. The poor man thanked his brother for the ham, put it under his arm, and went his way. He had to pass through a great forest on his way home. When he had reached the thickest part of it, he saw an old man, with a long, white beard, hewing timber. \"Good evening,\" said he to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],["title","McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#4)"],["body",".  4. \"Good evening,\" returned the old man, raising himself up from his work, and looking at him. \"That is a fine ham you are carrying.\" On this, the poor man told him all about it.  5. \"It is lucky for you,\" said the old man, \"that you have met with me. If you will take that ham into the land of the dwarfs, the entrance to which lies just under the roots of this tree, you can make a capital bargain with it; for the dwarfs are very fond of ham, and rarely get any. But mind what I say: you must not sell it for money, but demand for it the 'old hand mill which stands behind the door.' When you come back, I'll show you how to use it.\"  6. The poor man thanked his new friend, who showed him the door under a stone below the roots of the tree, and by this door he entered into the land of the dwarfs. No sooner had he set his foot in it, than the dwarfs swarmed about him, attracted by the smell of the ham. They offered him queer, old-fashioned money and gold and silver ore for it; but he refused all their tempting offers, and said that he would sell it only for the old hand mill behind the door.  7. At this, the dwarfs held up their little old hands, and looked quite perplexed. \"We can not make a bargain, it seems,\" said the poor man, \"so I'll bid you all a good day.\"  8. The fragrance of the ham had by this time reached the remote parts of dwarf land. The dwarfs came flocking around in little troops, leaving their work of digging out precious ores, eager for the ham.  9. \"Let him have the old mill,\" said some of the newcomers; \"it is quite out of order, and he don't know how to use it. Let him have it, and we will have the ham.\"  10. So the bargain was made. The poor man took the old hand mill, which was a little thing not half so large as the ham, and went back to the woods. Here the old man showed him how to use it. All this had taken up a great deal of time, and it was midnight before he reached home.  11. \"Where in the world have you been?\" said his wife. \"Here I have been waiting and waiting, and we have no wood to make a fire, nor anything to put into the porridge pot for our Christmas supper.\"  12. The house was dark and cold; but the poor man bade his wife wait and see what would happen. He placed the little hand mill on the table, and began to turn the crank. First, out there came some grand, lighted wax candles, and a fire on the hearth, and a porridge pot boiling over it, because in his mind he said they should come first. Then he ground out a tablecloth, and dishes, and spoons, and knives and forks.  13. He was himself astonished at his good luck, as you may believe; and his wife was almost beside herself with joy and astonishment. Well, they had a capital supper; and after it was eaten, they ground out of the mill every possible thing to make their house and themselves warm and comfortable. So they had a merry Christmas eve and morning.  DEFINITIONS.--l. Tri'-fling, of small value. 5. Hand 'mill, a mill turned by hand. 6. At-tract'ed, drawn to, allured. 7. Perplexed', puzzled. 8. Fra'grance, sweetness of smell.    IV. WHY THE SEA IS SALT. (32) (Concluded.)  1. When the people went by the house to church, the next day, they could hardly believe their eyes. There was glass in the windows instead of a wooden shutter, and the poor man and his wife, dressed in nice new clothes, were seen devoutly kneeling in the church.  2. \"There is something very strange in all this,\" said everyone. \"Something very strange indeed,\" said the rich man, when three days afterwards he received an invitation from his once poor brother to a grand feast. And what a feast it was! The table was covered with a cloth as white as snow, and the dishes were all of silver or gold. The rich man could not, in his great house, and with all his wealth, set out such a table.  3. \"Where did you get all these things?\" exclaimed he. His brother told him all about the bargain he had made with the dwarfs, and putting the mill on the table, ground out boots and shoes, coats and cloaks, stockings, gowns, and blankets, and bade his wife give them to the poor people that had gathered about the house to get a sight of the grand feast the poor brother had made for the rich one.  4. The rich man, was very envious of his brother's good fortune, and wanted to borrow the mill, intending--for he was not an honest man--never to return it again. His brother would not lend it, for the old man with the white beard had told him never to sell or lend it to anyone.  5. Some years went on, and, at last, the possessor of the mill built himself a grand castle on a rock by the sea, facing the west. Its windows, reflecting the golden sunset, could be seen far out from the shore. It became a noted landmark for sailors. Strangers from foreign parts often came to see this castle and the wonderful mill of which the most extraordinary tales were told.  6. At length, a great foreign merchant came, and when he had seen the mill, inquired whether it would grind salt. Being told that it would, he wanted to buy it; for he traded in salt, and thought that if he owned it he could supply all his customers without taking long and dangerous voyages.  7. The man would not sell it, of course. He was so rich now that he did not want to use it for himself; but every Christmas he ground out food and clothes and coal for the poor, and nice presents for the little children. So he rejected all the offers of the rich merchant. The merchant, however, determined to have it; he bribed one of the man's servants to let him go into the castle at night, and he stole the mill and sailed away with it in triumph.  8. He had scarcely got out to sea, before he determined to set the mill to work. \"Now, mill, grind salt,\" said he; \"grind salt with all your might!--salt, salt, and nothing but salt!\" The mill began to grind and the sailors to fill the sacks; but these were soon full, and in spite of all that could be done, it began to fill the ship.  9. The dishonest merchant was now very much frightened. What was to be done? The mill would not stop grinding; and at last the ship was overloaded, and down it went, making a great whirlpool where it sank. The ship soon went to pieces; but the mill stands on the bottom of the sea, and keeps grinding  out \"salt, salt, nothing but salt!\" That is the reason, say the peasants of Denmark and Norway, why the sea is salt.   DEFINITIONS.--l. De-vout'ly, in a reverent manner. 5. Re--flect'ing, throwing back light, heat, etc., as a mirror. Land'-mark, an object on land serving as a guide to seamen. Ex-traor'--di-na-ry, wonderful. 9. Whirl'-pool, a gulf in which the water moves round in a circle. Peas'ents, those belonging to the lowest class of tillers of the soil in Europe.   EXERCISES.--What is a \"fairy tale\"?  What fairy people are told about in this story? How did the poor man find the way to the land of the dwarfs? Do you think the old man would have told him if the poor man had not been so polite? How did the poor man treat his rich brother in return for his unkindness? How was the greed of the dishonest merchant punished? What is meant by \"strangers from foreign parts\"? Where are Denmark and Norway?    V. POPPING CORN. (34)  1. One autumn night, when the wind was high,      And the rain fell in heavy plashes,    A little boy sat by the kitchen fire,      A-popping corn in the ashes;    And his sister, a curly-haired child of three,    Sat looking on, just close to his knee.  2. Pop! pop! and the kernels, one by one,      Came out of the embers flying;    The boy held a long pine stick in his hand,      And kept it busily plying;    He stirred the corn and it snapped the more,    And faster jumped to the clean-swept floor.  3. Part of the kernels flew one way,      And a part hopped out the other;    Some flew plump into the sister's lap,      Some under the stool of the brother;    The little girl gathered them into a heap,    And called them a flock of milk-white sheep.    VI. SMILES. (35)  1. Poor lame Jennie sat at her window, looking out upon the dismal, narrow street, with a look of pain and weariness on her face. \"Oh, dear,\" she said with a sigh, \"what a long day this is going to be,\" and she looked wishfully up the street.  2. Suddenly she leaned forward and pressed her pale face against the glass, as a rosy-checked boy came racing down the street, swinging his schoolbooks by the strap. Looking up to the window, he took off his hat and bowed with a bright, pleasant smile.  3. \"What a nice boy he is,\" said Jennie to herself, as he ran out of sight. \"I am so glad he goes by here on his way to school. When he smiles, it seems like having the sun shine. I wish everybody who goes by would look up and smile.\"  4. \"Mamma,\" said George West, as he came from school, \"I can't help thinking about that poor little girl I told you of the other day. She looks so tired. I took off my hat and bowed to her to-day. I wish I could do something for her,\"  5. \"Suppose you should carry her a handful of pretty flowers some time when you go to school,\" said Mrs. West. \"I'll do that to-morrow morning,\" said George, \"if I can find my way into that rickety old house.\"  6. The next morning, as Jennie sat leaning her head wearily against the window, watching the raindrops chasing one another down the glass, she spied George with a handful of beautiful flowers carefully picking his way across the street. He stopped in front of her window, and, smiling very pleasantly, said, \"How shall I find the way to your room?\"  7. Jennie pointed to an alley near by, where he turned in, and with some difficulty found his way to the dingy staircase. Opening the door to Jennie's gentle \"Come in,\" he said, \"I have brought you a handful of flowers to look at this rainy day.\"  8. \"Are they for me?\" exclaimed Jennie, clapping her hands in delight. \"How kind you are,\" she continued, as George laid them in her lap. \"I have not had a flower since we live in the city.\"  9. \"Did you use to live in the country?\""]]]
