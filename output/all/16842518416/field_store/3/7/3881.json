NEW YORK  AMERICAN PUBLISHERS CORPORATION  310-318 SIXTH AVENUE  1881     TO  HARRY AND JAMES GARFIELD  WHOSE PRIVATE SORROW  IS THE PUBLIC GRIEF,  THIS MEMORIAL OF THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER  Is inscribed  WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY.     GENERAL PREFACE.   The present series of volumes has been undertaken with the view of supplying the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined with a plain and concise mode of narration. The writings of Charles Dickens have been selected as the basis of the scheme, on account of the well-known excellence of his portrayal of children, and the interests connected with children--qualities which have given his volumes their strongest hold on the hearts of parents. These delineations having thus received the approval of readers of mature age, it seemed a worthy effort to make the young also participants in the enjoyment of these classic fictions, to introduce the children of real life to these beautiful children of the imagination.  With this view, the career of Little Nell and her Grandfather, Oliver, Little Paul, Florence Dombey, Smike, and the Child-Wife, have been detached from the large mass of matter with which they were originally connected, and presented, in the author's own language, to a new class of readers, to whom the little volumes will we doubt not, be as attractive as the larger originals have so long proved to the general public. We have brought down these famous stories from the library to the nursery--the parlor table to the child's hands--having a precedent for the proceeding, if one be needed, in the somewhat similar work, the Tales from Shakespeare, by one of the choicest of English authors and most reverential of scholars, Charles Lamb.  Newtonville, Mass.     PREFACE.   If I am asked why I add one to the numerous Lives of our dead President, I answer, in the words of Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, because \"our annals afford no such incentive to youth as does his life, and it will become one of the Republic's household stories.\"  I have conceived, therefore, that a biography, written with a view to interest young people in the facts of his great career, would be a praiseworthy undertaking. The biography of General Garfield, however imperfectly executed, can not but be profitable to the reader. In this story, which I have made as attractive as I am able, I make no claim to originality. I have made free use of such materials as came within my reach, including incidents and reminiscences made public during the last summer, and I trust I have succeeded, in a measure, in conveying a correct idea of a character whose nobility we have only learned to appreciate since death has snatched our leader from us.  I take pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to two Lives of Garfield, one by Edmund Kirke, the other by Major J.M. Bundy. Such of my readers as desire a more extended account of the later life of Gen. Garfield, I refer to these well-written and instructive works.  HORATIO ALGER, JR.  New York, _Oct_. 8, 1881.

From a small and rudely-built log-cabin a sturdy boy of four years issued, and looked earnestly across the clearing to the pathway that led through the surrounding forest. His bare feet pressed the soft grass, which spread like a carpet before the door.  \"What are you looking for, Jimmy?\" asked his mother from within the humble dwelling.  \"I'm looking for Thomas,\" said Jimmy.  \"It's hardly time for him yet. He won't be through work till after sunset.\"  \"Then I wish the sun would set quick,\" said Jimmy.  \"That is something we can not hasten, my son. God makes the sun to rise and to set in its due season.\"  This idea was probably too advanced for Jimmy's comprehension, for he was but four years of age, and the youngest of a family of four children. His father had died two years before, leaving a young widow, and four children, the eldest but nine, in sore straits. A long and severe winter lay before the little family, and they had but little corn garnered to carry them through till the next harvest. But the young widow was a brave woman and a devoted mother.  \"God will provide for us,\" she said, but sometimes it seemed a mystery how that provision was to come. More than once, when the corn was low in the bin, she went to bed without her own supper, that her four children, who were blessed with hearty appetites, might be satisfied. But when twelve months had gone by, and the new harvest came in, the fields which she and her oldest boy had planted yielded enough to place them beyond the fear of want. God did help them, but it was because they helped themselves.  But beyond the barest necessaries the little family neither expected nor obtained much. Clothing cost money, and there was very little money in the log-cabin, or indeed in the whole settlement, if settlement it can be called. There was no house within a mile, and the village a mile and a half away contained only a school-house, a grist-mill, and a little log store and dwelling.  Two weeks before my story opens, a farmer living not far away called at the log-cabin. Thomas, the oldest boy, was at work in a field near the house.  \"Do you want to see mother?\" he asked.  \"No, I want to see you.\"  \"All right, sir! Here I am,\" said Thomas, smiling pleasantly.  \"How old are you?\" asked the farmer.  \"Eleven years old, sir.\"  The farmer surveyed approvingly the sturdy frame, broad shoulders, and muscular arms of the boy, and said, after a pause, \"You look pretty strong of your age.\"  \"Oh, yes, sir,\" answered Thomas, complacently \"I am strong.\"  \"And you are used to farm work?\"  \"Yes, sir. I do about all the outdoor work at home, being the only boy. Of course, there is Jimmy, but he is only four, and that's too young to work on the farm.\"  \"What does he want?\" thought Thomas.  He soon learned.  \"I need help on my farm, and I guess you will suit me,\" said Mr. Conrad, though that was not his name. In fact, I don't know his name, but that will do as well as any other.  \"I don't know whether mother can spare me, but I can ask her,\" said Thomas. \"What are you willing to pay?\"  \"I'll give you twelve dollars a month, but you'll have to make long days.\"  Twelve dollars a month! Tom's eyes sparkled with joy, for to him it seemed an immense sum--and it would go very far in the little family.  \"I am quite sure mother will let me go,\" he said. \"I'll go in and ask her.\"  \"Do so, sonny, and I'll wait for you here.\"  Thomas swung open the plank door, and entered the cabin.  It was about twenty feet one way by thirty the other. It had three small windows, a deal floor, and the spaces between the logs of which it was built were filled in with clay. It was certainly an humble dwelling, and the chances are that not one of my young readers is so poor as not to afford a better. Yet, it was not uncomfortable. It afforded fair protection from the heat of summer, and the cold of winter, and was after all far more desirable as a home than the crowded tenements of our larger cities, for those who occupied it had but to open the door and windows to breathe the pure air of heaven, uncontaminated by foul odors or the taint of miasma.  \"Mother,\" said Thomas, \"Mr. Conrad wants to hire me to work on his farm, and he is willing to pay me twelve dollars a month. May I go?\"  \"Ask Mr. Conrad to come in, Thomas.\"  The farmer entered, and repeated his request.  Mrs. Garfield, for this was the widow's name, was but little over thirty. She had a strong, thoughtful face, and a firm mouth, that spoke a decided character. She was just the woman to grapple with adversity, and turning her unwearied hands to any work, to rear up her children in the fear of the Lord, and provide for their necessities as well as circumstances would admit.  She didn't like to spare Thomas, for much of his work would be thrown upon her, but there was great lack of ready money and the twelve dollars were a powerful temptation.  \"I need Thomas at home,\" she said slowly, \"but I need the money more. He may go, if he likes.\"  \"I will go,\" said Thomas promptly.  \"How often can you let him come home?\" was the next question.  \"Every fortnight, on Saturday night. He shall bring his wages then.\"  This was satisfactory, and Thomas, not stopping to change his clothes, for he had but one suit, went off with his employer.  His absence naturally increased his mother's work, and was felt "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14964"],["title","From Canal Boy to President; Or, the Boyhood and Manhood of James A. Garfield (#1)"],["body","a sore loss by Jimmy, who was in the habit of following him about, and watching him when he was at work. Sometimes his brother gave the little fellow a trifle to do, and Jimmy was always pleased to help, for he was fond of work, and when he grew older and stronger he was himself a sturdy and indefatigable worker in ways not dreamed of then.  The first fortnight was up, and Thomas was expected home. No one was more anxious to see him than his little brother, and that was why Jimmy had come out from his humble home, and was looking so earnestly across the clearing.  At last he saw him, and ran as fast as short legs could carry him to meet his brother.  \"Oh, Tommy, how I've missed you!\" he said.  \"Have you, Jimmy?\" asked Thomas, passing his arm around his little brother's neck. \"I have missed you too, and all the family. Are all well?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"That is good.\"  As they neared the cabin Mrs. Garfield came out, and welcomed her oldest boy home.  \"We are all glad to see you, Thomas,\" she said. \"How have you got along?\"  \"Very well, mother.\"  \"Was the work hard?\"  \"The hours were pretty long. I had to work fourteen hours a day.\"  \"That is too long for a boy of your age to work,\" said his mother anxiously.  \"Oh, it hasn't hurt me, mother,\" said Thomas, laughing. \"Besides, you must remember I have been well paid. What do you say to that?\"  He drew from his pocket twelve silver half-dollars, and laid them on the table, a glittering heap.  \"Is it all yours, Tommy?\" asked his little brother wonderingly.  \"No, it belongs to mother. I give it to her.\"  \"Thank you, Thomas,\" said Mrs. Garfield, \"but at least you ought to be consulted about how it shall be spent. Is there anything you need for yourself?\"  \"Oh, never mind me! I want Jimmy to have a pair of shoes.\"  Jimmy looked with interest at his little bare feet, and thought he would like some shoes. In fact they would be his first, for thus far in life he had been a barefooted boy.  \"Jimmy shall have his shoes,\" said Mrs. Garfield; \"when you see the shoemaker ask him to come here as soon as he can make it convenient.\"  So, a few days later the shoemaker, who may possibly have had no shop of his own, called at the log-cabin, measured Jimmy for a pair of shoes, and made them on the spot, boarding out a part of his pay.  The first pair of shoes made an important epoch in Jimmy Garfield's life, for it was decided that he could now go to school.     CHAPTER II.  GROWING IN WISDOM AND STATURE.   The school was in the village a mile and a half away. It was a long walk for a little boy of four, but sometimes his sister Mehetabel, now thirteen years old, carried him on her back. When in winter the snow lay deep on the ground Jimmy's books were brought home, and he recited his lessons to his mother.  This may be a good time to say something of the family whose name in after years was to become a household word throughout the republic. They had been long in the country. They were literally one of the first families, for in 1636, only sixteen years after the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth rock, and the same year that Harvard College was founded, Edward Garfield, who had come from the edge of Wales, settled in Watertown, Massachusetts, less than four miles from the infant college, and there for more than a century was the family home, as several moss-grown headstones in the ancient graveyard still testify.  They did their part in the Revolutionary war, and it was not till the war was over that Solomon Garfield, the great grandfather of the future President, removed to the town of Worcester, Otsego County, N.Y. Here lived the Garfields for two generations. Then Abram Garfield, the father of James, moved to Northeastern Ohio, and bought a tract of eighty acres, on which stood the log-cabin, built by himself, in which our story opens. His wife belonged to a distinguished family of New England--the Ballous--and possessed the strong traits of her kindred.  But the little farm of eighty acres was smaller now. Abram Garfield died in debt, and his wife sold off fifty acres to pay his creditors, leaving thirty, which with her own industry and that of her oldest son served to maintain her little family.  The school-house was so far away that Mrs. Garfield, who appreciated the importance of education for her children, offered her neighbors a site for a new school-house on her own land, and one was built. Here winter after winter came teachers, some of limited qualifications, to instruct the children of the neighborhood, and here Jimmy enlarged his stock of book-learning by slow degrees.  The years passed, and still they lived in the humble log-cabin, till at the age of twenty-one Thomas came home from Michigan, where he had been engaged in clearing land for a farmer, bringing seventy-five dollars in gold.  \"Now, mother,\" he said, \"you shall have a framed house.\"  Seventy-five dollars would not pay for a framed house, but he cut timber himself, got out the boards, and added his own labor, and that of Jimmy, now fourteen years old, and so the house was built, and the log-cabin became a thing of the past. But it had been their home for a long time, and doubtless many happy days had been spent beneath its humble roof.  While the house was being built, Jimmy learned one thing--that he was handy with tools, and was well fitted to become a carpenter. When the joiner told him that he was born to be a carpenter, he thought with joy that this unexpected talent would enable him to help his mother, and earn something toward the family expenses. So, for the next two years he worked at this new business when opportunity offered, and if my reader should go to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, he could probably find upon inquiry several barns in the vicinity which Jimmy helped to build.  He still went to school, however, and obtained such knowledge of the mysteries of grammar, arithmetic, and geography as could be obtained in the common schools of that day.  But Jimmy Garfield was not born to be a carpenter, and I believe never got so far along as to assist in building a house.  He was employed to build a wood-shed for a black-salter, ten miles away from his mother's house, and when the job was finished his employer fell into conversation with him, and being a man of limited acquirements himself, was impressed by the boy's surprising stock of knowledge.  \"You kin read, you kin write, and you are death on figgers,\" he said to him one day. \"If you'll stay with me, keep my 'counts, and 'tend to the saltery, I'll find you, and give you fourteen dollars a month.\"  Jimmy was dazzled by this brilliant offer. He felt that to accept it would be to enter upon the high-road to riches, and he resolved to do so if his mother would consent. Ten miles he trudged through the woods to ask his mother's consent, which with some difficulty he obtained, for she did not know to what influences he might be subjected, and so he got started in a new business.  Whether he would have fulfilled his employer's prediction, and some day been at the head of a saltery of his own, we can not tell; but in time he became dissatisfied with his situation, and returning home, waited for Providence to indicate some new path on which to enter.  One thing, however, was certain: he would not be content to remain long without employment. He had an active temperament, and would have been happiest when busy, even if he had not known that his mother needed the fruits of his labor.  He had one source of enjoyment while employed by the black-salter, which he fully appreciated. Strange to say, his employer had a library, that is, he had a small collection of books, gathered by his daughter, prominent among which were Marryatt's novels, and \"Sinbad the Sailor.\" They opened a new world to his young accountant, and gave him an intense desire to see the world, and especially to cross the great sea, even in the capacity of a sailor. At home there was no library, not from the lack of literary taste, but because there was no money to spend for anything but necessaries.  He had not been long at home when a neighbor, entering one day, said, \"James, do you want a job?\"  \"Yes,\" answered James, eagerly.  \"There's a farmer in Newburg wants some wood chopped.\"  \"I can do it,\" said James, quietly.  \"Then you'd better go and see him.\"  Newburg is within the present limits of Cleveland, and thither James betook himself the next day.  He was a stout boy, with the broad shoulders and sturdy frame of his former ancestors, and he was sure he could give satisfaction.  The farmer, dressed in homespun, looked up as the boy approached.  \"Are you Mr. ----?\" asked James.  \"Yes.\"  \"I heard that you wanted some wood chopped.\"  \"Yes, but I am not sure if you can do it,\" answered the farmer, surveying the boy critically.  \"I can do it,\" said James, confidently.  \"Very well, you can try. I'll give you seven dollars for the job.\"  The price was probably satisfactory, for James engaged to do the work. There proved to be twenty-five cords, and no one, I think, will consider that he was overpaid for his labor.  He was fortunate, at least, in the scene of his labor, for it was on the shore of Lake Erie, and as he lifted his eyes from his work they rested on the broad bosom of the beautiful lake, almost broad enough as it appeared to be the ocean itself, which he had a strange desire to traverse in search of the unknown lands of which he had read or dreamed.  I suppose there are few boys who have not at some time fancied that they should like \"a life on the ocean wave, and a home on the rolling deep.\" I have in mind a friend, now a physician, who at the age of fifteen left a luxurious home, with the reluctant permission of his parents, for a voyage before the mast to Liverpool, beguiled by one of the fascinating narratives of Herman Melville. But the romance very soon wore off, and by the time the boy reached Halifax, where the ship put in, he was so seasick, and so sick of the sea, that he begged to be"]]]
