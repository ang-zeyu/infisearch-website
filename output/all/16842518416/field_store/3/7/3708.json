Where did you get it, Bobby?\"  \"Never mind it now, mother.\"  Mr. Hardhand's covetous soul had already grasped the glittering gold; and removing his hand from the latch string, he approached the widow.  \"I shall be able to pay you forty dollars now,\" said Mrs. Bright, taking the five dollars she had saved from her pocket.  \"Yes, marm.\"  Mr. Hardhand took the money, and seating himself at the table, indorsed the amount on the back of the note.  \"You owe me sixty more,\" said he, maliciously, as he returned the note to his pocket book.  \"It must be paid immediately.\"  \"You must not be hard with me now, when I have paid more than you demanded.\"  \"I don't wish to come here again.  That boy's impudence has put me all out of conceit with you and your family,\" replied Mr. Hardhand, assuming the most benevolent look he could command.  \"There was a time when I was very willing to help you.  I have waited a great while for my pay for this house; a great deal longer than I would have waited for anybody else.\"  \"Your interest has always been paid punctually,\" suggested the widow, modestly.  \"That's true; but very few people would have waited as long as I have for the principal.  I wanted to help you--\"  \"By gracious!\" exclaimed Bobby, interrupting him.  \"Don't be saucy, my son, don't,\" said Mrs. Bright, fearing a repetition of the former scene.  \"_He_ wanted to help us!\" ejaculated Bobby.  It was a very absurd and hypocritical expression on the part of Mr. Hardhand; for he never wanted to help any one but himself; and during the whole period of his relations with the poor widow, he had oppressed, insulted, and abused her to the extent of his capacity, or at least as far as his interest would permit.  He was a malicious and revengeful man.  He did not consider the great provocation he had given Bobby for his violent conduct, but determined to be revenged, if it could be accomplished without losing any part of the sixty dollars still due him.  He was a wicked man at heart, and would not scruple to turn the widow and her family out of house and home.  Mrs. Bright knew this, and Bobby knew it too; and they felt very uneasy about it.  The wretch still had the power to injure them, and he would use it without compunction.  \"Yes, young man, I wanted to help you, and you see what I get for it--contempt and insults!  You will hear from me again in a day or two. Perhaps you will change your tune, you young reprobate!\"  \"Perhaps I shall,\" replied Bobby, without much discretion.  \"And you too, marm; you uphold him in his treatment of me.  You have not done your duty to him.  You have been remiss, marm!\" continued Mr. Hardhand, growing bolder again, as he felt the power he wielded.  \"That will do, sir; you can go!\" said Bobby, springing from his chair, and approaching Mr. Hardhand.  \"Go, and do your worst!\"  \"Humph! you stump me--do you?\"  \"I would rather see my mother kicked out of the house than insulted by such a dried-up old curmudgeon as you are.  Go along!\"  \"Now, don't, Bobby,\" pleaded his mother.  \"I am going; and if the money is not paid by twelve o'clock to-morrow, the law shall lake its course;\" and Mr. Hardhand rushed out of the house, slamming the door violently after him.  \"O Bobby, what have you done?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bright, when the hard-hearted creditor had departed.  \"I could not help it, mother; don't cry.  I cannot bear to hear you insulted and abused; and I thought when I heard him do it a year ago, that I couldn't stand it again.  It is too bad.\"  \"But he will turn us out of the house; and what shall we do then?\"  \"Don't cry, mother; it will come round all right.  I have friends who are rich and powerful, and who will help us.\"  \"You don't know what you say, Bobby.  Sixty dollars is a great deal of money, and if we should sell all we have, it would scarcely bring that.\"  \"Leave it all to me, mother; I feel as though I could do something now. I am old enough to make money.\"  \"What can you do?\"  \"Now or never!\" replied Bobby, whose mind had wandered from the scene to the busy world, where fortunes are made and lost every day.  \"Now or never!\" muttered he again.  \"But Bobby, you have not told me where you got all that gold.\"  \"Dinner is ready, I see, and I will tell you while we eat.\"  Bobby had been a fishing, and to be hungry is a part of the fisherman's luck; so he seated himself at the table, and gave his mother a full account of all that had occurred at the bridge.  The fond mother trembled when she realized the peril her son had incurred for the sake of the young lady; but her maternal heart swelled with admiration in view of the generous deed, and she thanked God that she was the mother of such a son.  She felt more confidence in him then than she had ever felt before, and she realized that he would be the stay and the staff of her declining years.  Bobby finished his dinner, and seated himself on the front door step. His mind was absorbed, by a new and brilliant idea; and for half an hour he kept up a most tremendous thinking.  \"Now or never!\" said he, as he rose and walked down the road towards Riverdale Centre.     CHAPTER V.  IN WHICH BOBBY GIVES HIS NOTE FOR SIXTY DOLLARS.  A great idea was born in Bobby's brain.  His mother's weakness and the insecurity of her position were more apparent to him than they had ever been before.  She was in the power of her creditor, who might turn her out of the little black house, sell the place at auction, and thus, perhaps, deprive her of the whole or a large part of his father's and her own hard earnings.  But this was not the peculiar hardship of her situation, as her devoted son understood it.  It was not the hard work alone which she was called upon to perform, not the coarseness of the fare upon which they lived, not the danger even of being turned out of doors, that distressed Bobby; it was that a wretch like Mr. Hardhand could insult and trample upon his mother.  He had just heard him use language to her that made his blood boil with indignation, and he did not, on cool, sober, second thought, regret that he had taken such a decided stand against it.  He cared not for himself.  He could live on a crust of bread and a cup of water from the spring; he could sleep in a barn; he could wear coarse and even ragged clothes; but he could not submit to have his mother insulted, and by such a mean and contemptible person as Mr. Hardhand.  Yet what could he do?  He was but a boy, and the great world would look with contempt upon his puny form.  But he felt that he was not altogether insignificant.  He had performed an act, that day, which the fair young lady, to whom he had rendered the service, had declared very few men would have undertaken.  There was something in him, something that would come out, if he only put his best foot forward.  It was a tower of strength within him.  It told him that he could do wonders; that he could go out into the world and accomplish all that would be required to free his mother from debt, and relieve her from the severe drudgery of her life.  A great many people think they can \"do wonders.\"  The vanity of some very silly people makes them think they can command armies, govern nations, and teach the world what the world never knew before, and never would know but for them.  But Bobby's something within him was not vanity.  It was something more substantial.  He was not thinking of becoming a great man, a great general, a great ruler, or a great statesman; not even of making a great fortune.  Self was not the idol and the end of his calculations.  He was thinking of his mother, and only of her; and the feeling within him was as pure, and holy, and beautiful as the dream of an angel.  He wanted to save his mother from insult in the first place, and from a life of ceaseless drudgery in the second.  A legion of angels seemed to have encamped in his soul to give him strength for the great purpose in his mind.  His was a holy and a true purpose, and it was this that made him think he could \"do wonders.\" What Bobby intended to do the reader shall know in due time.  It is enough now that he meant to do something.  The difficulty with a great many people is, that they never resolve to do something.  They wait for \"something to turn up;\" and as \"things\" are often very obstinate, they utterly refuse to \"turn up\" at all.  Their lives are spent in waiting for a golden opportunity which never comes.  Now, Bobby Bright repudiated the Micawber philosophy.  He would have nothing to do with it.  He did not believe corn would grow without being planted, or that pouts would bite the bare hook.  I am not going to tell my young readers now how Bobby made out in the end; but I can confidently say that, if he had waited for \"something to turn up,\" he would have become a vagabond, a loafer, out of money, out at the elbows, and out of patience with himself and all the world.  It was \"now or never\" with Bobby.  He meant to do something; and after he had made up his mind how and where it was to be done, it was no use to stand thinking about it, like the pendulum of the \"old clock which had stood for fifty years in a farmer's kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of complaint.\"  Bobby walked down the road towards the village with a rapid step.  He was thinking very fast, and probably that made him step quick.  But as he approached Squire Lee's house, his pace slackened, and he seemed to be very uneasy.  When he reached the great gate that led up to the house, he stopped for an instant, and thrust his hands down very deep into his trousers pockets.  I cannot tell what the trousers pockets had to do with what he was thinking about; but if he was searching for any thing in them, he did not find it; for after an instant's hesitation he drew out his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14762"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright: A Story for Young Folks (#5)"],["body","hands, struck one of them against his chest, and in an audible voice exclaimed,--  \"Now or never.\"  All this pantomime, I suppose, meant that Bobby had some misgivings as to the ultimate success of his mission at Squire Lee's, and that when he struck his breast and uttered his favorite expression, they were conquered and driven out.  Marching with a bold and determined step up to the squire's back door--Bobby's idea of etiquette would not have answered for the meridian of fashionable society--he gave three smart raps.  Bobby's heart beat a little wildly as he waited a response to his summons.  It seemed that he still had some doubts as to the practicability of his mission; but they were not permitted to disturb him long, for the door was opened by the Squire's pretty daughter Annie, a young miss of twelve.  \"O Bobby, is it you?  I am so glad you have come!\" exclaimed the little lady.  Bobby blushed--he didn't know why, unless it was that the young lady desired to see him.  He stammered out a reply, and for the moment forgot the object of his visit.  \"I want you to go down to the village for me, and get some books the expressman was to bring up from Boston for me.  Will you go?\"  \"Certainly, Miss Annie, I shall be very glad to go for _you_,\" replied Bobby with an emphasis that made the little maiden blush in her turn.  \"You are real good, Bobby; but I will give you something for going.\"  \"I don't want any thing,\" said Bobby, stoutly.  \"You are too generous!  Ah, I heard what you did this forenoon; and pa says that a great many men would not have dared to do what you did.  I always thought you were as brave as a lion; now I know it.\"  \"The books are at the express office, I suppose,\" said Bobby, turning as red as a blood beet.  \"Yes, Bobby; I am so anxious to get them that I can't wait till pa goes down this evening.\"  \"I will not be gone long.\"  \"O, you needn't run, Bobby; take your time.\"  \"I will go very quick.  But, Miss Annie, is your father at home?\"  \"Not now; he has gone over to the wood lot; but he will be back by the time you return.\"  \"Will you please to tell him that I want to see him about something very particular, when he gets back?\"  \"I will, Bobby.\"  \"Thank you, Miss Annie;\" and Bobby hastened to the village to execute his commission.  \"I wonder what he wants to see pa so very particularly for,\" said the young lady to herself, as she watched his receding form.  \"In my opinion, something has happened, at the little black house, for I could see that he looked very sober.\"  Either Bobby had a very great regard for the young lady, and wished to relieve her impatience to behold the coveted books, or he was in a hurry to see Squire Lee; for the squire's old roan horse could hardly have gone quicker.  \"You should not have run, Bobby,\" said the little maiden when he placed the books in her hand; \"I would not have asked you to go if I had thought you would run all the way.  You must be very tired.\"  \"Not at all; I didn't run, only walked very quick,\" replied he; but his quick breathing indicated that his words or his walk had been very much exaggerated.  \"Has your father returned?\"  \"He has; he is waiting for you in the sitting room.  Come in, Bobby.\"  Bobby followed her into the room, and took the chair which Annie offered him.  \"How do you do, Bobby?  I am glad to see you,\" said the squire, taking him by the hand, and bestowing a benignant smile upon him--a smile which cheered his heart more than any thing else could at that moment. \"I have heard of you before to-day.\"  \"Have you?\"  \"I have, Bobby; you are a brave little fellow.\"  \"I came over to see you, sir, about something very particular,\" replied Bobby, whose natural modesty induced him to change the topic.  \"Indeed; well, what can I do for you?\"  \"A great deal, sir; perhaps you will think I am very bold, sir, but I can't help it.\"  \"I know you are a very bold little fellow, or you would not have done what you did this forenoon,\" laughed the squire.  \"I didn't mean that, sir,\" answered Bobby, blushing up to the eyes.  \"I know you didn't; but go on.\"  \"I only meant that you would think me presuming, or impudent, or something of that kind.\"  \"O, no, far from it.  You cannot be presuming or impudent.  Speak out, Bobby; any thing under the heavens that I can do for you, I shall be glad to do.\"  \"Well, sir, I am going to leave Riverdale.\"  \"Leave Riverdale!\"  \"Yes, sir; I am going to Boston, where I mean to do something to help mother.\"  \"Bravo! you are a good lad.  What do you mean to do?\"  \"I was thinking I should go into the book business.\"  \"Indeed!\" and Squire Lee was much amused by the matter-of-fact manner of the young aspirant.  \"I was talking with a young fellow who went through the place last spring, selling books.  He told me that some days he made three or four dollars, and that he averaged twelve dollars a week.\"  \"He did well; perhaps, though, only a few of them make so much.\"  \"I know I can make twelve dollars a week,\" replied Bobby, confidently, for that something within him made him feel capable of great things.  \"I dare say you can.  You have energy and perseverance, and people take a liking to you.\"  \"But I wanted to see you about another matter.  To speak out at once, I want to borrow sixty dollars of you;\" and Bobby blushed, and seemed very much embarrassed by his own boldness.  \"Sixty dollars!\" exclaimed the squire.  \"I knew you would think me impudent,\" replied our hero, his heart sinking within him.  \"But I don't, Bobby.  You want this money to go into business with--to buy your stock of books?\"  \"O, no, sir; I am going to apply to Mr. Bayard for that.\"  \"Just so; Mr. Bayard is the gentleman whose daughter you saved?\"  \"Yes, sir.  I want this money to pay off Mr. Hardhand.  We owe him but sixty dollars now, and he has threatened to turn us out, if it is not paid by tomorrow noon.\"  \"The old hunks!\"  Bobby briefly related to the squire the events or the morning, much to the indignation and disgust of the honest, kind-hearted man.  The courageous boy detailed more clearly his purpose, and doubted not he should be able to pay the loan in a few months.  \"Very well, Bobby, here is the money;\" and the squire took it from his wallet, and gave it to him.  \"Thank you, sir.  May Heaven bless you!  I shall certainly pay you.\"  \"Don't worry about it, Bobby.  Pay it when you get ready.\"  \"I will give you my note, and--\"  The squire laughed heartily at this, and told him, that, as he was a minor, his note was not good for any thing.  \"You shall see whether it is, or not,\" returned Bobby.  \"Let me give it to you, at least, so that we can tell how much I owe you from time to time.\"  \"You shall have your own way.\"  Annie Lee, as much amused as her father at Bobby's big talk, got the writing materials, and the little merchant in embryo wrote and signed the note.  \"Good, Bobby!  Now promise that you will come and see me every time you come home, and tell me how you are getting along.\"  \"I will, sir, with the greatest pleasure;\" and with a light heart Bobby tripped away home.     CHAPTER VI.  IN WHICH BOBBY SETS OUT ON HIS TRAVELS.  Squire Lee, though only a plain farmer, was the richest man in Riverdale.  He had taken a great fancy to Bobby, and often employed him to do errands, ride the horse to plough in the cornfields, and such chores about the place as a boy could do.  He liked to talk with Bobby because there was a great deal of good sense in him, for one with a small head.  If there was any one thing upon which the squire particularly prided himself, it was his knowledge of human nature.  He declared that he only wanted to look a man in the face to know what he was; and as for Bobby Bright, he had summered him and wintered him, and he was satisfied that he would make something in good time.  He was not much astonished when Bobby opened his ambitious scheme of going into business for himself.  But he had full faith in his ability to work out a useful and profitable, if not a brilliant life.  He often said that Bobby was worth his weight in gold, and that he would trust him with any thing he had.  Perhaps he did not suspect that the time was at hand when he would be called upon to verify his words practically; for it was only that morning, when one of the neighbors told him about Bobby's stopping the horse, that he had repeated the expression for the twentieth time.  It was not an idle remark.  Sixty dollars was hardly worth mentioning with a man of his wealth and liberal views, though so careful a man as he was would not have been likely to throw away that amount.  But as a matter of investment,--Bobby had made the note read \"with interest,\"--he would as readily have let him have it, as the next richest man in the place, so much confidence had he in our hero's integrity, and so sure was he that he would soon have the means of paying him.  Bobby was overjoyed at the fortunate issue of his mission, and he walked into the room where his mother was closing shoes, with a dignity worthy a banker or a great merchant.  Mrs. Bright was very sad. Perhaps she felt a little grieved that her son, whom she loved so much, had so thoughtlessly plunged her into a new difficulty.  \"Come, cheer up, mother; it is all right,\" said Bobby in his usual elastic and gay tones; and at the same time he took the sixty dollars from his pocket and handed it to her.  \"There is the money, and you will be forever quit of Mr. Hardhand to-morrow.\"  \"What, Bobby!  Why, where did you get all this money?\" asked Mrs. Bright, utterly astonished.  In a few words the ambitious boy told his story, and then informed his mother that he was going to Boston the next Monday morning, to commence business for himself.  \"Why, what can you do, Bobby?\"  \"Do?  I can do a great many things;\" and he unfolded his scheme of becoming a little book merchant.  \"You are a courageous fellow!  Who would have thought of such a thing?\"  \"I should, and did.\"  \"But you are not old enough.\"  \"O, yes, I am.\"  \""]]]
