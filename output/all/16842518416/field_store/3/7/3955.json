From her feet perfect lawns sloped down to a gracious waterway, which shuddered occasionally in a gentle wind; on every side pleasing trees were massed into shady and grateful woods; overhead the noonday sun lit up a deep-blue sky. Perhaps the sublimity of the scene played upon her softer emotions. Perhaps all intense beauty is pathetic, and makes one think of poor illusions and unavailing dreams. Lady Gray wondered why she could not feel, on this serene morning, the same confidence in Edgar Doe's future, as her friend felt in Archie's; why she should rather be conscious of a romantic foreboding. But she only murmured:  \"Yes, we must bow before sovereign youth.\"  And that was the last word uttered, till the sound of hearty boys' voices, coming from the trunks of the trees, prompted Mrs. Pennybet to say cheerfully:  \"Here they come, the heirs to the world.\"  As she spoke, Archie Pennybet, dark and dictatorial, and Edgar Doe, fair and enthusiastic, came into view.  \"Yes,\" replied Lady Gray, \"but only two of them. There are others they must share it with. Shall we go indoors?\"  And indoors or out-of-doors, that was a very delightful day spent at Graysroof. And, when the sun's rays began to grow ruddy, there came the pleasant journey down the Estuary to Falmouth Town. Mrs. Pennybet and her son were rowed homeward by Baptist, that sombre boatman employed at Graysroof, in Master Doe's own particular boat. \"_The Lady Fal_,\" men called it, from the dainty conceit that it was the spouse of the lordly Estuary. Edgar Doe accompanied them, as the master of his craft.  Nobody talked much during the voyage. Baptist was always too solemn for speech. Master Doe, on these occasions, liked to dream with one hand trailing in the water. Master Pennybet, in the common way of tired children, finished the day in listless woolgathering. And his mother, recalling the conversation in the stately garden up the stream, fell to wondering whither these boys were tending.  So the passage down the full and slumbery Fal seemed nearly a soundless thing. But all the real river-noises were there; the birds were singing endlessly in the groves; the gulls with their hoarse language were flying seawards from the mud-flats of Truro; the water was gently lapping the sides of the boat; and voices could be heard from the distances higher up and lower down the stream. And behind all this prattle of the Estuary hung the murmur of the sea.  It was a very quiet boat that unladed the Pennybets on the steps of a stone pier at Falmouth, and then swung round and carried Edgar up its own wake. Baptist was a glorious hand with the paddles, and, as the _Lady Fal_ swept easily over the glassy water, Edgar gazed at the familiar things coming into view. There, at last, was the huge house of Graysroof, belittled by the loftiness of the quilted hill, on whose slope it stood, and by the extent of its surrounding woods. And there in the water lay mirrored a reflection of house and trees and hillside. Baptist rested on his oars, and, turning round on his seat, drank in the loveliness of England and the Fal. His oars remained motionless for a long time, till he suddenly commented:  \"H'm.\"  This encouraging remark Master Doe interpreted as a willingness to converse, and he let escape a burst of confidence.  \"You know, I like Archie Pennybet very much indeed. In fack, I think I like him better than anyone else in the world, 'septing of course my relations.\"  Watching his hearer nervously to see how he would receive this important avowal, Master Doe flushed when he saw no signs of emotion on Baptist's countenance. He didn't like thinking he had made himself look a fool. Probably Baptist perceived this, for he felt he must contrive a reply, and, abandoning \"H'm\" as too uncouth and too unflavoured with sympathy, gave of his best, muttering:  \"Ah, he's one of we.\"  Then, realising that the sun had gone in a blaze of glory, and that he must waste no further time in prolonged gossip, he dipped his blade into the still water, and turned the head of the boat for the Graysroof bank; and for the things that should be.    BOOK I FIVE GAY YEARS OF SCHOOL   _Part I: Tidal Reaches_   CHAPTER I  RUPERT RAY BEGINS HIS STORY   ยง1  \"I'm the best-looking person in this room,\" said Archibald Pennybet. \"Ray's face looks as though somebody had trodden on it, and Doe's--well, Doe's would be better if it had been trodden on.\"  It was an early morning of the Kensingtowe Summer Term, and the three of us, Archie Pennybet, Edgar Gray Doe, and I, Rupert Ray, were waiting in the Junior Preparation Room at Bramhall House, till the bell should summon us over the playing fields to morning school. Kensingtowe, of course, is the finest school in England, and Bramhall its best house. Now, Pennybet, though not himself courteous, always insisted that Doe and I should treat him with proper respect, so, since he was senior and thus magnificent, I'll begin by describing him.  He was right in saying that he was the handsomest. He was a tall boy of fifteen years, with long limbs that were saved from any unlovely slimness by their full-fleshed curves and perfect straightness. His face, whose skin was as smooth as that of a bathed and anointed Greek, was crowned by dark hair, and made striking by a pair of those long-lashed eyes that are always brown. And in character he was the most remarkable. Though two years our senior, he deliberately lagged behind the boys of his own age, and remained the oldest member of our form. Thoughtless masters called him a dunce, but abler ones knew him to be only idle. And Pennybet cared little for either opinion. He had schemed to remain in a low form; and that was enough. It was better to be a field-marshal among the \"kids\" than a ranker among his peers. Like Satan, for whom he probably felt a certain admiration, he found it better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.  The personal attendants of this splendid sultan consisted of Edgar Doe and myself. We were not allowed by him to forget that, if he could total fifteen years, we could only scrape together a bare thirteen. We were mere children. Doe and I, being thirteen and an exact number of days, were twins, or we would have been, had it not been for the divergence of our parentage. We often expressed a wish that this divergence were capable of remedy. It involved minor differences. For instance, while Doe's eyes were brown, mine were blue; and while Doe's hair was very fair, mine was a tedious drab that had once been gold. Moreover, in place of my wide mouth, Doe possessed lips that were always parted like those of a pretty girl. Indeed, if Archie Pennybet was the handsomest of us three, it is certain that Edgar Gray Doe was the prettiest.  We came to be discussing our looks this morning, because Pennybet, having discovered that among other accomplishments he was a fine ethnologist, was about to determine the race and tribe of each of us by an examination of our features and colouring.  \"I'm a Norman,\" he decided, and threw himself back on his chair, putting his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat, as though that were a comely Norman attitude, \"a pure Norman, but I don't know how my hair got so dark, and my eyes such a spiffing brown.\"  \"What am I?\" I interrupted, as introducing a subject of more immediate interest.  \"You, Ray? Oh, you're a Saxon. Your name's Rupert, you see, and you've blue eyes and a fair skin, and all that rot.\"  I was quite satisfied with being a pure Saxon, and left Doe to his examination.  \"What am I?\" he eagerly asked, offering his oval face and parted lips for scrutiny.  \"You? Oh, Saxon, with a dash of Southern blood. Brown eyes, you see, and that sloppy milk-and-coffee skin. And there's a dash of Viking in you--that's your fair hair. Adulterated Saxon you are.\"  At this Doe loudly protested that he was a pure Saxon, a perfect Cornish Saxon from the banks of the Fal.  Penny always discouraged precocious criticism, so he replied:  \"I'm not arguing with you, my child.\"  \"_You?_ Who are you?\"  Penny let his thumbs go further into his armholes, and assured us with majestic suavity:  \"I? I'm _Me_.\"  \"No, you're not,\" snapped Doe. \"You're not me. I'm me.\"  \"Well, you're neither of you me,\" interrupted the third fool in the room. \"I'm me. So sucks!\"  \"Now you two boys,\" began our stately patron, \"don't you begin dictating to _me_. Once and for all, Doe is Doe, Ray is Ray, and I'm Me. Why, by Jove! Doe-Ray-Me! It's a joke; and I'm a gifted person.\"  This discovery of the adaptability of our names was so startling that I exclaimed:  \"Good Lord! How mad!\"  Penny only shrugged his shoulders, and generally plumed himself on his little success. And Doe said:  \"Has that only just dawned on you?\"  \"Observe,\" sneered Penny. \"The Gray Doe is jealous. He would like the fame of having made this fine jest. So he pretends he thought of it long ago. He bags it.\"  \"Not worth bagging,\" suggested Doe, who was pulling a lock of his pale hair over his forehead, and trying with elevated eye-brows to survey it critically. His feet were resting on a seat in front of him, and his trousers were well pulled up, so as to show a certain tract of decent sock. Penny scanned him as though his very appearance were nauseating.  \"Well, why did you bag it?\"  \"I didn't.\"  \"I say, you're a bit of a liar, aren't you?\"  \"Well, if I'm a bit of a liar, you're a lot of one.\"  \"My dear little boy,\" said Penny, with intent to hurt, \"we all know the reputation for lying you had at your last school.\"  As we had all been at Kensingtowe's Preparatory School together, I was in a position to know that this was rather wild, and remonstrated with him.  \"I say, that's a bit sticky, isn't it?\"  The nobility of my interference impressed me as I made it. Meanwhile the angry blood mounted to Doe's face, but he carelessly replied:  \"You show what a horrible liar you are by your last remark. I never said your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15033"],["title","Tell England (#4)"],["body","idea was mine; and because you accused me of doing so, and I said I didn't, you call me a liar: which is a dirty lie, if you like. But of course one expects lies from you.\"  \"That may be,\" rejoined Pennybet. \"But you know you don't wash.\"  Doe parried this thrust with a sarcastic acquiescence.  \"No, I know I don't--never did--don't believe in washing.\"  Now Penny was out to hurt. A mere youngster had presumed to argue and be cheeky with him: and discipline must be maintained. To this end there must be punishment; and punishment, to be effective, must hurt. So he adopted a new line, and with his clever strategy strove to enlist my support by deigning to couple my name with his.  \"At any rate,\" he drawled, \"Ray and I don't toady to Radley.\"  This poisonous little remark requires some explanation. Mr. Radley, the assistant house-master at Bramhall House, was a hard master, who would have been hated for his insufferable conceptions of discipline, had he not been the finest bat in the Middlesex team. Just about this time there was a libel current that he made a favourite of Edgar Doe because he was pretty. \"Doe,\" I had once said, \"Radley's rather keen on you, isn't he?\" And Doe had turned red and scoffed: \"How absolutely silly--but, I say, do you really think so?\" Seeing that he found pleasure in the insinuation, I had followed it up with chaff, upon which he had suddenly cut up rough, and left me in a pique.  This morning, as Penny pricked him with this poisoned fang, Doe began to feel that for the moment he was alone amongst us three; and odd-man-out. He put a tentative question to me, designed to see whether I were siding with him or with the foe.  \"Now, Ray, isn't that the dirtiest lie he's told so far?\"  \"No,\" I said. I was still under the glamour of having been appealed to by the forceful personality of Pennybet; and, besides, it certainly wasn't.  \"Oh, of course you'd agree with anything Penny said, if he asked you to. But you know you don't really believe I ever sucked up to Radley.\"  This rejoinder was bad tactics, for by its blow at my face it forced me to take sides against him in the quarrel. So I answered:  \"Rather! Why, you always do.\"  \"Dir-dirty liar!\"  \"Ha-ha!\" laughed Penny. He saw that he had been successful in his latest thrust, and set himself to push home the advantage. The dominance of his position must be secured at all costs. He let down his heavy-lashed eyelids, as though, for his part, he only desired a peaceful sleep, and said: \"Ha-ha! Ray, that friend of yours is losing his temper. He's terribly vicious. Mind he doesn't scratch.\"  Doe's parted lips came suddenly together, his face got red, and he moved impatiently as he sat. But he said nothing, either because the words would not come, or lest something more unmanly should.  \"Ray,\" pursued the tormentor, \"I think that friend of yours is going to blub.\"  Doe left his seat, and stood upon his feet, his lips set in one firm line. He tossed his hair off his forehead, and, keeping his face averted from our gaze lest we should detect any moisture about the eyes, opened a desk, and selected the books he would require. They were books over which he had scrawled with flourishes:            \"Mr. Edgar Gray Doe, Esq.,\"           \"E. Gray Doe, M.A.,\"           \"Rev. Edgar G. Doe, D.D.,\"           \"E. G. Doe, Physician and Surgeon,\"  and, when he had placed them on his arm, he walked towards the door with his face still turned away from us.  \"Oh, don't go, Doe. Don't be a sloppy ass,\" I said, feeling that I had been fairly trapped into deserting a fellow-victim, and backing our common tyrant.  My appeal Doe treated as though he had not heard it; and Penny, certain that his victory was won, and that he had no further need of my support, kicked it away with the sneer: \"Hit Doe, and Ray's bruised! What a David and Jonathan we're going to be! How we agree like steak and kidney!... Rather a nice expression, that.\"  Penny's commentary was thus turned inwards upon himself, in an affectionate criticism of his vocabulary, to show the utter detachment of his interest from the pathetic exit of Edgar Doe. For now Doe had reached the door, which he opened, passed, and slammed. In a twinkling I had opened it again, and was looking down the corridor. There was no sign of my friend anywhere. The moment he had slammed the door he must have run.  I returned to the preparation room, and Penny sighed, as much as to say: \"What a pity little boys are so petulant and quarrelsome.\" But the victory was his, as it always was, and he could think of other things. There was a clock on the wall behind him, but, too comfortable to turn his head, he asked me:  \"What's the beastly?\"  I glanced at the clock, and intimated, sulkily enough, that the beastly was twenty minutes past nine. He groaned.  \"Oh! Ah! An hour's sweat with Radley. Oh, hang! Blow! Damn!\"  He stood up, stretched himself, yawned, apologised, got his books, and occasionally tossed a remark to me, as if he were quite unaware that I was not only trying to sulk, but also badly wanted him to know it. As I looked for my books, I sought for the rudest and most painful insult I could offer him. My duty to Doe demanded that it should be something quite uncommon. And from a really fine selection I had just chosen: \"You're the biggest liar I've ever met, and, for all I know, you're as big a thief,\" when I turned round and found he was gone. Pennybet always left the field as its master.   ยง2  Within Radley's spacious class-room some twenty of us took our way to our desks. Radley mounted his low platform, and, resting his knuckles on his writing-table, gazed down upon us. He was a man of over six feet, with the shoulders, chest, and waist of a forcing batsman. His neck, perhaps, was a little too big, the fault of a powerful frame; and the wrist that came below his cuff was such that it made us wonder what was the size of his forearm. His mouth was hard, and set above a squaring chin, so that you thought him relentless, till his grey eyes shook your judgment.  \"Let me see,\" he said, as he stood, looking down upon us, \"you should come to me for both periods this morning. Well, I shall probably be away all the second period. You will come to this class-room as usual, and Herr Reinhardt will take you in French.\"  \"Oh, joy!\" I muttered. Boys whom Radley could not see flipped their fingers to express delight. Others lifted up the lids of their desks, and behind these screens went through a pantomime that suggested pleasure at good news. The fact was that the announcement that we were to have second period with the German, Reinhardt, was as good as promising us a holiday. Nay, it was rather better; for, in an unexpected holiday, we might have been at a loss what to do, whereas under Reinhardt we had no doubt--we played the fool.  \"And now get on with your work,\" concluded Radley.  We got on with it, knowing that it was only for a short time that we need work that morning.  It was writing work I know, for, after a while, I had a note surreptitiously passed to me between folded blotting-paper. The note bore in Doe's ambitiously ornate writing the alarming statement: \"I shall never like you so much after what you said this morning Yours Edgar Gray Doe.\" There was room for me to pen an answer, and in my great round characters I wrote: \"I never really meant anything and after you left I tried to be rude to Penny but he'd gone and will you still be my chum Yours S. Ray.\" (My real name was Rupert, but I was sometimes nicknamed \"Sonny Ray\" from the sensational news, which had leaked out, that my mother so called me, and I took pleasure in signing myself \"S. Ray.\") My handsome apology was passed back to the offended party, and in due course the paper returned to me, bearing his reply: \"I don't know We must talk it over, but don't tell anyone Yours Edgar Gray Doe.\" That was the last sentence destined to be written on this human document, for Radley, without looking up from the exercise he was correcting, said quietly:  \"In the space of the last five minutes Doe has twice corresponded with Ray, and Ray has once replied to Doe. Now both Ray and Doe will come up here with the letters.\"  To the accompaniment of a titter or two, Ray and Doe came up, I trying to look defiantly indifferent to the fact that he was going to read my silly remarks, and Doe with his lips firmly together, and his fair hair the fairer for the blush upon his forehead and cheeks.  Radley left us standing by his desk, while at his leisure he finished his correcting; then, still without looking up, he ordered:  \"Hand over the letters.\"  A little doggedly I passed over the single sheet of paper feeling some absurd satisfaction that, since he evidently thought there were several sheets involved, his uncanny knowledge was at least wrong in one particular. Doe, on my right hand, turned redder and redder to see the paper going beneath the master's eye, and made a few nervous grimaces. Radley read the correspondence pitilessly; and, with his hard mouth unrelaxed, turned first on Doe, as though sizing him up, and then on me. He stared at my face till I felt fidgety, and my mind, which always in moments of excitement ran down most ridiculous avenues, framed the sentence: \"Don't stare, because it's rude,\" at which involuntary thought I scarcely restrained a nervous titter. After this critical inspection, Radley murmured:  \"Yes, talk your quarrel over. The bands of friendship mustn't snap at a breath.\"  As he said this, Doe edged closer to me, and I wondered if Radley was a decent chap.  \"But why do you sign yourself 'S. Ray'?\"  Now my blush outclassed anything Doe had yet produced, and I looked in dumb confusion towards my friend. Radley refrained from forcing the question, but pursued with brutal humour:  \"Well, there's nothing like suffering together to cement a friendship. Doe, put out your knuckles.\"  Radley was ever a man of surprises. This was the first time he had invited the "]]]
