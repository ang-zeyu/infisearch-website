HYMN FOR THOSE WHO FAST     O Jesus, Light of Bethlehem,     True Son of God, Incarnate Word;   Thou offspring of a Virgin's womb,     Be present at our frugal board;   Accept our fast, our sacrifice,     And smile upon us, gracious Lord.    For by this holiest mystery     The inward parts are cleansed from stain,   And, taming all the unbridled lusts,     Our sinful flesh we thus restrain,   Lest gluttony and drunkenness     Should choke the soul and cloud the brain.    Hence appetite and luxury     Are forced their empire to resign;   The wanton sport, the jest obscene,     The ignoble sway of sleep and wine,   And all the plagues of languid sense     Feel the strict bonds of discipline.    For if, full fed with meat and drink,     The flesh thou ne'er dost mortify,   The mind, that spark of sacred flame,     By pleasure dulled, must fail and die,   And pent in its gross prison-house     The soul in shameful torpor lie.    So be thy carnal lusts controlled,     So be thy judgment clear and bright;   Then shall thy spirit, swift and free,     Be gifted with a keener sight,   And breathing in an ampler air     To the All-Father pray aright.    Elias by such abstinence,     Seer of the desert, grew in grace,   Who left the madding haunts of men     And found a peaceful resting-place,   Where, far from sinful crowds, he trod     The pure and silent wilderness.    Till by those fiery coursers drawn     The swift car bore him through the air,   Lest earth's defiling touch should mar     The holiness it might not share,   Or some polluting breath disturb     The peace attained by fast and prayer.    Moses, through whom from His dread throne     The will of God to man was told,   No food might touch till through the sky     The sun full forty times had rolled,   Ere God before him stood revealed,     Lord of the heavens sevenfold.    Tears were his meat, while bent in prayer     Through the long night he bowed his head   E'en to the thirsty dust, that drank     The drops in bitter weeping shed;   Till, at God's call, he saw the flame     No eye may bear, and was afraid.    The Baptist, too, was strong in fast--     Forerunner in a later day   Of God's Eternal Son--who made     The byepaths plain, the crooked way   A road direct, wherein His feet     Might travel on without delay.    This was the messenger's great task     Who for God's advent zealously   Prepared the way, the rough made smooth,     The mountain levelled to the sea;   That, when Truth came from heaven to earth,     All fair and straight His path should be.    He was not born in common wise,     For dry and wrinkled was the breast   Of her that bare him late in years,     Nor found she from her labour rest,   Till she had hailed with lips inspired     The Maid with unborn Godhead blest.    For him the hairy skins of beasts     Furnished a raiment rude and wild,   As forth into the lonely waste     He fared, an unbefriended child,   Who dwelt apart, lest he should be     By evil city-life defiled.    There, vowed to abstinence, he grew     To manhood, and with stern disdain   He turned from meat and drink, until     He saw night's shadow fall again;   And locusts and the wild bees' store     Sufficed his vigour to sustain.    The first was he to testify     Of that new life which man might win;   In Jordan's consecrating stream     He purged the stains of ancient sin,   And, as he made the body clean,     The radiant Spirit entered in.    Forth from the holy tide they came     Reborn, from guilt's pollution free,   As bright from out the cleansing fire     Flows the rough gold, or as we see   The glittering silver, purged of dross,     Flash into polished purity.    Now let us tell, from Holy Writ,     Of olden fasts the fairest crown;   How God in pity stayed His hand,     And spared a doomed and guilty town,   In clemency the flames withheld     And laid His vengeful lightnings down.    A mighty race of ancient time     Waxed arrogant in boastful pride;   Debauched were they, and borne along     On foul corruption's loathsome tide,   Till in their stiff-necked self-conceit     They e'en the God of Heaven denied.    At last Eternal Mercy turns     To righteous judgment, swift and dire;   He shakes the clouds; the mighty sword     Flames in His hand, and in His ire   He wields the roaring hurricane     'Mid murky gloom and flashing fire.    Yet in His clemency He grants     To penitence a brief delay,   That they might burst the bonds of lust     And put their vanities away;   His sentence given, He waits awhile     And stays the hand upraised to slay.    To warn them of the wrath to come     The Avenger in His mercy sent   Jonah the seer; but,--though he knew     The threatening Judge would fain relent   Nor wished to strike,--towards Tarshish town     The prophet's furtive course was bent.    As up the galley's side he climbed,     They loosed the dripping rope, and passed   The harbour bar: then on them burst     The sudden fury of the blast;   And when their peril's cause they sought,     The lot was on the recreant cast.    The man whose guilt the urn declares     Alone must die, the rest to save;   Hurled headlong from the deck, he falls     And sinks beneath the engulfing wave,   Then, seized by monstrous jaws, is plunged     Into a vast and living grave.         *       *       *       *       *    At last the monster hurls him forth,     As the third night had rolled away;   Before its roar the billows break     And lash the cliffs with briny spray;   Unhurt the wondering prophet stands     And hails the unexpected day.    Thus turned again to duty's path     To"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],["title","The Hymns of Prudentius (#8)"],["body","he swiftly came,   Their lusts rebuked and boldly preached     God's judgment on their sin and shame;   \"Believe!\" he cried, \"the Judge draws nigh     Whose wrath shall wrap your streets in flame.\"    Thence to the lofty mount withdrew,     Where he might watch the smoke-cloud lower   O'er blasted homes and ruined halls,     And rest beneath the shady bower   Upspringing in swift luxury     Of twining tendril, leaf and flower.    But when the guilty burghers heard     The impending doom, a dull despair   Possessed their souls; proud senators,     Poor craftsmen, throng the highways fair;   Pale youth with tottering age unites,     And women's wailing rends the air.    A public fast they now decree,     If they may thus Christ's anger stay:   No food they touch: each haughty dame     Puts silken robes and gems away,   In sable garbed, and ashes casts     Upon her tresses' disarray.    In dark and squalid vesture clad     The Fathers go: the mourning crowd   Dons rough attire: in shaggy skins     Enwrapped, fair maids their faces shroud   With dusky veils, and boyish heads     E'en to the very dust are bowed.    The King tears off his jewelled brooch     And rends the robe of Coan hue;   Bright emeralds and lustrous pearls     Are flung aside, and ashes strew   The royal head, discrowned and bent,     As low he kneels God's grace to sue.    None thought to drink, none thought to eat;     All from the table turned aside,   And in their cradles wet with tears     Starved babes in bitter anguish cried,   For e'en the foster-mother stern     To little lips the breast denied.    The very flocks are closely penned     By careful hands, lest they should gain   Sweet water from the babbling stream     Or wandering crop the dewy plain;   And bleating sheep and lowing kine     Within their barren stalls complain.    Moved by such penitence, full soon     God's grace repealed the stern decree   And curbed His righteous wrath; for aye,     When man repents, His clemency   Is swift to pardon and to hear     His children weeping bitterly.    Yet wherefore of that bygone race     Should we anew the story tell?   For Christ's pure soul by fasting long     The clogging bonds of flesh did quell;   He Whom the prophet's voice foretold     As GOD WITH US, Emmanuel.    Man's body--frail by nature's law     And bound by pleasure's easy chain--   He freed by virtue's strong restraint,     And gave it liberty again:   He broke the bonds of flesh, and Lust     Was driven from his old domain.    Deep in the inhospitable wild     For forty days He dwelt alone   Nor tasted food, till, thus prepared,     All human weakness overthrown   By fasting's power, His mortal frame     Rejoiced the spirit's sway to own.    The Adversary, marvelling     To see this creature of a day   Endure such toil, spent all his guile     To learn if God in human clay   Had come indeed; but soon rebuked     Behind His back fled shamed away.    Therefore let each with all his might     Follow the way the Master taught,   The law of consecrated life     Which Christ unto His servants brought;   Till, with the lusts of flesh subdued,     The spirit reigns o'er act and thought.    'Tis this our jealous foe abhors,     'Tis this the Lord of earth and sky   Approves; by this the soul is made     Thy holy altar, God Most High:   Faith stirs within the slumbering heart     And sin's corroding power must fly.    Swifter than water quenches fire,     Swifter than sunshine melts the snow,   Crushed out by soul-restoring fast     Vanish the sins that rankly grow,   If hand in hand with Abstinence     Sweet Charity doth ever go.    This too is Virtue's noble task,     To clothe the naked, and to feed   The destitute, with kindly care     To visit sufferers in their need;   For king and beggar each must bear     The lot by changeless Fate decreed.    Happy the man whose good right hand     Seeks but God's praise, and flings his gold   Broadcast, nor lets his left hand know     The gracious deed; for wealth untold   Shall crown him through eternal years     With usury an hundredfold.

HYMNUS POST IEIUNIUM     Christe servorum regimen tuorum,   mollibus qui nos moderans habenis   leniter frenas facilique septos             lege coerces:    ipse cum portans onus inpeditum           5   corporis duros tuleris labores,   maior exemplis famulos remisso             dogmate palpas.

Tantus aeterni favor est magistri,   doctor indulgens ita nos amico   lactat hortatu, levis obsequela ut             mulceat artus.                 20    Addit et, ne quis velit invenusto   sordidus cultu lacerare frontem,   sed decus vultus capitisque pexum             comat honorem.    Terge ieiunans, ait, omne corpus,        25   neve subducto faciem rubore   luteus tinguat color aut notetur             pallor in ore.    Rectius laeto tegimus pudore,   quidquid ad cultum Patris exhibemus:     30   cernit occultum Deus et latentem             munere donat.

Hisce pro donis tibi, fide pastor,   servitus quaenam poterit rependi?        50   nulla conpensant pretium salutis             vota precantum.    Quamlibet spreto sine more pastu   sponte confectos tenuemus artus,   teque contemptis epulis rogemus          55             nocte dieque;    Vincitur semper minor obsequentum   cura, nec munus genitoris aequat,   frangit et cratem luteam laboris             grandior usus.                 60    Ergo ne limum fragilem solutae   deserant vires et aquosus albis   humor in venis dominetur aegrum             corpus inervans,    Laxus ac liber modus abstinendi          65   ponitur cunctis, neque nos severus   terror inpellit, sua quemque cogit             velle potestas.

Adnuit dexter Deus et secundo   prosperat vultu, velut hoc salubre   fidimus nobis fore, quod dicatas         75             carpimus escas.

HYMN AFTER FASTING     O Christ, of all Thy servants Guide,     Mild is the yoke Thou mak'st us bear,   Leading us gently by Thy side         With gracious care.    Thy love took up our life's hard load     And spent in grievous toils its might:   Thy bond-slaves tread the easier road         Led by Thy light.    Nine hours have run their course away,     The sun sped three parts of its race:   And what remains of the short day         Fadeth apace.    The holy fast hath reached its end;     Our table now Thou loadest, Lord:   With all Thy gifts true gladness send         To grace our board.    Such is our Master's gentle sway,     So kind the teaching in His school,   That all find rest who will obey         His easy rule.    Thou would'st not have us scorn the grace     Of cleanliness and vesture fair:   Thou lovest not a soilèd face         And unkempt hair.    Let him that fasts, Thou saidst, be clean,     Nor lose health's fair and ruddy glow:   Let no wan sallowness be seen         Upon his brow.    'Tis better in glad modesty     Of our good works to shun display:   God sees what 'scapes our neighbour's eye         And will repay.    That Shepherd keen seeks one lost sheep     Sickly and weak, strayed from the fold,   Fleece torn with briers of thickets deep,         Foolishly bold.    He drives the wolves far from the track:     And found He brings on shoulders borne   To sunlit pen the wanderer back,         No more forlorn:    Yea, to the meads and grassy fields     The lamb restores, where no thorn balks,   No rough burrs tear, no thistle yields         Its bristling stalks:    But leaves of green herbs brightly glance     And in the grove the palm-trees dream,   And laurels shade the eddying dance         Of crystal stream.    For all these gifts, O Shepherd dear,     What service can I render Thee?   No grateful vows my debt shall clear         For love so free.    Though by self-chosen fasts severe     Our strength of limb we waste away:   Though, spurning food, we Thee revere     By night and day:    Yet our works never can o'ertake     Thy love or with Thy gifts compare:   Our toils this earthen vessel break,         The more we dare.    Therefore lest failing powers consume     Our fragile life and shrivelled veins   Pale 'neath the tyranny of rheum         And weakening pains:    Thou dost not rule perpetual Lent     For man, nor modest fare deny:   Fearless may each unto his bent         His wants supply.    Enough that all our acts by prayer     Be sanctified unto Thy will,   Whether we fast, or with due care         Our needs fulfil.    Then shall God bless us for our good     And lead us to our soul's true wealth;   For, if but consecrated, food         Shall bring us health.    O Lord, grant that our feast may spread     Marrow and strength throughout our flesh:   And may all Christly souls be fed         With vigour fresh.                            IX. HYMNUS OMNIS"]]]
