It is furnished with slat shutters to   both doors and windows. These shutters had been pulled off by the mob   and the volleys fired through the glass doors. The younger Mabrys,   father, mother and child, were asleep in the first room at the time.   Hannah Mabry and her old husband were sleeping in the next room. The old   couple occupied the same bed, and it is miraculous that the old man did   not share the fate of his spouse.    Officer Bitterwolf, who was one of the first on the scene, said that he   was about a block and a half away with Officers Fordyce and Sweeney.   There were about twenty shots fired, and the trio raced to the cottage.   They saw twenty or thirty men running down Rousseau Street. Chase was   given and the crowd turned toward the river and scattered into several   vacant lots in the neighborhood.    The volunteer police stationed at the Sixth Precinct had about five   blocks to run before they arrived. They also moved on the reports of the   firing, and in a remarkably short time the square was surrounded, but no   one could be taken. As they ran to the scene they were assailed on every   hand with vile epithets and the accusation of \"Nigger lovers.\"    Rousseau Street, where the cottage is situated, is a particularly dark   spot, and no doubt the members of the mob were well acquainted with the   neighborhood, for the officers said that they seemed to sink into the   earth, so completely and quickly did they disappear after they had   completed their work, which was complete with the firing of the volley.    Hannah Mabry was taken to the Charity Hospital in the ambulance, where   it was found on examination that she had been shot through the right   lung, and that the wound was a particularly serious one.    Her old husband was found in the little wrecked home well nigh   distracted with fear and grief. It was he who informed the police that   at the time of the assault the younger Mabrys occupied the front room.   As he ran about the little home as well as his feeble condition would   permit he severely lacerated his feet on the glass broken from the   windows and door. He was escorted to the Sixth Precinct station, where   he was properly cared for. He could not realize why his little family   had been so murderously attacked, and was inconsolable when his wife was   driven off in the ambulance piteously moaning in her pain.    The search for the perpetrators of the outrage was thorough, but both   police and armed force of citizens had only their own efforts to rely   on. The residents of the neighborhood were aroused by the firing, but   they would give no help in the search and did not appear in the least   concerned over the affair. Groups were on almost every doorstep, and   some of them even jeered in a quiet way at the men who were voluntarily   attempting to capture the members of the mob. Absolutely no information   could be had from any of them, and the whole affair had the appearance   of being the work of roughs who either lived in the vicinity, or their   friends.   +DEATH OF CHARLES+  Friday witnessed the final act in the bloody drama begun by the three police officers, Aucoin, Mora and Cantrelle. Betrayed into the hands of the police, Charles, who had already sent two of his would-be murderers to their death, made a last stand in a small building, 1210 Saratoga Street, and, still defying his pursuers, fought a mob of twenty thousand people, single-handed and alone, killing three more men, mortally wounding two more and seriously wounding nine others. Unable to get to him in his stronghold, the besiegers set fire to his house of refuge. While the building was burning Charles was shooting, and every crack of his death-dealing rifle added another victim to the price which he had placed upon his own life. Finally, when fire and smoke became too much for flesh and blood to stand, the long sought for fugitive appeared in the door, rifle in hand, to charge the countless guns that were drawn upon him. With a courage which was indescribable, he raised his gun to fire again, but this time it failed, for a hundred shots riddled his body, and he fell dead face fronting to the mob. This last scene in the terrible drama is thus described in the _Times-Democrat_ of July 26:    Early yesterday afternoon, at 3 o'clock or thereabouts, Police Sergeant   Gabriel Porteus was instructed by Chief Gaster to go to a house at No.   1210 Saratoga Street, and search it for the fugitive murderer, Robert   Charles. A private \"tip\" had been received at the headquarters that the   fiend was hiding somewhere on the premises.    Sergeant Porteus took with him Corporal John R. Lally and Officers   Zeigel and Essey. The house to which they were directed is a small,   double frame cottage, standing flush with Saratoga Street, near the   corner of Clio. It has two street entrances and two rooms on each side,   one in front and one in the rear. It belongs to the type of cheap little   dwellings commonly tenanted by Negroes.    Sergeant Porteus left Ziegel and Essey to guard the outside and went   with Corporal Lally to the rear house, where he found Jackson and his   wife in the large room on the left. What immediately ensued is only   known by the Negroes. They say the sergeant began to question them about   their lodgers and finally asked them whether they knew anything about   Robert Charles. They strenuously denied all knowledge of his   whereabouts.    The Negroes lied. At that very moment the hunted and desperate murderer   lay concealed not a dozen feet away. Near the rear, left-hand corner of   the room is a closet or pantry, about three feet deep, and perhaps eight   feet long. The door was open and Charles was crouching, Winchester in   hand, in the dark further end.    Near the closet door was a bucket of water, and Jackson says that   Sergeant Porteous walked toward it to get a drink. At the next moment a   shot rang out and the brave officer fell dead. Lally was shot directly   afterward. Exactly how and where will never be known, but the   probabilities are that the black fiend sent a bullet into him before he   recovered from his surprise at the sudden onslaught. Then the murderer   dashed out of the back door and disappeared.    The neighborhood was already agog with the tragic events of the two   preceding days, and the sound of the shots was a signal for wild and   instant excitement. In a few moments a crowd had gathered and people   were pouring in by the hundred from every point of the compass. Jackson   and his wife had fled and at first nobody knew what had happened, but   the surmise that Charles had recommenced his bloody work was on every   tongue and soon some of the bolder found their way to the house in the   rear. There the bleeding forms of the two policemen told the story.    Lally was still breathing, and a priest was sent for to administer the   last rites. Father Fitzgerald responded, and while he was bending over   the dying man the outside throng was rushing wildly through the   surrounding yards and passageways searching for the murderer. \"Where is   he?\" \"What has become of him?\" were the questions on every lip.    Suddenly the answer came in a shot from the room directly overhead. It   was fired through a window facing Saratoga Street, and the bullet struck   down a young man named Alfred J. Bloomfield, who was standing in the   narrow passage-way between the two houses. He fell on his knees and a   second bullet stretched him dead.    When he fled from the closet Charles took refuge in the upper story of   the house. There are four windows on that floor, two facing toward   Saratoga Street and two toward Rampart. The murderer kicked several   breaches in the frail central partition, so he could rush from side to   side, and like a trapped beast, prepared to make his last stand.    Nobody had dreamed that he was still in the house, and when Bloomfield   was shot there was a headlong stampede. It was some minutes before the   exact situation was understood. Then rifles and pistols began to speak,   and a hail of bullets poured against the blind frontage of the old   house. Every one hunted some coign of vantage, and many climbed to   adjacent roofs. Soon the glass of the four upper windows was shattered   by flying lead. The fusillade sounded like a battle, and the excitement   upon the streets was indescribable.    Throughout all this hideous uproar Charles seems to have retained a   certain diabolical coolness. He kept himself mostly out of sight, but   now and then he thrust the gleaming barrel of his rifle through one of   the shattered window panes and fired at his besiegers. He worked the   weapon with incredible rapidity, discharging from three to five   cartridges each time before leaping back to a place of safety. These   replies came from all four windows indiscriminately, and showed that he   was keeping a close watch in every direction. His wonderful marksmanship   never failed him for a moment, and when he missed it was always by the   narrowest margin only.    On the Rampart Street side of the house there are several sheds,   commanding an excellent range of the upper story. Detective Littleton,   Andrew Van Kuren of the Workhouse force and several others climbed upon   one of these and opened fire on the upper windows, shooting whenever   they could catch a glimpse of the assassin. Charles responded with his   rifle, and presently Van Kuren climbed down to find a better position.   He was crossing the end of the shed when he was killed.    Another of Charles's bullets found its billet in the body of Frank   Evans, an ex-member of the police force. He was on the Rampart Street   side firing whenever he had an opportunity. Officer J.W. Bofill and A.S.   Leclerc were also wounded in the fusillade.    While the events thus briefly outlined were transpiring time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],["title","Mob Rule in New Orleans (#5)"],["body","a-wing,   and the cooler headed in the crowd began to realize that some quick and   desperate expedient must be adopted to insure the capture of the fiend   and to avert what might be a still greater tragedy than any yet enacted.   For nearly two hours the desperate monster had held his besiegers at   bay, darkness would soon be at hand and no one could predict what might   occur if he made a dash for liberty in the dark.    At this critical juncture it was suggested that the house be fired. The   plan came as an inspiration, and was adopted as the only solution of the   situation. The wretched old rookery counted for nothing against the   possible continued sacrifice of human life, and steps were immediately   taken to apply the torch. The fire department had been summoned to the   scene soon after the shooting began; its officers were warned to be   ready to prevent a spread of the conflagration, and several men rushed   into the lower right-hand room and started a blaze in one corner.    They first fired an old mattress, and soon smoke was pouring out in   dense volumes. It filled the interior of the ramshackle structure, and   it was evident that the upper story would soon become untenable. An   interval of tense excitement followed, and all eyes were strained for a   glimpse of the murderer when he emerged.    Then came the thrilling climax. Smoked out of his den, the desperate   fiend descended the stairs and entered the lower room. Some say he   dashed into the yard, glaring around vainly for some avenue of escape;   but, however that may be, he was soon a few moments later moving about   behind the lower windows. A dozen shots were sent through the wall in   the hope of reaching him, but he escaped unscathed. Then suddenly the   door on the right was flung open and he dashed out. With head lowered   and rifle raised ready to fire on the instant, Charles dashed straight   for the rear door of the front cottage. To reach it he had to traverse a   little walk shaded by a vineclad arbor. In the back room, with a cocked   revolver in his hand, was Dr. C.A. Noiret, a young medical student, who   was aiding the citizens' posse. As he sprang through the door Charles   fired a shot, and the bullet whizzed past the doctor's head. Before it   could be repeated Noiret's pistol cracked and the murderer reeled,   turned half around and fell on his back. The doctor sent another ball   into his body as he struck the floor, and half a dozen men, swarming   into the room from the front, riddled the corpse with bullets.    Private Adolph Anderson of the Connell Rifles was the first man to   announce the death of the wretch. He rushed to the street door, shouted   the news to the crowd, and a moment later the bleeding body was dragged   to the pavement and made the target of a score of pistols. It was shot,   kicked and beaten almost out of semblance to humanity....    The limp dead body was dropped at the edge of the sidewalk and from   there dragged to the muddy roadway by half a hundred hands. There in the   road more shots were fired into the body. Corporal Trenchard, a   brother-in-law of Porteus, led the shooting into the inanimate clay.   With each shot there was a cheer for the work that had been done and   curses and imprecations on the inanimate mass of riddled flesh that was   once Robert Charles.    Cries of \"Burn him! Burn him!\" were heard from Clio Street all the way   to Erato Street, and it was with difficulty that the crowd was   restrained from totally destroying the wretched dead body. Some of those   who agitated burning even secured a large vessel of kerosene, which had   previously been brought to the scene for the purpose of firing Charles's   refuge, and for a time it looked as though this vengeance might be   wreaked on the body. The officers, however, restrained this move,   although they were powerless to prevent the stamping and kicking of the   body by the enraged crowd.    After the infuriated citizens had vented their spleen on the body of the   dead Negro it was loaded into the patrol wagon. The police raised the   body of the heavy black from the ground and literally chucked it into   the space on the floor of the wagon between the seats. They threw it   with a curse hissed more than uttered and born of the bitterness which   was rankling in their breasts at the thought of Charles having taken so   wantonly the lives of four of the best of their fellow-officers.    When the murderer's body landed in the wagon it fell in such a position   that the hideously mutilated head, kicked, stamped and crushed, hung   over the end.    As the wagon moved off, the followers, who were protesting against its   being carried off, declaring that it should be burned, poked and struck   it with sticks, beating it into such a condition that it was utterly   impossible to tell what the man ever looked like.    As the patrol wagon rushed through the rough street, jerking and   swaying from one side of the thoroughfare to the other, the gory,   mud-smeared head swayed and swung and jerked about in a sickening   manner, the dark blood dripping on the steps and spattering the body of   the wagon and the trousers of the policemen standing on the step.   +MOB BRUTALITY+  The brutality of the mob was further shown by the unspeakable cruelty with which it beat, shot and stabbed to death an unoffending colored man, name unknown, who happened to be walking on the street with no thought that he would be set upon and killed simply because he was a colored man. The _Times-Democrat_'s description of the outrage is as follows:    While the fight between the Negro desperado and the citizens was in   progress yesterday afternoon at Clio and Saratoga Streets another   tragedy was being enacted downtown in the French quarter, but it was a   very one-sided affair. The object of the white man's wrath was, of   course, a Negro, but, unlike Charles, he showed no fight, but tried to   escape from the furious mob which was pursuing him, and which finally   put an end to his existence in a most cruel manner.    The Negro, whom no one seemed to know--at any rate no one could be found   in the vicinity of the killing who could tell who he was--was walking   along the levee, as near as could be learned, when he was attacked by a   number of white longshoremen or screwmen. For what reason, if there was   any reason other than the fact that he was a Negro, could not be   learned, and immediately they pounced upon him he broke ground and   started on a desperate run for his life.    The hunted Negro started off the levee toward the French Vegetable   Market, changed his course out the sidewalk toward Gallatin Street. The   angry, yelling mob was close at his heels, and increasing steadily as   each block was traversed. At Gallatin Street he turned up that   thoroughfare, doubled back into North Peters Street and ran into the   rear of No. 1216 of that street, which is occupied by Chris Reuter as a   commission store and residence.    He rushed frantically through the place and out on to the gallery on the   Gallatin Street side. From this gallery he jumped to the street and fell   flat on his back on the sidewalk. Springing to his feet as soon as   possible, with a leaden, hail fired by the angry mob whistling about   him, he turned to his merciless pursuers in an appealing way, and,   throwing up one hand, told them not to shoot any more, that they could   take him as he was.    But the hail of lead continued, and the unfortunate Negro finally   dropped to the sidewalk, mortally wounded. The mob then rushed upon him,   still continuing the fusillade, and upon reaching his body a number of   Italians, who had joined the howling mob, reached down and stabbed him   in the back and buttock with big knives. Others fired shots into his   head until his teeth were shot out, three shots having been fired into   his mouth. There were bullet wounds all over his body.    Others who witnessed the affair declared that the man was fired at as he   was running up the stairs leading to the living apartments above the   store, and that after jumping to the sidewalk and being knocked down by   a bullet he jumped up and ran across the street, then ran back and tried   to get back into the commission store. The Italians, it is said, were   all drunk, and had been shooting firecrackers. Tiring of this, they   began shooting at Negroes, and when the unfortunate man who was killed   ran by they joined in the chase.    No one was arrested for the shooting, the neighborhood having been   deserted by the police, who were sent up to the place where Charles was   fighting so desperately. No one could or would give the names of any of   those who had participated in the chase and the killing, nor could any   one be found who knew who the Negro was. The patrol wagon was called and   the terribly mutilated body sent to the morgue and the coroner notified.    The murdered Negro was copper colored, about 5 feet 11 inches in height,   about 35 years of age, and was dressed in blue overalls and a brown   slouch hat. At 10:30 o'clock the vicinity of the French Market was very   quiet. Squads of special officers were patrolling the neighborhood, and   there did not seem to be any prospects of disorder.  During the entire time the mob held the city in its hands and went about holding up street cars and searching them, taking from them colored men to assault, shoot and kill, chasing colored men upon the public square, through alleys and into houses of anybody who would take them in, breaking into the homes of defenseless colored men and women and beating aged and decrepit men and women to death, the police and the legally constituted authorities showed plainly where their sympathies were, for in no case reported through the daily papers does there appear the arrest, trial and conviction of one of the mob for any of the brutalities which occurred.
