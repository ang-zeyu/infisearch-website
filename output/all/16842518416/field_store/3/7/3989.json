Be off with yez!\"  After accepting a cookie apiece, the children bounced out the back door and down into the garden in search of Carter.  \"We've come, Carter; we've come!\" cried Marjorie, flinging open a door of the green-house in which Carter was busy potting some plants.  \"You don't say so, Miss Mischief! Well, I'm right down glad to see you! And is this Master King? And Miss Kitty? Well, you all grow like weeds after a rain, but I'll warrant you're as full of mischief as ever!\"  \"Kitty isn't mischievous,\" said Marjorie, who was proud of the sedate member of the family.  \"And it's Miss Kitty who's to spend the summer, isn't it? Well, then, I won't have the times I had last year, pulling children up from down the well,--and picking them up with broken ankles after they slid down the roof! Nothing of that sort, eh?\" Carter's eyes twinkled as he looked at Marjorie, who burst into laughter at reminiscences.  \"No, nothing of that sort, Carter; but we're all going to be here for a few days, and we're going to give you the time of your life. Will you take us out rowing in the boat?\"  \"I'll go along with you to make sure you don't drown yourself; but I think you're getting big enough to do your own rowing. I'm not as young as I was, Miss Midget, and I'm chock-full of rheumatism.\"  \"Oh, we'd just as lieve row, Carter; King's fine at it, and I can row pretty well myself.\"  But Kitty said: \"I'm sorry you have rheumatism, Carter; I'll ask Mother to give you something for it.\"  \"Now that's kind and thoughtful of you, Miss Kitty. Miss Mischief, here, would never think of that!\" But, as Carter spoke, his eyes rested lovingly on Marjorie's merry face.  \"That's so, Carter,\" she said, a little penitently, \"but do you know, I think if you did take us rowing, it would limber up your arms so you wouldn't have rheumatism!\"  \"Maybe that's so, Miss Mischief,--maybe that's so. Anyway, I'll try both plans, and perhaps it'll help some. But I hear Eliza calling you, so you'd all better skip back to the house. It's nearly supper time.\"  With a series of wild whoops, which were supposed to be indicative of the general joy of living, the three Maynards joined hands, with Kitty in the middle, and raced madly back to the house.  They all tried to squeeze through the back door at once, which proceeding resulted in an athletic scrimmage, and a final burst of kicking humanity into Eliza's kitchen.  \"Howly saints! but ye're the noisy bunch!\" was Eliza's greeting, and then she bade them hurry upstairs and tidy themselves for supper.     CHAPTER VII  AN EARLY ESCAPADE   Marjorie and Kitty occupied the room that had been Marjorie's the summer before. Another little white bed had been put up, and as the room was large, the girls were in no way crowded.  Kitty admired the beautiful room, but in her quiet way, by no means making such demonstrations of delight as Marjorie had when she first saw it. Also Kitty felt a sort of possession, as she would return later and occupy the room for the whole summer.  \"Lots of these things on the shelf, Midget, I shall have taken away,\" she said, as the girls were preparing for bed that same night; \"for they're your things, and I don't care about them, and I want to make room for my own.\"  \"All right, Kit, but don't bother about them now. When you come back in June, put them all in a big box and have them put up in the attic until I come again. I only hope you'll have as good a time here as I had last summer. Molly Moss and Stella Martin are nearer my age than yours, but you'll like them, I know.\"  \"Oh, I know Molly, but I don't remember Stella.\"  \"You'll prob'ly like Stella best, though, 'cause she's so quiet and sensible like you. Molly's a scalawag, like me.\"  \"All right,\" said Kitty, sleepily, for she was too tired to discuss the neighbors, and very soon the two girls were sound asleep.  It was very early when Marjorie awoke the next morning. Indeed, the sun had not yet risen, but the coming of this event had cast rosy shadows before. The east was cloudily bright, where the golden beams were trying to break through the lingering shades of night, and the scattering clouds were masses of pink and silver.  When Marjorie opened her eyes, she was so very wide awake that she knew she should not go to sleep again, and indeed had no desire to. The days at Grandma's would be few and short enough anyway, and she meant to improve every shining minute of them, and so concluded to begin before the minutes had really begun to shine.  She hopped out of bed, and, not to wake Kitty, went very softly to the window, and looked out. Across the two wide lawns she could see dimly the outlines of Stella's house, half-hidden by trees, and beyond that she could see the chimneys and gables of Molly's house. She watched the sun poking the tip edge of his circumference above a distant hill, and the bright rays that darted toward her made her eyes dance with sympathetic joy.  \"Kitty,\" she whispered, not wanting to wake her sister, yet wishing she had somebody to share with her the effect of the beautiful sunrise.  \"You needn't speak so softly, I'm wide awake,\" responded Kitty, in her matter-of-fact way; \"what do you want?\"  \"I want you, you goosey! Hop out of bed, and come and see this gorgiferous sunrise!\"  Slowly and carefully, as she did everything, Kitty folded back the bedcovers, drew on a pair of bedroom slippers, and then put on a kimona over her frilled nightgown, adjusting it in place and tying its blue ribbon.  \"Gracious, Kit! What an old fuss you are! The sun will be up and over and setting before you get here!\"  \"I'd just as lieve see a sunset as a sunrise, anyway,\" declared Kitty, as she walked leisurely across the room, just in time to see the great red gold disc tear its lower edge loose from the hill with what seemed almost to be a leap up in the air.  But once at the window, she was as enthusiastic in her enjoyment of the breaking day as Marjorie, though not quite so demonstrative.  \"Put on a kimona, Midget,\" she said at last; \"you'll catch cold flying around in your night dress.\"  \"Kit,\" said her sister, unheeding the admonition, and sitting down on the edge of her bed as she talked, \"I've the most splendiferous plan!\"  \"So've I,\" said Kitty; \"mine is to go back to bed and sleep till breakfast time.\"  \"Pooh! you old Armadillo! Mine's nothing like that.\"  \"Why am I an Armadillo?\" asked Kitty, greatly interested to know.  \"Because you want to sleep so much.\"  \"That isn't an Armadillo, that's an Anaconda.\"  \"Well, you're it anyway; and it ought to be Armadillo, because it rhymes with pillow! But now, you just listen to my plan. Seem's if I just couldn't wait any longer to see Molly and Stella, and I'm going to dress right, straight, bang, quick! and go over there. Come on.\"  \"They won't be awake.\"  \"Of course they won't; that's the fun of it! We'll throw little pebbles up at their windows, and wake them up, and make them come out.\"  \"Well, all right, I will.\" Kitty reached this decision after a few moments' consideration, as Marjorie felt sure she would. Kitty usually agreed to her older sister's plans, but she made up her mind slowly, while Midget always reached her conclusions with a hop, skip, and jump.  So the girls began to dress, and in a very few minutes they were buttoning each other's frocks and tying each other's hair ribbons.  Marjorie had invented a way by which they could tie each other's hair ribbons at the same time, but as it oftenest resulted in pulled hair and badly made bows, it was not much of a time-saver after all.  \"But I do think, Kit,\" she said, \"being in such haste this morning, we might manage to button each other's dresses at the same time. Stand back to back and let's try.\"  The trial was a decided failure, and resulted only in a frolic, after which the buttoning was done separately and successfully.  \"And anyway, we're not in such a hurry,\" commented Kitty, \"and don't ever try that stunt again, Mopsy. My arms are nearly twisted off!\"  \"All right, Kit, I won't. Now are you ready? Come on; don't make any noise; we don't want to wake anybody.\"  They tiptoed downstairs, and as a greater precaution against waking the sleeping grownups, they went through the kitchen, and out at the back door, which they easily unbolted from the inside.  \"We'll have to leave this door unfastened,\" said Marjorie. \"I hope no burglars will get in.\"  \"Of course they won't; burglars never come around after sunrise. Oh, isn't it lovely to smell the fresh morningness!\"  Kitty stood still, and sniffed the clear, crisp air, while the exhilarating effects of the atmosphere caused Marjorie to dance and prance in circles round her quieter sister.  \"When you've sniffed enough, come on, Kit,\" she said, dancing away toward Stella's house.  Kitty came on, and soon they stood on the greensward directly beneath Stella's bedroom window.  The morning was very still, and the Martins' house looked forbidding, with its silent, closed-up air. It was not yet half-past five, and not even the servants were stirring.  Marjorie's courage failed her. \"I guess we won't try Stella first,\" she whispered to Kitty. \"Stella's so scary. Once I just said '_boo_' at her, and she cried like fury. If we fire pebbles at her window, like as not she'll think it's a burglar and have yelling hysterics.\"  \"Burglars don't throw pebbles to wake people up.\"  \"Well, Stella's just as likely to think they do. You never can tell what Stella's going to think, or what she's going to do, either. Anyway, let's go to Molly's first; you can't scare her.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Kitty, and hand in hand the two girls trudged on to the next house.  \"I believe I'll get up every morning at five o'clock,\" said Marjorie; \"it is so fresh and green and wet.\"  \"Yes, it's awful wet,\" said Kitty, looking at her shoes; \"but it's a delicious kind of a wetness. Dew is awful different from rain.\"  \"Yes, isn't it; dew makes you think"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15077"],["title","The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's Note: This book is heavily illustrated; references to the illustrations have been removed from this text version.

JEREMY FISHER  BY BEATRIX POTTER   _Author of_ _\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\" &c._    FREDERICK WARNE & CO., INC. NEW YORK     COPYRIGHT, 1906 BY FREDERICK WARNE & CO    FOR STEPHANIE FROM COUSIN B.      Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.  The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.  But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!   He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--  \"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.\"  Mr. Jeremy put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.  The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.  Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. \"I know a good place for minnows,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.  Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.  The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.  \"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.  \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.  Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.  Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.  \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had better get away from here.\"  Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!  \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.  But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!  The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.  And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a _much_ worse thing happened; a really _frightful_ thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!  A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!  But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.  Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.  He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.  \"What a mercy that was not a pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!\"  He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.  Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat,  And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.  And instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!"]]]
