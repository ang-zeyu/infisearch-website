England has borrowed a billion or so of dollars from us, but the obligation is not all her way. The moral strength of our cause is immeasurably increased by her alliance, and the spectacle of a great democracy organizing itself for complete unity in a world crisis is worth an incalculable amount to us. Such a vision Miss Fraser has brought to her wider public among the women of America in this notable book. Of her personal influence let me quote again from the Vassar students' newspaper:  \"Miss Fraser, here's to you! We don't need to say that we liked Miss Fraser and everything she had to tell us. The way we followed her around, and packed every room in which she spoke, out to the doors and sometimes up to the ceiling, is proof enough of that. And even the fact that it was Sunday could not check our outburst of song in the Soap Palace as Miss Fraser departed. Her gracious speech of appreciation left with us the question not phrased by her before, but certainly in the minds of every one of us who had been hearing her: 'What are _we_ going to do?'\"  An unsolicited testimonial, this, of the most genuine kind. The College students of today are not easily coaxed into lecture rooms outside of their own classes.  I believe that Miss Fraser's book will be read with the same eager attention that followed her first speeches in this country as she began her work of educating American women to a sense of what the mobilization of the entire citizen army of a democracy must mean.  Nor will her influence cease there. Miss Fraser's book is a piece of history; and history is action. The wonderful work of the women of England is already emulated by the splendid efforts along many lines of the women in our country. The new lessons of co-operation and of selfless devotion, learned from this book will, I confidently predict, within a few months, be translated into action by the Women's War Service Committees in every state of our land.  And the greatest lesson of all is that women and men must work together in this new world. I count it an honour--being a man--to be asked to introduce Miss Fraser in this way to the American public. For my part I would have no separate women's division, except such as concerns the tasks exclusively for women. I would have women side by side with men in every division of labour, working out the task with equal fidelity, equal authority, and equal rewards. One of the results of this amazing age is going to be the new comprehension, understanding, and sympathy of the one sex for the other.                                                     H.N. MacCRACKEN.   Vassar College,   Poughkeepsie, New York.   January 11, 1918.         *       *       *       *       *     The women of all the allies are one in this great struggle. Our hopes and our fears, our anxieties and our prayers, our visions and our desolations, are the same.  Our work is the same task of supporting and sustaining the energies of our men in arms and of our nations at home. All the allied women know more of each other than they ever did before, and this is all to the good.  The task of women in this struggle and in the reconstruction to come after, are great tasks, and the world needs in every country not only the wisdom and knowledge of its own women but the strength in them that comes from being one of a great world-wide group and conscious of the unity of all women.  Anything that can help to that unity and understanding seems to me of great value, and this record is written for American women in the hope it may be of some small service.                                                                 H.F.   December 25, 1917.         *       *       *       *       *     THE SPIRIT OF WOMEN       \"I have no fear nor shrinking. I have seen death so often that     it is not strange or fearful to me.... I thank God for this     ten weeks' quiet before the end. Life has always been hurried     and full of difficulty. This time of rest has been a great     mercy. They have all been very kind to me here. But this I     would say, standing as I do in view of God and eternity, I     realise that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred     or bitterness towards anyone.\"                                       --EDITH CAVELL's last message.         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER I  THE SPIRIT OF WOMEN  TO WOMEN    Your hearts are lifted up, your hearts     That have foreknown the utter price,   Your hearts burn upward like a flame     Of splendour and of sacrifice.    For you too, to battle go,     Not with the marching drums and cheers,   But in the watch of solitude     And through the boundless night of fears.    And not a shot comes blind with death,     And not a stab of steel is pressed   Home, but invisibly it tore,     And entered first a woman's breast.                            From LAWRENCE BINYON's \"For the Fallen.\"   The spirit of women in this greatest of world struggles cannot, in its essence, be differentiated from the spirit of men. They are one. The women of our countries in the mass feel about the issues of this struggle just as the men do; know, as they do, why we fight, and like them, are going on to the end. The declarations of our Government as to conditions for peace are ours, too, and when we vote, we shall show the spirit of women is clearly and definitely on the side of freedom, justice and democracy.  Our actions speak louder than any words can ever do, and the record of our women's sacrifices and work stand as great silent witnesses to our spirit. There is nothing we have been asked to do that we have not done and we have initiated great pieces of work ourselves. The hardest time was in the beginning when we waited for our tasks, feeling as if we beat stone walls, reading our casualty lists, receiving our wounded, caring for the refugees, doing everything we could for the sailor and soldier and his dependants, helping the women out of work, but feeling there was so much more to do behind the men--so very much more--for which we had to wait. We did all the other things faithfully and, so far as we could, prepared ourselves and when the tasks came, we volunteered in tens of thousands, every kind of woman, young, old, middle-aged, rich and poor, trained and untrained, and today we have 1,250,000 women in industry directly replacing men, 1,000,000 in munitions, 83,000 additional women in Government Departments, 258,300 whole and part-time women workers on the land. We are recruiting women for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps at the rate of 10,000 a month and we have initiated a Women's Royal Naval Service. We have had the help of about 60,000 V.A.D.'s (Voluntary Aid Detachment of Red Cross) in Hospitals in England and France, and on our other fronts, in addition to our thousands of trained nurses.  The women in our homes carry on--no easy task in these days of shortages in food and coal and all the other difficulties, saving, conserving, working, caring for the children, with so many babies whose fathers have never seen them, though they are one to two years old, and so many babies who will never see their fathers.  Some of our women have died on active service, doctors, nurses and orderlies. Our most recent and greatest loss is in the death of Dr. Elsie Inglis, the initiator of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, who died on November 26th, three days after she had safely brought back her Unit from South Russia, which had been nursing the Serbians attached to the Russian army.  One who was with her at the end writes, \"It was a great triumphant going forth.\" There was no hesitation, no fear. As soon as she knew she was going, that the call had come, with her wonted decision of character, she just readjusted her whole outlook. \"For a long time I _meant_ to live,\" she said, \"but now I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14676"],["title","Women and War Work (#1)"],["body","I am going. It is so nice to think of beginning a new job over there! But I would have liked to have finished one or two jobs here first!\"  She told us the story of the breaking of their moorings as they lay in the river in a great storm of wind and of how that breaking had saved them from colliding with another ship. \"I asked,\" she said, \"what had happened.\" Someone said \"Our moorings broke.\" I said, \"No, a hand cut them!\" Then, after a moment's silence, with an expression in face and voice which it is utterly impossible to convey, she added, \"That same Hand is cutting my moorings now, and I am going forth!\" The picture rose before you of an unfettered ship going out to the wide sea and of the great untrammelled, unhindered soul moving majestically onwards.  [Illustration: MISS EDITH CAVELL]  [Illustration: DR. ELSIE INGLIS]  There was no fear, no death! How could there be. She never thought of her own work--she knew unity. \"You did magnificently,\" was said to her within an hour of her going. With all her wonted assurance and with a touch of pride she answered, \"My Unit did magnificently.\"  Her loss is irreparable to us, but there is no room for sorrow. She leaves us triumph, victory, and peace.  Edith Cavell's name is another that shines upon our roll of honour--the same serene great spirit--no thought of self, but only a great love and desire to serve--and a great fearlessness. Her message, before she went out alone at dawn to her death, which added another stain to the enemy's pages dark with blood, was the message of one who saw the eternal verities, the things worth living and dying for.  Our men's Roll of Honor is a heavy Roll. We have lost in killed and permanently out of the army, a million men and over 75 per cent of our casualties are our own Island losses. Our women in every village and in every city street have lost husbands, fathers, brothers, lovers and friends. From every rank of life our men have died, the agricultural labourer, the city clerk, the railway man, the miner, the engineer, the business man, the poet, the journalist, the author, the artist, the scientist, the heirs of great names, many of the most brilliant of our young men. We comb out our mines and shipyards, and factories, ceaselessly for more men. Our boys at eighteen go into the army. From eighteen to forty-one every man is liable for service. Our Universities have only a handful of men in them and these are the disabled, the unfit, and men from other countries. Oxford and Cambridge Colleges are full of Officers' Training Corps men. The Examination Schools and the Town Hall at Oxford are Hospitals, and Oxford and Cambridge streets are full of the blue-clad wounded, as are so many of our cities. We are a nation at war, and at war for over three years and everywhere and in everything we are changed.  In these years we women have lived always with the shadow of the war over us--it never leaves us, night or day. We do not live completely where we are in these days. A bit of us is always with our men on our many fields of war. We live partly in France and Flanders, in Italy, in the Balkans, in Egypt and Palestine and Mesopotamia, in Africa, with the lonely white crosses in Gallipoli, with our men who guard us sleeping and waking, going down to the sea in ships and under the sea, fighting death in submarines and mines, and with those who in the air are the eyes and the winged cavalry of our forces.  We mourn our dead, not sadly and hopelessly, though life for many of us is emptier forever, and for many so much harder, and we wear very little mourning. We mourn silently, and with a sure faith that our men's supreme sacrifice is not in vain. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friend.\" The little white crosses of our graves symbolize the faith for which they die.  The message of our soldier poets who have been created by this war and have written immortal verse, and many of whom have died, is the message of men who have seen through the veils of time into eternity, who are free of life and death, whom nothing can hurt, \"if it be not the Destined Will.\"  The veils of time grow thin in these days to those of us who take Death into our reckoning all the time. We think of our men gone on ahead as eternally young.    \"Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal     Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres.   There is music in the midst of desolation     And a glory that shines before our tears.           *       *       *       *       *    \"They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old     Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.   At the going down of the Sun and in the morning     We will remember them.\"  We know, too, though we do not often define it, that the forces we women fight in the enemy are the forces that have left women out in world affairs.  Germany is the Fatherland, never, it is significant, the Motherland as our little Islands are, and its mad dream of militarism and _Weltmacht_ is the dream of men who deny any constructive part to women in the great affairs of life. The hopes of all the democracies are bound up in this struggle and its issue, and there is no real place in the world for the true service and genius and work of women, any more than for that of the mass of men, save in democracy. We mean so much in these days by democracy. It seems to be indefinable in its larger meanings. It is not a system of government, but, on the other hand, no country can be called democratic that has not established political freedom, and no country is truly democratic in which such freedom is only in name, and its women are not included or a group rule or the demagogue and the worst kind of politician hold sway.  Democracy is not here till all serve and all are given opportunities so that they have something of value to give to their country and to the world. Democracy is the ever changing, ever developing, ever creative spirit of man expressing itself in his institutions and systems of government and relationships.  Its quarrel with our enemies, who would impose on the mass of men cast-iron systems, and would set up state idols to be worshipped as higher than the Conscience and spirit of man, is so profound and goes so deeply into knowledge and feelings that are too big for words, that the soldier who never tries to express it but goes out and drills and works and disciplines himself that he may present his body as a living shield for the faith that is within him, and the woman who works with him and behind him, healing and giving, silently, are perhaps wisest of all.  It is no time for words only, though right words are mighty powers, but for living faith in deeds and the spirit of the women of all our allied countries is swift to answer the challenge--by their works shall ye know them.  The spirit of our women shows, like that of the French women who tend their farms, keep their shops, work ceaselessly everywhere, most clearly and wonderfully in their work. In our hundreds of hospitals night and day, they care for the wounded and the sick and the dying, bringing consolation, love, skill, heroism, patience and all fine things as their gift. From myriads of homes they pour forth to their daily toil, carrying on the work of the country, educating the children, taking the place of their men on the railways, the factory, the workshop, the banks and offices. In the munition works, in the shipyards, in the engineering shops, in the aeroplane sheds, they work in tens of thousands--risking life and health in some cases, but thinking little of it, compared with what their men are doing, knee-deep in snow and mud and water in the trenches. \"Is the work heavy?\" you ask. \"Not so heavy as the soldiers'.\" \"Are the hours long?\" \"Six days and nights in the trenches are longer.\" \"We are going to win and you are going to help us\"--and the munition girl and the land girl and the workers answer not only with cheers and words but answer with shells and ships and aeroplanes and submarines and food produced and conserved, and in industrial tasks done by men and women together.  The enemy airships and aeroplanes bomb our cities but our girls \"carry on\"--no telephone girl has left her post--there have been no panics in our workshops.  And the spirit of the Waac--the khaki girl--is the spirit of her brother.  On one occasion in France in an air raid, enemy bombs came very near some girl signallers. They behaved splendidly and someone suggested it should be mentioned in the Orders of the Day. \"No,\" said the Commanding Officer, \"we don't mention soldiers in orders for doing their duty,\"--and that tribute to their attitude is deserved and the right one.  And, like our men, we carry on cheerfully, knowing there is only one possible end, victory. We fight for the sanctity of the given word, for honour, for the rights of individuals and nations, for the ideals that have preserved humanity from barbarism, for the right of service, for the salvation of common humanity.  More, we women work with a feeling in our hearts that we, who bear and cherish life, and to whom its destruction is most terrible, have a great work to do and a great part to play in the settlement of the problem of war in the future.  The transmutation of the struggles of mankind from the physical to the spiritual, the solution of national and international problems, the solution of all the riddles of life that demand an answer or man's conquest, cannot be done by man alone. It is our task also and to the great work of building up a new world after we emerge from this crucible of fire in which the souls of the nations are being tested, the spirit of women has much to bring.     ORGANIZATION AND ITS PITFALLS    \"The more they gazed, the more their wonder grew   That one small head could carry all she knew.\"     CHAPTER II  ORGANIZATION AND ITS PITFALLS   There are people who declare that the winning of this war depends on organization alone."]]]
