What should be done for faulty elimination?     4  More Keys and More Calories   [Sidenote: _List of Foods to Follow_]  The following list probably does not contain all of the foods you might like and want to know about, but from those named you can judge of the food value of others. In general, the caloric value, and therefore the fattening value, depends upon the amount of fat and the degree of concentration.  [Sidenote: _Important_]  But remember this point: _Any food eaten beyond what your system requires for its energy, growth, and repair, is fattening, or is an irritant, or both_.  [Sidenote: _A Moderate Sized Chocolate Cream_]  If a food contains much fat, you will know that it is high in food value, for fat has two and one-quarter times the caloric value that proteins and carbohydrates have. Dry foods are high in value, for they are concentrated and contain little water. Compare the quantity of two heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar, a concentrated food, and one and one-half pounds of lettuce, a watery vegetable, each having the same caloric value. A moderate sized chocolate cream is not only concentrated but has considerable fat in the chocolate.  [Sidenote: _Enuf Sed_]  It is not necessary to know accurately the caloric values. In fact, authorities differ in some of their computations. The list is not mathematically correct, but it will give you a good idea of the relative values, and is accurate enough for our purposes. I have purposely given round numbers, where possible, in order to make them more easily remembered.  In reckoning made dishes, such as puddings and sauces, you must compute the different ingredients approximately. About how much sugar it has, how much fat to the dish, and so on. In reckoning any food, if you are reducing, give it the benefit of the doubt on the high count; and if trying to gain, count it low.  It is well, if you are much overweight or underweight, to have some of these foods that are given weighed, so that you can judge approximately what your servings will total.  [Sidenote: _A Mixture_]  A mixture of foods should be used, in order to get the different elements which are necessary for the human machine. It is not wholesome to have many foods at a meal; but the menu should be varied from day to day.  Any regimen which does not allow some carbohydrates and fats for the fuel foods is injurious if persisted in for a length of time.  [Sidenote: _Thoroughly Masticate Everything_]  As to harmful combinations; there are not many, and if your food is thoroughly masticated you need not concern yourself very much about them. However, if you find a food disagrees with you, or that certain combinations disagree, do not try to use them. Underweight individuals sometimes have to train their digestive tracts for some of the foods they need.  Coffee, tea and other mild stimulants are not harmful to the majority; but, like everything else, in excess they will cause ill health. Alcoholic drinks make the fat fatter and the thin thinner, and both more feeble mentally.  [Sidenote: _I Love Her_]  I hope I have stimulated you to an interest in dietetics. There are many books which go into the subject much more deeply. I recommend, especially, \"The Home Dietitian,\" written by my beloved colleague and classmate, Dr. Belle Wood-Comstock.  Others I have read that are especially suitable for the home are \"Feeding the Family,\" by Mary Schwartz Rose, and \"Dietary Computer,\" by Pope. There are doubtless many other good ones. The Department of Agriculture publishes free bulletins on the subject. Farmers' Bulletin No. 142, by Atwater, is very comprehensive.  Other authorities I have consulted are Lusk, Friedenwald and Ruhräh, Gautier, Sherman, Buttner, Locke and Von Noorden.

Now if your serving of meat or fish is fat,        mentally cut in two for same value. If very        lean, you should add a little.      White Bread: slice 3 x 4x 1/2              100 C.        Compute other breads by this.      Butter: 1 scant tablespoonful              100 C.      Sugar: 1 heaping teaspoonful                50 C.      Potatoes: 1 medium, boiled or baked.       100 C.      Watery Vegetables: 1 helping             15-35 C.  If food is fried, or butter, oil, or cream sauces are added, the C. value increases markedly.   _Review_  1. Why is a mixture of foods necessary?  2. Give the caloric value of the following: 1 glass of milk, skim; buttermilk; 10 chocolate creams; 1 bag peanuts; 1 pat butter; 1 piece pie.  3. Name foods low in caloric value. Why are they valuable?  4. How many calories of bread and butter do you daily consume?  5. Reckon your usual caloric intake. How much of it is in excess of your needs?  6. Memorize caloric value of foods you are fond of.   _This Table of Foods, With the C Given Per Oz. Will Help You_  The caloric value of pure fat is 255 C per oz., dry starches and sugars (carbohydrates), and protein (the meat element), is 113. This means fats are 2-1/4 times more fattening than other foods. Most foods contain considerable water, so the following is an approximate table of foods 'as is.' I have given round numbers in the table so you can more easily remember them. _Memorize it_.                              Calories per oz.

First: As to the amount needed.  Second: As to whether animal flesh protein is necessary.  [Sidenote: _Chittenden_]  AMOUNT NEEDED: It was thought for many years that 150 grams or 5 ounces of dry protein (equivalent to about 1-1/2 pounds lean meat) per day was necessary. But experiments of Chittenden and others have proved that considerably less is sufficient, and that the health is improved if less is taken.  Chittenden's standard is 50 grams, or 1-2/3 ounces, dry protein (equivalent to 1/2 pound meat per day). This is considered"]]]
