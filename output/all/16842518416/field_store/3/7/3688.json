SUCH A RUMPUS AS THERE WAS RIGHT AWAY IN THAT       HOLLOW TREE!    \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?\" EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS ALL TOGETHER    HE JUST ATE AND ATE AND ATE UNTIL HE COULDN'T EAT ANOTHER ONE    THERE ALL THE WAY FROM FARMER BROWN'S HEN-HOUSE, WAS A BROAD TRAIL       IN THE SMOOTH WHITE SNOW    \"YO' TELL UNC' BILLY POSSUM THAT AH DON' CARE IF HE NEVER COMES BACK\"      I  UNC' BILLY POSSUM IS CAUGHT   The Green Meadows were thrown into great excitement late one afternoon, just as the black shadows came creeping down from the Purple Hills. Reddy Fox brought the news, and when he told it he grinned as if he enjoyed it and was glad of it.  \"Old Billy Possum is dead. I know it because I saw Farmer Brown's boy carrying him home by the tail,\" said Reddy. \"So you see he wasn't so smart as you thought he was,\" he added maliciously.  No one really believed Reddy Fox, for every one knows that he seldom tells the truth, but when Jimmy Skunk came mournfully down the Crooked Little Path and said that it was true, they had to believe it. Then everybody began to talk about Unc' Billy and say nice things about him and tell how much they had enjoyed having him live in the Green Forest since he came up from \"Ol' Virginny.\" That is, everybody but Reddy Fox said so. Reddy said that it served Unc' Billy right, because he was of no account, anyway. Then everybody began to hoot and hiss at Reddy until he was glad enough to slink away.  And while they were all saying such nice things about him, Unc' Billy Possum was having an exciting adventure. For once he had been too bold. He had gone up to Farmer Brown's hen-house before dark. Jimmy Skunk had tried to stop him, but he had heeded Jimmy Skunk not at all. He had said that he was hungry and wanted an egg, and he couldn't wait till dark to get it. So off he had started, for Unc' Billy Possum is very headstrong and obstinate.  He had reached the hen-house and slipped inside without being seen. The nests were full of eggs, and soon Unc' Billy was enjoying his feast so that he forgot to keep watch. Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped Farmer Brown's boy to get some eggs for supper. There was no time to run. Unc' Billy just dropped right down in his tracks as if he were dead.  When Farmer Brown's boy saw him, he didn't know what to make of him, for he had never seen Unc' Billy before.  \"Well, well, I wonder what happened to this fellow,\" said Farmer Brown's boy, turning Unc' Billy over with the toe of one foot. \"He certainly is dead enough, whatever killed him. I wonder what he was doing in here.\"  Then he saw some egg on Unc' Billy's lips. \"Ho! ho!\" shouted Farmer Brown's boy. \"So you are the thief who has been getting my eggs!\" And picking up Unc' Billy by the tail, he started with him for the house.  As they passed the woodpile, he tossed Unc' Billy on the chopping-block while he gathered an armful of kindlings to take to the house. When he turned to pick up Unc' Billy again, Unc' Billy wasn't there.  Farmer Brown's boy dropped his wood and hunted everywhere, but not a trace of Unc' Billy could he find.     II  REDDY FOX THINKS HE SEES A GHOST   Reddy Fox came down the Lone Little Path through the Green Forest on his way to the Green Meadows. He had brushed his red coat until it shone. His white waistcoat was spotless, and he carried his big tail high in the air, that it might not become soiled. Reddy was feeling as fine as he looked. He would have liked to sing, but every time he tried his voice cracked, and he was afraid that some one would hear him and laugh at him. If there is one thing that Reddy Fox dislikes more than another, it is being laughed at.  Reddy chuckled at his thoughts, and what do you think he was thinking about? Why, about how he had seen Farmer Brown's boy carrying off Unc' Billy Possum by the tail the afternoon before. He knew how Farmer Brown's boy had caught Unc' Billy in the hen-house, and with his own eyes he had seen Unc' Billy carried off. Of course Unc' Billy was dead. There could be no doubt about it. And Reddy was glad of it. Yes, Sir, Reddy was glad of it. Unc' Billy Possum had made altogether too many friends in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows, and he had made Reddy the laughing-stock of them all by the way he had dared Reddy to meet Bowser the Hound, and actually had waited for Bowser while Reddy ran away.  Reddy remembered that Unc' Billy's hollow tree was not far away. He would go over that way, just to have another look at it. So over he went. There stood the old hollow tree, and half way up was the door out of which Unc' Billy used to look down on him and grin. It was Reddy's turn to grin now. Presently he sat down with his back against the foot of the tree, crossed his legs, looked this way and that way to make sure that no one was about, and then in a dreadfully cracked voice he began to sing:     \"Ol' Bill Possum, he's gone before!     Ol' Bill Possum, he is no more!           Bill was a scamp, Sir;           Bill was a thief!           Bill stole an egg, Sir;           Bill came to grief.     Ol' Bill Possum, it served him right;     And he is no more, for he died last night.\"  \"Very good, Sah, very good. Ah cert'nly am obliged to yo'all for yo' serenade,\" said a voice that seemed to come out of the tree at Reddy's back.  Reddy Fox sprang up as if some one had stuck a pin into him. Every hair stood on end, as he looked up at Unc' Billy's doorway. Then his teeth began to chatter with fright. Looking out of Unc' Billy's doorway and grinning down at him was something that looked for all the world like Unc' Billy himself.  \"It must be his ghost!\" said Reddy, and tucking his tail between his legs, he started up the Crooked Little Path as fast as his legs could take him.  Reddy never once looked back. If he had, he might have seen Unc' Billy Possum climb down from the hollow tree and shake hands with Jimmy Skunk, who had just come along.  \"How did Ah do it? Why, Ah just pretended Ah was daid, when Farmer Brown's boy caught me,\" explained Unc' Billy. \"Of course he' wouldn't kill a daid Possum. So when he tossed me down on the chopping-block and turned his back, Ah just naturally came to life again, and here Ah am.\"  Unc' Billy Possum grinned broader than ever, and Jimmy Skunk grinned, too.     III  UNC' BILLY POSSUM SENDS FOR HIS FAMILY   The news that Unc' Billy Possum wasn't dead at all but was back in his hollow tree in the Green Forest soon spread through all the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows. Everybody hastened to pay their respects, that is everybody but Reddy Fox. Unc' Billy and his partner, Jimmy Skunk, told every one who called how Reddy Fox had thought that Unc' Billy was a ghost and had been frightened almost to death, so that he ran away as fast as his legs could take him. Unc' Billy grinned as he told how Reddy had sat under the hollow tree and tried to sing because he was so glad that Unc' Billy was dead, and all the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows laughed until their sides ached when in a funny, cracked voice Unc' Billy sang the song for them.  Thereafter whenever one of them caught sight of Reddy Fox at a safe distance, he would shout:     \"Ol' Bill Possum, he's gone before!     Ol' Bill Possum, he is no more!\"  It got so that Reddy never came down on the Green Meadows in the daytime, and at night he avoided meeting any one if possible, even his old friend, Bobby Coon. And of course Reddy Fox hated Unc' Billy Possum more than ever.  But Unc' Billy didn't care, not he! He knew that all the rest of the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows thought him the smartest of them all, because of the way in which he had fooled Bowser the Hound and Farmer Brown's boy. He liked his neighbors, he liked the Green Forest, and so he made up his mind that this was the place for him to stay.  But in spite of all his friends, Unc' Billy was lonesome. The longer he stayed, the more lonesome he grew, Unc' Billy wanted his family, whom he had left way down in \"Ol' Virginny.\" Finally he told Jimmy Skunk all about it, and for once Unc' Billy had forgotten how to grin. Yes, Sir, Unc' Billy had forgotten how"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14732"],["title","The Adventures of Unc' Billy Possum (#1)"],["body"," grin. Instead he just wept, wept great big tears of lonesomeness.  \"Ah reckon Ah'll have to go back to Ol' Virginny, Ah cert'nly do,\" said Unc' Billy Possum.  Jimmy Skunk grew very thoughtful. Since he and Unc' Billy Possum had been in partnership, Jimmy had had more eggs to eat than ever before in his whole life. Now Unc' Billy was talking about going away. Jimmy thought very hard. Then he had a bright idea.  \"Why not send for your family to come here and live in the Green Forest, Uncle Billy?\" he asked.  Unc' Billy stopped crying. His two little eyes looked up sharply. \"How do yo'all reckon Ah can send word?\" he asked.  Jimmy scratched his head. \"There's Mr. Skimmer the Swallow; he's fixing to go South. Perhaps he'll take the message to your family,\" said he.  \"The very thing!\" cried Unc' Billy Possum, wiping his eyes. \"Ah thanks yo', Sah. Ah does, indeed. Ah'll see Mistah Skimmer at once.\"  And without another word Unc' Billy Possum started down the Crooked Little Path for the Green Meadows to look for Skimmer the Swallow.     IV  BOBBY COON ENTERS THE WRONG HOUSE   After Unc' Billy Possum had arranged with Skimmer the Swallow, who was going South, to take a message to his family in \"Ol' Virginny,\" telling them to come and join him in the Green Forest, he at once began to make preparations to receive them. Unc' Billy isn't any too fond of work. He had a lot rather that some one else should do the work for him, and he is smart enough to fix it so that usually some one else does.  But getting ready to receive his family was different. No one else could arrange things to suit him. This was Unc' Billy's own job, and he tended right to it every minute of the day. First of all he had to clean house. He had been keeping bachelor's hall so long in the big hollow tree that things were not very tidy. So Unc' Billy cleaned house, and while he worked he whistled and sang. Peter Rabbit, passing that way, overheard Unc' Billy singing:     \"Mah ol' woman is away down Souf--             Come along! Come along!     Ain't nothin' sharper than the tongue in her mouf--             Come along! Come along!     She once was pretty, but she ain't no mo',     But she cooks mah meals an' she sweeps mah flo';     She darns mah stockings an' she mends mah coat,     An' she knows jes' how mah chillun fer to tote--             Come along! Come along!     \"Mah pickaninnies am a-headin' dis way--             Come along! Come along!     Daddy am a-watchin' fo' 'em day by day--             Come along! Come along!     Mah ol' haid aches when Ah thinks ob de noise     De's boun' to be wid dem gals an' boys,     But Ah doan care if it busts in two     If de good Lord brings dem chillun troo--             Come along! Come along!\"  Every little while Unc' Billy Possum would sit down to rest, for he wasn't used to so much real work. But finally he got his house clean and made as comfortable as possible, and about that time be began to think how good an egg would taste. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted that egg.  \"It's no use talking, Ah just naturally has to have that egg,\" said Unc' Billy to himself, and off he started for Farmer Brown's.  Now Unc' Billy was hardly out of sight when along came Bobby Coon. Bobby Coon was absent-minded, or else he was so sleepy that he didn't know what he was doing, for Bobby Coon had been out all night. Anyway, when he reached Unc' Billy Possum's hollow tree, he began to climb up it just as if it were his own. He looked in at Unc' Billy's door. There was the most comfortable bed that he had seen for a long time. He looked this way and he looked that way. Nobody was in sight. Then he looked in at Unc' Billy's door once more. That bed certainly did look soft and comfortable. Bobby Coon chuckled to himself.  \"I believe I'll just see if that bed is as comfortable as it looks,\" said he.  And two minutes later Bobby Coon was curled up fast asleep in Unc' Billy Possum's bed.     V  BOBBY COON IS WAKED UP      \"Dey's a-coming, dey's a-coming, dey's a-coming mighty soon.     But dey can't come soon enuff fo' me!     Dey's a-coming, dey's a-coming at de turning ob de moon,     Whar Ah waits in mah ol' holler tree!\"  Unc' Billy Possum was singing to himself, as he slowly trudged home from Farmer Brown's hen-house. He was feeling very good, very good indeed, was Unc' Billy Possum. No one appreciates strictly fresh eggs more than Unc' Billy does, and he had found more than he could eat waiting for him in Farmer Brown's hen-house. Now his stomach was full, his house had been cleaned and put to rights, ready for his family when they should arrive from \"Ol' Virginny,\" and he had nothing to do but wait for them. So he trudged along and sang in a funny, cracked voice.  Presently he came to his big hollow tree and started to climb up to the door of his house. Half way up he broke off short in the middle of his song and sat down on a convenient branch. He put one ear against the trunk of the tree and listened. Then he put the other ear against the tree and listened. There certainly was a funny noise, and it seemed to come from right inside his hollow tree. Unc' Billy turned and looked up at his doorway, scratching his head thoughtfully with one hand.  \"Mah goodness!\" said Unc' Billy, \"it cert'nly sounds like there was somebody in mah house!\"  Then very softly Unc' Billy crept up to his doorway and peeped in. It was dark inside, so that Unc' Billy could see little else than that his nice, freshly made, comfortable bed was all mussed up. But if he couldn't see, he could hear. Oh, yes, indeed, Unc' Billy could hear perfectly well, and what he heard was a snore! There was some one in Unc' Billy's house, and more than that, they were fast asleep in Unc' Billy's bed.  \"Mah goodness! Mah goodness!\" exclaimed Unc' Billy Possum, and his two sharp little eyes began to snap. Then he stuck his head in at the door and shouted:  \"Hi, yo'all! What yo' doing in mah house?\"  The only answer was another snore. Unc' Billy waited a minute. Then he put his head in once more.  \"Yo' better come out of mah house, Mr. Who-ever-yo'-are, before Ah comes in and puts yo' out!\" shouted Unc' Billy.  The only answer was a snore louder than before. Then Unc' Billy quite lost his temper. Some one who had no business there was in his house! He didn't know who it was, and he didn't care. They were going to come out or he would know why not. Unc' Billy gritted his teeth and in he went.  My! my! my! such a rumpus as there was right away in that hollow tree! Peter Rabbit happened to be coming along that way and heard it. Peter stopped and gazed at the hollow tree with eyes and mouth wide open. Such a snarling and growling! Then out of the doorway began to fly leaves and moss. They were part of Unc' Billy's bed. Then Peter saw a big ringed tail hanging out of the doorway. Peter recognized it right away. No one possessed a tail like that but Bobby Coon.  In a minute Bobby followed his tail, hastily backing down the tree. Then Unc' Billy's sharp little old face appeared at the doorway. Unc' Billy looked down at Peter Rabbit and grinned.  \"Ah guess Mistah Coon done make a mistake when he went to bed in mah house,\" said he.  And Bobby Coon sheepishly admitted that he did.     VI  SAMMY JAY LEARNS PETER RABBIT'S SECRET      \"I'm Mr. Jaybird, tee-hee-hee!     I'm Mr. Jaybird; you watch me!     You've got to rise 'fore break of day     If you want to fool old Mr. Jay.\"   Over and over Sammy Jay hummed this, as he brushed his handsome blue and white coat. Then he laughed as he remarked to no one in particular, for no one was near enough to hear: \"Peter Rabbit's got a secret. When Peter goes about whispering, it's a sure sign that he's got a secret. He thinks that he can keep it from me, but he can't. Oh, my, no! I never knew of a secret that could be kept by more than two people, and already I've seen Peter whisper to five. I'll just see what Reddy Fox knows about it.\"  With a flirt of his tail Sammy Jay started for the Green Meadows, where Reddy Fox was busy hunting for his breakfast.  \"It's a fine morning, Reddy Fox,\" said Sammy Jay.  \"It would be finer, if I could fill my stomach faster,\" replied Reddy.  \"That's a pretty good secret of Peter Rabbit's, isn't it?\" asked Sammy, pretending to look very wise.  Reddy pricked up his sharp little ears.  \"What secret?\" he demanded.  \"If you don't know, I'm not going to tell,\" retorted Sammy Jay, just as if he knew all about it, and off he flew to hunt up his cousin, Blacky the Crow. Blacky knew nothing about Peter Rabbit's secret, nor did Shadow the Weasel, whom he met by the way. But Sammy Jay was not in the least bit discouraged.  \"I'll try Johnny Chuck; he'll know,\" said Sammy to himself.  He found Johnny sitting on his doorstep, watching the world go by.  \"Good morning, Johnny Chuck,\" said Sammy, with a low bow.  \"Good morning,\" replied Johnny Chuck, who always is polite.  \"Isn't that a fine secret of Peter Rabbit's?\" exclaimed Sammy, just as if he knew all about it.  Johnny Chuck raised his eyebrows and put on the most surprised look.  \"Do tell me what it is!\" he begged.  \"Oh, if you don't know, I won't tell, for that wouldn't be fair,\" replied Sammy, and tried to look very honest and innocent, and then he flew over to the Green Forest. And as he flew, he said to himself: \"Johnny Chuck can't fool me; he does know Peter Rabbit's secret.\"  Over in the Green Forest he found Drummer the Woodpecker making a great racket on the hollow limb of an old chestnut. Sammy sat down near by and listened. \"My, that's fine! I wish I could do that. You must be practising,\" said Sammy at the end of a long rat-a-tat-tat.  Drummer the Woodpecker felt very much flattered. \"I am,\" said he. \"I'm practising for Peter Rabbit's party.\"  \"I thought so,\" replied Sammy Jay. Of course he hadn't thought anything of the kind.  \"Won't Unc' Billy Possum be surprised?\" remarked Drummer the Woodpecker, as he sat down to rest.  \"He surely will,\""]]]
