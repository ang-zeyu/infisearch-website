And Lady Mary, who was a Maid of Honour at Court, often told this story to the old Queen Charlotte; by this token that the old King always said, “Eh, eh?  What, what?  Ghosts, ghosts?  No such thing, no such thing!”  And never left off saying so, until he went to bed.  Or, a friend of somebody’s whom most of us know, when he was a young man at college, had a particular friend, with whom he made the compact that, if it were possible for the Spirit to return to this earth after its separation from the body, he of the twain who first died, should reappear to the other.  In course of time, this compact was forgotten by our friend; the two young men having progressed in life, and taken diverging paths that were wide asunder.  But, one night, many years afterwards, our friend being in the North of England, and staying for the night in an inn, on the Yorkshire Moors, happened to look out of bed; and there, in the moonlight, leaning on a bureau near the window, steadfastly regarding him, saw his old college friend!  The appearance being solemnly addressed, replied, in a kind of whisper, but very audibly, “Do not come near me.  I am dead.  I am here to redeem my promise.  I come from another world, but may not disclose its secrets!”  Then, the whole form becoming paler, melted, as it were, into the moonlight, and faded away.  Or, there was the daughter of the first occupier of the picturesque Elizabethan house, so famous in our neighbourhood.  You have heard about her?  No!  Why, _She_ went out one summer evening at twilight, when she was a beautiful girl, just seventeen years of age, to gather flowers in the garden; and presently came running, terrified, into the hall to her father, saying, “Oh, dear father, I have met myself!”  He took her in his arms, and told her it was fancy, but she said, “Oh no!  I met myself in the broad walk, and I was pale and gathering withered flowers, and I turned my head, and held them up!”  And, that night, she died; and a picture of her story was begun, though never finished, and they say it is somewhere in the house to this day, with its face to the wall.  Or, the uncle of my brother’s wife was riding home on horseback, one mellow evening at sunset, when, in a green lane close to his own house, he saw a man standing before him, in the very centre of a narrow way. “Why does that man in the cloak stand there!” he thought.  “Does he want me to ride over him?”  But the figure never moved.  He felt a strange sensation at seeing it so still, but slackened his trot and rode forward. When he was so close to it, as almost to touch it with his stirrup, his horse shied, and the figure glided up the bank, in a curious, unearthly manner—backward, and without seeming to use its feet—and was gone.  The uncle of my brother’s wife, exclaiming, “Good Heaven!  It’s my cousin Harry, from Bombay!” put spurs to his horse, which was suddenly in a profuse sweat, and, wondering at such strange behaviour, dashed round to the front of his house.  There, he saw the same figure, just passing in at the long French window of the drawing-room, opening on the ground.  He threw his bridle to a servant, and hastened in after it.  His sister was sitting there, alone.  “Alice, where’s my cousin Harry?”  “Your cousin Harry, John?”  “Yes.  From Bombay.  I met him in the lane just now, and saw him enter here, this instant.”  Not a creature had been seen by any one; and in that hour and minute, as it afterwards appeared, this cousin died in India.  Or, it was a certain sensible old maiden lady, who died at ninety-nine, and retained her faculties to the last, who really did see the Orphan Boy; a story which has often been incorrectly told, but, of which the real truth is this—because it is, in fact, a story belonging to our family—and she was a connexion of our family.  When she was about forty years of age, and still an uncommonly fine woman (her lover died young, which was the reason why she never married, though she had many offers), she went to stay at a place in Kent, which her brother, an Indian-Merchant, had newly bought.  There was a story that this place had once been held in trust by the guardian of a young boy; who was himself the next heir, and who killed the young boy by harsh and cruel treatment. She knew nothing of that.  It has been said that there was a Cage in her bedroom in which the guardian used to put the boy.  There was no such thing.  There was only a closet.  She went to bed, made no alarm whatever in the night, and in the morning said composedly to her maid when she came in, “Who is the pretty forlorn-looking child who has been peeping out of that closet all night?”  The maid replied by giving a loud scream, and instantly decamping.  She was surprised; but she was a woman of remarkable strength of mind, and she dressed herself and went downstairs, and closeted herself with her brother.  “Now, Walter,” she said, “I have been disturbed all night by a pretty, forlorn-looking boy, who has been constantly peeping out of that closet in my room, which I can’t open. This is some trick.”  “I am afraid not, Charlotte,” said he, “for it is the legend of the house.  It is the Orphan Boy.  What did he do?”  “He opened the door softly,” said she, “and peeped out.  Sometimes, he came a step or two into the room.  Then, I called to him, to encourage him, and he shrunk, and shuddered, and crept in again, and shut the door.”  “The closet has no communication, Charlotte,” said her brother, “with any other part of the house, and it’s nailed up.”  This was undeniably true, and it took two carpenters a whole forenoon to get it open, for examination.  Then, she was satisfied that she had seen the Orphan Boy. But, the wild and terrible part of the story is, that he was also seen by three of her brother’s sons, in succession, who all died young.  On the occasion of each child being taken ill, he came home in a heat, twelve hours before, and said, Oh, Mamma, he had been playing under a particular oak-tree, in a certain meadow, with a strange boy—a pretty, forlorn-looking boy, who was very timid, and made signs!  From fatal experience, the parents came to know that this was the Orphan Boy, and that the course of that child whom he chose for his little playmate was surely run.  Legion is the name of the German castles, where we sit up alone to wait for the Spectre—where we are shown into a room, made comparatively cheerful for our reception—where we glance round at the shadows, thrown on the blank walls by the crackling fire—where we feel very lonely when the village innkeeper and his pretty daughter have retired, after laying down a fresh store of wood upon the hearth, and setting forth on the small table such supper-cheer as a cold roast capon, bread, grapes, and a flask of old Rhine wine—where the reverberating doors close on their retreat, one after another, like so many peals of sullen thunder—and where, about the small hours of the night, we come into the knowledge of divers supernatural mysteries.  Legion is the name of the haunted German students, in whose society we draw yet nearer to the fire, while the schoolboy in the corner opens his eyes wide and round, and flies off the footstool he has chosen for his seat, when the door accidentally blows open.  Vast is the crop of such fruit, shining on our Christmas Tree; in blossom, almost at the very top; ripening all down the boughs!  Among the later toys and fancies hanging there—as idle often and less pure—be the images once associated with the sweet old Waits, the softened music in the night, ever unalterable!  Encircled by the social thoughts of Christmas-time, still let the benignant figure of my childhood stand unchanged!  In every cheerful image and suggestion that the season brings, may the bright star that rested above the poor roof, be the star of all the Christian World!  A moment’s pause, O vanishing tree, of which the lower boughs are dark to me as yet, and let me look once more!  I know there are blank spaces on thy branches, where eyes that I have loved have shone and smiled; from which they are departed.  But, far above, I see the raiser of the dead girl, and the Widow’s Son; and God is good! If Age be hiding for me in the unseen portion of thy downward growth, O may I, with a grey head, turn a child’s heart to that figure yet, and a child’s trustfulness and confidence!  Now, the tree is decorated with bright merriment, and song, and dance, and cheerfulness.  And they are welcome.  Innocent and welcome be they ever held, beneath the branches of the Christmas Tree, which cast no gloomy shadow!  But, as it sinks into the ground, I hear a whisper going through the leaves.  “This, in commemoration of the law of love and kindness, mercy and compassion.  This, in remembrance of Me!”     WHAT CHRISTMAS IS AS WE GROW OLDER. [1851]   TIME was, with most of us, when Christmas Day encircling all our limited world like a magic ring, left nothing out for us to miss or seek; bound together all our home enjoyments, affections, and hopes; grouped everything and every one around the Christmas fire; and made the little picture shining in our bright young eyes, complete.  Time came, perhaps, all so soon, when our thoughts over-leaped that narrow boundary; when there was some one (very dear, we thought then, very beautiful, and absolutely perfect) wanting to the fulness of our happiness; when we were wanting too (or we thought so, which did just as well) at the Christmas hearth by which that some one sat; and when we intertwined with every wreath and garland of our life that some one’s name.  That was the time for the bright visionary Christmases which have long arisen from us to show faintly, after summer rain, in the palest edges of the rainbow!  That was the time for the beatified enjoyment of the things that were to be, and never were, and yet the things that were so real in our resolute"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1467"],["title","Some Christmas Stories (#4)"],["body","that it would be hard to say, now, what realities achieved since, have been stronger!  What!  Did that Christmas never really come when we and the priceless pearl who was our young choice were received, after the happiest of totally impossible marriages, by the two united families previously at daggers—drawn on our account?  When brothers and sisters-in-law who had always been rather cool to us before our relationship was effected, perfectly doted on us, and when fathers and mothers overwhelmed us with unlimited incomes?  Was that Christmas dinner never really eaten, after which we arose, and generously and eloquently rendered honour to our late rival, present in the company, then and there exchanging friendship and forgiveness, and founding an attachment, not to be surpassed in Greek or Roman story, which subsisted until death?  Has that same rival long ceased to care for that same priceless pearl, and married for money, and become usurious?  Above all, do we really know, now, that we should probably have been miserable if we had won and worn the pearl, and that we are better without her?  That Christmas when we had recently achieved so much fame; when we had been carried in triumph somewhere, for doing something great and good; when we had won an honoured and ennobled name, and arrived and were received at home in a shower of tears of joy; is it possible that _that_ Christmas has not come yet?  And is our life here, at the best, so constituted that, pausing as we advance at such a noticeable mile-stone in the track as this great birthday, we look back on the things that never were, as naturally and full as gravely as on the things that have been and are gone, or have been and still are?  If it be so, and so it seems to be, must we come to the conclusion that life is little better than a dream, and little worth the loves and strivings that we crowd into it?  No!  Far be such miscalled philosophy from us, dear Reader, on Christmas Day!  Nearer and closer to our hearts be the Christmas spirit, which is the spirit of active usefulness, perseverance, cheerful discharge of duty, kindness and forbearance!  It is in the last virtues especially, that we are, or should be, strengthened by the unaccomplished visions of our youth; for, who shall say that they are not our teachers to deal gently even with the impalpable nothings of the earth!  Therefore, as we grow older, let us be more thankful that the circle of our Christmas associations and of the lessons that they bring, expands! Let us welcome every one of them, and summon them to take their places by the Christmas hearth.  Welcome, old aspirations, glittering creatures of an ardent fancy, to your shelter underneath the holly!  We know you, and have not outlived you yet.  Welcome, old projects and old loves, however fleeting, to your nooks among the steadier lights that burn around us.  Welcome, all that was ever real to our hearts; and for the earnestness that made you real, thanks to Heaven!  Do we build no Christmas castles in the clouds now? Let our thoughts, fluttering like butterflies among these flowers of children, bear witness!  Before this boy, there stretches out a Future, brighter than we ever looked on in our old romantic time, but bright with honour and with truth.  Around this little head on which the sunny curls lie heaped, the graces sport, as prettily, as airily, as when there was no scythe within the reach of Time to shear away the curls of our first-love.  Upon another girl’s face near it—placider but smiling bright—a quiet and contented little face, we see Home fairly written. Shining from the word, as rays shine from a star, we see how, when our graves are old, other hopes than ours are young, other hearts than ours are moved; how other ways are smoothed; how other happiness blooms, ripens, and decays—no, not decays, for other homes and other bands of children, not yet in being nor for ages yet to be, arise, and bloom and ripen to the end of all!  Welcome, everything!  Welcome, alike what has been, and what never was, and what we hope may be, to your shelter underneath the holly, to your places round the Christmas fire, where what is sits open-hearted!  In yonder shadow, do we see obtruding furtively upon the blaze, an enemy’s face?  By Christmas Day we do forgive him!  If the injury he has done us may admit of such companionship, let him come here and take his place. If otherwise, unhappily, let him go hence, assured that we will never injure nor accuse him.  On this day we shut out Nothing!  “Pause,” says a low voice.  “Nothing?  Think!”  “On Christmas Day, we will shut out from our fireside, Nothing.”  “Not the shadow of a vast City where the withered leaves are lying deep?” the voice replies.  “Not the shadow that darkens the whole globe?  Not the shadow of the City of the Dead?”  Not even that.  Of all days in the year, we will turn our faces towards that City upon Christmas Day, and from its silent hosts bring those we loved, among us.  City of the Dead, in the blessed name wherein we are gathered together at this time, and in the Presence that is here among us according to the promise, we will receive, and not dismiss, thy people who are dear to us!  Yes.  We can look upon these children angels that alight, so solemnly, so beautifully among the living children by the fire, and can bear to think how they departed from us.  Entertaining angels unawares, as the Patriarchs did, the playful children are unconscious of their guests; but we can see them—can see a radiant arm around one favourite neck, as if there were a tempting of that child away.  Among the celestial figures there is one, a poor misshapen boy on earth, of a glorious beauty now, of whom his dying mother said it grieved her much to leave him here, alone, for so many years as it was likely would elapse before he came to her—being such a little child.  But he went quickly, and was laid upon her breast, and in her hand she leads him.  There was a gallant boy, who fell, far away, upon a burning sand beneath a burning sun, and said, “Tell them at home, with my last love, how much I could have wished to kiss them once, but that I died contented and had done my duty!”  Or there was another, over whom they read the words, “Therefore we commit his body to the deep,” and so consigned him to the lonely ocean and sailed on.  Or there was another, who lay down to his rest in the dark shadow of great forests, and, on earth, awoke no more. O shall they not, from sand and sea and forest, be brought home at such a time!  There was a dear girl—almost a woman—never to be one—who made a mourning Christmas in a house of joy, and went her trackless way to the silent City.  Do we recollect her, worn out, faintly whispering what could not be heard, and falling into that last sleep for weariness?  O look upon her now!  O look upon her beauty, her serenity, her changeless youth, her happiness!  The daughter of Jairus was recalled to life, to die; but she, more blest, has heard the same voice, saying unto her, “Arise for ever!”  We had a friend who was our friend from early days, with whom we often pictured the changes that were to come upon our lives, and merrily imagined how we would speak, and walk, and think, and talk, when we came to be old.  His destined habitation in the City of the Dead received him in his prime.  Shall he be shut out from our Christmas remembrance? Would his love have so excluded us?  Lost friend, lost child, lost parent, sister, brother, husband, wife, we will not so discard you!  You shall hold your cherished places in our Christmas hearts, and by our Christmas fires; and in the season of immortal hope, and on the birthday of immortal mercy, we will shut out Nothing!  The winter sun goes down over town and village; on the sea it makes a rosy path, as if the Sacred tread were fresh upon the water.  A few more moments, and it sinks, and night comes on, and lights begin to sparkle in the prospect.  On the hill-side beyond the shapelessly-diffused town, and in the quiet keeping of the trees that gird the village-steeple, remembrances are cut in stone, planted in common flowers, growing in grass, entwined with lowly brambles around many a mound of earth.  In town and village, there are doors and windows closed against the weather, there are flaming logs heaped high, there are joyful faces, there is healthy music of voices.  Be all ungentleness and harm excluded from the temples of the Household Gods, but be those remembrances admitted with tender encouragement!  They are of the time and all its comforting and peaceful reassurances; and of the history that re-united even upon earth the living and the dead; and of the broad beneficence and goodness that too many men have tried to tear to narrow shreds.     THE POOR RELATION’S STORY. [1852]   HE was very reluctant to take precedence of so many respected members of the family, by beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in a goodly circle by the Christmas fire; and he modestly suggested that it would be more correct if “John our esteemed host” (whose health he begged to drink) would have the kindness to begin.  For as to himself, he said, he was so little used to lead the way that really—  But as they all cried out here, that he must begin, and agreed with one voice that he might, could, would, and should begin, he left off rubbing his hands, and took his legs out from under his armchair, and did begin.  I have no doubt (said the poor relation) that I shall surprise the assembled members of our family, and particularly John our esteemed host to whom we are so much indebted for the great hospitality with which he has this day entertained us, by the confession I am going to make.  But, if you do me the honour to be surprised at anything that falls from a person so unimportant in the family as I am, I can only say that I shall be scrupulously accurate in all I relate.  I am not what I am supposed to be.  I am"]]]
