Yuh better sit down on that bucket whilst I'm doing it--if I'm thorough it'll take time.\"  \"Humph!\" said the man again and carefully pared the end of a fat, black cigar.  \"You seem to think you know it all.  What's your trade?\"  \"Punching cows--in Northern Montana,\" answered Weary, mildly.  The man took the trouble to look at him again, this time more critically--and more favorably, perhaps.  \"Bronco-buster?\" he demanded, briefly.  \"Some,\" grinned Weary, his thoughts whirling back to the dust and uproar in the Flying U corrals--and to Glory.  The man seemed to read what was in his eyes.  \"You ought to know better than to founder a three-hundred-dollar trotter, then,\" he remarked, with some of the growl smoothed out of his voice.  \"I sure had,\" agreed Weary, sympathetically.  \"That's why I fired that four-or-five-kinds-of idiot just now,\" confided the other, rising to the sympathy in Weary's tone.  \"I need men that know a little something about horses--the foreman can't always be at a man's elbow.  You can start right in--pay's good.  Go tell the foreman I've hired you; that's him back there in the office.\"  Then came the rain.  Week after week of drab clouds and drizzle, and no sun to hearten a man for his work.  Week after week of bobbing umbrellas, muddy crossings, sloppy pavements and dripping eaves--and a cold that chilled the marrow in his bones.  Weary, after a week of poking along in the rain of an evening when his work was done, threw up his hands, figuratively, and bought him an umbrella, hoping devoutly they would never get to hear of it in Dry Lake.  He stood for two minutes in the deep doorway of the store before he found nerve to open the awkward thing, and when he did so he glanced sheepishly around him as if it were a weak thing to do and a disgraceful.  Fog and rain and mud and mist, day after day through long months. Feeding hungry horses their breakfast at five o'clock in the morning; brushing, currying, combing till they shone satin-smooth.  Harnessing, unharnessing; washing mud from rigs that would be splashed and plastered again before night.  Driving to houses that were known by the number over the door, giving the reins over to somebody and walking back in the rain.  Piling mangers with hay, strewing the stalls deep with straw.  Patting this horse as he passed, commanding the next to move over, stopping to whisper caressing words into the ear of a favorite.  Sitting listlessly in the balcony of some theatre in the evening while a mimic world lived its joys and sorrows below and an orchestra played soft accompaniment to his vagrant thoughts.  All this was Weary's life in Portland.  Not exactly hilarious, that life.  Not a homelike one to a man fresh from eating, sleeping, working, reveling with fellows who would cheerfully give him the coat upon their straight backs if he needed it; fight for him, laugh at him, or laugh with him, tease him, bully him, love him like a brother--in short, fresh from Jim Whitmore's Happy Family.  No one hailed him as Weary; his fellow hostlers called him simply Bill. No one knew the life he knew or loved the things he loved.  His stories of wild rides and hard drives must be explained as he went along and fell even then upon barren soil; so he gave up telling them.  Even his speech, colored as it was with the West which lies East of the Cascades, sounded strange in their ears and set him apart.  They referred to him as \"the cowboy\".  Sometimes, when the skies were leaden and the dead atmosphere pressed his very soul to the dank earth, Weary would hoist his umbrella and walk and walk and walk, till the streets grew empty around him and his footsteps sounded hollow on the pavements.  One Sunday when it was not actually raining he hired a horse and rode into the country--and he came back draggled and unhappy from plodding through the mud, and he never repeated the experiment.  Sometimes he would sit all the evening in his damp-walled room and smoke cigarettes and wonder what the boys were doing, down in the bunk-house at home.  He wondered if they kept Glory up--or if he was rustling on the range, his sorrel back humped to the storms and the deviltry gone out of him with the grim battle for mere life.  Perhaps there was a dance somewhere; it was a cinch they would all be there--and Happy Jack would wear the same red necktie and the same painful smile of embarrassment, and there would be a squabble over the piece of bar mirror to shave by.  And the schoolma'am--  But here Weary's thoughts would shy and stop abruptly, and if it were not too late he would put on his hat and go to a show; one of those ten-cent continuous-performance places, where the Swede and the Dutchman flourish and the Boneless Man ties himself in knots.  A man will grow accustomed to anything, give him time enough.  When four months had passed in this fashion, Weary began insensibly to turn more to the present and less often, to the past.  His work was not hard, the pay was good and he learned the ways of the town and got more in touch with his acquaintances.  They came to fill his life, so that he thought less often of Chip and Cal and Happy Jack and Slim.  Others were gradually taking their places.  No one had as yet come to lift Miss Satterly's brown eyes from the deep places of his heart, because he again shied at women; but he was able to draw a veil before them so that they did not haunt him so much.  He began to whistle once more, as he went about his work; but he never whistled \"Good Old Summertime.\"  There were other foolish songs become popular; he rather fancied \"Navajo\" these days.  It was past April Fool's day, and Weary was singing \"Nava, Nava, my Navajo,\" melodiously while he spread the straw bedding with his fork. It was a beastly day, even for that climate, but he was glad of it.  He had only to fill a dozen mangers and his morning's work was done, with the prospect of an idle forenoon; for no one would want to drive, today, unless it was absolutely necessary.    \"I have a love for-r you that will grow-ow;   If you'll have a coon for a beau--\"  trilled Weary, and snapped the wires off a bale of hay and tore it open, in a hurry to finish.  A familiar, pungent odor smote his nostrils and he straightened.  For a minute he stood perfectly still; then his fingers groped tremblingly in the hay, closed upon something, and every nerve in him quivered.  He held it fast in his shaking hands and sat down weakly upon the torn bale.  It was a branch off a sage bush--dry, shapeless, bruised in the press, but it carried its message bravely.  Holding it close to his face, drinking in the smell of it greedily, he closed his eyes involuntarily.  Great, gray plains closed in upon him--dear, familial plains, scarred and broken with sharp-nosed hills and deep, water-worn coulees gleaming barren and yellow in the sun.  The blue, blue sky was bending down to meet the hills, with feathery, white clouds trailing lazily across. His cheeks felt the cool winds which flapped his hat-brim and tingled his blood.  His knees pressed the throb and life, the splendid, working muscles of a galloping horse.  Weary's head went down upon his hands, with the bit of sage pressed hard against his cheek.  Now he was racing over the springy sod which sent a sweet, grassy smell up to meet him.  Wild range cattle lumbered out of his way, ran a few paces and stopped to gaze after him with big, curious eyes.  Before him stood the white-tented camp of the round-up, and the rope corral was filled with circling horses half hidden by the veil of dust thrown upward by their restless, trampling hoofs.  Now he was in the midst of them, a coil of rope in his left hand; his right swung the loop circling over his head.  And the choking dust was in his eyes and throat, and in his nostrils the rank odor of many horses.  Men were shouting to one another above the confusion.  Oaths were hurled after a horse which warily dodged the rope.  Saddles strewed the ground, bits clanked, spurs jingled, care-free laughs brightened the clamor.  The scene shifted.  He was sitting, helpless, in the saddle while Glory carried him wantonly over the hills, shaking his head to make the broken bridle rattle.  Now he was stopping in front of a vine-covered porch, where a girl lay sleeping in a hammock--a girl with soft, dark hair falling down to the floor in a heavy braid.  Again, he was sitting on the school-house steps, holding a smoking gun in his hand, and the schoolma'am was standing, flushed and reproving, before him.  The wind came and fluttered her skirts--  \"What's the matter, Bill?  Yuh sick?\"  Weary raised a white, haggard face.  The plains, the blue sky, the sunshine, the wind, the girl--were gone.  He was sitting upon a torn bale of hay in a livery stable in Portland.  Through the wide, open door he could see the muddy street.  Gray water-needles darted incessantly up from the pavement where the straight lines of rain struck.  On the roof the rain was drumming a monotone.  In his fingers was a crumpled bit of gray sage-brush.  \"Sick, Bill?\" repeated the foreman, sympathetically.  \"Oh, go to hell!\" said Weary, ungratefully.  He felt tired, and weak and old.  He wanted to be left alone.  He wanted--God, how he wanted the dream to come back to him, and to come back to him true!  To close about him and wrap him in its sunny folds; to steep his senses in the light and the life, the sound and the smell of the plains; to hear the wind rushing over the treeless hills; to see the wild range cattle nosing the crisp, prairie grass.  He got unsteadily upon his legs and went slowly to his room; dropped wearily upon the bed, and buried his face in the pillow like a hurt child.  In his fingers he clutched a pungent, gray weed.     PART SIX  Late that night Weary, his belongings stuffed hurriedly into the suit-case he called his \"war-bag,\" started home; so impatient he had a childish desire to ride upon the engine so that he might"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],["title","William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#0)"],["body","Team       [Illustration: Wm.

William Lloyd Garrison was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, December 10, 1805. Forty years before, Daniel Palmer, his great-grandfather, emigrated from Massachusetts and settled with three sons and a daughter on the St. John River, in Nova Scotia. The daughter's name was Mary, and it was she who was to be the future grandmother of our hero. One of the neighbors of Daniel Palmer was Joseph Garrison, who was probably an Englishman. He was certainly a bachelor. The Acadian solitude of five hundred acres and Mary Palmer's charms proved too much for the susceptible heart of Joseph Garrison. He wooed and won her, and on his thirtieth birthday she became his wife. The bride herself was but twenty-three, a woman of resources and of presence of mind, as she needed to be in that primitive settlement. Children and cares came apace to the young wife, and we may be sure confined her more and more closely to her house. But in the midst of a fast-increasing family and of multiplying cares a day's outing did occasionally come to the busy housewife, when she would go down the river to spend it at her father's farm. Once, ten years after her marriage, she had a narrow escape on one of those rare days. She had started in a boat with her youngest child, Abijah, and a lad who worked in her household. It was spring and the St. John was not yet clear of ice. Higher up the river the ice broke that morning and came floating down with the current. The boat in which Mary Garrison and her baby rode was overtaken by the fragments and wrecked. The mother with her child sought refuge on a piece of ice and was driven shoreward. Wrapping Abijah in all the clothes she could spare she threw him ashore. She and the lad followed by the aid of an overhanging willow bough. The baby was unharmed, for she had thrown him into a snow-bank. But the perils of the river gave place to the perils of the woods. In them Mary Garrison wandered with her infant, who was no less a personage than the father of William Lloyd Garrison, until at length she found the hut of a friendly Indian, who took her in and \"entertained her with his best words and deeds, and the next morning conducted her safely to her father's.\"  The Palmers were a hardy, liberty-loving race of farmers, and Joseph Garrison was a man of unusual force and independence of character. The life which these early settlers lived was a life lived partly on the land and partly on the river. They were equally at home with scythe or oar. Amid such terraqueous conditions it was natural enough that the children should develop a passion for the sea. Like ducks many of them took to the water and became sailors. Abijah was a sailor. The amphibious habits of boyhood gave to his manhood a restless, roving character. Like the element which he loved he was in constant motion. He was a man of gifts both of mind and body. There was besides a strain of romance and adventure in his blood. By nature and his seafaring life he probably craved strong excitement. This craving was in part appeased no doubt by travel and drink. He took to the sea and he took to the cup. But he was more than a creature of appetites, he was a man of sentiment. Being a man of sentiment what should he do but fall in love. The woman who inspired his love was no ordinary woman, but a genuine Acadian beauty. She was a splendid specimen of womankind. Tall she was, graceful and admirably proportioned. Never before had Abijah in all his wanderings seen a creature of such charms of person. Her face matched the attractions of her form and her mind matched the beauty of her face. She possessed a nature almost Puritanic in its abhorrence of sin, and in the strength of its moral convictions. She feared to do wrong more than she feared any man. With this supremacy of the moral sense there went along singular firmness of purpose and independence of character. When a mere slip of a girl she was called upon to choose between regard for her religious convictions and regard for her family. It happened in this wise. Fanny Lloyd's parents were Episcopalians, who were inclined to view with contempt fellow-Christians of the Baptist persuasion. To have a child of theirs identify herself with this despised sect was one of those crosses which they could not and would not bear. But Fanny had in a fit of girlish frolic entered one of the meetings of these low-caste Christians. What she heard changed the current of her life. She knew thenceforth that God was no respecter of persons, and that the crucified Nazarene looked not upon the splendor of ceremonies but upon the thoughts of the heart of His disciples. Here in a barn, amid vulgar folk, and uncouth, dim surroundings, He had appeared, He, her Lord and Master. He had touched her with that white unspeakable appeal. The laughter died upon the fair girlish face and prayer issued from the beautiful lips. If vulgar folk, the despised Baptists, were good enough for the Christ, were they not good enough for her? Among them she had felt His consecrating touch and among them she determined to devote herself to Him. Her parents commanded and threatened but Fanny Lloyd was bent on obeying the heavenly voice of duty rather than father and mother. They had threatened that if she allowed herself to be baptised they would turn her out of doors. Fanny was baptised and her parents made good the threat. Their home was no longer her home. She had the courage of her conviction--ability to suffer for a belief.  Such was the woman who subsequently became the wife of Abijah Garrison, and the mother of one of the greatest moral heroes of the century. Abijah followed the sea, and she for several years with an increasing family followed Abijah. First from one place and then another she glided after him in her early married life. He loved her and his little ones but the love of travel and change was strong within him. He was ever restless and changeful. During one of his roving fits he emigrated with his family from Nova Scotia to the United States. It was in the spring of 1805 that he and they landed in Newburyport. The following December his wife presented him with a boy, whom they called William Lloyd Garrison. Three years afterward Abijah deserted his wife and children. Of the causes which led to this act nothing is now known. Soon after his arrival in Newburyport he had found employment. He made several voyages as sailing-master in 1805-8 from that port. He was apparently during these years successful after the manner of his craft. But he was not a man to remain long in one place. What was the immediate occasion of his strange behavior "]]]
