In answer it should be said that specialists in history ought surely to have read widely enough and studied deeply enough to be _able_ to select intelligent questions of the sort suggested. We have assumed that the teacher has made adequate preparation for his work. Certainly, then, he should be ready to explain the social, geographical, and economic relation of the events mentioned in the lesson. He should know their bearing on current history. He should always have ready a fund of information, additional to that given in the text. In preparing advance questions for distribution to the class the teacher is preparing his own lesson. He may be doing it a day or two earlier than he would otherwise do, but surely he is performing no labor additional to what may reasonably be expected of him. As to the time required to prepare copies of the questions for distribution when the class convenes, it may be said that a neostyle or mimeograph, with which all large schools and many small ones are equipped, makes short work of preparing as many copies of the questions as desired. If there is a commercial department in connection with the school, an available stenographer, or a willing student helper, the teacher may easily relieve himself of the work of supplying the copies. If none of these expedients are possible, it is no Herculean task to write each day on the board the few questions for the next lesson. It will entail no great loss of time if the class are asked to copy them when they first come to recitation. If it is possible to copy them after the recitation, so much the better. And beyond the obvious advantages of a carefully assigned lesson it must be remembered that in the assignment of special topics, in private conferences with the student, in the correction of notes, in giving assistance in the library, the teacher has an opportunity to cultivate a sympathetic relation between himself and the class of inestimable service in securing the best results.     IV  THE METHOD OF THE RECITATION   _Assumptions as to the recitation room_  Let us now assume that the recitation will be held in a quiet room free from the distracting influence of poor light, poor ventilation, and inadequate seating capacity. The blackboard space is ample for the whole class, the erasers and chalk are at hand, the maps, charts, and globe are where they can be used without stumbling over them. The teacher can give his whole attention to the class. Discipline should take care of itself. The pupil who is interested will not be seriously out of order.   _What the teacher should aim to accomplish_  The problem, then, is so to expend the forty-five minutes in which the teacher and class are together that:--       1. So far as possible the atmosphere and setting of the period         being studied may be reproduced.       2. The great historical characters spoken of in the lesson may         become for the student real men and women with whom he will         afterwards feel a personal acquaintance.       3. The events described will be understood and properly interpreted         in their relation to geography, and the economic and social         progress of the world.       4. Causes and effects shall be properly analyzed.       5. And that there shall be left sufficient time for the occasional         review necessary to any good instruction.   _Work at the blackboard_  The first five minutes may profitably be spent at the board, each member of the class being asked to write a complete answer to one of the assigned questions. Whatever may happen later in the recitation each student has had at least this much of an opportunity for self-expression, and his work should be neat, workmanlike, complete, and accurate. By this device the alert teacher will secure in the first five minutes of the recitation hour a fairly accurate idea of each student's preparation, the weak spots in his understanding of the lesson, and the errors to be corrected. He may even be able to record a grade for the work done.   _Special reports_  The class having taken their seats, the next order of business should be the reports on special topics assigned for the purpose of making the period of history under discussion more interesting and vital. As has been said, these reports should not be read, but delivered by the pupil facing the class. The class should be encouraged to ask questions on the report when finished and the student responsible for the report should be expected to answer any reasonable inquiry. If other students are able to contribute to the topics reported on, they should be encouraged to do so. Let the teacher be sure that he has sounded the depths of the students' information and curiosity before he himself discusses the report. If the device of reports delivered in class is to justify itself, the matter contained in them must be so arranged and discussed that the whole class receives real benefit. The ingenious teacher will be able to establish a tradition in his course for a careful preparation and critical discussion of these reports. The rivalry of students for excellence in this work is not difficult to stimulate. A premium should be put on criticism which finds mentioned in the characterization qualities inconsistent with the facts recorded in the text, or omissions which the facts of the text seem to justify.   _Fundamental principles of good questioning_  It is not likely that the teacher will find it advisable to require reports at every recitation nor that the reports and their discussion will consume, at the most, longer than ten or fifteen minutes of any class period. There must always be time for direct oral questioning on the facts of the lesson; questioning that will test the student's memory, ability to analyze, and powers of expression. Certain principles are fundamental to good questioning in any recitation.       1. The questions should be brief.       2. They should be prepared by the teacher before coming to         recitation. This will insure rapidity. A vast deal of time is         lost by the unfortunate habit possessed by many teachers of         never having the next question ready to use.       3. They should precede the name of the pupil required to answer it.       4. They should not be leading questions to which the pupil can         guess the answers.       5. They should be grammatically stated with but one possible         interpretation.       6. Except for purposes of rapid review they should not be         answerable with yes or no.       7. They should be asked in a voice loud enough to be heard by all         the class, and only once.       8. They should be asked in no regular order, but nevertheless in         such a way that every member of the class will have a chance to         recite.    _Some additional suggestions for teachers of history_  There are additional suggestions particularly applicable to the teacher of history.       1. In all the questioning remember the purposes of the recitation.         Ask questions knowing exactly what you wish as an answer. There         is no time for aimless or idle questioning.       2. Inquire frequently as to the books used in preparation of the         lesson. Let no allusion or statement in the text go unexplained.         Let none of the author's conclusions or opinions go         unchallenged. Ask the student for inconsistencies, inaccuracies,         or contradictions in the text. Put a premium on their discovery.         Insist on the student's authority for statements other than         those given in the text.       3. Do not use the heavy-typed words frequently found at the head of         the paragraph or the topical heads furnished by the text, if it         can be avoided. The pupil should not be allowed to remember his         history by its location in the text.       4. Be sure that the class have an opportunity to recite on the         questions assigned for their advance preparation. Nothing is         more discouraging to a student than carefully to prepare the         work required and then fail of an opportunity either to recite         upon or to discuss it.       5. Discover the tastes, shortcomings, and abilities of your         individual students and direct your future questions         accordingly. There will usually be in the class the boy who is         glib without being accurate. He should be questioned on definite         facts. There will be the student whose analysis of events is         good, but whose powers of description are poor. Adapt your         questions to his special need. There will be the pupil with the         tendency to memorize the text _verbatim_. There will be the         student who knows the facts of the lesson, but who fails to         remember the sequence of events--the kind who never can tell         whether the Exclusion Bill came before or after the Restoration.         There will be the usual amount of specialized tastes, curiosity,         timidity, laziness, and rattle-brained thinking. The questioning         should probe these peculiarities, and stimulate the pupil's         ambition to improve his preparation at its weakest point.         Needless to say the questions should not be asked with the daily         idea of making the pupil fail. Like any other surgical         instrument the question probe should be used skillfully and with         a proper motive. It would be as great an error to bend your         questions continually away from the student's special tastes and         abilities as to be perpetually guided by them.       6. The bulk of the teacher's attention should be given neither to         the few exceptionally able students nor to the few very poor         pupils. It is to the average normal boy and girl that the most        "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],["title","The Teaching of History (#5)"],["body"," of the questioning should be directed. The brilliant student         should be called on sufficiently to retain his interest and to         set a standard of excellence for the class. He should be given         the most difficult of the assignments of outside work and if         necessary an additional number of them. As to the few pupils         whom the teacher deems exceptionally poor, it may be said that         the effect of questioning should never be to discourage the         pupil who has made an honest effort at preparation. During the         early part of the course the efforts of the teacher may well be         directed to asking the backward student questions to which he         can make reasonably satisfactory answers. By saving the student         from the daily humiliation of failure before the class, and by         tactfully encouraging him to greater effort, the teacher may         shortly discover that the poor pupil is far from hopeless.       7. Do not allow your questions to consume a disproportionate amount         of time with details. Until very recently in all our history         teaching, battles have been exalted to a place immeasurably         greater than their importance. We are coming to see that the         fighting is one of the least important things in the war. The         causes and results, the financial, political, and social effects         now absorb our attention. One or two battles in a course may         profitably be studied in detail, particularly in the history of         our own country, but in the press of considerations far more         interesting and vital, it is a waste of time to give more than a         moment's notice to the remainder. Student descriptions of         battles are bound to be stereotyped. The ordinary textbook         describes each of the thousand battles of the world in about the         same fifty words.       8. Let some of the questions be directed towards cultivating the         student's powers of oral description. History is not altogether         a matter of analysis or generalization. There can scarcely be         assigned a lesson in history that does not contain events which         lend themselves to dramatic description. Their recital should be         made the occasion of the student's best efforts in this         direction. Let the pupils be taught to use adjectives and         adverbs. Break down the barrier of listlessness or fear or         self-consciousness which keeps the student from rendering a         graphic and thrilling account of great events.       9. Let the questions from day to day develop the continuity of         history. Avoid questioning that fails to unite the events of         previous lessons with the one being studied. Bring out the         connection of the past and the present. Slavery existed in         America for two hundred years before the Civil War was fought.         Your teaching of those two centuries of history should be so         conducted that when the Civil War is finally reached, the class         can tell the process by which anti-slavery sentiment was finally         crystallized. The hiatus between the mobbing of Garrison in         Boston and the extraordinary contribution of Massachusetts to         the Northern army should be bridged, not by a heroic question or         two when the war is finally reached, but by a daily attention to         the events which effected the metamorphosis.      10. If the answer to your question requires the use of a map, ask         it in such a way that the student can talk and use the map at         the same time. The geographical provisions of a treaty, the         routes of explorers, the grants of commercial companies,         campaigns, or military frontiers should all be recited in this         way. A wall map with simply the outline of the territory, with         its rivers, will be of considerable assistance in testing the         accuracy of the student's geographical knowledge. While         reciting, let him locate with chalk or pointer the cities,         arbitrary boundary lines, and routes he finds it necessary to         mention in his recitation. It will require special attention         early in the course to teach students the necessity for         preparation of this sort. Like everything else, map work should         be reasonable in its requirements. A knowledge of geography is         imperative to the correct understanding of history, and the         indifference or ignorance of teachers should never excuse         inattention to this vital necessity. On the other hand, however,         it is equally reprehensible to require of high school students         the labored preparation of maps in the drawing of which hours of         valuable time are spent in searching for places of trivial         importance and small historical value. Map work in a high school         history course should require no more than geographical accuracy         in locating boundaries, routes, and places really vital to the         history of the people being studied. If it does more than this         it usurps time disproportionate to its value.     V  VARIOUS MODES OF REVIEW   _The place of drill in the history recitation_  We have long since learned the folly of spending very many of the minutes of a recitation in drilling students in dates, outlines, and charts. Work of this sort never made a recitation vital; never inspired a student with enthusiasm for historical inquiry; never really dispelled the fog which surrounds, for the student, the cabinets and constitutions, battles and boundaries, declarations and decrees, so briefly treated in the text.   _Good reviews will develop a knowledge of the sequence of events_  But it may be seriously questioned whether many teachers, in their zeal to escape the over-emphasis of dates, have not gone to the extreme of neglecting them altogether. That a student should remember sufficient dates to fix in his mind the sequence of important events is hardly open to question. That he can never do so without some special attention to dates is equally indisputable. Without doubt, drill in important dates is necessary, but it should be so conducted as to take but little time. Each day the teacher has indicated the dates worthy to be remembered and has been careful to select the landmarks of history. He has called attention to the various collateral circumstances which might assist to fix the dates in the child's mind. The student has kept his list of dates in the back of his text or in some convenient place of reference. Once a week for three minutes the teacher gives the class a rapid review on the dates contained in the list. Occasionally the class are sent to the board and asked to write the dates of the reigns of the English monarchs from William down to the point which the class has reached, or the Presidents in their order, or some other similar exercise calculated to give a backbone to the history being studied. The class will know that such a review is liable to be given at any time. They will endeavor to be prepared. The result will be that with the expenditure of a few minutes at intervals in rapid review, history will cease to be a spineless narrative and become for the student an orderly procession of events. Drill in dates is only one method to this end. There may be a rapid review in battles, generals, wars, treaties, proclamations, and inventions. Such exercises encourage the classification of facts and stimulate fluency of expression. It is of the highest importance for the student so to arrange in his mind what he has learned in recitation that he can call to his command at a second's notice the fact, date, or illustration he desires. There will be many times in his school and college career when such an ability will be indispensable; in business or the professions it is an invaluable asset, infinitely more useful than the history itself. It will be well for the teacher to inquire: \"What am I doing to cultivate such an ability in my students?\"   _They will give a view of the whole subject_  Few teachers will deny that too little time is spent in giving the student a general view of the whole subject, either in its entirety or in its various phases. The text has been studied by chapters or by months or by movements. The history as a whole has never been seen. By the time the student has reached the \"Aldrich Currency Plan\" in American history he has forgotten all about the experiments with the first United States Bank. He could no more outline the financial history of the United States as given in his text than he could outline the industrial or political history of the American people. And yet he has studied the facts given in his textbook; he has supplemented the text by his work in the library, and in the recitation; he has done everything that may reasonably be expected of him, except to assemble his historical information and review it as a whole.  If the student in American history is asked to go to the board at intervals and write an outline for the work covered on such topics as the following, he will come much nearer understanding the progress of our people:--       1. History of the tariff.       2. Political parties and principles for which they stood.       3. Things that crystallized Northern sentiment against slavery.       4. Reasons for the unification of the South.       5. Diplomatic relations of the United States.       6. Additions of territory.       7. Financial legislation.       8. Growth of humanitarian spirit.  There will easily be sufficient topics so that each member of the class will have a different one. They can all work at the board, simultaneously. The amount of time used for exercises of this sort need not be great, and the value received is incalculable.
