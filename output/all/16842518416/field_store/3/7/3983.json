A variation from 1-2/3 to 3 ounces dry protein per day will give a safe range. (ROSE.)  [Sidenote: _Approx. 240 to 360 C Per Day_]  _The amount of protein needed is comparatively independent of the amount of physical exertion_, thus differing from the purely fuel foods, carbohydrates and fats, which should vary in direct proportion to the amount of physical exertion. In general, 10 to 15 per cent of the total calories per day should be taken as protein. An excess is undoubtedly irritant to the kidneys, blood vessels, and other organs, and if too little is taken the body tissues will suffer.  Not all of the protein should be taken in the form of animal protein; at least one-half should be taken from the vegetable kingdom.   _Animal Flesh Protein_  [Sidenote: _Necessary?_]  The following are a few of the chief reasons given by those who object to its use:  [Sidenote: _The Negative Side_]  First: The animal has just as much right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness as we have.  Second: They may be diseased, and there is the possibility of their containing animal parasites, such as tapeworms and trichin√¶. I would like to tell you more about worms, they are so interesting, but He says not to try to tell all I know in this little book; that maybe he will let me write another sometime, although it is a terrible strain on him, and that I have given enough of the family history, anyway.  [Sidenote: _Some Word_]  Third: The tissues of animals contain excrementitious material, which may cause excess acidity, raise the blood pressure, and so forth.  Fourth: More apt to putrefy and thus give ptomaine poisoning.  Fifth: Makes the disposition more vicious.  (Honest,--animals eating meat exclusively are more vicious.)  [Sidenote: _The Affirmative Side_]  Those who believe that animal protein should be eaten answer these points as follows:  First: Survival of the fittest.  Second: If you give decent support to your health departments they can furnish enough inspectors to prevent the marketing of diseased meat; and if some should slip through, if you thoroughly bake, boil, or fry your animal parasites they will lose their pep.  Third: Most of the harmful products are destroyed by the intestines and liver.  Fourth: True, but see that you get good meat, and don't eat it in excess.  Fifth: Unanswerable--to be proved later by personal experiments.  In addition, they say that animal protein is more easily digested, that 97 per cent is assimilated because it is animal, and so it is much more to be desired, especially by children and convalescents; that vegetable protein is enclosed in cellulose, and only 65 to 75 per cent is used by the system; thus the diet is apt to be too bulky if the proper amount is taken.  [Sidenote: _Strong Vegetarians_]  It has been proved, however, by several endurance tests, that the vegetarian contestants had more strength and greater endurance than their meat-eating competitors, so there is no reason why we should be worried by one or two, or even more, meatless days, especially when animal product protein, such as milk, eggs, cheese, and the vegetable proteins, as in the legumes and the nuts, are available.  [Sidenote: _A Confession_]  I confess that for quite a while after studying vegetarian books I took a dislike to meat, but now I am in the comfortable state described by Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography. It seems that he had been converted to vegetarianism and had decided that he never again would eat the flesh of animals that had been ruthlessly slaughtered, when they so little deserved that fate.  But he was exceedingly fond of fish, and while on a fishing party, as some fish were being fried, he found they did smell most admirably well, and he was greatly torn between his desire and his principle. Finally he remembered that when the fish were opened he saw some smaller fish in their stomachs, and he decided that if they could eat each other he could eat them.

In the first chapter, you remember, I said I was not particularly interested in you, but I have changed my mind, and I will treat you tenderly and carefully. I will have to preach a little bit first, but I don't mind that; I love to reform people--Yes, you need reforming!  The first thing many of you have to do is to learn to accept the trivial annoyances and small misfits of life as a matter of course, for to give them attention _beyond their deserts_ is to wear the web of your life to the warp.  Elbert Hubbard never said anything better than that. Have that reproduced in motto form and put it on your bureau, and repeat it fifty times daily.  [Sidenote: _Good Philosophy_]  Adopt my philosophy. If I have a trivial annoyance I analyze it carefully. Was I to blame? Yes? All right, I am glad, because then I can see that it will not happen again, so I stop worrying. If I am not to blame, if I could not help it in the least, well, then I don't worry about it, for that will not help it any, and I wasn't to blame! If it bobs up in my mind again, I say: \"Now, look here, you annoyance, I have given you all the attention you deserve; avaunt, depart, get out!\"  [Sidenote: _Simple_]  Now, how is this philosophy going to help you gain?  [Sidenote: _Lost Calories_]  When you worry needlessly, notice how tense your muscles are. You are exercising them all of the time and using hundreds of calories of energy. You raise your blood pressure, the internal secretory glands may overact (re-read what I have said about these glands in the fat people), and thus many more calories are used. The intestinal secretions do not flow so freely, you have indigestion and do not assimilate your food, and thus hundreds more calories are lost.  It certainly is impossible to gain unless your food is assimilated.  [Sidenote: _Develop Poise_]  So the first thing you have to learn is this mental control and to relax. Remember that word, relax. After you are better nourished your nervous system will not be on hair-trigger tension, and it will be easier for you.  [Sidenote: _No Pain In Matter; No Matter In Pain Why Worry?_]  If you are ill in mind or body, remember that it is natural to be well, and that within your body nature has stored the most wonderful forces which are always tending towards the normal, or health, if not obstructed or hindered.  Nature sometimes needs help to stimulate those forces, or to reinforce them, or to remove obstructions. This is where the physician comes in. But you yourself can aid nature the most by realizing that _nature is health and it is normal to be well_. By so doing, all of your organs function better and you are restored to normal more rapidly.  [Sidenote: _Sleep_]  [Sidenote: _Fresh Air_]  Second: It is very important to have enough sleep. Dr. Richard Cabot says that probably resistance is lowered as much by lack of sufficient sleep as by any other factor, and that all you can soak into your system in twenty-four hours is not too much. Don't forget the fresh air.  You generally suffer from sleeplessness, I believe. The overweights are always advised not to sleep too much. They will find while reducing that they won't want to sleep so much, anyway. They will like to stay awake--they feel so much happier.  [Sidenote: _Sometimes_]  Now, when you retire and try to sleep but cannot, try this--it works with me. You know when you are passing over your mental images become distorted and grotesque. I artificially induce that state. If I find myself rehearsing about two hundred times, with appropriate gestures, the keen, witty, logical remarks which I could have made in favor of my pet legislation in the club discussion, but didn't, then I begin after this fashion:  Pink elephants with green ribbons on their tails--red rhinoceri (is that right, or should it be rhinoceroses?)--smiling peanuts--Woman's City Club--Social Health Insurance--why didn't I say--I wish I had said--(here get out, you annoyance!)--pink elephants--and so forth and so forth.  [Sidenote: _Picture of Pink Elephant Adorned_]  [Sidenote: _Woe Is Me_]  Now I realize I have ruined myself. I am my own worst enemy. I have exposed my whole life before those modern vivisectionists, the army of amateur psycho-analysts.  [Sidenote: _Exercise_]  Third: Exercise. Great muscular exertion should be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15069"],["title","Diet and Health; With Key to the Calories (#6)"],["body","d, but the setting-up exercises that I advise, if begun with moderation and increased gradually, will undoubtedly stimulate the appetite and help the body functions to be better performed.  [Sidenote: _Food_]  Fourth: Since food is the only source of body substance, you must gradually train your stomach so that it can care for enough food to not only supply your bodily energy, but to leave a little excess to be stored as fat.  [Sidenote: _Your Stomach_]  If you have a small appetite--and many of you have--your stomach is undoubtedly contracted, and you must gradually add to the amount you have been eating, even though it may cause some distress, until you have disciplined it so that it can handle what you need without distress. The stomach is a muscular organ and can be trained and exercised somewhat as other organs can. You will not have much appetite at first, but it will develop. Sometimes a short fast for a day or two, drinking nothing but pure water, seems to be beneficial in the beginning.  Do not drink much with your meals, unless the drink has food value by the addition of lots of cream or sugar, or both.  [Sidenote: _Eat More_]  Decide how many calories you need for your activities, gradually add to your dietary until you have reached that number, and then some more, and you will gain as surely as the overweight individual will lose by doing the opposite. It may take a long time, or you may get results very rapidly, depending somewhat upon the individual characteristics. Gradually increase your butter, cream, sugar, chocolate, and so forth, as they are very high in food value.  Study the Key to the Calories and reckon your calories every day for a while. You have already noticed that the foods that you like are low in food value.  Here are some of the things you can take to add to your fuel:  [Sidenote: _Try Some of These_]  A glass of milk, hot or cold, taken between meals and before retiring, will add about 500 calories.  Cream sauce on your vegetables will add to their value.  Cod liver oil, or olive oil, or cream, begun in small doses and gradually increased.  One malted milk, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream, and the malted milk, will add about 500 calories.  [Sidenote: _Learned Phraseology_]  You remember the painful time that I spoke of when there was so much more of me than there ought to be? Well, the aforesaid concoction, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream, and the malted milk, was accessory before the fact, and also particeps criminis before the law.  I absorbed this phraseology by being president of the Professional Woman's Club, with its high-class women attorneys, ministers, dentists, Ph.D.'s, and \"Medical Trust\" doctors.  [Sidenote: _Explanatory Note 1_]  \"Medical Trust.\"--The American Medical Association (A.M.A.), a powerful trust you can't get into unless you have a high preliminary education and are a graduate of a high-class medical college. Eleven years' training after the grammar school is their minimum standard now.  [Sidenote: _Explanatory Note 2_]  \"League for Medical Ignorance.\"--The so-called \"League for Medical Freedom\"; the opponent of the above mentioned trust. Their standard--any old kind of a medical or religious training, two weeks or longer, engrafted on anyone who has the money to pay for the course. No education, no barrier; in fact, those of limited education make the loudest boosters for the league. In justice, I must say that many splendid, estimable persons belong to this league, not knowing these facts.  [Sidenote: _Thorough Mastication_]  Fifth: See page 92 in my advice to the fat. It is as important for you as for them. (It always makes me mildly furious when I look up a word and am directed to seek some other locality. If it affects you that way--seek page 60 in my advice to you.)  Also have your teeth X-rayed. Blind abscesses at the roots will cause all sorts of aches and pains, as well as underweight.  [Sidenote: _Especially About Your Ailments_]  [Sidenote: _Organ Recitals Wednesday Evenings Only_]  Sixth: _Don't talk so much_. See if you can't leave out two-thirds of the totally unimportant, uninteresting details. A tremendous amount of energy is used in talking. This habit I would not say was confined to you, by any means; it is another one of those pretty nearly universal errors.  I will not give you a sample fattening menu, for it might be all out of proportion to what you could handle, and it would upset you. Make out your own menus, realizing that you must work gradually to the desired amount.  I am taking it for granted that you are organically sound, that your scientific, educated physician has said there is nothing the matter with you, except perhaps your \"nervous\" disposition.  Have I not been nice to you? All right, relax and watch yourself get into the class of the plumptically adequate.  And if you don't succeed after a faithful trial, take the milk-cure, with its three to six weeks' absolute rest.  _Recapitulation_       1. Calm yourself.      2. Sleep.      3. Exercise.      4. Food.      5. Masticate      6. Delete the details.      7. Milk-cure.  _Review_       1. Repeat Elbert Hubbard's advice.      2. Give three reasons why worry can make      you thin.      3. Define \"Medical Trust\" and \"League      for Medical Freedom.\"      4. Memorize paragraph about nature      5. Enumerate the things you can eat to      increase your calories.     7  Exercise   It is practically impossible to reduce weight through exercise alone, unless one can do a tremendous amount of it. For the food that one eats is usually enough to cover the energy lost by the exercise.  [Sidenote: _Light On Your Feet_]  However, exercise is a very important feature of any reducing program; not because of the fat that is burned up in the exercise--and there is some burned--but for the reason that it is necessary to keep one in a healthy condition. The muscles, the internal organs, the bones, the brain, are all benefited--in fact, the entire system.  [Sidenote: _Duty Dances_]  The exercises described hereinafter will help make you fat or thin, and they will keep you supple, graceful, and light on your feet, so that when I tell my husband that he must dance with you, Madam, he will not say, \"Nothing stirring,\" and when you, Professor, ask me to dance, I will not curse the day I was born.  [Sidenote: _Warning_]  If you have not been accustomed to exercise, I warn you to take up only one or two at a time and do each one a few times only. You will be atrociously sore, and you will realize that you have muscles of which you wotted not.  However, persist, if you are sure there are no organic reasons why you shouldn't--such as a weak heart. (In case you are very much overweight, I think it advisable to wait until you have reduced somewhat.)  [Sidenote: _Or Classic Dancing_]  It is splendid if you can belong to a gymnasium or to a physical culture class, but ten to fifteen minutes' systematic daily exercise practiced with vim, and each set followed by deep breathing, will do more good than a gymnasium spasmodically attended. Brisk walking with a long stride isn't so bad; in fact, if taken with a very long stride it will twist 'most every organ you have in your body.  There are hundreds of exercises you can take. If you will notice little rascal's illustrations you will find many good ones. Those illustrating the beginning of this chapter are excellent.  If possible, it is best to take the exercises on arising in the morning, but if you have a household to care for you may not be able to do so. For those who have to do their own work, it may be well to do the work first. You can do it in half the time if you plan it carefully and speed up. (This advice is not for my thin friends; their speedometers register too high already.) It does not matter so much when the exercises are done as that they are done, and done every day for the rest of your life, with the possible exception of two or three days a month.  Gallstones, permanent stiff joints, and other little things like that will have a hard time forming.  _My Exercises_  [Sidenote: _They Reach Most of My Muscles_]  (The services of my noted artist I was able to obtain with great difficulty, as he was engaged in the more important work of making a swagger stick. I finally secured him by the promise of an ice cream cone and twenty-three cents to go with his two cents so that he could buy a Thrift Stamp. He is given due credit on the title page.)  [Sidenote: _Turn On Your Music_]  These exercises executed with vim, vigor, and vip--deep breathing between each set--will take ten to fifteen minutes. Re-read my warning.  [Sidenote: _Little Movements with Meanings All Their Own_]  1. Feet together, arms outstretched, palms up, describe as large a circle as possible. Fine for round shoulders and fat backs. Do slowly and stretch fifteen times. Smile.  2. Arms outstretched, swing to right and to left as far as possible at least 15 times each.  [Sidenote: _Important! Keep Facial Expression Throughout as per Artist's Idea_]  3. Bend sideways, to right and left, alternately, as far as possible at least 15 times each.  4. Revolve the body upon the hips from right to left at least 10 times, and left to right the same.  5. Bend and touch the floor with your fingers, without bending your knees, at least 15 times.  6. Knee-bending exercise, at least 15 times. This is hard at first.  7. Hand on door or wall, swing each leg back and forth at least 15 times. To the side 15 times. Turn head, raise arm, and tense both.  [Sidenote: _You Will Soon Be as Graceful as Annette_]  8. Step on chair with each foot at least 10 times. This is good for calf and thigh muscles. After a while you won't look as though you needed a derrick to get onto a street car.  9. Arms on sides of chair. Come down and touch abdomen. Fine for back and abdomen. Fifteen times.
