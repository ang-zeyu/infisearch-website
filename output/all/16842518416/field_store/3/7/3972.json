Again he cut little chips from the trees as he passed, but never ceased his swift and silent journey to the south. The hours fled by, and a dark shade appeared in the east. It deepened into dusk, and spread steadily toward the zenith. The sun, a golden ball, sank behind a hill in the west, and then the shiftless one stopped.  He ascended a low hill again, and took a long scrutinizing look around the whole horizon. But his gaze was not apprehensive. On the contrary, it was expectant, and his face seemed to show a slight disappointment when the wilderness merely presented its wonted aspect. Then he built another fire, not choosing a secluded glade, but the top of the hill, the most exposed spot that he could find, and, after he had eaten his supper, he sat beside it, the expectant air still on his face.  Nothing came. But the shiftless one sat long. He raked up dead leaves of last year's winter and made a pillow, against which he reclined luxuriously. Shif'less Sol was one who drew mental and physical comfort from every favoring circumstance, and the leaves felt very soft to his head and shoulders. He was not in the least lonesome, although the night had fully come, and heavy darkness lay like a black robe over the forest. He stretched out his moccasined toes to the fire, closed his eyes for a moment or two, and a dreamy look of satisfaction rested on his face. It seemed to the shiftless one that he lay in the very lap of luxury, in the very best of worlds.  But when he opened his eyes again he continued to watch the forest, or rather he watched with his ears now, as he lay close to the earth, and his hearing, at all times, was so acute that it seemed to border upon instinct or divination. But no sound save the usual ones of the forest and the night came to him, and he remained quite still, thinking.  Shif'less Sol Hyde was in an exalted mood, and the flickering firelight showed a face refined and ennobled by a great purpose. Leading a life that made him think little of hardship and danger he thought nothing at all of them now, but he felt instead a great buoyancy, and a hope equally great.  He lay awake a full three hours after the dark had come, and he rose only twice from his reclining position, each time merely to replenish the fire which remained a red core in the circling blackness. Always he was listening and always he heard nothing but the usual sounds of the forest and the night. The darkness grew denser and heavier, but after a while it began to thin and lighten. The sky became clear, and the great stars swam in the dusky blue. Then Shif'less Sol fell asleep, head on the leaves, feet to the fire, and slept soundly all through the night.  He was up at dawn, cooked his breakfast, and then, after another long and searching examination of the surrounding forest, departed, leaving the coals of the fire to smoulder, and tell as they might that some one had passed. Shif'less Sol throughout that morning repeated the tactics of the preceding day, leaving footprints that would last, and cutting pieces of bark from the trees with his sharp hatchet. At the noon hour he stopped, according to custom, and, just when he had lighted his fire, he uttered a low cry of pleasure.  The shiftless one was gazing back upon his own trail, and the singular look of exaltation upon his face deepened. He rose to his feet and stood, very erect, in the attitude of one who welcomes. No undergrowth was here, and he could see far down the aisles of trunks.  A figure, so distant that only a keen eye would notice it, was approaching. It came on swiftly and silently, much after the manner of the shiftless one himself, elastic, and instinct with strength.  The figure was that of a boy in years, but of a man in size, surpassing Shif'less Sol himself in height, yellow haired, blue-eyed, and dressed, too, in the neatest of forest garb. His whole appearance was uncommon, likely anywhere to attract attention and admiration. The shiftless one drew a long breath of mingled welcome and approval.  \"I knew that he would be first,\" he murmured.  Then he sat down and began to broil a juicy deer steak on the end of a sharpened stick.  Henry Ware came into the little glade. He had seen the fire afar and he knew who waited. All was plain to him like the print of a book, and, without a word, he dropped down on the other side of the fire facing Shif'less Sol. The two nodded, but their eyes spoke far more. Sol held out the steak, now crisp and brown and full of savor, and Henry began to eat. Sol quickly broiled another for himself, and joined him in the pleasant task, over which they were silent for a little while.  \"I was on the Ohio,\" said Henry at last, \"when the trapper brought me your message, but I started at once.\"  \"O' course,\" said Shif'less Sol, \"I never doubted it for a minute. I reckon that you've come about seven hundred miles.\"  \"Nearer eight,\" said Henry, \"but I'm fresh and strong, and we need all our strength, Sol, because it's a great task that lies before us.\"  \"It shorely is,\" said Sol, \"an' that's why I sent the message. I don't want to brag, Henry, but we've done a big thing or two before, an' maybe we kin do a bigger now.\"  He spoke the dialect of the border, he was not a man of books, but that great look of exaltation came into his face again, and the boy on the other side of the fire shared it.  \"It seems to me, Sol,\" said Henry presently, \"that we've been selected for work of a certain kind. We finish one job, and then another on the same line begins.\"  \"Mebbe it's because we like to do it, an' are fit fur it,\" said Sol philosophically. \"I've noticed that a river gen'ally runs in a bed that suits it. I don't know whether the bed is thar because the river is, or the river is thar 'cause the bed is, but it's shore that they're both thar together, an' you can't git aroun' that.\"  \"There's something in what you say,\" said Henry.  Then they relapsed into silence, and, in a half hour, as if by mutual consent, they rose, left the fire burning, and departed, still walking steadily toward the south.  The country grew rougher. The hills were higher and closer together, and the undergrowth became thick. Neither took any precautions as they passed among the slender bushes, frequently trampling them down and leaving signs that the blindest could not fail to see. Now and then the two looked back, but they beheld only the forest and the forest people.  \"I don't think I ever saw the game so tame before,\" said Henry.  \"Which means,\" said Sol, \"that the warriors ain't hunted here fur a long time. I ain't seen a single sign o' them.\"  \"Nor I.\"  They fell silent and scarcely spoke until the sun was setting again, when they stopped for the night, choosing a conspicuous place, as Sol had done the evening before. After supper, they sought soft places on the turf, and lay in peace, gazing up at the great stars. Henry was the first to break the silence.  \"One is coming,\" he said. \"I can hear the footstep. Listen!\"  His ear was to the earth, and the shiftless one imitated him. At the end of a minute he spoke.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I hear him, too. We'll make him welcome.\"  He rose, put a fresh piece of wood on the fire, and smiled, as he saw the flame leap up and crackle merrily.  \"Here he is,\" said Henry.  The figure that emerged from the bushes was thick-set and powerful, the strong face seamed and tanned by the wind, rain and sun of years. The man stepped into the circle of the firelight, and held out his hand. Each shook it with a firm and hearty clasp, and Tom Ross took his seat with them beside the fire. They handed him food first, and then he said:  \"I was away up in the Miami country, huntin' buffalo, when the word came to me, Sol, but I quit on the minute an' started.\"  \"I was shore you would,\" said the shiftless one quietly. \"Buffaloes are big game, but we're huntin' bigger now.\"  \"I was never in this part of the country before,\" said Tom Ross, looking around curiously at the ghostly tree trunks.  \"I've been through here,\" said Henry, \"and it runs on in the same way for hundreds of miles in every direction.\"  \"Bigger an' finer than any o' them old empires that Paul used to tell us about,\" said Shif'less Sol.  \"Yes,\" said Henry.  The three looked at one another significantly.  They wrapped themselves in their blankets by and by, and went to sleep on the soft turf. Henry was the first to awake, just when the dawn was turning from pink to red, and a single glance revealed to him an object on the horizon that had not been there the night before. A man stood on the crest of a low hill, and even at the distance, Henry recognized him. His comrades were awaking and he turned to them.  \"See!\" he said, pointing with a long forefinger.  Their eyes followed, and they too recognized the man.  \"He'll be here in a minute,\" said Shif'less Sol. \"He jest eats up space.\"  He spoke the truth, as it seemed scarcely a minute before Long Jim Hart entered the camp, showing no sign of fatigue. The three welcomed him and gave him a place at their breakfast fire.  \"I wuz at Marlowe,\" he said, \"when the word reached me, but I started just an hour later. I struck your trail, Sol, two days back, an' I traveled nearly all last night. I saw Henry join you an' then Tom.\"  Shif'less Sol laughed. He had a soft, mellow laugh that crinkled up the corners of his mouth, and made his eyes shine. There was no doubt that a man who laughed such a laugh was enjoying himself.  \"I reckon you didn't have much trouble follerin' that trail o' ourn,\" he said.  Jim Hart answered the laugh with a grin.  \"Not much,\" he replied. \"It was like a wagon road through the wilderness. The ashes uv your last camp fire weren't sca'cely cold when I passed by.\"  \"We're all here 'cept the fifth feller,\" said Tom Ross.  \"The fifth will come,\" said Henry emphatically.  \"Uv course,\" said Tom Ross with equal emphasis.  \"And when he comes,\" said Shif'less Sol, \"we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15055"],["title","The Free Rangers: A Story of the Early Days Along the Mississippi (#2)"],["body","right hold o' the big job.\"  They lingered awhile over their breakfast, but saw no one approaching. Then they took up the march again, going steadily southward in single file, talking little, but leaving a distinct trail. They were only four, but they were a formidable party, all strong of arm, keen of eye and ear, skilled in the lore of the forest, and every one bore the best weapons that the time could furnish.  Toward noon the day grew very warm and clouds gathered in the sky. The wind became damp.  \"Rain,\" said Henry. \"I'm sorry of that. I wish it wouldn't break before he overtook us.\"  \"S'pose we stop an' make ready,\" said Shif'less Sol. \"You know we ain't bound to be in a big hurry, an' it won't help any o' us to get a soakin'.\"  \"You're shorely right, Sol,\" said Jim Hart. \"We're bound to take the best uv care uv ourselves.\"  They looked around with expert eyes, and quickly chose a stony outcrop or hollow in the side of a hill, just above which grew two gigantic beeches very close together. Then it was wonderful to see them work, so swift and skillful were they. They cut small saplings with their hatchets, and, with the little poles and fallen bark of last year, made a rude thatch which helped out the thick branches of the beeches overhead. They also built up the sides of the hollow with the same materials, and the whole was done in less than ten minutes. Then they raked in heaps of dead leaves and sat down upon them comfortably. Many drops of water would come through the leaves and thatch, but such as they, hardened to the wilderness, would not notice them.  Meanwhile the storm was gathering with the rapidity so frequent in the great valley. All the little clouds swung together and made a big one that covered nearly the whole sky. The air darkened rapidly. Thunder began to growl and mutter and now and then emitted a sharp crash. Lightning cut the heavens from zenith to horizon, and the forest would leap into the light, standing there a moment, vivid, like tracery.  A blaze more brilliant than all the rest cleft wide the sky and, as they looked toward the North, they saw directly in the middle of the flame a black dot that had not been there before.  \"He's coming,\" said Henry in the quiet tone that indicated nothing more than a certainty fulfilled.  \"Just in time to take a seat in our house,\" said the shiftless one.  Sol ran out and gave utterance to a long echoing cry that sounded like a call. It was answered at once by the new black dot under the Northern horizon, which was now growing fast in size, as it came on rapidly. It took a human shape, and, thirty yards away, a fine, delicately-chiselled face, the face of a scholar and dreamer, remarkable in the wilderness, was revealed. The face belonged to a youth, tall and strong, but not so tall and large as Henry.  \"Here we are, Paul,\" said Shif'less Sol. \"We've fixed fur you.\"  \"And mighty glad I am to overtake you fellows,\" said Paul Cotter, \"particularly at this time.\"  He ran for the shelter just as the forest began to moan, and great drops of rain rushed down upon them. He was inside in a moment, and each gave his hand a firm grasp.  \"We're all here now,\" said Henry.  \"All here and ready for the great work,\" said Shif'less Sol, his tranquil face illumined again with that look of supreme exaltation.  Then the storm burst. The skies opened and dropped down floods of water. They heard it beating on the leaves and thatch overhead, and some came through, falling upon them but they paid no heed. They sat placidly until the rush and roar passed, and then Henry said to the others:  \"We're to stick to the task that we've set ourselves through thick and through thin, through everything?\"  \"Yes! Yes!\"  \"If one falls, the four that are left keep on?\"  \"Yes! yes!\"  \"If three fall and only two are left, these must not flinch.\"  \"Yes! yes!\"  \"If four go down and only one is left, then he whoever he may be, must go on and win alone?\"  \"Yes! yes!\" came forth with deep emphasis.     CHAPTER II  A FOREST ENVOY   A group of men were seated in a pleasant valley, where the golden beams of the sun sifted in myriads through the green leaves. They were about fifty in number and all were white. Most of them were dressed in Old World fashion, doublets, knee breeches, hose, and cocked hats. Nearly all were dark; olive faces, black hair, and black pointed beards, but now and then one had fair hair, and eyes of a cold, pale blue. Manner, speech, looks, and dress, alike differentiated them from the borderers. They were not the kind of men whom one would expect to find in these lonely woods in the heart of North America.  The leader of the company--and obviously he was such--was one of the few who belonged to the blonde type. His eyes were of the chilly, metallic blue, and his hair, long and fair, curled at the ends. His dress, of some fine, black cloth, was scrupulously neat and clean, and a silver-hilted small sword swung it his belt. He was not more than thirty.  The fair man was leaning lazily but gracefully against the trunk of a tree, and he talked in a manner that seemed indolent and careless, but which was neither to a youth in buckskins who sat opposite him, a striking contrast in appearance. This youth was undeniably of the Anglo-Saxon type, large and well-built, with a broad, full forehead, but with eyes set too close together. He was tanned almost to the darkness of an Indian.  \"You tell me, Se隳r Wyatt,\" said Don Francisco Alvarez, the leader of the Spanish band, \"that the new settlers in Kaintock[A] have twice driven off the allied tribes, and that, if they are left alone another year or two, they will go down so deep in the soil that they can never be uprooted. Is it not so?\"  \"It is so,\" replied Braxton Wyatt, the renegade. \"The tribes have failed twice in a great effort. Every man among these settlers is a daring and skillful fighter, and many of the boys--and many of the women, too. But if white troops and cannon are sent against them their forts must fall.\"  The Spaniard was idly whipping the grass stems with a little switch. Now he narrowed his metallic, blue eyes, and gazed directly into those of Braxton Wyatt.  \"And you, Se隳r Wyatt?\" he said, speaking his slow, precise English. \"Nothing premeditated is done without a motive. You are of these people who live in Kaintock, their blood is your blood; why then do you wish to have them destroyed?\"  A deep flush broke its way through the brown tan on the face of Braxton Wyatt, and his eyes fell before the cold gaze of the Spaniard. But he raised them again in a moment. Braxton Wyatt was not a coward, and he never permitted a guilty conscience to last longer than a throb or two.  \"I did belong to them,\" he replied, \"but my tastes led me away. I have felt that all this mighty valley should belong to the Indians who have inhabited it so long, but, if the white people come, it should be those who are true and loyal to their kings, not these rebels of the colonies.\"  Francisco Alvarez smiled cynically, and once more surveyed Braxton Wyatt, with a rapid, measuring glance.  \"You speak my sentiments, Se隳r Wyatt,\" he said, \"and you speak them in a language that I scarcely expected.\"  \"I had a schoolmaster even in the wilderness,\" said Braxton Wyatt. \"And I may tell you, too, as proof of my faith that I would be hanged at once should I return to the settlements.\"  \"I do not doubt your faith. I was merely curious about your motives. I am sure also that you can be of great help to us.\"  He spoke in a patronizing manner, and Braxton Wyatt moved slightly in anger, but restrained his speech.  \"I may say,\" continued the Spaniard, \"that His Excellency Bernardo Galvez, His Most Catholic Majesty's Governor of his loyal province of Louisiana, has been stirred by the word that comes to him of these new settlements of the rebel Americans in the land of the Ohio. The province of Louisiana is vast, and it may be that it includes the country on either side of the Ohio. The French, our predecessors, claimed it, and now that all the colonists east of the mountains are busy fighting their king, it may be easy to take it from them, as one would snip off a skirt with a pair of scissors. That is why I and this faithful band are so far north in these woods.\"  Braxton Wyatt nodded.  \"And a wise thing, too,\" he said. \"I am strong with the tribes. The great chief, Yellow Panther, of the Miamis and the great chief, Red Eagle, of the Shawnees are both my friends. I know how they feel. The Spanish in New Orleans are far away. Their settlements do not spread. They come rather to hunt and trade. But the Americans push farther and farther. They build their homes and they never go back. Do you wonder then that the warriors wish your help?\"  Francisco Alvarez smiled again. It was a cold but satisfied smile and he rubbed one white hand over the other.  \"Your logic is good,\" he said, \"and these reasons have occurred to me, also, but my master, Bernardo Galvez, the Governor, is troubled. We love not England and there is a party among us--a party at present in power--which wishes to help the Americans in order that we may damage England, but I, if I could choose the way would have no part in it. As surely as we help the rebels we will also create rebels against ourselves.\"  \"You are far from New Orleans,\" said Braxton Wyatt. \"It would take long for a messenger to go and come, and meanwhile you could act as you think best.\"  \"It is so,\" said the Spaniard. \"Our presence here is unknown to all save the chiefs and yourself. In this wilderness, a thousand miles from his superior, one must act according to his judgment, and I should like to see these rebel settlements crushed.\"  He spoke to himself rather than to Wyatt, and again his eyes narrowed. Blue eyes are generally warm and sympathetic, but his were of the cold, metallic shade that can express cruelty so well. He plucked, too, at his short, light beard, and Braxton Wyatt read his thoughts. The renegade felt "]]]
