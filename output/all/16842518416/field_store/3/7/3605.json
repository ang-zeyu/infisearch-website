Spiritually, Christmas Day recurs exactly seven times a week. When we have frankly acknowledged this, and acted on this, we shall begin to realise the Day's mystical and terrific beauty. For it is only every-day things that reveal themselves to us in all their wonder and their splendour. A man who happens one day to be knocked down by a motor-bus merely utters a curse and instructs his solicitor, but a man who has been knocked down by a motor-bus every day of the year will have begun to feel that he is taking part in an august and soul-cleansing ritual. He will await the diurnal stroke of fate with the same lowly and pious joy as animated the Hindoos awaiting Juggernaut. His bruises will be decorations, worn with the modest pride of the veteran. He will cry aloud, in the words of the late W.E. Henley, \"My head is bloody but unbowed.\" He will add, \"My ribs are broken but unbent.\"  I look for the time when we shall wish one another a Merry Christmas every morning; when roast turkey and plum-pudding shall be the staple of our daily dinner, and the holly shall never be taken down from the walls, and everyone will always be kissing everyone else under the mistletoe. And what is right as regards Christmas is right as regards all other so-called anniversaries. The time will come when we shall dance round the Maypole every morning before breakfast--a meal at which hot-cross buns will be a standing dish--and shall make April fools of one another every day before noon. The profound significance of All Fool's Day--the glorious lesson that we are all fools--is too apt at present to be lost. Nor is justice done to the sublime symbolism of Shrove Tuesday--the day on which all sins are shriven. Every day pancakes shall be eaten, either before or after the plum-pudding. They shall be eaten slowly and sacramentally. They shall be fried over fires tended and kept for ever bright by Vestals. They shall be tossed to the stars.  I shall return to the subject of Christmas next week.     A SEQUELULA TO \"THE DYNASTS\"[7]  _By_  TH*M*S H*RDY  [Footnote 7: _This has been composed from a scenario thrust on me   by some one else.

Our own Solar System is visible,     distant by some two million miles.    Enter the Ancient Spirit and Chorus of the Years, the Spirit     and Chorus of the Pities, the Spirit Ironic, the Spirit     Sinister, Rumours, Spirit-Messengers, and the Recording Angel.   SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _Yonder, that swarm of things insectual_   _Wheeling Nowhither in Particular--_   _What is it?_  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.              _That?

On close survey_   _You see these movesome. Do you not recall,_   _We once went in a party and beheld_   _All manner of absurd things happening_   _On one of those same--planets, don't you call them?_  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS (screwing up his eyes at the Solar System).    _One of that very swarm it was, if I mistake not._   _It had a parasite that called itself_   _Napol√©on.

Mr. Hardy_   _Saw that if that was so, well then, of course,_   _Obviously the only thing to do_   _Was to write no more novels, and forthwith_   _Applied himself to drama, and to Us._  SPIRIT IRONIC.    _Let us hear what he said about Us._  THE OTHER SPIRITS.              _Let's._  RECORDING ANGEL (raising receiver of aerial telephone).    _3 oh 4 oh oh 3 5, Space....

Enter Spirit-Messenger, with copy of \"The Dynasts.\"              _Thanks._    Exit Spirit-Messenger. The Recording Angel reads \"The Dynasts\"     aloud.    Just as the reading draws to a close, enter the Spirit of Mr.     Clement Shorter and Chorus of Subtershorters. They are visible     as small grey transparencies swiftly interpenetrating the     brains of the spatial Spirits.  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _It is a book which, once you take it up,_   _You cannot readily lay down._  SPIRIT SINISTER.              _There is_   _Not a dull page in it._  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.              _A bold conception_   _Outcarried with that artistry for which_   _The author's name is guarantee. We have_   _No hesitation in commending to our readers_   _A volume which--_    The Spirit of Mr. Clement Shorter and Chorus of Subtershorters     are detected and expelled.              _--we hasten to denounce_   _As giving an entirely false account_   _Of our impressions._  SPIRIT IRONIC.      Hear, _hear_!  SPIRIT SINISTER.          Hear, _hear_!  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.              _Hear_!  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.    _Intensive vision has this Mr. Hardy,_   _With a dark skill in weaving word-patterns_   _Of subtle ideographies that mark him_   _A man of genius. So am not I,_   _But a plain Spirit, simple and forthright,_   _With no damned philosophical fal-lals_   _About me. When I visited that planet_   _And watched the animalculae thereon,_   _I never said they were \"automata\"_   _And \"jackaclocks,\" nor dared describe their deeds_   _As \"Life's impulsion by Incognizance.\"_   _It may be that those mites have no free will,_   _But how should I know? Nay, how Mr. Hardy?_   _We cannot glimpse the origin of things,_   _Cannot conceive a Causeless Cause, albeit_   _Such a Cause must have been, and must be greater_   _Than we whose little wits cannot conceive it._   _\"Incognizance\"! Why deem incognizant_   _An infinitely higher than ourselves?_   _How dare define its way with us? How know_   _Whether it leaves us free or holds us bond?_  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _Allow me to associate myself_   _With every word that's fallen from your lips._   _The author of \"The Dynasts\" has indeed_   _Misused his undeniably great gifts_   _In striving to belittle things that are_   _Little enough already. I don't say_   _That the phrenetical behaviour_   _Of those aforesaid animalculae_   _Did, while we watched them, seem to indicate_   _Possession of free-will. But, bear in mind,_   _We saw them in peculiar circumstances--_   _At war, blinded with blood and lust and fear._   _Is it not likely that at other times_   _They are quite decent midgets, capable_   _Of thinking for themselves, and also acting_   _Discreetly on their own initiative,_   _Not drilled and herded, yet gregarious--_   _A wise yet frolicsome community?_  SPIRIT IRONIC.    _What are these \"other times\" though? I had thought_   _Those midgets whiled away the vacuous hours_   _After one war in training for the next._   _And let me add that my contempt for them_   _Is not done justice to by Mr. Hardy._  SPIRIT SINISTER.    _Nor mine. And I have reason to believe_   _Those midgets shone above their average_   _When we inspected them._  A RUMOUR (tactfully intervening).              _Yet have I heard_   _(Though not on very good authority)_   _That once a year they hold a festival_   _And thereat all with one accord unite_   _In brotherly affection and good will._  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS (to Recording Angel).    _Can you authenticate this Rumour?_  RECORDING ANGEL.    _Such festival they have, and call it \"Christmas.\"_  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _Then let us go and reconsider them_   _Next \"Christmas.\"_  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS (to Recording Angel).            _When is that?_  RECORDING ANGEL (consults terrene calendar).              _This day three weeks._  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.    _On that day we will re-traject ourselves._   _Meanwhile, 'twere well we should be posted up_   _In details of this feast._  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES (to Recording Angel).              _Aye, tell us more._  RECORDING ANGEL.    _I fancy you could best find what you need_   _In the Complete Works of the late Charles Dickens._   _I have them here._  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.              _Read them aloud to us._    The Recording Angel reads aloud the Complete Works of Charles     Dickens.

There is the sound of a rushing wind. The Solar System is seen     for a few instants growing larger and larger--a whorl of dark,     vastening orbs careering round the sun. All but one of these     is lost to sight. The convex seas and continents of our planet     spring into prominence.    The Spirit of Mr. Hardy is visible as a grey transparency     swiftly interpenetrating the brain of the Spirit of the Years,     and urging him in a particular direction, to a particular     point.    The Aerial Visitants now hover in mid-air on the outskirts of     Casterbridge, Wessex, immediately above the County Gaol.  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.    _First let us watch the revelries within_   _This well-kept castle whose great walls connote_   _A home of the pre-eminently blest._    The roof of the gaol becomes transparent, and the whole     interior is revealed, like that of a beehive under glass.     Warders are marching mechanically round the corridors of     white stone, unlocking and clanging open the iron doors of     the cells. Out from every door steps a convict, who stands at     attention, his face to the wall.    At a word of command the convicts fall into gangs of twelve,     and march down the stone stairs, out into the yard, where they     line up against the walls.    Another word of command, and they file mechanically, but not     more mechanically than their warders, into the Chapel.  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _Enough!_  SPIRITS SINISTER AND IRONIC.          _'Tis more than even we can bear._  SPIRIT OF THE PITIES.    _Would we had never come!_  SPIRIT OF THE YEARS.              _Brother, 'tis well_   _To have faced a truth however hideous,_   _However humbling. Gladly I discipline_   _My pride by taking back those pettish doubts_   _Cast on the soundness of the central thought_   _In Mr. Hardy's drama. He was right._   _Automata these animalculae_   _Are--puppets, pitiable jackaclocks._   _Be't as it may elsewhere, upon this planet_   _There's no free will, only obedience_   _To some blind, deaf, unthinking despotry_   _That justifies the horridest pessimism._   _Frankly acknowledging all this, I beat_   _A quick but not disorderly retreat._    He re-trajects himself into Space, followed closely by his     Chorus, and by the Spirit and Chorus of the Pities, the     Spirits Sinister and Ironic with their Choruses, Rumours,     Spirit Messengers, and the Recording Angel.     SHAKESPEARE AND CHRISTMAS  _By_  FR*NK H*RR*S   That Shakespeare hated Christmas--hated it with a venom utterly alien to the gentle heart in him--I take to be a proposition that establishes itself automatically. If there is one thing lucid-obvious in the Plays and Sonnets, it is Shakespeare's unconquerable loathing of Christmas. The Professors deny it, however, or deny that it is proven. With these gentlemen I will deal faithfully. I will meet them on their own parched ground, making them fertilise it by shedding there the last drop of the water that flows through their veins.  If you find, in the works of a poet whose instinct is to write about everything under the sun, one obvious theme untouched, or touched hardly at all, then it is at least presumable that there was some good reason for that abstinence. Such a poet was Shakespeare. It was one of the divine frailties of his genius that he must be ever flying off at a tangent from his main theme to unpack his heart in words about some frivolous-small irrelevance that had come into his head. If it could be shown that he never mentioned Christmas, we should have proof presumptive that he consciously avoided doing so. But if the fact is that he did mention it now and again, but in grudging fashion, without one spark of illumination--he, the arch-illuminator of all things--then we have proof positive that he detested it.  I see Dryasdust thumbing his Concordance. Let my memory save him the trouble. I will reel him off the one passage in which Shakespeare spoke of Christmas in words that rise to the level of mediocrity.    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes   Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,   The bird of dawning singeth all night long:   And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;   The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,   No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,   So hallowed and so gracious is the time.  So says Marcellus at Elsinore. This is the best our Shakespeare can vamp up for the birthday of the Man with whom he of all men had the most in common. And Dryasdust, eternally unable to distinguish chalk from cheese, throws up his hands in admiration of the marvellous poetry. If Dryasdust had written it, it would more than pass muster. But as coming from Shakespeare, how feeble-cold--aye, and sulky-sinister! The greatest praiser the world will ever know!--and all he can find in his heart to sing of Christmas is a stringing-together of old women's superstitions! Again and again he has painted Winter for us as it never has been painted since--never by Goethe even, though Goethe in more than one of the _Winter-Lieder_ touched the hem of his garment. There was every external reason why he should sing, as only he could have sung, of Christmas. The Queen set great store by it. She and her courtiers celebrated it year by year with lusty-pious unction. And thus the ineradicable snob in Shakespeare had the most potent of all inducements to honour the feast with the full power that was in him. But he did not, because he would not. What is the key to the enigma?  For many years I hunted it vainly. The second time that I met Carlyle I tried to enlist his sympathy and aid. He sat pensive for a while and then said that it seemed to him \"a goose-quest.\" I replied, \"You have always a phrase for everything, Tom, but always the wrong one.\" He covered his face, and presently, peering at me through his gnarled fingers, said \"Mon, ye're recht.\" I discussed the problem with Renan, with Emerson, with Disraeli, also with Cetewayo--poor Cetewayo, best and bravest of men, but intellectually a Professor, like the rest of them. It was borne in on me that if I were to win to the heart of the mystery I must win alone.  The solution, when suddenly it dawned on me, was so simple-stark that I was ashamed of the ingenious-clever ways I had been following. (I learned then--and perhaps it is the one lesson worth the learning of any man--that truth may be approached only through the logic of the heart. For the heart is eye and ear, and all excellent understanding abides there.) On Christmas Day, assuredly, Anne Hathaway was born.  In what year she was born I do not know nor care. I take it she was not less than thirty-eight when she married Shakespeare. This, however, is sheer conjecture, and in no way important-apt to our inquiry. It is not the year, but the day of the year, that matters. All we need bear in mind is that on Christmas Day that woman was born into the world.  If there be any doubting Thomas among my readers, let him not be afraid to utter himself. I am (with the possible exception of Shakespeare) the gentlest man that ever breathed, and I do but bid him study the Plays in the light I have given him. The first thing that will strike him is that Shakespeare's thoughts turned constantly to the birthdays of all his Fitton-heroines, as a lover's thoughts always do turn to the moment at which the loved one first saw the light. \"There was a star danced, and under that\" was born Beatrice. Juliet was born \"on Lammas Eve.\" Marina tells us she derived her name from the chance of her having been \"born at sea.\" And so on, throughout the whole gamut of women in whom Mary Fitton was bodied forth to us. But mark how carefully Shakespeare says never a word about the birthdays of the various shrews and sluts in whom, again and again, he gave us his wife. When and were was born Queen Constance, the scold? And Bianca? And Doll Tearsheet, and \"Greasy Jane\" in the song, and all the rest of them? It is of the last importance that we should know. Yet never a hint is vouchsafed us in the text. It is clear that Shakespeare cannot bring himself to write about Anne Hathaway's birthday--will not stain his imagination by thinking of it. That is entirely human-natural. But why should he loathe Christmas Day itself with precisely the same loathing? There is but one answer--and that inevitable-final. The two days were one.  Some soul-secrets are so terrible that the most hardened realist of us may well shrink from laying them bare. Such a soul-secret was this of Shakespeare's. Think of it! The gentlest spirit that ever breathed, raging and fuming endlessly in impotent-bitter spleen against the prettiest of festivals! Here is a spectacle so tragic-piteous that, try as we will, we shall not put it from us. And it is well that we should not, for in our plenary compassion we shall but learn to love the man the more.      [Mr. Fr*nk H*rr*s is very much a man of genius, and I should     be sorry if this adumbration of his manner made any one     suppose that I do not rate his writings about Shakespeare     higher than those of all \"the Professors\" together.--M.B.]     SCRUTS  _By_  ARN*LD B*NN*TT   I.
