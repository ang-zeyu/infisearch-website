The least pleasant part of this ceremony may be comprised in the word curl-papers. Ida's hair was dark, and soft, and smooth, but other little girls wore ringlets, and so this little girl must wear ringlets too. To that end her hair was every night put into curl-papers, with much tight twisting and sharp jerking, and Ida slept upon an irregular layer of small paper parcels, which made pillows a mockery. With all this, however, a damp day, or a good romp, would sometimes undo the night's work, to the great disgust of Nurse. In her last place, the young lady's hair had curled with a damp brush, as Ida well knew, and Nurse made so much of her own grievance, in having to use the curl-papers, that no place was left for Ida's grievance in having to sleep upon them. She submitted this night therefore, as other nights, in patience, and sat swinging her feet and accommodating her head to the sharp tugs, which always seemed to come from unexpected quarters. Perhaps, however, her mind may have been running a little upon grievances, which made her say:  \"You know, Nursey, how you are always telling me I ought to be thankful for having things, and not having things, and--\"  \"I wish you'd talk sense, and not give way with your head so when I pull, Miss Ida,\" retorted Nurse, \"having things, and not having things; I don't know what you mean.\"  \"Well, you know, Nursey, the other day when I said I didn't like bread-and-treacle treacled so long before, and soaked in, and you said I ought to be thankful that I had bread-and-treacle at all, and that I hadn't a wooden leg, and to eat anything I could get, like the old sailor man at the corner; well, do you know, I've thought of something I _am_ so thankful for, and that is that I haven't a red screen to my bed.\"  \"I really do think, Miss Ida,\" said Nurse, \"that you'll go out of your mind some day, with your outlandish fancies. And where you get them, I can't think. I'm sure _I_ never put such things into your head.\"  Ida laughed again.  \"Never mind, Nursey, it all belongs to the pug story. Am I done now? And when you've tucked me up, please, would you mind remembering to put the flower where I can see it when I wake?\"  Nurse did as she was asked, and Ida watched the hyacinth till she fell asleep; and she slept well.  In the morning she took her old post at the window. The little old lady had never seemed so long in making her appearance, nor the bells so slow to begin. Chim! chime! chim! chime! There they were at last, and there was Mrs. Overtheway. She looked up, waved a bunch of snowdrops, and went after the bells. Ida kissed her hand, and waved it over and over again, long after the little old lady was out of sight.  \"There's a kiss for you, dear Mrs. Overtheway,\" she cried, \"and kisses for your flowers, and your house, and everything belonging to you, and for the bells and the church, and everybody in it this morning, and--\"  But, at this point of universal benevolence, Nurse carried her off to breakfast.  The little old lady came to tea as before. She looked as well as ever, and Nurse was equally generous in the matter of tea and toast. Mrs. Overtheway told over again what Ida had missed in the story of Mrs. Moss, and Ida apologized, with earnest distress, for her uncivil conduct in falling asleep.  \"There I was snoring away, when you were telling me such a delightful story!\" she exclaimed, penitently.  \"Not snoring exactly, my dear,\" smiled the little old lady, \"but you looked very happy.\"  \"I thought Nursey said so,\" said Ida. \"Well, I'm very glad. It would have been too rude. And you know I don't know how it was, for I _am_ so fond of stories; I like nothing so well.\"  \"Well, shall I try again?\" said Mrs. Overtheway. \"Perhaps I may find a more amusing one, and if it does put you to sleep, it won't do any harm. Indeed, I think the doctor will say I'm very good company for you.\"  \"You are very good! That _I_ can tell him,\" said Ida, fervently, \"and please let it be about yourself again, if you can remember anything. I like true stories.\"  \"Talking of snoring,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"reminds me of something that happened in my youth, and it is true, though, do you know, it is a ghost story.\"  Ida danced in her chair.  \"That is just what I should like!\" she exclaimed. \"Nurse has a ghost story, belonging to a farm-house, which she tells the housemaid, but she says she can't tell me till I am older, and I should so like to hear a ghost story, if it isn't too horrid.\"  \"This ghost story isn't too horrid, I think,\" laughed the little old lady, \"and if you will let me think a few minutes, and then forgive my prosy way of telling it, you shall have it at once.\"  There was a pause. The little old lady sat silent, and so sat Ida also, with her eyes intently fixed on Mrs. Overtheway's face, over which an occasional smile was passing.  \"It's about a ghost who snored,\" said the little old lady, doubtfully.  \"Delicious!\" responded Ida. The two friends settled themselves comfortably, and in some such words as these was told the following story:--     THE SNORING GHOST.       _Clown._ Madman, thou errest: I say there is no darkness but      Ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians      in their fog.... What is the opinion of Pythagoras      concerning wild fowl?       _Malvolio._ That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit      a bird.       _Clown._ What thinkest thou of his opinion?       _Malvolio_. I think nobly of the soul, and in no way approve      his opinion.       _Twelfth Night_, iv. 2.   \"I remember,\" said Mrs. Overtheway, \"I remember my first visit. That is, I remember the occasion when I and my sister Fatima did, for the first time in our lives, go out visiting without our mother, or any grown-up person to take care of us.\"  \"Do you remember your mother?\" asked Ida.  \"Quite well, my dear, I am thankful to say. The best and kindest of mothers!\"  \"Was your father alive, too?\" Ida asked, with a sigh.  The old lady paused, pitying the anxious little face opposite, but Ida went on eagerly:  \"Please tell me what _he_ was like.\"  \"He was a good deal older than my mother, who had married very early. He was a very learned man. His tastes and accomplishments were many and various, and he was very young-hearted and enthusiastic in the pursuit of them all his life. He was apt to take up one subject of interest after another, and to be for the time completely absorbed in it. And, I must tell you, that whatever the subject might be, so long as his head was full of it, the house seemed full of it too. It influenced the conversation at meals, the habits of the household, the names of the pet animals, and even of the children. I was called Mary, in a fever of chivalrous enthusiasm for the fair and luckless Queen of Scotland, and Fatima received her name when the study of Arabic had brought about an eastern mania. My father had wished to call her Shahraz√°d, after the renowned sultana of the 'Arabian Nights' but when he called upon the curate to arrange for the baptism, that worthy man flatly rebelled. A long discussion ended in my father's making a list of eastern names, from which the curate selected that of Fatima as being least repugnant to the sobriety of the parish registers. So Fatima she was called, and as she grew up pale, and moon-faced, and dark-eyed, the name became her very well.\"  \"Was it this Fatima who went out visiting with you?\" asked Ida.  \"Yes, my dear; and now as to the visit. The invitation came on my thirteenth birthday.  \"One's birthday is generally a day of some importance. A very notable day whilst one is young, but less so when one is old, when one is being carried quickly through the last stages of life, and when it seems hardly worth while to count time so near the end of the journey. Even in youth, however some birthdays are more important than others. I remember looking forward to my tenth birthday as to a high point of dignity and advancement; and the just pride of the occasion on which I first wrote my age with more figures than one. With similar feelings, I longed to be thirteen. The being able to write my age with two figures had not, after all, shed any special lustre upon life; but when I was 'in my teens' it must 'feel different somehow.' So I thought. Moreover, this birthday was really to bring with it solid advantages. I was now to be allowed to read certain books of a more grown-up character than I had read hitherto, and to sit up till nine o'clock. I was to wear sandals to my shoes. My hair was henceforth to grow as long as I and the Fates would permit, and the skirts of my frocks were to take an inch in the same direction. 'In four more years,' I said to Fatima, as we sat on the eve of my birthday, discussing its manifold advantages, 'in four more years I shall be grown up. Miss Ansted was introduced at seventeen.' The prospect was illimitable.  \"'Do people always grow much on their birthdays?' asked one of the little ones. I had boasted in the nursery, that when I was thirteen I should be 'nearly grown up,' and I myself had hardly outlived the idea that on one's birthday one was a year older than on the previous day, and might naturally expect to have made a year's growth during the night.  \"This birthday, however, produced no such striking change. As usual, the presents were charming; the wreath as lovely as Fatima's deft fingers could make it, the general holiday and pleasure-making almost too much of a good thing. Otherwise, there was little to mark it from other days in the year.  \"Towards evening we were all sitting on the grass, the boys with their heads on the sisters' laps, and there had been an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],["title","The Poetry of Architecture (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net           THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN RUSKIN  VOLUME I   POETRY OF ARCHITECTURE  SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE    [Illustration: J.

Of this work Mr. RUSKIN says in his Autobiography:--\"The idea had come into my head in the summer of '37, and, I imagine, rose immediately out of my sense of the contrast between the cottages of Westmoreland and those of Italy. Anyhow, the November number of Loudon's _Architectural Magazine_ for 1837 opens with 'Introduction to the Poetry of Architecture; or the Architecture of the Nations of Europe considered in its Association with Natural Scenery and National Character,' by Kata Phusin. I could not have put in fewer, or more inclusive words, the definition of what half my future life was to be spent in discoursing of; while the _nom-de-plume_ I chose, 'ACCORDING TO NATURE,' was equally expressive of the temper in which I was to discourse alike on that, and every other subject. The adoption of a _nom-de-plume_ at all implied (as also the concealment of name on the first publication of 'Modern Painters') a sense of a power of judgment in myself, which it would not have been becoming in a youth of eighteen to claim....\"  \"As it is, these youthful essays, though deformed by assumption, and shallow in contents, are curiously right up to the points they reach; and already distinguished above most of the literature of the time, for the skill of language, which the public at once felt for a pleasant gift in me.\" (_Pr√¶terita_, vol. I. chap. 12.)  In a paper on \"My First Editor,\" written in 1878, Mr. Ruskin says of these essays that they \"contain sentences nearly as well put together as any I have done since.\"  The Conductor of the _Architectural Magazine_ in reviewing the year's work said (December, 1838):--\"One series of papers, commenced in the last volume and concluded in the present one, we consider to be of particular value to the young architect. We allude to the 'Essays on the Poetry of Architecture,' by Kata Phusin. These essays will afford little pleasure to the mere builder, or to the architect who has no principle of guidance but precedent; but for such readers they were never intended. They are addressed to the young and unprejudiced artist; and their great object is to induce him to think and to exercise his reason.... There are some, we trust, of the rising generation, who are able to free themselves from the trammels and architectural bigotry of Vitruvius and his followers; and it is to such alone that we look forward for any real improvement in architecture as an art of design and taste.\"  The essays are in two parts: the first describing the cottages of England, France, Switzerland, and Italy, and giving hints and directions for picturesque cottage-building. The second part treats of the villas of Italy and England--with special reference to Como and Windermere; and concludes with a discussion of the laws of artistic composition, and practical suggestions of interest to the builders of country-houses.  It was the Author's original intention to have proceeded from the cottage and the villa to the higher forms of Architecture; but the Magazine to which he contributed was brought to a close shortly after the completion of his chapters on the villa, and his promise of farther studies was not redeemed until ten years later, by the publication of _The Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and still more completely in _The Stones of Venice_.  Other papers contributed by Mr. Ruskin to the same Magazine, on Perspective, and on the proposed monument to Sir Walter Scott at Edinburgh, are not included in this volume, as they do not form any part of the series on the Poetry of Architecture.  The text is carefully reprinted from the _Architectural Magazine_. A few additional notes are distinguished by square brackets.  A few of the old cuts, necessary to the text, are reproduced, and some are replaced by engravings from sketches by the Author. Possessors of the _Architectural Magazine_, vol. V., will be interested in comparing the wood-cut of the cottage in Val d'Aosta (p. 104 of that volume) with the photogravure from the original pencil drawing, which faces p. 21 of this work. It is much to be regretted that the original of the Coniston Hall (fig. 8; p. 50 of this work) has disappeared, and that the Author's youthful record of a scene so familiar to him in later years should be represented only by the harsh lines of Mr. Loudon's engraver.  THE EDITOR.     INTRODUCTION.   1. The Science of Architecture, followed out to its full extent, is one of the noblest of those which have reference only to the creations of human minds. It is not merely a science of the rule and compass, it does not consist only in the observation of just rule, or of fair proportion: it is, or ought to be, a science of feeling more than of rule, a ministry to the mind, more than to the eye. If we consider how much less the beauty and majesty of a building depend upon its pleasing certain prejudices of the eye, than upon its rousing certain trains of meditation in the mind, it will show in a moment how many intricate questions of feeling are involved in the raising of an edifice; it will convince us of the truth of a proposition, which might at first have appeared startling, that no man can be an architect, who is not a metaphysician.  2. To the illustration of the department of this noble science which may be designated the Poetry of Architecture, this and some future articles will be dedicated. It is this peculiarity of the art which constitutes its nationality; and it will be found as interesting as it is useful, to trace in the distinctive characters of the architecture of nations, not only its adaptation to the situation and climate in which it has arisen, but its strong similarity to, and connection with, the prevailing turn of mind by which the nation who first employed it is distinguished.  3. I consider the task I have imposed upon myself the more necessary, because this department of the science, perhaps regarded by some who have no ideas beyond stone and mortar as chimerical, and by others who think nothing necessary but truth and proportion as useless, is at a miserably low ebb in England. And what is the consequence? We have Corinthian columns placed beside pilasters of no order at all, surmounted by monstrosified pepper-boxes, Gothic in form and Grecian in detail, in a building nominally and peculiarly \"National\"; we have Swiss cottages, falsely and calumniously so entitled, dropped in the brick-fields round the metropolis; and we have staring square-windowed, flat-roofed gentlemen's seats, of the lath and plaster, mock-magnificent, Regent's Park description, rising on the woody promontories of Derwentwater.  4. How deeply is it to be regretted, how much is it to be wondered at, that, in a country whose school of painting, though"]]]
