I mention this to increase the wonder, and reinforce your felicity. Empires passe, Kingdomes are translated, and dominions cease: The _Cecropides_ of old, the _Arsacides_, the _Theban_, _Corinthian_, _Syracusian_, and sundry more lasted nor to the fourth Age without strange and prodigious tragedies; but why go we so far back, when a few Centuries present us with so many fresh Revolutions? How many nests has the _Roman_ Eagle changed? _Bulgarian_, _Saracen_, _Latine_; In the _Comneni_, _Isaaci_, _Paleologi_, &c. even till it dash'd it self in pieces against the _Oetoman_ rock. What mutations have been in the house of _Arragon_? How many Riders has the _Parthenopean_ horse unsaddl'd and flung? How many _Sicily_? What changes have been in _Italy_, What in _France_, and indeed through all _Europe_ by _Vandals_, _Saxons_, _Danes_, _Normans_, by external invasion, internal Faction, Envy, Ambition, treachery and violence? The _Consulate_ degenerated into _Oligarchy_, which occasion'd the _Aventine_ sedition; Democraty into _Ochlocraty_ under the _Tribunes_ and wicked _Gracchi_; and _Monarchy_ it self, (the very best of Governments) into Tyranny.  Indeed your sacred Majesty was cast out of your Kingdoms, but could never be thrown out of our hearts; There, you had a secure seat; and the Prince that is inthron'd there, is safe in all mutations; Keep there Sir, and you are inexpugnable, immoveable. And how should it otherwayes be? A Prince of your virtue could not miscarry, that being truly verified of Your Majesty, as well in your perfections, as your person, _Certe, videtis quem elegit Dominus in Regem, quoniam non sit similis illi in omni populo._ Nature design'd your Majesty a King, Fortune makes others; nor are you more your peoples by birth, and a glorious _series_ of Progenitors, then by your merits: This appeared in all those digits of your darkest Eclipse; The defect was ours, not your Majesties. For the Sun is alwaies shining, though men alwaies see him not; and since the too great splendor, and prosperity did confound us, it pleased God to interpose those clouds, till we should be better able to behold you with more reverence and security; For then it was that you prepar'd your self for this weighty government, and gave us those presages of your Virtue, by what you did, for your people, and what you suffered for them; signalizing your Courage, your Fortitude, Constancy, Piety, Prudence and Temperance upon all occasions. Your Travels and Adventures are as far beyond those of _Ulysses_, as you exceed him in Dominions; _Si quis enim velit percensere Cæsaris res, totum profecto terrarum orbem enumeret_: For he must go very far that would sum up your perfections: Your skill in the customes of Nations, the situations of Kingdomes, the Advantages of places, the temper of the Climates; so as the Ages to come shall tell with delight, where you fought valiantly, where you suffered gallantly, _Quis sudores tuos hauserit campus, quæ refectiones tuas arbores, quæ somnum saxa prætexerint, quod denique tectum magnus hospes impleveris_, and all those sacred _Vestigia_ of yours: Thus what was once applyed to _Trajan_, becomes due to your Majesty, and I my self am witness both abroad, and at home, of what I pronounce, having now beheld you in both fortunes with love and admiration; But this is not halfe, and to stop at single perfections, were to give jealousie to the rest yet untouched, and should I but succinctly number them all, were not to weave a Panegyrick, but an Inventory.  But amongst all your Vertues none was more eminent then your constancy to your religion, which no shocks of Fortune, no assaults of sophisters, events and successe of adversaries, or offers of specious Friends could shake; so great a thing it was that you did persevere, so much greater _quod non timuisti ne perseverare non posses_.  But whilst Armies on earth fought for the Usurper, the Hosts of Heaven fought in their courses for your Majesty; [SN: _Spaine._] dashing your greatest enemy upon that Rock, which afforded you shelter, till that Tyranny was over past: And how welcome to Us was that blessed day _qui tyrannum abstulit pessimum, Principem dedit optimum_! He liv'd by storming others, dyed in one himself, _& post Nubila, Phoebus_. Yet did not that quite dissolve our fears, till that other head of _Hydra_ was cut off, that despicable Rump which succeeded, not by the sword, or any humane addresse, least we should sacrifice to our own Nets; but by the immediate hand of heaven, without noise, without Armes, or stratageme, the fame of your vertues, more then the sense of our own misery, universally turning the hearts even of your very Enemies; and then that Northern Star began the dawning of this day, till your nearer approach did guild our Horizon, brighter then the rayes of the Eastern sun, from whose spicy coast, like a true Phoenix you were to come; For so at the sight of that Royal Bird was the memory of _Sesostris_, of _Amasis_ and _Ptolemy_ ever fortunate, and so was yours to us;      _----Tum rusticus ergo     Suspicit observans volucrem; nam creditur annus     Ille salutaris----_  the happy presages of our glorious Returne, stupendious indeed and almost indicible: For no sooner did your _Argo_ hoise sail, that the Eagles themselves fled not swifter, then the report of your approach from ten thousand mouthes of brasse, echoing from ship to ship, and shore to shore, with their thundring voices, out done yet with the shouts and acclamations of your glad people, when our shaken Republique rushed at once into your princely Armes for safety and _Asylum_, not by the occult power of Destiny, or blind revolution, but the extraordinary hand of Providence, whose _pathes are in the great Waters, and whose footsteps are not known: O novum atque inauditum ad principatum iter_, who that shall write Annals, or Verses can ever forget that day? not decrepit age, not the sick, not the tender Sex were kept back from resolving to behold that miraculous entry of yours; The very little children pointed to you, the striplings and young men exsulted, the Antient men stood amazed, and those who were under the empire of a cruel disease, leaped out of their beds, to have the sight of you, that were the safety of the People, returning with cure and refreshment: Others protested, they had even now lived long enough, and were ready to expire with joy, and the transports of their spirits; as satisfied that this Ball could not present them with an other object worthy their admiration; others wished now to live more then ever, that they might still enjoy their desired object; and women forgetting the pains of childbirth, brought forth with joy, because they gave Citizens to their Prince, and Souldiers now to their lawful Emperour.  Your Majesty must needs remember, nor is the sound yet out of your sacred ears, when the houses of this your August Metropolis were covered with the loud and cheerful spectators, because the earth was too narrow to contain them; the wayes and the trees were filled with the shouting of your people, LONG LIVE KING _CHARLES_ THE _II._ _tamque æqualiter ab omnibus ex adventu tuo lætitia percepta est, quam omnibus venisti_. For when the wise Arbiter of things began to look down upon us, all things conspir'd to make us happy; our Deliverance by your Majesty as by another _Moses_, leading us out of that _Ægyptian_ bondage; or by a nearer resemblance that of the _Babylonish_ captivity, if not yet farr greater; since God did there only turne the heart of a Prince to let a nation go: Here, the hearts of a whole Nation, to invite a banish'd Prince to come, when no other visible power interpos'd. Let others boast then of their miracles; we can produce such, as no age, no people under heaven can shew; God moving the hearts of his most implacable Enemies in a moment as it were, and those who had been before inhumanely thirsty after your blood, now ready to sacrifice their own for your safety; _Digna res memoratu! ibat sub ducibus vexillisque Regiis, hostis aliquando Regius, & signa contra quæ steterat sequebatur_. But I suffer [HW: surfeit] with too much Plenty, and what eloquence is able to expresse the triumph of that your never to be forgotten Entry, unlesse it be the renewing of it this day? For then were we as those who dream, and can yet hardly be perswaded, that we are truly awake: _Dies ille æternis seculis monumentisque mandandus_, A day never to be forgotten in all our Generations, but to be consecrated to posterity, transmitted to future Ages, and inserted into Monuments more lasting then Brasse. Away then with these Woodden and temporary Arches, to be taken down by the People at pleasure; erect Marble ones, lasting as the Pyramids, and immovable as the mountains themselves, and when they fail, let the memory of it still remain engraven in our Hearts, Books, Records, _novissimo haud peritura die_.  And yet not this altogether, because we have received a Prince, but such a Prince, whose state and fortune in all this blessed change, we so much admire not, as his mind; For that is truly felicity, not to possesse great things, but to be thought worthy of them: And indeed Great Sir, necessity constrains me, and the laws of _Panegyric_, to verifie it in your Praises, by running over at least those other Appellations, which both your vertue has given to your Majesty, and your Fortune acquir'd. For he is really no King who possesses not (like you) a Kingly mind, be his other advantages what they may: If the Republick belong then to _Cæsar_, _Cæsar_ belongs much more to the Republick; and of this you have given proof.  For no sooner were we possess'd of your sacred Majestie, but you suddainly gave form to our confused _Chaos_: We presently saw when you had taken the reigns into your sacred hands, and began to sit at Sterne, our deviating and giddy course grow steady, and the fluctuating Republick at drift ready to put into a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17833"],["title","An Apologie for the Royal Party (1659); and A Panegyric to Charles the Second (#7)"],["body","Port.  You began your Entry with an act of general Clemency, and to make good the advice of your Martyr'd Father, and the best Religion, forgave you bitterest Enemies; and not only barely forgiving, but by an excesse of charity, doing honour to some, _ut nemo sibi victus te victore videatur_. This was plainly Godlike: For so rare a thing we find it, that Princes think themselves oblig'd; or if they think it, that they love it; that your example will reproach all who went before you: As you promis'd, so you perform'd it, punctually, and with advantage. Nor indeed do you desire any thing should be permitted your Majesty, but what is indulg'd your Vassals, subjecting even your self to those Lawes by which you oblige your Subjects; For as it is a great felicity to be able to do what one will, so is it much more glorious, to will only what is just and honourable. All other Princes before your Majesty spake as much; you only have performed it; nor is there a Tittle of your engagements, which even your very enemies diffide of, much lesse your Friends suspect: They enjoy, and these hope; because those were to be conciliated by present effects, these are secure by past promises; and none that receives them of your Majesty reckons from the time they injoy it, but the period of your promise; because it proceeds (they know) from a Princely and candid mind; and if it seem long in acquiring, it is not (I perswade my self) because you are difficult, much less unmindful; but that the benefit may be more acceptable, and the sense of it more permanent; since too suddain felicity astonishes, and sometimes renders the Recipient ingrateful, whilst your favours are not fugitive but certain. It was only for Your Majestie to be compleatly happie, when you began to be so; and yet your subjects had as much as they could well support; since you have made it your only businesse to sublevate the needie, and give them as it were a new Fate, your piety not more appearing in pardoning your Enemies, and receiving the Penitent, then your justice in restoring the Oppressed: For how many are since your returne, return'd to their own Homes, to their Wives, Children, Offices, and Patrimonies? _Addiditque Dominus omnia quæ fuerant Jobi duplicia_; some of them with immense advantages; and of this the languishing _Church of England_ is a most eminent instance; That she, which was first and most afflicted, should be first and chiefly refreshed.  You have taken away the affluence to the Committees, Sequestrators, Conventicles, and unjust Slaughter-houses, and converted their zeal to the Temples, the Courts, and the just Tribunals: Magnanimity is return'd again to the Nobility, Modesty to the People, Obedience to Subjects, Charity to Neighbours, Pietie to Children, Fidelity to Servants, and Reverence to Religion; In summe, You are the Restorer of Your Countrie.  The lawes that were lately quiescent, and even trampled under foot, your Majesty has revived; and been yet so prudent in reforming, that even those which your Enemies made upon good deliberation, you permit to stand, shewing your self rather to have been displeased with the Authours, then the Things.  As to Discipline (after the sacrifice due for that innocent blood of your glorious Father) you are not only careful to reject vice your self; but are severe to discountenance it in others; and that yet so sweetly, as you seem rather to perswade then compell; and to cure without a corrosive.  The Army is disbanded, and the Navy paid off without Tumult; because you are trusted without suspicion, and are more secure in the publick love and affection of your people then in men of Iron, the locks and Bars of Tyrants Palaces: And truely Sir, there is no protection to innocency, which is a fort inexpugnable: In vain therefore do Princes confide in any other; for Armes invite Armes, Terrour, suspition. To this only do you trust, and the few which you maintain about your person, is rather for state, then fear. _Quid enim istis opus est, quum firmissimo sis muro Civici amoris obtectus?_ Here is then the firm Keeper of our Liberties indeed, whom the Armies love for His own sake, and whom no servile flattery adores; but a simple, and sincere devotion; and verily such a Prince as Your Majesty, deserves to have friends, Prompt, steady and faithful; such as You have, and which Virtue rather then Fortune procures. Of this I obtest the fidelity of Your own inviolable Party, distinguished formerly by the invidious name of _Cavalier_, though significant and glorious; but I provoke the World to produce me an example of parallel Loyaltie: What Prince under heaven, after so many losses, and all imaginable calamities, can boast of such a party? The _Grecians_ forsook their Leaders upon every sleight disaster; the very _Romans_ were not steady of old, but followed the fortune of the Common Victor. The _German_ and the _French_ will happily stick to their Prince in distresse, as far as the Plate, the Tapistry, or some such superfluous moveable may abide the pawn; But where shall we find a Subject that hath persisted like Your Majesties, to the losse of Libertie, Estate, and life it self, when yet all seem'd to be determin'd against them; so as even their enemies were at last vanquish'd with their constancy, and their very Tormentors wearied with their insuperable Patience; nor can they in all that tract of Time, hardly brag of having made one signal _Proselyte_ in twenty Years that this difference continu'd; and that because the obedience of your Majesties Subjects, is engraffed into their Religion and Institution, as well as into the adoration of Your Virtues.  I would not therefore that Your Name should be painted upon Banners, or Carved in stone, _sed Monumentis æternæ laudis_; and Your Majesty did well foresee, and consult it, when you furnish'd a Subject for our _Panegyrics_, and our Histories, which should outlast those frail materials. The Statues of _Cæsar_, _Brutus_ and _Camillus_ were set up indeed because they chased their enemies from the Walls of a proud Citie; You have done it from a whole Kingdom; not (as they) by blood and slaughter, but by your prudence and Counsels: Nor is it lightly to be passed over, that your Majesty was preserved in that _Royal Oak_, to whom a Civical Crown should so justly become due.  But I now arrive to the _Lawes_ you have made, and the excellent things which your Majestie hath done since you came amongst Your people. Truely, there is hardly an hour to be reckoned wherein your Majesty has not done some signal benefit. I have already touch'd a few of them, as what concern'd the most, I would I could say the best; for you have oblig'd your very Enemies, You have bought them; since never was there, till now, so prodigious a summe paid, a summe hardly in Nature, to verifie a Word only; and which the zeal of Your good Subjects (had you taken the advantage of the fervour which I but now mentioned, at Your wonderful Reception) might easily have absolv'd You of; had You paid them in kind, and as they were wont to keep faith with your Majestie. I provoke the World again to furnish an instance of a like generositie, unlesse he climb up to heaven for it. How black then must that ingratitude needs appear, which should after all this, dare to rebell; Or, for the future once murmur at Your Government? Since it was no necessity that compell'd You, but an excesse of your good nature, and your charitie.  Your Majestie has abolished the _Court of Wards_; I cannot say we have freed ourselves in desiring it, if it were possible to hope for so indulgent a Father as Your Majestie is to Your Countrie, in those who shall succeed You.  The _Compositions_ You have likewise eased us of, if that could be esteem'd a burthen, to serve so excellent a Prince, who receives nothing of his Subjects but what he returnes again in the Noblest and worthiest Hospitality, that any Potentate in earth can produce; Thus what the Rivers pay to the Ocean, it returns again in showers to replenish them. But Your Majestie would dissipate even the very shadows, which give us umbrage; and rather part with your own just right, then those few of your Subjects which it concern'd, should think themselves aggreiv'd, though by a mistake even of their duty.  [SN: _His Majesties Declaration._] But I should first have mention'd your settlement of the _Church_, and Your bringing back the Ark of God: Your Majesties wise composure of our Frailties, and tendernesse as well in the Religious as the Secular; whilst yet You continue fervent to maintain what is decent, and what is setled by Law. But what language is capable to expresse this Article? Let those who wait at the Altar, and to which you have restor'd the daily sacrifice, supply the defect of this period, and celebrate your piety.  Nor has yet Your zeal to the Church, lessen'd that which is due to the Common-wealth; witnesse your industry in erecting a _Counsel of Trade_, by which alone you have sufficiently verified that expression of your Majesties in your Declaration from _Breda_, That You would propose some useful things for the publick emolument of the Nation, which should render it opulent, splendid and flourishing; making good your pretence to the universall Soveraignty by Your Princely care, as well as by your birth and undoubted Title.  You have Restor'd, Adorn'd, and Repair'd our Courts of Judicature, turning the Shambles where your Subjects were lately butcher'd, into a Tribunal, where they may now expect due Justice; and have furnish'd the Supreame seat there with a _Chancelour_ of antient candor, rare experience; just, prudent, learned and faithfull; in summe, one, whose merits beget universal esteem, and is amongst the greatest indications of your Majesties skill in persons, as well as in their Talents and perfections to serve you. Thus you have gratified the long robe, so as now again,             _Te propter colimus leges, animosque ferarum     Exuimus_----And"]]]
