The Hessian soldier andirons, the portrait over the Boynton mantel, and even Letty Boynton's cape were identified on the first card, sooner or later, but it was obvious that Mrs. Larrabee had to have a picture for her verses and couldn't be supposed to make one up \"out of her head\"; though Osh Popham declared it had been done again and again in other parts of the world. Also it was agreed that, as Letty's face was not distinguishable, nobody outside of Beulah could recognize her by her cape; and that anyhow it couldn't make much difference, for if anybody wanted to spend fifteen cents on a card he would certainly buy the one about \"the folks back home.\" The popularity of this was established by the fact that it was selling, not only in Beulah and Greentown, but in Boston, and in Racine, Wisconsin, and, it was rumored, even in Chicago. The village milliner in Beulah had disposed of twenty-seven copies in thirteen days and the minister's wife was universally conceded to be the most celebrated person in the State of New Hampshire.  Letty Boynton had an uncomfortable moment when she saw the first card, but common sense assured her that outside of a handful of neighbors no one would identify her home surroundings; meantime she was proud of Reba's financial and artistic triumph in \"The Folks Back Home\" and generously glad that she had no share in it.  Twice during the autumn David had broken his silence, but only to send her a postal from some Western town, telling her that he should have no regular address for a time; that he was traveling for a publishing firm and felt ill-adapted to the business. He hoped that she and the children were well, for he himself was not; etc., etc.  The twins had been photographed by Osh Popham, who was Jack of all trades and master of many, and a sight of their dimpled charms, curly heads, and straight little bodies would have gladdened any father's heart, Letty thought. However, she scorned to win David back by any such specious means. If he didn't care to know whether his children were hump-backed, bow-legged, cross-eyed, club-footed, or feeble-minded, why should she enlighten him? This was her usual frame of mind, but in these last days of the year how she longed to pop the bewitching photographs and Reba's Christmas cards into an envelope and send them to David.  But where? No word at all for weeks and weeks, and then only a postal from St. Joseph, saying that he had given up his position on account of poor health. Nothing in all this to keep Christmas on, thought Letty, and she knitted and crocheted and sewed with extra ardor that the twins' stockings might be filled with bright things of her own making.     [Illustration]  VI   On the afternoon before Christmas of that year, the North Station in Boston was filled with hurrying throngs on the way home for the holidays. Everybody looked tired and excited, but most of them had happy faces, and men and women alike had as many bundles as they could carry; bundles and boxes quite unlike the brown paper ones with which commuters are laden on ordinary days. These were white packages, beribboned and beflowered and behollied and bemistletoed, to be gently carried and protected from crushing.  The train was filled to overflowing and many stood in the aisles until Latham Junction was reached and the overflow alighted to change cars for Greentown and way stations.  Among the crowd were two men with suit-cases who hurried into the way train and, entering the smoking car from opposite ends, met in the middle of the aisle, dropped their encumbrances, stretched out a hand and ejaculated in the same breath:  \"Dick Larrabee, upon my word!\"  \"Dave Gilman, by all that's great!--Here, let's turn over a seat for our baggage and sit together. Going home, I s'pose?\"  The men had not met for some years, but each knew something of the other's circumstances and hoped that the other didn't know too much. They scanned each other's faces, Dick thinking that David looked pinched and pale, David half-heartedly registering the quick impression that Dick was prosperous.  \"Yes,\" David answered; \"I'm going home for a couple of days. It's such a confounded journey to that one-horse village that a business man can't get there but once in a generation!\"  \"Awful hole!\" confirmed Dick. \"Simply awful hole! I didn't get it out of my system for years.\"  \"Married?\" asked David.  \"No; rather think I'm not the marrying kind, though the fact is I've had no time for love affairs--too busy. Let's see, you have a child, haven't you?\"  \"Yes; Letty has seen to all that business for me since my wife died.\" (Wild horses couldn't have dragged the information from him that the \"child\" was \"twins,\" and Dick didn't need it anyway, for he had heard the news the morning he left Beulah.) \"Wonder if there have been many changes in the village?\"  \"Don't know; there never used to be! Mrs. Popham has been ailing for years,--she couldn't die; and Deacon Todd wouldn't!\" Dick's old animosities still lingered faintly in his memory, though his laughing voice and the twinkle in his eyes showed plainly that no bitterness was left. \"How's business with you, David?\"  \"Only so-so. I've had the devil's own luck lately. Can't get anything that suits me or that pays a decent income. I formed a new connection the other day, but I can't say yet what there is in it. I'm just out of hospital; operation; they cut out the wrong thing first, I believe, sewed me up absent-mindedly, then remembered it was the other thing, and did it over again. At any rate, that's the only way I can account for their mewing me up there for two months.\"  \"Well, well, that is hard luck! I'm sorry, old boy! Things didn't begin to go my way either till within the last few months. I've always made a fair living and saved a little money, but never gained any real headway. Now I've got a first-rate start and the future looks pretty favorable, and best of all, pretty safe.--No trouble at home calls you back to Beulah? I hope Letty is all right?\" Dick cast an anxious side glance at David, though he spoke carelessly.  \"Oh, no! Everything's serene, so far as I know. I'm a poor correspondent, especially when I've no good news to tell; and anyway, the mere sight of a pen ties my tongue. I'm just running down to surprise Letty.\"  Dick looked at David again. He began to think he didn't like him. He used to, when they were boys, but when he brought that unaccountable wife home and foisted her and her babies on Letty, he rather turned against him. David was younger than himself, four or five years younger, but he looked as if he hadn't grown up. Surely his boyhood chum hadn't used to be so pale and thin-chested or his mouth so ladylike and pretty. A good face, though; straight and clean, with honest eyes and a likable smile. Lack of will, perhaps, or a persistent run of ill luck. Letty had always kept him stiffened up in the old days. Dick recalled one of his father's phrases to the effect that Dave Gilman would spin on a very small biscuit, and wondered if it were still true.  \"And you, Dick? Your father's still living? You see I haven't kept up with Beulah lately.\"  \"Keeping up with Beulah! It sounds like the title of a novel, but the hero would have to be a snail or he'd pass Beulah in the first chapter!--Yes, father's hale and hearty, I believe.\"  \"You come home every Christmas, I s'pose?\" inquired David.  \"No; as a matter of fact this is my first visit since I left for good.\"  \"That's about my case.\" And David, hung his head a little, unconsciously.  \"That so? Well, I was a hot-headed fool when I said good-bye to Beulah, and it's taken me all this time to cool off and make up my mind to apologize to the dad. There's--there's rather a queer coincidence about my visit just at this time.\"  \"Speaking of coincidences,\" said David, \"I can beat yours, whatever it is. If the thought of your father brought you back, my mother drew me--this way!\" And he took something from his inside coat pocket.--\"Do you see that?\"  Dick regarded the object blankly, then with a quick gesture dived into his pocket and brought forth another of the same general character. \"How about this?\" he asked.  Each had one of Reba Larrabee's Christmas cards but David had the first unsuccessful one and Dick the popular one with the lonely little gray house and the verse about the folks back home.  The men looked at each other in astonishment and Dick gave a low whistle. Then they bent over the cards together.  \"It was mother's picture that pulled me back to Beulah, I don't mind telling you,\" said David, his mouth twitching. \"Don't you see it?\"  \"Oh! Is that your mother?\" And Dick scanned the card closely.  \"Don't you remember her portrait that always hung there after she died?\"  \"Yes, of course!\" And Dick's tone was apologetic. \"You see the face is so small I didn't notice it, but I recognize it now and remember the portrait.\"  \"Then the old sitting-room!\" exclaimed David. \"Look at the rag carpet and the blessed old andirons! Gracious! I've crawled round those Hessian soldiers, burned my fingers and cracked my skull on 'em, often enough when I was a kid! When I'd studied the card five minutes, I bought a ticket and started for home.\"  David's eyes were suffused and his lip trembled.  \"I don't wonder,\" said Dick. \"I recognize the dear old room right enough, and of course I should know Letty.\"  \"It didn't occur to me that it _was_ Letty for some time,\" said her brother. \"There's just the glimpse of a face shown, and no real likeness.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" agreed Dick. \"A stranger wouldn't have known it for Letty, but if it had been only that cape I should have guessed. It's as familiar as Mrs. Popham's bugle bonnet, and much prettier. She wore it every winter, skating, you know,--and it's just the color of her hair.\"  \"Letty has a good-shaped head,\" said David judicially. \"It"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17456"],["title","The Romance of a Christmas Card (#6)"],["body","s, even in the card.\"  \"And a remarkable ear,\" added Dick, \"so small and so close to her head.\"  \"I never notice people's ears,\" confessed David.  \"Don't you? I do, and eyelashes, too. Mother's got Letty's eyelashes down fine.--She's changed, Dave, Letty has! That hurts me. She was always so gay and chirpy. In this picture she has a sad, far-away, listening look, but mother may have put that in just to make it interesting.\"  \"Or perhaps I've had something to do with the change of expression!\" thought David. \"What attracted me first,\" he added, \"was your mother's verses. She always had a knack of being pious without cramming piety down your throat. I liked that open door. It meant welcome, no matter how little you'd deserved it.\"  \"Where'd you get your card, Dave?\" asked Dick. \"It's prettier than mine.\"  \"A nurse brought it to me in the hospital just because she took a fancy to it. She didn't know it would mean anything to me, but it did--a relapse!\" And David laughed shamedfacedly. \"I guess she'll confine herself to beef tea after this!--Where'd you get yours?\"  \"Picked it up on a dentist's mantelpiece when I was waiting for an appointment. I was traveling round the room, hands in my pockets, when suddenly I saw this card standing up against an hour-glass. The color caught me. I took it to the window, and at first I was puzzled. It certainly was Letty's house. The door's open you see and there's somebody in the window. I knew it was Letty, but how could any card publisher have found the way to Beulah? Then I discovered mother's initials snarled up in holly, and remembered that she was always painting and illuminating.\"  \"Queer job, life is!\" said David, putting his card back in his pocket and wishing there were a little more time, or that he had a little more courage, so that he might confide in Dick Larrabee. He felt a desire to tell him some of the wretchedness he had lived through. It would be a comfort just to hint that his unhappiness had made him a coward, so that the very responsibilities that serve as a spur to some men had left him until now cold, unstirred, unvitalized.  \"You're right!\" Dick answered. \"Life is a queer job and it doesn't do to shirk it. And just as queer as anything in life is the way that mother's Christmas cards brought us back to Beulah! They acted as a sort of magic, didn't they?--Jiminy! I believe the next station is Beulah. I hope the depot team will be hitched up.\"  \"Yes, here we are; seven o'clock and the train only thirty-five minutes late. It always made a point of that on holidays!\"  \"Never mind!\" And Dick's tone was as gay as David's was sober. \"The bean-pot will have gone back to the cellarway and the doughnuts to the crock, but the 'folks back home' 'll get 'em out for us, and a mince pie, too, and a cut of sage cheese.\"  \"There won't be any 'folks back home,' we're so late, I'm thinking. There's always a Christmas Eve festival at the church, you know. They never change--in Beulah.\"  \"Then, by George, they can have me for Santa Claus!\" said Dick as they stepped out on the platform. \"Why, it doesn't seem cold at all; yet look at the ice on the river! What skating, and what a moon! My blood's up, and if I find the parsonage closed, I'll follow on to the church and make my peace with the members. There's a kind of spell on me! For the first time in years I feel as though I could shake hands with Deacon Todd.\"  \"Well, Merry Christmas to you, Dick,--I'm going to walk. Good gracious! Have you come to spend the winter?\" For various bags and parcels were being flung out on the platform with that indifference and irresponsibility that bespeak the touch of the seasoned baggage-handler.  \"You didn't suppose I was coming back to Beulah empty-handed, on Christmas Eve, did you? If I'm in time for the tree, I'm going to give those blue-nosed, frost-bitten little youngsters something to remember! Jump in, Dave, and ride as far as the turn of the road.\"  In a few minutes the tottering old sign-board that marked the way to Beulah Center hove in sight, and David jumped from the sleigh to take his homeward path.  \"Merry Christmas again, Dick!\" he waved.  \"Same to you, Dave! I'll come myself to say it to Letty the first minute I see smoke coming from your chimney to-morrow morning. Tell her you met me, will you, and that my visit is partly for her, only that father had to have his turn first. She'll know why. Tell her mother's card had Christmas magic in it, tell--\"  \"Say, tell her the rest yourself, will you, Dick?\" And Dave broke into a run down the hill road that led to Letty.  \"I will, indeed!\" breathed Dick into his muffler.     [Illustration]  VII   Repeating history, Letty was again at her open window. She had been half-ashamed to reproduce the card, as it were, but something impelled her. She was safe from scrutiny, too, for everybody had gone to the tree--the Pophams, Mr. Davis, Clarissa Perry, everybody for a quarter of a mile up and down the street, and by now the company would be gathered and the tree lighted. She could keep watch alone, the only sound being that of the children's soft breathing in the next room.  Letty had longed to go to the festival herself, but old Clarissa Perry, who cared for the twins now and then in Letty's few absences, had a niece who was going to \"speak a piece,\" and she yearned to be present and share in the glory; so Letty was kept at home as she had been numberless other times during the three years of her vicarious motherhood.  The night was mild again, as in the year before. The snow lay like white powder on the hard earth; the moon was full, and the street was a length of dazzling silence. The lighted candle was in the parlor window, shining toward the meeting-house, the fire burned brightly on the hearth, the front door was ajar. Letty wrapped her old cape round her shoulders, drew her hood over her head, and seating herself at the window repeated under her breath:--      \"My door is on the latch to-night,       The hearth-fire is aglow.     I seem to hear swift passing feet,       The Christ Child in the snow.      \"My heart is open wide to-night       For stranger, kith, or kin;     I would not bar a single door       Where Love might enter in!\"  And then a footstep, drawing ever nearer, sounded crunch, crunch, in the snow. Letty pushed her chair back into the shadow. The footstep halted at the gate, came falteringly up the path, turned aside, and came nearer the window. Then a voice said: \"Don't be frightened Letty, it's David! Can I come in? I haven't any right to, except that it's Christmas Eve.\"  That, indeed, was the magic, the all-comprehending phrase that swept the past out of mind with one swift stroke: the acknowledgment of unworthiness, the child-like claim on the forgiving love that should be in every heart on such a night as this. Resentment melted away like mist before the sun. Her deep grievance--where had it gone? How could she speak anything but welcome? For what was the window open, the fire lighted, the door ajar, the guiding candle-flame, but that Love, and David, might enter in?  There were few words at first; nothing but close-locked hands and wet cheeks pressed together. Then Letty sent David into the children's room by himself. If the twins were bewitching when awake, they were nothing short of angelic when asleep.  [Illustration: \"I NEVER THOUGHT OF THEM AS MY CHILDREN BEFORE\"]  David came out a little later, his eyes reddened with tears, his hair rumpled, his face flushed. He seemed like a man awed by an entirely new experience. He could not speak, he could only stammer brokenly:--  \"As God is my witness, Letty, there's been something wrong with me up to this moment. I never thought of them as my children before, and I can't believe that such as they can belong to me. They were never wanted, and I've never had any interest in them. I owe them to you, Letty; you've made them what they are; you, and no one else.\"  \"If there hadn't been something there to build on, my love and care wouldn't have counted for much. They're just like dear mother's people for good looks and brains and pretty manners: they're pure Shirley all the way through, the twinnies are.\"  \"It's lucky for me that they are!\" said David humbly. \"You see, Letty, I married Eva to keep my promise. If I was old enough to make it, I was old enough to keep it, so I thought. She never loved me, and when she found out that I didn't love her any longer she turned against me. Our life together was awful, from beginning to end, but she's in her grave, and nobody'll ever hear my side, now that she can't tell hers. When I looked at those two babies the day I left you, I thought of them only as retribution; and the vision of them--ugly, wrinkled, writhing little creatures--has been in my mind ever since.\"  \"They were compensation, not retribution, David. I ought to have told you how clever and beautiful they were, but you never asked and my pride was up in arms. A man should stand by his own flesh and blood, even if it isn't attractive; that's what I believe.\"  \"I know, I know! But I've had no feeling for three years. I've been like a frozen man, just drifting, trying to make both ends meet, my heart dead and my body full of pain. I'm just out of a hospital--two months in all.\"  \"David! Why didn't you let me know, or send for me?\"  \"Oh, it was way out in Missouri. I was taken ill very suddenly at the hotel in St. Joseph and they moved me at once. There were two operations first and last, and I didn't know enough to feed myself most of the time.\"  \"Poor, poor Buddy! Did you have good care?\"  \"The best. I had more than care. Ruth Bentley, the nurse that brought me back to life, made me see what a useless creature I was.\"  Some woman's instinct stirred in Letty at a new note in her brother's voice and a new look in his face. She braced herself for his next words, sure that they would open a fresh chapter. The door and the window were closed now, the shades pulled down,"]]]
