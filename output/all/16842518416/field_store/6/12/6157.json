Then silence and utter stillness only, and the cold, calm moon staring down over all.  Gulo picked himself up after a bit, and slouched round the tree to investigate.  He found tracks there, and blood; and the tracks were the biggest footprints of a bear--a brown bear--that he had ever come across, and I suppose that he must have sniffed at a few in his time.  Presumably the man had fired at the bear when the startled horse shied. Presumably, too, the bear was hit.  He had gone straight away in the track of horse and man, anyway, and--he had saved the wolverine's life, after, with paw and teeth, doing his best to end it.  Possibly he had been disturbed in the process of making his winter home.  Gulo lay low, or hunted very furtively, after that for some time, until it was little less dark in the east than it had been, and the gaunt tree-trunks were standing out a fraction from the general gloom.  The moon had apparently nearly burnt itself out.  Still, it yet appeared to be night.  Gulo was a long way out of his own hunting-district, and guessed that it was about time for him to get himself out of sight.  He had a passionate hatred of the day, by the way, even beyond most night hunters.  On the way he smelt out and dug up a grouse beneath the snow.  Dawn found him, or, rather, failed to find him, hidden under a tangled mass that was part windfall, part brush-wood, and part snow.  The place had belonged to a fox the night before, and that red worthy returned soon after dawn.  He thrust an inquiring sharp muzzle inside, took one sniff, and, with every hair alift, retired in haste, without waiting to hear the villainous growl that followed him.  The smell was enough for him--a most calamitous stink.  It snowed all that day, and things grew quieter and quieter, except in the tree-tops, where the wind spoke viciously between its teeth.  When Gulo came out that evening, he had to dig part of the way, and he viewed a still and silent, white world, under a sky like the lid of a lead box, very low down.  He stood higher against the tree-trunks than he had done the night before, and, though he did not know it, was safe from any horse, for the snow was quite deep.  The cold was awful, but it did not seem to trouble him, as he slouched slowly southward.  There appeared to be nothing alive at all throughout this white land, but you must never trust to that in the wild.  Things there are very rarely what they seem.  For instance, Gulo came into a clearing, dim under the night sky, though it would never be dark that night.  To the ear and the eye that clearing was as empty as a swept room.  To Gulo's nose it was not, and he was just about to crouch and execute a stalk, when half the snow seemed to get up and run away.  The runners were wood-hares.  They had \"frozen\" stiff on the alarm from their sentries. But it was not Gulo who had caused them to depart.  Him, behind a tree, they had not spotted.  Something remained--something that moved.  And Gulo saw it when it moved--not before.  It was an ermine, a stoat in winter dress, white as driven snow.  Then it caught sight of Gulo, or, more likely, the gleam of his eyes, and departed also.  Gulo slouched on, head down, back humped, tail low, a most dejected-looking, out-at-heels tramp of the wilderness.  Once he came upon a wild cat laying scientific siege to a party of grouse.  The grouse were nowhere to be seen; nor was the wild cat, after Gulo announced his intention to break his neutrality.  Gulo knew where the grouse were.  He dug down into the snow, and came upon a tunnel.  He dug farther, and came upon other tunnels, round and clean, in the snow.  All the tunnels smelt of grouse, but devil a grouse could he find.  He had come a bit early.  It was as yet barely night, and he should have waited till later, when they would be more asleep. However, he dug on along the tunnels, driving the grouse before him. And then a strange thing happened.  About three yards ahead of him the snow burst--burst, I say, like a six-inch shell, upwards.  There was a terrific commotion, a wild, whirring, whirling smother, a cloud of white, and away went five birds, upon heavily beating wings, into the gathering gloom.  Gulo went away, too, growling deep down inside of, and to, himself.  He was hungry, was Gulo.  Indeed, there did not seem to be many times when he was not hungry.  Also, being angry--not even a wild animal likes failure--he was seeking a sacrifice; but he had crossed the plain, which the night before had been as a nightmare desert to him, and the moon was up before his chance came.  He crossed the trail of the reindeer.  He did not know anything about those reindeer, mark you, whether they were wild or semi-tame; and _I_ do not know, though _he_ may have done, how old the trail was.  It was sufficient for him that they _were_ reindeer, and that they had traveled in the general direction that he wanted to go.  For the rest--he had the patience, perhaps more than the patience, of a cat, the determination of a bulldog, and the nose of a bloodhound.  He trailed those reindeer the better part of that night, and most of the time it snowed, and part of the time it snowed hard.  By the time a pale, frozen dawn crept weakly over the forest tree-tops Gulo must have been well up on the trail of that herd, and he had certainly traveled an astonishing way.  He had dug up one lemming--a sort of square-ended relation of the rat, with an abbreviated tail--and pounced upon one pigmy owl, scarce as large as a thrush, which he did not seem to relish much--perhaps owl is an acquired taste--before he turned a wild cat out of its lair--to the accompaniment of a whole young riot of spitting and swearing--and curled up for the day.  He was hungry when he went to sleep.  Also, it was snowing then.  When he woke up it was almost dark, and snowing worse than ever.  If it could have been colder, it was.  While he cleaned himself Gulo took stock of the outside prospect, so far as the white curtain allowed to sight, and by scent a good deal that it did not.  This without appearing outside the den, you understand.  And if there had been any enemy in hiding, waiting for him outside, he would have discovered the fact then.  He had many enemies, and no friends, had Gulo.  All that he received from all whom he met was hate, but he gave back more than he got.  In the lucid terms of the vernacular, he \"was a hard un, if you like.\"  Nothing and nobody saw the wolverine leave that lair that was not his. He must have chosen one blinding squall of snow for the purpose, and was half a mile away, still on the track of the reindeer, before he showed himself--shuffling along as usual, a ragged, hard-bitten ruffian.  And three hours later he came up with his prey.  Gulo knew it, but nobody else could have done.  There were just the straight trees ahead, and all around the eternal white, frozen silence, and the snow falling softly over everything; but Gulo was as certain that there was the herd close ahead as he was that he was ravenous. And thereafter Gulo got to work, the peculiar work, a special devilish genius for which appears to be given to the wolverine.  He ceased to exist.  At least, nothing of him was seen, not a tail, not an eye-gleam.  Yet during the next two hours he learnt everything, private and public, there was to be learnt.  Also, he had been over the surroundings almost to a yard.  Nothing could have escaped him.  No detail of risk and danger, of the chance of being seen even, had been overlooked; for he was a master at his craft, the greatest master in the wild, perhaps.  The wolf?  My dear sirs, the wolf was an innocent suckling cub beside Gulo, look you, and his brain and his cunning were not the brain and the cunning of a beast at all, but of a devil.  When, after a very long time, he reappeared upon his original track, it was as a dark blotch, indistinguishable from a dozen other dark blots of moon-shadow, creeping forward belly-flat in the snow.  This belly-creep, hugging always every available inch of cover, he kept up till he came to a big clearing, and--there were the reindeer.  At least, there was one reindeer, a doe, standing with her back towards him--a quite young doe.  The rest were half-hidden in the snow, which they had trampled into a maze of paths in and out about the clearing, which was, in fact, what is called their \"yard.\"  A minute of tense silence followed after Gulo had got as close as he could without being seen.  Then he rushed.  The reindeer swung half-round, gave one snort, and a great bound.  But Gulo had covered half the intervening space before she knew, and when she bounded it was with him hanging on to her.  Followed instantly a wild upspringing of snorting beasts, and a mad, senseless stampede of floundering deer all round and about the clearing--a fearful mix-up, somewhere in the midst of which, half-hidden by flying, finely powdered snow, Gulo did his prey horribly to death.  There was something ghastly about this murder, for the deer was so big, and Gulo comparatively small.  The fearful work of his jaws and his immense strength seemed wrong somehow, and out of all proportion to his size.  This remarkable power of his jaws had that sinister disproportion only paralleled by the power of the jaws of a hyena; indeed, his teeth very much resembled a hyena's teeth.  With the deer rushing all around him, Gulo fed, ravenously and horribly, but not for long.  A new light smoldered in his eyes now as he lifted his carmine snout, and one saw that, for the moment, the beast was mad, crazed with the lust of killing, seeing red, and blinded by blood.  Then the massacre began.  It was not a hunt, because each deer, thinking only of itself, feared to break from the trodden mazy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],["title","The Way of the Wild (#3)"],["body"," of the \"yard,\" and risk the slow, helpless, plunging progress necessary in the deep snow.  Wherefore panic took them all over again, and they dashed, often colliding, generally hindering each other, hither and thither, up and down the paths of the \"yard\" with the hopeless, helpless, senseless, blind abandon of sheep.  The result was a shambles.  This part we skip.  Probably--nay, certainly--Nature knows best, and is quite well aware what she is up to, and it is perhaps not meant that we should put her in the limelight in her grisly moods.  Suffice it to say that Gulo seemed to stop at length, simply because even he could not \"see red\" forever, and with exhaustion returned sense, and with sense--in his case--in-born caution.  He removed, leaving a certain number of reindeer bleeding upon the ground.  Some of them were dead.  In an hour dawn would be conspiring to show him up before the world, and he was not a beast sweet to look upon at that moment--indeed, at any moment, but less so now.  Now, it is surprising how far a wolverine can shift his clumsy-looking body over snow in an hour, especially if he has reasons.  This one had good reasons, and he was no fool.  He knew quite well the kind of little hell he had made for himself behind there, and he did not stay to let the snow cover him.  He traveled as if he were a machine and knew no fatigue; and the end of that journey was a hole in a hollow among rocks.  Dawn was throwing a wan light upon all things when he thrust his short, sharp muzzle inside that hole, to be met by a positively hair-raising volley of rasping, vicious growls.  He promptly ripped out a string of ferocious, dry, harsh growls in return, and for half-a-minute the air became full of growls, horrible and blood-curdling, each answering each.  Then he lurched in over the threshold, and coolly dodged a thick paw, with tearing white claws, that whipped at him with a round-arm stroke out of the pitch-darkness.  The stroke was repeated, scraping, but in nowise hurting his matted coat, as he rose on his hindlegs and threw himself upon the striker.  Followed a hectic thirty seconds of simply diabolical noises, while the two rolled upon the ground, grappling fiendishly in the darkness.  Then they parted, got up, growled one final roll of fury at each other, fang to fang, and, curling up, went to sleep.  But it was nothing, only the quite usual greeting between Gulo and his wife.  They were a sweet couple.  There appeared to be no movement, or any least sign of awakening, on the part of either of the couple between that moment and sometime in the afternoon, when, so far as one could see, Gulo suddenly rolled straight from deep sleep out on to the snow, and away without a sound, at his indescribable shamble and at top speed.  Mrs. Gulo executed precisely the same amazing maneuver, and at exactly the same moment, as far as could be seen, on the other side, and shuffled off into the forest.  They gave no explanation for so doing. They said never a word--nothing.  One moment they were curled up, asleep; the next they had gone, scampered, apparently into the land of the spirits, and were no more.  Nor did there seem to be any reason for this extraordinary conduct except--except----  Well, it is true that a willow-grouse, white as the snowy branch he sat upon, _did_ start clucking somewhere in the dim tree regiments, a snipe did come whistling sadly over the tree-tops, and a raven, jet against the white, did flap up, barking sharply, above the pointed pine-tops; but that was nothing--to us.  To the wolverines it was everything, a whole wireless message in the universal code of the wild, and they had read it _in their sleep_.  Through their slumbers it had spelt into their brains, and instantly snapped into action that wonderful, faultless machinery that moved them to speed as if automatically.  Then the chase began, grim, steady, relentless, dogged--the chase of death, the battle of endurance.  A pause followed after the vanishing of the hated wolverines.  A crow lifted on rounded vans, marking their departure, and it was seen.  A blackcock launched from a high tree with a whir and a bluster like an aeroplane, showing their course, and it was noted.  An eagle climbed heavily and ponderously over the low curtain of the snow mist, pointing their way, and it was followed.  All the wild, all the world, seemed to be against the wolverines.  The brigands were afoot by day.  The scouts were marking their trail.  Then a lynx, moving with great bounds on his huge swathed paws, shot past between the iron-hard tree-boles; a fox followed, scudding like the wind on the frozen crest; a hare, white as a waste wraith, flashed by, swift as a racing white cloud-shadow; a goshawk screamed, and drew a straight streaking line across a glade.  And then came the men, side by side, deadly dumb, with set faces, the pale sun glinting coldly cruel upon the snaky, lean barrels of their slung rifles, moving with steady, fleet, giant strides on their immense spidery ski that were eleven feet long, which whispered ghostily among the silent aisles of Nature's cathedral of a thousand columns.  The Brothers were on the death-trail of Gulo at last; the terrible, dreaded Brothers, who could overtake a full-grown wolf in under thirty minutes on ski, and whose single bullet spelt certain death.  Now for it; now for the fight.  Now for the great test of the \"star\" wild outlaw against the \"star\" human hunters--at last.  The reindeer were to be avenged.  Then Time took the bit of silence between his teeth and seconds became hours, and minutes generations.  No sound made the wolverines as they rolled along in Indian file, except for the soft whisper of the snow underfoot.  No noise encompassed the Brothers as they sped swiftly side by side over the glittering white carpet, save for the slither of the snow under their weight.  All the wild seemed to be standing still, holding its breath, looking on, spell-bound; and save for the occasional crash of a collapsing snow-laden branch, sounding magnified as in a cave, all the forest about there was as still as death.  Half-an-hour passed, and Gulo flung his head around, glancing over his shoulder a little uneasily, but with never a trace of fear in his bloodshot eyes.  Then he grunted, and the two fell apart silently and instantly, gradually getting farther and farther from each other on a diverging course, till his wife faded out among the trees.  But never for an instant did either of them check that tireless, deceptive, clumsy, rolling slouch, that slid the trees behind, as telegraph-poles slide behind the express carriage window.  Half-an-hour passed, and one of the Brothers, peering up and along the trail a little anxiously, saw the forking of the line ahead.  Then he grunted, and the two promptly separated without a word, gradually increasing the distance between them on the widening fork till they were lost to each other among the marshaled trunks.  But never for an instant did they relax that swift, ghostly glide on the wonderful ski, that slid the snow underfoot as a racing motor spins over the ruts.  An hour passed.  Sweat was breaking out in beads upon the faces of the Brothers, now miles apart, but both going in the same general direction over the endless wastes of snow, and upon their faces was beginning to creep the look of that pain that strong men unbeaten feel who see a beating in sight; but never for a moment did they slacken their swift, mysterious glide.  An hour passed.  Foam began to fleck the evilly up-lifted lips glistening back to the glistening fangs of the wolverines, now miles apart, but still heading in the same general line, and upon their faces began to set a look of fiends under torture; but never for a moment did they check their indescribable shuffling slouch.  After that all was a nightmare, blurred and horrible, in which endless processions of trees passed dimly, interspersed with aching blanks of dazzling white that blinded the starting eyes, and man and beast stumbled more than once as they sobbed along, forcing each leg forward by sheer will alone.  At last, on the summit of a hog-backed, bristling ridge, Gulo stopped and looked back, scowling and peering under his low brows.  Beneath him, far away, the valley lay like a white tablecloth, all dotted with green pawns, and the pawns were trees.  But he was not looking for them.  His keen eyes were searching for movement, and he saw it after a bit, a dot that crept, and crept, and crept, and--_stopped_!  Gulo sat up, shading his eyes against the watery sun with his forepaws, watching as perhaps he had never watched in his life before.  For a long, long while, it seemed to him, that dot remained there motionless, far, far away down in the valley, and then at length, slowly, so slowly that at first the movement was not perceptible, it turned about and began to creep away--creep, creep, creep away by the trail it had come.  Gulo watched it till it was out of sight, fading round a bend of the hills into a dark, dotted blur that was woods.  Then he dropped on all fours, and breathed one great, big, long, deep breath.  That dot was the one of the Brothers that had been hunting him.  And almost at the same moment, five miles away, his wife had just succeeded in swimming a swift and ice-choked river.  She was standing on the bank, watching another dot emerge into the lone landscape, and that dot was the other one of the Brothers.  They had failed to avenge the reindeer, and the wolverines were safe. Safe?  Bah!  Wild creatures are never safe.  Nature knows better than that, since by safety comes degeneration.  There was a warning--an instant's rustling hissing in the air above--less than an instant's.  But that was all, and for the first time in his life--perhaps because he was tired, fagged--Gulo failed to take it.  And you must never fail to take a warning if you are a wild creature, you know!  There are no excuses in Nature."]]]
