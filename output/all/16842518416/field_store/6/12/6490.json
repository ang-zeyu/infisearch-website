What would a gentleman do with this?\"  \"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"I don't really know what a _gentleman would_ do with it,\" and he added, under his breath, in English, \"but I know mighty well what this fellow _could_ do with it, if he could get it,\" and he lighted a fresh cigarette.  The keen old eyes had watched his face.  \"I don't suppose _you_ want to buy it?\" she persisted.  \"Well,\" responded the Doctor, \"how can a poor man like me say, if you don't care to name your price, and unless that price is within reason?\"  After some minutes of hesitation the old woman drew a deep breath. \"Well,\" she said, with the determination of one who expected to be scoffed at, \"I won't take a _sou_ less than my brother paid.\"  \"Come on, Mother,\" said the Doctor, \"what _did_ your brother pay? No nonsense, you know.\"  \"Well, if you must know--it was FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS, and I can't and won't sell it for less. There, now!\"  There was a long silence.  The Doctor and his companion avoided one another's eyes. After a while, he said in an undertone, in English: \"By Jove, I'm going to buy it.\"  \"No, no,\" remonstrated his companion, her eyes gazing down the garden vista to where the wistaria and clematis and flaming trumpet flower flaunted on the old wall. \"I am going to have it--I thought of it first. I want it.\"  \"So do I,\" laughed the Doctor. \"Never wanted anything more in all my life.\"  \"For how long,\" she asked, \"would a rover like you want this?\"  \"Rover yourself! And you? Besides what difference does it make how _long_ I want it--since I want it _now_? I want to give a party--haven't given a party since--since Class Day.\"  The Divorcée sighed. Still gazing down the garden she said quietly: \"How well I remember--ninety-two!\"  Then there was another silence before she turned to him suddenly: \"See here--all this is very irregular-so, that being the case--why shouldn't we buy it together? We know each other. Neither of us will ever stay here long. One summer apiece will satisfy us, though it is lovely. Be a sport. We'll draw lots as to who is to have the first party.\"  The Doctor waved the old woman away. Her keen eyes watched too sharply. Then, with their elbows on the table, they had a long and heated argument. Probably there were more things touched on than the garden. Who knows? At the end of it the Divorcée walked away down that garden vista, and the old woman was called and the Doctor took her at her word. And out of that arrangement emerged the scheme which resulted in our finding ourselves, a year later, within the old walls of that French garden.  Of course a year's work had been done on the interior, and Doctor and Divorcée had scoured the department for old furniture. Water had been brought a great distance, a garage had been built with servants' quarters over it--there were no servants in the house,--but the look of the place, we were assured, had not been changed, and both Doctor and Divorcée declared that they had had the year of their lives. Well, if they had, the place showed it.  But, as Fate would have it, the second night we sat down to dinner in that garden, news had come of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand-Charles-Louis Joseph-Marie d'Autriche-Este, whom the tragic death of Prince Rudolphe, almost exactly twenty-four years and six months earlier to a day, had made Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary--and the tone of our gathering was changed. From that day the party threatened to become a little Bedlam, and the garden a rostrum.  In the earlier days it did not make so much difference. The talk was good. We were a travelled group, and what with reminiscences of people and places, and the scandal of courts, it was far from being dull. But as the days went on, and the war clouds began to gather, the overcharged air seemed to get on the nerves of the entire group, and instead of the peaceful summer we had counted upon, every one of us seemed to live in his own particular kind of fever. Every one of us, down to the Youngster, had fixed ideas, deep-set theories, and convictions as different as our characters, our lives, our callings, and our faiths. We were all Cosmopolitan Americans, but ready to spread the Eagle, if necessary, and all of us, except the Violinist, of New England extraction, which means really of English blood, and that _will_ show when the screws are put on. We had never thought of the Violinist as not one of us, but he was really of Polish origin. His great-grandfather had been a companion of Adam Czartoriski in the uprising of 1830, and had gone to the States when the amnesty was not extended to his chief after that rebellion, Poland's last, had been stamped out.  As well as I can remember it was the night of August 6th that the first serious dispute arose. England had declared war. All our male servants had left us except two American chauffeurs, and a couple of old outside men. Two of our four cars, and all our horses but one had been requisitioned. That did not upset us. We had taken on the wives of some of the men, among them Angéle, the pretty wife of one of the French chauffeurs, and her two-months-old baby into the bargain. We still had two cars, that, at a pinch, would carry the party, and we still had one mount in case of necessity.  The question arose as to whether we should break up and make for the nearest port while we could, or \"stick it out.\" It had been finally agreed not to evacuate--_yet_. One does not often get such a chance to see a country at war, and we were all ardent spectators, and all unattached. I imagine not one of us had at that time any idea of being useful--the stupendousness of it all had not dawned on any of us--unless it was the Doctor.  But after the decision of \"stick\" had been passed unanimously, the Critic, who was a bit of a sentimentalist, and if he were anything else was a Norman Angel-lite, stuck his hands in his pockets, and remarked: \"After all, it is perfectly safe to stay, especially now that England is coming in.\"  \"You think so?\" said the Doctor.  \"Sure,\" smiled the Critic. \"The Germans will never cross the French frontier this time. This is not 1870.\"  \"Won't they, and isn't it?\" replied the Doctor sharply.  \"They never can get by Verdun and Belfort.\"  \"Never said they could,\" remarked the Doctor, with a tone as near to a sneer as a good-natured host can allow himself. \"But they'll invade fast enough. I know what I am talking about.\"  \"You don't mean to tell me,\" said the Critic, \"that a nation like Germany--I'm talking now about the people, the country that has been the hot bed of Socialism,--will stand for a war of invasion?\"  That started the Doctor off. He flayed the theorists, the people who reasoned with their emotions and not their brains, the mob that looked at externals, and never saw the fires beneath, the throng that was unable to understand anything outside its own horizon, the mass that pretended to read the history of the world, and because it changed its clothes imagined that it had changed its spirit.  \"Why, I've lived in Germany,\" he cried. \"I was educated there. I know them. I have the misfortune to understand them. They'll stick together and Socialism go hang--as long as there is a hope of victory. The Confederation was cemented in the blood of victory. It can only be dissolved in the blood of defeat. They are a great, a well-disciplined, and an obedient people.\"  \"One would think you admired them and their military system,\" remarked the Critic, a bit crest-fallen at the attack.  \"I may not, but I'll tell you one sure thing if you want a good circus you've got to train your animals. The Kaiser has been a corking ringmaster.\"  Of course this got a laugh, and though both Critic and Journalist tried to strike fire again with words like \"democracy\" and \"civilization,\" the Doctor had cooled down, and nothing could stir him again that night.  Still the discord had been sown. I suppose the dinner-table talk was only a sample of what was going on, in that month, all over the world. It did not help matters that as the days went on we all realized that the Doctor had been right--that France was to be invaded, not across her own proper frontier, but across unprotected Belgium. This seemed so atrocious to most of us that indignation could only express itself in abuse. There was not a night that the dinner-table talk was not bitter. You see the Doctor did not expect the world ever to be perfect--did not know that he wanted it to be--believed in the struggle. On the other hand the Critic, and in a certain sense the Journalist, in spite of their experiences, were more or less Utopian, and the Sculptor and the Violinist purely spectators.  No need to go into the details of the heated arguments. They were only the echo of what all the world,--that had cradled itself into the belief that a great war among the great nations had become, for economic as well as humanitarian reasons, impossible,--were, I imagine, at this time saying.  As nearly as I can remember it was on August 20th that the climax came. Liège had fallen. The English Expedition had landed, and was marching on Belgium. A victorious German army had goose-stepped into defenseless Brussels, and was sweeping out toward the French frontier. The French advance into Alsace had been a blunder.  The Doctor remarked that \"the English had landed twelve days too late,\" and the Journalist drew a graphic, and purely imaginary, picture of the pathos of the Belgians straining their eyes in vain to the West for the coming of the men in khaki, and unfortunately he let himself expatiate a bit on German methods.  The spark touched the Doctor off.  \"By Jove,\" he said, \"all you sentimentalists read the History of the World with your intellects in your breeches pockets. War is not a game for babies. It is war--it is not sport. You chaps think war can be prevented. All I ask you is--why hasn't it been prevented?

But since the generations have contented themselves with talking, and not talked war out of the problem, why, I can't see, for my part, that Germany's way is not as good as any. She is in to win, and so are all the rest of them. Schools of War are like the Schools of Art you chaps talk so much about--it does not make much difference what school one belongs to--the only important thing is making good.\"  \"One would think,\" said the Journalist, \"that you _liked_ such a war.\"  \"Well, I don't even know that I can deny that. I would not deliberately _choose_ it. But I am willing to accept it, and I am not a bit sentimental about it. I am not even sure that it was not needed. The world has let the Kaiser sit twenty-five years on a throne announcing himself as 'God's anointed.' His pretensions have been treated seriously by all the democracies of the world. What for? Purely for personal gain. We have come to a pass where there is little a man won't do--for personal gain. The business of the world, and its diplomacy, have all become so complicated and corrupt that a large percentage of the brains of honest mankind are little willing to touch either. We need shaking up--all of us. If nothing can make man realize that he was not born to be merely happy and get rich, or to have a fine old time, why, such a complete upheaval as this seems to me to be necessary, and for me--if this war can rip off, with its shrapnel, the selfishness with which prosperity has encrusted the lucky: if it can explode our false values with its bombs: if it can break down our absurd pretensions with its cannon,--all I can say is that Germany will have done missionary work for the whole world--herself included.\"  Before he had done, we were all on our feet shouting at him, all but the Lawyer, who smiled into his coffee cup.  \"Why,\" cried the Critic, in anger, \"one would think you held a brief for them!\"  \"I do NOT,\" snapped the Doctor, \"but I don't dislike them any more than I do--well,\" catching himself up with a laugh, \"lots of other people.\"  \"And you mean to tell me,\" said the gentle voice of the Divorcée at his elbow, \"that you calmly face the idea of the hundreds of thousands of men,--well and strong to-day--dead to-morrow,--the thought of the mothers who have borne their sons in pain, and bred them in love, only to fling them before the cannon?\"  \"For what, after all, _are_ we born?\" said the Doctor. \"_Where_ we die, or _when_ is a trifle, since die we must. But _why_ we die and _how_ is vital. It is not only vital to the man that goes--it is vital to the race. It is the struggle, it is the fight, which, no matter what form it takes, makes life worth living. Men struggle for money. Financiers strangle one another at the Bourse. People look on and applaud, in spite of themselves. That is exciting. It is not uplifting. But for men just like you and me to march out to face death for an idea, for honor, for duty, that very fact ennobles the race.\"  \"Ah,\" said the Lawyer, \"I see. The Doctor enjoys the drama of life, but he does not enjoy the purely domestic drama.\"  \"And out of all this,\" said the Trained Nurse, in her level voice, \"you are leaving the Almighty. He gave us a world full of beauty, full of work, full of interest, and he gave us capacities to enjoy it, and endowed us with emotions which make it worth while to live and to die. He gave us simple laws--they are clear enough--they mark sharply the line between good and evil. He left us absolutely free to choose. And behold what man has made of it!\"  \"I deny the statement,\" said the Doctor.  \"That's easy,\" laughed the Journalist.  \"I believe,\" said the Doctor, impatiently, \"that no good comes but through evil. Read your Bible.\"  \"I don't want to read it with _your_ eyes,\" replied the Journalist, and marched testily down the path toward the house.  \"Well,\" snapped the Doctor, \"if I read it with _yours_, I should call on the Almighty to smite this planet with his fires and send us spinning, a flaming brand through space, to annihilation--the great scheme would seem to me a failure--but I don't believe it is.\" And off he marched in the other direction.  The Lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and suppressed, as well as he could, a smile. The Youngster, leaning his elbows on his knees, recited under his breath:      \"And as he sat, all suddenly there rolled,      From where the woman wept upon the sod,      Satan's deep voice, 'Oh Thou unhappy God.'\"  \"Exactly,\" said the Lawyer.  \"What's that?\" asked the Violinist.  \"Only the last three lines of a great little poem by a little great Irishman named Stephens--entitled 'What Satan Said.'\"  \"After all,\" said the Lawyer, \"the Doctor is probably right. It all depends on one's point of view.\"  \"And one's temperament,\" said the Violinist.  \"And one's education,\" said the Critic.  Just here the Doctor came back,--and he came back his smiling self. He made a dash down the path to where the Journalist was evidently sulking, went up behind him, threw an arm over his shoulder, and led him back into the circle.  \"See here,\" he said, \"you are all my guests. I am unreasonably fond of you, even if we can't see Life from the same point of view. Man as an individual, and Man as a part of the Scheme are two different things. I asked you down here to enjoy yourselves, not to argue. I apologize--all my fault--unpardonable of me. Come now--we have decided to stay as long as we can--we are all interested. It is not every generation that has the honor to sit by, and watch two systems meet at the crossroads and dispute the passage to the Future. We'll agree not to discuss the ethics of the matter again. If the men marching out there to the frontier can agree to face the cannon--and there are as many opinions there as here--surely we can _look on_ in silence.\"  And on that agreement we all went to bed.  But on the following day, as we sat in the garden after dinner, our attempts to \"keep off the grass\" were miserably visible. They cast a constraint on the party. Every topic seemed to lead to the forbidden enclosure. It was at a very critical moment that the Sculptor, sitting cross-legged on a bench, in a real Alma Tadema attitude, filled the dangerous pause with:  \"It was in the days of our Lord 1348 that there happened in Florence, the finest city in Italy--\"  And the Violinist, who was leaning against a tree, touched an imaginary mandolin, concluding: \"A most terrible plague.\"  The Critic leaped to his feet.  \"A corking idea,\" he cried.  \"Mine, mine own,\" replied the Sculptor. \"I propose that what those who, in the days of the terrible plague, took refuge at the Villa Palmieri, did to pass away the time, we, who are watching the war approach--as our host says it will--do here. Let us, instead of disputing, each tell a story after dinner--to calm our nerves,--or otherwise.\"  At first every one hooted.  \"I could never tell a story,\" objected the Divorcée.  \"Of course you can,\" declared the Journalist. \"Everybody in the world has one story to tell.\"  \"Sure,\" exclaimed the Lawyer. \"No embargo on subjects?\"  \"I don't know,\" smiled the Doctor. \"There is always the Youngster.\"  \"You go to blazes,\" was the Youngster's response, and he added: \"No war stories. Draw that line.\"  \"Then,\" laughed the Doctor, \"let's make it tales of our own, our native land.\" And there the matter rested. Only, when we separated that night, each of us carried a sealed envelope containing a numbered slip, which decided the question of precedence, and it was agreed that no one but the story-teller should know who was to be the evening's entertainer, until story-telling hour arrived with the coffee and cigarettes.     I  THE YOUNGSTER'S STORY  IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT  THE TALE OF A BRIDE'S NEW HOME   The daytimes were not ever very bad. Short-handed in the pretty garden, every one did a little work. The Lawyer was passionately fond of flowers, and the Youngster did most of the errands. The Sculptor had found some clay, and loved to surprise us at night with a new centre piece for the table, and the Divorcée spent most of her time tending Angéle's baby, while the Doctor and the Nurse were eternally fussing over new kinds of bandages and if ever we got together, it was usually for a little reading aloud at tea-time, or a little music. The spirit of discussion seemed to keep as far away before the lights were up as did the spirit of war, and nothing could be farther than that _appeared_.  The next day we were unusually quiet.  Most of us kept in our rooms in the afternoon. There were those stories to think over, and that we all took it so seriously proved how very much we had been needing some real thing to do. We got through dinner very comfortably.  There was little news in the papers that day except enthusiastic accounts of the reception of the British troops by the French. It was lovely to see the two races that had met on so many battle fields--conquered, and been conquered by one another--embracing with enthusiasm. It was to the credit of all of us that we did not make the inevitable reflections, but only saw the humor and charm of the thing, and remembered the fears that had prevented the plans of tunnelling the channel, only to find them humorous.  The coffee had been placed on the table. The Trained Nurse, as usual, sat behind the tray, and we each went and took our cup, found a comfortable seat in the circle under the trees, where a few yellow lanterns swung in the soft air.  Then the Youngster pulled a white head-band with a huge \"Number One\" on it, out of his pocket, placed it on his head after the manner of the French Conscripts, struck an attitude in the middle of the circle, drew his chair deftly under him, and with the air of an experienced monologist began:         *       *       *       *       *  Not so very many years ago there was a pretty wedding at Trinity Church in"]]]
