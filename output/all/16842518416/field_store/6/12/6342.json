I want to be a big, red rose and grow in a garden.\"  \"Oh, my!\" cried Uncle Wiggily.  \"I never heard of a violet turning into a rose.\"  Then the mother violet spoke and said:  \"I tell my little girl-flower that she ought to be happy to grow here in the nice woods, in the green moss, where it is so cool and moist. But she does not seem to be happy, nor are some of the other violets.\"  \"Well, that isn't right,\" Uncle Wiggily said, kindly.  \"I am sure you violets can do some good in this world.  You are pretty to look at, and nice to smell, and that is more than can be said of some things.\"  \"Oh, I want to do something big!\" said the fault-finding violet.  \"I want to go out in the world and see things.\"  \"So do I!  And I!  And I!\" cried other violets.  Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute, and then he said:  \"I'll do this.  I'll dig up a bunch of you violets, who want a change, and take you with me for a walk.  I will leave some earth on your roots so you won't die, and we shall see what happens.\"  \"Oh, goodie!\" cried the violets.  So Uncle Wiggily dug them up with his paws, putting some cool moss around their roots, and when they had said good-by to the mother violet away they went traveling with the bunny uncle.  \"Oh, this is fine!\" cried the first violet, nodding her head in the breeze.  \"It is very kind of you, Uncle Wiggily to take us with you.  I wish we could do you a kindness.\"  And then a bad old fox jumped out from behind a stump, and started to grab the rabbit gentleman.  But when the fox saw the pretty violets and smelled their sweetness, the fox felt sorry at having been bad and said:  \"Excuse me, Uncle Wiggily.  I'm sorry I tried to bite you.  The sight of those pretty violets makes me feel happier than I did.  I am going to try to be good.\"  \"I am glad of it,\" said Mr. Longears, as he hopped on through the woods.  \"You see, you have already done some good in this world, even if you are only tiny flowers,\" he said to the violets.  Then Uncle Wiggily went on to his hollow stump bungalow, and, reaching there, he heard Nurse Jane saying:  \"Oh, dear!  This is terrible.  Here I have the clothes almost washed, and not a bit of bluing to rinse them in.  Oh, why didn't I tell Wiggy to bring me some blueing from the store?  Oh, dear!\"  \"Ha!  Perhaps these will do to make blue water,\" said the bunny uncle, holding out the bunch of violets.  \"Would you like to help Nurse Jane?\" he asked the flowers.  \"Oh, yes, very much!\" cried the violets.  Then Uncle Wiggily dipped their blue heads in the clean rinsing water--just a little dip so as not to make them catch cold--and enough color came out of the violets to make the water properly blue for Nurse Jane's clothes, so she could finish the washing.  \"So you see you have done more good in the world,\" said Uncle Wiggily to the flowers.  Then he took them back and planted them in the woods where they lived, and very glad they were to return, too.  \"We have seen enough of the world,\" they said, and thereafter they were glad enough to live down in the moss with the mother violet.  And if the umbrella doesn't turn inside out so the handle tickles its ribs and makes it laugh in school, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the high tree.     STORY VII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HIGH TREE  Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit gentleman, stood in front of the looking glass trying on a new tall silk hat he had just bought ready for Easter Sunday, which would happen in about a week or two.  \"Do you think it looks well on me, Nurse Jane?\" asked the bunny uncle, of the muskrat lady housekeeper, who came in from the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow, having just finished washing the dishes.  \"Why, yes, I think your new hat is very nice,\" she said.  \"Do you think I ought to have the holes for my ears cut a little larger?\" asked the bunny uncle.  \"I mean the holes cut, not my ears.\"  \"Well, just a little larger wouldn't hurt any,\" replied Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.  \"I'll cut them for you,\" and she did, with her scissors.  For Uncle Wiggily had to wear his tall silk hat with his ears sticking up through holes cut in it.  His ears were too large to go under the hat, and he could not very well fold them down.  \"There, now I guess I'm all right to go for a walk in the woods,\" said the rabbit gentleman, taking another look at himself in the glass.  It was not a proud look, you understand.  Uncle Wiggily just wanted to look right and proper, and he wasn't at all stuck up, even if his ears were, but he couldn't help that.  So off he started, wondering what sort of an adventure he would have that day.  He passed the place where the blue violets were growing in the green moss--the same violets he had used to make Nurse Jane's blueing water for her clothes the other day, as I told you.  And the violets were glad to see the bunny uncle.  Then Uncle Wiggily met Grandfather Goosey Gander, the nice old goose gentleman, and the two friends walked on together, talking about how much cornmeal you could buy with a lollypop, and all about the best way to eat fried ice cream carrots.  \"That's a very nice hat you have on, Uncle Wiggily,\" said Grandpa Goosey, after a bit.  \"Glad you like it,\" answered the bunny uncle.  \"It's for Easter.\"  \"I think I'll get one for myself,\" went on Mr. Gander.  \"Do you think I would look well in it?\"  \"Try on mine and see,\" offered Uncle Wiggily most kindly.  So he took his new, tall silk hat off his head, pulling his ears out of the holes Nurse Jane had cut for them, and handed it to Grandfather Goosey Gander--handed the hat, I mean, not his ears, though of course the holes went with the hat.  \"There, how do I look?\" asked the goose gentleman.  \"Quite stylish and proper,\" replied Mr. Longears.  \"I'd like to see myself before I buy a hat like this,\" went on Grandpa Goosey.  \"I hope it doesn't make me look too tall.\"  \"Here's a spring of water over by this old stump,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily. \"You can see yourself in that, for it is just like a looking glass.\"  Grandpa Goosey leaned over to see how Uncle Wiggily's tall, silk hat looked, when, all of a sudden, along came a puff of wind, caught the hat under the brim, and as Grandpa Goosey had no ears to hold it on his head (as the bunny uncle had) away sailed the hat up in the air, and it landed right in the top of a big, high tree.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily.  \"Oh, dear!\" said Grandpa Goosey.  \"I'm very sorry that happened.  Oh, dear!\"  \"It wasn't your fault at all,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily kindly.  \"It was the wind.\"  \"But with your nice, new tall silk hat up in that high tree, how are we ever going to get it down,\" asked the goose gentleman.  \"I don't know,\" answered Uncle Wiggily.  \"Let me think.\"  So he thought for a minute or two, and then he said:  \"There are three ways by which we may get the hat down.  One is to ask the wind to blow it back to us, another is to climb up the tree and get the hat ourselves, and the third is to ask the tree to shake it down to us.  We'll try the wind first.\"  So Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey asked the wind that had blown the hat up in the top of the high tree to kindly blow it back again.  But the wind had gone far out to sea, and would not be back for a week.  So that way of getting the hat was of no use.  \"Mr. High Tree, will you kindly shake my hat down to me?\" begged Uncle Wiggily next.  \"I would like to, very much,\" the tree answered politely, \"but I cannot shake when there is no wind to blow me.  We trees cannot shake ourselves, you know.  We can only shake when the wind blows us, and until the wind comes back I cannot shake.\"  \"Too bad!\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Then the only way left for us to do, Grandpa Goosey, is to climb the tree.\"  But this was easier said than done, for neither a rabbit nor a goose gentleman is made for climbing up trees, though when he was a young chap Grandpa Goosey had flown up into little trees, and Uncle Wiggily had jumped over them.  But that was long, long ago.  Try as they did, neither the rabbit gentleman nor the goose gentleman could climb up after the tall silk hat.  \"What are we going to do?\" asked Grandpa Goosey.  \"I don't know,\" replied Mr. Longears.  \"I guess I'll have to go get Billie or Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boys, to climb the tree for us.  Yes, that's what I'll do; and then I can get my hat.\"  Uncle Wiggily started off through the woods to look for one of the Bushytail chaps, while Grandpa Goosey stayed near the tree, to catch the hat in case it should happen to fall by itself.  All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily heard some one coming along whistling, and then he heard a loud pounding sound, and next he saw Toodle Flat-tail, the beaver boy, walking in the woods.  \"Oh, Toodle!  You're the very one I want!\" cried Uncle Wiggily.  \"My hat is in a high tree and I can't get it.  With your strong teeth, just made for cutting down trees, will you kindly cut down this one, and get my hat for me?\"  \"I will,\" said the little beaver chap.  But when he began to gnaw the tree, to make it fall, the tree cried:  \"Oh, Mr. Wind, please come and blow on me so I can shake Uncle Wiggily's hat to him, and then I won't have to be gnawed down.  Please blow, Mr. Wind.\"  So the wind hurried back and blew the tree this way and that.  Down toppled Uncle Wiggily's hat, not in the least hurt, and so everything was all right again, and Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey and Toodle Flat-tail were happy.  And the tree was extra glad as it did not have to be gnawed down.  [Illustration: Down toppled Uncle Wiggily's hat, not in the least hurt.]  And if the little mouse doesn't go to sleep in the cat's cradle and scare poor pussy so her tail swells up like a balloon, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the peppermint.     STORY VIII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PEPPERMINT  \"Uncle Wiggily, would you mind going to the store for me?\" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, one morning, as she came in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17807"],["title","Uncle Wiggily in the Woods (#5)"],["body","the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow, where she had been getting ready the breakfast for the rabbit gentleman.  \"Go to the store?  Why of course I'll go, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,\" answered the bunny uncle.  \"Which store?\"  \"The drug store.\"  \"The drug store?  What do you want; talcum powder or court plaster?\"  \"Neither one,\" answered Nurse Jane.  \"I want some peppermint.\"  \"Peppermint candy?\" Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.  \"Not exactly,\" went on Nurse Jane.  \"But I want a little of the peppermint juice with which some kind of candy is flavored.  I want to take some peppermint juice myself, for I have indigestion.  Dr. Possum says peppermint is good for it.  I must have eaten a little too much cheese pudding last night.\"  \"I'll get you the peppermint with pleasure,\" said the bunny uncle, starting off with his tall silk hat and his red, white and blue striped rheumatism barber pole crutch.  \"Better get it in a bottle,\" spoke Nurse Jane, with a laugh.  \"You can't carry peppermint in your pocket, unless it's peppermint candy, and I don't want that kind.\"  \"All right,\" Uncle Wiggily said, and then, with the bottle, which Nurse Jane gave him, he hopped on, over the fields and through the woods to the drug store.  But when he got there the cupboard was bare--.  No!  I mustn't say that.  It doesn't belong here.  I mean when Uncle Wiggily reached the drug store it was closed, and there was a sign in the door which said the monkey-doodle gentleman who kept the drug store had gone to a baseball-moving-picture show, and wouldn't be back for a long while.  \"Then I wonder where I am going to get Nurse Jane's peppermint?\" asked Uncle Wiggily of himself.  \"I'd better go see if Dr. Possum has any.\"  But while Uncle Wiggily was going on through the woods once more, he gave a sniff and a whiff, and, all of a sudden, he smelled a peppermint smell.  The rabbit gentleman stood still, looking around and making his pink nose twinkle like a pair of roller skates.  While he was doing this along came a cow lady chewing some grass for her complexion.  \"What are you doing here, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked the cow lady.  Uncle Wiggily told her how he had gone to the drug store for peppermint for Nurse Jane, and how he had found the store closed, so he could not get any.  \"But I smell peppermint here in the woods,\" went on the bunny uncle. \"Can it be that the drug store monkey doodle has left some here for me?\"  \"No, what you smell is--that,\" said the cow lady, pointing her horns toward some green plants growing near a little babbling brook of water. The plants had dark red stems that were square instead of round.  \"It does smell like peppermint,\" said Uncle Wiggily, going closer and sniffing and snuffing.  \"It is peppermint,\" said the cow lady.  \"That is the peppermint plant you see.\"  \"Oh, now I remember,\" Uncle Wiggily exclaimed.  \"They squeeze the juice out of the leaves, and that's peppermint flavor for candy or for indigestion.\"  \"Exactly,\" spoke the cow lady, \"and I'll help you squeeze out some of this juice in the bottle for Nurse Jane.\"  Then Uncle Wiggily and the cow lady pulled up some of the peppermint plants and squeezed out the juice between two clean, flat stones, the cow lady stepping on them while Uncle Wiggily caught the juice in the empty bottle as it ran out.  \"My!  But that is strong!\" cried the bunny uncle, as he smelled of the bottle of peppermint.  It was so sharp that it made tears come into his eyes.  \"I should think that would cure indigestion and everything else,\" he said to the cow lady.  \"Tell Nurse Jane to take only a little of it in sweet water,\" said the cow lady.  \"It is very strong.  So be careful of it.\"  \"I will,\" promised Uncle Wiggily.  \"And thank you for getting the peppermint for me.  I don't know what I would have done without you, as the drug store was closed.\"  Then he hopped on through the woods to the hollow stump bungalow.  He had not quite reached it when, all of a sudden, there was a rustling in the hushes, and out from behind a bramble bush jumped a big black bear. Not a nice good bear, like Neddie or Beckie Stubtail, but a bear who cried:  \"Ah, ha!  Oh, ho!  Here is some one whom I can bite and scratch!  A nice tender rabbit chap!  Ah, ha!  Oh, ho!\"  \"Are--are you going to scratch and bite me?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"I am,\" said the bear, snappish like.  \"Get ready.  Here I come!\" and he started toward Uncle Wiggily, who was so frightened that he could not hop away.  \"I'm going to hug you, too,\" said the bear.  Bears always hug, you know.  \"Well, this is, indeed, a sorry day for me,\" said Uncle Wiggily, sadly. \"Still, if you are going to hug, bite and scratch me, I suppose it can't be helped.\"  \"Not the least in the world can it be helped,\" said the bear, cross-like and unpleasant.  \"So don't try!\"  \"Well, if you are going to hug me I had better take this bottle out of my pocket, so when you squeeze me the glass won't break,\" Uncle Wiggily said.  \"Here, when you are through being so mean to me perhaps you will be good enough to take this to Nurse Jane for her indigestion, but don't hug her.\"  \"I won't,\" promised the bear, taking the bottle which Uncle Wiggily handed him.  \"What's in it?\"  Before Uncle Wiggily could answer, the bear opened the bottle, and, seeing something in it, cried:  \"I guess I'll taste this.  Maybe it's good to eat.\"  Down his big, red throat he poured the strong peppermint juice, and then--well, I guess you know what happened.  \"Oh, wow!  Oh, me!  Oh, my!  Wow!  Ouch!  Ouchie!  Itchie!\" roared the bear.  \"My throat is on fire!  I must have some water!\"  And, dropping the bottle, away he ran to the spring, leaving Uncle Wiggily safe, and not hurt a bit.  Then the rabbit gentleman hurried back and squeezed out more peppermint juice for Nurse Jane, whose indigestion was soon cured.  And as for the bear, he had a sore throat for a week and a day.  So this teaches us that peppermint is good for scaring bears, as well as for putting in candy.  And if the snow man doesn't come in our house and sit by the gas stove until he melts into a puddle of molasses, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the birch tree.     STORY IX  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BIRCH TREE  Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old rabbit gentleman, was walking along through the woods one afternoon, when he came to the hollow stump school, where the lady mouse teacher taught the animal boys and girls how to jump, crack nuts, dig homes under ground, and do all manner of things that animal folk have to do.  And just as the rabbit gentleman was wondering whether or not school was out, he heard a voice inside the hollow stump, saying:  \"Oh, dear!  I wish I had some one to help me.  I'll never get them clean all by myself.  Oh, dear!\"  \"Ha!  That sounds like trouble!\" thought Mr. Longears to himself.  \"I wonder who it is, and if I can help?  I guess I'd better see.\"  He looked in through a window, and there he saw the lady mouse teacher cleaning off the school black-boards.  The boards were all covered with white chalk marks, you see.  \"What's the matter, lady mouse teacher?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, making a polite, low bow.  \"Oh, I told Johnnie and Billy Bushytail, the two squirrel boys, to stay in and clean off the black-boards, so they would be all ready for tomorrow's lesson,\" said the lady mouse.  \"But they forgot, and ran off to play ball with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog boys.  So I have to clean the boards myself.  And I really ought to be home now, for I am very tired.\"  \"Then you trot right along,\" said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.  \"Tie a knot in your tail, so you won't step on it, and hurry along.\"  \"But what about the black-boards?\" asked the lady mouse.  \"They must be cleaned off.\"  \"I'll attend to that,\" promised the bunny uncle.  \"I will clean them myself.  Run along, Miss Mouse.\"  So Miss Mouse thanked the bunny uncle, and ran along, and the rabbit gentleman began brushing the chalk marks off the black-boards, at the same time humming a little tune that went this way:    \"I'd love to be a teacher,     Within a hollow stump.   I'd teach the children how to fall,     And never get a bump.    I'd let them out at recess,     A game of tag to play;   I'd give them all fresh lollypops     'Most every other day!\"   \"Oh, my!  Wouldn't we just love to come to school to you!\" cried a voice at the window, and, looking up.  Uncle Wiggily saw Billie Bushytail, the boy squirrel, and brother Johnnie with him.  \"Ha!  What happened you two chaps?\" asked the bunny uncle.  \"Why did you run off without cleaning the black-boards for the lady mouse teacher?\"  \"We forgot,\" said Johnnie, sort of ashamed-like and sorry.  \"That's what we came back to do--clean the boards.\"  \"Well, that was good of you,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily.   \"But I have the boards nearly cleaned now.\"  \"Then we will give them a dusting with our tails, and that will finish them,\" said Billie, and the squirrel boys did, so the black-boards were very clean.  \"Now it's time to go home,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  So he locked the school, putting the key under the doormat, where the lady mouse could find it in the morning, and, with the Bushytail squirrel boys, he started off through the woods.  \"You and Billie can go back to your play, now, Johnnie,\" said the bunny uncle.  \"It was good of you to leave it to come back to do what you were told.\"  The three animal friends hopped and scrambled on together, until, all of a sudden, the bad old fox, who so often had made trouble for Uncle Wiggily, jumped out from behind a bush, crying:  \"Ah, ha!  Now I have you, Mr. Longears--and two squirrels besides. Good luck!\"  \"Bad luck!\" whispered Billie.  The fox made a grab for the rabbit gentleman, but, all of a sudden, the paw of the bad creature slipped in some mud and down he went, head first, into a puddle of water, coughing and sneezing.  \"Come on, Uncle Wiggily!\" quickly cried Billie and Johnnie.  \"This is our chance.  We'll run away before the fox gets the water out of his"]]]
