In the seventeenth century we may cite the names of della Valle, Baldaeus, Tavernier, Bernier and the German Mandelslo for India, while those of Olearius and Chardin are most famous in connection with Persia. And that books of travel were much read in Germany is attested by the number of editions and translations which appeared there. Thus among the earliest books printed there we have a translation of Marco Polo (Nuremberg), 1477,[50] reprinted repeatedly, e.g. at Augsburg, 1481, in the _Novus Orbis_, 1534 (Latin version), at Basle, 1534 (German translation of the preceding), while Mandeville's memoirs were so popular as to become finally a _Volksbuch_.[51]  The account of Olearius is of special interest to us. It gives an excellent description of Persia, and above all it gives us valuable information on the literature and language. Olearius is struck by the similarity of many Persian words to corresponding words in German and Latin, and hints at the kinship of these idioms, though, looking only at the vocabulary and not at the structure, he supposes Persian to be related to Arabic.[52] He tells us of the high esteem in which poetry was held by the Persians, and notices that rhyme is an indispensable requisite of their poetic art. He also mentions some of their leading poets, among them Saʻdī, H̱āfiḍ, Firdausī and Niḍāmī.[53]         *       *       *       *       *  But what interests us most is the translation which he made of the _Gulistān_, published in 1654, under the title of _Persianischer Rosenthal_. True, it was not the first in point of time. As early as 1634 du Ryer had published at Paris an incomplete French version, and shortly afterwards this version was translated into German by Johann Friedrich Ochsenbach of Tübingen, but apparently without attracting much notice.[54] In 1644, Levin Warner of Leyden had given the Persian text and Latin version of a number of Saʻdī's maxims,[55] while Gentius had published the whole text with a Latin translation at Amsterdam in 1651. But it was the version of Olearius that really introduced the _Gulistān_ to Europe.  The edition of Olearius, from which we have cited, contains also a translation of the _Būstān_, called _Der Persianische Baumgarten_, made, however, not directly from the Persian, but from a Dutch version. Besides this, the edition contains also the narratives of two other travellers, Jürgen Andersen and Volquard Iversen, as well as an account of Persia by the French missionary Sanson. Iversen, in speaking of the Parsi religion, gives an essentially correct account of the Zoroastrian hierarchy, of the supreme god and his seven servants, each presiding over some special element, evidently an allusion to Ahura Mazda and his six Amesha Spentas, with the possible addition of Sraosha.[56] Sanson states that the _Gavres_ have kept up the old Persian language and that it is entirely different from modern Persian,[57] a distinct recognition of the existence of the Avestan language. The eighteenth century saw the discovery of the _Avesta_ by Anquetil du Perron, and its close found men like Jones, Revizky, de Sacy and Hammer busily engaged in spreading a knowledge of Persian literature in Europe.         *       *       *       *       *  India, as far as its literature was concerned, did not fare so well. The struggles of European nations for the mastery of that rich empire did little towards promoting a knowledge of its religion or its language. Nor were the efforts of missionaries very successful. Most of their attention was devoted to the Dravidian idioms of Southern India, not to Sanskrit. We have the authority of Friedrich Schlegel for the statement that before his time there were but two Germans who were known to have gained a knowledge of the sacred language, the missionary Heinrich Roth and the Jesuit Hanxleben.[58] Even their work was not published and was superseded by that of Jones, Colebrooke and others. Most valuable information on Hindu religion was given by the Dutch preacher Abraham Roger in his well known book _De Open-Deure tot het Verborgen Heydendom_, published at Leyden in 1651, two years after the author's death. This book also gave to the West the first specimen of Sanskrit literature in the shape of a Dutch version of two hundred maxims of Bhartṛhari, not a direct translation from the Sanskrit, but based on oral communication imparted by a learned Brahman Padmanaba.[59] As a rule the rendering is very faithful, sometimes even literal. The maxims were translated into German by C. Arnold and were published at Nuremberg in 1663.  This, however, ended the progress of Sanskrit literature in Europe for the time being. Information came in very slowly. The _Lettres Édifiantes_ of the Jesuits, and the accounts of travellers like Sonnerat began to shed additional light on the religious customs of India, but its sacred language remained a secret. In 1785, Herder wrote that what Europe knew of Hindu literature was only late legends, that the Sanskrit language as well as the genuine Vēda would probably for a long time remain unknown.[60] Sir William Jones, however, had founded the Asiatic Society a year before and the first step towards the discovery of Sanskrit had really thus been taken.  But let us consider what bearing all this had on German poetry. In this field the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were desperately dreary. In the former century the leading thinkers of Germany were absorbed in theological controversy, while in the next the Thirty Years' War completely crushed the spirit of the nation. There is little poetry in this period that calls for even passing notice in this investigation. Paul Fleming, although he was with Olearius in Persia, has written nothing that would interest us here. Andreas Gryphius took the subject for his drama \"Catharina von Georgien\" (1657) from Persian history. It is the story of the cruel execution of the Georgian queen by order of Shāh ʻAbbās in 1624.[61] Nor is Oriental influence in the eighteenth century more noticeable. Occasionally an Oriental touch is brought in. Pfeffel makes his \"Bramine\" read a lesson to bigots; Matthias Claudius in his well-known poem makes Herr Urian pay a visit to the Great Mogul; Bürger, in his salacious story of the queen of Golkonde, transports the lovers to India; Lessing, in \"Minna von Barnhelm\" (Act i. Sc. 12) represents Werner as intending to take service with Prince Heraklius of Persia, and he chooses an Oriental setting for his \"Nathan der Weise.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the prose writings of this period Oriental influence is much more discernible. In the literature dealing with magic Zoroaster always played a prominent part. The invention of the Cabala was commonly ascribed to him.[62] European writers on the black art, as for instance Bodinus, whose _De Magorum Dæmonomania_ was translated by Fischart (Strassburg, 1591), repeat about Zoroaster all the fables found in classical or patristic writers. So the Iranian sage figures prominently also in the Faust-legend. He is the prince of magicians whose book Faust studies so diligently that he is called a second Zoroastris.[63] This book passes into the hands of Faust's pupil Christoph Wagner, who uses it as diligently as his master.[64]  In all this folkbook-literature India is a mere name. Thus in the oldest Faust-book of 1587 the sorcerer makes a journey in the air through England, Spain, France, Sweden, Poland, Denmark, India, Africa and Persia, and finally comes to _Morenland_.[65]  Of all the prose-writings, however, the novel, which began to flourish luxuriously in the seventeenth century, showed the most marked tendency to make use of Eastern scenery and episodes, and incidentally to exhibit the author's erudition on everything Oriental. Thus Grimmelshausen transports his hero Simplicissimus into Asia through the device of Tartar captivity. Lohenstein, in his ultra-Teutonic romance of Arminius, manages to introduce an Armenian princess and a prince from Pontus. The latter, as we learn from the autobiography with which he favors us in the fifth book, has been in India. He took with him a Brahman sage, who burned himself on reaching Greece. Evidently Lohenstein had read Arrian's description of the burning of Kalanos (Arrian vii. 2, 3). The _Asiatische Banise_ of Heinrich Anselm von Ziegler-Kliphausen, perhaps the most popular German novel of the seventeenth century, was based directly on the accounts of travellers to Farther India, not on Greek or Latin writings.[66] Other authors who indulged their predilection for Oriental scenery were Buchholtz in his _Herkules und Valisca_ (1659), Happel in _Der Asiatische Onogambo_ (Hamb. 1673), Bohse (Talander) in _Die durchlauchtigste Alcestis aus Persien_ (Leipz. 1689) and others.[67]  The most striking instance of the Oriental tendency is furnished by Grimmelshausen's _Joseph_, first published probably in 1667.[68] Here we meet the famous story of Yūsuf and Zalīχā as it is given in the _Qurān_ or in the poems of Firdausī and Jāmī. The well-known episode of the ladies cutting their hands instead of the lemons in consequence of their confusion at the sight of Joseph's beauty is here narrated at length.[69] In the preface the author states explicitly that he has drawn, not only from the Bible, but from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian writings as well.[70] That he should have made use of Arabic material is credible enough, for Dutch Orientalists like Golius and Erpenius had made this accessible.[71] That he had some idea of Persian poetry is shown by his allusions to the fondness of Orientals for handsome boys.[72] On the other hand, what he says of Zoroaster in the _Musai_ can all be found in Latin and Greek writers.[73] Here we get the biography of Joseph's chief servant in the form of an appendix to the novel, and the author displays all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],["title","The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#4)"],["body","learning which fortunately his good taste had excluded from the story itself. Of the Iranian tradition concerning Zoroaster's death as given in the Pahlavī writings or the _Shāh Nāmah_[74] Grimmelshausen knew absolutely nothing; nor can we find the slightest evidence to substantiate his assertion that for the work in question he drew from Persian or Arabic sources.         *       *       *       *       *  In the eighteenth century the Oriental tale was extremely popular in France, and thence it spread to other countries. The translation of the Thousand and One Nights by Galland (Paris, 1704-1712) and of the Persian Tales by Pétis de La Croix called into being a host of similar French productions, which in turn found their way into German literature. The most fruitful writer in this genre was Simon Gueulette, the author of _Soirées Bretonnes_ (1712) and _Mille et un quart d'heures_ (1715). The latter contains the story of a prince who is punished for his presumption by having two snakes grow from his shoulders. To appease them they are fed on fresh human brain.[75] Of course, we recognize at once the story of the tyrant Ẕaẖẖāk familiar from Firdausī. The material for the _Soirées_ was drawn largely from Armeno's _Peregrinaggio_, which purports to be a translation from the Persian, although no original is known to scholars.[76] From these _Soirées_ Voltaire took the material for his _Zadig_.[77] In most cases, however, all that was Oriental about such stories was the name and the costume. So popular was the Oriental costume that Montesquieu used it for satirizing the Parisians in his _Lettres Persanes_ (1721). Through French influence the Oriental story came to Germany, and so we get such works as August Gottlob Meissner's tales of _Nushirvan_, _Massoud_, _Giaffar_, _Sadi_ and others,[78] or Klinger's _Derwisch_. Wieland used the Eastern costume in his _Schach Lolo_ (1778) and in his politico-didactic romance of the wise Danischmende. This fondness for an Oriental atmosphere continues even into the nineteenth century and may be seen in such works as Tieck's _Abdallah_ and Hauff's _Karawane_. But this brings us to the time when India and Persia were to give up their secrets, and when the influence of their literature begins to be a factor in the literature of Europe.

Herder's Interest in the Orient--Fourth Collection of his       Zerstreute Blätter--His Didactic Tendency And Predilection For       Saʻdī.   The epoch-making work of the English Orientalists, and above all, of the illustrious Sir William Jones, at the end of the eighteenth century not only laid the foundation of Sanskrit scholarship in Europe, but also gave the first direct impulse to the Oriental movement which in the first half of the nineteenth century manifests itself so strikingly both in English as well as in German literature, especially in the work of the poets. In Germany this movement came just at the time when the idea of a universal literature had taken hold of the minds of the leading literary men, and so it was very natural that the pioneer and prophet of this great idea should also be the first to introduce into German poetry the new _west-östliche Richtung_.  Herder's theological studies turned his attention to the East at an early age. As is well known, he always had a fervid admiration for the Hebrew poets, but we have evidence to show, that, even before the year 1771, when Jones' _Traité sur la poésie orientale_ appeared, he had widened the sphere of his Oriental studies and had become interested in Saʻdī.[79] Rhymed paraphrases made by him of some stories from the _Gulistān_ date from the period 1761-1764,[80] and, as occasional references prove, Saʻdī continued to hold his attention until the appearance, in 1792, of the fourth Collection of the _Zerstreute Blätter_, which contains the bulk of Herder's translation from Persian and Sanskrit literature, and which therefore will have to occupy our attention.[81]  Of this collection the following are of interest to us: 1°. Four books of translations, more or less free, of maxims from the _Gulistān_, entitled _Blumen aus morgenländischen Dichtern gesammlet_. 2°. Translations from the Sanskrit consisting of maxims from the _Hitōpadēśa_ and from Bhartṛhari and passages from the _Bhagavadgītā_ under the name of _Gedanken einiger Bramanen_. 3°. A number of versions from Persian, Sanskrit, Hebrew and Arabic poets given in the Suphan edition as _Vermischte Stücke_.  The first three books of the _Blumen_ consist entirely of maxims from the _Gulistān_, the versions of Gentius, or sometimes of Olearius, being the basis, while the fourth book contains also poems from Rūmī, H̱āfiḍ and others (some not Persian), taken mostly from Jones' well known _Poeseos_.[82] For the _Gedanken_ our poet made use of Wilkins' translation of the _Hitōpadēśa_ (1787) and of the _Bhagavadgītā_ (1785), together with the German version of Bhartṛhari by Arnold from Roger's Dutch rendering.  As Herder did not know either Sanskrit or Persian, his versions are translations of translations, and it is not surprising if the sense of the original is sometimes very much altered, especially when we consider that the translations on which he depended were not always accurate.[83] In most cases, however, the sense is fairly well preserved, sometimes even with admirable fidelity, as in \"Lob der Gottheit\" (_Bl._ i. 1), which is a version of passages from the introduction to the _Gulistān_. No attention whatever is paid to the form of the originals. For the selections from Saʻdī the distich which had been used for the versions from the Greek anthology is the favorite form. Rhyme, which in Persian poetry is an indispensable requisite, is never employed.         *       *       *       *       *  The moralizing tendency which characterizes all of Herder's work, and which grew stronger as he advanced in years, rendered him indifferent to the purely artistic side of poetry. He makes no effort in his versions to bring out what is characteristically Oriental in the original; on the contrary, he often destroys it. Thus his \"Blume des Paradieses\" (_Bl._ iv. 7 = H̱. 548) is addressed to a girl instead of a boy. The fourth couplet is accordingly altered to suit the sense, while the last couplet, which according to the law governing the construction of the Persian _γazal_ contained the name of the poet, is omitted. So also in \"Der heilige Wahnsinn\" (_Verm._ 6 = _Gul._ v. 18, ed. Platts, p. 114) the characteristic Persian phrase       از دريچهء چشم مجنون بجمال ليلی بايستی مطالعه کردن       \"It is necessary to survey Laīlā's beauty from the window of      Majnūn's eye\"  appears simply as \"O ... sieh mit meinen Augen an.\"  This exclusive interest in the purely didactic side induced Herder also to remove the maxims from the stories which in the _Gulistān_ or _Hitōpadēśa_ served as their setting. So they appear simply as general sententious literature, whereas in the "]]]
