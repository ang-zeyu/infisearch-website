The underside of the bark, next to the tree, and the tree itself, is very slippery when it is wet.  Very slippery indeed.\"  \"Well, I hope you don't slip,\" said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.  \"I hope so, too,\" Dr. Possum said.  \"But I am taking this slippery elm bark to mix with some of the bitter medicine I have to give Billie Wagtail, the goat boy.  When I put some bark from the slippery elm tree in Billie's medicine it will slip down his throat so quickly that he will never know he took it.\"  \"Good!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, laughing.  Then the bunny uncle went close to the tree, off which Dr. Possum was taking some bark, and felt of it with his paw.  The tree was indeed as slippery as an icy sidewalk slide on Christmas eve.  \"My!\" exclaimed Mr. Longears.  \"If I tried to climb up that tree I'd do nothing but slip down.\"  \"That's right,\" said Dr. Possum.  \"But I must hurry on now to give Billie Wagtail his medicine.\"  So Dr. Possum went on his way and Uncle Wiggily hopped along until, pretty soon, he heard a rustling in the bushes, and a voice said:  \"But, Squeaky-Eeky dear, I can't find any snow hill for you to ride down on your sled.  The snow is all gone, you see.  It is Spring now.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried another voice.  \"Such a lot of trouble.  Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\"  \"Ha!  Trouble!\" said Uncle Wiggily to himself.  \"This is where I come in.  I must see if I cannot help them.\"  He looked through the bushes, and there he saw Jillie Longtail, the little girl mouse, and with her was Squeaky-Eeky, the cousin mouse. And Squeaky-Eeky had a small sled with her.  \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, for he saw that Squeaky-Eeky had been crying.  \"What is the matter, little mice?\"  \"Oh, hello.  Uncle Wiggily!\" cried Jillie.  \"I don't know what to do with my little cousin mouse.  You see she wants to slide down hill on her Christmas sled, but there isn't any snow on any of the hills now.\"  \"No, that's true, there isn't,\" said the bunny uncle.  \"But, Squeaky, why didn't you slide down hill in the Winter, when there was snow?\"  \"Because, I had the mouse-trap fever, then,\" answered Squeaky-Eeky, \"and I couldn't go out.  But now I am all better and I can be out, and oh, dear!  I do so much want a ride down hill on my sled.  Boo, hoo!\"  \"Don't cry, Squeaky, dear,\" said Jillie.  \"If there is no snow you can't slide down hill, you know.\"  \"But I want to,\" said the little cousin mouse, unreasonable like.  \"But you can't; so please be nice,\" begged Jillie.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Squeaky.  \"I do so much want to slide down hill on my sled.\"  \"And you shall!\" suddenly exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.  \"Come with me, Squeaky.\"  \"Why, Uncle Wiggily!\" cried Jillie.  \"How can you give Squeaky a slide down hill when there is no snow?  You need a slippery snow hill for sleigh-riding.\"  \"I am not so sure of that,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, with a smile.  \"Let us see.\"  Off through the woods he hopped, with Jillie and Squeaky following. Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily came to a big tree that had fallen down, one end being raised up higher than the other, like a hill, slanting.  With his strong paws and his sharp teeth, the rabbit gentleman began peeling the bark off the tree, showing the white wood underneath.  \"What are you doing, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Jillie.  \"This is a slippery elm tree, and I am making a hill so Squeaky-Eeky can slide down,\" answered the bunny uncle.  \"Underneath the bark the trunk of the elm tree is very slippery.  Dr. Possum told me so.  See how my paw slips!\" And indeed it did, sliding down the sloping tree almost as fast as you can eat a lollypop.  Uncle Wiggily took off a lot of bark from the elm tree, making a long, sliding, slippery place.  \"Now, try that with your sled, Squeaky-Eeky,\" said the bunny uncle. And the little cousin mouse did.  She put her sled on the slanting tree, sat down and Jillie gave her a little push.  Down the slippery elm tree went Squeaky as fast as anything, coming to a stop in a pile of soft leaves.  \"Oh, what a lovely slide!\" cried Squeaky.  \"You try it, Jillie.\"  And the little mouse girl did.  \"Who would think,\" she said, \"that you could slide down a slippery elm tree?  But you can.\"  Then she and Squeaky took turns sliding down hill, even though there was no snow, and the slippery elm tree didn't mind it a bit, but rather liked it.  And if the coal man doesn't take away our gas shovel to shoot some tooth powder into the wax doll's pop gun, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the sassafras.     STORY IV  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SASSAFRAS  \"Uncle Wiggily!  Uncle Wiggily!  Get up!\" called Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she stood at the foot of the stairs of the hollow stump bungalow and called up to the rabbit gentleman one morning.  \"Hurry down, Mr. Longears,\" she went on.  \"This is the last day I am going to bake buckwheat cakes, and if you want some nice hot ones, with maple sugar sauce on, you'd better hurry.\"  No answer came from the bunny uncle.  \"Why, this is strange,\" said Nurse Jane to herself.  \"I wonder if anything can have happened to him?  Did he have an adventure in the night?  Did the bad skillery-scalery alligator, with humps on its tail, carry him off?\"  Then she called again:  \"Uncle Wiggily!  Uncle Wiggily!  Aren't you going to get up?  Come down to breakfast.  Aren't you going to get up and come down?\"  \"No, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,\" replied the bunny uncle, \"not to give you a short answer, I am not going to get up, or come down or eat breakfast or do anything,\" and Mr. Longears spoke as though his head was hidden under the bed clothes, which it was.  \"Oh, Uncle Wiggily, whatever is the matter?\" asked Nurse Jane, surprised like and anxious.  \"I don't feel at all well,\" was the answer.  \"I think I have the epizootic, and I don't want any breakfast.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Nurse Jane.  \"And all the nice cakes I have baked.  I know what I'll do,\" she said to herself.  \"I'll call in Dr. Possum. Perhaps Uncle Wiggily needs some of the roots and herbs that grow in the woods--wintergreen, slippery elm or something like that.  I'll call Dr. Possum.\"  And when the animal doctor came he looked at the bunny uncle's tongue, felt of his ears, and said:  \"Ha!  Hum!  You have the Spring fever, Uncle Wiggily.  What you need is sassafras.\"  \"Nurse Jane has some in the bungalow,\" spoke Mr. Longears.  \"Tell her to make me some tea from that.\"  \"No, what is needed is fresh sassafras,\" said Dr. Possum.  \"And, what is more, you must go out in the woods and dig it yourself.  That will be almost as good for your Spring fever as the sassafras itself.  So hop out, and dig some of the roots.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, fussy like.  \"I don't want to.  I'd rather stay here in bed.\"  \"But you can't!\" cried Dr. Possum in his jolly voice.  \"Out with you!\" and he pulled the bed clothes off the bunny uncle so he had to get up to keep warm.  \"Well, I'll just go out and dig a little sassafras root to please him,\" thought Uncle Wiggily to himself, \"and then I'll come back and stay in bed as long as I please.  It's all nonsense thinking I have to have fresh root--the old is good enough.\"  \"I do feel quite wretched and lazy like,\" said Uncle Wiggily to himself, as he limped along on his red, white and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch, that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk.  \"As soon as I find some sassafras I'll pull up a bit of the root and hurry back home and to bed.\"  Pretty soon the bunny uncle saw where some of the sassafras roots were growing, with their queer three-pointed leaves, like a mitten, with a place for your finger and thumb.  \"Now to pull up the root,\" said the bunny uncle, as he dug down in the ground a little way with his paws, to get a better hold.  But pulling up sassafras roots is not as easy as it sounds, as you know if you have ever tried it.  The roots go away down in the earth, and they are very strong.  Uncle Wiggily pulled and tugged and twisted and turned, but he could break off only little bits of the underground stalk.  \"This won't do!\" he said to himself.  \"If I don't get a big root Dr. Possum will, perhaps, send me hack for more.  I'll try again.\"  He got his paws under a nice, big root, and he was straining his back to pull it up, when, all of a sudden, he heard a voice saying:  \"How do you do?\"  \"Oh, hello!\" exclaimed the bunny, looking up quickly, and expecting to see some friend of his, like Grandpa Goosey Gander, or Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy.  But, instead, he saw the bad old fox, who had, so many times, tried to catch the rabbit gentleman.  \"Oh!\" said Uncle Wiggily, astonished like.  And again he said: \"Oh!\"  \"Surprised, are you?\" asked the fox, sort of curling his whiskers around his tongue, sarcastic fashion.  \"A little--yes,\" answered Uncle Wiggily.  \"I didn't expect to see you.\"  \"But I've been expecting you a long time,\" said the fox, grinning most impolitely.  \"In fact, I've been waiting for you.  Just as soon as you have pulled up that sassafras root you may come with me.  I'll take you off to my den, to my dear little foxes Eight, Nine and Ten.  Those are their numbers.  It's easier to number them than name them.\"  \"Oh, indeed?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, as politely as he could, considering everything.  \"And so you won't take me until I pull this sassafras root?\"  \"No, I'll wait until you have finished,\" spoke the fox.  \"I like you better, anyhow, flavored with sassafras.  So pull away.\"  Uncle Wiggily tried to pull up the root, but he did not pull very hard.  \"For,\" he thought, \"as soon as I pull it up then the fox will take me, but if I don't pull it he may not.\"  \"What's the matter?  Can't you get that root up?\" asked the fox, after a while.  \"I can't wait all day.\"  \"Then perhaps you will kindly pull it up for me,\" said the bunny uncle. \"I can't seem to do it.\"  \"All right, I will,\" the fox said.  Uncle Wiggily hopped to one side. The fox put his paws under the sassafras root.  And he pulled and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17807"],["title","Uncle Wiggily in the Woods (#3)"],["body","and he pulled, and finally, with a double extra strong pull, he pulled up the root.  But it came up so suddenly, just as when you break the point off your pencil, that the fox keeled over backward in a peppersault and somersault also.  \"Oh, wow!\" cried the fox, as he bumped his nose.  \"What happened?\"  But Uncle Wiggily did not stay to tell.  Away ran the bunny through the woods, as fast as he could go, forgetting all about his Spring fever. He was all over it.  \"I thought the sassafras would cure you,\" said Dr. Possum, when Uncle Wiggily was safely home once more.  \"The fox helped some,\" said the bunny uncle, with a laugh.  And if the black cat doesn't cover himself with talcum powder and make believe he's a white kid glove going to a dance, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Jack-in-the-Pulpit.     STORY V  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PULPIT-JACK  \"Well, how are you feeling today, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit gentleman taking his tall silk hat down off the china closet, getting ready to go for a walk in the woods one morning.  \"Why, I'm feeling pretty fine, Nurse Jane,\" answered the bunny uncle. \"Since I ran home to get away from the fox, after he turned a peppersault from pulling too strong to get up the sassafras root, I feel much better, thank you.\"  \"Good!\" cried Nurse Jane.  \"Then perhaps you would not mind going to the store for me.\"  \"Certainly not,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily.  \"What do you wish?\"  \"A loaf of bread,\" replied Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, \"also a box of matches and some sugar and crackers.   But don't forget the matches whatever you do.\"  \"I won't,\" promised the bunny uncle, and soon he was hopping along through the woods wondering what sort of an adventure he would have this day.  As he was going along keeping a sharp look-out for the bad fox, or the skillery-scalery alligator with the double jointed tail.  Uncle Wiggily heard a voice saying:  \"Oh, dear!  I'll never be able to get out from under the stone and grow tall as I ought.  I've pushed and pushed on it, but I can't raise it. Oh, dear; what a heavy stone!\"  \"Ha!  Some one under a stone!\" said Uncle Wiggily to himself.  \"That certainly is bad trouble.  I wonder if I cannot help?\"  The bunny uncle looked all around and down on the ground he saw a flat stone.  Underneath it something green and brown was peeping out.  \"Was that you who called?\" asked Mr. Longears.  \"It was,\" came the answer.  \"I am a Jack-in-the-Pulpit plant, you see, and I started to grow up, as all plants and flowers do when summer comes.  But when I had raised my head out of the earth I found a big stone over me, and now I can grow no more.  I've pushed and pushed until my back aches, and I can't lift the stone.\"  \"I'll do it for you,\" said Uncle Wiggily kindly, and he did, taking it off the Pulpit-Jack.  Then the Jack began growing up, and he had been held down so long that he grew quite quickly, so that even while Uncle Wiggily was watching, the Jack and his pulpit were almost regular size.  A Jack-in-the-Pulpit, you know, is a queer flower that grows in our woods.  Sometimes it is called an Indian turnip, but don't eat it, for it is very biting.  The Jack is a tall green chap, who stands in the middle of his pulpit, which is like a little pitcher, with a curved top to it.  A pulpit, you know, is where some one preaches on Sunday.  \"Thank you very much for lifting the stone off me so I could grow,\" said the Jack to Uncle Wiggily.  \"If ever I can do you a favor I will.\"  \"Oh, pray don't mention it,\" replied the rabbit gentleman, with a low bow.  \"It was a mere pleasure, I assure you.\"  Then the rabbit gentleman hopped on to the store, to get the matches, the crackers, the bread and other things for Nurse Jane.  \"And I must be sure not to forget the matches,\" Uncle Wiggily said to himself.  \"If I did Nurse Jane could not make a fire to cook supper.\"  There was an April shower while Uncle Wiggily was in the store, and he waited for the rain to stop falling before he started back to his hollow stump bungalow.  Then the sun came out very hot and strong and shone down through the wet leaves of the trees in the woods.  Along hopped the bunny uncle, and he was wondering what he would have for supper that night.  \"I hope it's something good,\" he said, \"to make up for not having an adventure.\"  \"Don't you call that an adventure--lifting the stone off the Jack-in-the-Pulpit so he could grow?\" asked a bird, sitting up in a tree.  \"Well, that was a little adventure.\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"But I want one more exciting; a big one.\"  And he is going to have one in about a minute.  Just you wait and you'll hear all about it.  The sun was shining hotter and hotter, and Uncle Wiggily was thinking that it was about time to get out his extra-thin fur coat when, all of a sudden, he felt something very hot behind him.  \"Why, that sun is really burning!\" cried the bunny.  Then he heard a little ant boy, who was crawling on the ground, cry out:  \"Fire!  Fire!  Fire!  Uncle Wiggily's bundle of groceries is on fire! Fire!  Fire!\"  \"Oh, my!\" cried the bunny uncle, as he felt hotter and hotter, \"The sun must have set fire to the box of matches.  Oh, what shall I do?\"  He dropped his bundle of groceries, and looking around at them he saw, surely enough, the matches were on fire.  They were all blazing.  \"Call the fire department!  Get out the water bugs!\" cried the little ant boy.  \"Fire!  Water!  Water!  Fire!\"  \"That's what I want--water,\" cried the bunny uncle.  \"Oh, if I could find a spring of water.  I could put the blazing matches, save some of them, perhaps, and surely save the bread and crackers.  Oh, for some water!\"  Uncle Wiggily and the ant boy ran here and there in the woods looking for a spring of water.  But they could find none, and the bread and crackers were just beginning to burn when a voice cried:  \"Here is water, Uncle Wiggily!\"  \"Where?  Where?\" asked the rabbit gentleman, all excited like.  \"Where?\"  \"Inside my pulpit,\" was the answer, and Uncle Wiggily saw, not far away, the Jack-plant he had helped from under the stone.  \"When it rained a while ago, my pitcher-pulpit became filled with water,\" went on Jack.  \"If you will just tip me over, sideways, I'll splash the water on the blazing matches and put them out.\"  \"I'll do it!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, and he quickly did.  The pulpit held water as good as a milk pitcher could, and when the water splashed on the fire that fire gave one hiss, like a goose, and went out.  \"Oh, you certainly did me a favor, Mr. Pulpit-Jack,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Though the matches are burned, the bread and crackers are saved, and I can get more matches.\"  Which he did, so Nurse Jane could make a fire in the stove.  So you see Uncle Wiggily had an adventure after all, and quite an exciting one, too, and if the lemon drop doesn't fall on the stick of peppermint candy and make it sneeze when it goes to the moving pictures, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the violets.     STORY VI  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE VIOLETS  Down in the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow there was a great clattering of pots and pans.  Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman who lived in the bungalow, sat up in bed, having been awakened by the noise, and he said:  \"Well, I wonder what Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy is doing now?  She certainly is busy at something, and it can't be making the breakfast buckwheat cakes, either, for she has stopped baking them.\"  \"I say, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, what's going on down in your kitchen?\" called the rabbit gentleman out loud.  \"I'm washing,\" answered the muskrat lady.  \"Washing what; the dishes?\" the bunny uncle wanted to know.  \"If you wash them as hard as it sounds, there won't be any of them left for dinner, and I haven't had my breakfast yet.\"  \"No, I'm getting ready to wash the clothes, and I wish you'd come down and eat, so I can clear away the table things!\" called the muskrat lady.  \"Oh, dear!  Clothes-washing!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, making his pink nose twinkle in a funny way.  \"I don't like to be around the bungalow when that is being done.  I guess I'll get my breakfast and go for a walk. Clothes have to be washed, I suppose,\" went on the rabbit gentleman, \"and when Nurse Jane has been ill I have washed them myself, but I do not like it.  I'll go off in the woods.\"  And so, having had his breakfast of carrot pudding, with turnip sauce sprinkled over the top, Uncle Wiggily took his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch, and hopped along.  The woods were getting more and more beautiful every day as the weather grew warmer.  The leaves on the trees were larger, and here and there, down in the green moss, that was like a carpet on the ground, could be seen wild flowers growing up.  \"I wonder what sort of an adventure I will have today?\" thought the bunny uncle as he went on and on.  \"A nice one, I hope.\"  And, as he said this, Uncle Wiggily heard some voices speaking.  \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed a sad little voice, \"no one will ever see us here!  Of what use are we in the world?  We are so small that we cannot be noticed.  We are not brightly colored, like the red rose, and all that will happen to us will be that a cow will come along and eat us, or step on us with her big foot.\"  \"Hush!  You musn't talk that way,\" said another voice.  \"You were put here to grow, and do the best you know how.  Don't be finding fault.\"  \"I wonder who can be talking?\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"I must look around.\"  So he looked up in the air, but though he heard the leaves whispering he knew they had not spoken.  Then he looked to the right, to the left, in front and behind, but he saw no one.  Then he looked down, and right at his feet was a clump of blue violet flowers.  \"Did you speak?\" asked Uncle Wiggily of the violets.  \"Yes,\" answered one who had been finding fault.  \"I was telling my sisters and brothers that we are of no use in the world.  We just grow up here in the woods,"]]]
