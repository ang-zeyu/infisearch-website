Was it really three-quarters of a million?\"  \"Maybe it was more,\" suggested Jack.  \"If I were you, Peleg, I'd not carry so much around in my pockets,\" said Dale.  \"I ain't had a cent left to me!\" shouted the driver of the carryall. \"This is some of your jokes, an' I want you to stop it! Oh, dear, now the school's opened ag'in I suppose there won't be no rest fer nobuddy!\" And he heaved a mountainous sigh.  \"Oh, Peleg! Don't be angry with me!\" murmured Pepper, with a trace of tears in his voice. \"If you get angry I'll die!\"  \"You behave yourself, Pepper Ditmore, or I won't drive you to the Hall.\"  \"Peleg, don't you want me to drive?\" asked Andy, who was on the front seat. \"I'm a cracker-jack at driving.\"  \"Not much! Don't you tech them hosses!\" shouted the general utility man in alarm. \"That off hoss is a new one an' he's mighty skittish, I can tell you. This mornin' when I was hookin' him up he nigh kicked the leg off o' me!\"  \"Say, how are we going to get to the Hall?\" came in ugly tones from Reff Ritter. He, with six other boys, was standing beside the carryall.  \"Captain Putnam said he'd send down some carriages,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"There they come now,\" and he pointed to the turnouts.  \"Pshaw! I wanted to go in the carryall,\" grumbled Ritter.  \"So did I,\" added Gus Coulter.  \"Well, this is full, so you'll have to take the carriages,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"Everybody hold fast!\" he shouted, as he took up the reins.  \"We are off!\" shouted Pepper, gaily. \"Farewell to Cedarville and ho! for Putnam Hall!\"  \"Wish I had room, I'd turn a handspring for you,\" came from Andy, who was quite an acrobat.  \"Now don't you cut up any monkey-shines,\" pleaded the driver of the carryall. \"That new hoss won't stand for 'em.\"  \"All right, Peleg, I'll keep as quiet as a lamb without a tail.\"  \"Why is a lamb without a tail quiet?\" asked Fred Century, quickly.  \"Give it up, Fred. Why?\"  \"Because he has no tale to tell.\"  \"Wow!\"  \"What a joke!\"  \"Throw him out!\"  \"Give him some cotton to eat!\"  \"Say, do keep quiet!\" pleaded Peleg Snuggers, as the boys in the carryall commenced to push Fred from one seat to another. \"Want these hosses to ran away with you?\"  \"Better draw it mild,\" suggested Major Jack. \"We don't want any accident on the way to the Hall.\" He looked back at the crowd left on the dock. \"Has anybody seen Bert Field?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I saw him last week,\" answered a student named Paul Singleton. \"He'll be here to-morrow.\"  \"How about Emerald?\" asked Pepper.  \"Coming to-night,\" answered Andy. \"He went to Ireland this summer, and his brogue is worse than ever.\"  \"Never mind, Emerald is a good fellow,\" said Major Jack. \"His heart is as big as a barrel.\"  \"Say, but wasn't Reff Ritter mad!\" came from Dale.  \"Oh, he makes me tired,\" answered Pepper. \"After all that happened last term wouldn't you think he'd behave himself better?\"  \"It isn't in him to behave himself,\" answered Fred Century. \"He is a bully and always will be.\"  \"Well, he has got to keep his distance this term,\" said Major Jack, with a firm look on his face. \"I am not going to stand for what I have in the past.\"  \"Nor I,\" added Pepper. \"If he doesn't keep his distance he'll suffer for it.\"  The carryall was now leaving the little village of Cedarville. Soon it came out on a country road that ran in the direction of Putnam Hall.  It was an ideal day in early September, and the cadets returning to the school were in high spirits. One started to sing and the others joined in.  \"Hello, there goes the Pornell Academy stage!\" cried Pepper, presently.  \"And there are some fellows we know!\" returned Jack, as the turnout belonging to a rival school came closer. \"Roy Bock and Bat Sedley.\"  \"I'll bet they are sore over what happened last June,\" cried Pepper.  \"It was their own fault that they suffered,\" came from Andy.  \"Look out!\" sang out Dale, and dodged down in the carryall.  Spat! A half-decayed apple struck the side of the turnout. Spat! came one through the open window. Then the skin of a banana followed, landing in Jack's lap.  \"Stop that, Bock!\"  \"Don't throw things in here, Sedley!\"  \"Something to remember us by!\" shouted Roy Bock, the bully of Pornell Academy, and he threw another soft apple into the carryall. It landed on Pepper's arm, leaving quite a mess there.  \"All right, if that's your game!\" cried Pepper, and feeling in his pocket he brought forth an orange he had purchased on the boat. Taking careful aim, he let fly with all force. The orange landed fairly and squarely on Roy Bock's nose.  \"Ouch!\" roared Roy Bock, and clapped his hand to his nose, which began to bleed.  \"Here's something for you, Sedley!\" cried Andy, and sent a handful of peanut shells into the Pornell student's face.  \"I'll fix you fellows!\" roared Roy Bock in a rage, and catching up a heavy book that was on the seat beside him he started to throw the volume at Jack and Pepper.  But the volume slipped and went sailing in the air in another direction, catching poor Peleg Snuggers on the cheek. The driver of the carryall was so startled that he let go the reins and fell from his seat into the dust of the road.  As the reins dropped at their heels, one of the horses--the new one--threw up his head in sudden fright. Then he made a mad lunge forward, dragging his mate with him. The carryall gave a lurch and a bound that sent the occupants flying into each other's laps.  \"Stop the team!\" was the cry.  \"The horses are running away!\"     CHAPTER II  THE CADETS OF PUTNAM HALL   It was true, the team was running away. One of the horses was a spirited animal and he now had the bit in his teeth. The boys in the rear of the turnout looked back, to see Peleg Snuggers still lying in the highway. The stage belonging to Pornell Academy had turned down a side road.  \"Can't you stop them, Andy?\" asked Jack Ruddy.  \"I don't see how,\" was the answer from the youth on the front seat. \"I can't get hold of the lines.\"  \"We must stop 'em somehow!\" cried Fred Century. \"Otherwise we'll have a smash-up, sure!\"  \"Whoa! whoa!\" yelled half a dozen, but these cries only served to scare the team more, and away they shot along the country road, sending the carryall swaying from side to side.  \"Look! look!\" yelled Andy, suddenly. \"The regular road is shut off! They are repairing it!\"  The boys gazed ahead and saw that some wooden horses and planking had been placed across the highway. This side of the barrier some bars had been taken from a fence, so that those using the road might drive around, through an orchard belonging to a farmer named Darrison.  \"We are going to strike those planks!\" cried Dale Blackmore.  \"Maybe the team will try to jump them!\" came from Fred.  \"If they do, they'll smash the carryall sure!\" answered Pepper. \"Perhaps we had better drop out at the rear.\"  \"Look out!\" sang out somebody, and just then the carryall left the highway and turned into the orchard. Then came a scraping, as the top of the turnout hit the low-hanging branches of some apple trees.  \"Whoa! stop that wagon!\" yelled a man's voice, and Amos Darrison appeared from among the trees. He made a leap for the team, but they swerved to one side. Then came a crash, as one of the wheels caught in a stump. Over went the carryall, with the boys in it. Andy, quick to act, used his acrobatic abilities by leaping into the branches of a nearby tree. Then the farmer caught the team and stopped them.  \"Anybody hurt?\" was Pepper's question, as he crawled out of the wreck.  \"I'm all right,\" answered Fred.  \"I got a twisted ankle, that's all,\" came from Dale, as he limped out.  \"Look at Jack!\" cried several. \"He's hurt!\"  All looked and saw the young major of the school battalion lying flat on his back in the front of the carryall. He had a nasty cut on the temple and his eyes were closed.  \"He is dead!\" murmured Pepper, hoarsely.  \"Oh, don't say that!\" said Andy, in sudden terror. He had just dropped to the ground.  \"If he ain't dead he's putty badly hurted,\" said the farmer who owned the orchard.  Pepper caught his chum in his arms and brought him out and laid him on the grass.  \"He is still breathing!\" he cried. \"Get some water and we'll bathe his face. Maybe that will bring him around.\"  \"I'll get the water!\" exclaimed Dale, and ran towards a well located at the side of the orchard.  To those who have read the other volumes in this \"Putnam Hall Series,\" the lads already mentioned will need no special introduction. For the benefit of others, let me state that Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were close chums, living, when at home, in the western part of New York State. Jack was slightly the older of the two and was of rather a serious turn of mind. Pepper was full of fun, and on that account was frequently called \"The Imp.\"  As related in my first volume, entitled \"The Putnam Hall Cadets,\" the lads left home to become cadets at a new institution of learning located on Cayuga Lake. This new school was presided over by Captain Victor Putnam, a retired army officer, who had modeled his institution somewhat after the famous military academy at West Point. It was a large school, ideally located on the shore of the lake, and had attached to it a gymnasium, a boathouse, and several other buildings. On the lower floor of the main building were the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],["title","The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#2)"],["body","rooms, the mess-hall, and the offices, and upstairs were the dormitories.  Arriving at the school, Jack and Pepper soon made a host of friends, including the acrobatic Andy Snow; Dale Blackmore, who was a great football player; Paul Singleton, who was usually called \"Stuffer\" because of his constant desire to eat; Joseph Hogan, commonly addressed as \"Emerald\" because of his Irish blood, and Joe Nelson, who was one of the best scholars the school ever had. They also made some enemies, the greatest of them being Reff Ritter, the big bully, and Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton, his cronies.  Not long after the students learned how to drill and to march they were allowed to ballot for officers. A bitter contest was waged, which resulted in Jack being chosen major of the Hall battalion. A bully named Dan Baxter had wanted to be major, and he bribed Gus Coulter and some others to vote for him, but without avail. It may be added here that Baxter was now away on a vacation, but had written that he was going to return to the school before long.  During their first term at Putnam Hall the chums had several adventures, not the least of which was one in the woods, where they rescued George Strong, one of the teachers, from two of his relatives who were insane.  Mr. Strong's ancestry dated back to the Revolution, and he told the cadets about a family treasure buried in the vicinity of the lake. How the boys went in search of the treasure, and how they had numerous other adventures, was related in the second volume of this series, called \"The Putnam Hall Rivals.\"  With the coming of the next summer, the thoughts of the students turned to various sports, and in the third volume, \"The Putnam Hall Champions,\" I told how the chums entered several contests, both on land and on the lake, and won out. At that time Fred Century was a pupil at Pornell Academy, but Fred became so disgusted at the actions of Roy Bock, Bat Sedley, and some others, that he quit the rival institution of learning and came to Putnam Hall, where he was given a warm welcome.  The encounters that Jack and his chums had with Reff Ritter and his cronies were numerous, and more than once Ritter did his best to get the young major into serious trouble. Once he drugged Jack with some French headache powders, and when he was exposed Captain Putnam would have expelled him had not Jack very generously asked that he be given another chance. For this any ordinary youth would have been grateful, but gratitude did not appear to be a part of Reff Ritter's make-up, and he soon showed himself to be as mean as ever.  For some time matters ran along smoothly at Putnam Hall, but then came trouble of an entirely new kind. Once, during the absence of Captain Putnam and George Strong, the school was left in charge of two other teachers--Josiah Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle. Crabtree was dictatorial to a degree and Cuddle was a man of queer ideas, one being that boys ate entirely too much.  As told in the volume called \"The Putnam Rebellion,\" the two teachers sought to subdue the boys by starving them and locking them in their dormitories. They rebelled, left the school by stealth, and marched away, to camp in the woods. There the rebels split up, one party under Major Jack and the other under Ritter. At last Captain Putnam put in an appearance, and Major Jack explained matters. As a consequence, the cadets went back to the Hall, and then Josiah Crabtree and Pluxton were called on to explain. Crabtree was retained, after a stern lecture from the master of the school, but Cuddle was discharged.  It was Captain Putnam's custom to take his students out once or twice a year to what was called an encampment--the lads marching to some spot where they could pitch their tents and go in for a touch of real army life, with target shooting, sham battles, and the like. In the next volume of the series, called \"The Putnam Hall Encampment,\" I told how the cadets left the Hall and marched to a distant lake. Their camping outfit was sent ahead by wagons, but the wagons got lost, and were finally found in the possession of Roy Bock and some other students of Pornell, they having made off with them while the drivers were in a roadhouse obtaining refreshments. For this trick, Pepper and some of the others got after the Pornellites and made them prisoners in a cave, from which they could escape only by going out a back way, through some water and mud, and thorny bushes.  While they were playing a certain trick in Cedarville, Jack and Pepper fell in with a youth named Bert Field. He was a queer lad, but did the chums a good turn, and in return they promised to help him. He was trying to locate a certain old man who was defrauding him out of some property. The old man was discovered during a visit to a mysterious mill said to be haunted, and by the chums' aid Bert Field got what was coming to him. It was thought best to send Bert to school, and he said he wanted to go to Putnam Hall.  \"We'll be glad to have him with us,\" said Jack, and so it was settled.  Following the encampment had come the regular summer vacation, and the cadets had scattered far and wide, Jack and Pepper going for a cruise around the Great Lakes, and Andy and Dale going to Asbury Park and Atlantic City. Reff Ritter had started for a summer in the Adirondacks, but unexpected word from home, of which more will be said later, had caused him to give up the outing.     CHAPTER III  SOMETHING ABOUT A RUNAWAY   While Dale and Andy ran off to get the water, the other boys gathered around Jack. The young major still lay with his eyes closed, breathing faintly.  \"He got a bad crack on the head,\" remarked Fred Century.  \"He certainly did,\" whispered another cadet. \"If he doesn't come around what shall we do?\"  \"How did the team happen to run away?\" questioned Amos Darrison.  \"Some fellows from Pornell Academy threw things at us,\" explained Pepper. \"We'll have an account to settle with 'em for this,\" he added grimly.  \"Wonder how poor Snuggers made out?\"  \"Here he comes now,\" was the answer, and looking back toward the highway, the cadets saw the driver of the carryall approaching on a swift limp.  \"Did ye stop 'em?\" he gasped. \"Oh, dear, what a bust-up! But it wasn't my fault--you boys can prove that, can't ye?\"  \"We can, Peleg,\" answered Pepper. \"Much hurt?\"  \"I got a nasty twist to my back when I tumbled. Say, what's the matter with Major Ruddy?\" And the general utility man forgot his own pains as he gazed at the motionless form of Jack.  The cadets told him, and in the midst of the explanation Dale and Andy came back with a bucket of water and a tin dipper. The major's face was bathed, and a little water was put into his mouth, and with a gulp he opened his eyes and stared around him.  \"Oh, my head!\" he murmured. \"Who hit me?\"  \"You were in the carryall smash-up, Jack,\" answered Pepper. \"You got a bad one on the head.\"  \"Oh, yes, I remember now.\" Jack sat up and placed his hand to his forehead. \"Bloody, eh? Say, that was a crack, all right!\"  \"It's lucky you weren't killed,\" said Andy.  \"Better take it easy for a while,\" advised Dale. \"Maybe we had better get a doctor.\"  \"Oh, I guess I'll be all right after a bit, Dale,\" answered the young major, who had a horror of being placed on the sick list. \"The knocking around stunned me, that's all.\"  \"Let me tie a handkerchief over that cut,\" said Pepper.  \"Here, I've got some court-plaster,\" said Fred, producing a little package. \"Let us bind it up with that.\"  This was done, and after he had had a drink of water, Jack said he felt much better. But when he got up on his feet he was rather shaky in the knees.  \"I--I don't think I can walk to the Hall,\" he said, with a faint smile.  \"We'll get a carriage,\" answered Pepper. \"Maybe Mr. Darrison will let us have one. We'll pay for it, of course,\" he went on, knowing that the old farmer was a close person.  \"I'll let you have my three-seated carriage and a team, if you want them,\" answered Amos Darrison. \"But it will cost you two dollars. I can't afford to let you have 'em for nothing, because I'm a poor man, and taxes are heavy, and so many things wanted on the farm, and my wife wants----\"  \"Never mind, we'll pay the two dollars,\" interrupted Pepper. \"Everybody who rides can chip in,\" he added to the surrounding cadets.  While the lads were waiting for the farmer to hook up his horses, some of them and Peleg Snuggers examined the carryall. A wheel had come off, and the glass had been broken, but otherwise the turnout had suffered but little.  \"I am glad it is no worse,\" said Andy. \"I'd hate to see that old carryall put out of business. I've had so many nice rides in it.\"  \"The axle will have to be mended before we can use it again,\" announced Peleg Snuggers. \"We'll have to leave it here until the wheelwright can come fer it. I'll take the hosses back to the school.\"  \"Look out that they don't run away with you,\" warned Pepper.  \"Let me ride one of them!\" cried the acrobatic Andy. \"Give me the new one. I'll wager he won't get away from me.\"  \"You'll break your neck!\" answered the carryall driver.  \"Not at all. Peleg, let me do it. I'm used to horses!\" pleaded Andy.  Now, if the truth must be told, Peleg Snuggers did not relish taking the runaway team back to the school alone. He was a little afraid of the new horse, remembering how he had been kicked in the morning.  \"Well, if you want to go, I'll let ye!\" he said at last. \"But, remember, 'tain't my fault if ye come back killed.\"  \"Don't you worry; no horse will ever get the best of me,\" answered Andy.  A little later Amos Darrison brought out his three-seated carriage and all of the cadets but Andy got in. The baggage was left behind, the farmer promising to deliver it by wagon.  \"See you later,\" cried Pepper to Andy. \"Be careful!\"  \"Don't worry; we'll get there before you do,\" answered Andy.  Two blankets were arranged as saddles on the runaway team's backs and a few minutes later Andy and Peleg Snuggers"]]]
