They all, at any rate, seemed to agree perfectly; and at a certain moment she saw her husband and M. de Thaller strike each other’s hand, as people do who exchange a pledge.  Eleven o’clock struck.  M. Favoral was insisting to make his guests accept a cup of tea or a glass of punch; but M. de Thaller declared that he had some work to do, and that, his carriage having come, he must go.  And go he did, taking with him the baroness, followed by M. Saint Pavin and M. Jottras.  And when, the door having closed upon them, M. Favoral found himself alone with his wife,  “Well,” he exclaimed, swelling with gratified vanity, “what do you think of our friends?”  “They surprised me,” she answered.  He fairly jumped at that word.  “I should like to know why?”  Then, timidly, and with infinite precautions, she commenced explaining that M. de Thaller’s face inspired her with no confidence; that M. Jottras had seemed to her a very impudent personage; that M. Saint Pavin appeared low and vulgar; and that, finally, the young baroness had given her of herself the most singular idea.  M. Favoral refused to hear more.  “It’s because you have never seen people of the best society,” he exclaimed.  “Excuse me.  Formerly, during my mother’s life--”  “Eh!  Your mother never received but shop-keepers.”  The poor woman dropped her head.  “I beg of you, Vincent,” she insisted, “before doing any thing with these new friends, think well, consult--”  He burst out laughing.  “Are you not afraid that they will cheat me?” he said,--“people ten times as rich as we are.  Here, don’t let us speak of it any more, and let us go to bed.  You’ll see what this dinner will bring us, and whether I ever have reason to regret the money we have spent.”    VIII  When, on the morning after this dinner, which was to form an era in her life, Mme. Favoral woke up, her husband was already up, pencil in hand, and busy figuring.  The charm had vanished with the fumes of the champagne; and the clouds of the worst days were gathering upon his brow.  Noticing that his wife was looking at him,  “It’s expensive work,” he said in a bluff tone, “to set a business going; and it wouldn’t do to commence over again every day.”  To hear him speak, one would have thought that Mme. Favoral alone, by dint of hard begging, had persuaded him into that expense which he now seemed to regret so much.  She quietly called his attention to the fact, reminding him that, far from urging, she had endeavored to hold him back; repeating that she augured ill of that business over which he was so enthusiastic, and that, if he would believe her, he would not venture.  “Do you even know what the project is?” he interrupted rudely.  “You have not told me.”  “Very well, then: leave me in peace with your presentiments.  You dislike my friends; and I saw very well how you treated Mme. de Thaller.  But I am the master; and what I have decided shall be. Besides, I have signed.  Once for all, I forbid you ever speaking to me again on that subject.”  Whereupon, having dressed himself with much care, he started off, saying that he was expected at breakfast by Saint Pavin, the financial editor, and by M. Jottras, of the house of Jottras & Brother.  A shrewd woman would not have given it up so easy, and, in the end, would probably have mastered the despot, whose intellect was far from brilliant.  But Mme. Favoral was too proud to be shrewd; and besides, the springs of her will had been broken by the successive oppression of an odious stepmother and a brutal master.  Her abdication of all was complete.  Wounded, she kept the secret of her wound, hung her head, and said nothing.  She did not, therefore, venture a single allusion; and nearly a week elapsed, during which the names of her late guests were not once mentioned.  It was through a newspaper, which M. Favoral had forgotten in the parlor, that she learned that the Baron de Thaller had just founded a new stock company, the Mutual Credit Society, with a capital of several millions.  Below the advertisement, which was printed in enormous letters, came a long article, in which it was demonstrated that the new company was, at the same time, a patriotic undertaking and an institution of credit of the first class; that it supplied a great public want; that it would be of inestimable benefit to industry; that its profits were assured; and that to subscribe to its stock was simply to draw short bills upon fortune.  Already somewhat re-assured by the reading of this article, Mme. Favoral became quite so when she read the names of the board of directors.  Nearly all were titled, and decorated with many foreign orders; and the remainder were bankers, office-holders, and even some ex-ministers.  “I must have been mistaken,” she thought, yielding unconsciously to the influence of printed evidence.  And no objection occurred to her, when, a few days later, her husband told her,  “I have the situation I wanted.  I am head cashier of the company of which M. de Thaller is manager.”  That was all.  Of the nature of this society, of the advantages which it offered him, not one word.  Only by the way in which he expressed himself did Mme. Favoral judge that he must have been well treated; and he further confirmed her in that opinion by granting her, of his own accord, a few additional francs for the daily expenses of the house.  “We must,” he declared on this memorable occasion, “do honor to our social position, whatever it may cost.”  For the first time in his life, he seemed heedful of public opinion. He recommended his wife to be careful of her dress and of that of the children, and re-engaged a servant.  He expressed the wish of enlarging their circle of acquaintances, and inaugurated his Saturday dinners, to which came assiduously, M. and Mme. Desclavettes, M. Chapelain the attorney, the old man Desormeaux, and a few others.  As to himself he gradually settled down into those habits from which he was nevermore to depart, and the chronometric regularity of which had secured him the nickname of Old Punctuality, of which he was proud.  In all other respects never did a man, to such a degree, become so utterly indifferent to his wife and children.  His house was for him but a mere hotel, where he slept, and took his evening meal.  He never thought of questioning his wife as to the use of her time, and what she did in his absence.  Provided she did not ask him for money, and was there when he came home, he was satisfied.  Many women, at Mme. Favoral’s age, might have made a strange use of that insulting indifference and of that absolute freedom.  If she did avail herself of it, it was solely to follow one of those inspirations which can only spring in a mother’s heart.  The increase in the budget of the household was relatively large, but so nicely calculated, that she had not one cent more that she could call her own.  With the most intense sorrow, she thought that her children might have to endure the humiliating privations which had made her own life wretched.  They were too young yet to suffer from the paternal parsimony; but they would grow; their desires would develop; and it would be impossible for her to grant them the most innocent satisfactions.  Whilst turning over and over in her mind this distressing thought, she remembered a friend of her mother’s, who kept, in the Rue St. Denis, a large establishment for the sale of hosiery and woollen goods.  There, perhaps, lay the solution of the problem.  She called to see the worthy woman, and, without even needing to confess the whole truth to her, she obtained sundry pieces of work, ill paid as a matter of course, but which, by dint of close application, might be made to yield from eight to twelve francs a week.  From this time she never lost a minute, concealing her work as if it were an evil act.  She knew her husband well enough to feel certain that he would break out, and swear that he spent money enough to enable his wife to live without being reduced to making a work woman of herself.  But what joy, the day when she hid way down at the bottom of a drawer the first twenty-franc-piece she had earned, a beautiful gold-piece, which belonged to her without contest, and which she might spend as she pleased, without having to render any account to any one!  And with what pride, from week to week, she saw her little treasure swell, despite the drafts she made upon it, sometimes to buy a toy for Maxence, sometimes to add a few ribbons or trinkets to Gilberte’s toilet!  This was the happiest time of her life, a halt in that painful journey through which she had been dragging herself for so many years.  Between her two children, the hours flew light and rapid as so many seconds.  If all the hopes of the young girl and of the woman had withered before they had blossomed, the mother’s joys at least should not fail her.  Because, whilst the present sufficed to her modest ambition, the future had ceased to cause her any uneasiness.  No reference had ever been made, between herself and her husband, to that famous dinner-party: he never spoke to her of the Mutual Credit Society; but now and then he allowed some words or exclamations to escape, which she carefully recorded, and which betrayed a prosperous state of affairs.  “That Thaller is a tough fellow!” he would exclaim, “and he has the most infernal luck!”  And at other times,  “Two or three more operations like the one we have just successfully wound up, and we can shut up shop!”  From all this, what could she conclude, if not that he was marching with rapid strides towards that fortune, the object of all his ambition?  Already in the neighborhood he had that reputation to be very rich, which is the beginning of riches itself.  He was admired for keeping his house with such rigid economy; for a man is always esteemed who has "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1748"],["title","Other People's Money (#8)"],["body","money, and does not spend it.  “He is not the man ever to squander what he has,” the neighbors repeated.  The persons whom he received on Saturdays believed him more than comfortably off.  When M. Desclavettes and M. Chapelain had complained to their hearts’ contents, the one of the shop, the other of his office, they never failed to add,  “You laugh at us, because you are engaged in large operations, where people make as much money as they like.”  They seemed to hold his financial capacities in high estimation. They consulted him, and followed his advice.  M. Desormeaux was wont to say,  “Oh! he knows what he is about.”  And Mme. Favoral tried to persuade herself, that, in this respect at least, her husband was a remarkable man.  She attributed his silence and his distractions to the grave cares that filled his mind. In the same manner that he had once announced to her that they had enough to live on, she expected him, some fine morning, to tell her that he was a millionaire.    IX  But the respite granted by fate to Mme. Favoral was drawing to an end: her trials were about to return more poignant than ever, occasioned, this time, by her children, hitherto her whole happiness and her only consolation.  Maxence was nearly twelve.  He was a good little fellow, intelligent, studious at times, but thoughtless in the extreme, and of a turbulence which nothing could tame.  At the Massin School, where he had been sent, he made his teachers’ hair turn white; and not a week went by that he did not signalize himself by some fresh misdeed.  A father like any other would have paid but slight attention to the pranks of a schoolboy, who, after all, ranked among the first of his class, and of whom the teachers themselves, whilst complaining, said,  “Bash!  What matters it, since the heart is sound and the mind sane?”  But M. Favoral took every thing tragically.  If Maxence was kept in, or otherwise punished, he pretended that it reflected upon himself, and that his son was disgracing him.  If a report came home with this remark, “execrable conduct,” he fell into the most violent passion, and seemed to lose all control of himself.  “At your age,” he would shout to the terrified boy, “I was working in a factory, and earning my livelihood.  Do you suppose that I will not tire of making sacrifices to procure you the advantages of an education which I lacked myself?  Beware.  Havre is not far off; and cabin-boys are always in demand there.”  If, at least, he had confined himself to these admonitions, which, by their very exaggeration, failed in their object!  But he favored mechanical appliances as a necessary means of sufficiently impressing reprimands upon the minds of young people; and therefore, seizing his cane, he would beat poor Maxence most unmercifully, the more so that the boy, filled with pride, would have allowed himself to be chopped to pieces rather than utter a cry, or shed a tear.  The first time that Mme. Favoral saw her son struck, she was seized with one of those wild fits of anger which do not reason, and never forgive.  To be beaten herself would have seemed to her less atrocious, less humiliating.  Hitherto she had found it impossible to love a husband such as hers: henceforth, she took him in utter aversion: he inspired her with horror.  She looked upon her son as a martyr for whom she could hardly ever do enough.  And so, after these harrowing scenes, she would press him to her heart in the most passionate embrace; she would cover with her kisses the traces of the blows; and she would strive, by the most delirious caresses, to make him forget the paternal brutalities.  With him she sobbed.  Like him, she would shake her clinched fists in the vacant space; exclaiming, “Coward, tyrant, assassin!”  The little Gilberte mingled her tears with theirs; and, pressed against each other, they deplored their destiny, cursing the common enemy, the head of the family.  Thus did Maxence spend his boyhood between equally fatal exaggerations, between the revolting brutalities of his father, and the dangerous caresses of his mother; the one depriving him of every thing, the other refusing him nothing.  For Mme. Favoral had now found a use for her humble savings.  If the idea had never come to the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society to put a few sous in his son’s pocket, the too weak mother would have suggested to him the want of money in order to have the pleasure of gratifying it.  She who had suffered so many humiliations in her life, she could not bear the idea of her son having his pride wounded, and being unable to indulge in those little trifling expenses which are the vanity of schoolboys.  “Here, take this,” she would tell him on holidays, slipping a few francs into his hands.  Unfortunately, to her present she joined the recommendation not to allow his father to know any thing about it; forgetting that she was thus training Maxence to dissimulate, warping his natural sense of right, and perverting his instincts.  No, she gave; and, to repair the gaps thus made in her treasure, she worked to the point of ruining her sight, with such eager zeal, that the worthy shop-keeper of the Rue St. Denis asked her if she did not employ working girls.  In truth, the only help she received was from Gilberte, who, at the age of eight, already knew how to make herself useful.  And this is not all.  For this son, in anticipation of growing expenses, she stooped to expedients which formerly would have seemed to her unworthy and disgraceful.  She robbed the household, cheating on her own marketing.  She went so far as to confide to her servant, and to make of the girl the accomplice of her operations.  She applied all her ingenuity to serve to M. Favoral dinners in which the excellence of the dressing concealed the want of solid substance. And on Sunday, when she rendered her weekly accounts, it was without a blush that she increased by a few centimes the price of each object, rejoicing when she had thus scraped a dozen francs, and finding, to justify herself to her own eyes, those sophisms which passion never lacks.  At first Maxence was too young to wonder from what sources his mother drew the money she lavished upon his schoolboy fancies.  She recommended him to hide from his father: he did so, and thought it perfectly natural.  As he grew older, he learned to discern.  The moment came when he opened his eyes upon the system under which the paternal household was managed.  He noticed there that anxious economy which seems to betray want, and the acrimonious discussions which arose upon the inconsiderate use of a twenty-franc-piece.  He saw his mother realize miracles of industry to conceal the shabbiness of her toilets, and resort to the most skillful diplomacy when she wished to purchase a dress for Gilberte.  And, despite all this, he had at his disposition as much money as those of his comrades whose parents had the reputation to be the most opulent and the most generous.  Anxious, he questioned his mother.  “Eh, what does it matter?” she answered, blushing and confused.  “Is that any thing to worry you?”  And, as he insisted,  “Go ahead,” she said: “we are rich enough.”  But he could hardly believe her, accustomed as he was to hear every one talk of poverty; and, as he fixed upon her his great astonished eyes,  “Yes,” she resumed, with an imprudence which fatally was to bear its fruits, “we are rich; and, if we live as you see, it is because it suits your father, who wishes to amass a still greater fortune.”  This was hardly an answer; and yet Maxence asked no further question. But he inquired here and there, with that patient shrewdness of young people possessed with a fixed idea.  Already, at this time, M. Favoral had in the neighborhood, and ever among his friends, the reputation to be worth at least a million. The Mutual Credit Society had considerably developed itself: he must, they thought, have benefitted largely by the circumstance; and the profits must have swelled rapidly in the hands of so able a man, and one so noted for his rigid economy.  Such is the substance of what Maxence heard; and people did not fail to add ironically, that he need not rely upon the paternal fortune to amuse himself.  M. Desormeaux himself, whom he had “pumped” rather cleverly, had told him, whilst patting him amicably on the shoulder,  “If you ever need money for your frolics, young man, try and earn it; for I’ll be hanged if it’s the old man who’ll ever supply it.”  Such answers complicated, instead of explaining, the problem which occupied Maxence.  He observed, he watched; and at last he acquired the certainty that the money he spent was the fruit of the joint labor of his mother and sister.  “Ah! why not have told me so?” he exclaimed, throwing his arms around his mother’s neck.  “Why have exposed me to the bitter regrets which I feel at this moment?”  By this sole word the poor woman found herself amply repaid.  She admired the _noblesse_ of her son’s feelings and the kindness of his heart.  “Do you not understand,” she told him, shedding tears of joy, “do you not see, that the labor which can promote her son’s pleasure is a happiness for his mother?”  But he was dismayed at his discovery.  “No matter!” he said.  “I swear that I shall no longer scatter to the winds, as I have been doing, the money that you give me.”  For a few weeks, indeed, he was faithful to his pledge.  But at fifteen resolutions are not very stanch.  The impressions he had felt wore off.  He became tired of the small privations which he had to impose upon himself.  He soon came to take to the letter what his mother had told him, and to prove to his own satisfaction that to deprive himself of a pleasure was to deprive her.  He asked for ten francs one day, then ten francs another, and gradually resumed his old habits.  He was at this time about leaving school.  “The moment has come,” said M. Favoral, “for him to select a career, and support himself.”    X  To"]]]
