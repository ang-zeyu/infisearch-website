The purpose of the regulating button is to throw the point of the jack out of the nose of the hammer butt, and allow the hammer to rebound from the string. If the button is too high, it does not throw or trip the jack in time to prevent blocking. When the button is too low, it disengages too soon, and much of the force of the key is lost before it reaches the hammer.  _BR_, is the block rail, felted on the side next to the jack which strikes against it when thrown from nose. This rail is absent in some actions, in which case the back of the jack is felted and strikes against the \"back catch,\" which is also felted on inner side. (The back catch has no mark in the cut, but is explained below in connection with the \"back check.\")  _BC_, is the back check which is simply a piece of wood with a thick piece of felt glued to the inner face and suspended on a wire.  _BCW_, back check wire supporting the back check, and screwed to the wippen. The purpose of the back check is to check the hammer by coming in contact with the \"back catch\" (the backward projection of the butt), at a short distance from the string in its return, and prevent the hammer from falling entirely back to its rest position, thereby preventing quick repetition.  _Bl_, bridle. This is a piece of tape about an eighth of an inch wide with a piece of leather glued to the end and a hole near the end for the point of the \"stirrup\" or bridle wire. The cut shows where the bridle is fastened in the hammer butt by being put into the hole in the butt, and the back catch stem covered with glue and driven in by it which precludes all possibility of its coming loose. The bridle passes through a hole in the lower part of the back catch. Its purpose is to assist the hammer to return quickly by hanging to it with the weight of the wippen, extension, jack, etc., when the key is released. Thus the bridle becomes the main factor in the matter of quick repetition.  _Bl W_, bridle wire, screwed into wippen, bent in the shape of a buckle at top to hold bridle.  _Bt_, butt; or, more specifically, hammer butt. In some cheap actions the butt is joined to its flange _g_, by the means described under the head of wippen flange; but in this action the center-pin is held firmly in the butt by a small strip of brass containing a set screw; somewhat obscure in the cut, but discernible. As explained elsewhere, all center-pins turn in the flange and not in the middle part.  _HS_, hammer shank in rest position.  _H_, hammer showing wood body or head, and covering of two layers of felt.  _H R_, hammer rail, resting on felt cushion, _c_, glued to rail or bracket. The hammer rail is held in position by the rod, shown under the hammer shank, which is hinged to the bracket at the lower end, and which allows it to be moved forward when the soft pedal is used. The soft pedal communicates with this rail by a rod which moves it forward and thereby shortens the stroke of the hammers and produces a softer tone.  _sr_, spring rail screwed to the brackets. This rail supports the light wire springs which assist the hammers in returning to rest position.  _S_, string.  _D_, is the damper head secured to the damper wire by a set screw.  _DL_, damper lever, working in damper flange _g_, which is screwed to main rail.  _s_, spoon; so called from its shape. It is screwed into the wippen. When the key is struck, the motion on the wippen throws the spoon forward, pushing the lower end of damper lever forward, and releasing the damper from its contact with the string. The damper is held against the string by the wire spring which is seen running from the damper flange to the top of the damper lever.  _DR_, damper rod. This is a rod running from the left or bass end of the action to the right as far as the dampers are continued in the treble. It is acted upon by the \"loud\" or damper pedal, which raises the outer projection, and by being hinged to the main rail about the same height as this projection, the entire rod is thrown outward against the lower ends of the damper levers, releasing all the dampers simultaneously. This being the only office of the right pedal, it is readily seen that this pedal does not increase the loudness, but simply _sustains_ any number of tones struck successively, giving the effect of more volume.  The student should familiarize himself with all technical terms used in this lesson, as they will be referred to frequently in the succeeding lessons on repairing and regulating.   QUESTIONS ON LESSON III.  Without reference to anything but the cut, give technical names for parts of action represented by the following letters or abbreviations:      1. Bnc R, c, G P, BP, Ky, L.      2. Bm, Cpn, E, W, j, js, g, and M R.      3. Rr, B C, B R, B C W, Bl, and Bl W.      4. Bt, H, H S, H R, and sr.      5. S, D, D L, D R, s, B, and B B.      6.

What is the purpose of the back catch and back check?      10. Explain the mechanical action of the damper pedal, and its     effect when used; also, that of the soft pedal.     LESSON IV.  ~ACTION OF SQUARE AND GRAND PIANOS.~   ACTION OF THE SQUARE PIANO.  Up to about the year 1870, the square was the popular piano. The grand has always been too expensive for the great music-loving masses, and previous to this time the upright had not been developed sufficiently to assert itself as a satisfactory instrument. The numerous objections to the square piano forced its manufacture to be discontinued a few years after the introduction of the improved new upright. Square pianos that come, at the present day, under the hand of the tuner, are usually at least fifteen years old, and more frequently twenty or more. However, in some localities the tuner will meet numbers of these pianos and he will find them a great source of revenue, as they are almost invariably in need of repair.  Compare the three cuts of actions in the study of this lesson.  The main constituent parts of the square action are similar in appearance to those of the upright; in fact, most of the parts are the same in name and office. However, the parts are necessarily assembled very differently. In the square action, the hammers strike in a vertical direction, while in the upright they strike in a horizontal direction; the motion of the key being the same in both.  Of the three types, the square is the simplest action, as many of the parts seen in the upright and grand are entirely absent in the square.  Beginning with the key, it has its balance pin, guide pin, cushions, etc., practically the same as in the other types.  The bottom, or key rocker, is reversed in the square; the end transmitting the motion being nearest the performer.  The extension and wippen are absent in the square, as the jack is attached directly to the bottom or key-rocker.  The back check is screwed to the key, and as the hammer head rests against it after striking, the use of the contrivance called the back catch in the upright is unnecessary.

THE TRAP ACTION       consists of Pedals, Pedal Braces, Pedal Feet, Pedal Rods, Roller      Boards or Elbows, Studs, Plugs, Trap Springs, Wires and Lifter      Rods.       The cut is from the French action. Nearly all square pianos in      use at the present time are of this type.  The hammer rail in the square, in addition to serving its purpose as a rest for the hammers, also serves the purpose of the regulating rail, as you will see the regulating screw, with its button, attached to it. This rail is stationary in the square, not moving toward the strings and shortening the stroke as it does in the upright when the soft pedal is used. The soft pedal in the square piano simply interposes a piece of felt between each hammer and its corresponding string or strings. This felt being much softer than that of the hammers, the tone is greatly subdued.  The mechanical arrangement of the dampers is very different in the square from that in the upright. The dampers are above the strings. Instead of springs to hold them against the strings, they simply rest upon them with their weight. In many old squares some of the dampers fall upon nodal points, causing defective damping or harmonic after-tones.  The stationary parts of the square action are: action frame, to which is secured the balance rail, balance pins and guide pins, hammer rail, flange rail, and damper rail. When the key is struck, the parts that move upward are: the back end of the key, bottom, jack, hammer, back check,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],["title","Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#4)"],["body","wire and damper lever. The hammer falls back upon the back check immediately after striking, and remains there until the key is released, when all movable parts fall to rest position.  The action of the jack is the same in all types.   ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.  After thoroughly going over the details of the action of the square and upright pianos, there remains very little to describe in the action of the grand.  The grand action partakes of the characteristics of both the upright and the square, and is somewhat more complicated than either.  The bottom and extension are almost identical with those of the upright; the extension, however, is necessarily very short.  The wippen is of different construction, and somewhat more complicated in the grand.  The flange rail in the grand is made also to serve the purpose of regulating rail, as the hammer rail is made to do in the square.  The back check is identical with that of the square.  The dampers are the same in their working principles as those of the square, but are generally different in construction; yet, some squares have the same arrangement of dampers as those shown in the cut of the grand action.  The soft pedal of the grand shifts the entire action to the right so that the hammers strike only two and in some cases only one of the strings.  The student should study the three types of actions from the actions themselves, if possible.  [Illustration: ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.]       ACTION OF THE GRAND PIANO.      1.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REMOVING THE SQUARE AND GRAND ACTIONS.  First, feel or look underneath the keyboard and see if there are screws that go up into the action. In most of the better grade instruments the action is fastened in this way. If the screws have square heads, your tuning hammer will fit them and bring them out; if common screws, a screw-driver will suffice. Look through the opening in the sound board where the hammers strike and see that they are all down before pulling out the action, lest they break off by catching on the under side of the sound board. This is almost sure to happen if actions are out of order.  In most square pianos, the narrow board just below the keys can be removed by being raised straight up, as it simply sets over screw heads in the key frame. When this strip is removed, a wire handle will be found in the middle of the key frame by which to draw out the action. In some cases, and especially in grands, this strip is secured by screws found underneath the piano. In other pianos, the action is held by screws in front of the key frame, which will be revealed by the removal of the front strip, above referred to.  Be especially careful in placing the action back into the piano. As a rule, it is safe to keep the right (long) end of the square action bearing against the right side of entrance, being sure that one end of action does not get ahead, which might cause some of the hammers to strike the props for which the openings are left in the back extremities of action.  While the action is out, study carefully the purpose of every part and its movements, referring to this and the previous lesson until you have thoroughly mastered the entire mechanism. Do not rest until you can name correctly everything you see and know its use so well that you could explain it satisfactorily to an inquirer. Sometimes the tuner is asked a great many perplexing questions and is expected to respond intelligently.  We have dealt with the three types of actions that are most commonly found in the three types of pianos. The student must bear in mind that there are numerous manufacturers of actions, and that each has his peculiar method of constructing his special action to bring about the desired results, which are practically the same in all cases; and consequently, while a variety of construction will confront the beginner in piano regulating and repairing, he will understand the construction and requirements of any action that may demand his skill from the foregoing instruction, if properly mastered. In this, as in all other mechanical professions, one's inventive genius must often be summoned to assist in surmounting obstacles which are sure to arise unexpectedly.   QUESTIONS ON LESSON IV.      1. From a philosophical point of view, which do you consider the     easiest and most perfect of the three types of actions? Also give     reasons.      2. Considering the wippen and its attachments as one part, how     many parts move when a key is struck in the upright piano? How     many in the square?      3. Name the parts found in the upright action that are absent in     the square.      4. Describe the three methods by which soft tone is obtained from     use of soft pedal in the three types of actions.      5. What rail serves two purposes in the square action, and what     are they? What rail serves two purposes in the grand action, and     what are they?     LESSON V.  ~REGULATING AND REPAIRING.~  FAULTS IN PIANOS, ASIDE FROM THE ACTION, AND THEIR REMEDIES.   One of the most common, and, at the same time, most annoying conditions both to the owner of the piano and the tuner, is the \"sympathetic rattle.\" This trouble is most usual in the square and the grand pianos and is generally due to some loose substance lying on the sound board. The rattle will be apparent only when certain keys are struck, other tones being perfectly free from it. These tones cause the sound board to vibrate in sympathy, so to speak, with the weight of the intruding substance at the point where it lies, and if it be moved the distance of six inches it will sometimes cease to respond to these particular tones, but may respond to others, or cease to cause any trouble.  The article may generally be found near the front of the sound board under the top piece of the case, this being the place where it would most likely fall. No special instrument is made for the purpose of searching for such objects, but one can be easily devised with which the tuner can feel all over the sound board, and remove such articles as well as dust and dirt. Secure a piece of rattan or good pliable hickory, and draw it down to the width of half an inch, thin enough to bend easily, and long enough to reach anywhere under the stringing or metal plate. By putting a cloth over this stick you can remove anything that comes in its way. Some difficulty will be found, however, in getting under the plate in some pianos. In case you cannot procure a suitable piece of wood, a piece of clock spring will be found to answer very well. We have taken from pianos such articles as pencils, pieces of candy, dolls, pointers used by music teachers, tacks, nails, pennies, buttons, pieces of broken lamp chimneys, etc., etc., any one of which is sufficient to render the piano unfit for use. The sound board of the upright being vertical prevents its being subject to the above difficulty.  A split in the sound board, in any style of piano, sometimes causes trouble due to the vibrating edges of the board coming in contact with each other. Insert the point of your screwdriver in the crack, holding it there firmly; if the rattling stops, the difficulty is discovered, and may be remedied by placing a screw or wedge in the crack, or a wedge of wood, cork or rubber between the sound board and iron plate or casing, if the location of the trouble permits. While this method seems a perfunctory one, it is nevertheless the best the tuner is prepared to do, for it is next to impossible to glue a crack in the sound board successfully outside of a regular factory or repair shop, where the instrument may be taken all apart and a new sound board put in or the old one properly repaired.  Sometimes the sound board gets loose or unglued at the edges, or the bridges or ribs come loose. Any part of the piano where there is vibration or loose material may become the source of the sympathetic rattle, as even parts of the case vibrate with the tones struck; so you must examine the panels, lock, hinges, soft pedal bar (in square), in fact all parts of the case and woodwork for the location of the trouble. Once found, the remedy will suggest itself. The greatest difficulty is to locate the cause. Very frequently this will be found entirely outside of the piano; a loose window glass, picture glass, lamp or other article of furniture in the room may respond to a particular tone or its octave. We have never found the sympathetic rattle in the action; it has rattles, but not of this character. Any other defect which may be found under this head will only require the exercise of a little mechanical ingenuity to suggest a remedy.   REGULATING AND REPAIRING THE UPRIGHT ACTION.  (Use cut of upright action for reference in following study.)  We will begin with the key and take up each part of the action in the succession in which motion is transmitted.  1. _Key_.--Keys stick; that is, after being struck, they fail to come up quickly, if at all. First ascertain if the trouble is really in the key, or in the upper part of the action. To do this, lift the extension or wippen"]]]
