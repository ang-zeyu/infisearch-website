Is it not as perspicuous as the Sun, that it lies in your power to reform his Counsell, introduce your selves, make what composition you can desire, have all the security that mortall men can imagine, and the greatest Princes of Europe to engage in the performance? This were becoming worthy men, and honourable indeed; this ingenuous self-denyall: And it is no disgrace to reforme a mistake, but to persist in it lyes the shame. The whole Nation require it of you, and the lawes of God command it, you cannot, you must not deferr it. For what can you pretend that will not then drop into your bosomes? The humble man will have repose, the aspiring and ambitious, honours: The Merchant will be secure, Trades immediately recover, Aliances will be confirm'd, the Lawes reflourish, tender Consciences consider'd, present purchasers satisfied; the Souldier payed, maintained and provided for; and what's above all this, Christianity and Charity will revive again amongst us, _Mercy and Truth will meet together; righteousness and peace shall kiss each other_.  But let us now consider on the other side, the confusion, which must of necessity light upon us if we persist in our rebellion and obstinacy; We are already impoverisht, and consum'd with war and the miseries that attend it; you have wasted our treasure, and destroyed the Woods, spoyled the Trade, and shaken our properties; a universall animosity is in the very bowells of the Nation; the Parent against the Children, and the Children against the Parents, betraying one another to the death; in summe, if that have any truth which our B. _Saviour_ has himself pronounced, _That a Kingdome divided cannot stand_, it is impossible we should subsist in the condition we are reduc'd to. Consider we again, how ridiculous our late proceedings have made us to our neighbours round about us. Their _Ministers_ laugh at our extream{4} giddinesse, and we seem to mock at their addresses: for no sooner do their _Credentialls_ arrive, but behold the scean is changed, and the Government is fled, he that now acted King, left a fool in his place, and they stand amazed at out _Buffoonery_ and madnesse.  What then may we imagine will be the product of all these disadvantages, when the Nations that deride and hate us, shall be united for our destruction; and that the harvest is ripe for the sickle of their fury? shall we not certainly be a prey to an inevitable ruine, having thus weakned our selves by a brutish civill war, and cut off those glorious _Heros_, the wise and the valiant, whose courage in such a calamity we shall in vain imploar, that would bravely have sacrificed themselves for our delivery? Let us remember how often we have served a forraign people, and that there is nothing so confident, but a provoked God can overthrow.  For my part, I tremble, but to consider what may be the issue of these things, when our iniquities are full, and that God shall make inquisition for the bloud that has been spilt; unlesse we suddainly meet him by an unfained repentance, and turn from all the abominations by which we have provoaked him; And then, it is to be hoped, that he who would have compounded with the _Father of the faithfull_, had there been but ten Righteous men in _Sodom_; and that spared _Nineveh_ that populous and great City; will yet have mercy on us, hearken to the prayers, and have regard to the teares, of so many Millions of people, who day and night do interceed with him: The _Priests_ and Ministers _of the Lord weeping between the porch and the Altar, and saying, Spare thy people O Lord, spare thy People, and give not thine Inheritance to reproach_.  And now I have said what was upon my Spirit for your sake, when, for the satisfaction of such as (through its effect upon your soule) this Addresse of mine may possibly come to, I have religiously declared, that the Person who writ it, had no unworthy or sinister design of his owne to gratifie, much lesse any other party whatever; as being neither _Courtier_, _Souldier_, or _Church-man_, but a plain Country Gentleman, engag'd on neither side, who, has had leisure, (through the goodnesse of God) candidly, and without passion to examine the particulars which he has touched, and expects no other reward in the successe of it, then what _Christ_ has promised in the _Gospels_: The _Benediction{5} of the peace maker_; and which he already feels in the discharge of his Conscience being for his own particular, long since resolv'd with himself, to persist in his Religion, and his loyalty to the death; come what will; as wrongfully perswaded, that all the persecutions, losses, and other accidents which may arrive him for it here, _are not worthy to be compared to that eternall{6} weight of glory which is to be revealed hereafter_; and to the inexpressible consolation, which it will afford on his _Death-bed_, when all these guilded pleasures will disappear, this noise, and empty pompe, when God shall _set all out sins in order before us_; and when, it is certain, that the humble, and the peaceable, the charitable and the meek shall not loose their reward, not change their hopes, for all the Crownes and the Scepters, the Lawrells and the Trophies which ambitious and self seeking men contend for, with so much Tyrannie and injustice.  Let them therefore no longer deceive you, dear Sr. and as the guise of these vile men is, tell you they are the Godly-party, under which for the present they would pass, and _courage themselves in their wickedness_, stoping their ears, and shutting their eyes against all that has been taught and practised by the best of Christians, & holiest of Saints these sixteen hundred years: _You shall know them by their fruites, do men gather Grapes of Thornes, or Figs of Thistles?_ But so, being miserably gall'd with the remembrance of their impieties, and the steps by which they have ascended to those fearfull precepices, they seek to allay the secret pangs of a gnawing worme, by adopting the most prodigious of their crimes into a Religion fitted for the purpose, and versatile as their giddy interest, till at last, encourag'd by the number of thriving Proselytes and successes, they grow feared and confident; swallowing all with ease, and passing from one heresie to another; whilst yet they are still pursued, and shalt never be at repose: For Conscience will at last awake, and then how frightful, how deplorable, yea, how inexpressably sad will that day be unto them! _For these things have they done, and I held my tongue _(saith God)_ and they thought wickedly, that I am such a one as themselves; but I will reprove them and set before them the things that they have done. O consider this ye that forget God, least he pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you!_  And now _Sir_, you see the liberty which I have taken, and how farr I have adventured to testifie a friendship which I have ever professed for you: I have indeed been very bold; but it was greatly requisite; and you know that amongst all men there are none which more openly use the freedom of reprehension, then those who love most: Advices are not rejected by any, but such as determine to pursue their evill courses; and the language which I use, is not to offend, but to beseech you to return. I conjure you therefore to re-enter into your self, and not to suffer these mean and dishonourable respects, which are unworthy your nobler spirit, to prompt you to a course so deform'd, and altogether unworthy your education and Family. Behold your friends all deploaring your misfortunes, and your Enemies even pitie you; whilst to gratifie a few mean and desperate persons, you cancell your duty to your prince, and disband your Religion; dishonour your name, bring ruine and infamy on your posterity.  But when all this shall fail (as God forbid a title of it should) _I_ have yet this hope remaining; that when you have been sufficiently fated with this wicked course, wandred from place to place, government to government, sect to sect, in so universal a deluge, and find no repose for the sole of your foot (as it is certain you never shal) you with at last with the peaceful _Dove_, return to the Arke from whence you fled, to your first principles, and to sober counsels; or with the repenting _Prodigall_ in the Gospel, to _your Father_ which is in heaven, and to the _Father of your Countrey_: For in so doing, you shall not only rejoyce your servant, and all good men, but the very _Angels_ which are in heaven, and who are never said to rejoyce indeed, but _at the Conversion of a sinner_.  _This 27. Octob. 1659_  _Et tu conversus, converte Fratres._   PSAL. 37.  _10. Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone, thou shalt look after his place, and he shall be away._  _36.

A PANEGYRIC TO CHARLES the II. PRESENTED TO HIS MAJESTY On the Day of His INAUGURATION, _April 23._ MDCLXI.   I have decreed with myself (O best and greatest of Kings!) to publish the just resentiments of a heart, perfectly touch'd with the Joy and Universal Acclamations of your People, for your this dayes Exaltation and glorious investiture. And truly, it was of custome us'd to good and gracious Princes, upon lesser occasions, to pronounce and celebrate their merits with Elogies and Panegyrics; but if ever they were due, it is to your Majesty this Day; because as your Virtues are superiour to all that pass'd before you; so is the Conjuncture, and the steps by which you are happily ascended to it, Miraculous, and alltogether stupendious: So that what the former Ages might produce to deprecate their fears, or flatter the Inclinations of a Tyrant, we offer spontaneously, and by Instinct, without Artifice to your Serene Majesty, our just and rightfull Soveraign. And if in these expressions of it, and the formes we use, it were possible to exceed, and so offend your Modesty; herein only (great Sir) do we not fear to disobey you; since it is not in your power to deny us our rejoycing, nor indeed in ours, to moderate. Permit us therefore (O best of Kings) to follow our genius, and to consecrate your Name, and this dayes exaltation to that posterity which you alone have preserved, and which had certainly seen its period, but for your happy Restauration; so that your Majesty does not so much accept a benefit from, as give it to your Subjects. For though the fulness of this Dayes joy, be like the seven years of plenty; yet, is that bread far more sweet, which is eaten with remembrance of the past Famine (too bitter, alas! to be forgotten on the suddain) especially, when it may serve to illustrate our present felicity, and conduce to your Majesties glory: For so the skillful Artist, studious of making a surprising peice, or representing some irradiated Deity, deepens the shadowes sometimes with the darkest touches, and approaching to horrour it self, thereby to render his lights the more refulgent, and striking in the eyes of the Spectator.  Let us then call to mind (and yet for ever cursed be the memory of it) those dismal clouds, which lately orespread us, when we served the lusts of those immane Usurpers, greedy of power, that themselves might be under none; Cruel, that they might murther the Innocent without cause; Rich, with the publick poverty; strong, by putting the sword into the hands of furies, and prosperous by unheard of perfidie. Armies, Battails, Impeaching, Imprisonment, Arraining, Condemning, Proscribing, Plundring, Gibbets and Executions were the eloquent expressions of our miseries: There was no language then heard but of Perjury, Delusion, Hypocrisie{7}, Heresie, Taxes, Excises, Sequestration, Decimation, and a thousand like barbarities: In summe, the solitudes were filled with noble Exiles, the Cities with rapacious Theives, the Temples with Sacrilegious Villains; They had the spoiles of Provinces, the robbing of Churches, the goods of the slain, the Stock of Pupils, the plunder of Loyal Subjects; no Testament, no State secure, and nothing escaped their cruelty and insatiable avarice. For if it be sweet in prosperity, to consider of the past adventures, if tempests commend the Haven; War, Peace; and our last sharp sickness, our present Health and Vigour; why should it not delight your Majesty to hear of the miseries we have suffered; since they re-inforce your own felicity, and the benefits which we receive by it? where then should I begin but with thy Calamities, O unfortunate _England_! who hadst only the priviledge of being miserable, when all the World were happy: But I will not go too for in repeating the sorrowes which are vanish't, or uncover the buried memory of the evils past; least whilst we strive to represent the vices of others, we seem to contaminate your Sacred purple, or alloy our present rejoycing; since that only is sign of a perfect and consummate felicity, when even the very remembrance of evils past, is quite forgotten.  Miraculous Reverse! O marvel greater then Mans Counsel! who will believe that which his eyes do see? what before a twenty years confusion had destroy'd; behold a few moneths have restor'd: But the wonder does yet so much more astonish, that the grief was not so universal for having suffer'd under such a Tyranny, as for having been so long depriv'd of so excellent a Prince: No more then do we henceforth accuse our past miseries; All things are by your presence repair'd, and so reflourish; as if they even rejoyc'd they had once been destroy'd, _Auctior tuis facta beneficiis._ So as not only a Diadem binds your sacred Temples this day; but you have even crown'd all your Subjects too; so has your auspicious presence gilded all things; our Churches, Tribunals, Theaters, Palaces, lift up their heads again; the very fields do laugh and exalt. O happy, and blessed spring! not so glorious yet with the pride and enamel of his flowers, the golden corn, and the gemms of the pregnant Vine, as with those Lillies and Roses which bloom and flourish in your Chaplet this day, to which not only these, but even all the productions of nature seem to bend, and pay their homage.  And let it be a new year, a new _Æra_, to all the future Generations, as it is the beginning of this, and of that immense, _Platonic_ Revolution; for what could arrive more justly, more stupendious, were even the eight sphear it self now hurled about? For no sooner came our _CHARLES_ on shore, but every Man was in the Haven where he would be; the storm Universally ceas'd, and every one ran forth to see our _Palladium, tanquam coelo delapsum_: Virgins, Children, Women, trembling old Men, venerating the very ship that wafted our _Jason_ and his _Heroes_, ravish'd with the sight, yet hardly believing for astonishment; the greatness of the miracle, oppressing our sences, and endangering our very faith.      _Credetne hoc olim ventura posteritas?_  I would prayse you Great Prince, but having begun; where shall I make an end? since there remains not a Topic through all that kind, but one might write Decads of it, without offending the truth, were it as secure of your modesty; since I am as well to consider what your ears can suffer, as what is owing to your Virtues: On what heads shall I extend then my discourse? your Birth, Country, Form, Education, Manners, Studies, Friends, Honours and Fortune run through all partitions of the Demonstrative: An Orator could have nothing more to wish for, nor your Majesty to render you more accomplish'd.  Shall I consider then your Majesty as you were a Son to that glorious Father before his _Apotheosis_? As you were your self a Confessor after it; As you are now thus day in your Zenith and exaltation; and as we Augure you will by Gods blessing prove to your Subjects hereafter: For even through all these does our prospect lead us; Nor may it be objected that what shall be spoken of your Majesty, can be applied to any other; since the Fortune and Events of the rest of Princes, have been so differing from yours; as seeming to have been conducted by Men alone, and second Causes; yours only by God, and as it were by Miracle.  I begin then with your early Piety to that Kingly Martyr whose Sacred dictates did institute your tender years, and whose sufferings were so much alleviated by your Majesties early proficiency in all that might presage a hopefull and glorious Successor: For so did you run through all his Vicissitudes, during that implacable war, which sought nothing more then to defeat you of all opportunities of a Princely education, as fearing your future Virtues; because they knew the stock from whence you sprung, was not to be destroy'd by wounding the body, so long as such a Branch remained.      _Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus     Nigræ feraci frondis in Algido,       Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso       Ducit opes, animumque ferro._  Whilst he Reign'd and Govern'd, you learn'd only to obey; Living your own Princely Impress; [SN: _ICH DIEN._] as knowing it would best instruct you one day how to Command, and which we now see accomplish'd: These then are the effects, when Princes are the Sons of Nobles; since only such know best to support the weight, who use to bear betimes, and by degrees; not those who rashly pull it on their shoulders; because they take it with less violence, less ambition, less jealousie: None so secure a Prince, as he that is so born.  But no sooner did that blessed Martyr expire, then our redivive _Phoenix_ appear'd; rising from those Sacred Ashes Testator and Heir; Father and yet Son; Another, and yet the same; introsuming as it were his Spirit, as he breath'd it out, when singing his own Epicedium and Genethliack together, he seem'd prodigal of his own life to have it redouble'd in your felicity: Thus, _Rex nunquam moritur_. O admirable conduct of the Divine Providence, to immortalize the image of a just Monarch: _Ipsa quidem, sed non eadem, quia & ipsa, nec ipsa est._ Since that may as truly be apply'd to your Majesty, which was once to the wisest of Kings: _Mortuus est Pater ejus, & quasi non mortuus, similem enim reliquit sibi post se._  But with how much prudence, is serenity attributed amongst the titles of Princes, and the beams of the sun to irradiate their Crowns; That the Scepter bears a Flower; since as that glorious planet produces, so does it also wither them; and there is nothing lasting, save their vertues, which are indeed their essential parts, and only immortal; For even yet did the clouds intercept our day with the continuance of so dismall a storm, as it obnubilated all those hopes of ours. It is an infinite adventure, if in a Princes Family [HW: Firmament] (once overcast) it ever grow fair weather again, but by a singular "]]]
