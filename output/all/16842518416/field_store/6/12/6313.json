It was an additional sting to his humiliation, that he knew every servant in and about the house rejoiced at his discomfiture, and he imagined that there was a veiled smile of satisfaction, at his bruised visage and his notorious disgrace with the squire, on the face of every man he met outside, and of every woman who passed him in the house.  During the whole week he did not venture near the stables, for there he knew that he had rendered himself specially obnoxious, and there was nothing for him to do but to saunter listlessly about the garden, until the day arrived that the letter came granting the squire's request, and begging that he might be sent off at once, as the vessel would probably put to sea in a few days.  \"Now, Richard,\" the squire said that evening to him, in a kinder voice than he had used on the last occasion, \"you understand exactly how we stand towards each other. That being so, I do not wish to maintain our present uncomfortable relations. You have had your punishment, and, unless I hear to the contrary, I shall assume that the punishment has had its effect. When you return from sea, after your first voyage, you will come home here as if nothing had happened, and this business need never be alluded to between us. If you turn out as I have hitherto believed you to be, I shall receive you as warmly as if my opinion of you had never been shaken.  \"I have requested Captain Sinclair to let me know what is the average allowance that the midshipmen receive from their parents, and shall see that you have as much as your messmates. I have also asked him to kindly allow one of his officers to order you a proper outfit in all respects, and to have the bill sent in to me. So now, my boy, you will have a fresh and a fair start, and I trust that you will turn out everything that I can wish.\"  \"I will try, sir. I will indeed,\" Richard said earnestly; and he spoke from his heart, for the inheritance was very dear to him, and it would be a terrible thing indeed to forfeit it.  For two years after Richard Horton's departure, things went on quietly at Sidmouth. James Walsham continued to make a pet and a playmate of little Aggie. Her out-of-door life had made her strong and sturdy, and she was able to accompany him in all his rambles, while, when he was at work at home preparing fishing lines, making boats, or otherwise amusing himself, she was content to sit hours quietly beside him, chattering incessantly, and quite content with an occasional brief answer to the questions. When he was studying, she too would work at her lessons; and however much she might be puzzled over these, she would never disturb him by asking him questions when so engaged.  She was an intelligent child, and the hour's lesson, morning and afternoon, soon grew into two. She was eager to learn, and rapidly gained ground on Mrs. Walsham's older pupils. During the two years, that lady never had cause to regret that she had yielded to the sergeant's entreaties. Aggie was no trouble in the house, which she brightened with her childish laughter and merry talk; and her companionship, James's mother could not but think, did the boy much good. It softened his manner, and, although he still often went out with the fishermen, he was no longer thrown entirely for companionship upon the boys on the beach.  The sergeant came and went, seldom being more than two months without paying a visit to Sidmouth. The child was always delighted to see her grandfather, and James took to him greatly, and liked nothing better than to stroll up with him to a sheltered spot on the hillside, where he would throw himself down on the grass, while the sergeant smoked his pipe and told him stories of his travels and adventures, and Aggie ran about looking for wildflowers, or occasionally sat down, for a while, to listen also.  The squire lived his usual lonely life up at the Hall. The absence of his nephew, whose ship had sailed for a foreign station, was a relief rather than otherwise to him. It had, from the first, been a painful effort to him to regard this boy as his heir, and he had only done it when heartsick from a long and fruitless search for one who would have been nearer and dearer to him. Nor had he ever taken to the lad personally. The squire felt that there was not the ring of true metal in him. The careless way in which he spoke of his parents showed a want of heart; and although his uncle was ignorant how much the boy made himself disliked in the household, he was conscious, himself, of a certain antipathy for him, which led him to see as little of him as possible.  The two years, for which the sergeant had placed his grandchild with Mrs. Walsham, came to an end. That he did not intend to continue the arrangement, she judged from something he said on the occasion of his last visit, two months before the time was up, but he gave no hint as to what he intended to do with her.  In those weeks Mrs. Walsham frequently thought the matter over. That the sergeant had plans for the child she could hardly doubt. The child herself had told her that she knew of no other relations than her grandfather, and yet he could hardly intend to take her about with him, after placing her for two years in a comfortable home. She was but seven years old now--far too young to go out into a place as servant girl in a farm house. She doubted not that the sergeant had expended the whole of his savings, and she thought him foolish in not having kept her with him for some little time longer, or, if he could not do that, he might have placed her with some honest people, who would have kept her for the sum he had paid until she was old enough to take a place as a nurse girl.  And yet, while she argued thus, Mrs. Walsham felt that the old showman had not acted without weighing the whole matter. There must be something in it which she did not understand. In fact, he had said so when he placed the child with her.  As the time approached, she became more worried at the thought of Aggie leaving her. The little one had wound herself very closely round her heart. The expense of keeping her was small indeed, the cost of her food next to nothing; while the extra girl, whom Mrs. Walsham had taken on when she first came, had been retained but a very short time, James's constant companionship with her rendering the keeping of a nurse altogether unnecessary.  At last she made up her mind that she would offer to keep her on without pay. She and James would miss her companionship sorely, and it could not be considered an extravagance, since the money she had received for her would pay for the cost of her keep for years to come. When Mrs. Walsham's mind was once made up, her only fear was that these mysterious plans of the sergeant would not allow him to leave Aggie with her.  Punctual to the day, Sergeant Wilks arrived, and after a little talk in the parlour, as usual, with James and Aggie present, he formally requested the favour of a conversation with Mrs. Walsham alone.  \"Take Aggie for a walk, James. Do not stay out above three quarters of an hour, as your tea will be ready for you then.\"  \"You must have wondered, ma'am, a good deal,\" the sergeant began when they were alone, \"why I, who get my living by travelling the country with a peep show, wished to place my grandchild in a position above her, and to have her taught to be a little lady. It is time now that I should tell you. Aggie is my granddaughter, but she is the granddaughter, too, of Squire Linthorne up at the Hall.\"  \"Bless me!\" Mrs. Walsham ejaculated, too astonished for any further expression of her feelings.  \"Yes, ma'am, she is the daughter of the squire's son Herbert, who married my daughter Cissie.\"  \"Dear me, dear me,\" Mrs. Walsham said, \"what an extraordinary thing! Of course I remember Herbert Linthorne, a handsome, pleasant young fellow. He was on bad terms, as everyone heard, eight years ago, with his father, because he married somebody beneath--I mean somebody of whom the squire did not approve. A year afterwards, we heard that he was dead, and there was a report that his wife was dead, too, but that was only a rumour. The squire went away just at the time, and did not come back for months afterwards, and after that he was altogether changed. Before, he had been one of the most popular men in this part of the country, but now he shut himself up, gave up all his acquaintances, and never went outside the park gates except to come down to church. I remember it gave us quite a shock when we saw him for the first time--he seemed to have grown an old man all at once. Everyone said that the death of his son had broken his heart.  \"And Aggie is his granddaughter! Well, well, you have astonished me. But why did you not tell me before?\"  \"There were a good many reasons, ma'am. I thought, in the first place, you might refuse me, if you knew, for it might do you harm. The squire is a vindictive man, and he is landlord of your house; and if he came to know that you had knowingly taken in his granddaughter, there was no saying how he might have viewed it. Then, if you had known it, you might have thought you ought to keep her in, and not let her run about the country with your son; and altogether, it would not have been so comfortable for you or her. I chose to put her at Sidmouth because I wanted to come here often, to hear how the squire was going on; for if he had been taken ill I should have told him sooner than I intended.\"  \"But why did you not tell him before?\" Mrs. Walsham asked.  \"Just selfishness, ma'am. I could not bring myself to run the risk of having to give her up. She was mine as much as his, and was a hundred times more to me than she could be to him. I took her a baby from her dead mother's arms. I fed her and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17767"],["title","Pee-wee Harris Adrift (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

PEE-WEE HARRIS ADRIFT   CHAPTER I  ALONE  When Pee-wee Harris returned from Temple Camp in the fall, he found himself a scout without a patrol.  He had indulged in a colossal speculation and lost out.  Forsaking the Raving Ravens, he had set forth to mobilize all the small, unattached boys at camp into the Pollywog Patrol, but the Pollywog Patrol had proved about as substantial as the shifting sand.  Like the beloved Black Lake it had both an inlet and an outlet.  As fast as one boy entered it another had to go home, so that conducting the Pollywog Patrol was like pouring water into a leaky pail.  Pee-wee, with all his flaunted efficiency, could not be at both ends of this patrol at the same time.  As soon as some miniature scout from New York had been duly initiated, some previously initiated scout from Chicago found that his time was up, and Pee-wee's time was chiefly occupied in rushing frantically about trying to keep pace with this epidemic of resignations.  At last the epidemic reached an acute stage and the Pollywog Patrol, after a glorious career of nine days, was struck a mortal blow, never to be heard of again except in the pages of history.  Its three remaining members were summoned to their several homes simultaneously; one new scout was hastily secured but on learning that he could not be patrol leader he tendered his resignation and was soon called home to attend his sister's wedding.  Scout Harris faced a cruel world alone.  Meanwhile, Billy Simpson had been called to Temple Camp from Bridgeboro to fill (if anyone could fill) the enormous space left vacant in the Raven Patrol by the withdrawal of its enterprising genius.  \"Never mind,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, the troop's scoutmaster, \"there are plenty of fish in the sea--to say nothing of Pollywogs.  Bridgeboro is full of permanent material.  You have all this winter to round up a new patrol.\"  \"Only don't round up any snow men because they melt,\" said Roy Blakeley, leader of the Silver Foxes; \"and don't bother with shadows because you can't depend on them.  And when you get a scout put a paper weight on him so he won't blow away.\"  \"If you'll give me some of the biscuits you make, I'll use them for weights,\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"You mean you'll eat them,\" Roy said.  \"What are you going to name the new patrol?  Why don't you name it the Canned Salmon?  Then they can't get away from you.\"  \"Sure, you can have a can-opener for your emblem,\" said Dorry Benton.  \"Maybe we'll call ourselves the Airedales because scouts like fresh air,\" Pee-wee said.  \"I got a lot of ideas.\"  \"He thinks Airedales are named after the air,\" said Doc Carson.  \"Sure, just the same as Pennsylvania is named after the Pennsylvania Railroad,\" Roy said.  \"You make me tired!\" Pee-wee shouted disgustedly.  \"You leave it to me, I'll think up a name.  I know four fellers already that'll join.  Maybe I'll decide to start a whole new troop and not bother with this one.\"  \"Why don't you start a whole new scout movement?\" Roy asked.  \"Call it the Boy Scouts of Pee-wee Harris.  Discharge the Boy Scouts of America altogether.\"  \"I'll start something all right, you leave it to me,\" Pee-wee announced darkly.  \"You think you're smart just because you write stories about your adventures and you always make out that you're the hero.  You always make out that I get the worst of it.  Gee whiz, if I ever write any stories, I'll get my just deserts.\"  \"Did I ever say you didn't get plenty of desserts?\" Roy shot back at him.  \"I gave you three helpings in every story and that's all the thanks I get.  You think so much about desserts that you're going to desert the troop.  We should worry.\"  \"If I write any stories I'll write them good and loud,\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"Open the cut-out of your fountain pen,\" Roy said, \"and be sure to turn to the right whenever you come to the end of a page and look out you don't skid.\"  \"Maybe I'll write my remittances,\" Pee-wee said darkly.  \"He means his reminiscences,\" said Artie Van Arlen.  \"I think,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"that Scout Harris will be quite busy enough forming the new patrol, and when it is formed I hope he will present it to the First Bridgeboro Troop, B. S. A.\"  \"That's us,\" said Westy Martin.  \"I don't see how Pee-wee can get out of the troop,\" Mr. Ellsworth laughed, \"because strictly speaking, he has never been in the troop; on the contrary the troop has been in him, as one might say.\"  \"_Good night_, did he swallow that too?\" said Roy.  And he rolled backward off the troop-room table on which he had been sitting.     CHAPTER II  SATURDAY MORNING  Though Pee-wee was without a patrol he was by no means without a troop. He still held his position of troop mascot and official target for the mirthful Silver Foxes.  He was a whole patrol in himself and held his own against raillery and banter, his stock of retaliatory ammunition seeming never to be exhausted.  \"I can handle them with both hands tied behind my back,\" he boasted, which is readily enough believed since it was mainly his tongue that he used.  But recruits did not flock to Pee-wee's standard.  Perhaps this was partly because of the fall and winter season when the lure of camping and roughing it was in abeyance.  Perhaps it was because he was so small that boys were fain to think that scouting was a thing for children and beneath their dignity.  Once or twice during the winter, Pee-wee piloted some half-convinced and bashful subject to the troop-room, which was an old railroad car (of fond memory) down by the river.  Here, in the cosy warmth of the old cylinder stove, the troop played checkers and read and jollied Pee-wee, which was about all there was to do on winter nights.  The visitors, unimpressed with these makeshift diversions of the off season, did not return, and so the good old springtime found Pee-wee still a scout indeed (with something left over) but a scout without a patrol.  And now the sturdy little missionary began to feel this keenly.  Patrol spirit is usually not much in evidence during the winter; the several divisions of a troop intermingle and form a sort of club in which an odd member is quite at home.  But with the coming of spring the patrol spirit becomes aroused.  It is a case of \"united we stand, divided we sprawl,\" as Roy Blakeley was fond of saying.  Each patrol goes separately about its preparations for camping and hiking, does its shopping, repairs its tents, denounces and ridicules its associate patrols, and troop unity gives way somewhat to patrol unity.  This is well and as it should be.  It was very much so with the well organized Bridgeboro troop.  With the first breath of spring the Ravens became Ravens, the Elks foregathered and were Elks and nothing else, and the Silver Foxes began a series of exclusive meetings at Camp Solitaire under a big shady elm on Roy's lawn.  The Silver Foxes, imbibing the mirthful spirit of their leader, were all pretty much alike, and the Ravens were thankful that they were not like them, and the Elks congratulated themselves that they had more pep than the Ravens.  \"The Elks say the Ravens are no good and the Ravens say the Elks are no good and they're both right; we should worry,\" said Roy.  \"There's one good thing about the Elks and that is that they're not Ravens, and there's one good thing about the Ravens and that is that they're not Elks.  They both have everything to be thankful for if not more so.  They're in luck.\"  \"Do you call that logic?\" Pee-wee demanded in the tones of an earthquake.  \"If one thing is better than another thing how can that other thing be better than the other thing?  You're crazy!\"  \"Goodness gracious, look who's here?\" said Hunt Manners, who was sorting out some fishhooks.  \"The whole Canned Salmon Patrol.\"  Pee-wee stood outside the tent, breathing hard after his long tramp up the hill to the Blakeley place.  \"Don't you know this is private land?\" Warde Hollister said, rather heedless of the possible effect of his remark.  \"I didn't come in the tent, did I?\" Pee-wee retorted wistfully.  \"Come ahead in, Kid,\" said Roy.  \"Are you hungry?  Here's some fish-hooks.\"  \"No, "]]]
