SONG ON MAY MORNING.     Now the bright morning Star, Dayes harbinger,   Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her   The Flowry May, who from her green lap throws   The yellow Cowslip, and the pale Primrose.   Hail bounteous May that dost inspire   Mirth and youth, and warm desire,   Woods and Groves, are of thy dressing,   Hill and Dale, doth boast thy blessing.   Thus we salute thee with our early Song,   And welcom thee, and wish thee long.                                 10     ON SHAKESPEAR.  1630.     WHAT needs my Shakespear for his honour'd Bones,   The labour of an age in piled Stones,   Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid   Under a Star-ypointing Pyramid?   Dear son of memory, great heir of Fame,   What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?   Thou in our wonder and astonishment   Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.   For whilst to th'shame of slow-endeavouring art,   Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart                          10   Hath from the Leaves of thy unvalu'd Book,   Those Delphick lines with deep impression took,   Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving,   Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;   And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,   That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.

HERE lies old Hobson, Death hath broke his girt,   And here alas, hath laid him in the dirt,   Or els the ways being foul, twenty to one,   He's here stuck in a slough, and overthrown.   'Twas such a shifter, that if truth were known,   Death was half glad when he had got him down;   For he had any time this ten yeers full,   Dodg'd with him, betwixt Cambridge and the Bull.   And surely, Death could never have prevail'd,   Had not his weekly cours of carriage fail'd;                         10   But lately finding him so long at home,   And thinking now his journeys end was come,   And that he had tane up his latest Inne,   In the kind office of a Chamberlin   Shew'd him his room where he must lodge that night,   Pull'd off his Boots, and took away the light:   If any ask for him, it shall be sed,   Hobson has supt, and 's newly gon to bed.     ANOTHER ON THE SAME.     HERE lieth one who did most truly prove,   That he could never die while he could move,   So hung his destiny never to rot   While he might still jogg on, and keep his trot,   Made of sphear-metal, never to decay   Untill his revolution was at stay.   Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime   'Gainst old truth) motion number'd out his time:   And like an Engin mov'd with wheel and waight,   His principles being ceast, he ended strait.                         10   Rest that gives all men life, gave him his death,   And too much breathing put him out of breath;   Nor were it contradiction to affirm   Too long vacation hastned on his term.   Meerly to drive the time away he sickn'd,   Fainted, and died, nor would with Ale be quickn'd;   Nay, quoth he, on his swooning bed out-stretch'd,   If I may not carry, sure Ile ne're be fetch'd,   But vow though the cross Doctors all stood hearers,   For one Carrier put down to make six bearers.                        20   Ease was his chief disease, and to judge right,   He di'd for heavines that his Cart went light,   His leasure told him that his time was com,   And lack of load, made his life burdensom   That even to his last breath (ther be that say't)   As he were prest to death, he cry'd more waight;   But had his doings lasted as they were,   He had bin an immortall Carrier.   Obedient to the Moon he spent his date   In cours reciprocal, and had his fate                                30   Linkt to the mutual flowing of the Seas,   Yet (strange to think) his wain was his increase:   His Letters are deliver'd all and gon,   Onely remains this superscription.

And may at last my weary age   Find out the peacefull hermitage,   The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell,   Where I may sit and rightly spell                                   170   Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew,   And every Herb that sips the dew;   Till old  experience do attain   To somthing like prophetic strain.
