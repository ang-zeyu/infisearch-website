His father, roused for once from his lifelong patience, had been rather terrible in that last scene; so terrible that he had never forgiven himself, or really believed himself fully forgiven by God, though his son had alienated half the village and nearly rent the parish in twain by his conduct.  As for Letty, she held her peace. She could only hope that the minister and his wife suspected nothing, and she was sure of Beulah's point of view. That a girl would never give up a suitor, if she had any hope of tying him to her for life, was a popular form of belief in the community; and strangely enough it was chiefly the women, not the men, who made it current. Now and then a soft-hearted and chivalrous male would observe indulgently of some village beauty, \"I shouldn't wonder a mite if she could 'a' had Bill for the askin'\"; but this opinion would be met by such a chorus of feminine incredulity that its author generally withdrew it as unsound and untenable.  It was then, when Dick had gone away, that the days had grown drab and long, but the twins kept Letty's inexperienced hands busy, though in the first year she had the help of old Miss Clarissa Perry, a childless expert in the bringing-up of babies.  The friendship of Reba Larrabee, so bright and cheery and comprehending, was a never-ending solace. There was nothing of the martyr about Letty. She was not wholly resigned to her lot, and to tell the truth she did not intend to be, for a good many years yet.  \"I'm not a minister, but I'm the wife of a minister, which is the next best thing,\" Mrs. Larrabee used to say. \"I tell you, Letty, there's no use in human creatures being resigned till their bodies are fairly worn out with fighting. When you can't think of another mortal thing to do, be resigned; but I'm convinced that the Lord is ashamed of us when we fold our hands too soon!\"  \"You were born courageous, Reba!\" And Letty would look admiringly at the rosy cheeks and bright eyes of her friend.  \"My blood circulates freely; that helps me a lot. Everybody's blood circulates in Racine, Wisconsin.\"--And the minister's wife laughed genially. \"Yours, hereabouts, freezes up in your six months of cold weather, and when it begins to thaw out the snow is ready to fall again. That sort of thing induces depression, although no mere climate would account for Mrs. Popham.--Ossian said to Luther the other day: 'Maria ain't hardly to blame, parson. She come from a gloomy stock. The Ladds was all gloomy, root and branch. They say that the Ladd babies was always discouraged two days after they was born.'\"  The cause of Letty's chief heartache, the one that she could reveal to nobody, was that her brother should leave her nowadays so completely to her own resources. She recalled the time when he came home from Boston, pale, haggard, ashamed, and told her of his marriage, months before. She could read in his lack-lustre eyes, and hear in his voice, the absence of love, the fear of the future. That was bad enough, but presently he said: \"Letty, there's more to tell. I've no money, and no place to put my wife, but there's a child coming. Can I bring her here till--afterwards? You won't like her, but she's so ailing and despondent just now that I think she'll behave herself, and I'll take her away as soon as she's able to travel. She would never stay here in the country, anyway; you couldn't hire her to do it.\"  She came: black-haired, sullen-faced Eva, with a vulgar beauty of her own, much damaged by bad temper, discontent, and illness. Oh, those terrible weeks for Letty, hiding her own misery, putting on a brave face with the neighbors, keeping the unwelcome sister-in-law in the background.  It was bitterly cold, and Eva raged against the climate, the house, the lack of a servant, the absence of gayety, and above all at the prospect of motherhood. Her resentment against David, for some reason unknown to Letty, was deep and profound and she made no secret of it; until the outraged Letty, goaded into speech one day, said: \"Listen, Eva! David brought you here because his sister's house was the proper place for you just now. I don't know why you married each other, but you did, and it's evidently a failure. I'm going to stand by David and see you through this trouble, but while you're under my roof you'll have to speak respectfully of my brother; not so much because he's my brother, but because he's your husband and the father of the child that's coming:--do you understand?\"  Letty had a good deal of red in her bronze hair and her brown eyes were as capable of flashing fire as Eva's black ones; so the girl not only refrained from venting her spleen upon the absent David, but ceased to talk altogether, and the gloom in the house was as black as if Mrs. Popham and all her despondent ancestors were living under its roof.  The good doctor called often and did his best, shrugging his shoulders and lifting his eyebrows as he said: \"Let her work out her own salvation. I doubt if she can, but we'll give her the chance. If the problem can be solved, the child will do it.\"     [Illustration]  IV   Well, the problem never was solved, never in this world, at least; and those who were in the sitting-room chamber when Eva was shown her two babies lying side by side on a pillow, never forgot the quick glance of horrified incredulity, or the shriek of aversion with which she greeted them.  Letty had a sense of humor, and it must be confessed that when the scorned and discarded babies were returned to her, and she sat by the kitchen stove trying to plan a second bottle, a second cradle, and see how far the expected baby could divide its modest outfit with the unexpected one, she burst into a fit of hysterical laughter mingled with an outpour of tears.  The doctor came in from the sick-room puzzled and crestfallen from his interview with an entirely new specimen of woman-kind. He had brought Letty and David into the world and soothed the last days of all her family, and now in this tragedy--for tragedy it was--he was her only confidant and adviser.  Letty looked at him, the tears streaming from her eyes.  \"Oh, Doctor Lee, Doctor Lee! If an overruling Providence could smile, wouldn't He smile now? David and Eva never wanted to marry each other, I'm sure of it, and the last thing they desired was a child. Now there are two of them. Their father is away, their mother won't look at them! What will become of me until Eva gets well and behaves like a human being? I never promised to be an aunt to twins; I never did like twins; I think they're downright vulgar!\"      \"Waly waly! bairns are bonny:     One's enough and twa's ower mony,\"  quoted the doctor. \"It's worse even than you think, my poor Letty, for the girl can't get well, because she won't! She has gritted her teeth, turned her face to the wall, and refused her food. It's the beginning of the end. You are far likelier to be a foster mother than an aunt!\"  Letty's face changed and softened and her color rose. She leaned over the two pink, crumpled creatures, still twitching nervously with the amazement and discomfort of being alive.  [Illustration: \"COME TO YOUR AUNT LETTY THEN AND BE MOTHERED!\" SHE SOBBED]  \"Come to your Aunt Letty then and be mothered!\" she sobbed, lifting the pillow and taking it, with its double burden, into her arms. \"You shan't suffer, poor innocent darlings, even if those who brought you into the world turn away from you! Come to your Aunt Letty and be mothered!\"  \"That's right, that's right,\" said the doctor over a lump in his throat. \"We mustn't let the babies pay the penalty of their parents' sins; and there's one thing that may soften your anger a little, Letty: Eva's not right; she's not quite responsible. There are cases where motherhood, that should be a joy, brings nothing but mental torture and perversion of instinct. Try and remember that, if it helps you any. I'll drop in every two or three hours and I'll write David to come at once. He must take his share of the burden.\"  Well, David came, but Eva was in her coffin. He was grave and silent, and it could not be said that he showed a trace of fatherly pride. He was very young, it is true, thoroughly ashamed of himself, very unhappy, and anxious about his new cares; but Letty could not help thinking that he regarded the twins as a sort of personal insult,--perhaps not on their own part, nor on Eva's, but as an accident that might have been prevented by a competent Providence. At any rate, he carried himself as a man with a grievance, and when he looked at his offspring, which was seldom, it seemed to Letty that he regarded the second one as an unnecessary intruder and cherished a secret resentment at its audacity in coming to this planet uninvited. He went back to his work in Boston without its having crossed his mind that anybody but his sister could take care of his children. He didn't really regard them as children or human beings; it takes a woman's vision to make that sort of leap into the future. Until a new-born baby can show some personal beauty, evince some intellect, stop squirming and squealing, and exhibit enough self-control to let people sleep at night, it is not, as a rule, _persona grata_ to any one but its mother.  David did say vaguely to Letty when he was leaving, that he hoped \"they would be good,\" the screams that rent the air at the precise moment of farewell rather giving the lie to his hopes.  Letty was struggling to end the interview without breaking down, for she was worn out nervously as well as physically, and thought if she could only be alone with her problems and her cares she would rather write to David than tell him her mind face to face.  Brother and sister held each other tightly for a moment, kissed each other good-bye, and then Letty watched Osh Popham's sleigh slipping off with David into the snowy distance, the merry tinkle of the bells adding to the sadness in her dreary heart.

The two joys of her life were missing and in their places two unknown babies whose digestive systems were going to need constant watching, according to Dr. Lee. Then she went about with set lips, doing the last sordid things that death brings in its wake; doing them as she had seen her mother do before her. She threw away the husks in Eva's under mattress and put fresh ones in; she emptied the feathers from the feather bed and pillows and aired them in the sun while she washed the ticking; she scrubbed the paint in the sick-room, and in between her tasks learned from Clarissa Perry the whole process of bringing up babies by hand.  That was three years ago. At first David had sent ten dollars a month from his slender earnings, never omitting it save for urgent reasons. He evidently thought of the twins as \"company\" for his sister and their care a pleasant occupation, since she had \"almost\" a living income; taking in a few coats to make, just to add an occasional luxury to the bare necessities of life provided by her mother's will.  His letters were brief, dispirited, and infrequent, but they had not ceased altogether till within the last few months, during which Letty's to him had been returned from Boston with \"Not found\" scribbled on the envelopes.  The firm in whose care Letty had latterly addressed him simply wrote, in answer to her inquiries, that Mr. Gilman had not been in their employ for some time and they had no idea of his whereabouts.  The rest was silence.     [Illustration]  V   A good deal of water had run under Beulah Bridge since Letty Boynton had sat at her window on a December evening unconsciously furnishing copy and illustration for a Christmas card; yet there had been very few outward changes in the village. Winter had melted into spring, burst into summer, faded into autumn, lapsed into winter again,--the same old, ever-recurring pageant in the world of Nature, and the same procession of incidents in the neighborhood life.  The harvest moon and the hunter's moon had come and gone; the first frost, the family dinners and reunions at Thanksgiving, the first snowfall; and now, as Christmas approached, the same holiday spirit was abroad in the air, slightly modified as it passed by Mrs. Popham's mournful visage.  One or two babies had swelled the census, giving the minister hope of a larger Sunday-School; one or two of the very aged neighbors had passed into the beyond; and a few romantic and enterprising young farmers had espoused wives, among them Osh Popham's son.  The manner of their choice was not entirely to the liking of the village. Digby Popham had married into the rival church and as his betrothed was a masterful young lady it was feared that Digby would leave Mr. Larrabee's flock to worship with his wife. Another had married without visible means of support, a proceeding always to be regretted by thoroughly prudent persons over fifty; and the third, Deacon Todd's eldest son, had somehow or other met a siren from Vermont and insisted on wedding her when there were plenty of marriageable girls in Beulah.  \"I've no patience with such actions!\" grumbled Mrs. Popham. \"Young folks are so full of notions nowadays that they look for change and excitement everywheres. I s'pose James Todd thinks it's a decent, respectable way of actin', to turn his back on the girls he's been brought up an' gone to school with, and court somebody he never laid eyes on till a year ago. It's a free country, but I must say I don't think it's very refined for a man to go clear off somewheres and marry a perfect stranger!\"  Births, marriages, and deaths, however, paled into insignificance compared with the spectacular début of the minister's wife as a writer and embellisher of Christmas cards, two at least having been seen at the local milliner's store. How many she had composed, and how many of them (said Mrs. Popham) might have been rejected, nobody knew, though there was much speculation; and more than one citizen remarked on the size of the daily package of mail matter handed out by the rural delivery man at the parsonage gate.  No one but Mrs. Larrabee and Letty Boynton were in possession of all the thrilling details attending the public appearance of these works of art; the words and letters of appreciation, the commendation, and the occasional blows to pride that attended their acceptance and publication.  Mrs. Larrabee's first attempt, with the sketch of Letty at the window on Christmas Eve, her hearth-fire aglow, her heart and her door open that Love might enter in if the Christ Child came down the snowy street,--this went to the Excelsior Card Company in a large Western city, and the following correspondence ensued:       MRS. LUTHER LARRABEE,           _Beulah, N.H._       DEAR MADAM:--       Your letter bears a well-known postmark, for my father and      my grandfather were born and lived in New Hampshire, \"up      Beulah way.\" I accept your verses because of the beauty of      the picture that accompanied them, and because Christmas      means more than holly and plum pudding and gift-laden trees      to me, for I am a religious man,--a ministerial father and      three family deacons saw to that, though it doesn't always      work that way!--Frankly, I do not expect your card to have a      wide appeal, so I offer you only five dollars.       A Christmas card, my dear madam, must have a greeting, and      yours has none. If the pictured room were a real room, and      some one who had seen or lived in it should recognize it, it      would attract his eye, but we cannot manufacture cards to      meet such romantic improbabilities. I am emboldened to ask      you (because you live in Beulah) if you will not paint the      outside of some lonely, little New Hampshire cottage, as      humble as you like, and make me some more verses; something,      say, about \"the folks back home.\"                                           Sincerely yours,                                             REUBEN SMALL.                                                      BEULAH, N.H.       DEAR MR. SMALL:--       I accept your offer of five dollars for my maiden effort in      Christmas cards with thanks, and will try my hand at      something more popular. I am not above liking to make a      \"wide appeal,\" but the subject you propose is rather a      staggering one, because you accompany it with a phrase      lacking rhythm, and difficult to rhyme. You will at once      see, by running through the alphabet, that \"roam\" is the      only serviceable rhyme for \"_home_,\" but the union of the      two suggests jingle or doggerel. I defy any minor poet when      furnished with such a phrase, to refrain from bursting at      once into:--       No matter where you travel, no matter where you roam,      You'll never dum-di-dum-di-dee          The folks back home.                                           Sincerely yours,                                             REBA LARRABEE.       P.S. On second thought I believe James Whitcomb Riley could      do it and overcome the difficulties, but alas! I have not      his touch!       DEAR MRS. LARRABEE:--       We never refuse verses because they are too good for the      public. Nothing is too good for the public, but the public      must be the judge of what pleases it.       \"The folks back home\" is a phrase that will strike the eye      and ear of thousands of wandering sons and daughters. They      will choose that card from the heaped-up masses on the      counters and send it to every State in the Union. If you      will glance at your first card you will see that though      people may read it they will always leave it on the counter.      I want my cards on counters, by the thousand, but I don't      intend that they should be left there!       Make an effort, dear Mrs. Larrabee! I could get \"the folks      back home\" done here in the office in half an hour, but I'm      giving you the chance because you live in Beulah, New      Hampshire, and because you make beautiful pictures.                                           Sincerely yours,                                             REUBEN SMALL.       DEAR MR. SMALL:--       I enclose a colored sketch of the outside of the cottage      whose living-room I used in my first card. I chose it      because I love the person who lives in it; because it always      looks beautiful in the snow, and because the tree is so      picturesque. The fact that it is gray for lack of paint may      remind a casual wanderer that there is something to do, now      and then, for the \"folks back home.\" The verse is just as      bad as I thought it would be. It seems incredible that any      one should buy it, but ours is a big country and there are      many kinds of people living in it, so who knows? Why don't      you accept my picture and then you write the card? I could      not put my initials on this! They are unknown, to be sure,      and I should want them to be, if you use it!                                           Sincerely yours,                                             REBA LARRABEE.           Now here's a Christmas greeting            To the \"folks back home.\"          It comes to you across the space,            Dear folks back home!          I've searched the wide world over,            But no matter where I roam,          No friends are like the old friends,            No folks like those back home!       DEAR MRS. LARRABEE:--       I gave you five dollars for the first picture and verses,      which you, as a writer, regard more highly than I, who am      merely a manufacturer. Please accept twenty dollars for \"The      Folks Back Home,\" on which I hope to make up my loss on the      first card! I insist on signing the despised verse with your      initials. In case R. L. should later come to mean      something, you will be glad that a few thousand people have      seen it.  "]]]
