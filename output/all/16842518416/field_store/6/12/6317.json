Their gallant barque labored under a veritable mountain of miscellaneous paraphernalia and out of the pile projected a long bar with a device on the end of it which glinted red and green in the sunshine.  \"It looks like a weather-vane,\" said Billy.  \"There's something printed on it,\" said Roly.  \"It says _STOP_,\" said the boy they called Nuts.  \"It says _GO_,\" said the boy they called Brownie.  \"I think,\" said Townsend, scrutinizing the approaching transport in his funny way, \"I think, I _think_, it's a traffic sign.  You don't see any automobiles in the canoe, do you?\"  \"There's something sticking out on the left side,\" said Billy; \"I think it's a Ford.  I hope the island isn't going to be overrun by motorists.\"  \"It's not a Ford, it's a dishpan,\" said Brownie.  \"They're the same thing,\" said Townsend.  \"What is that on the duffel bag--a license plate?\"  Suddenly the voice of the discoverer floated across the expanse of sun-flickered water.  \"We're going to have hunter's stew for supper and I'm going to make it and my mother says I can stay all through Easter vacation and I got a lot of things out of our attic.  Do you like bananas?  I've got a whole bunch and I've got a lot of new ideas--dandy ones!  I know how to fry them!  I know how to slice them and fry them!\"  \"I'd like to try some fried ideas,\" said Townsend.  \"I don't think I ever ate them sliced before.\"  It may be said that Pee-wee's ideas, whether fried or baked or boiled or roasted, were usually underdone and required to be put back into the oven.  Be that as it may, he soon proceeded to unload these, as well as the interesting junk which he had gathered, the most surprising object of which was the dilapidated revolving traffic sign lately discarded by the Bridgeboro police department in favor of a lighthouse or silent cop, so called.  This acquisition was the pride of Pee-wee's life; its heavy metal stand had long since gone the way of all junk and it could not stand unsupported.  As Pee-wee plunged it heroically in the earth and stood holding it with one hand he looked not unlike Columbus planting the flaunting emblem of Ferdinand and Isabella on the shore of San Salvador, except that this tableau of the well known historical episode was somewhat marred by the fact of his holding a half eaten banana in his other hand.  But his new friends stared with all the amazement shown by the natives upon the landing of that other great discoverer. Only a specific inventory can do justice to the provisions and furniture which Pee-wee brought.    One revolving police traffic sign   One large phonograph horn   One dishpan full of crullers (taken in a masterly       assault upon the Harris pantry)   One tent   One duffel bag with cooking set   Part of a vacuum cleaner   One scout belt axe   One Thanksgiving horn   One automobile siren horn.   One lantern   Two long clothesline supporters   A towel-rack that opened like a fan   A skein of clothesline   A small kitchen-range shovel   Two boxes filled with canned goods   One box filled with loose edibles   One ice cream freezer  \"Didn't you bring a cow?\" Townsend asked.  \"We can never make ice cream without cream.\"  \"We're in reach of the mainland, aren't we?\" Pee-wee retorted thunderously.  \"It isn't as if we were going out of sight of land; gee whiz, then I'd have brought quite a lot of stuff.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" said Townsend.  \"I just picked up a few odds and ends,\" Pee-wee explained.  \"I'm going to make a couple of more trips to-morrow.\"  \"If you happen to think of it bring a lawnmower,\" said Townsend; \"they come in handy.  And a few life preservers if you happen to have any, in case the island goes to pieces.\"  \"How can it go to pieces?\" Pee-wee demanded.  \"Islands don't go to pieces, do they?  Australia is an island, isn't it?  It's just where it always was, isn't it?  You're crazy!  All we need is one more scout and I know one by the name of Keekie Joe, and I'm going to try to get him and then we'll be a full patrol and I decided to name it the Alligators, because they belong on land and water both and we're sea scouts on the land kind of, so maybe I'll decide to name it the Turtles, maybe.\"  \"Discoverer,\" said Townsend, \"we're with you whatever you do, but there is a mystery about this island which I would like to fathom before we organize----\"  \"I fathomed lots of mysteries,\" shouted Pee-wee.  \"I don't know whether you know what erosion means----\"  \"Sure I know what it means,\" said Pee-wee; \"it means getting rusty, kind of.\"  \"It means land being washed away by water.  If you put a piece of land in the water, the water will dissolve it and it won't take long either. It isn't like an island that has always been where it is--a kind of hill sticking up out of the water.  This is just a piece of land and the roots of this little tree won't hold it together long.  \"The question is, should we go hunting for new members under those conditions?  Pretty soon we'll have a full patrol and no island under us; we'll be in the water.  That's perfectly agreeable to me and all the rest of us.  But does Keekie Joe know how to swim?  We really have no _grounds_ for forming a patrol.  See?\"  \"Do you call that an argument?\" Pee-wee thundered.  \"It shows how much you know about geography because look at an ice cream soda!  Does that corrode?  Let's hear you answer that?  Or erode or whatever you call it.  A chunk of ice cream floats in the soda, doesn't it?  Maybe after a while it melts, but this land isn't ice cream, is it?  \"That shows how much you know about logic.  This island has been here ever since early this morning, hasn't it?  And it's just as big as it was, isn't it?  An island is an island and the water won't melt it unless it's hot--like a lump of sugar in a cup of coffee.  You've got to stir it up to melt it.  Is North America corroding?  Or Coney Island?  Is this island any smaller than it was?\"  \"No, it isn't, and that's the funny part,\" said Townsend.  \"We've explored the coast but we haven't explored the depths.  Let's have that little shovel a minute, will you?\"     CHAPTER XIII  \"STOP\"  The ice cream soda argument was not a good one at all, for no lump of ice cream ever remained long intact where Pee-wee was.  Whether it melted or not, it disappeared.  And why this freakish little island did not rapidly dissolve was a mystery.  By all the laws it should have melted away, leaving the deserted tree to topple over and form a new obstruction to boating.  But there it was floating more easily as the tide rose, with apparently no intention of allowing itself to be absorbed by the surrounding waters.  It is true that a belt of muddy water bordered its wild and forbidding coast and that its shore line was of a consistency suitable for the making of mud pies, but its body seemed as solid and resistant as a rock.  Pee-wee always claimed that it was he and he alone who discovered the mysterious secret of Merry-go-round Island; he and he alone who penetrated its unknown depths.  In this bold exploration a courageous sardine sandwich played an important part and out of sheer gratitude Pee-wee, from that time forward, was ever partial to sardine sandwiches, regarding them with tender and grateful affection.  He was standing near the apple tree holding the traffic sign like a pilgrim's banner beside him and, as has been told, eating a banana with the other hand.  That fact is well established.  Little he thought that when Roly Poly, delving into a paper bag that was in a grocery box, handed him a sardine sandwich, it would mark an epoch in scout history.  In order to accept the proffered refreshment, Pee-wee was compelled either to relinquish the traffic sign or the banana.  One moment of frantic consideration held him, then in a burst of inspiration he plunged the metal standard deep into the ground, and took the sardine sandwich in his free hand.  The printed cross-piece on the traffic sign joggled around so that just as he plunged his mouth into the sandwich the word GO made an appropriate announcement to his comrades.  It is hard to say what might have happened if Townsend Ripley had not turned the sign so that it said STOP just as Pee-wee consumed the last mouthful.  \"Isstrucsmlikewood,\" ejaculated Pee-wee, consuming the last mouthful. \"Issoundlkbo--boards!\"  Billy was quick to raise the bar of the traffic sign and plunge it down again.  It was certainly no tentacle of root that the probing bar struck, but something hard, yet ever so slightly yielding, something which gave forth a hollow sound.  It was easy to explore America after Columbus had shown the way and it was a simple matter now for Townsend, with the little shovel, to dig a hole three or four feet deep about the traffic sign.  The boys all kneeled about, peering in as if buried treasure were there, until an area of muddy wood was revealed.  Roly Poly knocked it with a rock and the noise convinced them that the wood was of considerable area and that probably _nothing was beneath it_.  \"Well--what--do--you--know--about--that?\" Billy asked incredulously.  \"Jab it down somewhere else,\" said Brownie.  Pee-wee moved the metal rod a yard or so distant and plunged it in the ground again.  There was the same hollow sound.  For a moment they all sat spellbound, mystified.  Then, as if seized by a sudden thought, Brownie hurried to the edge of the little island, exploring with his hands.  He lifted up some grassy soil that drooped and hung in the water, and tore it away.  As he did so there was revealed a ridge of heavy wood over which it had hung.  By the same process he exposed a yard or two of this black mud-covered edge.  \"Well--I'll--be--_jiggered_!\" said Billy.  \"It's a scow or something!\" said Brownie, almost too astonished to speak.  \"The island seems to overlap"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17767"],["title","Pee-wee Harris Adrift (#8)"],["body"," sort of like a pie-crust,\" drawled Townsend.  \"The scow is the undercrust!\" shouted Pee-wee, delighted with this comparison to his favorite edible.  \"We'll call it Apple-pie Island and it can't corrode or erode or whatever you call it, either, because it's boxed in!\"  That indeed seemed to be the way of it.  Apparently the island reposed comfortably in and over the edges of a huge, shallow box of heavy timbers which had received it with kindly hospitality when it broke away and toppled over into the water.  As we know, the river had eaten away the land under the little balcony peninsula, and the scow, or whatever it was, must have drifted or been moored underneath the earthy projection.  \"Maybe it belonged to that big dredge that was working up here,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Anyway it's lucky for us, hey?  Because now our island has a good foundation and it can't dis--what d'you call it.\"  \"Only it complicates the question of ownership,\" said Townsend, apparently not in the least astonished or excited.  \"Here is a piece of land belonging to old Trimmer on a scow or something or other belonging to a dredging company or somebody or other and claimed by the boy scouts by right of discovery.\"  \"Old Trimmer owned the land,\" Pee-wee fairly yelled, \"but now the land isn't there any more and now it's an island so he doesn't own it because he's got a deed and it doesn't say _island_ on the deed!  _Gee whiz_, anybody knows that.\"  \"But suppose the owner of the scow wants his property,\" Townsend said.  \"Let him come and get it,\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"If we get a deed for this island the scow is covered by the deed!\"  \"You mean it's covered by the island,\" Brownie said.  \"Well, we seem to be standing still now, anyway,\" said Townsend; \"it's a relief to know that when we wake up to-morrow morning we won't be floating in the water.  Who's got a match?  Let's start a fire and begin moving toward the hunter's stew.\"  \"We don't need matches,\" Pee-wee said with a condescending sneer.  \"Do you think scouts use matches?  They light fires by rubbing sticks. Matches are civilized.\"  Whereupon Pee-wee gave a demonstration of not getting a light by the approved old Indian fashion of rubbing sticks and striking sparks from stones and so on.  \"Here comes a man down the river in a motorboat,\" said Nuts; \"turn the stop sign that way and we'll ask him for a match.\"  Pee-wee, somewhat subdued by his failure, confronted the approaching boat with the red panel which said STOP, and held his hand up like a traffic officer.  But there was no need of requiring the approaching voyager to pause. For he had every intention of pausing.  Neither would there have been any use of asking him for a match.  For he never gave away matches.  Old Trimmer never gave away anything.  He would not even give away a secret, he was so stingy.  To get a match from old Trimmer you would have had to give him chloroform.  It was said that he would not look at his watch to see what time it was for fear of wearing it out, and that he looked over the top of his spectacles to save the lenses.  At all events he was so economical that he seldom wasted any words, and the words that he did waste were not worth saving; they were not very nice words.     CHAPTER XIV  \"GO\"  Old Trimmer chugged up to the edge of the island in the shabbiest, leakiest little motor dory on the river, and grasped a little tuft of greensward to keep his boat from drifting.  \"Well, now, what's all this?\" he began.  \"What you youngsters been doin' up the river, eh?\"  \"This used to be your land before it was an island,\" said Pee-wee diplomatically.  \"I bet you'll say it's funny how it used to be your apple tree and everything.  But it broke away and kind of fell down and now it's an island and we discovered it.  It can't--one thing--it can't ever be a peninsula again, that's sure.  Islands, they're discovered and then you own them, that's the way it is.  Findings is keepings with islands.\"  \"Is that so?\" said old Trimmer, half-interested and examining what might be called the underpinning of the island with keen preoccupation.  [Illustration: The boys hold the island in spite of old Trimmer's protest.]  \"Well, you'll just clear off'n this here property double quick.  Pile in here and I'll set you ashore.\"  \"Don't you go,\" urged Pee-wee; \"we've got a right here; we're going to camp on this island.\"  \"Sure we are,\" said Roly Poly.  \"And you can't make us get off, either, because it isn't on your land.\"  Old Trimmer wasted no words.  \"Pile in here, all of you,\" he said, indicating the boat, \"or I'll have yer all up fer trespassin'.\"  \"Do you own this old scow or whatever it is underneath us?\" Townsend asked quietly.  \"Look a'here, young feller, no talkin' back,\" said old Trimmer testily; \"come along, step lively.  I'm going to tow this whole business back up to where it belongs.  Now d'ye want me ter set yer ashore or not?\"  \"Not,\" said Roly Poly.  \"I don't think we have anything to say about it, Mr. Trimmer,\" said Townsend.  \"The land that used to be part of your field seems to be on a scow or something or other and we're on the land that's on the scow. We're here because we're here----\"  \"Let's hear you answer that argument!\" shouted Pee-wee in a voice of thunder.  \"This is a river, isn't it?  Do you deny that?  It's an inward waterway--I mean inland--and it belongs to the government and this scow or whatever it is, is on it and something that used to be a peninsula but isn't any more is on the scow and we're on the thing that used to be a peninsula----\"  \"In the shade of the young apple tree,\" said Townsend.  \"That's just what I was going to say,\" said Pee-wee, \"and you can't put us off this land because if that's trespassing then the land is trespassing too--it's trespassing on the scow--so we won't get off the land till you take the land off the scow and put it back where it belongs and then we'll get off it because, gee whiz, scouts have no right to trespass.\"  He paused, not for lack of arguments but for lack of breath.  \"So that's the way it is, is it?\" said old Trimmer darkly.  \"Well, we'll see.\"  \"Sure we'll see,\" said Pee-wee.  \"That shows how much you know about geography and international law and all those things.  Suppose Cape Cod should break off and float away.  Would it belong to New Hampshire any more--I mean Connecticut--I mean Massachusetts?  Gee whiz, we're going to stay right here because we're on a public waterway and anyway you don't own the scow that this land is on, do you?\"  There was, of course, no answer to this fine analysis of the legal points involved.  \"That there scow was under my land,\" said old Trimmer.  \"It was in the river and it wasn't on anybody's land as I understand it,\" said Townsend in his funny way.  \"Your land trespassed on the scow----\"  \"Sure it did!\" interrupted Pee-wee.  \"It really had no right to do that, Mr. Trimmer, unless you can show that you own the scow.  As I understand it this is a kind of a legal sandwich.  The land that used to be a part of your field is between  the scow and us----\"  \"Sure it is!\" vociferated Pee-wee, caught by the idea of a sandwich so huge and picturesque.  \"We're kind of like one of the slices of bread and the scow is the other slice.  It's thick and dark like rye bread,\" he added to make the picture more graphic.  \"It's a kind of a legal sandwich,\" said Townsend, sitting back against the tree with his knees drawn up and talking with a calmness and seriousness which aroused the wrath of old Trimmer.  \"It's a kind of an interesting situation.  We have as much right on the scow as the land has, as I see it----\"  \"Sure, you learn that in the third grade!\" shouted Pee-wee.  \"That's logic.\"  \"Really, the best thing to do,\" drawled Townsend, \"would be to remove the land, which would let us down onto the scow and that would let you out of the difficulty.  We'd be answerable to the owner of the scow.\"  \"It belonged to the big dredge,\" Pee-wee said excitedly.  \"I knew all the men on that dredge; I used to hang out on that dredge; those men were all friends of mine.  We wouldn't be trespassing except your land is in the way.\"  \"If you want us to shovel the land out of here we'll do it,\" suggested Roly Poly.  \"Then the tree'll fall over,\" said Brownie.  \"Gee whiz,\" shouted Pee-wee, \"it'll serve the tree right because all the time fellers are being accused of trespassing in apple trees and now you can see for yourself that apple trees are just as bad.  They trespass on scows.\"  \"We could have this tree fined ten dollars,\" said Billy, \"if we wanted to report it to the dredging company in New York.\"  \"Or it would have to go to jail for thirty days,\" yelled Pee-wee.  \"I don't see what we're going to do, Mr. Trimmer,\" said Townsend.  \"I know what we're going to do,\" said Pee-wee; \"we're going to do a lot of things.  We're natives of this island.\"  \"We don't recognize this land,\" said Townsend; \"we consider it beneath us.\"  \"Sure it's beneath us!\" shouted Pee-wee.  \"It simply happens to trespass on the scow first,\" said Townsend.  \"I think we'll stand on our rights.\"  \"Well, yer ain't goin' ter stand on my property, yer ain't!\" old Trimmer bellowed, his wrath rising.  Townsend's calmness seemed to goad him to a perfect frenzy.  \"Well, then,\" said Townsend, \"the only thing for us to do is to shovel out a space and camp on that.  Then our feet will be on the scow----\"  \"We'll be on friendly territory,\" shouted Pee-wee.  \"Your land can camp here with us if it wants to.\"  \"Or you can take it away, just as you please,\" said Townsend.  \"Only we warn you not to take any liberties with this scow.  We're personally acquainted with Mr. Steam of the Steam Dredging Company and we're going to charter this scow, now that we're on it.  We can get another desert island to put on it if necessary.\"  \"Do you see this traffic sign?\" Pee-wee yelled at the top of his voice. He stood like some conquering hero, holding the martial stop sign with one hand.  \"The bottom of this "]]]
