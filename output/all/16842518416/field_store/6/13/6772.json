At one time she had in the play-house a little regiment of twelve toads, a red squirrel, and a large turtle.  Aunt Mary never wished her to cage her pets, as she thought it cruel; consequently they had the range of the play-house, and Gabrielle fed them very conscientiously.  She ought, however, to have followed the example of St. Francis, who used to preach to animals and insects when he had no human audience, and given her pets a daily dissertation upon brotherly love and tolerance, for they did not, I regret to say, live together in the Christian harmony that distinguished Barnum's Happy Family.  The result was, that one day when Gabrielle went to minister to their physical wants, she found only a melancholy _débris_ of little legs.  Her supposition was that the turtle had consumed the toads and then died of dyspepsia, and that the squirrel had by some unknown means escaped from the play-house, and returned to primeval liberty.  [Illustration: The Children's Play House.]  Forgetting this sad experience, Gabrielle endeavored at another time to bring up a snake and a toad in the way they should go (this time in an empty hen-coop); but the snake certainly did depart from it, and astonished the family much by gliding into the kitchen with the unhappy toad in his mouth.  Poor Gabrielle's feelings can be imagined.  She endeavored courageously to wrest the toad from its enemy's jaws, but all in vain; she was obliged to see the hapless creature consumed by the snake.  Mamma has often described Aunt Mary to me as she looked when she first met her.  The portrait mamma draws of her as a bride would scarcely be recognized by those who only knew her after long years of weary illness had    \"Paled her glowing cheek.\"  I will give it in mamma's own words:  \"Immediately after your uncle's marriage, he sent for me to come from my parents' quiet farm in Pennsylvania, to spend the winter in the city with himself and his wife.  A great event this was to me--far greater than your first visit to Europe, for the journey occupied double the time that is now spent between New York and Liverpool, and I was a young girl whose acquaintance with the world was confined to the narrow limits of the little village of Clymer; I had never even been sent away to boarding-school.  \"One bright September morning I started upon my eventful journey.  Your uncle Barnes drove me in a buggy to Buffalo, a distance of three days at that time.  At this city--the first large one that I had ever seen, my brother left me in charge of a party going through, as he supposed, to New York.  Then ensued two weeks upon a canal boat; very slow travelling you children would consider it, accustomed as you are to whirling over the country in an express train; but at my romantic age, this dreamy, delicious style of boat travel was the perfection of happiness.  \"At Rochester my friends left me, first placing me under the care of the captain of the canal-boat, who promised to put me upon the steamboat when we should reach Albany.  \"The prospect of the day to be spent upon the Hudson possessed no charms for me, but on the contrary, untold terror.  I had never before seen a steamboat, but they had been introduced upon Lake Erie, near enough to my home for me to hear, with alarm, of all the accidents that had so far befallen them upon that very turbulent sheet of water; consequently, I embarked upon the 'Washington,' in the full conviction that I was about to meet with my doom.  \"All that day I sat motionless in a corner of the promenade deck, reading my Bible.  Perfectly oblivious alike to the magnificent scenery that I was passing, and to the elegant toilettes such as my country-bred eyes had never before beheld, by which I was surrounded; I neither spoke to nor looked at any one, nor dared to leave my seat even to go to dinner; but endeavored to gain, from the sacred volume in my hands, strength for the terrible fate that I was confident awaited me. I have often since wondered what my fellow-travellers thought of the still, shy little figure whose eyes were never once lifted from her Bible.  \"About four o'clock a terrible explosion was heard, the boat was thrown violently upon her side, and a scene of confusion, shrieks, and fainting-fits then ensued.  I did not faint--I was much too alarmed for that; I merely turned very white, and trembled from head to foot.  The wheel-house had been blown away, I learnt before long, but no one fortunately was injured, and after a delay of an hour or so the boat was righted, and we proceeded upon our journey, at a snail's pace, however.  \"Owing to the accident, we did not reach New York until ten o'clock. No one was at the pier to meet me, for brother had supposed that I would arrive before sunset.  As I did not appear, however, he concluded that I had not left Albany at the time appointed.  But my adventures of the day were not yet over.  I secured a cab, and drove to the address he had given me, 123 Hudson Street, which in 1836 was by no means the plebeian locality it is at present, but a fashionable street, devoted exclusively to elegant residences.  Upon inquiring for Mr. Greeley, my consternation was great to learn that although he had looked at rooms in that house, he had not engaged them, and the landlady had no idea of his address.  I was almost as timid about cabs as I had been about the steamboat; for I had heard stories of young girls being robbed and murdered by New York cab-drivers, and here I was, late at night, in all the whirl and excitement of the metropolis, driving I knew not where, and entirely at the mercy of an assassin.  However, my modest trunk did not look very inviting, I suppose, for I reached _The New Yorker_ office--the only other address I knew in the city--without further adventure, where I ascertained that brother was now living at 124 Greenwich Street--a most beautiful situation close by the Battery--then the fashionable promenade of New York.  He had written to tell me of his change of residence, but the letter failed to reach me.  \"It was half-past eleven when I finally reached my home.  The large parlor was ablaze with lights, and crowded with people; for it was Friday, the night that _The New Yorker_ went to press, and brother's reception evening.  I was trembling with fatigue and excitement, and very faint, for I had not eaten since early in the morning; but all these emotions vanished when I was introduced to my new sister.  I had seen no pictures of her, and knew her only through brother's description, and a few letters she had written me since her marriage, and I was quite unprepared for the exquisite, fairy-like creature I now beheld.  A slight, girlish figure, rather _petite_ in stature, dressed in clouds of white muslin, cut low, and her neck and shoulders covered by massive dark curls, from which gleamed out an Oriental-looking _coiffure_, composed of strands of large gold and pearl beads.  Her eyes were large, dark, and pensive, and her rich brunette complexion was heightened by a flush, not brilliant like Gabrielle's, but delicate as a rose-leaf.  She appeared to me like a being from another world.\"  To continue mamma's reminiscences of uncle's first year of married life:  \"I found my sister-in-law's tastes,\" she said, \"quite different from those of the majority of young ladies.  In literature her preference was for the solid and philosophic, rather than the romantic class of reading; indeed, I may say that she never read, she _studied_; going over a paragraph several times, until she had fully comprehended its subtleties of thought, and stored them away in her retentive memory for future use.  During that year, I never knew her to read a work of fiction; but philosophy or science formed her daily nourishment; whilst brother, whenever he had a free evening, read aloud to Mary and I from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, sweetened now and then with a selection from Lord Byron or Mrs. Hemans--the two poets that at that time he preferred.  \"But although your Aunt Mary had such severe literary tastes, she was by no means gloomy in her disposition, as you might perhaps infer. Your uncle being at that time editor of a weekly journal, he was comparatively a man of leisure, and he and Mary went frequently to the theatre, and to hear lectures--a source of great enjoyment to both of them.  They also mingled considerably in general society, for Mary was then very fond of dancing, although there was rarely or never any at her Friday evenings, for literary people then, as now, eschewed the goddess Terpsichore.  \"I told you that I arrived in New York upon brother's reception-night. Those Friday evenings wore a great source of pleasure to me, introducing me as they did to the literary coterie of the metropolis. Nearly all the men and women of note at that time met in our parlors on Greenwich Street, and many of them were regular or occasional contributors to brother's journal.  Among the names that I can recall, were Gen. Morris, then editing the _New York Mirror_; the two Clark brothers, editors of the _Knickerbocker_, one of whom, Willis Gaylord Clark, was at that time writing his clever 'Ollapodiana;' Fitz-Greene Halleck, the poet; George M. Snow, who later in life became financial editor of _The Tribune_, and is now deceased; Professor A. C. Kendrick, of Hamilton College, the translator of Schiller's 'Victor's Triumph,' which subsequently appeared in _The New Yorker_, and which, you will remember, your uncle has occasionally read for us at our own Tuesday evening receptions; Mrs. O. M. Sawyer, the accomplished wife of brother's pastor, then making her _débût_ in the literary world with poems and occasional translations from the German; Elizabeth Jessup Eames, who was writing stories and poems for _The New Yorker_, under the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],["title","The Story of a Summer (#8)"],["body","of 'Stella;' Mrs. E. F. Ellet, in 1836 a handsome young bride, who had come up from the South, and was contributing translations from the French and German to the same journal; Anne Cora Lynch, now Madame Botta; and many others.  \"I must not forget to mention Fisher, the sub-editor of _The New Yorker_, and, in his own estimation, the most important person upon that journal.  He was what might be called a literary fop, and was much given to the production of highly-wrought, Byronic poems and sketches. I remember hearing that some one called one day at the office, and asked to see the editor.  Fisher immediately presented himself.  \"'What!' said the visitor, somewhat surprised, 'are you Mr. Greeley?'  \"'No,' said Fisher, running his fingers nonchalantly through his curls, 'I am not Mr. Greeley, but,' drawing himself up, 'I am the editor of _The New Yorker_.  Mr. Greeley is only the printer.'  \"This incident having got out among brother's friends, it was considered so good a joke that for years he was called in the office and by the literary fraternity, 'The Printer.'  \"The entertainment at these Friday evenings was mainly conversation, varied by the occasional reading of a poem.  Your Aunt Mary was much admired that winter, both for her exquisite beauty and the charm of her winning, artless manners.  As I said, she was very fond of dancing; but brother never had time to accomplish himself in the art.  I remember, however, that at a Christmas party given by his partner, Mr. Wilson, he was induced to dance a quadrille.  His mathematical accuracy enabled him to go through the figures perfectly, when he had once seen them danced; and he enjoyed it so thoroughly, and wore such an air of unconscious happiness, that an old Quaker lady (the mother-in-law of Mr. Wilson) who was looking on remarked to me, 'I didn't think thee could find so beautiful a sight as thy brother's dancing this side of heaven.'  \"I have described your Aunt Mary as beautiful, and perhaps you would infer that she was also over-fond of dress.  She was no devotee to fashion, and her toilet was, even at that period, characterized by great simplicity, but was noted, at the same time, for picturesqueness.\"  Ida showed me, the other day, a very interesting letter written to her father by a friend, Mr. Yancey, who was present at his marriage, and as it confirms what mamma has said of Aunt Mary's beauty, I will make some extracts from it.  Mr. Yancey was the son-in-law of Squire Bragg, at whose house Aunt Mary resided while teaching school in North Carolina.   \"GERMANTOWN, TENNESSEE, _July 6, 1847_.  \"MR. GREELEY:  \"DEAR SIR:--Sitting to-night 'all solitary and alone,' my mind has wandered back upon scenes that have past eleven years ago, though vivid now even as yesterday.  It was about that time that I saw you first, and indeed saw you last.  \"Little did I then dream that I beheld in that modest personage one who is now acknowledged as the 'distinguished and accomplished Horace Greeley.'  \"You well remember your first visit to the South, I dare say.  You cannot have forgotten many incidents that occurred at a little village of North Carolina, called Warrenton?  No, there is _one_ circumstance I feel assured you never can forget while memory lasts, and there are others to which I claim the right to call your attention: for instance, do you remember your first meeting with a certain Miss Cheney at the house of Squire Bragg, the father of Capt. Bragg, who lately distinguished himself at Monterey and Buena Vista?  Do you now remember to whom you related the secret of your visit, who procured the parson, and what persons accompanied you to church, and then with your beautiful bride returned to breakfast?  We saw you take the solemn vows, we witnessed the plighted betrothal, and when you bore away from us this prize, you also carried our best wishes that you might be ever blessed, and she be made always happy.  May it not have been otherwise.\"  . . . . \"I would, my dear sir, be pleased to hear from you, and to learn something of the results and changes which time has brought about in your own family.  \"Be pleased to remember me to your sweet wife, and if there be any, or many little G------s, my kind regards to them also.  \"Very respectfully,  \"A. L. YANCEY.\"     CHAPTER VI.  Visitors--Our Neighbors--The Chappaqua Croquet Club--Gabrielle's Letter--A Hiding Party--Summer Heat--The Music-room--Friends from the City.   _June 18_.  While out on the croquet ground this afternoon, a lady and gentleman alighted from a carriage, and walked up to join us.  They proved to be our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Wilbour, of New York, who had driven over from White Plains to make us an afternoon call.  Mrs. Wilbour is a charming, intellectual woman, the president of Sorosis, and a friend of many years of both mamma and Aunt Mary.  In appearance she is tall, handsome, and queenly, dressing in perfect taste, and a graceful hostess.  Her pretty daughter Linny is a school friend of Gabrielle's at St. Mary's.  Mr. and Mrs. Wilbour spend much time during the summer, driving about from one town to another; certainly the most comfortable and agreeable mode of travelling that one could adopt.  We have some agreeable neighbors here, who contribute somewhat to the general entertainment.  The aristocracy of Chappaqua are chiefly Quaker families who have lived here since the days of the Indians, and who look down quite doubtfully upon the New York families who come out here for the summer only, and of whose ancestry they know nothing.  The fathers and mothers wear the Quaker dress, and use the \"Friends\" phraseology, which I think very pretty and caressing, but the young people depart somewhat from the way of grace, in speech, costume, and habits.  The young girls wear whatever color of the rainbow best suits their fresh complexions, are skilled in flirting, and with the assistance of the young gentlemen, have organized a club for weekly croquet parties and private theatricals at the residences of the different members, whilst picnics and riding-parties to Croton and Rye Lakes, and other pretty points of interest, are of frequent occurrence. But of the riding-parties Gabrielle has just written a sprightly description to a school friend, and before the letter goes to the post, I will transcribe it.   CHAPPAQUA, _June 18_.  \"DEAR MOLLIE: I received your charming letter and photograph last week. Many thanks for both.  You ask me how do I pass my time, and what is the latest excitement?  \"Well, to begin with, you must know that we have just started a club in Chappaqua for mutual amusement, but as I have been indisposed for some time, I certainly have not yet derived much benefit from it, but spend most of my time reading.  \"Last Saturday I was just longing for something to happen, and apostrophizing the world as a hollow sham, when Minna came up to say that we had all been invited to an equestrian party, to start after tea.  You would have imagined I had been offered several kingdoms by my delight.  I gave two or three screams of condensed joy, while dancing wildly around the room, much to Aunt Esther's surprise.  \"But on second thoughts, what _was_ I to do for a horse?  My ponies had never been broken to the saddle, but having made up my mind to go, go I would, if I had to ride a wild buffalo; so I ordered Lady Alice around an hour before the time to start.  When she arrived, the balcony was filled with a large and anxious audience, and rather than fail before so many, I was determined that either I should break the horse in, or she should break me.  I sprang into the saddle, but before I could seat myself or put my foot in the stirrup, she jerked her head away from Bernard, and commenced a series of exciting manoeuvres, rearing, plunging, and kicking.  For about five minutes I defied all the laws of gravitation.  But when the coachman tried to seize her bridle, she shied so suddenly that I was surprised to find myself on terra firma. I jumped up directly and assured every one that I had not hurt myself in the least, in fact had never felt better; but between you and me, I felt very like the dog that was tossed by the cow with the crumpled horn.  I am afraid that by this time I had let my little angry passions rise--in other words, I was decidedly angry.  \"I got on splendidly this time, and was quite ready to start with my cousins when the time came, although my Lady Alice evinced serious objections to the gate, and preferred ambling gently along sideways up the hill.  After a while I intimated kindly with my whip a desire to gallop.  I fear that, like some of our friends, she is hard to take a hint, for she progressed by the most wonderful plunges, garnished with little kicks; but I kept her head well up, and clawed out several handfuls of her mane.  When we came to the rendezvous, my cavalier proposed running her for two or three miles to take down her spirits a little, after which she went beautifully, and I never enjoyed a ride so much before.  \"We rode to Lake Wampus, and everything looked so lovely, for the full moon lighted it up like a mirror, and we had singing and thrilling ghost stories.  \"Dear me, how awfully long this letter is!  Be sure you answer it soon.  \"Yours lovingly,  \"GABRIELLE.\"   _June 19_.  The heat and dust are becoming insufferable, for we have had no rain, save in very homoeopathic doses, during the three weeks that we have been here.  The shrubs and bushes by the roadside look so piteous under their weight of dust, that I feel half inclined to try the effect of a feather brush upon their drooping leaves; and Bernard, who is never prone to take cheerful views of anything, grows daily more gloomy when we inquire after the progress of the kitchen-garden.  But, although we are sighing under the heat, it is nothing, we are told, to what the New Yorkers are now enduring, and our friends, Mrs. Acheson and Dr. Taylor, who came out yesterday from the city to spend "]]]
