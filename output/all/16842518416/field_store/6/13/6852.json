In 1784 the North-West Territory, as it was called, was ceded by Virginia to the old Congress of the days before the Union.  Jefferson then endeavoured to pass an Ordinance by which slavery should be excluded from all territory that might ever belong to Congress.  In this indeed he failed, for in part of the territory likely to be acquired slavery was already established, but the result was a famous Ordinance of 1787, by which slavery was for ever excluded from the soil of the North-West Territory itself, and thus, when they came into being, the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin found themselves congenitally incapable of becoming slave States.  The further achievements of that generation in this matter were considerable.  It must of course be understood that the holding of slaves and the slave trade from Africa were regarded as two distinct questions. The new Congress abolished the slave trade on the first day on which the Constitution allowed it to do so, that is, on January 1, 1808.  The mother country abolished it just about the same time.  But already all but three of the States had for themselves abolished the slave trade in their own borders.  As to slavery itself, seven of the original thirteen States and Vermont, the first of the added States, had abolished that before 1805.  These indeed were Northern States, where slavery was not of importance, but in Virginia there was, or had been till lately, a growing opinion that slavery was not economical, and, with the ignorance common in one part of a country of the true conditions in another part, it was natural to look upon emancipation as a policy which would spread of itself.  At any rate it is certain fact that the chief among the men who had made the Constitution had at that time so regarded it, and continued to do so.  Under this belief and in the presence of many pressing subjects of interest the early movement for emancipation in America died down with its work half finished.  But before this happy belief expired an economic event had happened which riveted slavery upon the South.  In 1793 Eli Whitney, a Yale student upon a holiday in the South, invented the first machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds.  The export of cotton jumped from 192,000 lbs. in 1791 to 6,000,000 lbs. in 1795.  Slave labour had been found, or was believed, to be especially economical in cotton growing.  Slavery therefore rapidly became the mainstay of wealth and of the social system in South Carolina and throughout the far South; and in a little while the baser sort of planters in Virginia discovered that breeding slaves to sell down South was a very profitable form of stock-raising.  We may pass to the year 1820, when an enactment was passed by Congress which for thirty-four years thereafter might be regarded as hardly less fundamental than the Constitution itself.  Up till then nine new States had been added to the original thirteen.  It was repugnant to principles still strong in the North that these States should be admitted to the Union with State Constitutions which permitted slavery.  On the other hand, it was for two reasons important to the chief slave States, that they should be.  They would otherwise be closed to Southern planters who wished to migrate to unexhausted soil carrying with them the methods of industry and the ways of life which they understood.  Furthermore, the North was bound to have before long a great preponderance of population, and if this were not neutralised by keeping the number of States on one side and the other equal there would be a future political danger to slavery.  Up to a certain point the North could with good conscience yield to the South in this matter, for the soil of four of the new slave States had been ceded to the Union by old slave States and slave-holders had settled freely upon it; and in a fifth, Louisiana, slavery had been safeguarded by the express stipulations of the treaty with France, which applied to that portion, though no other, of the territory then ceded. Naturally, then, it had happened, though without any definite agreement, that for years past slave States and free States had been admitted to the Union in pairs.  Now arose the question of a further portion of the old French territory, the present State of Missouri.  A few slave-holders with their slaves had in fact settled there, but no distinct claims on behalf of slavery could be alleged.  The Northern Senators and members of Congress demanded therefore that the Constitution of Missouri should provide for the gradual extinction of slavery there.  Naturally there arose a controversy which sounded to the aged Jefferson like \"a fire-bell in the night\" and revealed for the first time to all America a deep rift in the Union.  The Representatives of the South eventually carried their main point with the votes of several Northern men, known to history as the \"Dough-faces,\" who all lost their seats at the next election. Missouri was admitted as a slave State, Maine about the same time as a free State; and it was enacted that thereafter in the remainder of the territory that had been bought from France slavery should be unlawful north of latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes, while by tacit agreement permitted south of it.  This was the Missouri Compromise.  The North regarded it at first as a humiliation, but learnt to point to it later as a sort of Magna Carta for the Northern territories.  The adoption of it marks a point from which it became for thirty-four years the express ambition of the principal American statesmen and the tacit object, of every party manager to keep the slavery question from ever becoming again a burning issue in politics.  The collapse of it in 1854 was to prove the decisive event in the career of Abraham Lincoln, aged 11 when it was passed.   5. _Leaders, Parties, and Tendencies in Lincoln's Youth_.  Just about the year 1830, when Lincoln started life in Illinois, several distinct movements in national life began or culminated.  They link themselves with several famous names.  The two leaders to whom, as a young politician, Lincoln owed some sort of allegiance were Webster and Clay, and they continued throughout his long political apprenticeship to be recognised in most of America as the great men of their time.  Daniel Webster must have been nearly a great man.  He was always passed over for the Presidency.  That was not so much because of the private failings which marked his robust and generous character, as because in days of artificial party issues, when vital questions are dealt with by mere compromise, high office seems to belong of right to men of less originality.  If he was never quite so great as all America took him to be, it was not for want of brains or of honesty, but because his consuming passion for the Union at all costs led him into the path of least apparent risk to it.  Twice as Secretary of State (that is, chiefly, Foreign Minister) he showed himself a statesman, but above all he was an orator and one of those rare orators who accomplish a definite task by their oratory.  In his style he carried on the tradition of English Parliamentary speaking, and developed its vices yet further; but the massive force of argument behind gave him his real power.  That power he devoted to the education of the people in a feeling for the nation and for its greatness.  As an advocate he had appeared in great cases in the Supreme Court.  John Marshall, the Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835, brought a great legal mind of the higher type to the settlement of doubtful points in the Constitution, and his statesmanlike judgments did much both to strengthen the United States Government and to gain public confidence for it.  It was a memorable work, for the power of the Union Government, under its new Constitution, lay in the grip of the Courts. The pleading of the young Webster contributed much to this.  Later on Webster, and a school of followers, of whom perhaps we may take \"our Elijah Pogram\" to have been one, used ceremonial occasions, on which Englishmen only suffer the speakers, for the purpose of inculcating their patriotic doctrine, and Webster at least was doing good.  His greatest speech, upon an occasion to which we shall shortly come, was itself an event.  Lincoln found in it as inspiring a political treatise as many Englishmen have discovered in the speeches and writings of Burke.  Henry Clay was a slighter but more attractive person.  He was apparently the first American public man whom his countrymen styled \"magnetic,\" but a sort of scheming instability caused him after one or two trials to be set down as an \"impossible\" candidate for the Presidency.  As a dashing young man from the West he had the chief hand in forcing on the second war with Great Britain, from 1812 to 1814, which arose out of perhaps insufficient causes and ended in no clear result, but which, it is probable, marked a stage in the growth of loyalty to America.  As an older man he was famed as an \"architect of compromises,\" for though he strove for emancipation in his own State, Kentucky, and dreamed of a great scheme for colonising the slaves in Africa, he was supremely anxious to avert collision between North and South, and in this respect was typical of his generation.  But about 1830 he was chiefly known as the apostle of what was called the \"American policy.\"  This was a policy which aimed at using the powers of the national Government for the development of the boundless resources of the country.  Its methods comprised a national banking system, the use of the money of the Union on great public works, and a protective tariff, which it was hoped might chiefly operate to encourage promising but \"infant\" industries and to tax the luxuries of the rich.  Whatever may have been the merits of this policy, which made some commotion for a few years, we can easily understand that it appealed to the imagination of young Lincoln at a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18380"],["title","The War After the War (#0)"],["body","WAR AFTER THE WAR  [Illustration: Photograph - (signed) Let freedom win - D Lloyd George]                       THE WAR                  AFTER THE WAR                        BY                 ISAAC F.

TO                LORD NORTHCLIFFE            IN GRATEFUL APPRECIATION      _FOREWORD_   For nearly three years Europe has been drenched with blood and rent with bitter strife. Millions of men have been killed or maimed: billions of dollars in property have gone up in smoke and ruin--all part of the mighty sacrifice laid on the Altar of the Great War.  This tragic tumult must inevitably subside. The smoke of battle will clear: the scarred fields will mantle again with springtime verdure: the fighting hosts will once more find their way to peaceful pursuit. Time the Healer will wipe out the wounds of war.  The world already wearies of the Crimson Canvas splashed with martial scene. Heroism has become the most commonplace of qualities: it takes a monster thrill to move a civilisation sick of destruction. With eager eye it looks forward to the era of regeneration. War ends some time.  Business never ceases. Under the shock of mighty upheaval it has been dislocated by the most drastic strain ever put upon the economic fabric. But it will march on long after Peace will have mercifully sheathed the Sword. Therefore the permanent world problem is the Business problem.  This is why I made two trips to Europe: why I submit this little book in the hope that it may point the way to some realisation of the immense responsibilities which will inevitably crowd upon the world and more especially upon the United States.  Peace will be as great a shock as War. Hence the need of Preparedness to meet the inevitable conflict for Universal Trade. We--as a nation--are as unready for this emergency as we are to meet the clash of actual physical combat. Commercial Preparedness is as vital to the national well being as the Training for Arms.  Nor will Commerce be the only thing that we will have to reckon with. When you have heard the guns roar and watched horizons flame with fury and seen men go to their death smiling and unafraid; when the pitiless panorama of carnage has passed before you in terms of terror and tragedy, you realise that there is something human as well as economic in the relentless Thing called War.  It means that just as there was no compromise with dishonour in the approach to the Super-Struggle for which nations are pouring out their youth and fortune, so will there be no flinching in that coming contest for commercial mastery--the bloodless aftermath of History's deadliest and costliest war.  We have reached a place in the World Trade Sun. Unless we are ready to hold it we will slip into the Shadow.  We must prepare.                                                       I. F.

FROM PEDLAR TO PREMIER       258   THE WAR AFTER THE WAR     I--_The Coming War_   While the guns roar from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, and the greatest armed host that history has ever known is still locked in a life-and-death struggle on a dozen fronts, another war, more potent and permanent perhaps than the one which now engulfs Europe, lurks beyond the distant horizon of peace.  Its fighting line will be the boundaries of all human needs; its dynamic purpose a heroic rehabilitation after stupendous loss. It will be the far-flung struggle for the rich prize of International Trade, waiting at the end of the Crimson Lane that sooner or later will have a turning.  Embattled commercial groups will supplant embroiled nations; boycotts, discriminations and exclusions will succeed the strategies of line and trench; the animosities fought out to-day with shell and steel will have their heritage in ruthless rivalries.  How shall we fare in this tumult of tariff and treaty? Where shall we stand when the curtain of fire fades before a task of regeneration that will spell economic rebirth or disaster for millions? Will fiscal punishment be meted out to neutral and foe alike? Will reason rule or revenge dictate a costly reprisal in this war after the war?  These are the questions that rise out of the dust and din of the colossal upheaval which is rending half of the world. Directly or indirectly they touch the whole American people, regardless of rank or wealth. The tide of war has rolled us far upon the shores of world affairs. We have prospered in the kinship of the nations. Will the ebb of peace leave us high and dry amid a mighty isolation?  I went to England and France to study this problem at first hand. I interviewed Cabinet Ministers; I talked with lawmakers, soldiers, captains of capital, masters of industry, and plain, everyday business men. Often the talk was disturbed by shriek of shell or bomb of midnight Zeppelin marauder.  Through all the travail of debt and death that rends the allied peoples runs the clear current of determination to retrieve the immense loss. War is waste; some one must pay--we among the rest. Already the guns are being trained for the inevitable commercial battle, which, willingly or unwillingly, will bring us under fire. Let us examine the plan of campaign.  But before going into the concrete details that mean so much to our future and our fortune, it is important to understand some very essential conditions.  First and foremost is the uncertainty of the war itself. All prophecy--at best a dangerous thing--is purest speculation. No one can tell how long the duel will last; how badly the loser will be beaten; what the terms of peace will be. Yet out of these contingencies will emerge the strong hands that will redraw the trade map of the world. Whatever the outcome, the countries now fighting, especially the Allies, have definitely stated the principles that must govern--for a long time, at least--the whole realignment of commercial relations. Their way shall be the universal way.  In the second place, be you Ally or Teuton and regardless of how you may feel about the ethics of the Great Struggle, it must be remembered that behind the glamour as to whether it is waged to conserve human liberty, maintain the integrity of \"scraps of paper\" or to safeguard democracy, the larger fact remains that it is a war rooted in commercial jealousies and fanned by commercial aggressions.  Now we come to the really vital point, and it is this: When the guns are hushed you will find that national and industrial defence among the warring countries will be one and the same thing. The Allies learned to their cost that the economic advance of Germany was merely part of her one-time resistless military machine. Her trade and her preparedness went conqueringly hand in hand. Henceforth that game will be played by all. England, for instance, will manufacture dyestuffs not only for her textile trades, but because coal-tar products are essential to the making of high explosives.  Thus, Competition, which was once merely part of the natural progress of a country, will hereafter be a large part of the struggle for national existence.  There is still another factor: No matter who wins, peace must mean prosperity for everybody. For the victor it will take the form of an attempted stewardship of trade and navigation; for the vanquished it will be the dedication of a terrible energy to the twin restoration of pride and product.  Now you begin to see why it is up to the United States to make ready for whatever business fate awaits her beyond the uncertain frontiers of to-morrow. Nor have we been without warning of what may be in store for us. Prohibitive tariffs, blacklists and boycotts, embargoes on mail and cargo, the exclusion from England and France of hundreds of our manufactured articles--all show which way the international trade winds may blow when the belligerents begin to take toll of their losses. Meantime, what are the facts?  Take the case of England. Thirty years ago she was the workshop of the world. From the Tyne to the Thames her factories hummed with ceaseless industry. Her goods went wherever her ships steamed, and that meant the globe. Supreme in her insularity--at once her defence and her undoing--she became infected with the virus of content. Her steel was the best steel; her wares led all the rest. \"Take it or leave it!\" was her selling maxim. When devices came along that saved labour and increased production she refused to scrap the old to make way for the new. Born, too, was the evil of restricted output. Moss began to grow on her vaunted industrial structure. England lagged in the trade procession.  But as she lagged the assimilative German streamed in through her hospitable door. He served his apprenticeship in British mills; took home the secrets and methods of British art and craft. He geared them to cheap labour, harnessed product to masterful distribution, and became a World Power. Before long he had annexed the dye trade; was competing with British steel; was making once-cherished British goods.  What the German did in England he duplicated elsewhere. The world of ideas was his field and, with insatiate hunger, he garnered them in. He"]]]
