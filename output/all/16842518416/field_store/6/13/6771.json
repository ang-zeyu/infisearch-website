Two gentlemen started to capture him, and then a chase ensued.  Holländer tried to scamper up a picture, but tripped upon its glass, and fell.  At last, the Colonel captured him in an attempt to scale the curtains, and after much struggling, kicking, biting, and other vigorous protestations from Holländer, landed him safely in his cage.  The squirrels evidently enjoy country life very much.  Early this morning Minna took them out of doors, and removed the bottom of the cage that they might play upon the grass, which so much exhilarated them that I am convinced they fancied they were entirely free.  Then I removed the hot cotton from their little nest, and filled it with fresh clover-leaves, which I am sure they much prefer.  They run no risk of being devoured here, for Aunt Mary always disliked cats, so that there is not one upon the place, and Gabrielle's pet dog, a native of Bordeaux, has viewed them from afar, and snuffed at the cage, but is evidently too well-bred a Frenchman to desire even to tease them.   _June 14_.  A letter to-day from one of my Paris friends, Jennie Ford.  She says:  \"How divine it must be at Chappaqua!  I am glad you are enjoying yourself, and are well.  But you do not say a word of your Western trip.  I hope you have not given it up.\"  Then follows a cordial invitation for me to visit her in her beautiful home upon Lake Erie, now looking its prettiest in the leafy month of June.  All sorts of pleasant inducements are held out: a croquet-lawn of velvet softness, long drives, and charming rides in which to display my stylish new beaver and habit, moonlight excursions upon Lake Erie, and no lack of handsome cavaliers, including naval officers.  However, despite all these attractions, I do not think I shall care to leave Chappaqua this summer.  Jennie enclosed a photograph of the lady who reigned as belle of the American colony in Paris, some four or five years ago--Mrs. Horace Jenness, then Miss Carrie Deming.  Three years of married life have changed the beautiful Carrie somewhat, if this picture is a truthful one.  The perfect outline of her face is unaltered, but the haughty expression that \"La Princesse\" wore in former days has vanished, and the fond young mother, grouped with her two little children is prettier than ever.   _June 15_.  I feel singularly indolent, and indisposed to journalize this evening. Perhaps it is the result of two hours spent in croquet, a game in which I am very unproficient and therefore find decidedly wearisome; but Gabrielle, who is the best croquet player in Chappaqua, is in the city to-day, and my feeble assistance was necessary to make up the quartette.  Two entire hours spent in this game seem quite an unwarrantable loss of time, but we have had a guest from New York to-day, and therefore both Plato and Kohlrausch have remained under lock and key in the library.  I think no one enjoys the country more thoroughly than a physician when he can escape from his patients for a holiday, and Dr. Howe, our visitor of to-day, was not an exception.  This gentleman is, I fancy, quite young in his profession, for his figure is of almost boyish slenderness; his face, too, which reminds one somewhat of Shelley in its delicacy and brightness, and its dark eyes and luxuriant curls, is quite youthful for a fully fledged M.D.  Dr. Howe returned from Europe some months since, and brought us a letter of introduction from a friend of mamma's in Florence; but owing to mamma's long illness and the seclusion in which we lived last winter, we have not seen him many times.  I have in my lap a number of letters received in this evening's mail. One is from my dear friend, Mrs. Knox, the charming contralto of Christ Church.  We had expected her to visit us this week, but her unexpected departure for the West has prevented her from doing so.  She says:  \"You must truly be enjoying Chappaqua these heavenly June days.  I hope that the fresh air and rest are putting roses into your pale cheeks and giving you health and strength for your literary labors.  My sudden departure compels me to forego the pleasure I had anticipated in seeing you at Chappaqua--at least until the fall.  I am appreciative of the courtesy of your dear mamma in inviting me to spend a day in that lovely retreat, already made sacred to me by my high regard and admiration for your most noble uncle, whose home it was.\"  Another letter is written upon most dainty stationery, bearing the impress of Tiffany, and adorned with a prettily devised monogram in lavender and gold (handsome stationery is one of my weaknesses).  This letter I know to be sprightly and amusing before I open it, for my friend Lela has been for two or three years one of my most entertaining correspondents.  We were intimate friends in Paris three or four years ago, when Lela was a school-girl, and I an _enfant de Marie_, and although we have been separated by hundreds of miles, by the ocean, and finally, by Lela's marriage, our attachment continues; so, no reproaches upon school-girl friendships, I beg.  Lela was married last winter, but she and her handsome French husband are yet in the honeymoon, which will last, I fancy, forever--certainly the former Queen of Hearts seems now to care for only _one_ heart.  She says:  \"You must be having a lovely time in such a charming place.  We have been to Saratoga.  It was stupid enough to send your worst enemy there.\"   _June 17_.  This week has been quite lost, so far as study is concerned, for nearly every day has been interrupted by visitors.  Looking out of the window this morning, I saw a carriage containing two strange young ladies stop before the house.  In answer to their inquiry for Miss Greeley and Miss Gabrielle, Minna informed them, in her broken English, that they were both in the city for the day.  They looked quite aghast upon receiving this information, for they had already dismissed their carriage, in which they had driven from Pleasantville, and knew probably that there was no down train till 4.45, so quite helplessly they inquired if _no_ members of the family were at home. Learning that Mrs. Cleveland and her daughters were here, one of the young ladies, a stylish girl in mourning, desired Minna to announce Miss Hempstead and her cousin.  I puzzled a little over the name while glancing in the mirror to see that my crape ruffle was properly adjusted, and my hair in tolerable order.  The name seemed familiar, and yet I knew that no friend of mine bore it.  I found the young ladies in the music room.  Miss Hempstead introduced herself by saying:  \"Perhaps you may have heard my name, although you do not know me.  My brother was a friend of Mrs. and Miss Greeley, and was purser of the _Missouri_.\"  I was then somewhat surprised that I had not divined Miss Hempstead's identity from the name and her black dress; but the burning of the _Missouri_ made scarce any impression upon me at the time, surrounded as I was last fall by such heavy family afflictions; and the name of the young purser, whose tragic fate then filled the newspapers, had since then almost entirely passed from my memory.  An ordinary passenger ship is wrecked or burned, \"Extras\" are issued, a three days' excitement follows, and it is then a thing of the past; but as the _Missouri_ bore, on this memorable voyage, not indeed Caesar and his fortunes, but the supposed _fiancé_ of dear Ida, its loss is an event still interesting to the gossiping public.  It was useless to try to convince any one that no engagement had ever existed between Mr. Hempstead and Ida: no one would credit my most solemn protestations. Many people not personally acquainted with us, but who knew the facts \"upon the best authority,\" as outsiders usually do, said that the marriage was to have taken place before the election, but after Aunt Mary's death it was postponed for three months.  Before two weeks had elapsed, however, Mr. Hempstead was, in the poetic language of the journals, \"sleeping beneath the coral wave,\" and poor Ida received as many well-meant condolences over his death as over Aunt Mary's.  When the tragedy of last autumn was all over, the interest of the public was greater than ever, and Ida, \"who had within four short weeks lost mother, lover, and father,\" formed the subject of many a pathetic editorial and sermon.  A London journal styled Ida the \"maiden widow,\" spoke of uncle's fond attachment to Mr. Hempstead, and announced that the loss of his prospective son-in-law was an affliction that precipitated Mr. Greeley's death.  I first heard of Mr. Hempstead in the winter of 1869-70.  Aunt Mary, who was then commencing to fail, went with Ida to Nassau to spend the cold months.  Her state-room, engaged at the last moment, was a very uncomfortable one, and Mr. Hempstead, then purser of the _Eagle_, gave up for her use a large deck state-room with three windows--a great comfort to Aunt Mary, who was always so partial to an airy bedroom. The "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],["title","The Story of a Summer (#6)"],["body","proved, however, a very stormy one, and the waves dashed in through these three windows, quite drenching poor Ida, who suffered so much from sea-sickness as to be quite indifferent to danger or discomfort.  In writing to me after reaching Nassau, Ida mentioned Mr. Hempstead in a few words:  \"The purser was an agreeable and gentlemanly officer, and so kind to mamma.\"  She did not, however, mention his name, and I never knew it till last summer.  After their return to New York, in the spring of 1870, Aunt Mary invited Mr. Hempstead to visit them at Chappaqua, as she felt under some obligations to him for having given her his state-room, and subsequently executed some little commissions for her, between New York and Nassau.  He came out here, and made a visit of a week.  In July of the same year.  Aunt Mary and Ida went abroad, and from that time the acquaintance dropped.  That he admired Ida know, but how any one could manufacture an engagement from such slight material, I cannot imagine.  One day last summer, during the excitement of the campaign, I had taken up a rose-tinted society journal as a little respite from politics, when my eyes fell upon a paragraph announcing Ida's engagement to Mr. William Hempstead, Purser of the _Missouri_; and then I for the first time learnt the officer's name.  My astonishment can be imagined; and to this day it remains an enigma who invented that little society item. If a fertile-minded reporter had desired to head his column of Engagements in High Life with Ida's name, and had announced that she would shortly be led to the hymeneal altar (I believe that is the correct phrase in newspaper parlance) by any one in our circle of acquaintances with whom she was at all intimate, it would not have been surprising; but why a person whom she had not seen or heard of for two years should have been selected, is a mystery worthy of G. P. R. James.  But in writing about Mr. Hempstead, I have neglected his sister.  Miss Hempstead was a tall, fine-looking young girl, with, however, a strikingly foreign appearance for an American _pur sang_.  She was born, she told me, in Belize, Central America, where her father was United States Consul.  A tropical sun had given her a complexion of Spanish darkness, heightened by large black eyes and jet black hair--the exact counterpart, Ida afterwards told me, of her brother, who was often mistaken for a Cuban.  When the period of the consulate of Mr. Hempstead père was over, he had become so much attached to Belize, that he decided to make it his future residence.  His daughter said she could not imagine what he found to like in the place, for between earthquakes and yellow fever, one was in a continual state of terror; there was no society, the population being almost entirely negro, and no schools; consequently the children of the few white resident families were obliged to go to England or to the United States to be educated.  Miss Hempstead was sent to London, and five or six years of the discipline of a first-class English school have made her quite different from the fully fledged society queens who graduate from our Murray Hill _pensionnats_ at sixteen or so.  A little English reserve to tone down somewhat their sparkling natures is all that our bewitching American girls need to make them perfect, but I fear they will for several years yet bear the stigma of, \"Charming, but too wild.\"     CHAPTER V.  Sunday in the Country--Proximity of a Meeting-house--How we pass our Sundays--The House in the Woods--Ida's Glen--Mrs. Greeley's Favorite Spring--The Children's Play-house--Gabrielle's Pets--Travelling in 1836--New York Society--Mr. Greeley's Friday Evenings--Mrs. Greeley as a Bride--Her Accomplishments--A Letter concerning Mr. Greeley's Wedding.   _June 16_.  Sunday is, I think, a very _triste_ day in the country (low be it spoken).  I cannot remain longer than an hour at church, for the Mass is a low one, and the sermon consists of fifteen minutes of plain, practical instruction, unembellished by rhetoric, to the congregation. The church, it is true, is four miles distant, but Gabrielle's aristocratic ponies, Lady Alice and The Duchess, fairly fly over the ground--up or down hill, it is immaterial to them--and consequently, I find myself, when my religious duties are over, with many idle hours upon my hands.  The croquet balls and mallets, our \"Magic Rings,\" and other out-of-door games, are put away in the \"children's play-house,\" a little white hut on the borders of the croquet ground, where Ida and dear little Raffie used to keep their toys, and where Gabrielle in later days housed her menagerie of pets.  The piano, too, is not only closed, but locked, for the flesh is weak, and I fear the temptation of the beautiful cold keys.  It may be the baneful effect of a foreign education, but I cannot see that there would be any evil result from a little music on Sundays.  However, we have a Dissenting church for a next-door neighbor, and the residents of Chappaqua are chiefly Quakers, who frown upon the piano as an ungodly instrument; so with a sigh, I replace in my portfolio that grand hymn that in 1672 saved the life of the singer, Stradella, from the assassin's knife, and a beautiful Ave Maria, solemn and chaste in its style as though written by St. Gregory himself, but composed and dedicated to me by mamma's friend, Professor F. L. Ritter.  My pretty bits of fancy work with their bright-colored silks, the tiny needle-book worked while in Munich in an especially pretty stitch, and in the Bavarian colors--blue and white--and my Bavarian thimble--silver and amethyst--are put away in a bureau drawer, for although a Catholic, I do not imitate our Lutheran maid, who spends her Sundays in sewing and knitting.  Plato and Kohlrausch, our week-day sustenance, do not come certainly under the head of Sunday reading, although I see nothing objectionable in them; but after all, one requires, I think, a change of literature on Sundays as well as a different dress, and an extra course at dinner.  \"What shall we do?\" says Gabrielle.  We have each written a letter or two, for Sunday is, I am sure, every one's letter-writing day, and now we put on our broad-brimmed garden hats, with their graceful trimmings of gauze and crape, and stroll off to the spicy pine grove, where we sit down on the dry spines, and Arthur repeats to us quaint bits from some of the rare old books he read in the British Museum three years ago, or entertains us with some of his own adventures when travelling on foot over beautiful France and Italy, and \"Merrie England.\"  Ida and I, however, wandered away from the others this morning, and strolled up to the dear old house in the woods where she passed her childhood.  This is, to my mind, the sweetest and most picturesque spot upon the entire estate, and I do not wonder that Aunt Mary, with her keen love for the beautiful in Nature, her indifference to general society, and her devotion to her children, to study, and to reflection, preferred the quiet seclusion of her home shut in by evergreens, with the deep ravine, and the joyous little brook at her feet, to the most superb mansion that graces our magnificent Hudson.  [Illustration: The House in the Woods.]  One of the purest springs on the place is in the ravine, or \"Ida's Glen,\" as uncle christened it long ago.  Here at the foot of the long wooden staircase is a basin of natural rock, and flowing into it is the sweetest, coolest water in the world.  This water Aunt Mary always preferred to any other on the place--even to the spring at the foot of the side-hill, so celebrated in the campaign times as the spot where uncle and his visitors would stop to \"take a drink,\" when returning from a walk.  Exquisite in her neatness, Aunt Mary would frequently order the basin of her favorite spring to be well purified by a thorough scrubbing with brush and soap, followed by a prolonged rinsing with water.  During her illness last fall, she frequently asked to have a pitcher of water brought from this spring, which she always especially relished.  That uncle shared his wife's partiality for this spring is evident by his description of it in his \"Recollections\":  \"In the little dell or glen through which my brook emerges from the wood wherein it has brawled down the hill, to dance across a gentle slope to the swamp below, is _the_ spring,--pure as crystal, never-failing, cold as you could wish it for drink in the hottest day, and so thoroughly shaded and sheltered that, I am confident, it was never warm, and never frozen over.  Many springs upon my farm are excellent, but this is peerless.\"  The house in the woods was built by uncle to suit Aunt Mary's taste, and very comfortable and complete it is.  Uncle says of it:  \"It is not much--hastily erected, small, slight, and wooden, it has at length been almost deserted for one recently purchased and refitted on the edge of the village; but the cottage in the woods is still my home, where my books remain, and where I mean to garner my treasures.\"  The house consists of two stories with that most necessary addition to a country house, a broad piazza.  To the right stands a white cottage, built for the servants.  Almost in front of the house is a large boulder, moss-grown and venerable.  This, Aunt Mary would not have removed, for she loved Nature in its wildest primeval beauty, and now the rock is associated with loving memories of Raffie's little hands that once prepared fairy banquets upon it, with acorn-cups for dishes; but now those baby hands have long since been folded quietly in the grave.  The little play-house, that has since been removed to the croquet-ground, once stood not far from this rock, and has been used, as I said, by Gabrielle as a menagerie for her pets.  A strange assortment they often were for a little girl.  Inheriting her mother's exquisite tenderness of feeling towards helpless animals, Gabrielle would splinter and bandage up the "]]]
