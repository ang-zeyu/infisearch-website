Captain Passford gave no heed to the movement of the vessel, but for several minutes planked the deck as though he were unable to realize the truth or the force of the news he had hastily gathered from the head-lines of the newspaper.  At last he halted in the waist, at some distance from the other members of his family, raised his paper, and fixed his gaze upon the staring announcement at the head of one of its columns. No one ventured to approach him; for he was the magnate of the vessel, and, whatever his humor, he was entitled to the full benefit of it.  He only glanced at the head-lines as he had done before, and then dropped the paper, as though the announcement he had read was all he desired to know.  \"Beeks,\" said he, as a quartermaster passed near him.  The man addressed promptly halted, raised his hand to his cap, and waited the pleasure of the owner of the steamer.  \"Tell Captain Breaker that I wish to see him, if you please,\" added Captain Passford.  The man repeated the name of the person he was to call, and hastened away to obey the order. The owner resumed his march across the deck, though it was evident to the anxious observers that he had in a great measure recovered his self-possession, for his movements were less nervous, and the usual placid calm was restored to his face.  In another minute, Captain Breaker, who was the actual commander of the vessel, appeared in the waist, and walked up to his owner. Though not more than forty-five years old, his hair and full beard were heavily tinted with gray; and an artist who wished for an ideal shipmaster, who was both a gentleman and a sailor, could not have found a better representative of this type in the merchant or naval service, or on the deck of the finest steam-yacht in the world.  \"You sent for me, Captain Passford,\" said the commander, in respectful but not subservient tones.  \"You will take the steamer to some point off Fire Island, and come to anchor there,\" replied the owner, as, without any explanation, he walked away from the spot.  \"Off Fire Island,\" added Captain Breaker, simply repeating the name of the locality to which his order related, but not in a tone that required an exclamation-point to express his surprise.  Whatever the captain of the Bellevite thought or felt, it was an extraordinary order which he received. It was in the month of April, and the vessel had been absent about five months on her winter pleasure cruise.  In a few hours more the yacht could easily be at her moorings off Bonnydale on the Hudson; but when almost in sight of New York, the captain had been ordered to anchor, as though the owner had no intention of returning to his elegant home.  If he was surprised, as doubtless he was, he did not manifest it in the slightest degree; for he was a sailor, and it was a part of his gospel to obey the orders of his owner without asking any questions.  No doubt he thought of his wife and children as he walked forward to the pilot-house to execute his order, for he had been away from them for a long time. The three papers brought on board by the pilot had all been given to the owner, and he had no hint of the startling news they contained.  The course of the Bellevite was promptly changed more to the northward; and if the pilot wished to be informed in regard to this strange alteration in the immediate destination of the vessel, Captain Breaker was unable to give him any explanation.  Captain Passford was evidently himself again; and he did not rush across the deck as he had done before, but seated himself in an armchair he had occupied before the pilot came on board, and proceeded to read something more than the headlines in the paper.  He hardly moved or looked up for half an hour, so intensely was he absorbed in the narrative before him. Mrs. Passford and Christy, though even more excited by the singular conduct of the owner, and the change in the course of the steamer, did not venture to interrupt him.  The owner took the other two papers from his pocket, and had soon possessed himself of all the details of the astounding news; and it was plain enough to those who so eagerly observed his expression as he read, that he was impressed as he had never been before in his life.  Before the owner had finished the reading of the papers, the Bellevite had reached the anchorage chosen by the pilot, and the vessel was soon fast to the bottom in a quiet sea.  \"The tide is just right for going up to the city,\" said the pilot, who had left his place in the pilot-house, and addressed himself to the owner in the waist.  \"But we shall not go up to the city,\" replied Captain Passford, in a very decided tone. \"But that shall make no difference in your pilot's fees.--Captain Breaker.\"  The captain of the steamer, who had also come out of the pilot-house, had stationed himself within call of the owner to receive the next order, which might throw some light on the reason for anchoring the steamer so near her destination on a full sea. He presented himself before the magnate of the yacht, and indicated that he was ready to take his further orders.  \"You will see that the pilot is paid his full fee for taking the vessel to a wharf,\" continued Captain Passford.  The captain bowed, and started towards the companionway; but the owner called him back.  \"I see what looks like a tug to the westward of us. You will set the signal to bring her alongside,\" the magnate proceeded.  This order was even more strange than that under which the vessel had come to anchor so near home after her long cruise; but the captain asked no questions, and made no sign. Calling Beeks, he went aft with the pilot, and paid him his fees.  When the American flag was displayed in the fore-rigging for the tug, Captain Passford, with his gaze fixed on the planks of the deck, walked slowly to the place where his wife was seated, and halted in front of her without speaking a word. But there was a quivering of the lip which assured the lady and her son that he was still struggling to suppress his agitation.  \"What is the matter, Horatio?\" asked the wife, in the tenderest of tones, while her expression assured those who saw her face that the anxiety of the husband had been communicated to the wife.  \"I need hardly tell you, Julia, that I am disturbed as I never was before in all my life,\" replied he, maintaining his calmness only with a struggle.  \"I can see that something momentous has happened in our country,\" she added, hardly able to contain herself, for she felt that she was in the presence of an unexplained calamity.  \"Something has happened, my dear; something terrible,--something that I did not expect, though many others were sure that it would come,\" he continued, seating himself at the side of his wife.  \"But you do not tell me what it is,\" said the lady, with a look which indicated that her worst fears were confirmed. \"Is Florry worse? Is she\"--  \"So far as I know, Florry is as well as usual,\" interposed the husband. \"But a state of war exists at the present moment between the North and the South.\"     CHAPTER II  THE BROTHER AT THE SOUTH   Even five months before, when the Bellevite had sailed on her cruise, the rumble of coming events had been heard in the United States; and it had been an open question whether or not war would grow out of the complications between the North and the South.  Only a few letters, and fewer newspapers, had reached the owner of the yacht; and he and his family on board had been very indifferently informed in regard to the progress of political events at home. Captain Passford was one of those who confidently believed that no very serious difficulty would result from the entanglements into which the country had been plunged by the secession of the most of the Southern States.  He would not admit even to himself that war was possible; and before his departure he had scouted the idea of a conflict with arms between the brothers of the North and the brothers of the South, as he styled them.  Captain Passford had been the master of a ship in former times, though he had accumulated his vast fortune after he abandoned the sea. His father was an Englishman, who had come to the United States as a young man, had married, raised his two sons, and died in the city of New York.  These two sons, Horatio and Homer, were respectively forty-five and forty years of age. Both of them were married, and each of them had only a son and a daughter. While Horatio had been remarkably successful in his pursuit of wealth in the metropolis, he had kept himself clean and honest, like so many of the wealthy men of the great city. When he retired from active business, he settled at Bonnydale on the Hudson.  His brother had been less successful as a business-man, and soon after his marriage to a Northern lady he had purchased a plantation in Alabama, where both of his children had been born, and where he was a man of high standing, with wealth enough to maintain his position in luxury, though his fortune was insignificant compared with that of his brother.  Between the two brothers and their families the most kindly relations had always existed; and each made occasional visits to the other, though the distance which separated them was too great to permit of very frequent exchanges personally of brotherly love and kindness.  Possibly the fraternal feeling which subsisted between the two brothers had some influence upon the opinions of Horatio, for to him hostilities meant making war upon his only brother, whom he cherished as warmly as if they had not been separated by a distance of over a thousand miles.  He measured the feelings of others by his own; and if all had felt as he felt, war would have been an impossibility, however critical and momentous the relations between the two sections.  Though his father had been born and bred in England, Horatio was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18579"],["title","Taken (#2)"],["body","intensely American than thousands who came out of Plymouth Rock stock; and he believed in the union of the States, unable to believe that any true citizen could tolerate the idea of a separation of any kind.  The first paper which Captain Passford read on the deck of the Bellevite contained the details of the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter; and the others, a record of the events which had transpired in the few succeeding days after the news of actual war reached the North.  This terrible intelligence was unexpected to the owner of the yacht, believing, as he had, in the impossibility of war; and it seemed to him just as though he and his cherished brother were already arrayed against each other on the battle-field.  The commotion between the two sections had begun before his departure from home on the yacht cruise, but his brother, perhaps because he was fully instructed in regard to the Union sentiment of Horatio, was strangely reticent, and expressed no opinions of his own.  But Captain Passford, measuring his brother according to his own standard, was fully persuaded that Homer was as sound on the great question as he was himself, though the excitement and violence around him might have caused him to maintain a neutral position.  Certainly if the Northern brother had anticipated that a terrible war was impending, he would not have permitted his daughter Florence, a beautiful young lady of seventeen, to reside during the winter in a hot-bed of secession and disunion. The papers informed him what had been done at the North and at the South to initiate the war; and the thought that Florry was now in the midst of the enemies of her country was agonizing to him.  Though he felt that his country demanded his best energies, and though he was ready and willing to give himself and his son to her in her hour of need, he felt that his first duty was to his own family, within reasonable limits; and his earliest thoughts were directed to the safety of his daughter, and then to the welfare of his brother and his family.  \"War!\" exclaimed Mrs. Passford, when her husband had announced so briefly the situation which had caused such intense agitation in his soul. \"What do you mean by war, Horatio?\"  \"I mean all that terrible word can convey of destruction and death, and, worse yet, of hate and revenge between brothers of the same household!\" replied the husband impressively. \"Both the North and the South are sounding the notes of preparation. Men are gathering by thousands on both sides, soon to meet on fields which must be drenched in the gore of brothers.\"  \"But don't you think the trouble will be settled in some way, Horatio?\" asked the anxious wife and mother; and her thoughts, like those of her husband, reverted to the loving daughter then in the enemy's camp.  \"I do not think so; that is impossible now. I did not believe that war was possible: now I do not believe it will be over till one side or the other shall be exhausted,\" replied Captain Passford, wiping from his brow the perspiration which the intensity of his emotion produced. \"A civil war is the most bitter and terrible of all wars.\"  \"I cannot understand it,\" added the lady.  \"Is it really war, sir?\" asked Christy, who had been an interested listener to all that had been said.  \"It is really war, my son,\" replied the father earnestly. \"It will be a war which cannot be carried to a conclusion by hirelings; but father, son, and brother must take part in it, against father, son, and brother.\"  \"It is terrible to think of,\" added Mrs. Passford with something like a shudder, though she was a strong-minded woman in the highest sense of the words.  Captain Passford then proceeded to inform his wife and son in regard to all the events which had transpired since he had received his latest papers at Bermuda. They listened with the most intense interest, and the trio were as solemn as though they had met to consider the dangerous illness of the absent member of the family.  The owner did not look upon the impending war as a sort of frolic, as did many of the people at the North and the South, and he could not regard it as a trivial conflict which would be ended in a few weeks or a few months. To him it was the most terrible reality which his imagination could picture; and more clearly than many eminent statesmen, he foresaw that it would be a long and fierce encounter.  \"From what you say, Horatio, I judge that the South is already arming for the conflict,\" said Mrs. Passford, after she had heard her husband's account of what had occurred on shore.  \"The South has been preparing for war for months, and the North began to make serious preparation for coming events as soon as Fort Sumter fell. Doubtless the South is better prepared for the event to-day than the North, though the greater population and vast resources of the latter will soon make up for lost time,\" replied the captain.  \"And Florry is right in the midst of the gathering armies of the South,\" added the fond mother, wiping a tear from her eyes.  \"She is; and, unless something is done at once to restore her to her home, she may have to remain in the enemy's country for months, if not for years,\" answered the father, with a slight trembling of the lips.  \"But what can be done?\" asked the mother anxiously.  \"The answer to that question has agitated me more than any thing else which has come to my mind for years, for I cannot endure the thought of leaving her even a single month at any point which is as likely as any other to become a battle-field in a few days or a few weeks,\" continued Captain Passford, with some return of the agitation which had before shaken him so terribly.  \"Of course your brother Homer will take care of her,\" said the terrified mother, as she gazed earnestly into the expressive face of the stout-hearted man before her.  \"Certainly he will do all for Florry that he would do for his own children, but he may not long be able to save his own family from the horrors of war.\"  \"Do you think she will be in any actual danger, Horatio?\"  \"I have no doubt she will be as safe at Glenfield, if the conflict were raging there, as she would be at Bonnydale under the same circumstances. From the nature of the case, the burden of the fighting, the havoc and desolation, will be within the Southern States, and few, if any, of the battle-fields will be on Northern soil, or at least as far north as our home.\"  \"From what I have seen of the people near the residence of your brother, they are neither brutes nor savages,\" added the lady.  \"No more than the people of the North; but war rouses the brute nature of most men, and there will be brutes and savages on both sides, from the very nature of the case.\"  \"In his recent letters, I mean those that came before we sailed from home, Homer did not seem to take part with either side in the political conflict; and in those which came to us at the Azores and Bermuda, he did not say a single word to indicate whether he is a secessionist, or in favor of the Union. Do you know how he stands, Horatio?\"  \"My means of knowing are the same as yours, and I can be no wiser than you are on this point, though I have my opinion,\" replied Captain Passford.  \"What is your opinion?\"  \"That he is as truly a Union man as I am.\"  \"I am glad that he is.\"  \"I do not say that he is a Union man; but judging from his silence, and what I know of him, I think he is. And it is as much a part of my desire and intention to bring him and his family out of the enemy's country as it is to recover Florry.\"  \"Then we shall have them all at Bonnydale this summer?\" suggested Mrs. Passford. \"Nothing could suit me better.\"  \"Though I am fully persuaded in my own mind that Homer will be true to his country in this emergency, I may be mistaken. He has lived for many years at the South, and has been identified with the institutions of that locality, as I have been with those of the North. Though we both love the land of our fathers on the other side of the ocean, we have both been strongly American. As he always believed in the whole country as a unit, I shall expect him to be more than willing to stand by his country as it was, and as it should be.\"  \"I hope you will find him so, but I am grievously sorry that Florry is not with us.\"  \"Tug-boat alongside, Captain Passford,\" said the commander.  The owner of the Bellevite wished the tug to wait his orders.     CHAPTER III  DANGEROUS AND SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR   In various parts of the deck of the Bellevite, the officers, seamen, engineers, and coal-passers of the steamer were gathered in knots, evidently discussing the situation; for the news brought on board by the pilot had been spread through the ship.  Captain Passford hardly noticed the announcement made to him by the commander, that the tug was alongside, for he was not yet ready to make use of it. Even the wife and the son of the owner wondered what the mission of the little vessel was to be; but the husband and father had not yet disclosed his purpose in coming to anchor almost in sight of his own mansion.  \"Why have you come to anchor here, Horatio?\" asked Mrs. Passford, taking advantage of the momentary pause in the interesting, and even exciting, conversation, to put this leading question.  \"I was about to tell you. I have already adopted my plan to recover Florry, and bring my brother and his family out of the enemy's country,\" replied the owner, looking with some solicitude into the face of his wife, as though he anticipated some objection to his plan.  \"You have adopted it so quick?\" inquired the lady. \"You have not had much time to think of it.\"  \"I have had all the time I need to enable me to reach the decision to rescue my child from peril, and save my brother and his family from privation and trouble in the enemy's country. But I have only decided what to do, and I have yet to mature the details of the scheme.\"  \"I hope you are not going into any danger,\" added the wife anxiously. "]]]
