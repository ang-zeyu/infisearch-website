The signals made by the naval officer were not loud, and the replies, made without the aid of any instrument, were quite feeble. One might have taken them for some frolic on the part of the boys.  \"I don't quite understand this business,\" said Major Pierson, after he had listened a while to the signals. \"I suppose from the answers you get, that your men are all along the river, and the woods seem to be full of them.\"  \"I have no doubt they are all here,\" replied Captain Carboneer. \"I have been in this vicinity all day, and I have made good use of my time. I believe the Bellevite belongs to the Confederacy, and it shall be no fault of mine if the goods are not delivered in good order and condition.\"  \"My father was confident that he should obtain her at Nassau, though he was mistaken,\" added the major.  \"But when she went within our lines, we were all satisfied that she was ours. I have not yet been able to understand why she was permitted to escape.\"  \"If you mean by that to cast any blame upon those who did their best to prevent her escape, Captain Carboneer, you wrong them grossly,\" said Major Pierson. \"She came on a friendly visit to the plantation of Colonel Passford; but this gentleman, though the owner of the steamer was his own brother, promptly gave information of her presence in the creek, and did all he could to have her captured. No man could have sacrificed more to his patriotism than he did.\"  \"I do not reflect on him or on any one; I only wonder how the Bellevite contrived to escape when several steamers were sent out to capture her,\" added the captain.  \"The son of the owner of the Bellevite was a prisoner of mine, for when I had my brother arrested for desertion, this young man was with him. The only mistake I made was in not putting him in irons. The captain of my tug proved to be a traitor to the Confederacy, and this fellow, with Christy Passford, did the most of the mischief in preventing the capture of the steamer.\"  \"I was told that he was a smart boy,\" added the naval officer.  \"He is all of that; and I think it was very fortunate that he did not happen to be at home when we visited the Bellevite just now,\" said Major Pierson, who evidently had a proper respect for the abilities of the millionnaire's son.  \"I do not see that his presence in his father's mansion, if he had been there, could have made any difference,\" added the captain, as he sounded his whistle again, and heard a faint response from the shore. \"As long as he was not actually on board of the steamer, he was harmless.\"  \"Perhaps he was, though I have the feeling that it would have been otherwise. There was a whistle from the shore.\"  \"I heard it, and I understand it. Haslett has done his whole duty, I judge,\" replied Captain Carboneer.  \"Who is Haslett?\" asked the major curiously. \"I never heard of him before.\"  \"He is to be the first lieutenant of the Bellevite.\"  \"You seem to have a full supply of officers and men, Captain Carboneer,\" added Major Pierson, apparently a little disconcerted. \"I do not see that I am of the least use here, for you seem to have done everything without consulting me.\"  \"In naval matters I have; but I give you full credit for the planning of the enterprise,\" replied the captain, in his softest tones.  \"When I was removed from my command because I allowed the steamer to pass the forts, I felt that a great injustice had been done to me. I did all I could to effect the capture of the vessel, but the attempt was a failure,\" argued the major. \"The shot hole through the bow of the Belle utterly wrecked her, and the force on board of her could do nothing, and Christy Passford had brought my own tug to bear against me. Why, the Bellevite actually saved the force on board of the Belle from drowning. A violent gale came up, and that did a great deal to nullify all our efforts. But I think I did my whole duty.\"  \"I have no doubt of it, Major Pierson; and for that reason you were sent on this mission; and I am confident that the success of the enterprise will restore you to your former command, or give you another quite as good,\" said Captain Carboneer, as consolation to the military arm of the expedition.  \"But I cannot see that I have been of any use to this enterprise, and I might as well have staid at home.\"  \"You are too modest by half, major. You planned the expedition, and suggested that Corny should take part in it, as he would have the _entr√©e_ to the residence of Captain Passford. But, being a mere boy, he could not be sent alone, and your services were likely to be of the most important character. It is no fault of yours that we found everything made ready for us, as it were. It might have been quite different, and the burden of the action might have rested upon you. It is all right as it is.\"  \"I am satisfied,\" added the major, \"though I think it was no more than right that you should have consulted me in regard to your methods, of which I am still profoundly ignorant. In getting up the scheme, I based everything on the fact that Corny could go into his uncle's house and obtain all the information we needed.\"  \"The scheme was well concocted; and I shall have the pleasure of reporting to the government that the military arm of the expedition conducted the enterprise to a perfect success, the naval force only doing the duty pointed out by the military.\"  \"You are very kind, Captain Carboneer,\" said Major Pierson, who could not well help being entirely satisfied, and even greatly pleased, with this happy showing of the final result.  \"By daylight in the morning we shall be outside of Sandy Hook, I expect. We have no time to waste, and you can see for yourself how the affair of the young lady would have complicated our operations.\"  \"How do you intend to convey these men, who seem to be scattered all along the shores of the river, to the steamer?\"  \"They understand my signals, and they will all be ready within an hour to take a small steamer which will pick them up.\"  \"But where is the steamer?\"  \"She is farther down the river. As you seem to be a little sensitive to the fact that I have not consulted you in regard to the naval operations of this enterprise, I can tell you in a few words all there is of them,\" continued Captain Carboneer. \"As you are aware, as soon as our plan was matured by you, I left Mobile with Lieutenant Haslett, though you knew nothing about him, for Nassau. We had no difficulty in getting out of the bay, for the blockade was not then enforced. At Nassau I engaged a couple of English engineers, and a few other officers, with thirty seamen, mostly English, who were looking for prize-money. I had to take my force to Quebec, for no steamer offered for New York. I sent them all here in small parties, and Haslett posted them along the river when I told him they would be needed to-night.\"  \"I did not leave Mobile till two weeks later with Corny,\" added the major. \"But I got here sooner than you did.\"  \"You were more fortunate in finding a steamer. I believe I have a capital crew, though I shall obtain more men at Bermuda, or some other port. There are plenty of good English sailors who are willing to fight on either side if there is a good showing for prize-money; and I have no doubt I shall capture a dozen vessels before we reach the Bermudas, which will fully satisfy them, especially as the government will pay the value of all vessels we are compelled to burn on the high seas.\"  \"You will have the advantage over everything that floats, for I was told that the Bellevite made twenty knots an hour, and had done twenty-two,\" said Major Pierson. \"At what time do you think you will get on board of the steamer?\"  \"By one or two in the morning, I hope; but it will depend upon the steamer Haslett engages, though he told me he had bargained for an old one with a walking-beam; but that will answer our purpose. I believe he had to buy her, though she was of no great value.\"  At a creek which appeared to be the rendezvous of the conspirators, the boat left the river; but there was no steamer, though quite a number of men had gathered there. Leaving the party in the boat to follow out the remaining details of their enterprise, which, by this time, in the absence of anything like an obstacle, they regarded as so many mere formalities, it becomes necessary to make another visit to the mansion of Captain Passford. This gentleman had gone to the city upon important business connected with the fitting out of the Bellevite, and he had not returned when the clock in the great hall struck ten, which was at about the time Captain Carboneer and his companions went into the creek five miles down the river.  \"There is no knowing when your father will come home, Florry,\" said Mrs. Passford, as she suspended her work on a stocking she was knitting for the soldiers. \"But I can't imagine what has become of Christy. He never stays out as late as this unless he tells us of it beforehand.\"  \"I am really worried about him, mother,\" replied the beautiful daughter, looking up from the stocking on which she was employed. \"He went away in the Florence, and something may have happened to him.\"  \"I think not, Florry: there has been no storm, or heavy blow, and he thinks he is as safe in his boat as he is on shore,\" added Mrs. Passford, with an effort to control the fears of the daughter. \"He may have gone down to the city. He is very indignant at the delay in giving the order to have the steamer sent to the navy yard, and wherever he is, I am confident he is doing something in connection with the steamer.\"  \"I wish I knew whether the Florence was at the boathouse,\" continued Florry. \"He said he was going out in the boat; but perhaps he did not. Perhaps he is with father.\"  \"There is the front-door bell,\" added Mrs. Passford, with a start. \"It cannot be your father or Christy, for both of them have latch-ke"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18264"],["title","Within The Enemy's Lines (#6)"],["body","ys. Who could come here at this time in the evening?\"  \"Mr. Paul Vapoor,\" said the man-servant, who answered the bell.  The gentleman announced walked into the sitting-room without any ceremony, for he had long been a familiar visitor. He was dressed in the full uniform of a chief engineer of the navy. Removing his cap, he politely bowed to the two ladies; and any one who was looking might have seen that Miss Florry blushed a little when she saw him; and very likely if Major Pierson had witnessed the roses on her fair cheek, he might possibly have concluded that it would have been useless to postpone the capture of the Bellevite to enable him to fortify his position near her.  \"I beg your pardon, ladies, for calling so late,\" said Mr. Vapoor, as he drew a long envelope from his pocket. \"But I thought Christy might wish to see what is in this envelope before he retired.\"  \"Why, what is in it?\" asked Mrs. Passford.  \"Christy's commission as a midshipman in the navy.\"  \"But Christy is not at home, and we are somewhat anxious about him,\" added the mother, stating the facts in regard to her son.  Paul Vapoor volunteered to go in search of him, and left the house.     CHAPTER VI  THE CABIN OF THE FLORENCE   If Captain Carboneer had felt any especial interest in the Florence as a sailing yacht, he might have desired to see the cabin of the craft, which had always been the delight of Christy Passford. He had expended a great deal of his pocket-money upon the arrangement and furnishing of the cabin of his yacht, not only because he spent a considerable portion of his vacation hours in it, but because it had been a perpetual study with him to enlarge and improve it.  It is very difficult to get three pints of liquid into a quart measure, and it was a conundrum of this sort that Christy was studying upon when he tried to make a parlor, bedroom, and dining-saloon of the very limited space in the forward part of the Florence. Though he could hardly get the three pints into the quart measure, he had done the best he could, and succeeded to a rather remarkable degree. But spite of the miracle which had been wrought in the cabin, Captain Carboneer did not even try the door of the apartment when he and his companions went on board of the yacht. He was so absorbed in the enterprise in which he was engaged, that his indifference to the miracle of the cabin may be excused.  Even the double doors of the cabin were of handsome wood, elaborately polished; and they were not secured with the usual appliance of a padlock, but were provided with an expensive mortise-lock, which could be operated upon either side. If Captain Carboneer had tried to open that door, he would have found that it was fastened; but perhaps he could not have discovered that it had been secured upon the inside. Unless, therefore, he had taken the trouble to break open the door, he could not have ascertained that Christy Passford was actually in the cabin.  Possibly, if he had opened the door by any means, he would not have discovered that the proprietor of the boat was in this dainty apartment, for the skipper had taken a great deal of pains to conceal himself so that he should not be seen, even if the intruders in the Florence had succeeded in opening the doors without the aid of the key in his pocket. Though he had two very nice berths in the cabin, miraculously arranged as to space, Christy did not occupy one on the present occasion, for in that case the unbidden visitors would have seen him if their curiosity had led them to force the doors.  When the cook of the Florence, usually the skipper of the craft, was engaged in the practice of the culinary art, he seated himself on what looked like a box in front of the stove. But the interior of this box was really a part of the cabin, for it contained the feet of any one occupying the berth on the starboard side. The cookroom had no end of bins, lockers and drawers to contain the variety of provisions and stores necessary to get up a dinner for the skipper and his guests, when he had any. And even all these places could not contain everything that was needed on board. Under the two berths were large, though not very deep, lockers, one of which contained the jib-topsail of the craft, and other spare sails, while the opposite one was the fuel locker of the sloop.  As the boat had not been used for a long time in cruising, the fuel receptacle was empty, though a spare gaff-topsail had been thrown into it. This locker was big enough to admit the body-corporate of the skipper. It was not a particularly clean place, for a portion of it had been economized for the stowage of the charcoal, which the skipper preferred to wood. But he did not rebel at the blackness of the retreat he had chosen, for he wore his boating dress, which was hardly stylish enough for a dude or a dandy.  But Skipper Passford did not crawl into this black hole for the fun of the thing. He had been spending his time in waiting for a movement to be made in regard to the Bellevite. He staid in the house all the forenoon, and, after lunch, he sailed down the river in the Florence, though with no object in doing so beyond passing the time. Not far from the beach where he had afterwards left the yacht, he discovered a boat rowed by two men with a third in the stern sheets.  The breeze was quite gentle, though the Florence would sail at a very tolerable speed when there was the least apology for a wind. She was doing so on the present occasion, and Christy had stretched himself out on the cushioned seat, with the spokes of the wheel where he could steer without any exertion, or next to none. The idleness of his days since his return from the eventful cruise of the Bellevite seemed to have infected him with an unnatural indolence.  He felt as though he was rather more than half asleep when he saw the boat with the two oarsmen. It was going up the river, while he was going down. He had to luff a little to keep clear of the oars, but he did not move from his half-recumbent posture. When the boat was alongside, he glanced idly and carelessly at the person in the stern sheets. Instantly he was wide awake, though he did not change his position. The person looked like a gentleman, and Christy was sure that he had seen him before. A couple of minutes of earnest cudgelling of his brain assured him that he had seen the stranger in Nassau; that he was one of the many who wanted to purchase the Bellevite, ostensibly for a merchant vessel, but really for the Confederate navy.  After he had run a short distance farther down the river, Christy came about, the boat being some distance from him, but the gentleman soon landed and walked up the river on the shore, or very near it. In a short time, he was joined by another person, whose form looked familiar to the skipper of the Florence. He could not identify him, for he was not near enough to him to see his face. A puff of air came from across the river, and the Florence darted ahead, and Christy was soon out of sight of the two strangers.  Near the boundary of his father's estate, he ran the yacht on the sandy beach, letting her strike the sand hard enough to stick where she was for half an hour, though she was not likely to get adrift, for the gentle breeze was blowing her farther on the shore as the tide rose.  Christy hauled down the jib of the sloop, and then seated himself, or rather reclined upon the cushions, though in such a position that he could see the shore, or any persons who came upon it. No one was in sight, and he had no one to watch. The swash of a great steamer passing in the channel made his boat roll heavily for a moment, with the forward part of the bottom resting on the sand. For the want of something better to think of, he began to put conundrums to himself in the absence of any other person to perplex with them. What was the gentleman that wanted to buy a steamer in Nassau doing up the Hudson? This was the principal one: he could not answer it. He gave it up; as the French have it, he had to \"throw his tongue to the dogs,\" having no use for it in this connection.  But while he was dreaming of the possible mission of the stranger, he heard voices on the beach. Not deeming it wise to show himself, he rolled off the cushion upon the floor of the standing-room, and then fixed himself in a position where he could see and hear what passed between the speakers. He could see without being seen. It did not require a second look for him to decide that the second person on the beach was Major Pierson, though his companion called him Mulgate.  If Christy had been interested before, he was excited now. The two speakers were within earshot of the boat, and in the stillness of the scene he could hear every word that was said. In a few moments he was in full possession of the statements of the captain and the major in regard to their intentions; and it appeared that the gentleman he had seen in Nassau still desired to obtain a steamer.  Before it was dark, Christy was astonished to behold his cousin Corny on the other side of the fence; and he readily understood that he was to take part in the enterprise in hand. As yet the listener had obtained but little more than the information in regard to the intention of the visitors. When he found that they were disposed to take possession of the Florence, and make their visit to the Bellevite in her, the skipper retired from the standing-room of the boat to the cabin, where he locked the door, and put the key in his pocket. When he realized that they really meant to come on board, he crawled into the space under the starboard berth, and arranged the sail so that it would conceal him in case the intruders pushed their investigation into the cabin.  When he had completed his preparations, he was quite satisfied that he should not be discovered. The trio came on board, and Christy fixed himself so that he could hear every word that was said, for there was a small opening"]]]
