Before the sound-waves had reached them, he had been legging it into the house. The television had been on, and it had been acting as insanely as the screen on his right now. He had called the State Police--the telephones had been working all right--and told them who he was, and they had told him to stay put and they'd send a car for him. They did, within minutes. Janet and his host and hostess had waited with him on the lawn until it came, and after he had gotten into it, he had turned around and looked back through the rear window, and seen Janet standing under the front light, holding the little dog in her arms, flopping one of its silly little paws up and down with her hand to wave goodbye to him.  He had seen her and the dog like that every day of his life for the last fifteen years.  \"What kind of radiation are you getting?\" he could hear Alexis Pitov asking into a phone. \"What? Nothing else? Oh; yes, of course. But mostly cosmic. That shouldn't last long.\" He turned from the phone. \"A devil's own dose of cosmic, and some gamma. It was the cosmic radiation that put the radios and telescreens out. That's why I insisted that the drone planes be independent of radio control.\"  They always got cosmic radiation from the micro-annihilations in the test-vault. Well, now they had an idea of what produced natural cosmic rays. There must be quite a bit of negamatter and posimatter going into mutual annihilation and total energy release through the Universe.  \"Of course, there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn,\" he said. \"We didn't really begin to find anything out for half an hour. By that time, the cosmic radiation was over and we weren't getting anything but gamma.\"  \"What--What has Auburn to do--?\" The Russian stopped short. \"You think this was the same thing?\" He gave it a moment's consideration. \"Lee, you're crazy! There wasn't an atom of artificial negamatter in the world in 1969. Nobody had made any before us. We gave each other some scientific surprises, then, but nobody surprised both of us. You and I, between us, knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in the world. And you know as well as I do--\"  A voice came out of the public-address speaker. \"Some of the radio equipment around the target area, that wasn't knocked out by blast, is beginning to function again. There is an increasingly heavy gamma radiation, but no more cosmic rays. They were all prompt radiation from the annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect. Wait a moment; Captain Urquiola, of the Air Force, says that the first drone plane is about to take off.\"  It had been two hours after the blast that the first drones had gone over what had been Auburn, New York. He was trying to remember, as exactly as possible, what had been learned from them. Gamma radiation; a great deal of gamma. But it didn't last long. It had been almost down to a safe level by the time the investigation had been called off, and, two months after there had been no more missiles, and no way of producing more, and no targets to send them against if they'd had them, rather--he had been back at Auburn on his hopeless quest, and there had been almost no trace of radiation. Nothing but a wide, shallow crater, almost two hundred feet in diameter and only fifteen at its deepest, already full of water, and a circle of flattened and scattered rubble for a mile and a half all around it. He was willing to bet anything that that was what they'd find where the chunk of nega-iron had landed, fifty miles away on the pampas.  Well, the first drone ought to be over the target area before long, and at least one of the balloons that had been sent up was reporting its course by radio. The radios in the others were silent, and the recording counters had probably jammed in all of them. There'd be something of interest when the first drone came back. He dragged his mind back to the present, and went to work with Alexis Pitov.  They were at it all night, checking, evaluating, making sure that the masses of data that were coming in were being promptly processed for programming the computers. At each of the increasingly frequent coffee-breaks, he noticed Pitov looking curiously. He said nothing, however, until, long after dawn, they stood outside the bunker, waiting for the jeep that would take them back to their bungalow and watching the line of trucks--Argentine army engineers, locally hired laborers, load after load of prefab-huts and equipment--going down toward the target-area, where they would be working for the next week.  \"Lee, were you serious?\" Pitov asked. \"I mean, about this being like the one at Auburn?\"  \"It was exactly like Auburn; even that blazing light that came rushing down out of the sky. I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that. Now I know. We just launched one like it.\"  \"But that's impossible! I told you, between us we know everything that was happening in nuclear physics then. Nobody in the world knew how to assemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses.\"  \"Nobody, and nothing, on this planet built that mass of negamatter. I doubt if it even came from this Galaxy. But we didn't know that, then. When that negamatter meteor fell, the only thing anybody could think of was that it had been a Soviet missile. If it had hit around Leningrad or Moscow or Kharkov, who would you have blamed it on?\"   THE END.            *       *       *       *       *  TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED  The following typographical errors in the text were corrected as detailed here.

AND NEW YORK    Printed in U.S.A.     THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN   I.        Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,     By famous Hanover city;       The river Weser, deep and wide,       Washes its wall on the southern side;       A pleasanter spot you never spied;     But, when begins my ditty,       Almost five hundred years ago,       To see the townsfolk suffer so         From vermin, was a pity.   II.        Rats!     They fought the dogs and killed the cats,       And bit the babies in the cradles,       And ate the cheeses out of the vats.       And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,     Split open the kegs of salted sprats,     Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,     And even spoiled the women's chats,       By drowning their speaking       With shrieking and squeaking     In fifty different sharps and flats.   III.      At last the people in a body         To the Town Hall came flocking:     \"Tis clear,\" cried they, \"our Mayor's a noddy;         And as for our Corporation--shocking     To think we buy gowns lined with ermine     For dolts that can't or won't determine     What's best to rid us of our vermin!     You hope, because you're old and obese,     To find in the furry civic robe ease?     Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking     To find the remedy we're lacking,     Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!\"     At this the Mayor and Corporation     Quaked with a mighty consternation.   IV.      An hour they sate in council,       At length the Mayor broke silence:     \"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;       I wish I were a mile hence!     It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--     I'm sure my poor head aches again,     I've scratched it so, and all in vain     Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!\"     Just as he said this, what should hap     At the chamber door but a gentle tap?     \"Bless us,\" cried the Mayor, \"what's that?\"     (With the Corporation as he sat,     Looking little though wondrous fat;     Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister     Than a too-long-opened oyster,     Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous     For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)     \"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?     Anything like the sound of a rat     Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!\"   V.      \"Come in!\"--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:     And in did come the strangest figure!     His queer long coat from heel to head     Was half of yellow and half of red,     And he himself was tall and thin,     With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,     And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin     No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,     But lips where smile went out and in;     There was no guessing his kith and kin:     And nobody could enough admire     The tall man and his quaint attire.     Quoth one: \"It's as my great-grandsire,     Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,     Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!\"   VI.      He advanced to the council-table:     And, \"Please your honours,\" said he, \"I'm able,     By means of a secret charm, to draw     All creatures living beneath the sun,     That creep or swim or fly or run,     After me so as you never saw!     And I chiefly use my charm     On creatures that do people harm,     The mole and toad and newt and viper;     And people call me the Pied Piper.\"     (And here they noticed round his neck     A scarf of red and yellow stripe,     To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;     And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;     And his fingers they noticed were ever straying     As if impatient to be playing     Upon his pipe, as low it dangled     Over his vesture so old-fangled.)     \"Yet,\" said he, \"poor Piper as I am,     In Tartary I freed the Cham,     Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats,     I eased in Asia the Nizam     Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats:     And as for what your brain bewilders,     If I can rid your town of rats     Will you give me a thousand guilders?\"     \"One? fifty thousand!\"--was the exclamation     Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.   VII.      Into the street the Piper stept,       Smiling first a little smile,     As if he knew what magic slept       In his quiet pipe the while;     Then, like a musical adept,     To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,     And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,     Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;     And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,     You heard as if an army muttered;     And the muttering grew to a grumbling;     And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;     And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.     Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,     Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,     Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,       Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,     Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,       Families by tens and dozens,     Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--     Followed the Piper for their lives.     From street to street he piped advancing,     And step for step they followed dancing,     Until they came to the river Weser     Wherein all plunged and perished!     --Save one who, stout as Julius Cæsar,     Swam across and lived to carry     (As he, the manuscript he cherished)     To Rat-land home his commentary:     Which was, \"At the first shrill notes of the pipe,     I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,     And putting apples, wondrous ripe,     Into a cider-press's gripe:     And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,     And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,     And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,     And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:     And it seemed as if a voice     (Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery     Is breathed) called out, 'Oh rats, rejoice!     The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!     So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,     Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'     And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,     All ready staved, like a great sun shone     Glorious scarce an inch before me,     Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'     --I found the Weser rolling o'er me.\"   VIII.      You should have heard the Hamelin people     Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple     \"Go,\" cried the Mayor, \"and get long poles,     Poke out the nests and block up the holes!     Consult with carpenters and builders,     And leave in our town not even a trace     Of the rats!\"--when suddenly up the face     Of the Piper perked in the market-place,     With a, \"First, if you please, my thousand guilders!\"   IX.      A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;     So did the Corporation too.     For council dinners made rare havoc     With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;     And half the money would replenish     Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.     To pay this sum to a wandering fellow     With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!     \"Beside,\" quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink,     \"Our business was done at the river's brink;     We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,     And what's dead can't come to life, I think.     So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink     From the duty of giving you something to drink,     And a matter of money to put in your poke;     But as for the guilders, what we spoke     Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.     Beside, our losses have made us thrifty.     A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!\"   X.      The Piper's face fell, and he cried,     \"No trifling! I can't wait, beside!     I've promised to visit by dinner-time     Bagdad, and accept the prime     Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,     For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,     Of a nest of scorpions no survivor:     With him I proved no bargain-driver,     With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!     And folks who put me in a passion     May find me pipe after another fashion.\"   XI.      \"How?\" cried the Mayor, \"d' ye think I brook     Being worse treated than a Cook?     Insulted by a lazy ribald     With idle pipe and vesture piebald?     You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,     Blow your pipe there till you burst!\"   XII.      Once more he stept into the street,       And to his lips again     Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;       And ere he blew three notes                                      (such sweet     Soft notes as yet musician's cunning       Never gave the enraptured air)     There was a rustling,     that seemed like a bustling     Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,     Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,     Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,     And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,     Out came the children running.     All the little boys and girls,     With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,     And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls.     Tripping     and skipping,     ran merrily after     The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.   XIII.      The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood     As if they were changed into blocks of wood,     Unable to move a step, or cry     To the children merrily skipping by.     --Could only follow with the eye     That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.     But how the Mayor was on the rack,     And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,     As the Piper turned from the High Street     To where the Weser rolled its waters     Right in the way of their sons and daughters!     However he turned from South to West,     And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,     And after him the children pressed;     Great was the joy in every breast.     \"He never can cross that mighty top!     He's forced to let the piping drop,     And we shall see our children stop!\"     When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,     A wondrous portal opened wide,     As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;     And the Piper advanced "]]]
