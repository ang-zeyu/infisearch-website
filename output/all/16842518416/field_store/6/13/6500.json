She wrote away, getting hotter and hotter as she realized her deficiencies, winding up five minutes before the time allotted, in a flushed and decidedly inky condition.  At eleven a short interval was allowed, and the candidates thankfully adjourned. Outside in the corridor they compared notes.  \"Well, of all detestable papers this geography one is the limit!\" declared an aggrieved voice.  It was the girl who had said that she always mixed Madras and Bombay, and who had studied her text-book up to the last available moment. Apparently her eleventh hour industry had not sufficed to tide her over her difficulties.  \"It was catchy in parts,\" agreed the owner of the swastika, \"but I liked one or two questions. I just happened to know them, so I bowled ahead. That's what comes of wearing a mascot!\"  \"Don't crow too soon!\" laughed the girl with the fair pigtail. \"Remember, there are four other exams. to follow. Your luck may leave you at any moment.\"  \"Don't mention more exams.! I feel inclined to turn tail and run home!\" declared another.  \"There's the bell! Don't give us much time, do they? Now for the torture chamber again! Brace your nerves!\"  \"I wonder if most of them have done better or worse than I have!\" thought Winona, as she took her seat once more at No. 10 desk. \"A good many were grumbling, but that sandy-haired girl in the spectacles said nothing. No more did the one with the red hair-ribbon. Of course they might be feeling too agonized for words, but on the other hand they might be secretly congratulating themselves.\"  It was not the moment, however, for speculation as to her neighbors' progress. The next set of questions was being distributed, and she took up her copy eagerly. Her heart fell as she read it over. Her knowledge of English history was not very accurate, and the facts demanded were for the most part exactly those which she could not remember. The dread of failure loomed up large. She could only attempt about half of the questions, and even in these she was not ready with dates. Then suddenly Percy's advice flashed into her mind. \"Write from a romantic standpoint, and make your paper sound poetical.\" It seemed rather a forlorn hope, and she feared it would scarcely satisfy her examiners, but in such a desperate situation anything was worth trying. Winona possessed a certain facility in essay writing. Prose composition had been her favorite lesson at Miss Harmon's. She collected her wits now, and did the very utmost of which she was capable in the matter of style. Choosing question No. 4, \"Write a life of Lady Jane Grey,\" she proceeded to treat the subject in as post-impressionist a manner as possible. The pathetic tragedy of the young Queen had always appealed to her imagination, and she could have had no more congenial a theme upon which to write, if she had been given free choice of all the characters in the history book.  \"'Whom the gods love die young,'\" she began, and paused. It seemed an excellent opening, if she could only continue in the same strain, but what ought to come next? Her thoughts flew to a painting of Lady Jane Grey, which she had once seen at a loan collection of Tudor portraits. Why should she not describe it? Her pen flew rapidly as she wrote a word-picture of the sweet, pale face, so round and childish in spite of its earnest expression; the smooth yellow hair, the gray eyes bent demurely over the book. Her heroine seemed beginning to live. Now for her surroundings. A year ago Winona had paid a visit to Hampton Court, and her remembrance of its associations was still keen and vivid. She described its old-world garden by the side of the Thames, where the little King Edward VI. must often have roamed with his pretty cousin Jane: the two wonderful ill-starred children, playing for a brief hour in happy unconsciousness of the fate that faced them. What did they talk about, she asked, as they stood on the paved terrace and watched the river hurrying by? Plato, perchance, and his philosophy, or the marvelous geography-book with woodcuts of foreign beasts that had been specially printed for the young king's use. Did they compare notes about their tutors? Jane would certainly hold a brief for her much-loved Mr. Elmer, who, in sharp contrast to her parents' severity, taught her so gently and patiently that she grudged the time which was not spent in his presence. Edward might bemoan the ill-luck of his whipping-boy, who had to bear the floggings which Court etiquette denied to the royal shoulders, and perhaps would declare that when he was grown up, and could make the laws himself, no children should be beaten for badly said lessons, and Jane would agree with him, and then they would pick the red damask roses that Cardinal Wolsey had planted, and walk back under the shadow of the clipped yew hedge to eat cherries and junket in the room that looked out towards the sunset.  Winona had warmed to her work. Her imagination, always her strongest faculty, completely carried her away. She pictured her heroine's life, not from the outside, as historians would chronicle it, a mere string of events and dates, but from the inner view of a girl's standpoint. Did Jane wish to leave her Plato for the bustle of a Court? Did she care for the gay young husband forced upon her by her ambitious parents? Surely for her gentle nature a crown held few allurements. The clouds were gathering thick and fast, and burst in a waterspout of utter ruin. Jane's courage was calm and hopeful as that of Socrates in the dialogues she had loved.          \"... your soul was pure and true,     The good stars met in your horoscope,     Made you of spirit, fire and dew.\"  quoted Winona enthusiastically. Browning always stirred her blood, and threw her into poetical channels. She cast about in her mind for any other appropriate verses.      \"Ah, broken is the golden bowl, the spirit gone for ever,     Let the bell toll--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.     Come, let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung,     An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young,     A dirge for her, the doubly dead, in that she died so young.\"  \"So they finished their foul deed, and laid her to rest,\" wrote Winona, \"the earthly part, that is, which perishes, for the true part of her they could not touch. Farewell, sweet innocent soul, of whom the world was not worthy. To you surely may apply Andre de Chénier's tender lines:      \"'Au banquet de la vie à peine commencé     Un instant seulement mes lèvres out pressé     La coupe en mes mains encore pleine.'  Vale, little Queen! May it be well with thee! Ave atque vale!\"  Winona glanced anxiously at the clock as with a hard breath she paused for a moment and laid down her pen. Her theme had taken her so long that she had only ten minutes left for the other questions. There was no romantic side to be expressed in these, so she scribbled away half-heartedly. Her uncertain memory, which had readily supplied quotations from Browning or Edgar Allan Poe, struck altogether when asked for such sordid details as the names of the Cabal ministry, or the history of the Long Parliament. The bell rang, and left her with her paper only half finished. At one o'clock the candidates were given an hour's rest, and a hot lunch was served to them in the dining-hall. At two they returned to their desks, and the examination continued until half-past four. Winona found the questions tolerable. She did fairly, but not at all brilliantly. Her brains were not accustomed to such long-sustained efforts, and as the afternoon wore on, a neuralgic headache began, and sent sharp throbs of pain across her forehead. It was so irksome to write pages of Latin or French verbs; she had to summon all her courage to make herself do it. The last hour seemed an interminable penance.  At half-past four, twenty-one rather dispirited candidates filed from the room.  \"Well, thank goodness it's over! I never want to write another word in my life. My hand's stiff with cramp!\" exclaimed the girl with the red hair-ribbon to a sympathetic audience in the passage.  \"It was awful! I didn't answer half the questions. My swastika isn't worth its salt. I shall give it away!\" mourned the owner of the mascot.  \"They expected us to know so very much; we should be absolute encyclopaedias if we had all that pat off at our fingers' ends!\" sighed the girl with the fair pigtail.  \"How did you get on?\" Winona asked the ruddy-haired girl, who was wiping her spectacles nervously.  \"Oh, I don't know. It's so hard to tell. I answered most of the questions, but of course I can't say whether they're right or wrong. Wasn't the Latin translation just too horrible? I yearned for a dictionary. And some of the French grammar questions were absolute catches!\"  \"We went on too long,\" said Winona. \"It would have been much better to spread the exam, over two days.\"  \"Do you think so? I'd rather have 'sudden death' myself. It's such a relief to feel it's finished. It would be wretched to have to begin again to-morrow. I hardly slept a wink last night for thinking about it. I'm going to try and forget it now.\"  Winona nodded good-by to her fellow candidates, and took her leave. How many of them would she see again, she wondered, and which among all the number would have the luck?  \"Certainly not myself,\" she thought ruefully. \"I know my papers weren't up to standard. I believe that red-haired girl will be one. She looked clever!\"  Winona had spent the preceding night with Aunt Harriet, who offered to keep her until the result of the examination should be published, but the prospect of spending a week of suspense at Abbey Close was so formidable, that she had begged to be allowed to return home, excusing herself on the plea that she would like to be with Percy during the remainder of his holidays. It was a very subdued Winona who reached Highfield next afternoon.  \"Hello, Tiddleywinks! You've lost the starch out of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],["title","The Luckiest Girl in the School (#4)"],["body","ou!\" Percy greeted her. \"Did they say they wouldn't have you at any price?\"  \"The result won't be out till the fifteenth, but I expect I've failed,\" answered Winona gloomily.  \"Buck up, young 'un! Look at yours truly! I fail nine times out of ten, and do I take it to heart?\"  Winona laughed in spite of herself. Percy's complacency over small achievements was proverbial. But she had higher ambitions, and the cloud of depression soon settled down again. Her temper, not always her strong point, displayed a degree of irritability that drove her family to the verge of mutiny.  \"Really, Winona, I don't remember you so fractious since you were cutting your teeth!\" complained her much-tried mother.  The days dragged slowly by. Winona had never before realized that each hour could hold so many minutes. On the morning of the 15th she came down to breakfast with dark rings round her eyes.  \"I shall be glad to be put out of my misery!\" she thought, as the postman's rap-tap sounded at the door.  Mamie made a rush for the letter-box, and returned bearing a foolscap envelope addressed to:                                     MISS WINONA WOODWARD,                                              Highfield,                                                   Ashbourne,                                                     nr. Great Marston.  Winona opened it with trembling fingers. But as she read, her face flushed and her eyes sparkled.  \"I have much pleasure in informing you\" (so ran the letter) \"that the Governors of the Seaton High School have decided to award you a Scholarship tenable for two years....\"  In silence she passed the paper to her mother.  \"Congratulations, dear child!\" cried Mrs. Woodward, clapping her hands. \"It's the unexpected that happens!\"  \"Oh, my goodness!\" ejaculated Percy. \"You never mean to tell me that Tiddleywinks has actually been and gone and won!\"     CHAPTER III  Seaton High School   The autumn term at Seaton High School began on September 22nd. On the 21st Winona set forth with great flourish of trumpets, feeling more or less of a heroine. To have been selected for a scholarship among twenty-one candidates was a distinction that even Aunt Harriet would admit. In the brief interval pending her departure, her home circle had treated her with a respect they had never before accorded her.  \"I hope you'll do well, child,\" said her mother, half proud and half tearful when it came to the parting. \"We shall miss you here, but when you get on yourself you must help the younger ones. I shall look to you to push them on in life.\"  There is a certain satisfaction in the knowledge that you are considered the prop of the family. Winona's eyes glowed. In imagination she was already Principal of a large school, and providing posts as assistant mistresses for Letty, Mamie and Doris, that is to say unless she turned her attention to medicine, but in that case she could be head of a Women's Hospital, and have them as house surgeons or dispensers, or something else equally distinguished and profitable. It might even be possible to provide occupation for Godfrey or Ernie, though this was likely to prove a tougher job than placing the girls. With such a brilliant beginning, the future seemed an easy walk-over.  Mrs. Woodward was exulting over the fact that she had engaged Miss Jones when she did, and that Winona's school clothes were all made and finished. There had been a fluster at the last, when it was discovered that her mackintosh was fully six inches too short for her new skirts, and that she had outgrown her thick boots, but a hurried visit to Great Marston had remedied these deficiencies, and the box was packed to everybody's satisfaction. There was a universal feeling in the family that such an outfit could not fail to meet with Aunt Harriet's approval. The first sight of the nightdress case and the brush-and-comb bag must wring admiration from her. They had been bought at a bazaar, and were altogether superior to those in daily use. As for the handkerchief case, Letty had decided that unless one equally well embroidered were presented to her on her next birthday, she would be obliged to assert her individuality by showing temper.  Winona walked into the dressing-room of the High School on September 22nd with a mixture of shyness and importance. On the whole the latter predominated. It was a trifle embarrassing to face so many strangers, but it was something to have won a scholarship. She wondered who was the other fortunate candidate.  \"I expect it will be that red-haired girl with the spectacles,\" she thought. \"I believe she answered every question, though she was rather quiet about it.\"  She looked round, but could not see the ruddy locks, nor indeed any of the companions who had taken the examination with her.  \"Hunting for some one you know?\" asked a girl who had appropriated the next hook to hers.  \"Yes, at least I'm not sure whether she'll be here or not. I believe her name's Marjorie Kaye.\"  \"Never heard of her!\"  \"There are heaps of new girls,\" volunteered another who stood by.  \"I wondered if she'd won a County Scholarship,\" added Winona.  \"Ask me a harder! I tell you I've never heard her name before.\"  \"I've won the other scholarship.\"  Winona's voice was intended to sound very casual.  \"Indeed!\"  Her neighbor was taking off her boots, and did not seem as much impressed as the occasion merited.  \"Oh! so you're one of the 'outlanders,'\" sniggered another. \"It's a sort of 'go into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in' business.\"  \"I suppose we shall be having Council School Scholarships next!\" drawled a third.  They were friends, and went off together without another glance at Winona. She followed soberly, wondering what she ought to do next. She had a vague idea that the winner of a scholarship should present herself at the Head Mistress' study to receive a few words of encouragement and congratulation on her success. At the top of the stairs she met the mistress who had presided over the examination. The latter greeted her unceremoniously.  \"Winona Woodward, you've been placed in V.a., first room to the right, round the corner. You'll find the number on the door.\"  Other girls were hurrying in the same direction. Winona entered with what seemed to her quite a small crowd. Everybody appeared to know where to go, except herself. She stood in such evident hesitation that one, more good-natured than the rest, remarked:  \"You'd better seize on any desk you fancy, as quick as you can. They're getting taken up fast, if you want a front one!\"  Winona slid into the nearest seat at hand, and appropriated it by placing her note-book, pencil-box, ruler, atlas and dictionaries inside the desk.  The room was filling quickly. Every moment fresh arrivals hurried in and took their places. Marjorie Kaye was nowhere to be seen, but in the second row sat the dark-eyed girl with the red ribbon in her hair. She turned round and nodded pleasantly.  \"So she's got the other scholarship!\" thought Winona. \"I shouldn't have expected it. I'd have staked my reputation on the sandy-haired one. Well, I suppose her answers weren't correct, after all. I'm rather glad on the whole it's this girl; she looks jolly.\"  At that moment Miss Huntley, the form mistress, entered and took the call-over, and the day's work began. Each girl was given a time-table and a list of the books she would require, and after that, class succeeded class until one o'clock, with a ten minutes' interval for lunch at eleven. The conclusion of the morning left Winona with a profound respect for High School methods. After the easy-going routine of Miss Harmon's it was like stepping into a new educational world. She supposed she would be able to keep pace with it when she got her books, but the mathematics, at any rate, were much more advanced than what she had before attempted. As she walked down the corridor, the girl with the red hair-ribbon overtook her, and claimed acquaintance.  \"So you're Winona Woodward? And I'm Garnet Emerson. We had the luck, after all! I'm sure I never expected to win. It was the greatest surprise to me when the letter arrived. Yes, five of the other candidates are at school, but they've been put in IV.a., and IV.b. Marjorie Kaye? You mean that girl in spectacles? No, she's not come. I heard her say that if she didn't win she was to be sent somewhere else. Where are you staying? With an aunt? I'm with a second cousin. She's nice, but I wish they'd open a hostel; it would be topping to be with a heap of others, wouldn't it? We'd get up acting in the evenings, and all sorts of fun. Well, perhaps that may come later on. I shall see you this afternoon, shan't I?\"  \"Yes, I'm coming for my books. It's too late to stop and get them now.\"  Afternoon attendance at the High School was not nominally compulsory. All the principal subjects were taken in the morning, but there were classes for drawing, singing or physical culture from half-past two until four, and practically very few girls had more than one free afternoon in a week. Any who liked might do preparation in their own form room, and many availed themselves of the permission, especially those who came from a distance, and stayed for dinner at the school. When Winona first examined her time-table she had not considered its demands excessively formidable, but before she had been a week at Seaton she began to realize that she would have very few spare moments to call her own. Miss Bishop believed in girls being fully occupied, and in addition to the ordinary form work, expected every one to take part in the games, and in the numerous societies and guilds which had been instituted. Winona found that she was required to join the Debating Club, and the Patriotic Knitting Guild, while a Dramatic Society and a Literary Association would be prepared to open their doors to her if she proved worthy of admission. So far, however, she considered that she had enough on her hands. The"]]]
