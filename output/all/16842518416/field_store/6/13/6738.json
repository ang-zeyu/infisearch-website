[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18264"],["title","Within The Enemy's Lines (#1)"],["body","their early boyhood, a remarkably strong fraternal affection had subsisted. Both of them were high-toned men, and both of them had always been faithful in the discharge of every duty to God and man. Each of them had a wife, a son and a daughter, and two happier families could not have been found on the face of the earth. They were not only devoted to each other, each within its own circle, but the two families were as nearly one as it was possible to be.  Captain Horatio had formerly been a shipmaster, and had accumulated an immense fortune. Homer was less fortunate in this respect, and his tastes were somewhat different from those of his brother. He wanted to be a planter, and with the financial assistance of his brother, he went into the business of raising cotton near Mobile, in Alabama. But years before the war, he had paid off every dollar of his indebtedness to Horatio, and had made a comfortable fortune besides. The two families had visited each other as much an possible, and the captain, with his little family, had been almost to the plantation in the Bellevite, the magnificent steam-yacht of the Northerner.  During the preceding winter, Captain Passford, his wife and son, had visited most of the islands of the Atlantic; but the health of Miss Florry was considerably impaired, and the doctors would not permit her to make this sea-voyage, but recommended her to keep quiet in some southern locality. She had therefore passed the winter at Glenfield, which was the name of Homer Passford's plantation. On his return from this long cruise, the owner of the Bellevite obtained his first news that war existed between the North and the South from the pilot. The three members of the family on board of the steamer were greatly distressed over the fact that Florry was still at the home of her uncle in Alabama, within the enemy's lines.  Without going on shore, Captain Passford decided to arm his yacht, which was large enough for a man-of-war, and hasten to Mobile Bay to bring back his daughter. He was in doubt with regard to the political feeling of Homer, but believed that he would still adhere to the government and the Union. It was a part of his mission to bring his brother and his family to his own home at Bonnydale. Mrs. Passford was sent on shore in a tug, and Christy, the son, was to go with her; but the young man, just entering his seventeenth year, protested against being left at home, and as the captain believed that a patriotic citizen ought to be willing to give his all, even his sons, to his country, the young man went with his father. The mother was as devoted to her country as the father, and terrible as was the ordeal, she consented to part with him for such a duty.  By an event fortunate for him, Captain Passford succeeded in obtaining an armament for his vessel, as well as an abundant supply of ammunition; and the vessel was refitted for the perilous service in which she was to be engaged. At Nassau, Christy made the acquaintance of a young man who proved to be of great service to the expedition, and the Bellevite reached her destination in safety, though not without some rather exciting incidents.  Captain Passford found that his brother was sincerely and devotedly attached to the Southern cause. They discussed the great question for hours upon hours, each striving to convert the other to his own views, but with no success on the part of either. Homer Passford was a religious man, conscientious in the discharge of every duty, and nothing less could be said of his Northern brother. In a short time the owner of the Bellevite found that he had fallen into a \"hornet's nest,\" for the planter did not believe that he ought to allow the steam-yacht to be taken to New York to become a part of the navy of the Union. He declared his convictions to his brother, who was compelled to regard the planter as an enemy in spite of the relations subsisting between them. Both of them placed their duty to their own country above every other consideration.  Captain Passford was obliged to get his daughter out of his brother's house by stealth, and to make his escape with the Bellevite as best he could.  Major Lindley Pierson, in command of Fort Gaines, at the entrance to Mobile Bay, had permitted the steamer to pass, having been deceived by his younger brother. He had been a frequent visitor at the mansion of Homer Passford, attracted there, it appeared, by the lovely daughter of the planter's brother, remaining there for the winter. Perhaps on her account, perhaps with the fear that the Bellevite was not what she had appeared to be, he had gone to the vicinity of Glenfield to inquire into the mission of the steamer.  Homer Passford, acting upon his convictions, gave information which resulted in an attempt to capture the Bellevite. Christy, not informed in regard to the plans of his father to depart at once in the steamer, was \"Taken by the Enemy,\" and had some very stirring adventures in the bay. But the steamer escaped from the numerous enemies that awaited her, and Christy got on board of her at the last minute. The Bellevite ran the gantlet of the forts in a dense fog, and brought Miss Florry in safety to her home at Bonnydale.  Corny Passford, whose unexpected arrival at Bonnydale had excited the astonishment of his uncle, was a year older than Christy, and had enlisted in the Confederate service at the insistence of Major Pierson. Without knowing anything in particular about the matter, his uncle believed, at his visit to Glenfield, that Corny was as earnestly devoted to the Southern cause as his father, judging entirely from the fact that he had enlisted as a soldier.  Corny had a good appetite, and a good supper was set before him. He ate like a hungry boy, and the fact that he was within the enemy's lines did not seem to have any influence upon him. His aunt helped him till he seemed to be filled to repletion, for she thought he must have been accustomed of late only to the most indifferent fare. After supper, he followed his uncle back to the library; but he seemed less embarrassed than before.  \"Where is Christy, Uncle Horatio?\" asked Corny, as he seated himself in the library. \"I have not seen him yet; and as I was away at the fort when you went to Glenfield, I did not see him then.\"  \"I don't know where he is just now, though he is in or about the house most of the time,\" replied the captain. \"Are you still in the army, Corny?\"  \"No, sir, I am here. I did not like the service very well, and I thought I should like the navy better. The reason why I did not like it as well as at first was because I was no longer in Major Pierson's battalion,\" replied Corny, looking at his uncle as though he expected a question from him.  \"Then Major Pierson is no longer in the army?\" added the captain.  \"Oh, yes, he is; but I think he was the maddest man in the army soon after you left.\"  \"Indeed! Why was he so mad?\"  \"Because he was removed from command of Fort Gaines for letting you pass it in your steamer.\"  \"Then he is still in the service?\" asked Captain Passford.  \"Yes, sir; he is a good officer, and he will make his way, if he was guilty of a blunder in letting the Bellevite pass the fort.\"  \"Then you intend to be a sailor, Corny?\"  \"Yes, sir; in fact, I am a sailor now. I had been in your yacht so much that I knew something about the ropes, and I had no difficulty in getting transferred, as sailors were wanted more than soldiers,\" replied Corny, who seemed to be studying the figures in the carpet.  \"But if you went into the navy, how do you happen to be in New York?\" asked Captain Passford.  \"I suppose you remember the Dauphine, which was fitting out when you were in Mobile Bay?\" continued Corny.  \"I heard the name, and was told that she was one of the vessels that tried to prevent the escape of the Bellevite.\"  \"I was sent on board of her; but, in coming out of the bay, she was captured by a Federal vessel, and sent to New York. I hid myself when the crew were taken off, and came in her here,\" replied Corny, still studying the carpet.  Captain Passford had not heard of the capture of the Dauphine. He was not quite satisfied with the story of his nephew. But he was obliged to go to the city, and he handed the guest over to his wife and daughter. Corny wanted to see Christy, and Mrs. Passford had begun to be uneasy that he did not return at dark. Corny went out to find him.     CHAPTER II  A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION   The Bellevite lay in the river, off the estate of Captain Passford, though at a little distance below the mansion, from the windows of which she could not be seen. Corny walked down the avenue and over the hill, in the direction of the anchorage of the steamer. The boat-house was near the mansion, and to the float attached to it a variety of small craft were made fast. But the water was not deep enough there for the Bellevite. Corny had been to Bonnydale, and passed many weeks there, so that he was familiar with the localities.  As he passed the boat-house, he noticed that the Florence, which was Christy's favorite sailing craft, was not at her moorings, and he concluded that his cousin was away in her on some excursion. When he reached the boundary line of the estate, he discovered the sailboat with her bow on the beach, though her mainsail was still set. A gentle breeze was blowing, with which the Florence could make good headway; but there seemed to be no one on board of her. Corny watched her for some time, waiting for the appearance of Christy. It was not an easy matter to climb the high fence which bounded the estate, and the planter's son could hail the boat, and be taken on board of her as soon as she got under way again.  But Christy did not appear, and it was getting darker and darker every minute. Something must have attracted the attention of the skipper on shore, and he had doubtless landed. But while Corny was waiting for his cousin, he saw two men making their way through the grove on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18264"],["title","Within The Enemy's Lines (#2)"],["body","other side of the fence towards the river. One of them he recognized, and gave a peculiar whistle, which drew the two men in the direction from which it came.  \"Is that you, major?\" asked Corny, in a low tone.  \"Hush! You are a simpleton, Corny!\" exclaimed one of the men, as he came up to the palisades of the fence. \"Didn't I tell you not to call me by name?\"  \"I didn't call you by name,\" replied Corny, smartly.  \"You called me major, and that is about the same thing,\" added the speaker on the other side of the fence.  \"The woods are full of majors now, both in the North and the South, and no one knows you especially by that name. But I will remember in future, Mr. Mulgate,\" replied Corny.  \"That sounds better, Neal. If we lose the game it will be by your blundering,\" continued the major, or Mulgate, as he preferred to be called on the present occasion.  \"I suppose you have no talent for blundering, Mulgate; and that is the reason why you happen to be here at the present moment,\" retorted Corny, not at all pleased with the speech of the other.  \"None of your impudence, Neal!\" said Mulgate, sharply.  \"If you lose the game, you say that it will be by my blundering, Mulgate,\" continued Corny. \"That makes it seem as though I was to bear the responsibility of a failure; and I don't like the looks of things. If I am to be responsible for a failure, I ought to have something to say about the manner of conducting the enterprise.\"  \"Shut up, Neal! We have no time to talk nonsense of that sort. I am to conduct the enterprise, and you are to obey my orders. That is the whole of it,\" replied Mulgate, impatient at the position taken by the young man. \"You are still under my command, and you will obey me or take the consequences. Now to business: what have you learned?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" answered Corny, rather sullenly.  \"What have you been about? Haven't you discovered anything?\"  \"Nothing at all; I have but just arrived here. I took supper with my uncle, and told him the fish story you invented for me.\"  \"Did he believe it?\"  \"I don't know whether he did or not; but he and the rest of the family treated me very handsomely, which made me feel meaner than a dead catfish.\"  \"Never mind your feelings; you are here to assist in a great enterprise, and you are expected to do your duty to your country without regard to your own notions. Report what you have done.\"  \"I haven't done anything but introduce myself into the house, and explain how I happen to be here,\" replied Corny, as he proceeded to give the details of his meeting with his uncle.  \"Is Miss Florry at home?\" asked Mulgate, in a more gentle tone, as though he had a deeper interest in the direction he had indicated.  \"She is at home, and was at the supper table with us.\"  \"How does she seem to be?\" asked the stranger.  \"First rate; she is as jolly as though no one ever heard of such a thing as war,\" replied Corny, with enthusiasm.  \"Did she say anything about her stay at Glenfield?\" inquired Mulgate, whose interest seemed to mount to the pitch of anxiety.  \"Not a word; she did not even hint at Glenfield, or anything connected with it,\" answered Corny; and, after the sharp tones of the other, he seemed to take pleasure in thorning him with negative answers.  \"Did she say anything about me?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"Didn't she mention my name?\"  \"She did not.\"  \"Didn't she ask about my health, or want to know where I was?\"  \"Florry did not allude to you in any manner. If she wanted to know where you were, she did not say a word about it to me,\" replied Corny, in the most decided tones.  It was still light enough to see that there was something like a frown on the brow of Mr. Mulgate. He had evidently believed that the daughter of the millionnaire of Bonnydale was interested in him, and his inquiries indicated that he expected her to ask about him; but she had not made the remotest allusion to him. Besides, she was as jolly as she had been at Glenfield, when war was a matter of the future, which few believed would ever be realized. She had not grown thin and pale during her absence from him, and she did not appear to be wasting her sweetness in pining for him.  \"What in the world are you talking about, Mulgate?\" suddenly demanded his companion on his side of the fence. \"I thought we were here for business, and you are talking about some girl.\"  \"She is the lady of whom I spoke to you; she spent the last winter with her uncle at the Glenfield Plantation. I am interested in her,\" replied Mulgate, as though he had given a sufficient excuse for the questions he had put to Corny.  \"Are we to capture her and take her back to the State of Alabama?\" demanded the other, who seemed to be a gentleman of forty at least.  \"I don't know; that depends; but, Captain Carboneer, I hope you will be my friend in this little matter,\" added Mulgate.  \"I don't know any thing about the little matter; but I am not willing to jeopardize the enterprise that brings us here to help you out with a love affair,\" replied the older gentleman. \"There will be time enough for you to look for a wife after the war is over, and you have more time to attend to the affair.\"  \"Mr. Mulgate, I should like to know something more about your intentions before we go any farther,\" interposed Corny, in a tone so decided that Mulgate had to listen to him, especially as he had obtained so little sympathy from the elderly gentleman.  \"Speak quick then, for we have no time to spare,\" added Mulgate.  \"Do I understand from what you have said that you intend to take Florry Passford back to the South with you?\" asked Corny, with his teeth closely pressed together, so that it was rather difficult for him to speak intelligibly.  \"I answer, as I did before, that I don't know what I shall do; that depends,\" replied Mulgate evasively.  \"Depends upon what?\"  \"I have no time to discuss that matter now,\" added Mulgate, turning to his companion.  \"But I have time to say that I will ruin the whole enterprise if you mean to commit an outrage such as you appear to have in your mind,\" replied Corny, as vigorously as though he had been the military equal of the one he had called \"major\" by accident.  \"Do you mean to be a traitor to your country, Neal?\" demanded Mulgate angrily.  \"Neither to my country nor to my uncle.\"  \"Your uncle is a Yankee, and is doing all he can to subjugate the free South. He has no rights which we are bound to respect,\" said Mulgate fiercely.  \"This will never do,\" interposed Captain Carboneer; and this may or may not have been his real name. \"We are getting into a disagreement at the very first step of our enterprise.\"  \"I don't know you, Captain Carboneer, but I wish to be understood as meaning every word I have said; and I will wreck this enterprise, if I am shot for it, rather than allow my cousin to be carried off in connection with it,\" protested Corny stoutly. \"I will do my duty faithfully; but I will not assist in robbing my uncle of his daughter.\"  \"You are quite right, young man; and I would rather be sent to the fort as a prisoner of war than take part in such an enterprise,\" added Captain Carboneer, in mild but forcible tones.  \"You astonish me, captain!\" said Mulgate. \"Why do you talk about an outrage? I claim to be a gentleman, and to be above any such villainy as you and Corny suggest. I do not propose to rob Captain Passford of his daughter. What I may do depends--depends upon the consent of the lady. If she is willing to go with me\"--  \"She is not willing to go with you; and she never will be willing to go with you,\" Corny interposed. \"I don't know what you are thinking about, Mr. Mulgate; but Florry cares no more about you than she does about Uncle Pedro, my father's house-servant. She saw you both at Glenfield, and I can't tell which she likes best.\"  \"We had better drop the subject,\" added Captain Carboneer.  \"Drop it, then,\" replied Mulgate sullenly. \"Get over the fence, Corny. Nobody is using that sailboat, and we may as well take it for a while.\"     CHAPTER III  THE DIGNIFIED NAVAL OFFICER   Corny climbed over the high palisade fence, with the assistance of Mulgate, and the party walked to the sailboat at the beach below. By this time it was dark, though the gloom was not very dense under a clear sky.  \"Do you know anything about this boat, Corny?\" asked Mulgate, as the trio approached the handsome craft, for such she was beyond a doubt.  The crusty tones of the speaker indicated that he had not yet recovered from the set-back he had plainly received in the late conversation, though he denied that he had any evil intentions in regard to Miss Florry.  \"I do; I know all about her,\" replied Corny.  \"Well, why don't you tell what you know?\" demanded Mulgate.  \"What do you wish to know about her?\" inquired Corny, who was disposed to maintain his equality in spite of the military rank of his companion, which he had incautiously betrayed in the beginning.  \"Whose boat is it?\" asked Mulgate.  \"She belongs to my cousin, Christy Passford.\"  \"Where is he now?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"Was he at the house when you were there?\"  \"He was not; and his mother had become rather anxious because he did not return to supper,\" replied Corny, becoming a little more pliable.  \"This is a rather large boat, Captain Carboneer,\" added Mulgate, as he surveyed the trim sloop. \"She is rather too large for our purpose.\"  \"She will answer very well,\" replied the captain, as he applied his shoulder to the stem of the craft to ascertain how heavily she rested upon the beach. \"Now, do you know whether there is any person on board of that steamer?\"  \"Of course, I don't know anything about it,\" said Mulgate.  \"I am sure I don't,\" added Corny.  \"I sent you up here to ascertain all about the Bellevite,\" continued Mulgate, rather sharply.  \"I have not had time to find out anything,\" Corny explained, with some indignation in his tones.  \"Corny has done as well as he could in the time he has had to do it in,\" interposed Captain Carboneer.
