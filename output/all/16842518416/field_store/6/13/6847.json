For, these words of Christ created the Catholic Apostolate and maintain it.  His words, indeed, are words of life.  The Apostolate of the Church is an absolute necessity, the very condition of Her existence and progress.  The Catholic Church Extension is one of the most beautiful expressions of that Apostolate, for its object is, as we stated, the conservation and propagation of the Faith in the Mission districts of Canada.  The principles upon which the activities of this Society are based may be reduced to two: the _doctrinal_ and the _historic_:  1. _Doctrinal Principle_.--All appeals for sympathy and help in the great cause of Catholic Missions rest on one of the most fundamental doctrines of our Faith, the Catholicity of the Church.  \"The Church Catholic,\" says the great theologian Suarez, \"means the Church Universal--_Ecclesiam esse catholicam, idem est ac esse universalem_\" (Disput. de Ecclesia IX., sect. VIII., No. 5).  This universality of Christ's Church implies the idea of solidarity, whereby in her living and indivisible unity She is always and everywhere the same.  The Church, like a perfect vital organism, is a divine organic whole, solidly constituted, identical to itself, and in all its parts, throughout time and space.  The whole is reflected or rather found in each part, and each part reflects and possesses the whole.  The Catholicity of the Church is but the expansion of its Unity.  It stands therefore as its permanent and outward manifestation.  Should we now wonder why the Church of Christ is called Catholic?  We name things and persons by that characteristic feature which conveys to our mind the most accurate concept of them.  The very name of the Church is, as you see, an ever living proof of her divinity.  And of that name, we may well say what is said of the name of Jesus . . . _signum cui contradicetur_ . . . it will be forever \"a sign of contradiction.\"  The moral aspect of this solidarity of the Church is responsibility. The Church at large is responsible for each particular diocese and parish, and each individual diocese and parish is in return responsible for the Church universal.  This responsibility is to be shared by every Catholic.  And as by its Catholicity the Church overcomes the two great barriers to all human power, time and space, so also should every Catholic manifest in the affairs of the Church universal an interest equally as great as that he shares in his own particular parish. \"Co-operation among Catholics,\" as Archbishop McNeil justly remarked, \"is more than a means to a missionary end.  It is an essential part of Catholic life.  Boundaries of jurisdiction are conveniences and means to an end.  In the first century of the Christian era, it was centres rather than circumferences that marked divisions of work and jurisdiction; but in any case administrative divisions were never intended to be divisions of brotherhood.  The divisions of the Church into dioceses and parishes are to further increase, and not to weaken or destroy its Catholicity.\"  And what we say of these divisions of space, may also be said of those of time.  As the glorious memories of the divine history of the Church belong to each individual Catholic, so also should the possibilities of her future destinies in our country and throughout the world, preoccupy his thoughts and affections in the present.  This is one of the most comprehensive and most pregnant aspects of the Church.  It throws open the whole world to the zeal of every individual Catholic.  Wherever the tents of Israel are, there he finds his home, be it in the wilds of Africa, or on the islands of Oceanica, under the scorching sun of the tropics or in the snows of the lonely North.  But as we are more closely united with those among whom Divine Providence has cast our lot in this world, our home-missions have the first claim on our zeal and generosity.  For, according to St. Thomas Acquinas, the more or less close relationship with our neighbor is the measure of the _intensity_ of our love and devotedness.  We now understand what the Church Extensions' claim means for the missions of Canada.  The intention of the Society, as we may readily see, is not to limit our zeal to any national issue, but rather, to develop more easily the missionary spirit and direct its first effort to the welfare of our own countrymen by the consideration of our own wants.  2. _Historic Principle_.--The lesson of facts is very often more striking than that of doctrine.  They are here the concrete expression, in the various nations, and through the course of centuries, of those fundamental principles we have just considered.  It is indeed a law of Catholic History, that the more Catholic a nation is, the more apostolic, the more missionary it will prove itself to be.  The missionary spirit is the test of Catholicity, the abiding proof of its solidarity.  The history of Catholic nations justifies this statement; their zeal for the propagation of the faith will explain their rise and downfall in the eyes of the Church.  Ireland is a classical illustration of this point.  Poor, persecuted, downtrodden, the land of the Gael still remains the seminary of the world's apostles.  The foreign missions always appealed to the Irish people and \"the limits of the earth have heard the voice\" of its zealous missionaries.  Does not France, notwithstanding the persecution of the Church by its government, still remain the great missionary country of the world?  She sends more missionaries and gives more monetary aid to the \"Propagation of the Faith\" than any other Catholic nation.  England's return to Catholicism is most promising, for her converts of yesterday are already in the field afar.  The awakening of that same apostolic spirit in the Church of the United States is the most convincing sign of the great strides Catholicity is making in that land of Liberty.  This unwritten law which prevails throughout the history of Catholic nations and expresses so forcibly and so persistently the doctrinal principle of which we spoke, justifies the claims of the Catholic Extension and gives strength to its appeal.  Such are the two principles upon which rest the Extension Society--_dogma_ and _history_.  They strike the very bed-rock of our Faith.  But if its _principles_ are sublime and inspiring--its _policy_ is simple and effective.   _II.--Policy_  The policy of an organization is the direction of its activities, the plan of campaign for the furtherance of its principles, the line of action in the realization of its ideal.  _The Policy of the Church Extension is twofold: education and action_.  To give to all the Catholics of our country, an accurate knowledge of conditions in our various mission fields, to develop in them the true missionary spirit, to make them think in terms of the Church Universal . . . this is its _educational policy_.  To organize in every parish a branch of the Society and through it to enlist the sympathy and receive the spiritual and financial assistance of every member, to develop, co-ordinate and direct the missionary activities of all our dioceses in favor of our home missions; in other words, to promote efficiency through organization, centralization of efforts with the least waste of energy . . . this is its _policy of action_.  1. _Policy of Education_.--The acuteness of our sense of duty depends largely on the breadth and depth of our vision.  This principle explains the importance of the Catholic Extension educational policy. Through its official organ, \"The Catholic Register,\" by means of pamphlets, leaflets, and lectures and sermons, the Society is most intent on giving to the Catholics of Canada, first hand knowledge of conditions in our mission districts.  We are perfectly convinced that when all our Catholics will have fully realized the truth of these conditions, they will immediately understand their responsibilities and fulfill generously their duty.  But what is that \"call of the West\" which the Catholic Church Extension is sounding like a cry of alarm through the country?  You all know, what I would call, \"the Romance of the West.\"  A few decades ago Western Canada was but a bleak, lifeless plain, extending from the Great Lakes to the foothills of the Rockies, dotted here and there with the Indian wigwam, the roving herds of buffaloes, the solitary chapel of the Catholic missionary, and the lonely posts of the Hudson Bay fur-traders.  Suddenly under the magic steel of the plough, that immense waste of land woke up from its age-long slumber. The desolate prairie became within a few years the greatest granary of the world.  The Indian trail gave place to transcontinental highways, to those \"long, long, and winding,\" steel trails that have led the youth of our Country and the exiles of Europe \"into the lands of their dreams.\"  These trans-Canada roads have conquered distances and linked the Atlantic to the Pacific.  They may well be considered as the arteries of our Dominion; through them indeed flows rapid and warm the blood of our national life and in them one can hear, as it were, the pulsations of its great and noble heart.  The transcontinental lines are responsible for the birth and phenomenal growth of our Prairie Provinces.  What are the conditions of the Church in these new and promising Provinces?  It is not the time, nor is it the place to discuss errors or absence of policy that have crippled the Church's work and growth in that period of rapid transformation.  We take facts as they are now. The Church in Western Canada to hold its ground, to extend its work and develop its institutions, has an absolute need of the help of the East. The barrier of immense distances to which are added, for long months, unfavorable climatic conditions; diversity of nationality, variety of racial ideals, differences of language, customs and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18378"],["title","Catholic Problems in Western Canada (#8)"],["body","s; absence of Catholic traditions and a prevailing atmosphere of unbelief and irreligion; such are, in a few words, the tremendous obstacles against which the Western Church in its infancy has to contend.  This vision of distress, the Extension wishes to place before every Catholic in Canada; this call for help, it wishes him to hear.  But particularly the _future_ of the Church in these Provinces forms the subject of the Extension's preoccupations.  We all realize the vast possibilities of our Western Provinces, and the important part they must of necessity play in the future affairs of our Dominion.  The Church's influence then will be what we make it by our efforts now, and its progress will be in exact proportion to the amount of our foresight.  This responsibility of the _present_ and the _future_, the Church Extension preaches to all in season and out of season.  Like the beacon by the sea, it is ever turning its revolving lights over the immense uncharted ocean of our Western missions and hopes that with time, every Catholic in Canada will take his course on them.  For, let us not forget it, if we do not take care of our mission districts, others will, and that to the detriment and loss of the Church.--_Fas est ab hoste doceri_!  It is permissible, says the proverb, to receive a lesson from an enemy.  Only those who have worked out West on the missions know to what extent unscrupulous and most aggressive proselytizers are always on the ground, ever at work among our people. They are digging broad and deep trenches around the settlements of our Catholic foreigners, particularly Ruthenians, draining to their profit the dormant energies of the new Canadian.  The invasion is slow but sure, the leakage, great and continual.  This lesson that comes from the tremendous activities of the various Protestant denominations should strike home more forcibly.  The more stinging the lash, the more sudden the rebound.  This educational policy of the Church Extension appeals to the Catholic mind and tells it something it desires to know.  It awakens that latent Catholicity which Baptism has given us and on which the narrow limitations of time and space have no claim.  This education of our Catholic laity in the value and necessity of the missionary spirit, in the perfect knowledge and true appreciation of its character in the Church of God, is the end and result of the Extension policy.  To make that spirit the inspiring, guiding and testing power of Catholic life, is the definite aim of its educational work, of its publicity campaign. When our laity will have absorbed the lesson, it will be ready for action.  This knowledge will awaken our sense of responsibility and prompt our sympathetic support.  This leads us to say a word on the Society's policy of action.  2. _Policy of Action_.--Vision resolves itself into action.  When the mind sees deep and clear, the heart feels warm and generous, the will acts promptly and decisively.  As the spark leaps bright and sharp from the silent battery, ignites the fuel and drives the piston, so will a broad vision give a generous impulse to action.  You readily see the value of an educational policy, and its intimate connection with that of action.  Action to be efficient and lasting must be organized.  Grouping of forces, co-ordination of efforts, are what we need most in the Church of Canada.  In the rank and file of the laity, hidden treasures of enthusiasm, latent powers of energy go to waste, because there is no leader to awaken them, or if aroused, no organization to direct them. The policy of the Catholic Extension is to bring to vigorous activity these long slumbering desires, to give an effective vent to the pent up energies of the Catholic heart, to group all Catholic missionary work for the conservation and propagation of the Faith in our mission districts.  Have we not been working too much as separate units?  Has not our zeal been limited by the boundaries of our parishes and dioceses?  What activities have been absorbed by side-issues, while the great cause of the Church at large should have occupied our attention!  We were deliberating . . . and the West was being lost to us!  The time has come to rally around the Church in our mission fields and prove ourselves worthy of our name--\"Christian\" and our surname--\"Catholic.\" The policy, therefore, of the Extension is to enlist the organized effort of every parish, of every diocese in a great missionary movement, and to throw the weight of the Catholic influence of the East into the immense field of our Western missions.  It is not for the promotion of any project, for the benefit of any particular section of the Church in Canada, that the Extension Society exists.  True genuine Catholicity is the only inspiration of its activities.  This united action will manifest itself first and above all in _prayer_.  The preservation of the Faith, and the conversion of souls are supernatural works depending primarily and in the final analysis on the grace of God.  Never has it been more necessary to emphasize this trait of the Catholic Aspostolate.  Confronted with elaborate schemes of finance and the co-operative action of various denominations, we may take lessons from them, but should never forget that there is something more fundamental; we mean, the grace of God.  Our prayer--the prayer of every child, the prayer of every man and woman within the fold, the prayer of every nun and priest, should be the prayer of the Master to the Heavenly Father: \"Send harvesters into the fields!\"  How powerful should not that prayer be!  How strong a binding link between the East and the West!  But prayer, like faith, without works is dead.  The Extension, therefore, not only solicits our prayers, but also our help to meet the needs of our home-missions--_Men and money_, financial aid and apostolic vocations, these are the needs of the hour.  Money to build chapels, schools, orphanages, hospitals; money to help the Catholic press, the spreading of Catholic Literature; money to forward the great and vital cause of higher education.  This organized financial assistance of the Church in the East, as a whole, as a corporate body, is the best expression of the reality and sincerity of Catholic solidarity.  To boast of our beautiful churches and sumptuous cathedrals in the East and to leave our priests in the West without a decent chapel to say Mass denote either painful ignorance of actual facts or the fallacy of our Catholicity.  Great is the need of money, but greater still the need of men.  The principal work of the Extension is to foster, develop and bring to fruition missionary vocations for the West.  Burses are founded to assist young men in their studies, and in a few years, it is the hope of the Extension to be able to send to every diocese of the West zealous harvesters for the harvest that is awaiting them beyond the Lakes.  Could we be invited to share a more noble task than to contribute to the education of the heralds of the Gospel, of the ambassadors of Christ to that Western Kingdom of ours?  Let us conclude.  These are the _principles_ on which rests the Church Extension Society; this is the _policy_ it pursues.  The adoption of these principles and the furtherance of this policy will, we are confident, develop the true type of the Catholic Laity.  The parish, its works, its pastor, will be the first to benefit by this missionary spirit of the laity.  Long enough has the priest, the missionary, laboured alone in the harvest field and borne the heats of the day; long enough have but a few loyal and generous souls shouldered the burden of the missionary work in Canada; long enough have our Catholics limited their zealous efforts to the confines of their parish or their diocese.  The time has come for every Catholic in Canada to answer the call of the Master, to take his place in the harvest field, to share the responsibilities of the present and prepare a glorious future for the Church in our great and prosperous Dominion.  The appeal that comes to the Church of Canada from the Catholic Extension is straightforward.  It needs no apology.  It stands its ground on its own merits.  It is not--let us never forget it--an appeal to our charity.  It is a pressing call to accomplish a sacred duty, a timely warning not to neglect it.  And indeed, active co-operation in the work of Extension is, we repeat, an unfaltering belief in the reality of our Catholicism.  It knits our soul to the very soul of the Church, our heart to Her heart.  Strengthened by these highest motives of Catholic Solidarity and Christian Charity we should give joyfully and generously.  Let us levy a tax on our income, no matter how small it may be, remembering the fiduciary character of our earthly possessions.  Let us give our time and our services to this noble Cause.  Let us give lovingly and willingly our children to the great harvest, if it be God's will to call them to His service.  But above all let us pray that the Kingdom of Jesus Christ may come in our beloved Country through the Extension of His divine Church.

PRO ARIS ET FOCIS[1]  Militancy is the characteristic feature of God's Church on earth.  New dangers, fresh struggles await Her at every turn of the road in Her onward march to eternity.  Assailed from within by her own children, attacked from without by bitter enemies, she is ever working out through the frailties of human nature her sublime destiny.  Not of this world, but passing through it, She has necessarily to suffer from the inherent weakness of her children.  It is the human side of the divine Church.
