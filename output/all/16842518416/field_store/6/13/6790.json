Thence were ten years worn by     When unto that hidden river a man-child drew anigh,     And he looked and beheld how Sigmund wrought on a helm of gold     By the crag and the stony dwelling where the Dwarf-kin wrought of old.     Then the boy cried: \"Thou art the wood-wight of whom my mother spake;     Now will I come to thy dwelling.\"                                       So the rough stream did he take,     And the welter of the waters rose up to his chin and more;     But so stark and strong he waded that he won the further shore:     And he came and gazed on Sigmund: but the Volsung laughed, and said:     \"As fast thou runnest toward me as others in their dread     Run over the land and the water: what wilt thou, son of a king?\"      But the lad still gazed on Sigmund, and he said: \"A wondrous thing!     Here is the cave and the river, and all tokens of the place:     But my mother Signy told me none might behold that face,     And keep his flesh from quaking: but at thee I quake not aught:     Sure I must journey further, lest her errand come to nought:     Yet I would that my foster-father should be such a man as thou.\"      But Sigmund answered and said: \"Thou shalt bide in my dwelling now;     And thou mayst wot full surely that thy mother's will is done     By this token and no other, that thou lookedst on Volsung's son     And smiledst fair in his face: but tell me thy name and thy years:     And what are the words of Signy that the son of the Goth-king bears?\"      \"Sinfiotli they call me,\" he said, \"and ten summers have I seen;     And this is the only word that I bear from Signy the Queen,     That once more a man she sendeth the work of thine hands to speed,     If he be of the Kings or the Gods thyself shalt know in thy need.\"      So Sigmund looked on the youngling and his heart unto him yearned;     But he thought: \"Shall I pay the hire ere the worth of the work be       earned?     And what hath my heart to do to cherish Siggeir's son;     A brand belike for the burning when the last of its work is done?\"      But there in the wild and the thicket those twain awhile abode,     And on the lad laid Sigmund full many a weary load,     And thrust him mid all dangers, and he bore all passing well,     Where hardihood might help him; but his heart was fierce and fell;     And ever said Sigmund the Volsung: The lad hath plenteous part     In the guile and malice of Siggeir, and in Signy's hardy heart:     But why should I cherish and love him, since the end must come at last?      Now a summer and winter and spring o'er those men of the wilds had       pass'd.     And summer was there again, when the Volsung spake on a day:     \"I will wend to the wood-deer's hunting, but thou at home shalt stay,     And deal with the baking of bread against the even come.\"      So he went and came on the hunting and brought the venison home,     And the child, as ever his wont was, was glad of his coming back,     And said: \"Thou hast gotten us venison, and the bread shall nowise       lack.\"      \"Yea,\" quoth Sigmund the Volsung, \"hast thou kneaded the meal that       was yonder?\"     \"Yea, and what other?\" he said; \"though therein forsooth was a wonder:     For when I would handle the meal-sack therein was something quick,     As if the life of an eel-grig were set in an ashen stick:     But the meal must into the oven, since we were lacking bread,     And all that is kneaded together, and the wonder is baked and dead.\"      Then Sigmund laughed and answered: \"Thou hast kneaded up therein     The deadliest of all adders that is of the creeping kin:     So tonight from the bread refrain thee, lest thy bane should come       of it.\"      For here, the tale of the elders doth men a marvel to wit,     That such was the shaping of Sigmund among all earthly kings,     That unhurt he handled adders and other deadly things,     And might drink unscathed of venom: but Sinfiotli so was wrought,     That no sting of creeping creatures would harm his body aught.      But now full glad was Sigmund, and he let his love arise     For the huge-limbed son of Signy with the fierce and eager eyes;     And all deeds of the sword he learned him, and showed him feats of war     Where sea and forest mingle, and up from the ocean's shore     The highway leads to the market, and men go up and down,     And the spear-hedged wains of the merchants fare oft to the       Goth-folk's town.     Sweet then Sinfiotli deemed it to look on the bale-fires' light,     And the bickering blood-reeds' tangle, and the fallow blades of fight.     And in three years' space were his war-deeds far more than the deeds       of a man:     But dread was his face to behold ere the battle-play began,     And grey and dreadful his face when the last of the battle sank.     And so the years won over, and the joy of the woods they drank,     And they gathered gold and silver, and plenteous outland goods.      But they came to a house on a day in the uttermost part of the woods     And smote on the door and entered, when a long while no man bade;     And lo, a gold-hung hall, and two men on the benches laid     In slumber as deep as the death; and gold rings great and fair     Those sleepers bore on their bodies, and broidered southland gear,     And over the head of each there hung a wolf-skin grey.      Then the drift of a cloudy dream wrapt Sigmund's soul away,     And his eyes were set on the wolf-skin, and long he gazed thereat,     And remembered the words he uttered when erst on the beam he sat,     That the Gods should miss a man in the utmost Day of Doom,     And win a wolf in his stead; and unto his heart came home     That thought, as he gazed on the wolf-skin and the other days waxed       dim,     And he gathered the thing in his hand, and did it over him;     And in likewise did Sinfiotli as he saw his fosterer do.     Then lo, a fearful wonder, for as very wolves they grew     In outward shape and semblance, and they howled out wolfish things,     Like the grey dogs of the forest; though somewhat the hearts of kings     Abode in their bodies of beasts. Now sooth is the tale to tell,     That the men in the fair-wrought raiment were kings' sons bound by a       spell     To wend as wolves of the wild-wood, for each nine days of the ten,     And to lie all spent for a season when they gat their shapes of men.      So Sigmund and his fellow rush forth from the golden place;     And though their kings' hearts bade them the backward way to trace     Unto their Dwarf-wrought dwelling, and there abide the change,     Yet their wolfish habit drave them wide through the wood to range,     And draw nigh to the dwellings of men and fly upon the prey.      And lo now, a band of hunters on the uttermost woodland way,     And they spy those dogs of the forest, and fall on with the spear,     Nor deemed that any other but woodland beasts they were,     And that easy would be the battle: short is the tale to tell;     For every man of the hunters amid the thicket fell.      Then onwards fare those were-wolves, and unto the sea they turn,     And their ravening hearts are heavy, and sore for the prey they yearn:     And lo, in the last of the thicket a score of the chaffering men,     And Sinfiotli was wild for the onset, but Sigmund was wearying then     For the glimmering gold of his Dwarf-house, and he bade refrain from       the folk,     But wrath burned in the eyes of Sinfiotli, and forth from the       thicket he broke;     Then rose the axes aloft, and the swords flashed bright in the sun,     And but little more it needed that the race of the Volsungs was done,     And the folk of the Gods' begetting: but at last they quelled the war,     And no man again of the sea-folk should ever sit by the oar.      Now Sinfiotli fay weary and faint, but Sigmund howled over the dead,     And wrath in his heart there gathered, and a dim thought wearied his       head     And his tangled wolfish wit, that might never understand;     As though some God in his dreaming had wasted the work of his hand,     And forgotten his craft of creation; then his wrath swelled up amain     And he turned and fell on Sinfiotli, who had wrought the wrack and       the bane     And across the throat he tore him as his very mortal foe     Till a cold dead corpse by the sea-strand his fosterling lay alow:     Then wearier yet grew Sigmund, and the dim wit seemed to pass     From his heart grown cold and feeble; when lo, amid the grass     There came two weazles bickering, and one bit his mate by the head,     Till she lay there dead before him: then he sorrowed over her dead:     But no long while he abode there, but into the thicket he went,     And the wolfish heart of Sigmund knew somewhat his intent:     So he came again with a herb-leaf and laid it on his mate,     And she rose up whole and living and no worser of estate     Than ever she was aforetime, and the twain went merry away.      Then swiftly rose up Sigmund from where his fosterling lay,     And a long while searched the thicket, till that three-leaved herb       he found,     And he laid it on Sinfiotli, who rose up hale and sound     As ever he was in his life-days. But now in hate they had     That hapless work of the witch-folk, and the skins that their bodies       clad.     So they turn their faces homeward and a weary way they go,     Till they come to the hidden river, and the glimmering house they know.      There now they abide in peace, and wend abroad no more     Till the last of the nine days perished, and the spell for a space       was o'er,     And they might cast their wolf-shapes: so they stood on their feet       upright     Great men again "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#8)"],["body","aforetime, and they came forth into the light     And looked in each other's faces, and belike a change was there     Since they did on the bodies of wolves, and lay in the wood-wolves'       lair,     And they looked, and sore they wondered, and they both for speech       did yearn.      First then spake out Sinfiotli: \"Sure I had a craft to learn,     And thou hadst a lesson to teach, that I left the dwelling of kings,     And came to the wood-wolves' dwelling; thou hast taught me many things     But the Gods have taught me more, and at last have abased us both,     That of nought that lieth before us our hearts and our hands may be       loth.     Come then, how long shall I tarry till I fashion something great?     Come, Master, and make me a master that I do the deeds of fate.\"      Heavy was Sigmund's visage but fierce did his eyen glow,     \"This is the deed of thy mastery;--we twain shall slay my foe--     And how if the foe were thy father?\"--                                       Then he telleth him Siggeir's tale:     And saith: \"Now think upon it; how shall thine heart avail     To bear the curse that cometh if thy life endureth long--     The man that slew his father and amended wrong with wrong?     Yet if the Gods have made thee a man unlike all men,     (For thou startest not, nor palest), can I forbear it then,     To use the thing they have fashioned lest the Volsung seed should die     And unavenged King Volsung in his mound by the sea-strand lie?\"      Then loud laughed out Sinfiotli, and he said: \"I wot indeed     That Signy is my mother, and her will I help at need:     Is the fox of the King-folk my father, that adder of the brake,     Who gave me never a blessing, and many a cursing spake?     Yea, have I in sooth a father, save him that cherished my life,     The Lord of the Helm of Terror, the King of the Flame of Strife?     Lo now my hand is ready to strike what stroke thou wilt,     For I am the sword of the Gods: and thine hand shall hold the hilt.\"      Fierce glowed the eyes of King Sigmund, for he knew the time was come     When the curse King Siggeir fashioned at last shall seek him home:     And of what shall follow after, be it evil days, or bliss,     Or praise, or the cursing of all men,--the Gods shall see to this.       _Of the slaying of Siggeir the Goth-king._      So there are those kings abiding, and they think of nought but the day     When the time at last shall serve them, to wend on the perilous way.     And so in the first of winter, when nights grow long and mirk,     They fare unto Siggeir's dwelling and seek wherein to lurk.     And by hap 'twas the tide of twilight, ere the watch of the night       was set     And the watch of the day was departed, as Sinfiotli minded yet     So now by a passage he wotted they gat them into the bower     Where lay the biggest wine-tuns, and there they abode the hour:     Anigh to the hall it was, but no man came thereto,     But now and again the cup-lord when King Siggeir's wine he drew:     Yea and so nigh to the feast-hall, that they saw the torches shine     When the cup-lord was departed with King Siggeir's dear-bought wine,     And they heard the glee of the people, and the horns and the       beakers' din,     When the feast was dight in the hall and the earls were merry therein.     Calm was the face of Sigmund, and clear were his eyes and bright;     But Sinfiotli gnawed on his shield-rim, and his face was haggard and       white:     For he deemed the time full long, ere the fallow blades should leap     In the hush of the midnight feast-hall o'er King Siggeir's golden       sleep.      Now it fell that two little children, Queen Signy's youngest-born,     Were about the hall that even, and amid the glee of the horn     They played with a golden toy, and trundled it here and there,     And thus to that lurking-bower they drew exceeding near,     When there fell a ring from their toy, and swiftly rolled away     And into the place of the wine-tuns, and by Sigmund's feet made stay;     Then the little ones followed after, and came to the lurking-place     Where lay those night-abiders, and met them face to face,     And fled, ere they might hold them, aback to the thronging hall.      Then leapt those twain to their feet lest the sword and the murder fall     On their hearts in their narrow lair and they die without a stroke;     But e'en as they met the torch-light and the din and tumult of folk,     Lo there on the very threshold did Signy the Volsung stand,     And one of her last-born children she had on either hand;     For the children had cried: \"We have seen them--those two among the       wine,     And their hats are wide and white, and their garments tinkle and       shine.\"     So while men ran to their weapons, those children Signy took,     And went to meet her kinsmen: then once more did Sigmund look     On the face of his father's daughter, and kind of heart he grew,     As the clash of the coming battle anigh the doomed men drew:     But wan and fell was Signy; and she cried:                                                 \"The end is near!     --And thou with the smile on thy face and the joyful eyes and clear!     But with these thy two betrayers first stain the edge of fight,     For why should the fruit of my body outlive my soul tonight?\"      But he cried in the front of the spear-hedge; \"Nay this shall be far       from me     To slay thy children sackless, though my death belike they be.     Now men will be dealing, sister, and old the night is grown,     And fair in the house of my fathers the benches are bestrown.\"      So she stood aside and gazed: but Sinfiotli taketh them up     And breaketh each tender body as a drunkard breaketh a cup;     With a dreadful voice he crieth, and casteth them down the hall,     And the Goth-folk sunder before them, and at Siggeir's feet they fall.      But the fallow blades leapt naked, and on the battle came,     As the tide of the winter ocean sweeps up to the beaconing flame.     But firm in the midst of onset Sigmund the Volsung stood,     And stirred no more for the sword-strokes than the oldest oak of the       wood     Shall shake to the herd-boys' whittles: white danced his war-flame's       gleam,     And oft to men's beholding his eyes of God would beam     Clear from the sword-blades' tangle, and often for a space     Amazed the garth of murder stared deedless on his face;     Nor back nor forward moved he: but fierce Sinfiotli went     Where the spears were set the thickest, and sword with sword was blent;     And great was the death before him, till he slipped in the blood and       fell:     Then the shield-garth compassed Sigmund, and short is the tale to tell;     For they bore him down unwounded, and bonds about him cast:     Nor sore hurt is Sinfiotli, but is hoppled strait and fast.      Then the Goth-folk went to slumber when the hall was washed from blood:     But a long while wakened Siggeir, for fell and fierce was his mood,     And all the days of his kingship seemed nothing worth as then     While fared the son of Volsung as well as the worst of men,     While yet that son of Signy lay untormented there:     Yea the past days of his kingship seemed blossomless and bare     Since all their might had failed him to quench the Volsung kin.      So when the first grey dawning a new day did begin,     King Siggeir bade his bondsmen to dight an earthen mound     Anigh to the house of the Goth-kings amid the fruit-grown ground:     And that house of death was twofold, for 'twas sundered by a stone     Into two woeful chambers: alone and not alone     Those vanquished thralls of battle therein should bide their hour,     That each might hear the tidings of the other's baleful bower,     Yet have no might to help him. So now the twain they brought     And weary-dull was Sinfiotli, with eyes that looked at nought.     But Sigmund fresh and clear-eyed went to the deadly hall,     And the song arose within him as he sat within its wall;     Nor aught durst Siggeir mock him, as he had good will to do,     But went his ways when the bondmen brought the roofing turfs thereto.      And that was at eve of the day; and lo now, Signy the white     Wan-faced and eager-eyed stole through the beginning of night     To the place where the builders built, and the thralls with       lingering hands     Had roofed in the grave of Sigmund and hidden the glory of lands,     But over the head of Sinfiotli for a space were the rafters bare.     Gold then to the thralls she gave, and promised them days full fair     If they held their peace for ever of the deed that then she did:     And nothing they gainsayed it; so she drew forth something hid,     In wrappings of wheat-straw winded, and into Sinfiotli's place     She cast it all down swiftly; then she covereth up her face     And beneath the winter starlight she wended swift away.     But her gift do the thralls deem victual, and the thatch on the hall       they lay,     And depart, they too, to their slumber, now dight was the dwelling       of death.      Then Sigmund hears Sinfiotli, how he cries through the stone and saith:     \"Best unto babe is mother, well sayeth the elder's saw;     Here hath Signy sent me swine's-flesh in windings of wheaten straw.\"      And again he held him silent of bitter words or of sweet;     And quoth Sigmund, \"What hath betided? is an adder in the meat?\"     Then loud his fosterling laughed: \"Yea, a worm of bitter tooth,     The serpent of the Branstock, the sword of thy days of youth!     I have felt the hilts aforetime; I have felt how the letters run     On each side of the trench of blood and the point of that glorious one.     O mother, O mother of kings! we shall live and our days shall be sweet!     I have loved thee well aforetime, I shall love thee more when we meet.\"      Then Sigmund heard the sword-point smite on the stone wall's side,     And slowly mid the"]]]
