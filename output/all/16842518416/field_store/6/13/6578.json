And then I'd have them cannibals jest trot that old man right round to every saloon and rum-hole he had rented and wuz a partner in the proceeds, and make him lay to and empty out every barrel and hogset of whiskey and beer and cider, and make him do the luggin' and liftin' his own self.  \"And then I'd let them Hottentots drive him round a spell to all the houses of infamy in which he wuz in partnership, and I'd make him haul some matches out of his pockets and set fire to 'em, and burn 'em all down, every one of 'em.  \"And then I'd let the old man set down and rest a spell, and let them heathens instruct him and teach him a spell their way of man-eatin'. And I'll bet after a while they could git the old man up to their level, so if he sot out to kill a man, he would jest kill him, and not destroy his soul first. For he hain't upon a level with 'em now,\" sez I, a-lookin' firm and decided at my pardner.  And he sez, \"I shouldn't think you would dast to talk so about Uncle Sam; you have always pretended to like him--you would never bear to hear a word agin him.\"  \"Wall,\" sez I, \"it is because I like him that I want him to do right. Do you spoze a mother don't like a child when she spanks him for temper, or blisters him for croup, or gives him worm-wood for worms?  \"I love that old man, and wish him awful well, and when I see him so noble and sot up in lots of things, it jest makes me mad as a hen to see him so awful mean and little in others.  [Illustration: \"I love that old man, and wish him awful well.\"]  \"I wouldn't think I liked him half so well if I sot down and see him stalk right on to his own ruin, and not try to stop him.  \"Do you spoze a ma would set and let the child she loved throw himself into the fire because he got mad? No; she would haul him back, and the more he kicked and struggled the more she would hang on, and like as not spank him.  \"I want this country to be the Light of the World, the favored of Heaven, and the admiration of all the different nations that will camp round it at the Christopher Columbus Exhibition. But they can't be expected to uphold no such doin's as these, let alone admirin' of 'em.\"   Sez Josiah, \"It beats all how wimmen will run on if a man gits drunk. Why don't you pitch into him, instead of blamin' the Goverment?\"  And I sez, \"If you go to work to move a tree you don't pull on the top branches. Of course they are more showy and easy to git holt of. But you have to dig the roots out if you want to move the tree.\"  Josiah looked real indifferent. He hain't like me in lots of things; he is more for dabblin' on the surface than divin' down under the water for first causes, and he spoke up the minute I had finished my last words, and sez he--  \"Krit and Thomas Jefferson are a-comin' here to dinner; they are goin' up to Zoar on business, and are a-goin' to stop as they come back. And I should think it wuz about time you got sunthin' started.\"  And I sez, \"The boys a-comin' here to dinner! Why'e--why didn't you tell me so?\"  And I got right up and went to makin' a lemon puddin'.     CHAPTER IV.   I knew Thomas J. wuz a-layin' out to go up to Zoar some day that week to see about a young chap to stay in his office while he wuz at the World's Fair, and it seemed that Krit had gone along for company and for the ride.  Them two young fellers love to be together. They are both as smart as whips--the very keenest, snappiest kind of whips.  Wall, I laid out to git a good dinner, that wuz my calm intention; and I sent out Josiah Allen to ketch two plump pullets, I a-layin' out to stuff 'em with the particular kind of dressin' that Thomas J. is partial to. It is a good dressin'.  And then I wuz a-layin' out to have some nice mashed-up potatoes, some early sweet peas, some lemon puddin', besides some coffee, jest as Thomas J. likes it--rich, golden coffee, with plenty of cream in it; and then besides I wuz goin' to have one or two vegetables that Josiah liked, and some jellys, etc., that Krit wuz particular fond of. Oh, I wuz goin' to have a good dinner, there hain't a doubt of that! Oh, and I wuz goin' to have some delicious soup too, to start off the dinner with! I got the receipt of Job Pressley's wife and improved on it, (though I wouldn't want her to know I said it, she is jealous dispositioned.) But I did.  Wall, if you'll believe it, jest as I wuz a-finishin' my dressin', addin' the last ingregient to it, and my mind wuz all on a strain to have it jest right--  All of a sudden Josiah Allen rushed in all out of breath, and hollered to me for a rope.  \"A rope?\" sez I, bein' took aback.  \"Yes, a long, stout rope,\" sez he, a-standin' still and a-breathin' hard. Why, he looked that wild and agitated and wrought up, that the idee passed through my mind:  Is that man a-contemplatin' suicide? Does he want to hang himself?  But, as I sez, the idee only jest passed through my fore-top; it didn't find any encouragement to stay--it went through on the trot, as you may say.  No, my noble-minded pardner never would commit suicide, I knew. But his looks wuz fearful, and I sez, almost tremblin'--  \"What do you want the rope for? I don't know of any rope, only the bed-cord up in the old chamber.\"  At these words, that agitated, skairt man rushed right upstairs, I a-follerin' him, summer-savory still in my hands, and fear and tremblin' in my mean.  And I see him dash up to the old bedstead in the attick, dash off the bedclothes and the feather-bed, and beginnin' oncordin' of it.  I then laid hands on him, and commanded him to desist.  \"I won't desist,\" sez he, \"I won't desist.\"  There wuz I, still a-holdin' him by the back of his frock--he had on his barn clothes.  \"Then do you tell your pardner the meanin' of your actions imegetly and to once.\"  \"I hain't got time,\" sez he, and oh! how he wuz onriddlin' that old bedstead of the rope; the fuzz fairly flew offen the rope as he yanked it through them holes, and twice I wuz hit by it voyalently in my face, as I strove to hold him, and elicit some information out of him.  But I could git nothin' but hard breathin' and muttered oathes till the bed-cord wuz all onloosened, and then he gathered it over his arm and started on the run for the door, I a-follerin'.  And then I see that there stood Old Bobbet, Sime Yerden, Deacon Sypher, and, in fact, most all the men in the neighborhood and some beyend it, some from the Loontown road, and some from over towards Shackville. There wuz more'n twenty of 'em.  And I sez, and I almost fainted as I sez it--  \"Has another war broke loose, or is it a wild animal from a circus? Tell me, oh, tell me what it is!\"  And one on 'em hollered, \"It is a wild beast in human shape, but he won't be a wild beast much longer!\"  And he pinted to the rope he had on his arm.  And I see then the fearful meanin' hangin' round that bed-cord. I see that others had 'em, and I see that hangin' wuz about to take place and ensue. And I besought Josiah Allen \"to pause, to stay a little, to tell me what it all meant, to not take the law into his own hands.\"  I poured out words like a flood, I wuz inkoherent in the extreme, and my words wuz vain.  But Josiah Allen--oh, how that man loves me! He darted back, throwed a paper at my feet, and hollered--  \"That will explain, Samantha!\" And then he wuz gone; I see 'em divide into four parties, and go towards the woods, and towards the hills, and towards the creek, and towards the beaver medder, each party havin' a rope, and I sez solemn like, before I thought--  \"May God have mercy on your poor soul!\"  I spoze I meant the one they wuz after, and mebby I meant them that wuz after him, I don't know; I wuz too inkoherent and wrought up to know what I did mean.  But I know I sot down and read that paper as quick as I could find my specks. And I well remember that after huntin' high and low for 'em and all over the house with tremblin' knees and shaky hands cold as a frog's, I found 'em on my own fore-top, and I sot right down in my tracts and read.  Well, it wuz enough to melt the heart of a stun, a granit stun, and as I sot there and read, the tears jest run down my face in a stream; why, they fell so that they wet the front of my gingham dress wet as sop, and ontirely onbeknown to me.  But I kep a-thinkin' to myself, \"Oh, that poor little creeter! Oh, them poor, poor creeters that loved her! Oh, that poor mother!\" And then anon I would say to myself, \"Oh, what if it wuz my Tirzah Ann! What if it wuz the Babe! Oh, that villian; may the Lord punish him!\"  And that is jest the way I sot, and wept, and cried, and cried and wept.  You see, the way it wuz, there wuz a sweet little girl, only ten years old, decoyed by a lyin' excuse from her warm, cosey home at midnight by a villian, and took through the snowy, icy streets to her doom.  Her little cold body wuz found in an empty old barn, and her destroyer, her murderer, had fled. But men wuz on his tracts, the hull country wuz roused, and they wuz huntin' him down, as if he wuz a wild animal, as indeed he wuz.  But anon, as I read the paper over again, I see these words--\"The man was intoxicated.\"  And then I begun to weep on the other end of my handkerchief (metafor).  And then, when other accounts come out, and the man wuz ketched, he swore, and swore solemn, too, that he did not remember one single solitary thing after he left that saloon where he got his drink till he sobered up and found himself by the side of that little dead body.  And other witnesses swore that they see him drunk as a fool before he sot out on his murderous and worse than murderous assault.  But from the time of the first tidings that come of the deed that had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18091"],["title","Samantha at the World's Fair (#8)"],["body","ne--though the excitement wuz more rampant that I ever knew it to be, and every single man in the community wuz out bloodthirsty for his death, and every party a-carry-in' a rope to hang him, and every woman a-lookin' out eager to see him hung, and all on 'em a-cursin' him, and a-weepin' over what he had done--  Durin' all this time, not one word did I hear uttered agin the cause of his crime, agin the man who sold him what made him a murderer, and worse, or the man that supplied the saloon with this damnable liquid.  No, not a single word did I hear from a Jonesvillian, male or female. And not one word from my pardner, though his excitement wuz so extreme that that night, jest about dusk, he rushed out thinkin' that he had got the murderer, and throwed the rope round Deacon Sypher, who had come over to borrow an auger. And once in a similer way he ketched Old Bobbet, his excitement and zeal wuz so rampant and intense.  [Illustration: He rushed out and throwed the rope around Deacon Sypher.]  Them old men wuz mad as hens, and cause enough they had, though they forgive him when they see what a state he wuz in, and they jest about as bad themselves.  But not a word from them, nor from any one did I hear durin' the hull time the excitement rained--and oh! how it did rain--about the cause of the crime.  Not one man waded in and dived down into the deep undercurrent of causes, that strange deep that underlays all human actions.  And once durin' the last day's hunt for the murderer, who wuz hidin' round somewhere--it wuz spozed in the woods--I see as I looked out of my kitchen winder, at a party headed for our swamp, one man fur more ferocious actin' than any I had seen; he wuz a-hollerin' wilder, and he carried a fur longer rope.  And I asked my companion who that man wuz that acted madder and fur more fiercer than any of the rest and more anxious to git holt of the escapin' man, so he could be hung up to once to the highest tree that could be found.  I hearn him say that right out of my own kitchen winder--I hearn him say--  \"We won't wait for no law; if we only ketch him we will hang him up so high that the buzzards can't git him.\"  And then he yelled out savage and fierce and started off on a run for the swamp, the rest of the men applaudin' him up high, and follerin' on after him.  And Josiah told me that wuz the saloon-keeper up to Zoar.  Sez I, \"The very man that sold that poor sinner the licker on that night?\"  \"Yes,\" sez Josiah.  \"Wall,\" sez I, \"the rope ort to be used on his own neck.\"  And Josiah Allen acted awfully horrified at my idee, and asked me \"if I wuz as crazy as a loon?\"  And sez he, \"He has been one of the fiercest ones to head him off that has been out.\"  And I sez dryly--dry as a chip, \"He wuzn't so fierce to head him off the night he sold him the whiskey and hard cider.\" Sez I, \"That headin' off would have amounted to sunthin'.\"  And agin I sez, \"The rope ort to be used on his own neck, if it is on anybody's, his and Uncle Sam's.\"  And agin Josiah Allen asked me, \"If I wuz as crazy as a dumb loon and a losin' my faculties--what few of 'em you ever had,\" sez he.  And I sez, \"The two wuz in partnership together, and they got the man to do the murder.\" Sez I, \"Most all the murders that are done in this country are done by that firm--the Goverment and the Saloon-keeper. And when their poor tools, that they have whetted up for bloodshed, swing out through their open doors and cut and slash and mow down their ghastly furrows of crime and horrer, who is to blame?\"  And Josiah turned over the almanac to the yeller cover and perused it, so's to show his perfect and utter indifference and contempt for my words.  Wall, they ketched the man a day or two after, about sundown. He had been a little ahead of his pursuers, a-dodgin' 'em this way and that way, jest like a fox a-dodgin' a pack of hounds.  His old rubber boots wuz all wore offen him, his clothes hangin' in rags and tatters where he had rushed through the woods and swamps, his feet and hands all froze. Half starved, and almost idiotic with fear and remorse and the effects of the poisoned licker and doctored cider he had drinked, he wuz the most pitiful and wretched-lookin' object I ever see in my hull life.  And it happened he wux took a little over a mile from us, and he wuz brung right by our door.  There wuz some officers in the party, so they interfered and kep the mob from hangin' him right up by the neck.  They said they had to hold that saloon-keeper to keep his hands offen him, and they said that in spite of all he did git the rope round him.  But the officers interfered, and after that they had to hold the saloon-keeper to keep him from the prisoner.  And I sez, when Josiah was a-praisin' up the saloon-keeper's zeal, and how the officers had to hold him--  I sez, \"It is a pity the officers didn't hold him in the first place, and then all the horrer and tragedy might have been saved.\"  But my pardner wouldn't even notice a thing I said. He felt, I could see, that my remarks wuz indeed beneath his notice.  Wall, I stood and see this poor, weak, despairin' victim of rum dragged off to a felon's doom, dragged off to the scaffold, and one of his chief draggers wuz the one that caused his crime--caused it accordin' to law. And the rest of his draggers wuz the ones who had voted to have the trade of murderer makin' and child killin' and villian breedin' perpetuated and kep up.  And the Goverment of the United States hung him, the same Goverment that wuz in partnership with that saloon up in Zoar, and took part of the pay for makin' this man murder that innocent little girl.  Wall, Josiah and me, we went to that funeral. I felt that I must go, and so did he; it wuz only about five milds from here, in the Methodist Episcopal Meetin'-House up to Zoar.  Her father and mother wuz members in good standin'. Lots of Jonesvillians went to the funeral; there hadn't been such a excitement in Zoar and Jonesville sence Seth Widrik murdered his wife's mother with a broad axe (and that wuz done through whiskey, so they say; it wuz done before my time).  The Meetin'-House in Zoar wuz crowded to its utmost capacity and the ceilin'. And seats wuz sot in all the aisles, and the pulpit stairs wuz full of folks, and the door-steps, and the front yard wuz packed full. We went early, and got a seat.  [Illustration: Wall, Josiah and me, we went to that funeral.]  All the ministers of Zoar, and Jonesville, and Loontown, and Shackville wuz there, and of all the sermons that wuz preached--wall, it wuz a sight. The tears jest run down most everybody's face, and when the mourners wuz addressed, why, big, hefty men all round me jest boohooed right out. Why, it wuz enough to melt a stun.  Then the preacher depictered that little golden head that had made sunshine in her home through the darkest days, as bein' brung low by an asassin. Then he spoke of that sweet little silvery voice a-ringin' through the home and the hearts of her father and mother, of how it wuz lifted up in vain appeal to her slayer that dretful night.  Then he spoke of the tender white arms that clung so lovingly round her parent's neck, how they wuz lifted up in frantic appeal and vain to her destroyer that bleak night, and wuz now folded up to be lifted no more till she met that man at the bar of God. And then the little arm would be raised and point him out \"murderer.\" The sweet eyes, full of God's avenging wrath, would smite him as accursed from God's presence forever.  And then he depictered it all how she would be taken to His own heart by Him \"who said that He would carry the lambs in His bosom.\" And this poor wounded lamb, He would hold more tenderly than any other, while the murderer! the villian! the asassin! would be hurled downward into everlasting burning, where he would dwell forever and forever in the midst of unquenchable flames, in partial payment of that deed of hisen.  Why, when he said them last words about the prisoner, folks looked so relieved and pleased that their tears almost dried.  And the saloon-keeper, who sot right in front of me, hollered out--\"Amen, amen, so mote it be!\"  He wuz a Methodist, he had a right to holler. And folks looked approvin' at him for it.  But I didn't--no, fur from it. I kep up a-thinkin' what I read--  \"That the prisoner wuz a good-hearted man, only drink made a fiend and a fool of him.\" And that he said solemn \"that he did not remember one thing that had taken place after he had taken his three first drinks up in that saloon, till he sobered up and found himself in that deserted old barn, with the little dead body by his side, little delicate creeter, dead and frozen, with all of the black future of desperate remorse and agony for him a-lookin' at him in the stare of her open blue eyes.\"  Sweet little forget-me-not eyes, like two spring violets frozen in a drift of snow. What strange things I read in 'em, with my tears a-fallin' fast onto 'em!  They seemed full of mute questionin'. They seemed to be lookin' up through the blue sky clear up to God's throne. They seemed to almost compel a answer from divine justice as to what wuz the cause of her murder. To appeal dumbly to the God of Justice and Mercy to wipe out this curse from our land--the curse that wuz causin' jest such murders, and jest such agonies, all over our land--sendin' out to the gallows and down to perdition jest such criminals.  The little coffin had to be put out in the yard, as I say, so the crowd could walk past it.  And there the little golden head and white face lay for 'em all to see. But nobody seemed to see in 'em what I see. For amongst the many curses of the murderer that I heard, not one word did I hear about the man that caused the murder, about the voters and upholders of that man, about the Goverment that wuz in partnership with that man and went shares with him, and for the sake of a few cents had dealt out that agony, that shame, and that criminality.
