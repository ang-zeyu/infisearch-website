I am an innocent young fellow of sixteen, and I don't like to have others playing tricks on me. Who told you my name, if you please?\"  \"No one told me your name; and I don't know yet what it is, though I have asked it of you.\"  \"Oh, get away with you! You are playing off something on me which I don't understand, and I think I had better bid you good-morning,\" added Christy, as he started to move off.  \"Then you won't tell me your name. Stay a minute.\"  \"You know my name as well as I do, and you are up to some trick with me,\" protested Christy, halting.  \"'Pon my honor as a Southern gentleman, I don't know your name.\"  \"If you are a Southern gentleman, I must believe you, for I did not come from as far north as I might have come. My name is Percy Pierson,\" added Christy seriously; for he felt that this was actually war, and that the strategy that does not always or often speak the truth was justifiable.  \"Percy Pierson!\" exclaimed the real owner of the name. \"Didn't I just tell you that was my name?\"  \"Undoubtedly you did, and that is the reason why I thought you were making game of me.\"  \"But how can that be when my name is Percy Pierson?\"  \"Give it up; but I suggest that in London, where I came from, there are acres of King Streets, almost as many Queens; and, though you may not be aware of the fact, there are seven thousand two hundred and twenty-seven native and foreign born citizens of the name of John Smith. Possibly you and I are the only two Percy Piersons in the country, or in the world.\"  \"Now you say you are from London, and a little while ago you said you were from farther north than I am. Which is it?\"  \"Isn't London farther north than any Southern State?\"  \"Enough of this,\" continued Percy impatiently.  \"Quite enough of it,\" assented Christy.  \"Will you tell me what steamer that is, where she is bound, and what she is here for?\"  \"My dear Mr. Pierson, it would take me forty-eight hours to tell you all that,\" replied the representative of the Bellevite, taking out his watch. \"If you will meet me here to-morrow night at sundown, I will make a beginning of the yarn, and I think I can finish it in two days. But really you must excuse me now; for I have to dine with the Chinese admiral at noon, and I must go at once.\"  \"I can put the owner of that craft in the way of making a fortune for himself, if he is willing to part with her,\" added Percy, as his companion began to move off.  \"That is just what the owner of that steamer wants to do: he desires to part with her, and he is determined to get rid of her. I have the means of knowing that he will let her go just as soon as he can possibly get rid of her.\"  \"Then he is the man my father wants to see; that is, if the vessel is what she appears to be, for no one is allowed to go on board of her.\"  \"I am sorry to tear myself away from you, but positively I must go now; for the Chinese admiral will get very impatient if I am not on time, and I have some important business with him before dinner,\" said Christy, as he increased his pace and got away from Mr. Percy Pierson, though he was afraid he would follow him.  But he did not; instead of doing so, he began to talk with a boatman who had some kind of a craft at the landing. Christy was not in so much of a hurry as he had appeared to be, and he waited in the vicinity till he saw his Southern friend embark in a boat which headed for the Bellevite. He concluded that his communicative friend meant to go on board of her, thinking the vessel was for sale.     CHAPTER VII  A COMPLICATION AT GLENFIELD   The boat in which Christy had come on shore carried off to the steamer the last load of supplies, and she sailed in the middle of the afternoon. Captain Passford and Christy were standing on the quarter deck together; and, as the latter had not had time to tell his father his adventure before, he was now relating it.  The captain was amused with the story, and told his son that he had been approached by a gentleman who said his name was Pierson, and he was probably the father of the enterprising young man who had been so zealous to assist in the purchase of a suitable vessel for the service of the Confederates.  \"Let me alone! Take you hands off of me!\" shouted a voice that sounded rather familiar to Christy, as he and his father were still talking on the deck. \"Let me alone! I am a Southern gentleman!\"  \"I know you are,\" replied Mr. Dashington, as he appeared on deck, coming up from the companionway that led to the cabin and ward-room, holding by the collar a young man who was struggling to escape from his strong grasp. \"Don't make a fuss, my hearty: I want to introduce you to the captain.\"  \"What have you got there, Mr. Dashington?\" asked Captain Breaker, who was standing near the owner.  \"I have got a young cub who says he is a Southern gentleman; and I suppose he is,\" replied the first officer. \"But he is a stowaway, and was hid away under my berth in the ward-room.--Here you are, my jolly frisker: and that gentleman is the captain of the steamer.\"  As he spoke, the officer set his victim down rather heavily on the deck, and he sprawled out at full length on the planks. But he was sputtering with rage at the treatment he had received; and he sprang to his feet, rushing towards Mr. Dashington as though he intended to annihilate him. But, before he reached his intended victim, he stopped short, and eyed the tall and wiry first officer from head to foot.  He concluded not to execute his purpose upon him, for he could hardly have reached his chin if he resorted to violence. But he turned his back to the captain, so that the owner and his son did not get a look at his face. Captain Breaker walked up to him and began to question him.  \"If you are a Southern gentleman, as I heard you say you were, don't you think it is a little irregular to be hid in the ward-room of this vessel?\" was the first question the commander asked.  \"I am what I said I was, and I am proud to say it; and I don't allow any man to put his hands on me,\" blustered the prisoner.  \"But I think you did allow Mr. Dashington to put his hands on you,\" replied the captain.  \"Of course I did not know that he was a Southern gentleman when I snaked him out from under the berth,\" added the first officer.  \"I accept your apology,\" said the prisoner, coming down from his high horse with sudden energy; possibly because he felt that he had a mission on board of the steamer.  All present laughed heartily at the apology of the giant mate, and Christy changed his position so that he could see the front of the stowaway.  \"Why, that is the gentleman I met on shore,--Mr. Percy Pierson!\" exclaimed the owner's son, as soon as he saw the face of his late companion at the landing.  \"I am glad to see you again, Mr. Percy Pierson,\" said the original of that name, as he extended his hand to Christy.  \"I did not expect to meet you again so soon, and under such circumstances,\" replied he, taking the offered hand; for his father had proclaimed his own principle on board, that, though the war was not to be conducted on peace principles, it was to be carried on in an enlightened, and even gentlemanly manner, so far as he was concerned.  \"I am right glad to see you, Mr. Percy Pierson, for I think you can assist me in the object I have in view,\" said the first officer's victim, looking now as though he was entirely satisfied with himself.  \"What do you mean by calling each other by the same name?\" inquired Captain Breaker, somewhat astonished at this phase of the conversation.  \"That is the most astonishing thing in the world, that my friend here should have the same name I have; and he even thought I was playing a game upon him when I told him what my name was,\" replied Percy, laughing, and apparently somewhat inflated to find a friend on board.  \"Precisely so,\" interposed Captain Passford, before the commander had time to say any thing more about the name. \"But, as you both have the same name, it will be necessary to distinguish you in some manner, or it may make confusion while you remain on board.\"  \"I see the point, sir, though I do not expect to remain on board for any great length of time; or possibly you may not,\" answered Percy.  \"Then, I suggest that you be called simply Percy, for that is a noble name; and the other young man shall be addressed as Pierson. By doing this we shall not sacrifice either of you,\" continued the owner, who did not understand what his son had been doing.  \"I have not the slightest objection. My friend Pierson gave me some information in regard to this steamer which made me very desirous to get on board of her. That must explain why I was found here under circumstances somewhat irregular, though a true gentleman can sacrifice himself to the needs of his suffering country.\"  \"To what country do you allude, Mr. Percy?\" asked Captain Passford.  \"To _our_ country,\" replied Percy with strong and significant emphasis, as though he were sure that this would cause him to be fully understood.  \"Exactly so,\" added the owner.  \"But I see that you are sailing away from Nassau as fast as you can, and I think I had better explain my business as soon as possible,\" continued Percy, who seemed to be as confident as though he had already accomplished his purpose as hinted at in his conversation with Christy.  \"I shall have to ask you to excuse me for a few minutes, for I have a little business with the captain of the steamer and this young man,\" said Captain Passford. \"The tall gentleman who so gracefully apologized for his seeming rudeness to you will entertain you while I am absent.\"  The owner presented the tall first officer by name to his late victim, and at the same time gave him a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18579"],["title","Taken (#8)"],["body"," which Mr. Dashington understood to the effect that he was to keep the young man where he was. With a signal to his son and to the captain, he went below.  \"I do not understand this masquerade, Christy,\" said he, as he seated himself at the cabin table. \"What have you been telling this young fellow?\"  Christy had only informed his father that he had been approached by Percy, and that he had, as well as he could, evaded his questions, and he had fooled the young man. He then gave the substance of the conversation at the landing, which amused both the owner and the commander very much; though he could not recall the Chinese names, invented on the spot, which he had used.  \"All right, Christy. This young man is evidently the son of the gentleman by the name of Pierson who approached me for the purpose of purchasing the Bellevite. I went so far as to tell him that the vessel was for service in Southern waters. At any rate, he inferred that she was intended for the navy of the Confederate States, and I did not think it necessary to undeceive him. With this belief, he sought no further to buy the vessel, and I had no difficulty in shaking him off. It seems that the same mission absorbs the attention of the son, and that he has come on board to purchase the steamer.\"    [Illustration: \"Let Me alone, I am a Southern Gentleman\" (Page 81)]  \"I told him that you wanted to get rid of her, and that you would do so soon, by which, of course, I meant that she was to go into the service of the Government,\" added Christy.  \"I should not have taken this young man on board; but, as he is here, he may be of use to us. But it is necessary to conceal from him the real character of the Bellevite, and we will keep up the farce as long as we please. So far as he is concerned, Christy, you may be my nephew instead of my son.\"  Captain Passford led the way back to the deck, where they found the first officer evidently on the best of terms with his prisoner. But Mr. Dashington had been as discreet as a man could be, and Percy had not obtained a particle of information from him.  \"Now, Mr. Percy, I am at your service,\" said the owner, when he reached the deck. \"I think you said you had some business with me.\"  \"I have not the pleasure of knowing who or what you are, sir; and Mr. Dashington and my friend Mr. Pierson are all I know on board by name,\" added Percy.  \"Then you must be made better acquainted before any thing can be done,\" replied the owner, pointing to the captain of the steamer. \"Mr. Percy, this is Captain Breaker, the commander of the steamer.\"  \"And this,\" added Captain Breaker, pointing at the owner, \"is Captain Passford, who is the fortunate owner of this vessel, though she is soon to pass into other hands.\"  \"Captain Passford!\" exclaimed Percy, bowing to both gentlemen as he was presented to them. \"That is a familiar name to me; and upon my word, I thought it was Colonel Passford of Glenfield when I first looked at him.\"  \"He is my brother; but I never heard him called 'colonel' before,\" added the owner, laughing at the odd-sounding title, as it was to him.  \"Colonel Homer Passford is the name by which he is often called near his residence,\" Percy explained. \"He is the nearest neighbor of my father, Colonel Richard Pierson.\"  \"Indeed! then you probably know my brother,\" said Captain Passford, interested in spite of himself.  \"As well as I know any gentleman in the State of Alabama,\" replied Percy. \"By the great palmetto! you are Colonel Passford's brother; and I think you must know Miss Florence Passford, who has been staying all winter with her uncle.\"  \"She is my daughter,\" replied the owner with some emotion, which he could not wholly conceal when he thought of his mission in the South.  \"I have met her several times, though not often, for I have been away from home at school. But my brother, Major Lindley Pierson, I learn from my letters, is a frequent visitor at your brother's house: and they even say\"--  But Percy did not repeat what they said, though he had gone far enough to give the father of Florry something like a shock.  \"What were you about to say, Mr. Percy?\" he asked.  \"I think I had better not say it, for it may have been a mere idle rumor,\" answered Percy, who was now beginning to disclose some of his better traits of character.  \"Does it relate to my daughter, sir?\" asked the captain rather sternly; for, in the present condition of the country, he was more than ordinarily anxious about his daughter.  \"I ought not to have said any thing, sir; but what I was about to say, but did not say, does relate to Miss Florence,\" replied Percy, not a little embarrassed by the situation. \"But I assure you, sir, that it was nothing that reflects in the slightest degree upon her. As I have said so much, I may as well say the rest of it, or you will think more than was intended was meant.\"  \"That is the proper view to take of it, Mr. Percy.\"  \"It was simply said that my brother Lindley was strongly attracted to your brother's house by the presence of your daughter. That is all.\"  But the fond father was very anxious. Of course the major was a Confederate.     CHAPTER VIII  A DISCONSOLATE PURCHASER OF VESSELS   The information in regard to Florry was very meagre and very indefinite. She was a very beautiful young lady of eighteen; and it was not at all strange that a young Confederate officer should be attracted to her, though the thought of it was exceedingly disagreeable to her father, under present circumstances.  Percy evidently was not satisfied with the situation; and after he had given the information which had so disturbed the owner of the steamer, he desired to change the subject of the conversation, to which Captain Passford only assented after he realized that nothing could be ascertained from him in regard to his daughter.  \"I don't think I quite understand the situation on board of this steamer,\" said Percy, when he had told all he knew about the visits of his brother at Glenfield.  \"What further do you desire to know in regard to her?\" asked Captain Passford; for the commander, when he saw that there was a family matter involved in the conversation, was disposed to be very reticent.  \"I did not come on board of this vessel in the manner I did--I do not even know her name yet,\" continued Percy; and when he found that he was talking to a brother of Colonel Passford, he dropped all his rather magnificent airs, and became quite sensible.  \"The steamer is called the Bellevite,\" replied the owner.  \"The Bellevite. It is an odd name, but I think I can remember it. I was about to say that I did not come on board of her, as I did, without an object; for I assure you that I am high-toned enough not to do any thing in an irregular manner unless for the most weighty reasons,\" said Percy, with an anxious look directed towards the island, which was now almost out of sight.  \"I do not ask your reasons; but, if you wish to give them, I will hear all you have to say, Mr. Percy,\" replied the owner.  \"I talked with Mr. Pierson on shore; and though he was disposed at first to chaff me, and avoid giving me any information in regard to this steamer, he afterwards informed me that the gentleman who owned her intended to get rid of her as soon as he could.\"  \"And you came on board for the purpose of buying her?\" suggested Captain Passford.  \"I did not expect to buy her myself, of course; but my father is exceedingly anxious to obtain a steamer like this one, and he asked me to do what I could to obtain any information in regard to her. That was the object which brought me on board of her in a clandestine manner.\"  \"You were very zealous in meeting the wishes of your father.\"  \"More than that, I was at work in a good cause; and I think I have patriotism enough to do my duty to my country in the hour of her need,\" added the young man, with a swell of the chest.  \"After his family, a man's first duty is to his country,\" said the owner.  \"I wanted to go into the army, for I am eighteen years old; but my father insisted that I could be of more service to the Confederacy as his assistant in obtaining vessels for its use.\"  \"I understand your motives.\"  \"From what I learned from Mr. Pierson,--though I do not yet know who or what he is,\" said Percy, bestowing a smiling glance upon Christy.  \"You may look upon him as my nephew,\" added Captain Passford, glancing at his son, who gave a slight bow for the benefit of the guest on board.  \"From what I could learn from your nephew, sir, I concluded that this steamer could be bought, if I could only obtain an interview with the owner,\" continued Percy, with an inquiring glance at all who were present \"I understand you are the owner of the vessel, Captain Passford.\"  \"You are quite right: she has been my yacht since she was built, and a stronger and more able vessel was never put into the water.\"  \"Mr. Pierson gave me to understand that he was in sympathy with the Confederacy; and since I came on board, and learned that you were a brother of our nearest neighbor, I have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that you are a devoted friend of the Southern cause.\"  \"What I am, for the present, I do not feel at liberty to say,\" replied Captain Passford, who was certainly reluctant to play a double part before the young man, though he felt that the necessities of the occasion required him to do so.  \"Quite right, sir; one cannot be too cautious in these times. But it is time for me to say that I did not intend to take passage in the Bellevite, and I am sure my father will be very anxious in my absence.\"  \"May I ask how you did intend to proceed?\"  \"I can hardly tell myself, sir; but my object was to see the owner as soon as I could discover who he was. But I have found you now, Captain Passford, and I am glad to find in you a friend of our holy cause.\"  The owner only bowed; and it was as true as it could be that the representative of the intended purchaser of vessels jumped at nearly all of his"]]]
