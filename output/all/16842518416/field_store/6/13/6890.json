That such a charge could be made against the Ambrosian mode of music, with its slow movement and unmetrical lines, seems strange to us, but it was _new_--and conservatism is the same in all ages.  The great bishop carried all before him. His school of song-worship prevailed in Christian Europe more than two hundred years. Most of his hymns are lost, (the Benedictine writers credit him with twelve), but, judging by their effect on the powerful mind of Augustine, their influence among the common people must have been profound, and far more lasting than the author's life. \"Their voices sank into mine ears, and their truths distilled into my heart,\" wrote Augustine, long afterwards, of these hymns; \"tears ran down, and I rejoiced in them.\"  Poetic tradition has dramatized the story of the birth of the \"Te Deum,\" dating it on an Easter Sunday, and dividing the honor of its composition between Ambrose and his most eminent convert. It was the day when the bishop baptized Augustine, in the presence of a vast throng that crowded the Basilica of Milan. As if foreseeing with a prophet's eye that his brilliant candidate would become one of the ruling stars of Christendom, Ambrose lifted his hands to heaven and chanted in a holy rapture,--      We praise Thee, O God! We acknowledge Thee to be the Lord;     All the Earth doth worship Thee, the Father Everlasting.  He paused, and from the lips of the baptized disciple came the response,--      To Thee all the angels cry aloud: the heavens and all the powers         therein.     To Thee cherubim and seraphim continually do cry,    \"Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Sabaoth;     Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of Thy glory!\"  and so, stave by stave, in alternating strains, sprang that day from the inspired lips of Ambrose and Augustine the \"Te Deum Laudamus,\" which has ever since been the standard anthem of Christian praise.  Whatever the foundation of the story, we may at least suppose the first public singing[3] of the great chant to have been associated with that eventful baptism.  [Footnote 3: The \"Te Deum\" was first sung _in English_ by the martyr, Bishop Ridley, at Hearne Church, where he was at one time vicar.]  The various anthems, sentences and motets in all Christian languages bearing the titles \"Trisagion\" or \"Tersanctus,\" and \"Te Deum\" are taken from portions of this royal hymn. The sublime and beautiful \"Holy, Holy, Holy\" of Bishop Heber was suggested by it.   _THE TUNE._  No echo remains, so far as is known, of the responsive chant actually sung by Ambrose, but one of the best modern choral renderings of the \"Te Deum\" is the one by Henry Smart in his _Morning and Evening Service_. In an ordinary church hymnal it occupies seven pages. The staff-directions with the music indicate the part or cue of the antiphonal singers by the words Decani (Dec.) and Cantor (Can.), meaning first the division of the choir on the Dean's side, and second the division on the Cantor's or Precentor's side.  Henry Smart was one of the five great English composers that followed our American Mason. He was born in London, Oct. 25, 1812, and chose music for a profession in preference to an offered commission in the East Indian army. His talent as a composer, especially of sacred music, was marvellous, and, though he became blind, his loss of sight was no more hindrance to his genius than loss of hearing to Beethoven.  No composer of his time equalled Henry Smart as a writer of music for female voices. His cantatas have been greatly admired, and his hymn tunes are unsurpassed for their purity and sweetness, while his anthems, his oratorio of \"Jacob,\" and indeed all that he wrote, show the hand and the inventive gift of a great musical artist.  He died July 10, 1879, universally mourned for his inspired work, and his amiable character.   \"ALL GLORY, LAUD AND HONOR.\" _Gloria, Laus et Honor._  This stately Latin hymn of the early part of the 9th century was composed in A.D. 820, by Theodulph, Bishop of Orleans, while a captive in the cloister of Anjou. King Louis (le Debonnaire) son of Charlemagne, had trouble with his royal relatives, and suspecting Theodulph to be in sympathy with them, shut him up in prison. A pretty story told by Clichtovius, an old church writer of A.D. 1518, relates how on Palm Sunday the king, celebrating the feast with his people, passed in procession before the cloister, where the face of the venerable prisoner at his cell window caused an involuntary halt, and, in the moment of silence, the bishop raised his voice and sang this hymn; and how the delighted king released the singer, and restored him to his bishopric. This tale, told after seven hundred years, is not the only legend that grew around the hymn and its author, but the fact that he composed it in the cloister of Anjou while confined there is not seriously disputed.      Gloria, laus et honor Tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor,     Cui puerile decus prompsit Hosanna pium.     Israel Tu Rex, Davidis et inclyta proles,     Nomine qui in Domini Rex benedicte venis                                Gloria, laus et honor.  Theodulph was born in Spain, but of Gothic pedigree, a child of the race of conquerors who, in the 5th century, overran Southern Europe. He died in 821, but whether a free man or still a prisoner at the time of his death is uncertain. Some accounts allege that he was poisoned in the cloister. The Roman church canonized him, and his hymn is still sung as a processional in Protestant as well as Catholic churches. The above Latin lines are the first four of the original seventy-eight. The following is J.M. Neale's translation of the portion now in use:      All glory, laud, and honor,       To Thee, Redeemer, King:     To whom the lips of children       Made sweet Hosannas ring.      Thou are the King of Israel,       Thou David's royal Son,     Who in the Lord's name comest,       The King and Blessed One.    All glory, etc.      The company of angels       Are praising Thee on high;     And mortal men, and all things       Created, make reply.         All glory, etc.      The people of the Hebrews       With palms before Thee went;     Our praise and prayer and anthems       Before Thee we present.      All glory, etc.      To Thee before Thy Passion       They sang their hymns of praise;     To Thee, now high exalted       Our melody we raise.         All glory, etc.      Thou didst accept their praises;       Accept the prayers we bring,     Who in all good delightest,       Thou good and gracious King. All glory, etc.  The translator, Rev. John Mason Neale, D.D., was born in London, Jan. 24, 1818, and graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1840. He was a prolific writer, and after taking holy orders he held the office of Warden of Sackville College, East Grimstead, Sussex. Best known among his published works are _Mediæval Hymns and Sequences_, _Hymns for Children_, _Hymns of the Eastern Church_ and _The Rhythms of Morlaix_. He died Aug. 6, 1866.   _THE TUNE._  There is no certainty as to the original tune of Theodulph's Hymn, or how long it survived, but various modern composers have given it music in more or less keeping with its character, notably Melchior Teschner, whose harmony, \"St. Theodulph,\" appears in the new _Methodist Hymnal_. It well represents the march of the bishop's Latin.  Melchior Teschner, a Prussian musician, was Precentor at Frauenstadt, Silesia, about 1613.   \"ALL PRAISE TO THEE, ETERNAL LORD.\" _Gelobet Seist du Jesu Christ._  This introductory hymn of worship, a favorite Christmas hymn in Germany, is ancient, and appears to be a versification of a Latin prose \"Sequence\" variously ascribed to a 9th century author, and to Gregory the Great in the 6th century. Its German form is still credited to Luther in most hymnals. Julian gives an earlier German form (1370) of the \"Gelobet,\" but attributes all but the first stanza to Luther, as the hymn now stands. The following translation, printed first in the _Sabbath Hymn Book_, Andover, 1858, is the one adopted by Schaff in his _Christ in Song_:      All praise to Thee, eternal Lord,     Clothed in the garb of flesh and blood;     Choosing a manger for Thy throne,     While worlds on worlds are Thine alone!      Once did the skies before Thee bow;     A virgin's arms contain Thee now;     Angels, who did in Thee rejoice,     Now listen for Thine infant voice.      A little child, Thou art our guest,     That weary ones in Thee may rest;     Forlorn and lowly in Thy birth,     That we may rise to heaven from earth.      Thou comest in the darksome night,     To make us children of the light;     To make us, in the realms divine,     Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.      All this for us Thy love hath done:     By this to Thee our love is won;     For this we tune our cheerful lays,     And shout our thanks in endless praise.   _THE TUNE._  The 18th century tune of \"Weimar\" (_Evangelical Hymnal_), by Emanuel Bach, suits the spiritual tone of the hymn, and suggests the Gregorian dignity of its origin.  Karl Philip Emanuel Bach, called \"the Berlin Bach\" to distinguish him from his father, the great Sebastian Bach of Saxe Weimar, was born in Weimar, March 14, 1714. He early devoted himself to music, and coming to Berlin when twenty-four years old was appointed Chamber musician (Kammer Musicus) in the Royal Chapel, where he often accompanied Frederick the Great (who was an accomplished flutist) on the harpsichord. His most numerous compositions were piano music but he wrote a celebrated \"Sanctus,\" and two oratorios, besides a number of chorals, of which \"Weimar\" is one.

[Greek: Megalunei hê psuchê mou ton Kurion.]      Magnificat anima mea Dominum,     Et exultavit Spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo.                                       Luke 1:46-55.  We can date with some certainty the hymn itself composed by the Virgin Mary, but when it first became a song of the Christian Church no one can tell. Its thanksgiving may have found tone among the earliest martyrs, who, as Pliny tells us, sang hymns in their secret worship. We can only trace it back to the oldest chant music, when it was doubtless sung by both the Eastern and Western Churches. In the rude liturgies of the 4th and 5th centuries it must have begun to assume ritual form; but it remained for the more modern school of composers hundreds of years later to illustrate the \"Magnificat\" with the melody of art and genius. Superseding the primitive unisonous plain-song, the old parallel concords, and the simple faburden (faux bourdon) counterpoint that succeeded Gregory, they taught how musical tones can better assist worship with the beauty of harmony and the precision of scientific taste. Musicians in Italy, France, Germany and England have contributed their scores to this inspired hymn. Some of them still have place in the hymnals, a noble one especially by the blind English tone-master, Henry Smart, author of the oratorio of \"Jacob.\" None, however, have equaled the work of Handel. His \"Magnificat\" was one of his favorite productions, and he borrowed strains from it in several of his later and lesser productions.  George Frederic Handel, author of the immortal \"Messiah,\" was born at Halle, Saxony, in 1685, and died in London in 1759. The musical bent of his genius was apparent almost from his infancy. At the age of eighteen he was earning his living with his violin, and writing his first opera. After a sojourn in Italy, he settled in Hanover as Chapel Master to the Elector, who afterwards became the English king, George I. The friendship of the king and several of his noblemen drew him to England, where he spent forty-seven years and composed his greatest works.  He wrote three hymn-tunes (it is said at the request of a converted actress), \"Canons,\" \"Fitzwilliam,\" and \"Gopsall,\" the first an invitation, \"Sinners, Obey the Gospel Word,\" the second a meditation, \"O Love Divine, How Sweet Thou Art,\" and the third a resurrection song to Welsey's words \"Rejoice, the Lord is King.\" This last still survives in some hymnals.   THE DOXOLOGIES.      Be Thou, O God, exalted high,     And as Thy glory fills the sky     So let it be on earth displayed     Till Thou art here as there obeyed.  This sublime quatrain, attributed to Nahum Tate, like the Lord's Prayer, is suited to all occasions, to all Christian denominations, and to all places and conditions of men. It has been translated into all civilized languages, and has been rising to heaven for many generations from congregations round the globe wherever the faith of Christendom has built its altars. This doxology is the first stanza of a sixteen line hymn (possibly longer originally), the rest of which is forgotten.  Nahum Tate was born in Dublin, in 1652, and educated there at Trinity College. He was appointed poet-laureate by King William III. in 1690, and it was in conjunction with Dr. Nicholas Brady that he executed his \"New\" metrical version of the Psalms. The entire Psalter, with an appendix of Hymns, was licensed by William and Mary and published in 1703. The _hymns_ in the volume are all by Tate. He died in London, Aug. 12, 1717.  Rev. Nicholas Brady, D.D., was an Irishman, son of an officer in the royal army, and was born at Bandon, County of Cork, Oct. 28, 1659. He studied in the Westminster School at Oxford, but afterwards entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1685. William made him Queen Mary's Chaplain. He died May 20, 1726.  The other nearly contemporary form of doxology is in common use, but though elevated and devotional in spirit, it cannot be universal, owing to its credal line being objectionable to non-Trinitarian Protestants:      Praise God from whom all blessings flow,     Praise Him all creatures here below,     Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,     Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  The author, the Rev. Thomas Ken, was born in Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, Eng., July, 1637, and was educated at Winchester School, Hertford College, and New College, Oxford. In 1662 he took holy orders, and seventeen years later the king (Charles II.) appointed him chaplain to his sister Mary, Princess of Orange. Later the king, just before his death, made him Bishop of Bath and Wells.  Like John the Baptist, and Bourdaloue, and Knox, he was a faithful spiritual monitor and adviser during all his days at court. \"I must go in and hear Ken tell me my faults,\" the king used to say at chapel time. The \"good little man\" (as he called the bishop) never lost the favor of the dissipated monarch. As Macaulay says, \"Of all the prelates, he liked Ken the best.\"  Under James, the Papist, Ken was a loyal subject, though once arrested as one of the \"seven bishops\" for his opposition to the king's religion, and he kept his oath of allegiance so firmly that it cost him his place. William III. deprived him of his bishopric, and he retired in poverty to a home kindly offered him by Lord Viscount Weymouth in Longleat, near Frome, in Somersetshire, where he spent a serene and beloved old age. He died æt. seventy-four, March 17, 1711 (N.S.), and was carried to his grave, according to his request, by \"six of the poorest men in the parish.\"  His great doxology is the refrain or final stanza of each of his three long hymns, \"Morning,\" \"Evening\" and \"Midnight,\" printed in a _Prayer Manual_ for the use of the students of Winchester College. The \"Evening Hymn\" drew scenic inspiration, it is told, from the lovely view in Horningsham Park at \"Heaven's Gate Hill,\" while walking to and from church.  Another four-line doxology, adopted probably from Dr. Hatfield (1807-1883), is almost entirely superseded by Ken's stanza, being of even more pronounced credal character.      To God the Father, God the Son,     And God the Spirit, Three in One.     Be honor, praise and glory given     By all on earth and all in heaven.  The _Methodist Hymnal_ prints a collection of ten doxologies, two by Watts, one by Charles Wesley, one by John Wesley, one by William Goode, one by Edwin F. Hatfield, one attributed to \"Tate and Brady,\" one by Robert Hawkes, and the one by Ken above noted. These are all technically and intentionally doxologies. To give a history of doxologies in the general sense of the word would carry one through every Christian age and language and end with a concordance of the Book of Psalms.  [Illustration: Oliver Holden]   _THE TUNE._  Few would think of any music more appropriate to a standard doxology than \"Old Hundred.\" This grand Gregorian harmony has been claimed to be Luther's production, while some have believed that Louis Bourgeois, editor of the French _Genevan Psalter_, composed the tune, but the weight of evidence seems to indicate that it was the work of Guillaume le Franc, (William Franck or William the Frenchman,) of Rouen, in France, who founded a music school in Geneva, 1541. He was Chapel Master there, but removed to Lausanne, where he played in the Catholic choir and wrote the tunes for an Edition of Marot's and Beza's Psalms. Died in Lausanne, 1570.   \"THE LORD DESCENDED FROM ABOVE.\"  A flash of genuine inspiration was vouchsafed to Thomas Sternhold when engaged with Rev. John Hopkins in versifying the Eighteenth Psalm. The ridicule heaped upon Sternhold and Hopkins's psalmbook has always stopped, and sobered into admiration and even reverence at the two stanzas beginning with this leading line--      The Lord descended from above       And bowed the heavens most high,     And underneath His feet He cast       The darkness of the sky.      On cherub and on cherubim       Full royally He rode,     And on the wings of mighty winds       Came flying all abroad.  Thomas Sternhold was born in Gloucestershire, Eng. He was Groom of the Robes to Henry VIII, and Edward VI., but is only remembered for his _Psalter_ published in 1562, thirteen years after his death in 1549.   _THE TUNE._  \"Nottingham\" (now sometimes entitled \"St. Magnus\") is a fairly good echo of the grand verses, a dignified but spirited choral in A flat. Jeremiah Clark, the composer, was born in London, 1670. Educated at the Chapel Royal, he became organist of Winchester College and finally to St. Paul's Cathedral where he was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel. He died July, 1707.  The tune of \"Majesty\" by William Billings will be noticed in a later chapter.   TALLIS' EVENING HYMN.      Glory to Thee, my God, this night     For all the blessings of the light,     Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,     Under Thine own Almighty wings.  This stanza begins the second of Bp. Ken's three beautiful hymn-prayers in his _Manual_ mentioned on a previous page.   _THE TUNE._  For more than three hundred and fifty years devout people have enjoyed that melody of mingled dignity and sweetness known as \"Tallis' Evening Hymn.\"  Thomas Tallis was an Englishman, born about 1520, and at an early age was a boy chorister at St. Paul's. After his voice changed, he played the organ at Waltham Abbey, and some time later was chosen organist royal to Queen Elizabeth. His pecuniary returns for his talent did not make him rich, though he bore the title after 1542 of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, for his stipend was sevenpence a day. Some gain may possibly have come to him, however, from his publication, late in life, under the queen's special patent, of a collection of hymns and tunes.  He wrote much and was the real founder of the English Church school of composers, but though St. Paul's was at one time well supplied with his motets and anthems, it is impossible now to give a list of Tallis'"]]]
