Quis est Diāna?   2. Cuius fīlia est Diāna?   3. Quis Diānam amat?   4. Quis silvam amat?   5. Quis sagittās portat?   6. Cuius fīliae labōrant?   LESSON V  FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)    [Special Vocabulary]    NOUNS   «corō´na», _wreath, garland, crown_    fā´bula, _story_ (fable)   «pecū´nia», _money_ (pecuniary)   «pugna», _battle_ (pugnacious)   «victō´ria», _victory_    VERBS   «dat», _he (she, it) gives_    nārrat, _he (she, it) tells_ (narrate)    CONJUNCTION[A]   «quia» or «quod», _because_    «cui» (pronounced _co͝oi_, one syllable), interrog. pronoun, dat.      sing., _to whom?_ _for whom?_      [Footnote A: A _conjunction_ is a word which connects words, parts     of sentences, or sentences.]  «41.» «The Dative Case.» In addition to the relationships between words expressed by the nominative, genitive (possessive), and accusative (objective) cases, there are other relationships, to express which in English we use such words as _from_, _with_, _by_, _to_, _for_, _in_, _at_.[1]      [Footnote 1: Words like _to_, _for_, _by_, _from_, _in_, etc., which     define the relationship between words, are called «prepositions».]  Latin, too, makes frequent use of such prepositions; but often it expresses these relations without them by means of case forms which English does not possess. One of the cases found in the Latin declension and lacking in English is called the _dative_.  «42.» When the nominative singular ends in «-a», the dative singular ends in «-ae» and the dative plural in «-īs».  NOTE. Observe that the _genitive singular_, the _dative singular_, and the _nominative plural_ all have the same ending, «-ae»; but the uses of the three cases are entirely different. The general meaning of the sentence usually makes clear which case is intended.      _a._ Form the dative singular and plural of the following nouns:     «fuga», «causa», «fortūna», «terra», «aqua», «puella», «agricola»,     «nauta», «domina».  «43.» «The Dative Relation.» The dative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions _to_, _towards_, _for_.  These prepositions are often used in English in expressions of motion, such as _She went to town_, _He ran towards the horse_, _Columbus sailed for America_. In such cases the dative is not used in Latin, as _motion through space_ is foreign to the dative relation. But the dative is used to denote that _to_ or _towards which_ a benefit, injury, purpose, feeling, or quality is directed, or that _for which_ something serves or exists.      _a._ What dative relations do you discover in the following?  The teacher gave a prize to John because he replied so promptly to all her questions--a good example for the rest of us. It is a pleasure to us to hear him recite. Latin is easy for him, but it is very hard for me. Some are fitted for one thing and others for another.  «44.» «The Indirect Object.» Examine the sentence    «Nauta fugam nūntiat»,     _the sailor announces the flight_  Here the verb, «nūntiat», governs the direct object, «fugam», in the accusative case. If, however, we wish to mention the persons «to whom» the sailor announces the flight, as, _The sailor announces the flight «to the farmers»_, the verb will have two objects:    1. Its direct object, _flight_ («fugam»)   2. Its indirect object, _farmers_  According to the preceding section, _to the farmers_ is a relation covered by the dative case, and we are prepared for the following rule:  «45.» RULE. «Dative Indirect Object.» _The indirect object of a verb is in the Dative._      _a._ The indirect object usually stands before the direct object.  «46.» We may now complete the translation of the sentence _The sailor announces the flight to the farmers_, and we have    «Nauta agricolīs fugam nūntiat»  «47.» EXERCISES  First learn the special vocabulary, p. 283.  _Point out the direct and indirect objects and the genitive of the possessor._  I. 1. Quis nautīs pecūniam dat? 2. Fīliae agricolae nautīs pecūniam dant. 3. Quis fortūnam pugnae nūntiat? 4. Galba agricolīs fortunam pugnae nūntiat. 5. Cui domina fābulam nārrat? 6. Fīliae agricolae domina fābulam nārrat. 7. Quis Diānae corōnam dat? 8. Puella Diānae corōnam dat quia Diānam amat. 9. Dea lūnae sagittās portat et ferās silvārum necat. 10. Cuius victōriam Galba nūntiat? 11. Nautae victōriam Galba nūntiat.  Imitate the word order of the preceding exercise.  II. 1. To whom do the girls give a wreath? 2. The girls give a wreath to Julia, because Julia loves wreaths. 3. The sailors tell the ladies[2] a story, because the ladies love stories. 4. The farmer gives his (§22.a) daughter water. 5. Galba announces the cause of the battle to the sailor. 6. The goddess of the moon loves the waters of the forest. 7. Whose wreath is Latona carrying? Diana’s.      [Footnote 2: Observe that in English the indirect object often     stands without a preposition _to_ to mark it, especially when it     precedes the direct object.]   LESSON VI  FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)    [Special Vocabulary]    ADJECTIVES   «bona», _good_   «grāta», _pleasing_   «magna», _large, great_   «mala», _bad, wicked_   «parva», _small, little_   «pulchra», _beautiful, pretty_   «sōla», _alone_    NOUNS   ancil´la, _maidservant_   Iūlia, _Julia_    ADVERBS[A]   «cūr», _why_   «nōn», _not_    PRONOUNS   «mea», _my_; «tua», _thy, your_ (possesives)   «quid», interrog. pronoun, nom. and acc. sing., _what?_    «-ne», the question sign, an enclitic (§16) added to the first word,      which, in a question, is usually the verb, as «amat», _he loves_,      but «amat´ne»? _does he love?_ «est», _he is_; «estne»? _is he?_      Of course «-ne» is not used when the sentence contains «quis»,      «cūr», or some other interrogative word.      [Footnote A: An _adverb_ is a word used to modify a verb, an     adjective, or another adverb; as, She sings _sweetly_; she is     _very_ talented; she began to sing _very early_.]  «48.» «The Ablative Case.» Another case, lacking in English but found in the fuller Latin declension, is the _ab´la-tive._  «49.» When the nominative singular ends in «-a», the ablative singular ends in «-ā» and the ablative plural in «-īs».      _a._ Observe that the final -ă of the nominative is short, while the     final -ā of the ablative is long, as,        _Nom._ fīliă       _Abl._ fīliā      _b._ Observe that the ablative plural is like the dative plural.      _c._ Form the ablative singular and plural of the following nouns:     «fuga», «causa», «fortūna», «terra», «aqua», «puella», «agricola»,     «nauta», «domina».  «50.» «The Ablative Relation.» The ablative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions _from_, _with_, _by_, _at_, _in_. It denotes    1. That from which something is separated, from which it starts, or of   which it is deprived--generally translated by _from_.    2. That with which something is associated or by means of which it is   done--translated by _with_ or _by_.    3. The place where or the time when something happens--translated by   _in_ or _at_.      _a._ What ablative relations do you discover in the following?        In our class there are twenty boys and girls. Daily at eight       o’clock they come from home with their books, and while they are       at school they read with ease the books written by the Romans.       By patience and perseverance all things in this world can be       overcome.  «51.» «Prepositions.» While, as stated above (§41), many relations expressed in English by prepositions are in Latin expressed by case forms, still prepositions are of frequent occurrence, but only with the accusative or ablative.  «52.» RULE. «Object of a Preposition.» _A noun governed by a preposition must be in the Accusative or Ablative case._  «53.» Prepositions denoting the ablative relations _from, with, in, on_, are naturally followed by the ablative case. Among these are    «ā»[1] or «ab», _from, away from_   «dē», _from, down from_   «ē»[1] or «ex», _from, out from, out of_   «cum», _with_   «in», _in, on_      [Footnote 1: «ā» and «ē» are used only before words beginning with     a consonant; «ab» and «ex» are used before either vowels or     consonants.]    1. _Translate into Latin, using prepositions._ In the water, on the   land, down from the forest, with the fortune, out of the forests, from   the victory, out of the waters, with the sailors, down from the moon.  «54.» «Adjectives.» Examine the sentence    «Puella parva bonam deam amat»,     _the little girl loves the good goddess_  In this sentence «parva» (_little_) and «bonam» (_good_) are not nouns, but are descriptive words expressing quality. Such words are called _adjectives_,[2] and they are said to belong to the noun which they describe.      [Footnote 2: _Pick out the adjectives in the following:_ “When I     was a little boy, I remember that one cold winter’s morning I was     accosted by a smiling man with an ax on his shoulder. ‘My pretty     boy,’ said he, ‘has your father a grindstone?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said I.     ‘You are a fine little fellow,’ said he. ‘Will you let me grind my     ax on it?’”]  You can tell by its ending to which noun an adjective belongs. The ending of «parva» shows that it belongs to «puella», and the ending of «bonam» that it belongs to «deam». Words that belong together are said to agree, and the belonging-together is called _agreement_. Observe that _the adjective and its noun agree in number and case_.  «55.» Examine the sentences    «Puella est parva»,     _the girl is little_   «Puella parva bonam deam amat»,     _the little girl loves the good goddess_  In the first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18251"],["title","Latin for Beginners (#6)"],["body"," the adjective «parva» is separated from its noun by the verb and stands in the predicate. It is therefore called a _predicate adjective_. In the second sentence the adjectives «parva» and «bonam» are closely attached to the nouns «puella» and «deam» respectively, and are called _attributive adjectives._      _a._ Pick out the attributive and the predicate adjectives in the     following:  Do you think Latin is hard? Hard studies make strong brains. Lazy students dislike hard studies. We are not lazy.  «56.» DIALOGUE  JULIA AND GALBA  First learn the special vocabulary, p. 283.    I. Quis, Galba, est Diāna?   G. Diāna, Iūlia, est pulchra dea lūnae et silvārum.   I. Cuius fīlia, Galba, est Diāna?   G. Lātōnae fīlia, Iūlia, est Diāna.   I. Quid Diāna portat?   G. Sagittās Diāna portat.   I. Cūr Diāna sagittās portat?   G. Diāna sagittās portat, Iūlia, quod malās ferās silvae magnae necat.   I. Amatne Lātōna fīliam?   G. Amat, et fīlia Lātōnam amat.   I. Quid fīlia tua parva portat?   G. Corōnās pulchrās fīlia mea parva portat.   I. Cui fīlia tua corōnās pulchrās dat?   G. Diānae corōnās dat.   I. Quis est cum fīliā tuā? Estne sōla?   G. Sōla nōn est; fīlia mea parva est cum ancillā meā.      _a._ When a person is called or addressed, the case used is called     the _voc´ative_ (Latin _vocāre_, “to call”). _In form the vocative     is regularly like the nominative_. In English the name of the person     addressed usually stands first in the sentence. _The Latin vocative     rarely stands first_. Point out five examples of the vocative in     this dialogue.      _b._ Observe that questions answered by _yes_ or _no_ in English     are answered in Latin by repeating the verb. Thus, if you wished to     answer in Latin the question _Is the sailor fighting?_ «Pugnatne     nauta?» you would say «Pugnat», _he is fighting_, or «Nōn pugnat»,     _he is not fighting._   LESSON VII  THE FIRST OR _Ā_-DECLENSION    [Special Vocabulary]    NOUNS   «casa, -ae», f., _cottage_    cēna, -ae, f., _dinner_   «gallī´na, -ae», f., _hen, chicken_   «īn´sula, ae», f., _island_ (pen-insula)    ADVERBS   «de-in´de», _then, in the next place_   «ubi», _where_    PREPOSITION   «ad», _to_, with acc. to express motion toward    PRONOUN   «quem», interrog. pronoun, acc. sing., _whom?_    VERBS   ha´bitat, _he (she, it) lives, is living, does live_ (inhabit)   «laudat», _he (she, it) praises, is praising, does praise_ (laud)   «parat», _he (she, it) prepares, is preparing, does prepare_   «vocat», _he (she, it) calls, is calling, does call; invites,      is inviting, does invite_ (vocation)  «57.» In the preceding lessons we have now gone over all the cases, singular and plural, of nouns whose nominative singular ends in «-a». All Latin nouns whose nominative singular ends in «-a» belong to the First Declension. It is also called the _Ā_-Declension because of the prominent part which the vowel «a» plays in the formation of the cases. We have also learned what relations are expressed by each case. These results are summarized in the following table:  +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+ |  CASE  | NOUN           |   TRANSLATION     | USE AND GENERAL MEANING | |        |                |                   | OF EACH CASE            | +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+ |        |                |     SINGULAR      |                         | +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+ | _Nom._ | do´min-a       | _the lady_        | The subject             | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Gen._ | domin-ae       | _of the lady_,    | The possessor           | |        |                |  or _the lady’s_  |   of something          | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Dat._ | domin-ae       | _to_ or _for      | Expressing the relation | |        |                |  the lady_        |   _to_ or _for_,        | |        |                |                   |   especially the        | |        |                |                   |   indirect object       | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Acc._ | domin-am       | _the lady_        | The direct object       | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Abl._ | domin-ā        | _from, with, by,  | Separation (_from_),    | |        |                |   in, the lady_   | association or means    | |        |                |                   | (_with, by_), place     | |        |                |                   | where or time when      | |        |                |                   | (_in, at_)              | +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+ |        |                |      PLURAL       |                         | +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+ | _Nom._ | domin-ae       | _the ladies_      |                         | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Gen._ | domin-ā´rum    | _of the ladies_,  |                         | |        |                |  or _the ladies’_ |                         | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Dat._ | domin-īs       | _to_ or _for      | The same as             | |        |                |   the ladies_     |   the singular          | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Acc._ | domin-ās       | _the ladies_      |                         | |        |                |                   |                         | | _Abl._ | domin-īs       | _from, with, by_, |                         | |        |                |  _in, the ladies_ |                         | +--------+----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+  «58.» «The Base.» That part of a word which remains unchanged in inflection and to which the terminations are added is called the «base».  Thus, in the declension above, «domin-» is the base and «-a» is the termination of the nominative singular.  «59.» Write the declension of the following nouns, separating the base from the termination by a hyphen. Also give them orally.    «pugna», «terra», «lūna», «ancil´la», «corō´na», «īn´sula», «silva»  «60.» «Gender.» In English, names of living beings are either masculine or feminine, and names of things without life are neuter. This is called «natural gender». Yet in English there are some names of things to which we refer as if they were feminine; as, “Have you seen my yacht? _She_ is a beauty.” And there are some names of living beings to which we refer as if they were neuter; as, “Is the baby here? No, the nurse has taken _it_ home.” Some words, then, have a gender quite apart from sex or real gender, and this is called «grammatical gender».  Latin, like English, has three genders. Names of males are usually masculine and of females feminine, but _names of things have grammatical gender and may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter_. Thus we have in Latin the three words, «lapis», _a stone_; «rūpēs», _a cliff_; and «saxum», _a rock_. «Lapis» is _masculine_, «rūpēs» _feminine_, and «saxum» _neuter_. The gender can usually be determined by the ending of the word, and _must always be learned_, for without knowing the gender it is impossible to write correct Latin.  «61.» «Gender of First-Declension Nouns.» Nouns of the first declension are feminine unless they denote males. Thus «silva» is feminine, but «nauta», _sailor_, and «agricola», _farmer_, are masculine.  «62.» EXERCISES  First learn the special vocabulary, p. 284.  I. 1. Agricola cum fīliā in casā habitat. 2.

The farmer lives in the small cottage. 3. Who lives with the farmer? 4. (His) little daughter lives with the farmer. 5. (His) daughter is getting («parat») a good dinner for the farmer. 6. The farmer praises the good dinner. 7. The daughter’s good dinner is pleasing to the farmer.      [Footnote 1: Note that the relation expressed by the dative case     covers that _to which a feeling is directed._ (Cf. §43.)]    [Illustration]  What Latin words are suggested by this picture?  «63.» CONVERSATION  Answer the questions in Latin.    1.

LESSON VIII  FIRST DECLENSION (_Continued_)    [Special Vocabulary]    NOUNS   «Italia, -ae», f., _Italy_    Sicilia, -ae, f., _Sicily_   «tuba, -ae», f., _trumpet_ (tube)   «via, -ae», f., _way, road, street_ (viaduct)    ADJECTIVES   «alta», _high, deep_ (altitude)   «clāra», _clear, bright; famous_   «lāta», _wide_ (latitude)   «longa», _long_ (longitude)   «nova», _new_ (novelty)  «64.» We have for some time now been using adjectives and nouns together and you have noticed an agreement between them in _case_ and in _number_ (§54). They agree also in _gender_. In the phrase «silva magna», we have a feminine adjective in «-a» agreeing with a feminine noun in «-a».  «65.» RULE. «Agreement of Adjectives.» _Adjectives agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case._  «66.» Feminine adjectives in «-a» are declined like feminine nouns in «-a», and you should learn to decline them together as follows:            NOUN               ADJECTIVE   «domina» (base «domin-»),  «bona» (base «bon-»),      f., _lady_                _good_"]]]
