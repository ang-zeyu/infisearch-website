Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that almost made him shout for joy.  Within was a comely boy, tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels; and on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with a great sparkling gem.  Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his servants, without a doubt.  Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living prince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer of the pauper-boy’s heart was answered at last.  Tom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight.  Everything gave way in his mind instantly to one desire:  that was to get close to the prince, and have a good, devouring look at him.  Before he knew what he was about, he had his face against the gate-bars.  The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and London idlers.  The soldier said,--  “Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”  The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried out,--  “How dar’st thou use a poor lad like that?  How dar’st thou use the King my father’s meanest subject so?  Open the gates, and let him in!”  You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. You should have heard them cheer, and shout, “Long live the Prince of Wales!”  The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.  Edward Tudor said--  “Thou lookest tired and hungry:  thou’st been treated ill.  Come with me.”  Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don’t know what; interfere, no doubt.  But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues.  Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.  By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in books.  The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while Tom ate.  “What is thy name, lad?”  “Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”  “‘Tis an odd one.  Where dost live?”  “In the city, please thee, sir.  Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”  “Offal Court!  Truly ’tis another odd one.  Hast parents?”  “Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin sisters, Nan and Bet.”  “Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”  “Neither to any other is she, so please your worship.  She hath a wicked heart, and worketh evil all her days.”  “Doth she mistreat thee?”  “There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings.”  A fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out--  “What!  Beatings?”  “Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”  “_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little.  Hark ye:  before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father”--  “In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great alone.”  “True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her punishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?”  “Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”  “Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll’s temper.  He smiteth with a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his tongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?”  “She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort. And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”  “How old be these?”  “Fifteen, an’ it please you, sir.”  “The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you:  do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?”  “They?  Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?”  The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then said--  “And prithee, why not?  Who helpeth them undress at night?  Who attireth them when they rise?”  “None, sir.  Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep without--like the beasts?”  “Their garment!  Have they but one?”  “Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?  Truly they have not two bodies each.”  “It is a quaint and marvellous thought!  Thy pardon, I had not meant to laugh.  But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow, and that soon, too:  my cofferer shall look to it.  No, thank me not; ’tis nothing.  Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.  Art learned?”  “I know not if I am or not, sir.  The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.”  “Know’st thou the Latin?”  “But scantly, sir, I doubt.”  “Learn it, lad:  ’tis hard only at first.  The Greek is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin.  Thou should’st hear those damsels at it!  But tell me of thy Offal Court.  Hast thou a pleasant life there?”  “In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so bravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain, and ’tis so fine to see, and costeth but a farthing--albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your worship.”  “Tell me more.”  “We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel, like to the fashion of the ‘prentices, sometimes.”  The prince’s eyes flashed.  Said he--  “Marry, that would not I mislike.  Tell me more.”  “We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”  “That would I like also.  Speak on.”  “In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and shout and tumble and--”  “‘Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go on.”  “We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship’s presence.”  “Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious!  If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the crown!”  “And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just once--”  “Oho, would’st like it?  Then so shall it be.  Doff thy rags, and don these splendours, lad!  It is a brief happiness, but will be not less keen for that.  We will have it while we may, and change again before any come to molest.”  A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty.  The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been any change made!  They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at each other again.  At last the puzzled princeling said--  “What dost thou make of this?”  “Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.  It is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing.”  “Then will _I_ utter it.  Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and countenance that I bear.  Fared we forth naked, there is none could say which was you, and which the Prince of Wales.  And, now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon your hand?”  “Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms--”  “Peace!  It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince, stamping his bare foot.  “If the King--Stir not a step till I come again! It is a command!”  In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and glowing eyes.  As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars, and tried to shake them, shouting--  “Open!  Unbar the gates!”  The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway, and said--  “Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his Highness!”  The crowd roared with laughter.  The prince picked himself out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--  “I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me!”  The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--  “I salute your gracious Highness.”  Then angrily--“Be off, thou crazy rubbish!”  Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--  “Way for his Royal Highness!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1837"],["title","The Prince and the Pauper (#3)"],["body","for the Prince of Wales!”     CHAPTER IV. The Prince’s troubles begin.  After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.  As long as he had been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere. He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.  He was within the city of London--that was all he knew.  He moved on, aimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were infrequent.  He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it, and a prodigious church.  He recognised this church.  Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate repairs.  The prince took heart at once--he felt that his troubles were at an end, now.  He said to himself, “It is the ancient Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ’s Church.  Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be.”  He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and right noisily, too.  They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and ‘prentices{1}--that is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.  The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with native dignity--  “Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him.”  A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--  “Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?”  The prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip, but there was nothing there.  There was a storm of laughter, and one boy said--  “Didst mark that?  He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince himself.”  This sally brought more laughter.  Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said--  “I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my father’s bounty to use me so.”  This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.  The youth who had first spoken, shouted to his comrades--  “Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where be your manners?  Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags!”  With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did mock homage to their prey.  The prince spurned the nearest boy with his foot, and said fiercely--  “Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!”  Ah, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun.  The laughter ceased on the instant, and fury took its place.  A dozen shouted--  “Hale him forth!  To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!  Where be the dogs?  Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!”  Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and set upon and torn by dogs.  As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in the close-built portion of the city.  His body was bruised, his hands were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud.  He wandered on and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot after the other.  He had ceased to ask questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of information.  He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court--that is the name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and prove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own again.”  And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they shall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books; for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart.  I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s lesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.” {1}  The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a raw and gusty night set in.  The houseless prince, the homeless heir to the throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed together.  Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--  “Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home, I warrant me!  If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean body, then am I not John Canty, but some other.”  The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned shoulder, and eagerly said--  “Oh, art _his_ father, truly?  Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me!”  “_His_ father?  I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am _thy_ father, as thou shalt soon have cause to--”  “Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can bear no more.  Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams.  Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no lie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me!  I am indeed the Prince of Wales!”  The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and muttered--  “Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!”--then collared him once more, and said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or I’m no true man!”  With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of human vermin.     CHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.  Tom Canty, left alone in the prince’s cabinet, made good use of his opportunity.  He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince’s high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass.  Next he drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity.  Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur.  He wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home, or if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason.  At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince was gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very soon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the pretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed. Suppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince’s clothes, and the prince not there to explain.  Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?  He had heard that the great were prompt about small matters.  His fear rose higher and higher; and trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to fly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release.  Six gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed like butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him.  He stepped quickly back and shut the door.  He said--  “Oh, they mock at me!  They will go and tell.  Oh! why came I here to cast away my life?”  He walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, starting at every trifling sound.  Presently the door swung open, and a silken page said--  “The Lady Jane Grey.”  The door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him. But she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--  “Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?”  Tom’s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--  “Ah, be merciful, thou!  In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city.  Prithee let me see the prince, and he will of his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt.  Oh, be thou merciful, and save me!”  By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue.  The young girl seemed horror-stricken.  She cried out--  “O my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!”  Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down, murmuring--  “There is no help, there is no hope.  Now will they come and take me.”  Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror,"]]]
