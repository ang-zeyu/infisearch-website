Well, ther's one comfort,--shoo's gein me a shillin. Vartue is its own reward.\"     Sheffield Smook.   Mister Sydney Algernon Horne, wor a weel to do chap, as yo'll gather thro' his name, for parents dooant give ther child sich fine names unless thers a bit o' brass behind em. If owd Horne, Sydney's feyther, had been a poor warkin man, he'd ha called th' lad Tom, or Bill, or happen Mike; but as he wor a gentleman, wi Bank shares, an Cottage haase property, he dubbed th' lad Sydney Algernon as aw've telled yo. Aw think its nobbut reight at aw should tell yo at this rewl abaat names doesn't allus hold gooid, for ther's a mucky, dirty nooased, draggle-tail'd lass lives up awr yard, wi frowsy hair at couldn't be straightened wi nowt short ov a cooambin machine; shoo hasn't a hawpney to bless hersen wi, an yet shoo's called Victoria Hujaney, after th' Queen o' these lands, an Ex-Empress o'th French.  But aw must get on wi mi tale, or else yo'll happen be thinkin 'at awm nivver baan to tell it. Mister Sydney Algernon Horne faand hissen an orphan at three an twenty year owd, an th' owner o' all th' Bank Shares an th' Cottages, besides th' haase he lived in, which wor a varry nice one wi a big garden, an situated, as th' advertisements says, in the mooast salubrious pairt o' Sheffield.  He knew a deal o' fowk at Sheffield--fowk like him wi a heap o' brass; an bein a single man, an furst-rate company, he wor welcomed i' all th' big haases, a deeal moor heartily nor mooast o'th' readers o'th' Clock Almanac wod ha been. Young men made him welcome, becoss he could tell a gooid stooary an sing a song wi onny on em. Faythers an mothers o' marriageable dowters wor fain to see him, i' hopes at he'd be smitten wi th' charms o' Matilda Charlotte or Ethel Maude,--but th' lasses thersens wor fainest to see him, becoss he wor nice lukkin, an could tawk soft to em, an he used to squeeze ther hands when he wor sayin \"gooid bye,\" soa gently, at he used to mak em ivvery one think at he wor dyin ov love for em.  But Sydney wor too wide awake to be catched easy; he wor varry happy an comfortable as a bachelor, an as he'd a gooid idea at i' mooast cases it wor his brass an not him at they wanted, he steered clear o' all th' traps at they set for him; an when th' Kursmis parties wor all ovver, he wor still single--an they'd none on em getten noa forrader wi him when winter coom agean, an put a stop to Lawn Tennis an Croquet Parties.  But yo know it says i' th' gooid owd Book at it isn't \"gooid for a man to dwell alooan\"--an aw suppoas it isn't, for someha or other, sooiner or later mooast young chaps get dropt on, an Sydney wor noa excepshun to th' rewl. Aw'll tell yo hah it wor.  One snowy neet, at abaat six o'clock he wor gooin hooam to his dinner, (for swells yo must know ha ther dinners at th' time at respectable warkin fowk ha ther teahs)--He wor just passin a dark lane end, when he heard a woman's voice singin aght \"Help! Help!\"  He cut up th' rooad as fast as he could, an abaat twenty yards thro' th' corner, he seed a regular offal lukkin feller strugglin wi a young lady under a gas pooast.--As sooin as th' ruffian seed Sydney commin, he bolted ovver a wall, in a way at showed at it worn't th' furst time at he'd takken to his heels to save hissen a thrashin.  Ov cooarse as sooin as th' danger wor ovver, an ther wor noa need o' owt o't sooart, th' young lady swooned away--an it tuk Sydney all his time to bring her raand, in fact it worn't until he'd kissed her two or three times, at shoo begun o' commin to her senses.  As sooin as shoo wor able to walk, he assisted her hooam, or at least to th' haase wher shoo wor visitin. On th' way shoo tell'd him at they call'd her Mabel Mothersdale, that shoo wor stayin a wick or two wi some friends, an that shoo'd just slip aght to pop a letter into th' pillar box, when th' tramp attack'd her.  Sydney went next day to ax hah shoo wor.--Shoo wor varry fain to see him--an th' friends shoo wor stayin wi made a big fuss ov him, an axd him to stay dinner. He stayed ov cooarse.  Th' next day he called wi a piece o' music 'at he'd been tellin em abaat--th' day after he went wi some tickets for a grand concert ther wor baan to be i' Sheffield--an what wi one excuse or another, he seed her ivvery day--an ivvery neet when he doffed his clooas an gate into bed, he felt moor i' love wi Mabel nor he had done th' neet befoor.  At last th' day coom for her to goa back hooam to Brummagem, where her father lived, an when Sydney called to say \"gooid bye\" to her, he tuk th' opportunity when they wor left aloan for abaat five minutes, to ax her to marry him. Mabel wor a sensible lass, ho knew a reight chap when shoo seed one, soa shoo sed at shoo'd wed him wi pleasur if he'd get her father's consent.  \"Mother's been deead these six years,\" shoo sed, \"but befoor shoo deed aw promised her faithful at aw'd nivver marry nubdy withaat mi father wor agreeable.\"  Sydney kussed her an sed he wor quite content an he'd goa daan to Brummagem next Tuesday, an ax her father on th' Wednesday mornin, an as he wor weel to do i' money matters, noa daat ther'd be noa difficulty i' gettin th' owd feller to have him for a son i' law.  Soa Mabel went hooam wi a happy heart, an caanted th' haars wol next Wednesday, when shoo'd see her dear Sydney Algernon ageean.  Nah as aw tell'd yo befooar, Sydney wor a reight nice young feller--he wor as steady as a clock, an nubdy couldn't say nowt ageean him, nobbut for one thing, an that wor he'd getten an idea into his heead, at he couldn't possibly live baat bacca--mornin, nooin an neet, he wor hardly ivver withaat awther a pipe or a cigar in his maath, an tho' fowk tell'd him at he smooked a deeal too mich, it wor noa gooid.  \"Aw couldn't live baat a bit o' bacca,\" he used to say, \"an when th' day cooms 'at aw may'nt smook, aw shall'nt care ha sooin they shut me up in a box, an cart me off to th' burryin graand.\"  Soa yo can easy imagine 'at wi sich sentiments as these, he didn't leeave off smookin as ha fowk tawked. At last Tuesdy coom, an as th' best train for Brummagem left at five o'clock in th' afternooin, Sydney decided he'd goa by that; an as its a longish gait, ov cooarse he tuk jolly gooid care to have plenty o' smookin materials wi him.  When he gate to th' stashun, he faand aght to his disgust, 'at th' only reekin hoil on all th' train wor full, soa he gate into another carriage an decided to mak that into one, for he'd getten some slips o' paper in his pocket wi \"_Smookin_\" on, soa as he could stick one on if it wor required, haivver has nubdy else got in wi him, he didn't bother abaat puttin th' slip up. At last th' train started an glided aght o' th' leeted stashun into th' darkness aghtside, for it wor winter time, an a thick muggy afternooin, soa he lit his pipe an started readin a \"Clock Almanac\" at he'd bowt--an what wi readin th' stories, an thinkin abaat ha sooin he'd see Mabel, an fillin his pipe, he didn't nooatice where he'd getten too; when all ov a sudden th' train started gooin slower an slower, an finally stopt at a bit ov a road-side stashun, abaat as big as one o' them hot pay hoils whear lads caar ov a neet to spend ther coppers in.  As it wor a express he knew it didn't owt to stop there, an just as he wor wonderin what ther wor to do, th' door wor oppened an a little owd gentleman wi spectacles on, wor tumbled into th' same compartment whear he wor, an a leather bag wor shoved in after him--a porter touched his hat an shaated aght \"All reet!\" th' door wor slammed too, th' whistle blew, an th' train started off agean.  \"Phew! Yor smookin, sir!\" sed th' owd chap as sooin as he'd getten his breeath an lukt raand.  \"Eah!\" sed Sydney, showin a cigar at he'd leeted not a minnit befooar.  \"Aw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18176"],["title","Yorkshire Tales. Third Series (#7)"],["body","on yor puttin it aght instantly,\" sed th' owd feller.  Sydney wornt used to bein ordered abaat like this, soa he sed:  \"Oh, yo insist on it, do yo, owd buffer, but suppooas aw dooant put it aght, what then?\"  \"But you shall put it aght, an at once too,\" he went on, gettin varry red i' th' face, \"do yo think at aw shall submit to be poisoned wi yor vile, disgustin tobacca smook? sich men as yo should ride in a cattle truck or a dog box--tho' if yo wor in there yo'd be taichin th' cawves an puppies bad habbits--Owd buffer, indeed! I'll have yo fined, sir.\"  \"Nah dooan't yo get raggy,\" sed Sydney, poolin aght his cigar case, an leetin another; \"if aw have to be fined aw mud as weel have summat for my brass,\" an he moved an sat on a seat in front o'th owd chap, an puffed aght o' both cigars as fast as he could, wol he made sich a reek i'th hoil at th' lamp up aboon lukk'd like a full mooin on a misty neet.  \"Awm a director on this line,\" th' owd beggar gasped, \"an aw insist on yor desistin the smookin at once, sir.\"  \"A director are yo? awm fain to see yo, aw've often wanted to ax one o' ye gentry ha it is at th' trains is soa unpunctual on this line?\"  Th' owd chap jumped up an run to th' winder, an let it daan, an started tryin to find th' cord to stop th' train, but bi gooid luck he'd getten to th' wrang side o'th carriage, an while he wor botherin to find th' rope, Sydney opened th' t'other winder an stuck one o'th' slips wi \"Smookin\" on it, on th' aghtside oth' pane, an then he sed:  \"Aw insist on yo closin that winder, sir, th' draught annoys me, as aw've getten a bad cowd.\"  Haivver th' owd chap wodn't shut it, he kept his heead aght an cought, an it worn't till he catched seet o' Sydney sharpenin a gurt jack-knife on his booit, at he wor flayed into cloisin it. Nah it soa happened at only that varry afternooin, th' owd feller had been readin ith' paper, abaat a man havin escaped throo a mad haase somwhear or other, an it struck him at Sydney must be th' varry chap, soa he wor in sich a funk 'at he didn't know whativver to do, but he thowt th' best thing wod be to keep as still as he could, an not vex Sydney, soa he sat daan as quiet as owt an sed nowt.  \"Are yo fond o' mewsic?\" Sydney axt.  \"Varry,\" sed th' owd chap.  Soa Sydney started wavin his jack knife abaat, an bellowin a song aght o' tune, abaat Buffalo Bill, an huntin buffalos in th' wilds o' Kensington, an he stuck a verse in abaat scalpin Railway directors. In th' meeantime th' train wor gooin along at a gooid rattle, for they wor lat, an th' driver wor makkin up time, soa th' carriage started o' swingin a bit. Th' owd feller thowt he mud say summat to try an mak Sydney forget abaat scalpin directors, soa he sed:  \"Dooant yo think this trains gooin quickly, sir?\"  \"Aw wish it wod goa twenty times faster, aw wish it wod goa a thaasand times faster,\" sed Sydney, wavin his arms abaat, \"aw wish it wod goa bang into another train an smash this carriage all inter smithereens.\"  \"Why, if it did yo'd be killed!\"  \"Awd dee gladly ony day,\" Sydney answered, \"if aw could only know at a Director wor killed too.\"  An soa they went on, Sydney dooin all kind o' mad things, he even insisted on th' Director smookin three whiffs ov a cigar; but at last, like ivverything i' this world, th' journey coom to an end, an they glided into th' station at Brummagem.  As sooin as ivver th' train stopt, th' Director jumpt aght, an called for a porter, \"Get that gentleman's name,\" he sed, \"he's been smookin in this carriage.\"  Sydney wor sittin quite calmly, wi' hawf a cigar in his maath, an th' porter sed,--  \"Have yo been smookin, sir?\"  \"Ov coorse aw have, cannot yo see mi cigar, this is a smookin carriage, luk thear\"--an he pointed to th' label on th' winder.  Th' porter couldn't do anything when he seed that, but th' Director sent for th' stashun maister, an made an awful shindy; he sed 'at Sydney wor mad, an ha he'd threatened him wi' a knife, an aw dooant know what beside--but Sydney wor soa polite, an whispered to th' Stashun maister, \"at he thowt th' owd feller had had too mich to sup, for he'd been smookin hissen as they could easy find aght if they smell'd his breeath.\"  Soa th' Stashun maister sed he couldn't do owt, as it wor a smookin carriage, soa Sydney wor allowed to goa to th' Hotel, leeavin 'em to feight it aght as they liked.  Th' last thing he thowt ov that neet befooar he fell asleep wor, ha Mabel wod laugh next day when he telled her abaat it.  Next mornin when he'd had his braikfast, he donned hissen up smart as a chap owt to do when he's gooin a cooartin, an set off in a cab to Mabel's father's haase.  Th' lass wor lukkin aght for him, an after a bit o' kussin an huggin (as is suitable at sich times) Sydney sed he mud as weel see her father an get it ovver.  \"He's in th' library,\" sed Mabel.  \"Nah for it,\" Sydney sed, as they stood aghtside th' door, \"gie me another kuss, lass, to keep me up to th' mark, an eh! aw've sich a joke to tell thi abaat afterwards.\"  Mabel kussed him ageean, an then shoo oppen'd th' door an walked in, wi Sydney followin behund feelin varry uncumfortable, for its noa joke aw can tell yo axin an owd gentleman to gie yo his dowter.  Mister Mothersdale wor sittin at a table, writin a letter, when they went in an he didn't luk up till Mabel sed:--\"Papa, dear, this is Mister Horne, th' gentleman I told yo abaat, who protected me from that ruffian i' Sheffield, who tried to rob me.\"  He lukked up, and Sydney felt like to sink into his booits, for if it worn't th' varry owd chap at he'd travelled in th' train wi' th' neet befooar.  Nah tho' Sydney knew th' owd chap in a crack, by gooid luck Mabel's father hadn't his glasses on, soa he didn't mak him aght at furst.  \"Awm varry fain to mak yor acquaintance, sir,\" he sed, \"my dowter has towd me ha kind yo wor i' Sheffield, an aw wish to thank yo for it.\"  Sydney wor soa flayed ov th' owd feller rememberin his voice, 'at he shoved a hawpny into his maath befooar he spake, an then he sed:--\"Aw didn't do much awm sewer, Sir. It wor nowt at all.\"  \"Have aw ivver met yo befooar,\" Mister Mothersdale axt, \"aw seem to know yor voice?\"  \"Net as aw know on,\" Sydney answered, feelin at he wor in for a thunderin lot o' lyin.  \"Mister Horne's niver been i' Brummagem befooar,\" Mabel sed.  \"It's varry strange,\" th' owd man went on, as he put his specs on, \"aw seem to know yor voice soa weel, an dear-a-me yor face reminds me ov sumdy but aw cannot tell who.\"  Nah Sydney wor dressed quite different thro what he had th' neet befooar, an while Mabel's father wor puzzlin his heead abaat it, Mabel sed \"Aw showed yo a photograph o' Mister Horne, papa, praps that's it?\"  \"That must be it,\" Sydney sed, jumpin at th' idea soa sharp, at in spite o'th hawpny he had in his maath, he spoke quite nateral like; an though th' owd feller couldn't believe 'at this nice gradely lukkin young man, could be th' same as th' madman he'd travelled wi' th' neet befooar, th' idea coom into his heead, an th' moor he lukked, th' moor certain he grew.  \"Can yo sing,\" he axed.  \"Awm a varry poor singer,\" Sydney sed.  \"Soa wor th' chap last neet,\" thowt owd Mothersdale, but Mabel put in, \"Oh! Papa he sings as beautifully as Sims Reeves.\"  \"Then it couldn't ha been him,\" thowt her father, an then he axt:  \"Do yo know a comic song at awm varry fond ov, abaat Buffalo Bill scalpin Railway Directors in th' Wilds o' Kensington?\"  Mabel laft, an Sydney tried to laff too, as he sed:--  \"Aw nivver heeard ov it befooar, but if yor fond ov it, aw'll try an get it an sing it for yo.\"  Th' owd man wor baan to ax some mooar questions when Sydney thinkin it wor time to change th' subject, sed:--\"Aw've come, Mr. Mothersdale, to ax if yo've onny objections to\"--he'd quite forgetten abaat his voice ageean, an when he gate that far, Mabel's father begun o' beein quite sewer i' wor th' madman, an he stuck in wi:--\"Do yo happen, Mr. Horne, to have a big knife abaat yo, for aw want one for abaat hawf a minnit?\"  Sydney wor just baan to bring aght his Jack knife, but he remembered just i' time, soa he sed, \"Noa, awm sorry aw haven't, but Mister Mothersdale wod yo have onny objections to Mabel an me keepin company? Awm weel off, aw've a gooid hooam to tak her to, an awm sewer aw can mak her happy.\"  Nah ivvery word at Sydney sed made owd Mothersdale mooar sewer at he wor th' chap at he'd coom daan i'th train wi th' neet afooar. He wor awfully riled abaat it yo may be sewer, for if ther wor one thing on earth at he couldn't abide it wor th' stink o' bacca, an he'd been varry near smooared i' that railway carriage. But wol he wor as mad as a hatter abaat it, he remembered at he'd heeard Mabel say 'at this Mister Horne had heaps o' brass, soa he thowt he'd say no mooar abaat th' neet afooar, but let him wed th' lass, an tak a revenge aght ov him some other way.  Soa he started jawin away, as these better class fathers does, abaat ha he couldn't bide to part wi his dear Mabel, an soa on; but when Sydney tell'd him abaat his Bank shares, an th' cottage haase property, he sooin gave in.  \"Well,\" he sed wi a sniff, as if he'd getten a bad cowd in his heead, \"if yo booath on yo love each other soa mich, aw willn't stand in th' road o' yor happiness, but ther's one little request aw must ask yo to grant me, Mr. Horne, in return for my dowter?\"  Sydney wor soa sewted at th' way things wor gooin, at he blurted aght, \"awst be glad to promise owt yo like to ask, sir.\"  \"Awm a member o' th' Anti-tobacca Society,\" sed th' owd beggar chucklin to hissen, \"an aw hooap yo dooant indulge i' smookin or snufftakkin?\"  \"Aw do smook a little, sir, but varry little.\"  \"Then, ov cooarse as its soa little, yo willn't object to give it up in order to win Mabel's hand?\"  Poor Sydney, he'd nobbut had three cigars that mornin, an he wor fair deein to get aght an have a smook, but ther didn't seem noa escape, soa wi a sigh, he sed:--\"Varry weel, sir, aw'll give it up.\"  Owd"]]]
