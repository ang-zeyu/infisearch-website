The ancient creek apparently followed the course of a valley in the rock, the valley having become filled to a considerable depth with very fine quicksand. This concurrence of depressions in the rock surface with the watercourse shown on Viele's map was noted in so many places and the difficulties of construction were so serious at these places, that a section of the map showing the old topography along and adjacent to the station and tunnel lines is reproduced in Plate IX.  [Illustration: PLATE XI.--Long Island Shaft. Lines _A_ and _B_]  The unfavorable conditions developed at Fifth Avenue affected both the construction of the tunnels and the maintenance of adjacent buildings. It would be necessary to construct the tunnels in open cut for a large part of the way westward, causing serious inconvenience to the public; the buildings were mostly of the older class, founded in earth, but there were several modern high buildings with foundations in the same material; some of these had been built since the tunnels were planned. In view of these added risks and the increased cost of construction, the value of the three-track construction was reconsidered, and two important changes were made in the plans. The first of these was to continue the twin tunnel westward to Sixth Avenue in 32d Street, and to a point 180 ft. west of Sixth Avenue in 33d Street; the twin tunnel being 9-1/2 ft. less in height than the three-track tunnel and 9 ft. narrower, the change reduced the difficulties considerably. Where the three-track tunnel was thus eliminated, there was no longer objection to a steeper grade, so that, going eastward from the station, a grade of 0.8% in 33d Street and 0.9% in 32d Street was substituted for the original 0.4% grade. From the west line of Fifth Avenue eastward short sections with descending grades of 0.3% connect with the original 1.5% grade near Madison Avenue. The effect of these two changes--type of tunnel and grade--was to lower the roof of the tunnels at Fifth Avenue about 15 ft., which made it practicable to avoid open cutting east of Sixth Avenue.  A full account of the construction of the cross-town tunnels will be given by the Resident Engineers.  Permanent shafts were made on both sides of the East River, those in Manhattan being located a few feet east of First Avenue, and those in Long Island City being located, one in the so-called Annex Slip, the other in the pier just south of it. The two railroad lines coming from 32d Street in Manhattan, and curving to the left at Second Avenue, are about 34 ft. apart between centers at First Avenue, and it was convenient to make the shaft large enough to cover both lines. Borings had shown that the excavation for the tunnels would break out of the rock about 200 ft. east of First Avenue. It was desirable to carry the tunnel excavation eastward from the shaft in normal air far enough to permit of building at least 50 ft. of tunnel and installing air-locks, so that compressed air might be available when the rock surface was broken through. The location adopted, and shown on Plate XIII, had the further advantages that the rock surface was several feet above the level of the top of the tunnels, and access to the river for receiving and discharging materials could be had without crossing any street. Similar reasons governed the location of the north shaft for the lines from 33d Street. On the Long Island side of the river there were only two feasible locations meeting these conditions, particularly in respect to a safe thickness of rock above the tunnels, one near the pierhead line, the other just outside the bulkhead line, and for many minor reasons the latter was preferable. The center lines of each pair of tunnels were 37 ft. apart, and each shaft, therefore, was made to cross both lines of a pair, the same as on Manhattan side of the river. It was not expected, however, that the Long Island shafts could be built conveniently or the tunnels begun from them in normal air.  The decision to make the shafts of permanent construction was based not only on the desirability of having access to and egress from the tunnels near the banks of the river for convenience of the workmen or exit for passengers in case of accident, but to facilitate ventilation; these locations divide the entire lengths of tunnels east of the station into three parts, two of which were approximately 4,000 ft. each, and the other about 5,500 ft. The accident risk was believed to be very small, while much weight was given to the feature of facilitating ventilation. Further studies have enhanced the importance attached to ventilation, and it is now intended to provide appliances for mechanical ventilation at all shafts. The plans of the shafts are shown on Plates X and XI. The caissons for the shafts are of structural steel, with double walls, filled between with concrete, including a cross-wall between and parallel to the tunnels. All these structures were fitted for sinking with compressed air, if that should prove necessary.  Although borings had shown that rock would be found at all the shaft sites several feet above the tunnel level, it could not be determined in advance of excavation whether the caissons would have to be sunk to full depth; if sound, unfissured rock were found, the sinking could be stopped above the tunnel level; but, if not, the caissons, in any case, would have to be sunk far enough to permit placing a water-tight floor below the tunnels, and the tunnels themselves begun through openings in the side-walls of the caisson; such openings, therefore, closed by removable bulkheads, were provided in all caissons.  [Illustration: PLATE XII.--Typical Tunnel Sections]  As already stated, the grade of 1.5% from Fifth Avenue eastward was fixed with reference to the lowest point of the river bed in order to give the requisite cover over the tunnels at the deepest point of the channel on the west side of the reef, where the river bottom was about 60 ft. below mean high tide for a short distance. On the other hand, as the use of compressed air in building the tunnels was anticipated, an excessive depth below the water surface was to be avoided as far as possible; it was necessary, however, to continue the descending grade some further distance until the tunnels were mostly in rock, so that drainage sumps under the tunnels could be made readily. Eastward from the sumps the tunnels had a rising grade of 0.7% to the established bulkhead line on the Long Island side, giving a cover at the points where the tunnels enter rock, a short distance westward, of about 10 ft. (if the dredging plane should be fixed at some future time at 40 ft. below mean low tide, as may be reasonably anticipated). Eastward from the bulkhead line, Tunnels _A_, _B_, and _D_ have ascending grades of about 1.25%, while Tunnel _C_ rises at the rate of 1.9% in order to effect a crossing over Tunnel _B_ west of the portals. This feature was introduced in order to place the two west-bound tracks together through the Sunnyside Yard, and the heavier grade, being downward with the traffic, was not objectionable.  The arrangement of grades and tracks in the approaches and in Sunnyside Yard would require the introduction of too much detail to be taken up here, but will be dealt with in the paper on the Sunnyside Yard.  It was recognized from the inception of the project that the tunnels under the East River would be the most difficult and expensive section of the East River Division. The borings had shown a great variety of materials to be passed through, embracing quicksand, coarse sand, gravel, boulders, and bed-rock, as well as some clayey materials. (See Plate XIII.) The rock was usually covered by a few feet of sand, gravel, and boulders intermixed, but, in some places, where the rock surface was at some distance below the tunnel grade, the material met in tunneling was all quicksand; the nearest parallels in work previously done were some of the tunnels under the Thames, particularly the Blackwall tunnel, where open gravel was passed through. Before the plans for the East River tunnels were completed, work had been resumed, after many years' interruption, in the old Hudson River tunnels between 15th Street, Jersey City, and Morton Street, Manhattan, and sand materials were passed through for a short distance. These experiences satisfied nearly all the engineers in any way connected with the work that the shield method was the most suitable for the East River tunnels, and the plans for the work were based on its adoption. (See Plate XII for cross-sections, etc.) Other methods, as stated by General Raymond in the introductory paper, were advocated, particularly caisson constructions and the freezing process, the latter being urged very strongly, and, when proposals were invited, in October, 1903, bidders were informed that alternative methods would be taken into consideration.  Bids were received and opened on December 15th, 1903. Only one bidder proposed to carry out the work on the basis of unit prices, but the prices were so low that the acceptance of the proposal was deemed inadmissible; no bid based on caisson methods was received; several offers were made to perform the work by the shield method, in accordance with the plans, for a percentage of its cost, and one was submitted, on a similar basis, covering the use of the freezing method. The firm of S. Pearson and Son, Limited, of London, England, submitted a proposal for building the tunnels by the shield method, on a modification of the percentage basis, and as this firm had built the Blackwall tunnel within the estimates of cost and was the only bidder having such an experience and record in work in any way similar to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18065"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. LXVIII, Sept. 1910 (#2)"],["body"," East River tunnels, negotiations were continued between that firm and the railroad company.  The original plans and specifications contemplated that all tunnels between the First Avenue shafts in Manhattan and East Avenue in Long Island City would be shield-driven, and that work would proceed simultaneously eastward from the First Avenue shafts and both eastward and westward from the Long Island City shafts located west of Front Street at the river, requiring twelve shields. When making their proposal, S. Pearson and Son, Limited, suggested that shields might be started from the east end of the work and arrive at the Front Street shafts as soon as these shafts could be completed, and proposed sinking a temporary shaft transversely across all four lines near the east end of the work just west of East Avenue, from which, within a short time, to drive toward Front Street by the use of shields. The railroad company accepted the suggestion for the additional shaft, although the greater part of the tunnels east of Front Street was built without shields. After several months of negotiation, a contract was entered into on July 7th, 1904, with S. Pearson and Son, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of New York organized by the English firm for the purpose of entering into and carrying out this contract. The main features had been agreed upon, and work had begun about two months before. The contract embraced the permanent shafts in Manhattan and Long Island City, the tunnels between these shafts, and their extension eastward in Long Island City to East Avenue, including in all about 23,600 ft. of single-track tunnels. The contract had novel features, and seemed to be peculiarly suitable for the unknown risks and the unusual magnitude of the work. A fixed amount was named as contractor's profit. If the actual cost of the work when completed, including this sum named as contractor's profit, should be less than a certain estimated amount named in the contract, the contractor should have one-half of the saving. If, on the other hand, the actual cost of the completed work, including the fixed sum for contractor's profit, should exceed the estimated cost named in the contract, the contractor should pay one-half the excess and the railroad company the other half; the contractor's liability was limited, however, to the amount named for profit plus $1,000,000; or, in other words, his maximum money loss would be $1,000,000. Any further excess of cost was to be borne wholly by the railroad company. The management of the work, with some unimportant restrictions, was placed with the contractor; the relations of the engineer, as to plans, inspection, etc., were the same as in ordinary work, and the interest of the contractor to reduce cost was the same in kind as in ordinary work.  [Illustration: PLATE XIII.--Plan and Profile. East River Tunnels]  On account of the extent of the work embraced in this contract, and the dangerous exposure to compressed air required in most of it, it was divided into three residencies; two of these, including also the cross-town tunnels, have been described; the third, with S. H. Woodard, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Resident Engineer, embraced all tunnels from the easterly end of the work near East Avenue in Long Island City to the meeting points under the river and also the permanent shafts in Long Island City. A few months after the execution of the principal contract, the work to be done was extended eastward 107.5 ft., across East Avenue. The extensions of the tunnels were built without cast-iron linings and with an interior cross-section of the same height as the tube tunnels, but somewhat narrower. The work was also extended westward from the First Avenue shafts to include the excavation of top headings in each tunnel for a distance of 100 ft. and an enlargement to full size for 50 ft. The borings having shown that soft earth existed below the grade of the tops of the tunnel under the passenger station building of the Long Island Railroad on the east side of Front Street, and that earth of varying character would be met in places beyond the station building under the railroad tracks in the passenger yard and the street car tracks in Borden Avenue, it had been decided, before proposals were invited, to extend the metal lining eastward to East Avenue, at the east end of the work embraced in the original contract, where the rising tunnel grades approached the surface of the ground so closely that their further extension would be in open cut. In places where the tunnels were wholly in rock, the weight of the cast-iron tunnel lining was reduced 43%; where the surface of the rock was below the top of the tunnel, but above the axis, the reduction of weight was somewhat less, about 25%; notwithstanding these savings, the cost of the tunnels was probably increased by the use of the cast-iron lining; on the other hand, when passing through bad ground, a section of tunnel could be made absolutely safe more quickly by erecting the lining as soon as a length of a few feet of tunnel was ready; under a crowded passenger yard, this feature had great value.  The execution of the work under this contract will be described fully by the Resident Engineers.  The plant assembled by the contractors is believed to be the most extensive ever placed on a single piece of work, and will be described in detail by their Managing Engineer, Henry Japp, M. Am. Soc. C. E.  For convenience in receiving materials to be used in construction, and to facilitate the disposal of excavated materials, one pier was leased on the east side of the Hudson River, two on the west side of the East River and three on the east side. Excavated materials from the station, the cross-town tunnels, and the river tunnels, were placed on barges furnished by Mr. Henry Steers under several contracts embracing also the disposal of the materials. In the earlier part of the work, they were used as fill in the freight terminal of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Greenville on the west side of the Upper Bay; when the fill at this place was completed, the materials were sent to the tunnel company's yard on the Passaic, at Harrison, N. J., and a small part to the embankment in the Meadows Division. On account of the occasional closing of the Passaic by ice, this involved the possibility of, and to some extent resulted in, interruptions to the work of excavation. The contract for the cross-town tunnels carried an option in favor of the company to require the contractor for those tunnels to dispose of materials at a stated price, and in the latter part of 1907, when the excavation in these tunnels was being pushed rapidly, the railroad company, unwilling to incur the responsibility for delays during the winter, availed itself of this option. The disposal of materials was an important part of the work, and will be dealt with more fully by the Resident Engineers.  [Illustration: PLATE XIV.--Map and Profile, Cross-Town Tunnels]  At the time the contract was made with S. Pearson and Son, Incorporated, it had not been determined whether mechanical ventilation would be provided for the tunnels, and therefore the contract with that firm did not include the final concrete lining at the shafts, above the inverts of the tunnels. After the adoption of plans for mechanical ventilation, in the latter part of 1908, the plans for lining the shafts with concrete, including flues for conducting air to the tunnels, and stairways for ingress and egress, were completed, and the work was placed under contract; it will be described in detail by F. M. Green, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.  At the east end of the work under the Pearson contract, the rising grade of the tunnels brought them so near the surface of the ground that their extension eastward could be carried out more readily in open cut than by tunneling. The locations of the portals could be varied somewhat, and they were built on rock which was found in rather narrow ridges at convenient places. Tunnels _B_ and _D_ have a common portal; Tunnels _A_ and _C_ have separate ones, the portal for Tunnel _C_ being located about 800 ft, west of the others as a result of its crossing over Tunnel _B_, as already explained. Eastward from the portals, the track system expands, in order to provide connections with the tracks of the Long Island Railroad to and from Long Island City, with the New York Connecting Railroad and New England lines, and with the storage and cleaning yard known as the Sunnyside Yard extending to the west side of Woodside Avenue, 2-3/4 miles east of the East River. (Plate XV.) The yard and approaches are designed to avoid grade crossings by opposing trains. The various general features of the yard and tunnel approaches, bridge crossings, and street closings, have been described in sufficient detail by General Raymond in the introductory paper.  [Illustration: PLATE XV.--Plan and Profile of Lines _A_ and _B_, and Sunnyside Yards]  For convenience in placing the work under contract, a line was drawn 10 ft. west of Thomson Avenue, dividing the work east of that embraced in the Pearson contract into two parts. The work west of the line was placed under the immediate direction of George C. Clarke, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Resident Engineer, with Naughton Company and Arthur McMullen, Contractors; Mr. Louis H. Barker was Resident Engineer of the part east of the dividing line, with the Degnon Realty and Terminal Improvement Company as the principal contractors. The substructures of the several bridges in or across the yard were included in these contracts, but the superstructures were carried out by various bridge companies, and other minor features were executed by other contractors. More complete descriptions of the plans and of the execution of the work will be given by the Resident Engineers."]]]
