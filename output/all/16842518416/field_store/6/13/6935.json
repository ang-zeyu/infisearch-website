The engine that makes war is \"made in Germany.\" War is the national industry of the Germans, it has been developed and made perfect in Germany, it is dear to all German hearts. They are proud of it and have faith in its power. The machine must not only be stopped; it must be broken and destroyed, thrown out as scrap iron to prevent the pieces from being reassembled, readjusted and put in running order once again.  That is why France is fighting, why the whole world ought to fight to the end, to death or until victory crowns its efforts.     II  HOW FRANCE IS FIGHTING   Two words, courage and tenacity, will serve the future historian in his description of how France fought, when the time shall have come for telling the entire story of the world war.  No one has ever doubted French courage throughout all the centuries of her tormented history; but skeptical remarks have been made in times past of the tenacity of the French people.  Ten epigrams do not describe this war; nor do three. But one alone serves this purpose--know how to endure. No more thoughtful words have ever been spoken than those of the Japanese, Marshall Nogi: \"Victory is won by the nation that can suffer a quarter of an hour longer than its opponent.\"  During the four years of war, France has proven that she knew how to suffer and was able to suffer a quarter of an hour longer than her enemies.  They knew how to suffer, those soldiers of General Maunoury's army in the Battle of the Marne. And they turned the tide of battle in favor of French arms. They marched, fought and died for five days and five nights, in the passing of which some battalions marched forty-two kilometers and did not sleep for more than two hours at a time. The mobility of the fighting units was such that the commissary department was absolutely unable to supply them with rations. For three days many of them had no bread, no meat, nothing at all! They subsisted on crusts they had with them, or on the food they were able, by the fortunes of battle, to pick up in the villages where they happened to be. In spite of all this, whenever the order was given to charge, they charged the enemy with a sort of inspired madness.  \"The fight has been a hard one,\" Marshall Joffre wrote in an order of the day that will be famous throughout eternity. \"The casualties, the number of men worn out by the exhaustion due to lack of sleep--and sometimes of food--passed all imagining.... Comrades, the commander in chief has asked you to do more than your duty, and you have responded to this request by accomplishing the impossible.\" That is the finest word of praise that has been given fighting men since the world began.         *       *       *       *       *  They knew how to suffer, those other soldiers of the Battle of the Marne who were a part of General Foch's army at Fère-Champenoise. Five times they attacked the Château de Mondement, and five times they were driven back. Their officers were consulting as to the best thing to do; and the men surrounded the officers, begging them with tears in their eyes to lead them to the assault for the sixth time. For the sixth time the attack was sounded, and at the sixth assault Château de Mondement fell.  That officer at Verdun knew how to suffer. He will remain a figure for the legends of the future for, running to transmit an order, he received a bullet in the eyes which shattered his optic nerve. He was completely blinded. Nevertheless, he continued to advance, trying to grope his way through the night that had fallen upon him. He encountered something lying on the ground--a something that was a man just as badly wounded. The blind man besought him for help.  \"How can I help you,\" said the wounded man, \"a shell has broken both my legs.\"  \"What difference does that make,\" shouted the blinded man, \"I am going to carry you on my back. My legs will be yours, and your eyes will be mine.\"  And, one supporting the other, the blinded man and the lamed man carried on!         *       *       *       *       *  That officer knew how to suffer whom one of my brothers met on the battle field of Lorraine. An artillery officer, his arm was shattered, a few bits of flesh barely holding it fast to his shoulder. My brother, when he saw the man painfully dragging himself along, asked him whether or not he needed help.  \"I don't need help,\" replied the wounded man, \"but my battery down there does. It is retreating.\"  \"If it is retreating, it can't be helped and it is a waste of time for me to get it ammunition....\"  \"No,\" begged the lieutenant, \"get the munitions. We Colonials fight until the last man falls....\"  He offered to guide my brother, mounted beside him on the artillery caisson, and stayed there all day. For after he had supplied his own battery, it was the battery next it, and then the one next to that, which he wanted to supply.... Finally, in the evening, at nightfall, they came to take him off in the ambulance. The major looked at his shattered arm, examined his frightful wound, and muttered:  \"You are in a bad way. Couldn't you have come here sooner?\"  The lieutenant replied humbly:  \"Pardon me, I lost a lot of time on the way.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Those men I saw for months fighting and dying to the south of Verdun, at the Butte des Eparges, knew how to suffer.  The Butte des Eparges dominates the great plain of the Woevre, and from the very beginning it has been the theater of a frightful and long drawn out battle of the kind one seldom sees in this war. The Germans have been entrenched on the left side of the Butte, the French on the right. And day and night for four years there has been an incessant battle over its summit of grenades, bombs and shells; a terrible hand-to-hand fight in which neither one of the contestants yields an inch of ground. A brook of blood runs its interrupted course on each slope. On the south slope it is red with German blood; with French blood on the north.  The two slopes of the Butte have been so raked by firing that they have not a single tree, bush, or blades of grass on them; they stand out sinister and frightful in their nakedness, seeming to cry out to the men of the plain:  \"See, all of you, the scourge of God has passed over this place.\"  They are dented, furrowed and blown into crevasses by the explosions of mines; they are sown over with the enormous funnels in which the fighters take shelter; they are covered with an incessant smoke from the projectiles that plow them up.  As for the summit, it is a no man's land, that belongs to the dead men whose bodies cover it. The summit stopped being a battle field to become a charnel house. The number of men who have fallen there will never be known. The most fantastic figures come from the lips of those who come down ... 5,000, 8,000, 10,000 ... it will never be known. But what is known is that the dead are always there. They form a parapet above which the living fight on. These dead rot in the sunshine and in the rain. In accordance with the wind's being from the east or the west, the frightful odor of all this rotten flesh strikes the Germans or the French. They lie there, an indistinguishable mass on the ground, and the men are unlucky who watch by night in the listening posts or the trenches. They think they are stumbling against a stone, and it is a skull their feet are touching; they think they are picking up the branch of a tree, and they have hold of the arm of a corpse.  However, in the shadow of this human charnel house, at the edge of this bloody sewer, some little French soldiers come and go, eat and sleep for months at a time. The dreadfulness of the sights, the stench in the air, the tragic presence of death has not gripped their souls, their courage or their nerves. They are no less confident and merry than the others and, in the evening, when the setting sun adds the purple of its shadows to the red of all the blood that has been shed on the Butte, they sing from the depths of their charnel house sweet love songs.... This is the most regally beautiful sight I have seen in this war; it is the most splendidly moving example I know of what personal sacrifice for one's country's sake can do.  One day, in a rest village in the neighborhood, I met a soldier from one of the battalions which was encamped in the charnel house. He was a boy twenty years old, who hurried along with a flower in his buttonhole, whistling a tune.... He was so joyful that I asked him:  \"You seem as happy as you can be.\"  \"I have leave, Sir,\" he answered, \"and in a week I shall go to the country to see my mother. But, for the present, I have to go and take the trench at Eparges....\"  As he mentioned the name of the accursed Butte, I could not repress a movement. He saw it and said:  \"Sir, I am glad to go there.\"  And he told me his name and the number of his company. Then he hurried away.  It chanced that precisely one week later I met one of his officers. I asked him about the merry fellow.  \"That man? He was killed the day before yesterday at Eparges.\"  And my comrade added in a low voice:  \"He was shot down at my side, struck with a bullet square in the chest. The death agony set in at once. As I was trying to do something for him, passing my hand gently across his forehead, I said to him:  \"Courage, my boy, courage.\"  He murmured the reply:  \"Oh, I'm glad to die.\"  Glad ... the same phrase, the same words I had heard a week ago, which can be heard everywhere on the French front--and they are glad to go into all the trenches and into all the charnel houses, and it is with a happy heart that they rest in peace.         *       *       *       *       *  But France has not only fought with all her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18483"],["title","Fighting France (#7)"],["body",", with all her soul, with all her tenacity. She has fought with all her living strength, with her men, her women, even her children.  What can I say which has not already been said about the men? When I think of my own men, when I think of all the men floundering and fighting in this mud, I can find no other means of expression than the words that have already served the Commander in Chief of the French Army, General Pétain, on the evening of his great victory at the Chemin des Dames. In receiving the American newspapermen, he said to them:  \"Do not speak of us, the generals and the officers. Speak only of the men. We have done nothing; the men have done everything. Our men are wonderful; we, their leaders, can only kneel at their feet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The women have been no less wonderful. And I want to write a few words about them.  The women who are at the front have fought like the men. Can you imagine a more beautiful deed of arms than that of a young girl, twenty years old, named Marcelle Semer, whose heroic story a French Cabinet Minister, M. Klotz, told recently at one of the Matinées Nationales at the Sorbonne.  In August, 1914, there lived at Eclusier, near Frise, a young girl with gray eyes and blonde hair named Marcelle Semer. She was twenty years old at the time and kept accounts in addition to overseeing the work of a factory. At the time of the August invasion, after the Battle of Charleroi, the French tried to halt the Germans at the Somme. Not being in sufficient force, they retreated, crossing the river and the canal. The enemy immediately pursued. Marcelle Semer, who was following the French troops, had the presence of mind, after the last soldier had crossed the Somme Canal, to open the drawbridge in order to prevent the Germans from crossing it, and to hurl the key to the bridge into the canal in order that they might not take it from her when they came up. An entire enemy army corps was thus detained for twenty-four hours by this young girl's presence of mind; and it was only on the following day that the enemy, having found some boats on the Somme, made a bridge of them and passed over the canal. But the French soldiers were already far away.  The Germans were masters of the neighborhood for some days. They seized the inhabitants as hostages and shut them up in a cave. Marcelle Semer secretly carried them food. She also carried sustenance to other inhabitants who had hidden in the woods or in cellars. She succored and concealed the soldiers whom wounds or fatigue had prevented from following the main body of troops. She contrived that sixteen of them, dressed as civilians, escaped. Then she was apprehended by the Germans, arrested and led into the presence of a court-martial. The judgment was summary, and after a quarter of an hour's questioning Marcelle Semer was condemned to death.  \"Do you admit,\" asked the presiding officer, \"that you helped French soldiers to escape?\"  \"I certainly do,\" she replied. \"I managed it so that sixteen of them escaped, and they are beyond your reach. Now you can do what you want to me. I am an orphan. I have only one mother--France. She does not disturb me when I'm dying.\"  This was one time when God intervened. Marcelle did not die. Brought to the place of execution, at the very moment when they were about to shoot, the French reëntered the village and, by a miracle, she escaped her executioners. Today she wears the Croix de Guerre and the medal of the Legion of Honor.         *       *       *       *       *  They were Frenchwomen and fighters, these women whose names and deeds are to be found in the columns of the \"Journal Officiel.\" Read, for example, this citation concerning Madame Macherez, President of the Association des Dames Françaises de Soissons:       She willingly assumed the responsibility and the danger of      representing the city before the enemy, and defended or      managed the interests of the population in the absence of      the mayor and the majority of the members of the town      council. In spite of an intense bombardment which partially      ruined the city, she took the most effective means possible      to maintain calm in the city and to protect the lives of the      inhabitants.  In this department, a lay instructress, Mlle. Cheron, merited a citation which does not contain the least over-praise:       She evidenced the greatest energy in difficult      circumstances. Charged with the duties of Secretary to the      Mayor, and alone at the time of the arrival of the Germans,      she was not disconcerted by their threats, and kept her head      in the face of their demands with remarkable calm and      decision. When our troops returned, she assumed      responsibility for the service and feeding of the      cantonment. She personally took the steps necessary for the      identification and burial of the dead. Finally, she was able      to prevent panic at the time of the bombardment by the force      of her example and her encouragement of the populace.  Those three nuns were also Frenchwomen and fighters of whom the \"Journal Officiel\" in the general order spoke as follows:       Mlle. Rosnet, Marie, sister of the order of St. Vincent de      Paul, Mother Superior of the Hospice at Clermont-en-Argonne,      remained alone in the village and showed during the German      occupation an energy and coolness beyond all praise. Having      received a promise from the enemy that they would respect      the town in exchange for the care the sisters gave their      wounded, she protested to the German commander against the      burning of the town with the observation that \"the word of a      German officer is not worth that of a French officer.\" Thus      she obtained the help of a company of sappers who fought the      flames. She gave the most devoted care to the wounded,      German as well as French....       Mlle. Constance, Mother Superior of the Hospice at      Badonvillers, during the three successive German occupations      in 1914, assisted the sisters and remained bravely at her      post night and day, in spite of all danger, and was busy      everywhere with a devotion truly admirable....       Mlle. Brasseur, Sister Etienne, Mother Superior of the      Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul in the Hospital at Compiègne,      from the war's beginning at the head of a staff whose      tireless devotion has deserved all praise, has given the      most intelligent and enlightened care to numerous wounded      men. During the time of the German occupation, her coolness      and energetic attitude assured the safety of the      establishment she directed. Her brave initiative allowed      several French soldiers to escape from captivity.  The modest postmistress and telegraph operator was a Frenchwoman and a fighter, who, in the little village of Houpelines, in the north of the country, deserved this citation in the orders of the day, of which thousands of soldiers would be proud:       Refusing to obey the order that was given her to leave her      post, she remained in spite of the danger. On the first of      October the Germans entered her office, smashed her      apparatus and threatened her with death. Mlle. Deletete, who      had put her valuables and accounts in safe-keeping, gave      evidence of the greatest calmness. From the seventeenth on      she endured the bombardment. Her office having been damaged      severely by the enemy's fire, she took refuge in the civil      hospice, where four persons were killed at her side. She      resumed her duties on the twenty-third, since which date she      has continued to perform them in the face of frequent      bombardments which have found many victims.  The women behind the lines have been worthy of their sisters at the front.  In the forges, the foundries, the factories and the munition plants they have not feared to don the blouse of the workingman, and on this blouse they wear as insignia a large grenade like that on the brassard of the mobilized men. Note these figures. On the first of February, 1916, the civil establishments of war, the munition plants, and the Marine workshops employed 127,792 women. The number has increased, and on the first of March, 1917, they numbered 375,582 women. On the first of January, 1918, the women working in the factories manufacturing war material amounted to 475,000; that is to say, in round numbers, a half million.  Others, in the hospitals, ambulance and dispensaries have devoted themselves to the wounded, the mutilated, the sick and the suffering, to the sacrifice of their health, their youth, and sometimes their life itself. Here again the figures are eloquent--they speak for themselves. Three great societies, constituting the French Red Cross, have carried on this work of charity and devotion--the Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires, the Union des Dames de France, and The Association des Dames Françaises. At the war's outbreak the Société de Secours aux Blessés had 375 hospitals with 17,939 beds; today it has 796 hospitals with 67,000 beds and 15,510 graduated nurses, three thousand of whom are employed in military hospitals. On the thirty-first of December, 1916, the Union des Dames de France had 363 hospitals with 30,000 beds and more than 20,000 graduate or volunteer nurses. From August, 1914, to March, 1917, the Association des Dames Françaises had raised the number of its hospitals from 100 to 350, and from 5,000 to 18,000 the number of its beds; the number of its graduate nurses from 5,000 to 7,000.  On the thirty-first of December, 1916, the three societies counted about 42,000,000 days of hospital work, 25,000,000 for the Société de Secours aux Blessés alone. From the beginning of the war, this society has expended for equipment the sum of 38,700,000 francs.  Aside from these there are other figures which show the material effort of the Frenchwomen which I can not pass over in silence."]]]
