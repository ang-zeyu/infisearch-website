He answered it, and faced another question, and another. One by one, the doctors interrogated him, Black Doctor Arnquist among them. The questions came faster and faster; some were exceedingly difficult. Once or twice Dal was stopped cold, and forced to admit that he did not know the answer. Other questions which he knew would stop other students happened to fall in fields he understood better than most, and his answers were full and succinct.  But finally the questioning tapered off, and the White Doctor shuffled his papers impatiently. \"If there are no further medical questions, we can move on to another aspect of this student's application. Certain questions of policy have been raised. Black Doctor Tanner had some things to say, I believe, as co-ordinator of medical education.\"  The Black Doctor rose ponderously to his feet. \"I have some things to say, you can be sure of that,\" he said, \"but they have nothing to do with this Dal Timgar's educational qualifications for assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship.\" Black Doctor Tanner paused to glare in Dal's direction. \"He has been trained in a medical school on Hospital Earth, and apparently has passed his final qualifying examinations for the Red Service of Surgery. I can't argue about that.\"  Black Doctor Arnquist's voice came across the room. \"Then why are we having his review, Hugo? Dal Timgar's classmates all received their assignments automatically.\"  \"Because there are other things to consider here than educational qualifications,\" Hugo Tanner said. \"Gentlemen, consider our position for a moment. We have thousands of probationary physicians abroad in the galaxy at the present time, fine young men and women who have been trained in medical schools on Hospital Earth, and now are gaining experience and judgment while fulfilling our medical service contracts in every part of the confederation. They are probationers, but we must not forget that we physicians of Hospital Earth are also probationers. We are seeking a permanent place in this great Galactic Confederation, which was in existence many thousands of years before we even knew of its existence. It was not until our own scientists discovered the Koenig star-drive, enabling us to break free of our own solar system, that we were met face to face with a confederation of intelligent races inhabiting the galaxy--among others, the people from whom this same Dal Timgar has come.\"  \"The history is interesting,\" Black Doctor Arnquist broke in, \"but really, Hugo, I think most of us know it already.\"  \"Maybe we do,\" Doctor Tanner said, flushing a little. \"But the history is significant. Permanent membership in the confederation is contingent on two qualifications. First, we must have developed a star-drive of our own, a qualification of intelligence, if you will. The confederation has ruled that only races having a certain level of intelligence can become members. A star-drive could only be developed with a far-reaching understanding of the physical sciences, so this is a valid criterion of intelligence. But the second qualification for confederation membership is nothing more nor less than a question of usefulness.\"  The presiding White Doctor looked up, frowning. \"Usefulness?\"  \"Exactly. The Galactic Confederation, with its exchange of ideas and talents, and all the wealth of civilization it has to offer, is based on a division of labor. Every member must have something to contribute, some special talent. For Earthmen, the talent was obvious very early. Our technology was primitive, our manufacturing skills mediocre, our transport and communications systems impossible. But in our understanding of the life sciences, we have far outstripped any other race in the galaxy. We had already solved the major problems of disease and longevity among our own people, while some of the most advanced races in the confederation were being reduced to helplessness by cyclic plagues which slaughtered their populations, and were caused by nothing more complex than a simple parasitic virus. Garv II is an excellent example.\"  One of the Red Doctors cleared his throat. \"I'm afraid I don't quite see the connection. Nobody is arguing about our skill as doctors.\"  \"Of course not,\" Black Doctor Tanner said. \"The point is that in all the galaxy, Earthmen are by their very nature the _best_ doctors, outstripping the most advanced physicians on any other planet. And this, gentlemen, is our bargaining point. We are useful to the Galactic Confederation only as physicians. The confederation needed us badly enough to admit us to probational membership, but if we ever hope to become full members of the confederation, we must demonstrate our usefulness, our unique skill, as physicians. We have worked hard to prove ourselves. We have made Hospital Earth the galactic center of study and treatment of diseases of many races. Earthmen on the General Practice Patrol ships visit planets in the remotest sections, and their reputation as physicians has grown. Every year new planets are writing full medical service contracts with us ... as Earthmen serving the galaxy--\"  \"As _physicians_ serving the galaxy,\" Black Doctor Arnquist's voice shot across the room.  \"As far as the confederation has been concerned, the two have been synonymous,\" Hugo Tanner roared. \"_Until now._ But now we have an alien among us. We have allowed a non-Earthman to train in our medical schools. He has completed the required work, his qualifications are acceptable, and now he proposes to go out on a patrol ship as a physician of the Red Service of Surgery. But think of what you are doing if you permit him to go! You will be proving to every planet in the confederation that they don't really need Earthmen after all, that any race from any planet might produce physicians just as capable as Earthmen.\"  The Black Doctor turned slowly to face Dal, his mouth set in a grim line. As he talked, his face had grown dark with anger. \"Understand that I have nothing against this creature as an individual. Perhaps he would prove to be a competent physician, although I cannot believe it. Perhaps he would carry on the traditions of medical service we have worked so long to establish, although I doubt it. But I do know that if we permit him to become a qualified physician, it will be the beginning of the end for Hospital Earth. We will be selling out our sole bargaining position. We can forget our hopes for membership in the confederation, because one like him this year will mean two next year, and ten the next, and there will be no end to it. We should have stopped it eight years ago, but certain ones prevailed to admit Dal Timgar to training. If we do not stop it now, for all time, we will never be able to stop it.\"  Slowly the Black Doctor sat down, motioning to an orderly at the rear of the room. The orderly brought a glass of water and a small capsule which Black Doctor Tanner gulped down. The other doctors were talking heatedly among themselves as Black Doctor Arnquist rose to his feet. \"Then you are claiming that our highest calling is to keep medicine in the hands of Earthmen alone?\" he asked softly.  Doctor Tanner flushed. \"Our highest calling is to provide good medical care for our patients,\" he said.  \"The best possible medical care?\"  \"I never said otherwise.\"  \"And yet you deny the ancient tradition that a physician's duty is to help his patients help themselves,\" Black Doctor Arnquist said.  \"I said no such thing!\" Hugo Tanner cried, jumping to his feet. \"But we must protect ourselves. We have no other power, nothing else to sell.\"  \"And I say that if we must sell our medical skill for our own benefit first, then we are not worthy to be physicians to anyone,\" Doctor Arnquist snapped. \"You make a very convincing case, but if we examine it closely, we see that it amounts to nothing but fear and selfishness.\"  \"Fear?\" Doctor Tanner cried. \"What do we have to fear if we can maintain our position? But if we must yield to a Garvian who has no business in medicine in the first place, what can we have left but fear?\"  \"If I were really convinced that Earthmen were the best physicians in the galaxy,\" Black Doctor Arnquist replied, \"I don't think I'd have to be afraid.\"  The Black Doctor at the end of the table stood up, shaking with rage. \"Listen to him!\" he cried to the others. \"Once again he is defending this creature and turning his back on common sense. All I ask is that we keep our skills among our own people and avoid the contamination that will surely result--\"  Doctor Tanner broke off, his face suddenly white. He coughed, clutching at his chest, and sank down groping for his medicine box and the water glass. After a moment he caught his breath and shook his head. \"There's nothing more I can say,\" he said weakly. \"I have done what I could, and the decision is up to the rest of you.\" He coughed again, and slowly the color came back into his face. The Blue Doctor had risen to help him, but Tanner waved him aside. \"No, no, it's nothing. I allowed myself to become angry.\"  Black Doctor Arnquist spread his hands. \"Under the circumstances, I won't belabor the point,\" he said, \"although I think it would be good if Doctor Tanner would pause in his activities long enough for the surgery that would make his anger less dangerous to his own life. But he represents a view, and his right to state it is beyond reproach.\" Doctor Arnquist looked from face to face along the council table. \"The decision is yours, gentlemen, I would ask only that you consider what our highest calling as physicians really is--a duty that overrides fear and selfishness. I believe Dal Timgar would be a good physician, and that this is more important than the planet of his origin. I think he would uphold the honor of Hospital Earth wherever he went, and give us his loyalty as well as his service. I will vote to accept his application, and thus"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18492"],["title","Star Surgeon (#5)"],["body","out my colleague's negative vote. The deciding votes will be cast by the rest of you.\"  He sat down, and the White Doctor looked at Dal Timgar. \"It would be good if you would wait outside,\" he said. \"We will call you as soon as a decision is reached.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dal waited in an anteroom, feeding Fuzzy and trying to put out of his mind for a moment the heated argument still raging in the council chamber. Fuzzy was quivering with fright; unable to speak, the tiny creature nevertheless clearly experienced emotions, even though Dal himself did not know how he received impressions, nor why.  But Dal knew that there was a connection between the tiny pink creature's emotions and the peculiar talent that Black Doctor Arnquist had spoken of the night before. It was not a telepathic power that Dal and his people possessed. Just _what_ it was, was difficult to define, yet Dal knew that every Garvian depended upon it to some extent in dealing with people around him. He knew that when Fuzzy was sitting on his arm he could sense the emotions of those around him--the anger, the fear, the happiness, the suspicion--and he knew that under certain circumstances, in a way he did not clearly understand, he could wilfully change the feelings of others toward himself. Not a great deal, perhaps, nor in any specific way, but just enough to make them look upon him and his wishes more favorably than they otherwise might.  Throughout his years on Hospital Earth he had vigilantly avoided using this strange talent. Already he was different enough from Earthmen in appearance, in ways of thinking, in likes and dislikes. But these differences were not advantages, and he had realized that if his classmates had ever dreamed of the advantage that he had, minor as it was, his hopes of becoming a physician would have been destroyed completely.  And in the council room he had kept his word to Doctor Arnquist. He had felt Fuzzy quivering on his shoulder; he had sensed the bitter anger in Black Doctor Tanner's mind, and the temptation deliberately to mellow that anger had been almost overwhelming, but he had turned it aside. He had answered questions that were asked him, and listened to the debate with a growing sense of hopelessness.  And now the chance was gone. The decision was being made.  He paced the floor, trying to remember the expressions of the other doctors, trying to remember what had been said, how many had seemed friendly and how many hostile, but he knew that only intensified the torture. There was nothing he could do now but wait.  At last the door opened, and an orderly nodded to him. Dal felt his legs tremble as he walked into the room and faced the semi-circle of doctors. He tried to read the answer on their faces, but even Black Doctor Arnquist sat impassively, doodling on the pad before him, refusing to meet Dal's eyes.  The White Doctor took up a sheet of paper. \"We have considered your application, and have reached a decision. You will be happy to know that your application for assignment has been tentatively accepted.\"  Dal heard the words, and it seemed as though the room were spinning around him. He wanted to shout for joy and throw his arms around Black Doctor Arnquist, but he stood perfectly still, and suddenly he noticed that Fuzzy was very quiet on his shoulder.  \"You will understand that this acceptance is not irrevocable,\" the White Doctor went on. \"We are not willing to guarantee your ultimate acceptance as a fully qualified Star Surgeon at this point. You will be allowed to wear a collar and cuff, uniform and insignia of a probationary physician, in the Red Service, and will be assigned aboard the General Practice Patrol ship _Lancet_, leaving from Hospital Seattle next Tuesday. If you prove your ability in that post, your performance will once again be reviewed by this board, but you alone will determine our decision then. Your final acceptance as a Star Surgeon will depend entirely upon your conduct as a member of the patrol ship's crew.\" He smiled at Dal, and set the paper down. \"The council wishes you well. Do you have any questions?\"  \"Just one,\" Dal managed to say. \"Who will my crewmates be?\"  \"As is customary, a probationer from the Green Service of Medicine and one from the Blue Service of Diagnosis. Both have been specially selected by this council. Your Blue Doctor will be Jack Alvarez, who has shown great promise in his training in diagnostic medicine.\"  \"And the Green Doctor?\"  \"A young man named Frank Martin,\" the White Doctor said. \"Known to his friends, I believe, as 'Tiger.'\"     CHAPTER 4  THE GALACTIC PILL PEDDLERS   The ship stood tall and straight on her launching pad, with the afternoon sunlight glinting on her hull. Half a dozen crews of check-out men were swarming about her, inspecting her engine and fuel supplies, riding up the gantry crane to her entrance lock, and guiding the great cargo nets from the loading crane into her afterhold. High up on her hull Dal Timgar could see a golden caduceus emblazoned, the symbol of the General Practice Patrol, and beneath it the ship's official name:        GPPS 238       _LANCET_  Dal shifted his day pack down from his shoulders, ridiculously pleased with the gleaming scarlet braid on the collar and cuff of his uniform, and lifted Fuzzy up on his shoulder to see. It seemed to Dal that everyone he had passed in the terminal had been looking at the colorful insignia; it was all he could do to keep from holding his arm up and waving it like a banner.  \"You'll get used to it,\" Tiger Martin chuckled as they waited for the jitney to take them across to the launching pad. \"At first you think everybody is impressed by the colors, until you see some guy go past with the braid all faded and frazzled at the edges, and then you realize that you're just the latest greenhorn in a squad of two hundred thousand men.\"  \"It's still good to be wearing it,\" Dal said. \"I couldn't really believe it until Black Doctor Arnquist turned the collar and cuff over to me.\" He looked suspiciously at Tiger. \"You must have known a lot more about that interview than you let on. Or, was it just coincidence that we were assigned together?\"  \"Not coincidence, exactly.\" Tiger grinned. \"I didn't know what was going to happen. I'd requested assignment with you on my application, and then when yours was held up, Doctor Arnquist asked me if I'd be willing to wait for assignment until the interview was over. So I said okay. He seemed to think you had a pretty good chance.\"  \"I'd never have made it without his backing,\" Dal said.  \"Well, anyway, he figured that if you _were_ assigned, it would be a good idea to have a friend on the patrol ship team.\"  \"I won't argue about _that_,\" Dal said. \"But who is the Blue Service man?\"  Tiger's face darkened. \"I don't know much about him,\" he said. \"He trained in California, and I met him just once, at a diagnosis and therapy conference. He's supposed to be plenty smart, according to the grapevine. I guess he'd have to be, to pass Diagnostic Service finals.\" Tiger chuckled. \"Any dope can make it in the Medical or Surgical Services, but diagnosis is something else again.\"  \"Will he be in command?\"  \"On the _Lancet_? Why should he? We'll share command, just like any patrol ship crew. If we run into problems we can't agree on, we holler for help. But if he acts like most of the Blue Doctors I know, he'll _think_ he's in command.\"  A jitney stopped for them, and then zoomed out across the field toward the ship. The gantry platform was just clanging to the ground, unloading three technicians and a Four-bar Electronics Engineer. Tiger and Dal rode the platform up again and moments later stepped through the entrance lock of the ship that would be their home base for months and perhaps years.  They found the bunk room to the rear of the control and lab sections. A duffel bag was already lodged on one of the bunks; one of the foot lockers was already occupied, and a small but expensive camera and a huge pair of field glasses were hanging from one of the wall brackets.  \"Looks like our man has already arrived,\" Tiger said, tossing down his own duffel bag and looking around the cramped quarters. \"Not exactly a luxury suite, I'd say. Wonder where he is?\"  \"Let's look up forward,\" Dal said. \"We've plenty to do before we take off. Maybe he's just getting an early start.\"  They explored the ship, working their way up the central corridor past the communications and computer rooms and the laboratory into the main control and observation room. Here they found a thin, dark-haired young man in a bright blue collar and cuff, sitting engrossed with a tape-reader.  For a moment they thought he hadn't heard them. Then, as though reluctant to tear himself away, the Blue Doctor sighed, snapped off the reader, and turned on the swivel stool.  \"So!\" he said. \"I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to get here.\"  \"We ran into some delays,\" Tiger said. He grinned and held out his hand. \"Jack Alvarez? Tiger Martin. We met each other at that conference in Chicago last year.\"  \"Yes, I remember,\" the Blue Doctor said. \"You found some holes in a paper I gave. Matter of fact, I've plugged them up very nicely since then. You'd have trouble finding fault with the work now.\" Jack Alvarez turned his eyes to Dal. \"And I suppose this is the Garvian I've been hearing about, complete with his little pink stooge.\"  The moment they had walked in the door, Dal had felt Fuzzy crouch down tight against his shoulder. Now a wave of hostility struck his mind like a shower of ice water. He had never seen this thin, dark-haired youth before, or even heard of him, but he recognized this sharp impression of hatred and anger unmistakably. He had felt it a thousand times among his medical school classmates during the past eight years, and just hours before he had felt it in the council room when Black Doctor Tanner had turned on him.  \"It's really a lucky break that"]]]
