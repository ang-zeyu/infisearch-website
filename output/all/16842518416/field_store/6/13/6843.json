He was ‘magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged with ermine.  Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced with the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls and precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants.  About his neck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;’ and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.  O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar with rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!     CHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.  We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels.  There was but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he was hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil.  The Prince continued to struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was suffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him, and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince’s head.  The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man’s arm, and the blow descended upon his own wrist.  Canty roared out--  “Thou’lt meddle, wilt thou?  Then have thy reward.”  His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler’s head:  there was a groan, a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone.  The mob pressed on, their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.  Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty’s abode, with the door closed against the outsiders.  By the vague light of a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the loathsome den, and also the occupants of it.  Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading it now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes.  John Canty said to this one--  “Tarry!  There’s fine mummeries here.  Mar them not till thou’st enjoyed them:  then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt.  Stand forth, lad.  Now say thy foolery again, an thou’st not forgot it. Name thy name.  Who art thou?”  The insulted blood mounted to the little prince’s cheek once more, and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man’s face and said--  “‘Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak.  I tell thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none other.”  The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag’s feet to the floor where she stood, and almost took her breath.  She stared at the Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst into a roar of laughter.  But the effect upon Tom Canty’s mother and sisters was different.  Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort.  They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces, exclaiming--  “Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!”  The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears. Then she said--  “Oh, my poor boy!  Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at last, and ta’en thy wit away.  Ah! why did’st thou cleave to it when I so warned thee ‘gainst it?  Thou’st broke thy mother’s heart.”  The Prince looked into her face, and said gently--  “Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame.  Comfort thee: let me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my father restore him to thee.”  “The King thy father!  Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee.  Shake of this gruesome dream.  Call back thy poor wandering memory.  Look upon me. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?”  The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--  “God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never looked upon thy face before.”  The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.  “Let the show go on!” shouted Canty.  “What, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless wenches! will ye stand in the Prince’s presence?  Upon your knees, ye pauper scum, and do him reverence!”  He followed this with another horse-laugh.  The girls began to plead timidly for their brother; and Nan said--  “An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his madness:  prithee, do.”  “Do, father,” said Bet; “he is more worn than is his wont.  To-morrow will he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not empty home again.”  This remark sobered the father’s joviality, and brought his mind to business.  He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--  “The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two pennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year’s rent, else out of this we go.  Show what thou’st gathered with thy lazy begging.”  The Prince said--  “Offend me not with thy sordid matters.  I tell thee again I am the King’s son.”  A sounding blow upon the Prince’s shoulder from Canty’s broad palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty’s arms, who clasped him to her breast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing her own person.  The frightened girls retreated to their corner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.  The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--  “Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam.  Let these swine do their will upon me alone.”  This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about their work without waste of time.  Between them they belaboured the boy right soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim.  “Now,” said Canty, “to bed, all of ye.  The entertainment has tired me.”  The light was put out, and the family retired.  As soon as the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep, the young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also, and stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his ear the while.  She had saved a morsel for him to eat, also; but the boy’s pains had swept away all appetite--at least for black and tasteless crusts.  He was touched by her brave and costly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in very noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try to forget her sorrows.  And he added that the King his father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded.  This return to his ‘madness’ broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again and again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.  As she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane.  She could not describe it, she could not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it.  What if the boy were really not her son, after all?  Oh, absurd!  She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her griefs and troubles.  No matter, she found that it was an idea that would not ‘down,’ but persisted in haunting her.  It pursued her, it harassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.  At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without question, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts.  Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test.  But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish.  She turned over in her mind one promising test after another, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were absolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her.  Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up.  While this depressing thought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep.  And while she listened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream.  This chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined.  She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work to relight her candle, muttering to herself, “Had I but seen him _then_, I should have known!  Since that day, when he was little, that the powder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his eyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the palm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18378"],["title","Catholic Problems in Western Canada (#0)"],["body","Problems  in  Western Canada    By  George Thomas Daly, C.SS.R.     _With preface by the Most Reverend O.

PREFACE  _Letter of the Most Reverend O. E. Mathieu,   Archbishop of Regina, to the Author_  REVEREND G. DALY, C.SS.R.,   St. John, N.B.  Dear Father,--  Quebec Province claims you as her son.  There you lived for many years; there you learned to admire the peaceful life and to appreciate the genuine happiness of our patriarchal families; there you were an eyewitness of the \"bonne entente\" and noble rivalry which exist between the ethnical groups that go to make up its population.  At various times your sacred ministry has brought you in touch with the other Eastern Provinces of our broad Dominion.  A keen observer, you readily grasped existing conditions and the mentality of the various elements of our Canadian Population.  The year 1917 found you laboring in our beloved Province of Saskatchewan, as Rector of our Cathedral.  For three years you lived with us.  The possibilities of our great West soon appealed to your enthusiastic heart.  The various problems which here engage the attention of the Church fired your soul with noble ambition.  I shall never forget the good you have done in the parish committed to your care.  I shall be ever grateful for the zeal with which you devoted yourself, heart and soul, to the guidance of those under your charge. You found your happiness in making others happy, remembering that kindly actions alone give to our days their real value.  Your priestly heart understood that when one is in God's service he must not be content with doing things in a half-hearted way or without willing sacrifice.  But the voice of your Superiors called you to another field of action, and with ready obedience you hastened to the Eastern extremity of the Dominion.  I can assure you, dear Father, that, though absent, your memory is still fresh among us.  Your old parishioners of Holy Rosary Cathedral, and others with whom you came in contact through missions and other work throughout the Province, have kept a fond and faithful remembrance of your Reverence.  The citizens of Regina who are not of our Faith still remember the noble efforts you always put forth to promote good will and concord in the community at large.  Your charity proved to them that we were not born to hate but to love one another. It affords me great pleasure to see that since you left the West you have continued to have its welfare at heart, its problems ever present in your thought.  For you tell me that you are just about to publish a book on \"Catholic problems in Western Canada.\"  The West, you have known, studied and loved.  The tremendous obstacles, as well as the great possibilities which there face the Church at this critical hour of our history, have left on your mind a lasting impression.  You fully realize, dear Father, that our Western problems are not sufficiently known by the Catholics of the East.  Were the importance of these issues fully appreciated by all, a greater interest would be taken in regard to their immediate solution.  Catholics throughout the Country, you rightly state, are obliged to further the influence of Holy Mother Church in our Western Provinces, which will certainly be called upon within a very near future to play a most important part in our Dominion.  To draw the attention of Catholics to the critical issues which conditions, during the last decade or so, have created in our great West, and to offer solutions which will be beneficial to the Church, are the noble motives that have prompted your important work and guided you on to its completion.  Even though some may not fully share your views, or see eye to eye with you on the means of action you suggest, you will have nevertheless attained your object.  You will have, I am confident, awakened interest in our Western problems which, I repeat, are unfortunately not known, or at least, are not fully appreciated by too many of our own.  There is a saying that the heart has reasons which the mind does not fully grasp.  I feel sure that the many hours you have spent in the composition of your book, coupled with the strenuous work of the missions, to which you have consecrated yourself with unrelenting zeal since your departure from our midst, have been calculated to weaken your health.  But your heart, unmindful of self, did not consider time and fatigue so long as your fellow-man was being benefited.  Your love for God and His Church induced you to undertake this work and carry it through to completion.  Your book, I am sure, is destined to produce happy results.  This will be your consolation and your reward.  Asking God to bless your work and wishing you to accept this expression of my constant gratitude and sincere friendship, I remain as ever,  Devotedly yours,  OLIVIER ELZEAR MATHIEU,  _Archbishop of Regina._   ARCHBISHOP'S HOUSE,  REGINA, November 21st, 1920.     INTRODUCTION  Praesentia tangens. . . . .   Futura prospiciens.  Problems characterize every age, sum up the complex life of nations and give them their distinctive features.  They form that moral atmosphere which makes one period of history responsible and tributary to another. And indeed, in every human problem there is an ethical element.  This imponderable factor, which often baffles our calculations, always remains the true, permanent driving force.  For in the last analysis of human things, morality is what reachest furthest and matters most.  Problems may vary with the times and the countries, and yet, the moral issues involved never change; for, right is eternal.  To detect this ethical element amid the ever restless waves of human activities has ever been the noble and constant effort of true leaders.  Like the pilot they are ever watching for the lighted buoy on the tossing waves.  This moral element underlying all our national problems is what affects Catholics as such, or rather the medium through which Catholics are called to affect them.  No period should prove more interesting to Catholics than our own, for the very principles of Christian Ethics are now being questioned and vindicated in the lives of nations, either by the benefits accruing from their application, or by the evils consequent upon their neglect.  Our neo-pagan world is learning by a cruel and sad experience that Religion is the foundation of morality, and morality that of true legality.  \"For unless"]]]
