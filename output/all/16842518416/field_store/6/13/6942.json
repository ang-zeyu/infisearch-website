Just a minute.\"  Moments later he had handed Dal the yellow telephone message sheet, and Dal was studying the words with a puzzled frown:        CALL AT MY QUARTERS ON ARRIVAL REGARDLESS OF HOUR STOP       URGENT THAT I SEE YOU STOP REPEAT URGENT  The message was signed THORVOLD ARNQUIST, BLACK SERVICE and carried the priority seal of the Four-star Pathologist. Dal read it again, shifted his pack, and started once more for the subway ramp. He thrust the message into his pocket, and his step quickened as he heard the whistle of the pressure-tube trains up ahead.  Black Doctor Arnquist, the man who had first defended his right to study medicine on Hospital Earth, now wanted to see him before the council meeting took place.  For the first time in days, Dal Timgar felt a new flicker of hope.     CHAPTER 2  HOSPITAL SEATTLE   It was a long way from the students' barracks to the pathology sector where Black Doctor Arnquist lived. Dal Timgar decided not to try to go to the barracks first. It was after midnight, and even though the message had said \"regardless of hour,\" Dal shrank from the thought of awakening a physician of the Black Service at two o'clock in the morning. He was already later arriving at Hospital Seattle than he had expected to be, and quite possibly Black Doctor Arnquist would be retiring. It seemed better to go there without delay.  But one thing took priority. He found a quiet spot in the waiting room near the subway entrance and dug into his day pack for the pressed biscuit and the canister of water he had there. He broke off a piece of the biscuit and held it up for Fuzzy to see.  Fuzzy wriggled down onto his hand, and a tiny mouth appeared just below the shoe-button eyes. Bit by bit Dal fed his friend the biscuit, with squirts of water in between bites. Finally, when the biscuit was gone, Dal squirted the rest of the water into Fuzzy's mouth and rubbed him between the eyes. \"Feel better now?\" he asked.  The creature seemed to understand; he wriggled in Dal's hand and blinked his eyes sleepily. \"All right, then,\" Dal said. \"Off to sleep.\"  Dal started to tuck him back into his jacket pocket, but Fuzzy abruptly sprouted a pair of forelegs and began struggling fiercely to get out again. Dal grinned and replaced the little creature in the crook of his arm. \"Don't like that idea so well, eh? Okay, friend. If you want to watch, that suits me.\"  He found a map of the city at the subway entrance, and studied it carefully. Like other hospital cities on Earth, Seattle was primarily a center for patient care and treatment rather than a supply or administrative center. Here in Seattle special facilities existed for the care of the intelligent marine races that required specialized hospital care. The depths of Puget Sound served as a vast aquatic ward system where creatures which normally lived in salt-water oceans on their native planets could be cared for, and the specialty physicians who worked with marine races had facilities here for research and teaching in their specialty. The dry-land sectors of the hospital were organized to support the aquatic wards; the surgeries, the laboratories, the pharmacies and living quarters all were arranged on the periphery of the salt-water basin, and rapid-transit tubes carried medical workers, orderlies, nurses and physicians to the widespread areas of the hospital city.  The pathology sector lay to the north of the city, and Black Doctor Arnquist was the chief pathologist of Hospital Seattle. Dal found a northbound express tube, climbed into an empty capsule, and pressed the buttons for the pathology sector. Presently the capsule was shifted automatically into the pressure tube that would carry him thirty miles north to his destination.  It was the first time Dal had ever visited a Black Doctor in his quarters, and the idea made him a little nervous. Of all the medical services on Hospital Earth, none had the power of the Black Service of Pathology. Traditionally in Earth medicine, the pathologists had always occupied a position of power and discipline. The autopsy rooms had always been the \"Temples of Truth\" where the final, inarguable answers in medicine were ultimately found, and for centuries pathologists had been the judges and inspectors of the profession of medicine.  And when Earth had become Hospital Earth, with status as a probationary member of the Galactic Confederation of Worlds, it was natural that the Black Service of Pathology had become the governors and policy-makers, regimenting every aspect of the medical services provided by Earth physicians.  Dal knew that the medical training council, which would be reviewing his application in just a few hours, was made up of physicians from all the services--the Green Service of Medicine, the Blue Service of Diagnosis, the Red Service of Surgery, as well as the Auxiliary Services--but the Black Doctors who sat on the council would have the final say, the final veto power.  He wondered now why Black Doctor Arnquist wanted to see him. At first he had thought there might be special news for him, word perhaps that his assignment had come through after all, that the interview tomorrow would not be held. But on reflection, he realized that didn't make sense. If that were the case, Doctor Arnquist would have said so, and directed him to report to a ship. More likely, he thought, the Black Doctor wanted to see him only to soften the blow, to help him face the decision that seemed inevitable.  He left the pneumatic tube and climbed on the jitney that wound its way through the corridors of the pathology sector and into the quiet, austere quarters of the resident pathologists. He found the proper concourse, and moments later he was pressing his thumb against the identification plate outside the Black Doctor's personal quarters.         *       *       *       *       *  Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist looked older now than when Dal had last seen him. His silvery gray hair was thinning, and there were tired lines around his eyes and mouth that Dal did not remember from before. The old man's body seemed more wispy and frail than ever, and the black cloak across his shoulders rustled as he led Dal back into a book-lined study.  The Black Doctor had not yet gone to bed. On a desk in the corner of the study several books lay open, and a roll of paper was inserted in the dicto-typer. \"I knew you would get the message when you arrived,\" he said as he took Dal's pack, \"and I thought you might be later than you planned. A good trip, I trust. And your friend here? He enjoys shuttle travel?\" He smiled and stroked Fuzzy with a gnarled finger. \"I suppose you wonder why I wanted to see you.\"  Dal Timgar nodded slowly. \"About the interview tomorrow?\"  \"Ah, yes. The interview.\" The Black Doctor made a sour face and shook his head. \"A bad business for you, that interview. How do you feel about it?\"  Dal spread his hands helplessly. As always, the Black Doctor's questions cut through the trimming to the heart of things. They were always difficult questions to answer.  \"I ... I suppose it's something that's necessary,\" he said finally.  \"Oh?\" the Black Doctor frowned. \"But why necessary for you if not for the others? How many were there in your class, including all the services? Three hundred? And out of the three hundred only one was refused assignment.\" He looked up sharply at Dal, his pale blue eyes very alert in his aged face. \"Right?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And you really feel it's just normal procedure that your application is being challenged?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"How _do_ you feel about it, Dal? Angry, maybe?\"  Dal squirmed. \"Yes, sir. You might say that.\"  \"Perhaps even bitter,\" the Black Doctor said.  \"I did as good work as anyone else in my class,\" Dal said hotly. \"I did my part as well as anyone could, I didn't let up once all the way through. Bitter! Wouldn't you feel bitter?\"  The Black Doctor nodded slowly. \"Yes, I imagine I would,\" he said, sinking down into the chair behind the desk with a sigh. \"As a matter of fact, I do feel a little bitter about it, even though I was afraid that it might come to this in the end. I can't blame you for your feelings.\" He took a deep breath. \"I wish I could promise you that everything would be all right tomorrow, but I'm afraid I can't. The council has a right to review your qualifications, and it holds the power to assign you to a patrol ship on the spot, if it sees fit. Conceivably, a Black Doctor might force the council's approval, if he were the only representative of the Black service there. But I will not be the only Black Doctor sitting on the council tomorrow.\"  \"I know that,\" Dal said.  Doctor Arnquist looked up at Dal for a long moment. \"Why do you want to be a doctor in the first place, Dal? This isn't the calling of your people. You must be the one Garvian out of millions with the patience and peculiar mental make-up to permit you to master the scientific disciplines involved in studying medicine. Either you are different from the rest of your people--which I doubt--or else you are driven to force yourself into a pattern foreign to your nature for very compelling reasons. What are they? Why do you want medicine?\"  It was the hardest question of all, the question Dal had dreaded. He knew the answer, just as he had known for most of his life that he wanted to be a doctor above all else. But he had never found a way to put the reasons into words. \"I can't say,\" he said slowly. \"I _know_, but I can't express it, and whenever I try, it just sounds silly.\"  \"Maybe your reasons don't make reasonable sense,\" the old man said gently.  \"But they do! At least to me, they do,\" Dal said. \"I've always wanted to be a doctor. There's nothing else I want to do. To work at home, among my people.\"  \"There was a plague on Garv II, wasn't there?\" Doctor Arnquist said. \"A cyclic thing that came back again and again. The cycle was broken just a few years ago, when the virus that caused it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18492"],["title","Star Surgeon (#3)"],["body","finally isolated and destroyed.\"  \"By the physicians of Hospital Earth,\" Dal said.  \"It's happened again and again,\" the Black Doctor said. \"We've seen the same pattern repeated a thousand times across the galaxy, and it has always puzzled us, just a little.\" He smiled. \"You see, our knowledge and understanding of the life sciences here on Earth have always grown hand in hand with the physical sciences. We had always assumed that the same thing would happen on _any_ planet where a race has developed intelligence and scientific methods of study. We were wrong, of course, which is the reason for the existence of Hospital Earth and her physicians today, but it still amazes us that with all the technology and civilization in the galaxy, we Earthmen are the only people yet discovered who have developed a broad knowledge of the processes of life and illness and death.\"  The old man looked up at his visitor, and Dal felt his pale blue eyes searching his face. \"How badly do you want to be a doctor, Dal?\"  \"More than anything else I know,\" Dal said.  \"Badly enough to do anything to achieve your goal?\"  Dal hesitated, and stroked Fuzzy's head gently. \"Well ... almost anything.\"  The Black Doctor nodded. \"And that, of course, is the reason I had to see you before this interview, my friend. I know you've played the game straight right from the beginning, up to this point. Now I beg of you not to do the thing that you are thinking of doing.\"  For a moment Dal just stared at the little old man in black, and felt the fur on his arms and back rise up. A wave of panic flooded his mind. _He knows!_ he thought frantically. _He must be able to read minds!_ But he thrust the idea away. There was no way that the Black Doctor could know. No race of creatures in the galaxy had _that_ power. And yet there was no doubt that Black Doctor Arnquist knew what Dal had been thinking, just as surely as if he had said it aloud.  Dal shook his head helplessly. \"I ... I don't know what you mean.\"  \"I think you do,\" Doctor Arnquist said. \"Please, Dal. Trust me. This is not the time to lie. The thing that you were planning to do at the interview would be disastrous, even if it won you an assignment. It would be dishonest and unworthy.\"  _Then he does know!_ Dal thought. _But how? I couldn't have told him, or given him any hint._ He felt Fuzzy give a frightened shiver on his arm, and then words were tumbling out of his mouth. \"I don't know what you're talking about, there wasn't anything I was thinking of. I mean, what could I do? If the council wants to assign me to a ship, they will, and if they don't, they won't. I don't know what you're thinking of.\"  \"Please.\" Black Doctor Arnquist held up his hand. \"Naturally you defend yourself,\" he said. \"I can't blame you for that, and I suppose this is an unforgivable breach of diplomacy even to mention it to you, but I think it must be done. Remember that we have been studying and observing your people very carefully over the past two hundred years, Dal. It is no accident that you have such a warm attachment to your little pink friend here, and it is no accident that wherever a Garvian is found, his Fuzzy is with him, isn't that so? And it is no accident that your people are such excellent tradesmen, that you are so remarkably skillful in driving bargains favorable to yourselves ... that you are in fact the most powerful single race of creatures in the whole Galactic Confederation.\"  The old man walked to the bookshelves behind him and brought down a thick, bound manuscript. He handed it across the desk as Dal watched him. \"You may read this if you like, at your leisure. Don't worry, it's not for publication, just a private study which I have never mentioned before to anyone, but the pattern is unmistakable. This peculiar talent of your people is difficult to describe: not really telepathy, but an ability to create the emotional responses in others that will be most favorable to you. Just what part your Fuzzies play in this ability of your people I am not sure, but I'm quite certain that without them you would not have it.\"  He smiled at Dal's stricken face. \"A forbidden topic, eh? And yet perfectly true. You know right now that if you wanted to you could virtually paralyze me with fright, render me helpless to do anything but stand here and shiver, couldn't you? Or if I were hostile to your wishes, you could suddenly force me to sympathize with you and like you enormously, until I was ready to agree to anything you wanted--\"  \"No,\" Dal broke in. \"Please, you don't understand! I've never done it, not once since I came to Hospital Earth.\"  \"I know that. I've been watching you.\"  \"And I wouldn't think of doing it.\"  \"Not even at the council interview?\"  \"Never!\"  \"Then let me have Fuzzy now. He is the key to this special talent of your people. Give him to me now, and go to the interview without him.\"  Dal drew back, trembling, trying to fight down panic. He brought his hand around to the soft fur of the little pink fuzz-ball. \"I ... can't do that,\" he said weakly.  \"Not even if it meant your assignment to a patrol ship?\"  Dal hesitated, then shook his head. \"Not even then. But I won't do what you're saying, I promise you.\"  For a long moment Black Doctor Arnquist stared at him. Then he smiled. \"Will you give me your word?  \"Yes, I promise.\"  \"Then I wish you good luck. I will do what I can at the interview. But now there is a bed for you here. You will need sleep if you are to present your best appearance.\"     CHAPTER 3  THE INQUISITION   The interview was held in the main council chambers of Hospital Seattle, and Dal could feel the tension the moment he stepped into the room. He looked at the long semicircular table, and studied the impassive faces of the four-star Physicians across the table from him.  Each of the major medical services was represented this morning. In the center, presiding over the council, was a physician of the White Service, a Four-star Radiologist whose insignia gleamed on his shoulders. There were two physicians each, representing the Red Service of Surgery, the Green Service of Medicine, the Blue Service of Diagnosis, and finally, seated at either end of the table, the representatives of the Black Service of Pathology. Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist sat to Dal's left; he smiled faintly as the young Garvian stepped forward, then busied himself among the papers on the desk before him. To Dal's right sat another Black Doctor who was not smiling.  Dal had seen him before--the chief co-ordinator of medical education on Hospital Earth, the \"Black Plague\" of the medical school jokes. Black Doctor Hugo Tanner was large and florid of face, blinking owlishly at Dal over his heavy horn-rimmed glasses. The glasses were purely decorative; with modern eye-cultures and transplant techniques, no Earthman had really needed glasses to correct his vision for the past two hundred years, but on Hugo Tanner's angry face they added a look of gravity and solemnity that the Black Doctor could not achieve without them. Still glaring at Dal, Doctor Tanner leaned over to speak to the Blue Doctor on his right, and they nodded and laughed unpleasantly at some private joke.  There was no place for him to sit, so Dal stood before the table, as straight as his five-foot height would allow him. He had placed Fuzzy almost defiantly on his shoulder, and from time to time he could feel the little creature quiver and huddle against his neck as though to hide from sight under his collar.  The White Doctor opened the proceedings, and at first the questions were entirely medical. \"We are meeting to consider this student's application for assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship, as a probationary physician in the Red Service of Surgery. I believe you are all acquainted with his educational qualifications?\"  There was an impatient murmur around the table. The White Doctor looked up at Dal. \"Your name, please?\"  \"Dal Timgar, sir.\"  \"Your _full_ name,\" Black Doctor Tanner rumbled from the right-hand end of the table.  Dal took a deep breath and began to give his full Garvian name. It was untranslatable and unpronounceable to Earthmen, who could not reproduce the sequence of pops and whistles that made up the Garvian tongue. The doctors listened, blinking, as the complex family structure and ancestry which entered into every Garvian's full name continued to roll from Dal's lips. He was entering into the third generation removed of his father's lineage when Doctor Tanner held up his hand.  \"All right, all right! We will accept the abbreviated name you have used on Hospital Earth. Let it be clear on the record that the applicant is a native of the second planet of the Garv system.\" The Black Doctor settled back in his chair and began whispering again to the Blue Doctor next to him.  A Green Doctor cleared his throat. \"Doctor Timgar, what do you consider to be the basic principle that underlies the work and services of physicians of Hospital Earth?\"  It was an old question, a favorite on freshman medical school examinations. \"The principle that environments and life forms in the universe may be dissimilar, but that biochemical reactions are universal throughout creation,\" Dal said slowly.  \"Well memorized,\" Black Doctor Tanner said sourly. \"What does it mean?\"  \"It means that the principles of chemistry, physiology, pathology and the other life sciences, once understood, can be applied to any living creature in the universe, and will be found valid,\" Dal said. \"As different as the various life forms may be, the basic life processes in one life form are the same, under different conditions, as the life processes in any other life form, just as hydrogen and oxygen will combine to form water anywhere in the universe where the proper physical conditions prevail.\"  \"Very good, very good,\" the Green Doctor said. \"But tell me this: what in your opinion is the place of surgery in a Galactic practice of medicine?\"  A more"]]]
