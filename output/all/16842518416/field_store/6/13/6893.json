Francis Scott Key, lawyer, was born on the estate of his father, John Ross Key, in Frederick, Md., Aug. 1st, 1779; and died in Baltimore, Jan. 11, 1843. A bronze statue of him over his grave, and another in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, represent the nationality of his fame and the gratitude of a whole land.  Though a slaveholder by inheritance, Mr. Key deplored the existence of human slavery, and not only originated a scheme of African colonization, but did all that a model master could do for the chattels on his plantation, in compliance with the Scripture command,[6] to lighten their burdens. He helped them in their family troubles, defended them gratuitously in the courts, and held regular Sunday-school services for them.  [Footnote 6: Eph. 6:9, Coloss. 4:1.]  Educated at St. John's College, an active member of the Episcopal Church, he was not only a scholar but a devout and exemplary man.      Lord, with glowing heart I'd praise Thee       For the bliss Thy love bestows,     For the pardoning grace that saves me,       And the peace that from it flows.      Help, O Lord, my weak endeavor;       This dull soul to rapture raise;     Thou must light the flame or never       Can my love be warmed to praise.      Lord, this bosom's ardent feeling       Vainly would my life express;     Low before Thy footstool kneeling,       Deign Thy suppliant's prayer to bless.      Let Thy grace, my soul's chief treasure,       Love's pure flame within me raise,     And, since words can never measure,       Let my life show forth Thy praise.   _THE TUNE._  \"St. Chad,\" a choral in D, with a four-bar unison, in the _Evangelical Hymnal_, is worthy of the hymn. Richard Redhead, the composer, organist of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Paddington, Eng., was born at Harrow, Middlesex, March 1, 1820, and educated at Magdalene College, Oxford. Graduated Bachelor of Music at Oxford, 1871. He published _Laudes Dominæ_, a Gregorian Psalter, 1843, a Book of Tunes for the _Christian Year_, and is the author of much ritual music.   \"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY.\"  There is nothing so majestic in Protestant hymnology as this Tersanctus of Bishop Heber.  The Rt. Rev. Reginald Heber, son of a clergyman of the same name, was born in Malpas, Cheshire, Eng., April 21st, 1783, and educated at Oxford. He served the church in Hodnet, Shropshire, for about twenty years, and was then appointed Bishop of Calcutta, E.I. His labors there were cut short in the prime of his life, his death occurring in 1826, at Trichinopoly on the 3d of April, his natal month.  His hymns, numbering fifty-seven, were collected by his widow, and published with his poetical works in 1842.      Holy! holy! holy! Lord God Almighty!       Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.     Holy! holy! holy! merciful and mighty,       God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.      Holy! holy! holy! all the saints adore Thee,       Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;     Cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee,       Which wert, and art, and evermore shall be.   _THE TUNE._  Grand as the hymn is, it did not come to its full grandeur of sentiment and sound in song-worship till the remarkable music of Dr. John B. Dykes was joined to it. None was ever written that in performance illustrates more admirably the solemn beauty of congregational praise. The name \"Nicæa\" attached to the tune means nothing to the popular ear and mind, and it is known everywhere by the initial words of the first line.  Rev. John Bacchus Dykes, Doctor of Music, was born at Kingston-upon-Hull, in 1823; and graduated at Cambridge, in 1847. He became a master of tone and choral harmony, and did much to reform and elevate congregational psalmody in England. He was perhaps the first to demonstrate that hymn-tune making can be reduced to a science without impairing its spiritual purpose. Died Jan. 22, 1876.   \"LORD OF ALL BEING, THRONED AFAR.\"  This noble hymn was composed by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, born in Cambridge, Mass., 1809, and graduated at Harvard University. A physician by profession, he was known as a practitioner chiefly in literature, being a brilliant writer and long the leading poetical wit of America. He was, however, a man of deep religious feeling, and a devout attendant at King's Chapel, Unitarian, in Boston where he spent his life. He held the Harvard Professorship of Anatomy and Physiology more than fifty years, but his enduring work is in his poems, and his charming volume, _The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table_. Died Jan. 22, 1896.   _THE TUNE._  Holmes' hymn is sung in some churches to \"Louvan,\" V.C. Taylor's admirable praise tune. Other hymnals prefer with it the music of \"Keble,\" one of Dr. Dykes' appropriate and finished melodies.  Virgil Corydon Taylor, an American vocal composer, was born in Barkhamstead, Conn., April 2, 1817, died 1891.     CHAPTER II.  SOME HYMNS OF GREAT WITNESSES.   JOHN OF DAMASCUS.  [Greek: Erchesthe, ô pistoi,         Anastaseôs Hêmera.]  John of Damascus, called also St. John of Jerusalem, a theologian and poet, was the last but one of the Christian Fathers of the Greek Church. This eminent man was named by the Arabs \"Ibn Mansur,\" Son (Servant?) of a Conqueror, either in honor of his father Sergius or because it was a Semitic translation of his family title. He was born in Damascus early in the 8th century, and seems to have been in favor with the Caliph, and served under him many years in some important civil capacity, until, retiring to Palestine, he entered the monastic order, and late in life was ordained a priest of the Jerusalem Church. He died in the Convent of St. Sabas near that city about A.D. 780.  His lifetime appears to have been passed in comparative peace. Mohammed having died before completing the conquest of Syria, the Moslem rule before whose advance Oriental Christianity was to lose its first field of triumph had not yet asserted its persecuting power in the north. This devout monk, in his meditations at St. Sabas, dwelt much upon the birth and the resurrection of Christ, and made hymns to celebrate them. It was probably four hundred years before Bonaventura (?) wrote the Christmas \"Adeste Fideles\" of the Latin West that John of Damascus composed his Greek \"Adeste Fideles\" for a Resurrection song in Jerusalem.      Come ye faithful, raise the strain       Of triumphant gladness.         *       *       *       *       *     'Tis the spring of souls today       Christ hath burst His prison;     From the frost and gloom of death       Light and life have risen.  The nobler of the two hymns preserved to us, (or six stanzas of it) through eleven centuries is entitled \"The Day of Resurrection.\"      The day of resurrection,       Earth, tell its joys abroad:     The Passover of gladness,       The Passover of God.     From death to life eternal,       From earth unto the sky,     Our Christ hath brought us over,       With hymns of victory.      Our hearts be pure from evil,       That we may see aright     The Lord in rays eternal       Of resurrection light;     And, listening to His accents,       May hear, so calm and plain,     His own, \"All hail!\" and hearing,       May raise the victor-strain.      Now let the heavens be joyful,       Let earth her song begin,     Let all the world keep triumph,       All that dwell therein.     In grateful exultation,       Their notes let all things blend,     For Christ the Lord is risen,       O joy that hath no end!  Both these hymns of John of Damascus were translated by John Mason Neale.   _THE TUNE._  \"The Day of Resurrection\" is sung in the modern hymnals to the tune of \"Rotterdam,\" composed by Berthold of Tours, born in that city of the Netherlands, Dec. 17, 1838. He was educated at the conservatory in Leipsic, and later made London his permanent residence, writing both vocal and instrumental music. Died 1897. \"Rotterdam\" is a stately, sonorous piece and conveys the flavor of the ancient hymn.  \"Come ye faithful\" has for its modern interpreter Sir Arthur Sullivan, the celebrated composer of both secular and sacred works, but best known in hymnody as author of the great Christian march, \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\"  Hymns are known to have been written by the earlier Greek Fathers, Ephrem Syrus of Mesopotamia (A.D. 307-373), Basil the Great, Bishop of Cappadocia (A.D. 329-379) Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople (A.D. 335-390) and others, but their fragments of song which have come down to us scarcely rank them among the great witnesses--with the possible exception of the last name. An English scholar, Rev. Allen W. Chatfield, has translated the hymns extant of Gregory Nazianzen. The following stanzas give an idea of their quality. The lines are from an address to the Deity:      How, Unapproached! shall mind of man       Descry Thy dazzling throne,     And pierce and find Thee out, and scan       Where Thou dost dwell alone?      Unuttered Thou! all uttered things       Have had their birth from Thee;     The One Unknown, from Thee the spring       Of all we know and see.      And lo! all things abide in Thee       And through the complex whole,     Thou spreadst Thine own divinity,       Thyself of all the Goal.  This is reverent, but rather philosophical than evangelical, and reminds us of the Hymn of Aratus, more than two centuries before Christ was born.   ST. STEPHEN, THE SABAITE.  This pious Greek monk, (734-794,) nephew of St. John of Damascus, spent his life, from the age of ten, in the monastery of St. Sabas. His sweet hymn, known in Neale's translation,--      Art thou weary, art thou languid,       Art thou sore distrest?     Come to Me, saith One, and coming              Be at rest,  --is still in the hymnals, with the tunes of Dykes, and Sir Henry W. Baker (1821-1877), Vicar "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],["title","Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#0)"],["body","for the Study of Beat and Bohemian Literature (http://home.swbell.net/worchel/index.html)    Note: This book by Henry Murger, originally published in 1851, was       the source of two operas titled \"La Bohème\"--one by Giacomo       Puccini (1896) and the other by Ruggero Leoncavallo (1897).

Neither are they recruited from among the dancing-bear leaders, sword swallowers, gilt watch-guard vendors, street lottery keepers and a thousand other vague and mysterious professionals whose main business is to have no business at all, and who are always ready to turn their hands to anything except good.  The class of Bohemians referred to in this book are not a race of today, they have existed in all climes and ages, and can claim an illustrious descent. In ancient Greece, to go no farther back in this genealogy, there existed a celebrated Bohemian, who lived from hand to mouth round the fertile country of Ionia, eating the bread of charity, and halting in the evening to tune beside some hospitable hearth the harmonious lyre that had sung the loves of Helen and the fall of Troy. Descending the steps of time modern Bohemia finds ancestors at every artistic and literary epoch. In the Middle Ages it perpetuates the Homeric tradition with its minstrels and ballad makers, the children of the gay science, all the melodious vagabonds of Touraine, all the errant songsters who, with the beggar's wallet and the trouvere's harp slung at their backs, traversed, singing as they went, the plains of the beautiful land where the eglantine of Clemence Isaure flourished.  At the transitional period between the days of chivalry and the dawn of the Renaissance, Bohemia continued to stroll along all the highways of the kingdom, and already to some extent about the streets of Paris. There is Master Pierre Gringoire, friend of the vagrants and foe to fasting. Lean and famished as a man whose very existence is one long Lent, he lounges about the town, his nose in the air like a pointer's, sniffing the odor from kitchen and cook shop. His eyes glittering with covetous gluttony cause the hams hung outside the pork butcher's to shrink by merely looking at them, whilst he jingles in imagination--alas! and not in his pockets--the ten crowns promised him by the echevins in payment of the pious and devout fare he has composed for the theater in the hall of the Palais de Justice. Beside the doleful and melancholy figure of the lover of Esmeralda, the chronicles of Bohemia can evoke a companion of less ascetic humor and more cheerful face--Master François Villon, par excellence, is this latter, and one whose poetry, full of imagination, is no doubt on account of those presentiments which the ancients attributed to their fates, continually marked by a singular foreboding of the gallows, on which the said Villon one day nearly swung in a hempen collar for having looked too closely at the color of the king's crowns. This same Villon, who more than once outran the watch started in his pursuit, this noisy guest at the dens of the Rue Pierre Lescot, this spunger at the court of the Duke of Egypt, this Salvator Rosa of poesy, has strung together elegies the heartbreaking sentiment and truthful accents of which move the most pitiless and make them forget the ruffian, the vagabond and the debauchee, before this muse drowned in her own tears.  Besides, amongst all those whose but little known work has only been familiar to men for whom French literature does not begin the day when \"Malherbe came,\" François Villon has had the honor of being the most pillaged, even by the big-wigs of modern Parnassus. They threw themselves upon the poor man's field and coined glory from his humble treasure. There are ballads scribbled under a penthouse at the street corner on a cold day by the Bohemian rhapsodist, stanzas improvised in the hovel in which the \"belle qui fut haultmire\" loosened her gilt girdle to all comers, which now-a-days metamorphosed into dainty gallantries scented with musk and amber, figure in the armorial bearing enriched album of some aristocratic Chloris.  But behold the grand century of the Renaissance opens, Michaelangelo ascends the scaffolds of the Sistine Chapel and watches with anxious air young Raphael mounting the steps of the Vatican with the cartoon of the Loggie under his arm. Benvenuto Cellini is meditating his Perseus, Ghiberti is carving the Baptistery doors at the same time that Donatello is rearing his marbles on the bridges of the Arno; and whilst the city of the Medici is staking masterpieces against that of Leo X and Julius II, Titian and Paul Veronese are rendering the home of Doges illustrious. Saint Mark's competes with Saint Peter's.  This fever of genius that had broken out suddenly in the Italian peninsula with epidemic violence spreads its glorious contagion throughout Europe. Art, the rival of God, strides on, the equal of kings. Charles V stoops to pick up Titian's brush, and Francis I dances attendance at the printing office where Etienne Dolet is perhaps correcting the proofs of \"Pantagruel.\"  Amidst this resurrection of intelligence, Bohemia continued as in the past to seek, according to Balzac's expression, a bone and a kennel. Clement Marot, the familiar of the ante-chamber of the Louvre, became, even before she was a monarch's mistress, the favorite of that fair Diana, whose smile lit up three reigns. From the boudoir of Diane de Poitiers, the faithless muse of the poet passed to that of Marguerite de Valois, a dangerous favor that Marot paid for by imprisonment. Almost at the same epoch another Bohemian, whose childhood on the shores of Sorrento had been caressed by the kisses of an epic muse, Tasso, entered the court of the Duke of Ferrara as Marot had that of Francis I. But less fortunate than the lover of Diane and Marguerite, the author of \"Jerusalem Delivered\" paid with his reason and the loss of his genius the audacity of his love for a daughter of the house of Este.  The religious contests and political storms that marked the arrival of Medicis in France did not check the soaring flight of art. At the moment when a ball struck on the scaffold of the Fontaine des Innocents Jean Goujon who had found the Pagan chisel of Phidias, Ronsard discovered the lyre of Pindar and founded, aided by his pleiad, the great French lyric school. To this school succeeded the reaction of Malherbe and his fellows, who sought to drive from the French tongue all the exotic graces that their predecessors had tried to nationalize on Parnassus. It was a Bohemian, Mathurin Regnier, who was one of the last defenders of the bulwarks of poetry, assailed by the phalanx of rhetoricians and grammarians who declared Rabelais barbarous and Montaigne obscure. It was this same cynic, Mathurin Regnier, who, adding fresh knots to the satiric whip of Horace, exclaimed, in indignation at the manners of his day, \"Honor is an old saint past praying to.\"  The roll call of Bohemia during the seventeenth century contains a portion of the names belonging to the literature of the reigns of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, it reckons members amongst the wits of the Hôtel Rambouillet, where it takes its share in the production of the \"Guirlande de Julie,\" it has its entries into the Palais Cardinal, where it collaborates, in the tragedy of \"Marianne,\" with the poet-minister who was the Robespierre of the monarchy. It bestrews the couch of Marion Delorme with madrigals, and woos Ninon de l'Enclos beneath the trees of the Place Royal; it breakfasts in the morning at the tavern of the Goinfres or the Epee Royale, and sups in the evening at the table of the Duc de Joyeuse; it fights duels under a street lamp for the sonnet of Urania against the sonnet of Job. Bohemia makes love, war, and even diplomacy, and in its old days, weary of adventures, it turns the Old and New Testament into poetry, figures on the list of benefices, and well nourished with fat prebendaryships, seats itself on an episcopal throne, or a chair of the Academy, founded by one of its children.  It was in the transition period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries that appeared those two lofty geniuses, whom each of the nations amongst which they lived opposed to one another in their struggles of literary rivalry. Moliere and Shakespeare, those illustrious Bohemians, whose fate was too nearly akin.  The most celebrated names of the literature of the eighteenth century are also to be found in the archives of Bohemia, which, amongst the glorious ones of this epoch, can cite Jean Jacques Rousseau and d'Alembert, the foundling of the porch of Notre Dame, and amongst the obscure, Malfilâtre and Gilbert, two overrated reputations, for the inspiration of "]]]
