Half of each day is spent with the French troops, learning more quickly with an object lesson before them, and the remaining half day is spent in training by themselves.  The French squad goes through the drill or movement; then the American battalion, after watching them, is put through the same practice.  They are trained in bayonet work and charges, in musketry and machine gun practice, in the handling of grenades, and the throwing of bombs.  There is evidence of speeding up and an apparent pressure to get them quickly into shape, in order to take their place in the trenches before the winter sets in.  A few weeks at the front with the French troops will soon give them experience, and after a winter in the trenches, the men of these first divisions will doubtless form the nucleus for a large American army, and provide the drill masters quickly to train the men for the spring offensive.  On the day we were there, after a hard morning's drill, the Colonel assembled three battalions and put them through the first regimental formation and the first regimental review since landing in France.  The men of the First, Second, and Third battalions marched by, and one could quickly contrast the disciplined movements of the veterans or old soldiers with the crude drill of the new recruits, some of whom could not keep step or smoothly execute the movements.  At the noon hour, after the men had taken their midday meal and had rested for a few minutes, the Colonel asked us if we would address the troops.  Some two thousand men were marched in close formation around the large military wagon on which we were to stand.  The mules were unhitched and the men seated themselves on the grass, while the band played several pieces.  A great hunger of heart possesses any man with half a soul as he looks into the faces of these boys, beset by fierce temptations and facing a terrible winter in the trenches.  At the beginning we reminded them of the words of Lord Kitchener to his troops before they left for France: \"You are ordered abroad as a soldier. . . Remember that the honor of the Army depends upon your individual conduct. . .  Your duty cannot be done unless your health is sound.  So keep constantly on your guard against any excesses.  In this new experience you may find temptations both in wine and women.  You must entirely resist both temptations, . . . treating all women with perfect courtesy.\" [2]  Kitchener's words furnish a text for the two-fold danger which confronts these men.  Here for an unhurried hour, with the generous backing of the officers, we plead with the men on military, medical, and moral grounds, for the sake of their own homes and families, for the sake of conscience and country, on the grounds of duty both to God and to man, to hold to the high ideals and the best traditions of the homeland.  Here, with no church save the great dome of God's blue heaven above us, seated on the green grass, under the warm summer sun, we have the priceless privilege of trying to safeguard the life of these men in the grave danger of wartime.  We were encouraged alike by the splendid support of the officers and the warm-hearted and eager response of the men as they broke into prolonged applause.  The General in command attended one meeting and pledged us his support for our whole program for the men.  He had already cooperated with us most generously on the Canal Zone, in the Philippines, and in Mexico.  Three colonels presided at three successive meetings, and gave the work their strong moral support. Three bands were furnished in two days.  The official backing of the authorities placed the stamp of approval on the whole moral effort for the welfare of the men.  In no other army in Europe that we have seen have the officers taken such a keen interest in the highest welfare of the troops, or offered such constant and efficient cooperation with every effort to surround the men with the best moral influences.  After the meeting, the regimental parade and the strenuous physical drill of the morning, the Colonel called for a short break, and the men gathered to learn some popular songs.  Major Roosevelt assembled his battalion, and Archie Roosevelt enthusiastically led the men in singing Julia Ward Howe's \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and the modern soldier songs of the war.  After nine hours of hard drill, the men swung cheerfully down the hillside into the village street.  Now they have lined up, and with ravenous appetites are waiting for the evening meal.  We are almost as hungry as they, and are glad to share the meal with them.  Here on the table are huge piles of good home-made bread.  It is almost the first white bread we have seen after months of brown war bread in England and France.  Here are heaping plates of good pork and beans, tinned salmon, plenty of fried potatoes, and piping hot coffee.  This is followed by a delicious pudding, as good as the men would have had in their own homes.  Well fed, well clothed, well equipped, sleeping under Uncle Sam's warm blankets, on comfortable \"Gold Medal\" cots, our boys are well cared for.  In another village, at the close of the day, the Colonel commanding two battalions of the infantry called the men together in the open square of the market place, and after a band concert invited us to address the troops on the moral issues of the war.  The next day almost the same program was repeated, and at noon in an open field on a grassy hillside the Major of another battalion marched out his men for a similar lecture.  Every commanding officer seemed eager to arrange for meetings, to summon the men, and to back up the messages given to them. Not only have General Pershing, General Sibert, and the Colonels commanding the various regiments, met us half way in every plan for the welfare of the troops; but they have taken the initiative in insisting that every provision should be made for the physical, mental, and moral occupation and safeguarding of the men.  Probably more men are led astray in the war zone when they go on leave than at any other time, in reaction from the deadly monotony of camp life, or the inferno of the trenches.  London and Paris are the chief centers of danger.  In London, just before sailing for the States, we visited the finely equipped American \"Eagle\" Hut in the Strand.  It would be difficult to devise a more homelike or attractive place for soldiers.  In addition to sleeping accommodations for several hundred men, the lounge and recreation rooms, the big fireplaces and comfortable chairs suggested the equipment of an up-to-date club, in marked contrast to the surroundings of a cheerless soldiers' barracks.  [Illustration: The \"Eagle Hut\" in London.]  In Paris, in addition to the permanent headquarters at 31 Avenue Montaigne, we are hoping to provide hotels and hostels and guides for supervised parties to see the chief points of interest, and to plan such healthy occupation for the soldiers that the evils of the city may be counteracted.  Better still we are planning resorts in the French Alps, where summer and winter sports, athletics, mountain climbing, and physical and mental recreation will obviate altogether the necessity of leave to Paris for many of the soldiers of the United States and Canada.  In the first resort we are arranging for special rates and moderate charges at the hotels and have the pledge of the civil authorities to keep the place wholesome and absolutely to prevent the incoming of camp followers.  The Association is planning to take over the best hotel, which can be made into an attractive social center for the entire camp.  A score of American and as many Canadian ladies will help to provide social recreation and amusement for the men, which will prove a greater attraction than the dangerous leave in Paris.  A glance at one or two typical meetings held in various camps will show how we are trying to help our boys face the pressing problems of a soldier's life.  We enter a large hut filled with a thousand soldiers.  Here are many men who have been driven toward God and who are face to face with the great realities of life, death, and the future as never before in their lives, eager for any message which may help them.  But here are several hundred others who have fallen victims to evil habits and who are determined you shall not force religion down their throats.  How are we to capture the attention of this mass of men and hold them?  Will they bolt or stand fire?  The time has come to begin the meeting and we plunge in.  \"Come on, boys, let's have a sing-song; gather round the piano and let's sing some of the old camp songs.\"  Out come the little camp song books, and we start in on a few favorite choruses.  A dozen voices call for \"John Brown's Body,\" \"Tennessee,\" \"Kentucky Home,\" \"A Long, Long Trail,\" etc.  Soon we have several hundred men seated around the piano and the chorus gathers in volume.  Now we call for local talent.  A boy with blue eyes and a clear tenor voice sings of home.  A red-headed humorist climbs on the table; and at his impersonations, his acting, and comic songs, the crowd shouts with glee.  Our heart sinks within us as we look over this sea of faces and wonder how we are going to hold this crowd that this man seems to have in the hollow of his hand.  Somehow these men must be gripped and held to the last.  \"Boys, what was the greatest battle of the war?\" we ask.  \"Was it the brave stand of little Belgium at Liege?  Was it the splendid retreat of the little British army from Mons?  Was it the battle of the Marne, when the French and British struck their first offensive blow? Was it the great stand at Ypres, or the defense of Verdun, or the drive on the Somme?  What is _your_ hardest battle?  Is it not within, in the fight with passion?  Now is the time to challenge every sin that weakens a man or the nation.  How about drink?  Is it a friend or foe? How about gambling?  How about impurity?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18325"],["title","With Our Soldiers in France (#5)"],["body","  Here we mass our guns on the greatest danger of the war.  In five minutes the room is quiet, in ten minutes we have the ear of every man in the hut, the last man has stopped talking, and now the battle is on.  They are gripped on the moral question; how can we get them to the religious issue?  These men have the root of religion in their souls, but they do not know it. They believe in strength, in purity, in generosity.  We show that they are often falling before temptation, but the very things that they most admire are all found in their fulness in Jesus Christ.  Now we make use of a simple illustration.  We hold up a gold coin hidden in our hand and offer it as a gift.  \"Who will take me at my word and ask for this gift?\"  At last a man rises in the back of the hall, there is a little scene, and then a burst of applause as he receives it and goes to his seat.  \"Now why didn't _you_ come?  Some of you didn't believe me, some were ashamed to come up before everybody and ask for it, some were just waiting; and so all lost your chance. Once again I offer a gift.  Here is something more valuable than all the gold on earth--heaven to be had for the asking; the free gift of God is eternal life.  Why don't you come?  For the same three reasons. Some of you don't believe, some are afraid to show their colors, some are just waiting.  You will soon start for the front to take your place in the trenches.  Are you ready for life or death?  What will you do with Jesus Christ?\"  We have had them forty minutes now and many a man is listening as for his life.  We hold up the pledge card of the war roll.  \"How many of you are willing to take your stand against drink, gambling, and impurity, to break away from sin, and to sign the war roll, which says: 'I pledge my allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ as my Saviour and King, by God's help to fight His battles and bring victory to His Kingdom'?  Who will take his stand for Christ and sign tonight?\"  Here and there all over the house men begin to rise.  A hundred come forward to get cards and sign them.  Then every head is bowed and in the stillness we pray for these boys; for they are mere lads, with ruddy checks, fresh from the farm or the city.  Now the meeting breaks up and we move down into the crowd.  Men come up and ask for private talks, some to confess their sins and others to request prayer.  Here is a boy who is friendless and homeless and in need; the next man has just lost his wife, his home, and his money, but here in the war he has been driven to prayer and has found God.  He has lost everything, but he tells us with a brave smile that he has gained all, and now wishes to prepare for the ministry to preach the Gospel. Next is a young atheist, an illegitimate child, a circus actor, who has now found God and wants to know how to relate his life to Christ.  The next man is a jockey, who in the midst of his sins enlisted in order that he might die for others and try to atone for his past life.  Later, we were holding evangelistic meetings among the boys of another regiment.  One Sunday evening we were in a big hut where the meeting was about to begin.  Many of the men were writing to the old folks at home.  Captain \"Peg\" of Canada, who was with us to lead the singing, stepped on the platform and announced a hymn.  Immediately several hundred men flocked to the seats and began singing the Christian hymns they knew at home.  Eyes lit up and faces were aglow as they sang \"Nearer, My God, to Thee,\" \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" and \"Fight the Good Fight.\"  Gradually the numbers increased until a thousand men were singing.  Then we began the address.  Here were open-hearted boys some of whom had gone down before the temptations of the port cities and who now have to face the dangers of a camp in France.  We began on moral themes.  Within half an hour it seemed as if the better nature of every man was with us.  The Christian ideals of home, of the Church, and of their own best selves surged up again, until we had seated and standing nearly twelve hundred men, many of whom were ready to make the fight for purity with the help of Jesus Christ.  One can never forget that closing hymn as the men rose to sing \"God Be With You Till We Meet Again.\"  We saw tear-stained faces before us as nearly the whole company joined in the song \"Tell Mother I'll Be There.\"  Here was one poor fellow who felt he could not sign the decision card. He sent up this little note: \"I am the worst man in the tent--a man who robbed his old father of his life's savings.  How can I hope to be any good again without any prospect of ever being able to repay this money?\"  But before he left he had accepted God's forgiveness, and the dawn of a new eternity breaks upon his happy face.  There was another man, the worst character in the regiment.  Finally, touched by the secretary's kindness, he had read his little pocket Testament in prison, had yielded his life to Christ, and was now witnessing among the soldiers in the camp.  Another, broken down, came up to say he had wronged a girl at home, and to ask if there was any hope for him.  The last man, Bob A----, serving at present with a British regiment, tells us he was a Christian in Cleveland, Ohio, before the war.  He lay all last night drunk in the fields, but, convicted of his profligate life, he repented and turned back again to God.  There was another boy who stopped to tell us that ever since a previous meeting he had knelt in prayer every night before all the men.  At the close of the meeting another man stepped up and handed in a letter, saying: \"Thank you for that message tonight, sir.  I will be true to the little girl I left at home.  Here is a letter I had just written to a bad woman.  God helping me I will not go.  I have signed the War Roll tonight and I am going to be true to it.\"  Hundreds of men filed past and shook hands in gratitude.  We were facing an average of some five hundred men every night in the week and a thousand or more on Sunday.  One humble private who had been a pilot out at sea, handed us a poem which he had just written, the last lines of which are typical of the verses many of the men are writing these days:    \"And if I fall, Lord, take an erring mortal     Into those realms of peace and joy above;   And, by-and-by, at Thy fair mansion's portal,     Let me find there the little girl I love.\"   In all our meetings our aim has been to enable men to find themselves by coming into a personal and vital relation with God as Father, through Jesus Christ.  Our purpose is to evangelize, but not to proselytize.  We aim to make each man more loyal to his own church. During the three years of the war, we have never known of a man changing his church or being asked to do so.  Our aim is not to change any man's ecclesiastical position, but to make him a truer and stronger man in the church where he is.  The great outstanding issue in war time is not between creed and creed, between sect and sect, but between God and mammon, between right and wrong, purity and impurity.  We have no contention concerning the questions that divide us; we are fighting for the great fundamentals upon which we are all united, for God and moral manhood.   [1] According to the War Bulletin of the National Geographic Society, issued in Washington in September 1917, a first class American private drawing $26.60 a month receives more than a Russian colonel or a German or Austrian lieutenant.  An American lieutenant receives more than a British lieutenant colonel, a French colonel, or a Russian general.  [2] See Appendix IV.     CHAPTER III  A DAY IN THE \"BULL RING\"  Just before going into the trenches the British, French, and American troops take a final course for a few weeks in a training school, where the expert drill masters put them through a rigorous discipline, and the finishing touches are given to each regiment.  At the moment of writing our American boys are going through such a course, \"somewhere in France.\"  The men commonly call this training school, or specially prepared final drill ground, the \"Bull Ring.\"  It is a thrilling spectacle to see many thousands of men across a vast plain going through the various maneuvers of actual warfare as it is practiced today at the front.  Perhaps a brief description of such a drill ground may be of interest to those who are following the fortunes of our soldiers.  At six the bugle sounds and the whole camp is astir.  Outside there is the clatter of feet as the men fall in after a hasty breakfast.  The shrapnel-proof steel helmets are donned, the heavy seventy-pound kits and rifles are swung to the broad backs, the band strikes up \"Pack Up Your Troubles,\" and our battalion is on the march for the \"Bull Ring.\"  First comes the ceremonial parade.  A whole brigade swings into line and must prove that it can move as one man, as a perfect machine, without flaw or friction.  One master mind directs every motion, and at the word of command thousands of feet are moving in exact time, wheeling, marching, maneuvering with a precision that proves the long months of patient practice.  This finish of discipline and perfection of unity have their part to play in the winning of the battle raging at this moment up the line.  Next the men must pass through the deadly gas chambers, to be ready to meet the attack of the enemy fully prepared.  More fatal than the prussic acid which the Prussian has occasionally employed, is the deadly mixture of chlorine and phosgene, which has been most commonly used.  In a gentle favoring wind it is put over invisible in the darkness, and if it catches the foe unprepared, can kill from ten to fifteen miles behind the lines.  The mixture is squirted as a liquid from metal generators.  It quickly forms a dense greenish yellow cloud of poison vapor, which floats away in the darkness.  Its success must depend on the element of surprise, taking the enemy unprepared and choking him, awake or asleep, in the"]]]
