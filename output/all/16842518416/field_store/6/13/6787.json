And so into the hall they wended, the Kings and their mighty ones;     And they dight the feast full glorious, and drank through the       death of the day,     Till the shadowless moon rose upward, till it wended white away;     Then they went to the gold-hung beds, and at last for an hour or twain     Were all things still and silent, save a flaw of the summer rain.      But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare,     More glorious was the banquet, and now was Signy there,     And she sat beside King Siggeir, a glorious bride forsooth;     Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast's tooth,     But she neither laughed nor spake, and her eyes were hard and cold,     And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold.     That saw Sigmund her brother, the eldest Volsung son,     And oft he looked upon her, and their eyes met now and anon,     And ruth arose in his heart, and hate of Siggeir the Goth,     And there had he broken the wedding, but for plighted promise and       troth.     But those twain were beheld of Siggeir, and he deemed of the       Volsung kin,     That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win;     Yet thereof made he no semblance, but abided times to be     And laughed out with the loudest, amid the hope and the glee.     And nought of all saw Volsung, as he dreamed of the coming glory,     And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world's       story.      So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold;     And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old,     Yet had they tales for songcraft, and the blossomed garth of rhyme;     Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time     From the halls of the outer heaven; so near they knew the door.     Wherefore uprose a sea-king, and his hands that loved the oar     Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold, and he sang of the shaping       of earth,     And how the stars were lighted, and where the winds had birth,     And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.     But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass     O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about     And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.     Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,     One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed:     Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-grey     As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way:     A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam     Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver's gleam.     And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told     Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in       the wold.      So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord,     But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,     And smote it deep in the tree-bole, and the wild hawks overhead     Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:     \"Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,     Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!     The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel     Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.     Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift     To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift.     Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail     Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.     Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise,     And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:     For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain side,     That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,     And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest     While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,     And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile:--     All hail to thee King Volsung! farewell for a little while!\"      So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,     That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream     We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,     And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;     And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,     For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to       praise.      But now spake Volsung the King: \"Why sit ye silent and still?     Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?     Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths arise,     And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise!     Yet deem it not too easy; for belike a fateful blade     Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made.\"      Now therewith spake King Siggeir: \"King Volsung give me a grace     To try it the first of all men, lest another win my place     And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win.\"      Then somewhat laughed King Volsung, and he said: \"O Guest, begin;     Though herein is the first as the last, for the Gods have long to live,     Nor hath Odin yet forgotten unto whom the gift he would give.\"      Then forth to the tree went Siggeir, the Goth-folk's mighty lord,     And laid his hand on the gemstones, and strained at the glorious sword     Till his heart grew black with anger; and never a word he said     As he wended back to the high-seat: but Signy waxed blood-red     When he sat him adown beside her; and her heart was nigh to break     For the shame and the fateful boding: and therewith King Volsung spake:      \"Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth,     And how shall the feeble venture? yet each man knows his worth;     And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring     To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King:     So stand forth free and unfree; stand forth both most and least:     But first ye Earls of the Goth-folk, ye lovely lords we feast.\"      Upstood the Earls of Siggeir, and each man drew anigh     And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high;     But for all their mighty shaping and their deeds in the battle-wood,     No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood.     Then uprose Volsung's homemen, and the fell-abiding folk;     And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak,     And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar:     And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war.     But for all their mighty shaping, and the struggle and the strain     Of their hands, the deft in labour, they tugged thereat in vain;     And still as the shouting and jeers, and the names of men and the       laughter     Beat backward from gable to gable, and rattled o'er roof-tree and       rafter,     Moody and still sat Siggeir; for he said: \"They have trained me here     As a mock for their woodland bondsmen; and yet shall they buy it dear.\"      Now the tumult sank a little, and men cried on Volsung the King     And his sons, the hedge of battle, to try the fateful thing.     So Volsung laughed, and answered: \"I will set me to the toil,     Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil.     Yet nought am I ill-sworded, and the oldest friend is best;     And this, my hand's first fellow, will I bear to the grave-mound's       rest,     Nor wield meanwhile another: Yea this shall I have in hand     When mid the host of Odin in the Day of Doom I stand.\"      Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath,     And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death:     Then he laid his hand on the Branstock, and cried: \"O tree beloved,     I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved:     Abide thou thus, green bower, when I am dead and gone     And the best of all my kindred a better day hath won!\"      Then as a young man laughed he, and on the hilts of gold     His hand, the battle-breaker, took fast and certain hold,     And long he drew and strained him, but mended not the tale,     Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail;     But he wended to the high-seat and thence began to cry:      \"Sons I have gotten and cherished, now stand ye forth to try;     Lest Odin tell in God-home how from the way he strayed,     And how to the man he would not he gave away his blade.\"     So therewithal rose Rerir, and wasted might and main;     Then Gunthiof, and then Hunthiof, they wearied them in vain;     Nought was the might of Agnar; nought Helgi could avail;     Sigi the tall and Solar no further brought the tale,     Nor Geirmund the priest of the temple, nor Gylfi of the wood.      At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,     And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,     Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought:     When lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,     For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out     As high o'er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away     From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose       it lay.     A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall,     Like the best of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#2)"],["body","of the garden, when the April sunbeams fall     On its blossomed boughs in the morning, and tell of the days to be;     Then back unto the high-seat he wended soberly;     For this was the thought within him; Belike the day shall come     When I shall bide here lonely amid the Volsung home,     Its glory and sole avenger, its after-summer seed.     Yea, I am the hired of Odin, his workday will to speed,     And the harvest-tide shall be heavy.--What then, were it come and past     And I laid by the last of the sheaves with my wages earned at the last?      He lifted his eyes as he thought it, for now was he come to his place,     And there he stood by his father and met Siggeir face to face,     And he saw him blithe and smiling, and heard him how he spake:     \"O best of the sons of Volsung, I am merry for thy sake     And the glory that thou hast gained us; but whereas thine hand and       heart     Are e'en now the lords of the battle, how lack'st thou for thy part     A matter to better the best? Wilt thou overgild fine gold     Or dye the red rose redder? So I prithee let me hold     This sword that comes to thine hand on the day I wed thy kin.     For at home have I a store-house; there is mountain-gold therein     The weight of a war-king's harness; there is silver plenteous store;     There is iron, and huge-wrought amber, that the southern men love sore,     When they sell me the woven wonder, the purple born of the sea;     And it hangeth up in that bower; and all this is a gift for thee:     But the sword that came to my wedding, methinketh it meet and right,     That it lie on my knees in the council and stead me in the fight.\"      But Sigmund laughed and answered, and he spake a scornful word:     \"And if I take twice that treasure, will it buy me Odin's sword,     And the gift that the Gods have given? will it buy me again to stand     Betwixt two mightiest world-kings with a longed-for thing in mine hand     That all their might hath missed of? when the purple-selling men     Come buying thine iron and amber, dost thou sell thine honour then?     Do they wrap it in bast of the linden, or run it in moulds of earth?     And shalt thou account mine honour as a matter of lesser worth?     Came the sword to thy wedding, Goth-king, to thine hand it never came,     And thence is thine envy whetted to deal me this word of shame.\"      Black then was the heart of Siggeir, but his face grew pale and red,     Till he drew a smile thereover, and spake the word and said:     \"Nay, pardon me, Signy's kinsman! when the heart desires o'ermuch     It teacheth the tongue ill speaking, and my word belike was such.     But the honour of thee and thy kindred, I hold it even as mine,     And I love you as my heart-blood, and take ye this for a sign.     I bid thee now King Volsung, and these thy glorious sons,     And thine earls and thy dukes of battle and all thy mighty ones,     To come to the house of the Goth-kings as honoured guests and dear     And abide the winter over; that the dusky days and drear     May be glorious with thy presence, that all folk may praise my life,     And the friends that my fame hath gotten; and that this my new-wed wife     Thine eyes may make the merrier till she bear my eldest born.\"     Then speedily answered Volsung: \"No king of the earth might scorn     Such noble bidding, Siggeir; and surely will I come     To look upon thy glory and the Goths' abundant home.     But let two months wear over, for I have many a thing     To shape and shear in the Woodland, as befits a people's king:     And thou meanwhile here abiding of all my goods shalt be free,     And then shall we twain together roof over the glass-green sea     With the sides of our golden dragons; and our war-hosts' blended       shields     Shall fright the sea-abiders and the folk of the fishy fields.\"      Answered the smooth-speeched Siggeir: \"I thank thee well for this,     And thy bidding is most kingly; yet take it not amiss     That I wend my ways in the morning; for we Goth-folk know indeed     That the sea is a foe full deadly, and a friend that fails at need,     And that Ran who dwells thereunder will many a man beguile:     And I bear a woman with me; nor would I for a while     Behold that sea-queen's dwelling; for glad at heart am I     Of the realm of the Goths and the Volsungs, and I look for long to lie     In the arms of the fairest woman that ever a king may kiss.     So I go mine house to order for the increase of thy bliss,     That there in nought but joyance all we may wear the days     And that men of the time hereafter the more our lives may praise.\"      And for all the words of Volsung e'en so must the matter be,     And Siggeir the Goth and Signy on the morn shall sail the sea.     But the feast sped on the fairer, and the more they waxed in disport     And the glee that all men love, as they knew that the hours were short.     Yet a boding heart bare Sigmund amid his singing and laughter;     And somewhat Signy wotted of the deeds that were coming after;     For the wisest of women she was, and many a thing she knew;     She would hearken the voice of the midnight till she heard what the       Gods would do,     And her feet fared oft on the wild, and deep was her communing     With the heart of the glimmering woodland, where never a fowl may sing.      So fair sped on the feasting amid the gleam of the gold,     Amid the wine and the joyance; and many a tale was told     To the harp-strings of that wedding, whereof the latter days     Yet hold a little glimmer to wonder at and praise.     Then the undark night drew over, and faint the high stars shone,     And there on the beds blue-woven the slumber-tide they won;     Yea while on the brightening mountain the herd-boy watched his sheep.     Yet soft on the breast of Signy King Siggeir lay asleep.       _How the Volsungs fared to the Land of the Goths, and of the fall of     King Volsung._      Now or ever the sun shone houseward, unto King Volsung's bed     Came Signy stealing barefoot, and she spake the word and said:     \"Awake and hearken, my father, for though the wedding be done,     And I am the wife of the Goth-king, yet the Volsungs are not gone.     So I come as a dream of the night, with a word that the Gods would say,     And think thou thereof in the day-tide, and let Siggeir go on his way     With me and the gifts and the gold, but do ye abide in the land,     Nor trust in the guileful heart and the murder-loving hand,     Lest the kin of the Volsungs perish, and the world be nothing worth.\"      So came the word unto Volsung, and wit in his heart had birth;     And he sat upright in the bed and kissed her on the lips;     But he said: \"My word is given, it is gone like the spring-tide ships:     To death or to life must I journey when the months are come to an end.     Yet my sons my words shall hearken, and shall nowise with me wend.\"      Then she answered, speaking swiftly: \"Nay, have thy sons with thee;     Gather an host together and a mighty company,     And meet the guile and the death-snare with battle and with wrack.\"      He said: \"Nay, my troth-word plighted e'en so should I draw aback:     I shall go a guest, as my word was; of whom shall I be afraid?     For an outworn elder's ending shall no mighty moan be made.\"      Then answered Signy, weeping: \"I shall see thee yet again     When the battle thou arrayest on the Goth-folks' strand in vain.     Heavy and hard are the Norns: but each man his burden bears;     And what am I to fashion the fate of the coming years?\"      She wept and she wended back to the Goth-king's bolster blue,     And Volsung pondered awhile till slumber over him drew;     But when once more he wakened, the kingly house was up,     And the homemen gathered together to drink the parting cup:     And grand amid the hall-floor was the Goth king in his gear,     And Signy clad for faring stood by the Branstock dear     With the earls of the Goths about her: so queenly did she seem,     So calm and ruddy coloured, that Volsung well might deem     That her words were a fashion of slumber, a vision of the night.     But they drank the wine of departing, and brought the horses dight,     And forth abroad the Goth-folk and the Volsung Children rode,     Nor ever once would Signy look back to that abode.      So down over acre and heath they rode to the side of the sea,     And there by the long-ships' bridges was the ship-host's company.     Then Signy kissed her brethren with ruddy mouth and warm,     Nor was there one of the Goth-folk but blessed her from all harm;     Then sweet she kissed her father and hung about his neck,     And sure she whispered him somewhat ere she passed forth toward the       deck,     Though nought I know to tell it: then Siggeir hailed them fair,     And called forth many a blessing on the hearts that bode his snare.     Then were the gangways shipped, and blown was the parting horn,     And the striped sails drew with the wind, and away was Signy borne     White on the shielded long-ship, a grief in the heart of the gold;     Nor once would she turn her about the strand of her folk to behold.      Thenceforward dwelt the Volsungs in exceeding glorious state,     And merry lived King Volsung, abiding the day of his fate;     But when the months aforesaid were well-nigh worn away     To his sons and his folk of counsel he fell these words to say:     \"Ye mind you of Signy's wedding and of my plighted troth     To go in two months' wearing to the house of Siggeir the Goth:     Nor will I hide how Signy then spake a warning word     And did me to wit that her husband was a grim and guileful lord,     And would draw us to our undoing for envy and despite     Concerning the Sword of Odin, and for dread of the Volsung might.     Now wise is Signy my daughter and knoweth nought but sooth:     Yet are there seasons and times when for longing and self-ruth     The hearts of "]]]
