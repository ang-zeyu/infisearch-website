Now hoo in this world's a man to make honest profit on a commodity he entrusts--\"  \"Sh! sh! You're raising your voice again,\" said I. \"Where's your hand? It's only a cake, but it'll be better than nothing.\" And I held out the cake Biddy had made me put in my pocket.  \"I'll no take it from ye. Keep it for your own needs; I'm harder than yourself, it's likely,\" he said, pushing my hand aside, and added almost peevishly, \"but keep the smell of it from me.\"  \"I can spare it perfectly,\" I whispered. \"I've had plenty to eat quite lately.\"  I shall never forget how he clutched it then. I could hear his teeth clash with the eagerness of his eating. It almost frightened me in the darkness.  \"Eh! man, that was good!\" he gasped. \"Are ye sure indeed and in truth ye could spare it all? I didn't think they made such bannocks out of Scotland. But we've much to learn in all matters, doubtless. Thank ye a thousand times.\"  \"The old Irishwoman gave it me!\" I said with some malice. \"She made me put it in my pocket, though she had given me a good meal before, for which she would take nothing.\"  \"It was leeberal of her,\" said Alister Auchterlay. \"Verra leeberal; but there are good Christians to be met with, amongst all sorts, there's not a doot aboot it.\"  I should probably have pursued my defence of Biddy against this grudging--not to say insulting--tribute to her charity, if I had not begun to feel too tired to talk, and very much teased by the heaving of the vessel.  \"I wish the ship would be quiet till we start,\" I said. \"We're not at sea yet.\"  In reply to this Alister at some length, and with as much emphasis as whispering permitted, explained to me that a ship could not, in the nature of things, keep still, except in certain circumstances, such as being in dry dock for repairs or lying at anchor in absolutely still water.  \"Good gracious!\" I interrupted. \"Of course I know all that. You don't suppose I expect it not to move?\"  \"I understood ye to say that ye wushed it,\" he replied with dignity, if not offence.  \"I don't know what I wish!\" I moaned.  My companion's reply to this was to feel about for me and then to begin scrambling over me; then he said--\"Move on, laddie, to your right, and ye'll find space to lie on the flat of your back, close by the ship's side. I'm feared you're barely fit for the job ye've undertaken, but ye'll be easier if ye lie down, and get some sleep.\"  I moved as he told me, and the relief of lying flat was great--so great that I began to pull myself together again, and made ready in my mind to thank my unseen companion for the generosity with which he had evidently given me the place he had picked for himself. But whilst I was thinking about it I fell fast asleep.  When I woke, for the first minute I thought I was at home, and I could not conceive what Martha could be doing, that there should be, as far as one could hear, chimney-sweeping, cinder-riddling, furniture-moving, clock-winding, and Spring-cleaning, of the most awful nature, all going on at once, and in a storm of yelling and scolding, which was no part of our domestic ways. But in another minute I knew where I was, and by the light coming through a little round porthole above me, I could see my companion.  He was still sleeping, so that I could satisfy my keen curiosity without rudeness. He had indeed given up the only bit of space to me, and was himself doubled up among lumber in a fashion that must have been very trying to the length of his limbs. For he was taller than I, though not, I thought, much older; two years or so, perhaps. The cut of his clothes (not their raggedness, though they were ragged as well as patched) confirmed me in my conviction that he was \"not exactly a gentleman\"; but I felt a little puzzled about him, for, broad as his accent was, he was even less exactly of the Tim Binder and Bob Furniss class.  He was not good-looking, and yet I hardly know any word that would so fittingly describe his face in the repose of sleep, and with that bit of light concentrated upon it, as the word \"noble.\" It was drawn and pinched with pain and the endurance of pain, and I never saw anything so thin, except his hands, which lay close to his sides--both clenched. But I do think he would have been handsome if his face had not been almost aggressively intelligent when awake, and if his eyebrows and eyelashes had had any colour. His hair was fair but not bright, and it was straight without being smooth, and tossed into locks that had no grace or curl. And why he made me think of a Bible picture--Jacob lying at the foot of the ladder to heaven, or something of that sort--I could not tell, and did not puzzle myself to wonder, for the ship was moving, and there was a great deal to be seen out of the window, tiny as it was.  It looked on to the dock, where men were running about in the old bewildering fashion. To-day it was not so bewildering to me, because I could see that the men were working with some purpose that affected our vessel, though the directions in which they ran, dragging ropes as thick as my leg, to the grinding of equally monstrous chains, were as mysterious as the figures of some dance one does not know. As to the noises they made, men and boys anywhere are given to help on their work with sounds of some sort, but I could not have believed in anything approaching to these, out of a lunatic asylum, unless I had heard them.  I could hear quite well, I could hear what was said, and a great deal of it, I am sorry to say, would have been better unsaid. But the orders which rang out interested me, for I tried to fit them on to what followed, though without much result. At last the dock seemed to be moving away from me--I saw men, but not the same men--and every man's eye was fixed on us. Then the thick brown rope just below my window quivered like a bow-string, and tightened (all the water starting from it in a sparkling shower) till it looked as firm as a bar of iron, and I held on tight, for we were swinging round. Suddenly the voice of command sang out--(I fancied with a touch of triumph in the tone)--\"Let go the warp!\" The thick rope sprang into the air, and wriggled like a long snake, and it was all I could do to help joining in the shouts that rang from the deck above and from the dock below. Then the very heart of the ship began to beat with a new sound, and the Scotch lad leaped like a deerhound to the window, and put his arm round my shoulder, and whispered, \"That's the screw, man! _we're off_!\"     CHAPTER IV.             \"He that tholes o'ercomes.\"            \"Tak' your venture, as mony a gude ship has done.\"                                                 _Scotch Proverbs_.   I am disposed to think that a ship is a place where one has occasional moments of excitement and enthusiasm that are rare elsewhere, but that it is not to be beaten (if approached) for the deadliness of the despondency to be experienced therein.  For perhaps a quarter of an hour after our start I felt much excited, and so, I think, did my companion. Shoulder to shoulder we were glued to the little round window, pinching each other when the hurrying steps hither and thither threatened to come down our way. We did not talk much, we were too busy looking out, and listening to the rushing water, and the throbbing of the screw. The land seemed to slip quickly by, countless ships, boats, and steamers barely gave us time to have a look at them, though Alister (who seemed to have learned a good deal during his four days in the docks) whispered little bits of information about one and another. Then the whole shore seemed to be covered by enormous sheds, and later on it got farther off, and then the land lay distant, and it was very low and marshy and most dreary-looking, and I fancied it was becoming more difficult to keep my footing at the window; and just when Alister had been pointing out a queer red ship with one stumpy mast crowned by a sort of cage, and telling me that it was a light-ship, our own vessel began to creak and groan worse than ever, and the floor under our feet seemed to run away from them, and by the time you had got used to going down, it caught you and jerked you up again, till my head refused to think anything about anything, and I half dropped and was half helped by Alister on to the flat of my back as before.  As to him, I may as well say at once, that I never knew him affected at sea by the roughest wind that could blow, and he sat on a box and looked at me half pityingly, and half, I suppose, with the sort of curiosity I had felt about him.  \"I'm feared the life 'll be a bit over rough for ye,\" he said kindly. \"Would ye think of going up and disclosing yourself before we're away from all chance of getting ashore?\"  \"No, no!\" said I, vehemently, and added more feebly, \"I dare say I shall be all right soon.\"  \"Maybe,\" said the Scotchman.  He went back to the window and gazed out, seeing, I have no doubt, plenty to interest him; though my eyes, if opened for a moment, only shrank back and closed again instinctively, with feelings of indescribable misery. So indefinite time went on, Alister occasionally making whispered comments which I did not hear, and did not trouble myself to ask questions about, being utterly indifferent to the answers. But I felt no temptation to give in, I only remember feeling one intense desire, and it amounted to a prayer, that if these intolerable sensations did not abate, I might at any rate become master enough of them to do my duty "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18156"],["title","We and the World: A Book for Boys. Part II (#5)"],["body","their teeth. The thought made me more alert, and when the Scotch lad warned me that steps were coming our way, I implored him to hide deeper under the sails, if he wished, without consideration for me, as I had resolved to face my fate at once, and be either killed or cured.  \"Thank ye kindly,\" said Alister, \"but there's small use in hiding now. They can but pitch us overboard, and I've read that drowning is by far an easier death than being starved, if ye come to that.\"  It was in this frame of mind that a sailor found us, and took us prisoners with so little difficulty that he drew the scarcely fair conclusion that we were the cheekiest, coolest hands of all the nasty, sneaking, longshore loafers he had ever had to deal with in all his blessed and otherwise than blessed born days. And wrathful as this outburst was, it was colourless to the indignation in his voice, when (replying to some questions from above) he answered,  \"Two on 'em!\"  Several other sailors came to the help of our captor, and we were dragged up the ladder and on deck, where the young Scotchman looked to better advantage than down below, and where I made the best presentment of myself that my miserable condition would allow. We were soon hauled before the captain, a sensible-faced, red-bearded man, with a Scotch accent rather harsher than Alister's, in which he harangued us in very unflattering phrases for our attempt to \"steal a passage,\" and described the evil fate of which we were certain, if we did not work uncommonly hard for our victuals.  With one breath I and my companion asserted our willingness to do anything, and that to get a free passage as idlers was our last wish and intention. To this, amid appreciating chuckles from the crew, the captain replied, that, so sneaks and stowaways always _said_; a taunt which was too vulgar as repartee to annoy me, though I saw Alister's thin hands clenching at his sides. I don't know if the captain did, but he called out--\"Here! you lanky lad there, show your hands.\"  \"They're no idle set,\" said Alister, stretching them out. He lifted his eyes as he said it, and I do not think he could have repressed the flash in them to save his life. Every detail of the scene was of breathless interest to me, and as I watched to see if the captain took offence, I noticed that (though they were far less remarkable from being buried in a fat and commonplace countenance) his eyes, like Alister's, were of that bright, cold, sea-blue common among Scotchmen. He did not take offence, and I believe I was right in thinking that the boy's wasted hands struck him much as they had struck me.  \"Don't speak unless I question you. How long will ye have been hanging round the docks before ye'd the impudence to come aboard here?\"  \"I slept four nights in the docks, sir.\"  \"And where did ye take your meals?\"  A flush crept over Alister's bony face. \"I'm no' a great eater, sir,\" he said, with his eyes on the deck: and then suddenly lifting a glance at me out of the corner of them, he added, \"The last I had was just given me by a freen'.\"  \"That'll do. Put your hands down. Can you sew?\"  \"I ask your pardon, sir?\"  \"Is the fool deaf? Can ye use a needle and thread?\"  \"After a rough fashion, sir, and I can knit a bit.\"  \"Mr. Waters?\"  A man with a gold band round his cap stepped forward and touched it.  \"Take him to the sail-maker. He can help to patch the old fore-stay-sail on the forecastle. And you can--\"  The rest of the order was in a low voice, but Mr. Waters saluted again and replied, \"Yes, sir.\"  The captain saluted Mr. Waters, and then as Alister moved off, he said, \"You're not sick, I see. Have you sailed before?\"  \"From Scotland, sir.\"  Whether, being a Scotchman himself, the tones of Alister's voice, as it lingered on the word \"Scotland,\" touched a soft corner in the captain's soul, or whether the blue eyes met with an involuntary feeling of kinship, or whether the captain was merely struck by Alister's powerful-looking frame, and thought he might be very useful when he was better fed, I do not know; but I feel sure that as he returned my new comrade's salute, he did so in a softened humour. Perhaps this made him doubly rough to me, and I have no doubt I looked as miserable an object as one could (not) wish to see.  \"_You're_ sick enough,\" he said; \"stand straight, sir! we don't nurse invalids here, and if you stop you'll have to work for your food, whether you can eat it or not.\"  \"I will, sir,\" said I.  \"Put out your hands.\"  I did, and he looked keenly, first at them, and then, from head to foot, at me. And then to my horror, he asked the question I had been asked by the man who robbed me of my shilling.  \"Where did you steal your slops?\"  I hastened to explain. \"A working-man, sir, in Liverpool, who was kind enough to advise me, said that I should have no chance of getting work on board ship in the clothes I had on. So I exchanged them, and got these, in a shop he took me to,\" and being anxious to prove the truth of my tale, and also to speak with the utmost respect of everybody in this critical state of my affairs, I added: \"I don't remember the name of the street, sir, but the shop was kept by a--by a Mr. Moses Cohen.\"  \"By Mister--_who_?\"  \"Mr. Moses Cohen, sir.\"  When I first uttered the name, I fancied I heard some sniggering among the sailors who still kept guard over me, and this time the captain's face wrinkled, and he turned to another officer standing near him and repeated,  \"Mister Moses Cohen!\" and they both burst into a fit of laughter, which became a roar among the subordinates, till the captain cried--\"Silence there!\" and still chuckling sardonically, added, \"Your suit must have been a very spic and span one, young gentleman, if _Mister_ Moses Cohen accepted it in lieu of that rig out.\"  \"I paid ten shillings as well,\" said I.  The laughter recommenced, but the captain looked wrathful. \"Oh, you paid ten shillings as well, did you? And what the thunder and lightning have you tried to steal a passage for when you'd money to pay for one?\"  \"I didn't mean to steal a passage, sir,\" said I, \"and I don't mean it now. I tried to get taken as a sailor-lad, but they seemed to expect me to have been to sea before, and to have some papers to show it. So I stowed away, and I'm very sorry if you think it dishonest, sir, but I meant to work for my passage, and I will work hard.\"  \"And what do you suppose an ignorant land-lubber like you can do, as we don't happen to be short of public speakers?\"  \"I thought I could clean things, and carry coals, and do rough work till I learnt my trade, sir.\"  \"Can you climb?\" said the captain, looking at the rigging.  \"I've never climbed on board ship, sir, but I was good at athletics when I was at school, and I believe I could.\"  \"We'll see,\" said the captain significantly. \"And supposing you're of no use, and we kick ye overboard, can ye swim?\"  \"Yes, sir, and dive. I'm at home in the water.\"  \"It's more than you are _on_ it. Bo'sun!\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Take this accomplished young gentleman of fortune, and give him something to do. Give him an oil-rag and let him rub some of our brass, and stow his own. And, bo'sun!\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Take him first to Mr. Johnson, and say that I request Mr. Johnson to ascertain how much change Mister Moses Cohen has left him, and to take charge of it.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The captain's witticisms raised renewed chuckling among the crew, as I followed the boatswain, duly saluting my new master as I passed him, and desperately trying to walk easily and steadily in my ordinary boots upon the heaving deck.  Mr. Johnson was the third mate, and I may as well say at once that his shrewdness and kindness, his untiring energy and constant cheerfulness, make his memory very pleasant to me and to all who served with him, and whose reasons for being grateful to him belong to all hours of the day and night, and to every department of our work and our play.  I was far too giddy to hear what the boatswain said to Mr. Johnson, but I was conscious that the third mate's eyes were scanning me closely as he listened. Then he said, \"_Have_ you got any money, youngster?\"  \"Here, sir,\" said I; and after some struggles I got the leather bag from my neck, and Mr. Johnson pocketed it.  \"Ran away from school, I suppose?\"  I tried to reply, and could not. Excitement had kept me up before the captain, but the stress of it was subsiding, and putting my arms up to get my purse had aggravated the intense nausea that was beginning to overpower me. I managed to shake my head instead of speaking, after which I thought I must have died then and there of the agony across my brow. It seemed probable that I should go far to pay for my passage by the amusement I afforded the crew. Even Mr. Johnson laughed, as he said, \"He seems pretty bad. Look after him, and then let him try his hand on those stanchions--they're disgraceful. Show him how, and see that he lays on--\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  \"And, bo'sun! don't be too rough on him just yet. We've all of us made our first voyage.\"  \"Very true, sir.\"  I could have fallen at the man's feet for those few kind words, but his alert step had carried him far away; and the boatswain had gripped me by the arm, and landed me on a seat, before I could think of how to express my thanks.  \"Stay where ye are, young stowaway,\" said he, \"and I'll fetch the oil and things. But don't fall overboard; for we can't afford to send a hexpedition on a voyage of discovery harter ye.\"  Off went the boatswain, and by the time he came back with a bundle of brass rods under his arm, and an old sardine-tin full of a mixture of oil, vinegar, and sand, and a saturated fragment of a worn-out worsted sock, I had more or less recovered from a violent attack of sickness, and was trying to keep my teeth from being chattered out of my aching head in the fit of shivering that succeeded it.  \"Now, my pea-green beauty!\" said he, \"pull yourself together, and bear a hand with this tackle.
