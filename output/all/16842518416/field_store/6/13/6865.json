Vol. 1 (#7)"],["body","Sir Edward Bruce, in the same bold, careless tone. \"Yet beshrew me, but I think that in these times a sudden blow and hasty fate the only judgment for a traitor. The miscreant were too richly honored, that by thy royal hand he fell.\"  \"My son, my son, I pray thee, peace,\" urged the abbot, in accents of calm, yet grave authority. \"As minister of heaven, I may not list such words. Bend not thy brow in wrath, clad as thou art in mail, in youthful might; yet in my Maker's cause this withered frame is stronger yet than thou art. Enough of that which hath been. Thy sovereign spoke in lowly penitence to me--to me, who frail and lowly unto thee, am yet the minister of Him whom sin offends. To thee he stands a warrior and a king, who rude irreverence may brook not, even from his brother. Be peace between us, then, my son; an old man's blessing on thy fierce yet knightly spirit rest.\"  With a muttered oath Sir Edward had strode away at the abbot's first words, but the cloud passed from his brow as he concluded, and slightly, yet with something of reverence, he bowed his head.  \"And whither didst thou wend thy way, my fiery brother?\" demanded Robert. \"Bringest thou aught of news, or didst thou and Douglas but set foot in stirrup and hand on rein simply from weariness of quiet?\"  \"In sober truth, 'twas even so; partly to mark the movements of the English, an they make a movement, which, till Pembroke come, they are all too much amazed to do; partly to see if in truth that poltroon Duncan of Fife yet hangs back and still persists in forswearing the loyalty of his ancestors, and leaving to better hands the proud task of placing the crown of Scotland on thy head.\"  \"And thou art convinced at last that such and such only is his intention?\" The knight nodded assent, and Bruce continued, jestingly, \"And so thou mightst have been long ago, my sage brother, hadst thou listened to me. I tell thee Earl Duncan hath a spite against me, not for daring to raise the standard of freedom and proclaim myself a king, but for very hatred of myself. Nay, hast thou not seen it thyself, when, fellow-soldiers, fellow-seekers of the banquet, tournay, or ball, he hath avoided, shunned me? and why should he seek me now?\"  \"Why? does not Scotland call him, Scotland bid him gird his sword and don his mail? Will not the dim spectres of his loyal line start from their very tombs to call him to thy side, or brand him traitor and poltroon, with naught of Duff about him but the name? Thou smilest.\"  \"At thy violence, good brother. Duncan of Fife loves better the silken cords of peace and pleasure, e'en though those silken threads hide chains, than the trumpet's voice and weight of mail. In England bred, courted, flattered by her king, 'twere much too sore a trouble to excite his anger and lose his favor; and for whom, for what?--to crown the man he hateth from his soul?\"  \"And knowest thou wherefore, good my son, in what thou hast offended?\"  \"Offended, holy father? Nay, in naught unless perchance a service rendered when a boy--a simple service, merely that of saving life--hath rendered him the touchy fool he is. But hark! who comes?\"  The tramping of many horses, mingled with the eager voices of men, resounded from the courtyard as he spoke, and Sir Edward strode hastily to the casement. \"Sir Robert Keith returned!\" he exclaimed, joyfully; \"and seemingly right well attended. Litters too--bah! we want no more women. 'Tis somewhat new for Keith to be a squire of dames. Why, what banner is this? The black bear of Buchan--impossible! the earl is a foul Comyn. I'll to the court, for this passes my poor wits.\" He turned hastily to quit the chamber, as a youth entered, not without some opposition, it appeared, from the attendants without, but eagerly he had burst through them, and flung his plumed helmet from his beautiful brow, and, after glancing hastily round the room, bounded to the side of Robert, knelt at his feet, and clasped his knees without uttering a syllable, voiceless from an emotion whose index was stamped upon his glowing features.  \"Nigel, by all that's marvellous, and as moon-stricken as his wont! Why, where the foul fiend hast thou sprung from? Art dumb, thou foolish boy? By St. Andrew, these are times to act and speak, not think and feel! Whence comest thou?\"  So spoke the impatient Edward, to whom the character of his youngest brother had ever been a riddle, which it had been too much trouble to expound, and that which it _seemed_ to his too careless thought he ever looked upon with scorn and contempt. Not so, King Robert; he raised him affectionately in his arms, and pressed him to his heart.  \"Thou'rt welcome, most, most welcome, Nigel; as welcome as unlooked for. But why this quick return from scenes and studies more congenial to thy gentle nature, my young brother? this fettered land is scarce a home for thee; thy free, thy fond imaginings can scarce have resting here.\" He spoke sadly, and his smile unwittingly was sorrowful.  \"And thinkest thou, Robert--nay, forgive me, good my liege--thinkest thou, because I loved the poet's dream, because I turned, in sad and lonely musing, from King Edward's court, I loved the cloister better than the camp? Oh, do me not such wrong! thou knowest not the guidings of my heart; nor needs it now, my sword shall better plead my cause than can my tongue.\" He turned away deeply and evidently pained, and a half laugh from Sir Edward prevented the king's reply.  \"Well crowed, my pretty fledgling,\" he said, half jesting, half in scorn. \"But knowest thou, to fight in very earnest is something different than to read and chant it in a minstrel's lay? Better hie thee back to Florence, boy; the mail suit and crested helm are not for such as thee--better shun them now, than after they are donned.\"  \"How! darest thou, Edward? Edward, tempt me not too far,\" exclaimed Nigel, his cheek flushing, and springing towards him, his hand upon his half-drawn sword. \"By heaven, wert thou not my mother's son, I would compel thee to retract these words, injurious, unjust! How darest thou judge me coward, till my cowardice is proved? Thy blood is not more red than mine.\"  \"Peace, peace! what meaneth this unseemly broil?\" said Robert, hastily advancing between them, for the dark features of Edward were lowering in wrath, and Nigel was excited to unwonted fierceness. \"Edward, begone! and as thou saidst, see to Sir Robert Keith--what news he brings. Nigel, on thy love, thy allegiance so lately proffered, if I read thy greeting right, I pray thee heed not his taunting words. I do not doubt thee; 'twas for thy happiness, not for thy gallantry, I trembled. Look not thus dejected;\" he held out his hand, which his brother knelt to salute. \"Nay, nay, thou foolish boy, forget my new dignity a while, and now that rude brawler has departed, tell me in sober wisdom, how camest thou here? How didst thou know I might have need of thee?\" A quick blush suffused the cheek of the young man; he hesitated, evidently confused. \"Why, what ails thee, boy? By St. Andrew, Nigel, I do believe thou hast never quitted Scotland.\"  \"And if I have not, my lord, what wilt thou deem me?\"  \"A very strangely wayward boy, not knowing his own mind,\" replied the king, smiling. \"Yet why should I say so? I never asked thy confidence, never sought it, or in any way returned or appreciated thy boyish love, and why should I deem thee wayward, never inquiring into thy projects--passing thee by, perchance, as a wild visionary, much happier than myself?\"  \"And thou wilt think me yet more a visionary, I fear me, Robert; yet thine interest is too dear to pass unanswered,\" rejoined Nigel, after glancing round and perceiving they were alone, for the abbot had departed with Sir Edward, seeking to tame his reckless spirit.  \"Know, then, to aid me in keeping aloof from the tyrant of my country, whom instinctively I hated, I confined myself to books and such lore yet more than my natural inclination prompted, though that was strong enough--I had made a solemn vow, rather to take the monk's cowl and frock, than receive knighthood from the hand of Edward of England, or raise my sword at his bidding. My whole soul yearned towards the country of my fathers, that country which was theirs by royal right; and when the renown of Wallace reached my ears, when, in my waking and sleeping dreams, I beheld the patriot struggling for freedom, peace, the only one whose arm had struck for Scotland, whose tongue had dared to speak resistance, I longed wildly, intensely, vainly, to burst the thraldom which held my race, and seek for death beneath the patriot banner. I longed, yet dared not. My own death were welcome; but mother, father, brothers, sisters, all were perilled, had I done so. I stood, I deemed, alone in my enthusiast dreams; those I loved best, acknowledged, bowed before the man my very spirit loathed; and how dared I, a boy, a child, stand forth arraigning and condemning? But wherefore art thou thus, Robert? oh, what has thus moved thee?\"  Wrapped in his own earnest words and thoughts, Nigel had failed until that moment to perceive the effect of his words upon his brother. Robert's head had sunk upon his hand, and his whole frame shook beneath some strong emotion; evidently striving to subdue it, some moments elapsed ere he could reply, and then only in accents of bitter self-reproach. \"Why, why did not such thoughts come to me, instead of thee?\" he said. \"My youth had not wasted then in idle folly--worse, oh, worse--in slavish homage, coward indecision, flitting like the moth around the destructive flame; and while I deemed thee buried in romantic dreams, all a patriot's blood was rushing in thy veins, while mine was dull and stagnant.\"  \"But to flow forth the brighter, my own brother,\" interrupted Nigel, earnestly. \"Oh, I have watched thee, studied thee, even as I loved thee, long; and I have hoped, felt, _known_ that this day would dawn; that thou _wouldst_ rise for Scotland, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18387"],["title","The Days of Bruce: A Story from Scottish History. Vol. 1 (#8)"],["body","would rise for thee. Ah, now thou smilest as thyself, and I will to my tale. The patriot died--let me not utter how; no Scottish tongue should speak those words, save with the upraised arm and trumpet shout of vengeance! I could not rest in England then; I could not face the tyrant who dared proclaim and execute as traitor the noblest hero, purest patriot, that ever walked this earth. But men said I sought the lyric schools, the poet's haunts in Provence, and I welcomed the delusion; but it was to Scotland that I came, unknown, and silently, to mark if with her Wallace all life and soul had fled. I saw enough to know that were there but a fitting head, her hardy sons would struggle yet for freedom--but not yet; that chief art thou, and at the close of the last year I took passage to Denmark, intending to rest there till Scotland called me.\"  \"And 'tis thence thou comest, Nigel? Can it be, intelligence of my movements hath reached so far north already?\" inquired the king, somewhat surprised at the abruptness of his brother's pause.  \"Not so, my liege. The vessel which bore me was wrecked off the breakers of Buchan, and cast me back again to the arms of Scotland. I found hospitality, shelter, kindness; nay more, were this a time and place to speak of happy, trusting love--\" he added, turning away from the Bruce's penetrating eye, \"and week after week passed, and found me still an inmate of the Tower of Buchan.\"  \"Buchan!\" interrupted the king, hastily; \"the castle of a Comyn, and thou speakest of love!\"  \"Of as true, as firm-hearted a Scottish patriot, my liege, as ever lived in the heart of woman--one that has naught of Comyn about her or her fair children but the name, as speedily thou wilt have proof. But in good time is my tale come to a close, for hither comes good Sir Robert, and other noble knights, who, by their eager brows, methinks, have matters of graver import for thy grace's ear.\"  They entered as he spoke. The patriot nobles who, at the first call of their rightful king, had gathered round his person, few in number, yet firm in heart, ready to lay down fame, fortune, life, beside his standard, rather than acknowledge the foreign foe, who, setting aside all principles of knightly honor, knightly faith, sought to claim their country as his own, their persons as his slaves. Eager was the greeting of each and all to the youthful Nigel, mingled with some surprise. Their conference with the king was but brief, and as it comprised matters more of speculation than of decided import, we will pass on to a later period of the same evening.     CHAPTER IV.   \"Buchan! the Countess of Buchan, sayest thou, Athelbert? nay, 'tis scarce possible,\" said a fair and noble-looking woman, still in the bloom of life, though early youth had passed, pausing on her way to the queen's apartment, to answer some information given by the senior page.  \"Indeed, madam, 'tis even so; she arrived but now, escorted by Sir Robert Keith and his followers, in addition to some fifty of the retainers of Buchan.\"  \"And hath she lodging within the palace?\"  \"Yes, madam; an it please you, I will conduct you to her, 'tis but a step beyond the royal suite.\"  She made him a sign of assent, and followed him slowly, as if musingly.  \"It is strange, it is very strange,\" she thought, \"yet scarcely so; she was ever in heart and soul a patriot, nor has she seen enough of her husband to change such sentiments. Yet, for her own sake, perchance it had been better had she not taken this rash step; 'tis a desperate game we play, and the fewer lives and fortunes wrecked the better.\"  Her cogitations were interrupted by hearing her name announced in a loud voice by the page, and finding herself in presence of the object of her thoughts.  \"Isabella, dearest Isabella, 'tis even thine own dear self. I deemed the boy's tale well-nigh impossible,\" was her hasty exclamation, as with a much quicker step she advanced towards the countess, who met her half-way, and warmly returned her embrace, saying as she did so--  \"This is kind, indeed, dearest Mary, to welcome me so soon; 'tis long, long years since we have met; but they have left as faint a shadow on thy affections as on mine.\"  \"Indeed, thou judgest me truly, Isabella. Sorrow, methinks, doth but soften the heart and render the memory of young affections, youthful pleasures, the more vivid, the more lasting: we think of what we have been, or what we are, and the contrast heightens into perfect bliss that which at the time, perchance, we deemed but perishable joy.\"  \"Hast thou too learnt such lesson, Mary? I hoped its lore was all unknown to thee.\"  \"It was, indeed, deferred so long, so blessedly, I dared to picture perfect happiness on earth; but since my husband's hateful captivity, Isabella, there can be little for his wife but anxiety and dread. But these--are these thine?\" she added, gazing admiringly and tearfully on Agnes and Alan, who had at their mother's sign advanced from the embrasure, where they had held low yet earnest converse, and gracefully acknowledged the stranger's notice. \"Oh, wherefore bring them here, my friend?\"  \"Wherefore, lady?\" readily and impetuously answered Alan; \"art thou a friend of Isabella of Buchan, and asketh wherefore? Where our sovereign is, should not his subjects be?\"  \"Thy mother's friend and sovereign's sister, noble boy, and yet I grieve to see thee here. The Bruce is but in name a king, uncrowned as yet and unanointed. His kingdom bounded by the confines of this one fair county, struggling for every acre at the bright sword's point.\"  \"The greater glory for his subjects, lady,\" answered the youth. \"The very act of proclaiming himself king removes the chains of Scotland, and flings down her gage. Fear not, he shall be king ere long in something more than name.\"  \"And is it thus a Comyn speaks?\" said the Lady Campbell. \"Ah, were the idle feuds of petty minds thus laid at rest, bold boy, thy dreams might e'en be truth; but knowest thou, young man--knowest thou, Isabella, the breach between the Comyn and the Bruce is widened, and, alas! by blood?\"  \"Aye, lady; but what boots it? A traitor should have no name, no kin, or those who bear that name should wash away their race's stain by nobler deeds of loyalty and valor.\"  \"It would be well did others think with thee,\" replied Lady Campbell; \"yet I fear me in such sentiments the grandson of the loyal Fife will stand alone. Isabella, dearest Isabella,\" she added, laying her hand on the arm of the countess, and drawing her away from her children, \"hast thou done well in this decision? hast thou listened to the calmer voice of prudence as was thy wont? hast thou thought on all the evils thou mayest draw upon thy head, and upon these, so lovely and so dear?\"  \"Mary, I have thought, weighed, pondered, and yet I am here,\" answered the countess, firmly, yet in an accent that still bespoke some inward struggle. \"I know, I feel all, all that thou wouldst urge; that I am exposing my brave boy to death, perchance, by a father's hand, bringing him hither to swear fealty, to raise his sword for the Bruce, in direct opposition to my husband's politics, still more to his will; yet, Mary, there are mutual duties between a parent and a child. My poor boy has ever from his birth been fatherless. No kindly word, no glowing smile has ever met his infancy, his boyhood. He scarce can know his father--the love, the reverence of a son it would have been such joy to teach. Left to my sole care, could I instil sentiments other than those a father's lips bestowed on me? Could I instruct him in aught save love, devotion to his country, to her rights, her king? I have done this so gradually, my friend, that for the burst of loyalty, of impetuous gallantry, which answered Sir Robert Keith's appeal, I was well nigh unprepared. My father, my noble father breathes in my boy; and oh, Mary, better, better far lose him on the battle-field, struggling for Scotland's freedom, glorying in his fate, rejoicing, blessing me for lessons I have taught, than see him as my husband, as my brother--alas! alas! that I should live to say it--cringing as slaves before the footstool of a tyrant and oppressor. Had he sought it, had he loved--treated me as a wife, Mary, I would have given my husband all--all a woman's duty--all, save the dictates of my soul, but even this he trampled on, despised, rejected; and shall I, dare I then forget, oppose the precepts of that noble heart, that patriot spirit which breathed into mine the faint reflection of itself?--offend the dead, the hallowed dead, my father--the heart that loved me?\"  She paused, in strong, and for the moment overpowering, emotion. The clear, rich tones had never faltered till she spoke of him beloved even in death--faltered not, even when she spoke of death as the portion of her child; it was but the quivering of lip and eye by which the anguish of that thought could have been ascertained. Lady Campbell clasped her hand.  \"Thou hast in very truth silenced me, my Isabella,\" she said; \"there is no combating with thoughts as these. Thine is still the same noble soul, exalted mind that I knew in youth: sorrow and time have had no power on these.\"  \"Save to chasten and to purify, I trust,\" rejoined the countess, in her own calm tone. \"Thrown back upon my own strength, it must have gathered force, dear Mary, or have perished altogether. But thou speakest, methinks, but too despondingly of our sovereign's prospects--are they indeed so desperate?\"  \"Desperate, indeed, Isabella. Even his own family, with the sole exception of that rash madman, Edward, must look upon it thus. How thinkest thou Edward of England will brook this daring act of defiance, of what he will deem rank apostasy and traitorous rebellion? Aged, infirm as he is now, he will not permit this bold attempt to pass unpunished. The whole strength of England will be gathered together, and pour its devastating fury on this devoted land. And what to this has"]]]
