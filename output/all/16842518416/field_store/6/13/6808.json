Que n'en pensas, canèu de sort!        --O rammaissaire de dardeno        Det croucu, boumbudo bedeno   Que gouvernas lou mounde emé lou coffre-fort,         Fasès courre lou bru, canaio,        Que l'artisto jamai travaio        E dèu pati, lou bedigas.        Teisas-vous dounc: quand di lambrusco        La Cigalo a cava la rusco,   Raubas soun bèure, e pièi, morto, la rousigas.  So speaks my friend in the expressive Provençal idiom, rehabilitating the creature so libelled by the fabulist.  Translated with a little necessary freedom, the English of it is as follows:--                    I.    Fine weather for the Cigale! God, what heat!      Half drunken with her joy, she feasts   In a hail of fire. Pays for the harvest meet;      A golden sea the reaper breasts,   Loins bent, throat bare; silent, he labours long,   For thirst within his throat has stilled the song.    A blessed time for thee, little Cigale.      Thy little cymbals shake and sound,   Shake, shake thy stomach till thy mirrors fall!      Man meanwhile swings his scythe around;   Continually back and forth it veers,   Flashing its steel amidst the ruddy ears.    Grass-plugged, with water for the grinder full,     A flask is hung upon his hip;   The stone within its wooden trough is cool,     Free all the day to sip and sip;   But man is gasping in the fiery sun,   That makes his very marrow melt and run.    Thou, Cigale, hast a cure for thirst: the bark,     Tender and juicy, of the bough.   Thy beak, a very needle, stabs it. Mark     The narrow passage welling now;   The sugared stream is flowing, thee beside,   Who drinkest of the flood, the honeyed tide.    Not in peace always; nay, for thieves arrive,     Neighbours and wives, or wanderers vile;   They saw thee sink the well, and ill they thrive     Thirsting; they seek to drink awhile;   Beauty, beware! the wallet-snatcher's face,   Humble at first, grows insolent apace.    They seek the merest drop; thy leavings take;     Soon discontent, their heads they toss;   They crave for all, and all will have. They rake     Their claws thy folded wings across;   Thy back a mountain, up and down each goes;   They seize thee by the beak, the horns, the toes.    This way and that they pull. Impatient thou:     Pst! Pst! a jet of nauseous taste   O'er the assembly sprinklest. Leave the bough     And fly the rascals thus disgraced,   Who stole thy well, and with malicious pleasure   Now lick their honey'd lips, and feed at leisure.    See these Bohemians without labour fed!     The ant the worst of all the crew--   Fly, drone, wasp, beetle too with horned head,     All of them sharpers thro' and thro',   Idlers the sun drew to thy well apace--   None more than she was eager for thy place,    More apt thy face to tickle, toe to tread,     Or nose to pinch, and then to run   Under the shade thine ample belly spread;     Or climb thy leg for ladder; sun   Herself audacious on thy wings, and go   Most insolently o'er thee to and fro.                     II.    Now comes a tale that no one should believe.     In other times, the ancients say,   The winter came, and hunger made thee grieve.     Thou didst in secret see one day   The ant below the ground her treasure store away.    The wealthy ant was drying in the sun     Her corn the dew had wet by night,   Ere storing it again; and one by one     She filled her sacks as it dried aright.   Thou camest then, and tears bedimmed thy sight,    Saying: \"'Tis very cold; the bitter bise     Blows me this way and that to-day.   I die of hunger. Of your riches please     Fill me my bag, and I'll repay,   When summer and its melons come this way.    \"Lend me a little corn.\" Go to, go to!     Think you the ant will lend an ear?   You are deceived. Great sacks, but nought for you!     \"Be off, and scrape some barrel clear!   You sing of summer: starve, for winter's here!\"    'Tis thus the ancient fable sings     To teach us all the prudence ripe   Of farthing-snatchers, glad to knot the string     That tie their purses. May the gripe   Of colic twist the guts of all such tripe!    He angers me, this fable-teller does,     Saying in winter thou dost seek   Flies, grubs, corn--thou dost never eat like us!     --Corn! Couldst thou eat it, with thy beak?   Thou hast thy fountain with its honey'd reek.    To thee what matters winter? Underground     Slumber thy children, sheltered; thou   The sleep that knows no waking sleepest sound.     Thy body, fallen from the bough,   Crumbles; the questing ant has found thee now.    The wicked ant of thy poor withered hide     A banquet makes; in little bits   She cuts thee up, and empties thine inside,     And stores thee where in wealth she sits:   Choice diet when the winter numbs the wits.                    III.    Here is the tale related duly,   And little resembling the fable, truly!   Hoarders of farthings, I know, deuce take it.   It isn't the story as you would make it!   Crook-fingers, big-bellies, what do you say,   Who govern the world with the cash-box--hey?    You have spread the story, with shrug and smirk,   That the artist ne'er does a stroke of work;   And so let him suffer, the imbecile!   Be you silent! 'Tis you, I think,   When the Cigale pierces the vine to drink,   Drive her away, her drink to steal;   And when she is dead--you make your meal!     CHAPTER II  THE CIGALE LEAVES ITS BURROW   The first Cigales appear about the summer solstice. Along the beaten paths, calcined by the sun, hardened by the passage of frequent feet, we see little circular orifices almost large enough to admit the thumb. These are the holes by which the larvæ of the Cigale have come up from the depths to undergo metamorphosis. We see them more or less everywhere, except in fields where the soil has been disturbed by ploughing. Their usual position is in the driest and hottest situations,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],["title","Social Life in the Insect World (#3)"],["body","by the sides of roads or the borders of footpaths. Powerfully equipped for the purpose, able at need to pierce the turf or sun-dried clay, the larva, upon leaving the earth, seems to prefer the hardest spots.  A garden alley, converted into a little Arabia Petræa by reflection from a wall facing the south, abounds in such holes. During the last days of June I have made an examination of these recently abandoned pits. The soil is so compact that I needed a pick to tackle it.  The orifices are round, and close upon an inch in diameter. There is absolutely no debris round them; no earth thrown up from within. This is always the case; the holes of the Cigales are never surrounded by dumping-heaps, as are the burrows of the Geotrupes, another notable excavator. The way in which the work is done is responsible for this difference. The dung-beetle works from without inwards; she begins to dig at the mouth of the burrow, and afterwards re-ascends and accumulates the excavated material on the surface. The larva of the Cigale, on the contrary, works outward from within, upward from below; it opens the door of exit at the last moment, so that it is not free for the discharge of excavated material until the work is done. The first enters and raises a little rubbish-heap at the threshold of her burrow; the second emerges, and cannot, while working, pile up its rubbish on a threshold which as yet has no existence.  The burrow of the Cigale descends about fifteen inches. It is cylindrical, slightly twisted, according to the exigencies of the soil, and always approaches the vertical, or the direction of the shortest passage. It is perfectly free along its entire length. We shall search in vain for the rubbish which such an excavation must apparently produce; we shall find nothing of the sort. The burrow terminates in a cul-de-sac, in a fairly roomy chamber with unbroken walls, which shows not the least vestige of communication with any other burrow or prolongation of the shaft.  Taking its length and diameter into account, we find the excavation has a total volume of about twelve cubic inches. What becomes of the earth which is removed?  Sunk in a very dry, crumbling soil, we should expect the shaft and the chamber at the bottom to have soft, powdery walls, subject to petty landslips, if no work were done but that of excavation. On the contrary, the walls are neatly daubed, plastered with a sort of clay-like mortar. They are not precisely smooth, indeed they are distinctly rough; but their irregularities are covered with a layer of plaster, and the crumbling material, soaked in some glutinous liquid and dried, is held firmly in place.  The larva can climb up and down, ascend nearly to the surface, and go down into its chamber of refuge, without bringing down, with his claws, the continual falls of material which would block the burrow, make ascent a matter of difficulty, and retreat impossible. The miner shores up his galleries with uprights and cross-timbers; the builder of underground railways supports the sides and roofs of his tunnels with a lining of brick or masonry or segments of iron tube; the larva of the Cigale, no less prudent an engineer, plasters the walls of its burrow with cement, so that the passage is always free and ready for use.  If I surprise the creature just as it is emerging from the soil in order to gain a neighbouring bough and there undergo transformation, I see it immediately make a prudent retreat, descending to the bottom of its burrow without the slightest difficulty--a proof that even when about to be abandoned for ever the refuge is not encumbered with rubbish.  The ascending shaft is not a hurried piece of work, scamped by a creature impatient to reach the sunlight. It is a true dwelling, in which the larva may make a long stay. The plastered walls betray as much. Such precautions would be useless in the case of a simple exit abandoned as soon as made. We cannot doubt that the burrow is a kind of meteorological observatory, and that its inhabitant takes note of the weather without. Buried underground at a depth of twelve or fifteen inches, the larva, when ripe for escape, could hardly judge whether the meteorological conditions were favourable. The subterranean climate varies too little, changes too slowly, and would not afford it the precise information required for the most important action of its life--the escape into the sunshine at the time of metamorphosis.  Patiently, for weeks, perhaps for months, it digs, clears, and strengthens a vertical shaft, leaving only a layer of earth a finger's breadth in thickness to isolate it from the outer world. At the bottom it prepares a carefully built recess. This is its refuge, its place of waiting, where it reposes in peace if its observations decide it to postpone its final departure. At the least sign of fine weather it climbs to the top of its burrow, sounds the outer world through the thin layer of earth which covers the shaft, and informs itself of the temperature and humidity of the outer air.  If things are not going well--if there are threats of a flood or the dreaded _bise_--events of mortal gravity when the delicate insect issues from its cerements--the prudent creature re-descends to the bottom of its burrow for a longer wait. If, on the contrary, the state of the atmosphere is favourable, the roof is broken through by a few strokes of its claws, and the larva emerges from its tunnel.  Everything seems to prove that the burrow of the Cigale is a waiting-room, a meteorological station, in which the larva makes a prolonged stay; sometimes hoisting itself to the neighbourhood of the surface in order to ascertain the external climate; sometimes retiring to the depths the better to shelter itself. This explains the chamber at the base of the shaft, and the necessity of a cement to hold the walls together, for otherwise the creature's continual comings and goings would result in a landslip.  A matter less easy of explanation is the complete disappearance of the material which originally filled the excavated space. Where are the twelve cubic inches of earth that represent the average volume of the original contents of the shaft? There is not a trace of this material outside, nor inside either. And how, in a soil as dry as a cinder, is the plaster made with which the walls are covered?  Larvæ which burrow in wood, such as those of Capricornis and Buprestes, will apparently answer our first question. They make their way through the substance of a tree-trunk, boring their galleries by the simple method of eating the material in front of them. Detached by their mandibles, fragment by fragment, the material is digested. It passes from end to end through the body of the pioneer, yields during its passage its meagre nutritive principles, and accumulates behind it, obstructing the passage, by which the larva will never return. The work of extreme division, effected partly by the mandibles and partly by the stomach, makes the digested material more compact than the intact wood, from which it follows that there is always a little free space at the head of the gallery, in which the caterpillar works and lives; it is not of any great length, but just suffices for the movements of the prisoner.  Must not the larva of the Cigale bore its passage in some such fashion? I do not mean that the results of excavation pass through its body--for earth, even the softest mould, could form no possible part of its diet. But is not the material detached simply thrust back behind the excavator as the work progresses?  The Cigale passes four years under ground. This long life is not spent, of course, at the bottom of the well I have just described; that is merely a resting-place preparatory to its appearance on the face of the earth. The larva comes from elsewhere; doubtless from a considerable distance. It is a vagabond, roaming from one root to another and implanting its rostrum. When it moves, either to flee from the upper layers of the soil, which in winter become too cold, or to install itself upon a more juicy root, it makes a road by rejecting behind it the material broken up by the teeth of its picks. That this is its method is incontestable.  As with the larvæ of Capricornis and Buprestes, it is enough for the traveller to have around it the small amount of free space necessitated by its movements. Moist, soft, and easily compressible soil is to the larva of the Cigale what digested wood-pulp is to the others. It is compressed without difficulty, and so leaves a vacant space.  The difficulty is that sometimes the burrow of exit from the waiting-place is driven through a very arid soil, which is extremely refractory to compression so long as it retains its aridity. That the larva, when commencing the excavation of its burrow, has already thrust part of the detached material into a previously made gallery, now filled up and disappeared, is probable enough, although nothing in the actual condition of things goes to support the theory; but if we consider the capacity of the shaft and the extreme difficulty of making room for such a volume of debris, we feel dubious once more; for to hide such a quantity of earth a considerable empty space would be necessary, which could only be obtained by the disposal of more debris. Thus we are caught in a vicious circle. The mere packing of the powdered earth rejected behind the excavator would not account for so large a void. The Cigale must have a special method of disposing of the waste earth. Let us see if we can discover the secret.  Let us examine a larva at the moment of emerging from the soil. It is almost always more or less smeared with mud, sometimes dried, sometimes moist. The implements of excavation, the claws of the fore-feet, have their points covered by little globules of mortar; the others bear leggings of mud; the back is spotted with clay. One is reminded of a scavenger who has been scooping up mud all"]]]
