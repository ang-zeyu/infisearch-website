He could remember, clearly enough, the sale of the slaves, but after that--Oh, well, he'd been drinking; it would all come back to him, after a while.         *       *       *       *       *  Verkan Vall rubbed his hand over his face wearily, started to light another cigarette, and threw it across the room in disgust. What he needed was a drink--a long drink of cool, tart white wine, laced with brandy--and then he needed to sleep.  \"We're absolutely nowhere!\" Ranthar Jard said. \"Of course they're operating on time lines we've never penetrated. The fact that they're supplying the Croutha with guns proves that; there isn't a firearm on any of the time lines our people are legitimately exploiting. And there are only about three billion time lines on this belt of the Croutha invasion--\"  \"If we could think of a way to reduce it to some specific area of paratime--\" one of Ranthar Jard's deputies began.  \"That's precisely what we've been trying to do, Klav,\" Vall said. \"We haven't done it.\"  Dalla, who had withdrawn from the discussion and was on a couch at the side of the room, surrounded by reports and abstracts and summaries, looked up.  \"I took hours and hours of hypno-mech on Kholghoor Sector religions, before I went out on that wild-goose chase for psychokinesis and precognition data,\" she said. \"About six or eight hundred years ago, there were religious wars and heresies and religious schisms all over the Kharanda country. No matter how uniform the Kholghoor Sector may be otherwise, there are dozens and dozens of small belts and sub-sectors of different religions or sects or god-cults.\"  \"That's right,\" Ranthar Jard agreed, brightening. \"We have hagiologists who know all that stuff; we'll have a couple of them interrogate those slaves. I don't know how much they can get out of them--lot of peasants, won't be up on the theological niceties--but a synthesis of what we get from the lot of them--\"  \"That's an idea,\" Vall agreed. \"About the first idea we've had, here--Oh, how about politics, too? Check on who's the king, what the stories about the royal family are, that sort of thing.\"  Ranthar Jard looked at the map on the wall. \"The Croutha have only gotten halfway to Nharkan, here. Say we transpose detectives in at night on some of these time lines we think are promising, and check up at the tax-collection offices on a big landowner north of Jhirda named Ghromdour? That might get us something.\"  \"Well, I don't want you to think we're trying to get out of work, Chief's Assistant,\" one of the deputies said, \"but is there any real necessity for our trying to locate the Wizard Trader time lines? If you can get them from the Esaron Sector, it'll be the same, won't it?\"  \"Marv, in this business you never depend on just one lead,\" Ranthar Jard told him. \"And beside, when Skordran Kirv's gang hits the base of operations in North America, there's no guarantee that they may not have time to send off a radio warning to the crowd at the base here in India. We have to hit both places at once.\"  \"Well, that, too,\" Vall said. \"But the main thing is to get these Wizard Trader camps on the Kholghoor Sector cleaned out. How are you fixed for men and equipment, for a big raid, Jard?\"  Ranthar Jard shrugged. \"I can get about five hundred men with conveyers, including a couple of two-hundred-footers to carry airboats,\" he said.  \"Not enough. Skordran Kirv has one complete armored brigade, one airborne infantry brigade, and an air cavalry regiment, with Ghaldron-Hesthor equipment for a simultaneous transposition,\" Vall said.  \"Where in blazes did he get them all?\" Ranthar Jard demanded.  \"They're guard troops, from Service Sector and Industrial Sector. We'll get you the same sort of a force. I only hope we don't have another Prole insurrection while they're away--\"  \"Well, don't think I'm trying to argue policy with you,\" Ranthar Jard said, \"but that could raise a dreadful stink on Home Time Line. Especially on top of this news-break about the slave trade.\"  \"We'll have to take a chance on that,\" Vall said. \"If you're worried about what the book says, forget it. We're throwing the book away, on this operation. Do you realize that this thing is a threat to the whole Paratime Civilization?\"  \"Of course I do,\" Ranthar Jard said. \"I know the doctrine of Paratime Security as well as you or anybody else. The question is, does the public realize it?\"  A buzzer sounded. Ranthar Jard pressed a switch on the intercom-box in front of him and said: \"Ranthar here. Well?\"  \"Visiphone call, top urgency, just came in for Chief's Assistant Verkan, from Novilan Equivalent. Where can I put it through, sir?\"  \"Here; booth seven.\" Ranthar Jard pointed across the room, nodding to Vall. \"In just a moment.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gathon Dard and Antrath Alv--temporary local aliases, Ganadara and Atarazola--sat relaxed in their saddles, swaying to the motion of their horses. They wore the rust-brown hooded cloaks of the northern Jeseru people, in sober contrast to the red and yellow and blue striped robes and sun-bonnets of the Caleras in whose company they rode. They carried short repeating carbines in saddle scabbards, and heavy revolvers and long knives on their belts, and each led six heavily-laden pack-horses.  Coru-hin-Irigod, riding beside Ganadara, pointed up the trail ahead.  \"From up there,\" he said, speaking in Acalan, the lingua franca of the North American West Coast on that sector, \"we can see across the valley to Careba. It will be an hour, as we ride, with the pack-horses. Then we will rest, and drink wine, and feast.\"  Ganadara nodded. \"It was the guidance of our gods--and yours, Coru-hin-Irigod--that we met. Such slaves as you sold at the outlanders' plantation would bring a fine price in the North. The men are strong, and have the look of good field-workers; the women are comely and well-formed. Though I fear that my wife would little relish it did I bring home such handmaidens.\"  Coru-hin-Irigod laughed. \"For your wife, I will give you one of our riding whips.\" He leaned to the side, slashing at a cactus with his quirt. \"We in Careba have no trouble with our wives, about handmaidens or anything else.\"  \"By Safar, if you doubt your welcome at Careba, wait till you show your wares,\" another Calera said. \"Rifles and revolvers like those come to our country seldom, and then old and battered, sold or stolen many times before we see them. Rifles that fire seven times without taking butt from shoulder!\" He invoked the name of the Great Lord Safar again.  The trail widened and leveled; they all came up abreast, with the pack-horses strung out behind, and sat looking across the valley to the adobe walls of the town that perched on the opposite ridge. After a while, riders began dismounting and checking and tightening saddle-girths; a couple of Caleras helped Ganadara and Atarazola inspect their pack-horses. When they remounted, Atarazola bowed his head, lifting his left sleeve to cover his mouth, and muttered into it at some length. The Caleras looked at him curiously, and Coru-hin-Irigod inquired of Ganadara what he did.  \"He prays,\" Ganadara said. \"He thanks our gods that we have lived to see your town, and asks that we be spared to bring many more trains of rifles and ammunition up this trail.\"  The slaver nodded understandingly. The Caleras were a pious people, too, who believed in keeping on friendly terms with the gods.  \"May Safar's hand work with the hands of your gods for it,\" he said, making what, to a non-Calera, would have been an extremely ribald sign.  \"The gods watch over us,\" Atarazola said, lifting his head. \"They are near us even now; they have spoken words of comfort in my ear.\"'  Ganadara nodded. The gods to whom his partner prayed were a couple of paratime policemen, crouching over a radio a mile or so down the ridge.  \"My brother,\" he told Coru-hin-Irigod, \"is much favored by our gods. Many people come to him to pray for them.\"  \"Yes. So you told me, now that I think on it.\" That detail had been included in the pseudo-memories he had been given under hypnosis. \"I serve Safar, as do all Caleras, but I have heard that the Jeserus' gods are good gods, dealing honestly with their servants.\"         *       *       *       *       *  An hour later, under the walls of the town, Coru-hin-Irigod drew one of his pistols and fired all four barrels in rapid succession into the air, shouting, \"Open! Open for Coru-hin-Irigod, and for the Jeseru traders, Ganadara and Atarazola, who are with him!\"  A head, black-bearded and sun-bonneted, appeared between the brick merlons of the wall above the gate, shouted down a welcome, and then turned away to bawl orders. The gate slid aside, and, after the caravan had passed through, naked slaves pushed the massive thing shut again. Although they were familiar with the interior of the town, from photographs taken with boomerang-balls--automatic-return transposition spheres like message-balls--they looked around curiously. The central square was thronged--Caleras in striped robes, people from the south and east in baggy trousers and embroidered shirts, mountaineers in deerskins. A slave market was in progress, and some hundred-odd items of human merchandise were assembled in little groups, guarded by their owners and inspected by prospective buyers. They seemed to be all natives of that geographic and paratemporal area.  \"Don't even look at those,\" Coru-hin-Irigod advised. \"They are but culls; the market is almost over. We'll go to the house of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, where all the considerable men gather, and you will find those who will be able to trade slaves worthy of the goods you have with you. Meanwhile, let my people take your horses and packs to my house; you shall be my guests while you stay in Careba.\"  It was perfectly safe to trust Coru-hin-Irigod. He was a murderer and a brigand and a slaver, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18155"],["title","The Story of the Three Little Pigs (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original lovely illustrations.

THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS  With Drawings by L. Leslie Brooke        [Illustration]     THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.   Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, \"Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house\"; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  To which the Pig answered, \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"  [Illustration]  \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!\" said the Wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little Pig.  The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, \"Please, Man, give me that furze to build a house\"; which the Man did, and the Pig built his house.  [Illustration]  Then along came the Wolf and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"  \"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!\" So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.  [Illustration]  The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, \"Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with\"; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.\"  \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"  \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"  Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, \"Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"Where?\" said the little Pig.  \"Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.\"  \"Very well,\" said the little Pig, \"I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?\"  \"Oh, at six o'clock.\"  [Illustration]  Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, \"Little Pig, are you ready?\"  \"Ready!\" said the little Pig, \"I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be _up to_ the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, \"Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.\"  \"Where?\" said the Pig.  \"Down at Merry-garden,\" replied the Wolf; \"and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples.\"  [Illustration]  Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, \"Little Pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?\"  [Illustration]  \"Yes, very,\" said the little Pig; \"I will throw you down one.\" And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, \"Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said the Pig, \"I will go; what time shall you be ready?\"  \"At three,\" said the Wolf.  [Illustration]  So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.  Then the little Pig said, \"Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.\"  [Illustration]  Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.  [Illustration]  When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after.
