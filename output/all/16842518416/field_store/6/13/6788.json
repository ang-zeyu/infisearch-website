Yet, shall a king hear murder when a king's mouth blessing saith?     So maybe he is bidding me honour, and maybe he is bidding me death:     Let him do after his fashion, and I will do no less.     In peace will I go to his bidding let the spae-wrights ban or bless;     And no man now or hereafter of Volsung's blenching shall tell.     But ye, sons, in the land shall tarry, and heed the realm right well,     Lest the Volsung Children fade, and the wide world worser grow.\"      But with one voice cried all men, that they one and all would go     To gather the Goth-king's honour, or let one fate go over all     If he bade them to battle and murder, till each by each should fall.     So spake the sons of his body, and the wise in wisdom and war.     Nor yet might it otherwise be, though Volsung bade full sore     That he go in some ship of the merchants with his life alone in his       hand;     With such love he loved his kindred, and the people of his land.     But at last he said:                         \"So be it; for in vain I war with fate,     Who can raise up a king from the dunghill and make the feeble great.     We will go, a band of friends, and be merry whatever shall come,     And the Gods, mine own forefathers, shall take counsel of our home.\"      So now, when all things were ready, in the first of the autumn tide     Adown unto the swan-bath the Volsung Children ride;     And lightly go a shipboard, a goodly company,     Though the tale thereof be scanty and their ships no more than three:     But kings' sons dealt with the sail-sheets and earls and dukes of war     Were the halers of the hawsers and the tuggers at the oar.     So they drew the bridges shipward, and left the land behind,     And fair astern of the longships sprang up a following wind;     So swift o'er Ã†gir's acre those mighty sailors ran,     And speedier than all other ploughed down the furrows wan.     And they came to the land of the Goth-folk on the even of a day;     And lo by the inmost skerry a skiff with a sail of grey     That as they neared the foreshore ran Volsung's ship aboard,     And there was come white-hand Signy with her latest warning word.      \"O strange,\" she said, \"meseemeth, O sweet, your gear to see,     And the well-loved Volsung faces, and the hands that cherished me.     But short is the time that is left me for the work I have to win,     Though nought it be but the speaking of a word ere the worst begin.     For that which I spake aforetime, the seed of a boding drear,     It hath sprung, it hath blossomed and born rank harvest of the spear;     Siggeir hath dight the death-snare; he hath spread the shielded net.     But ye come ere the hour appointed, and he looks not to meet you yet.     Now blest be the wind that wafted your sails here over-soon,     For thus have I won me seaward 'twixt the twilight and the moon,     To pray you for all the world's sake turn back from the murderous       shore.     --Ah take me hence, my father, to see my land once more!\"      Then sweetly Volsung kissed her: \"Woe am I for thy sake,     But earth the word hath hearkened, that yet unborn I spake;     How I ne'er would turn me backward from the sword or the fire of bale;     --I have held that word till today, and today shall I change the tale?     And look on these thy brethren, how goodly and great are they,     Wouldst thou have the maidens mock them, when this pain hath past away     And they sit at the feast hereafter, that they feared the deadly       stroke?     Let us do our day's work deftly for the praise and the glory of folk;     And if the Norns will have it that the Volsung kin shall fail,     Yet I know of the deed that dies not, and the name that shall ever       avail.\"      But she wept as one sick-hearted: \"Woe's me for the hope of the morn!     Yet send me not back unto Siggeir and the evil days and the scorn:     Let me bide the death as ye bide it, and let a woman feel     That hope of the death of battle and the rest of the foeman's steel.\"      \"Nay nay,\" he said, \"go backward: this too thy fate will have;     For thou art the wife of a king, and many a matter may'st save.     Farewell! as the days win over, as sweet as a tale shall it grow,     This day when our hearts were hardened; and our glory thou shalt know,     And the love wherewith we loved thee mid the battle and the wrack.\"      She kissed them and departed, and mid the dusk fared back,     And she sat that eve in the high-seat; and I deem that Siggeir knew     The way that her feet had wended, and the deed she went to do:     For the man was grim and guileful, and he knew that the snare was laid     For the mountain bull unblenching and the lion unafraid.      But when the sun on the morrow shone over earth and sea     Ashore went the Volsung Children a goodly company,     And toward King Siggeir's dwelling o'er heath and holt they went     But when they came to the topmost of a certain grassy bent,     Lo there lay the land before them as thick with shield and spear     As the rich man's wealthiest acre with the harvest of the year.     There bade King Volsung tarry and dight the wedge-array;     \"For duly,\" he said, \"doeth Siggeir to meet his guests by the way.\"     So shield by shield they serried, nor ever hath been told     Of any host of battle more glorious with the gold;     And there stood the high King Volsung in the very front of war;     And lovelier was his visage than ever heretofore.     As he rent apart the peace-strings that his brand of battle bound     And the bright blade gleamed to the heavens, and he cast the sheath       to the ground.      Then up the steep came the Goth-folk, and the spear-wood drew anigh,     And earth's face shook beneath them, yet cried they never a cry;     And the Volsungs stood all silent, although forsooth at whiles     O'er the faces grown earth-weary would play the flickering smiles,     And swords would clink and rattle: not long had they to bide,     For soon that flood of murder flowed round the hillock-side;     Then at last the edges mingled, and if men forebore the shout,     Yet the din of steel and iron in the grey clouds rang about;     But how to tell of King Volsung, and the valour of his folk!     Three times the wood of battle before their edges broke;     And the shield-wall, sorely dwindled and reft of the ruddy gold,     Against the drift of the war-blast for the fourth time yet did hold.     But men's shields were waxen heavy with the weight of shafts they bore,     And the fifth time many a champion cast earthward Odin's door     And gripped the sword two-handed; and in sheaves the spears came on.     And at last the host of the Goth-folk within the shield-wall won,     And wild was the work within it, and oft and o'er again     Forth brake the sons of Volsung, and drave the foe in vain;     For the driven throng still thickened, till it might not give aback.     But fast abode King Volsung amid the shifting wrack     In the place where once was the forefront: for he said: \"My feet are       old,     And if I wend on further there is nought more to behold     Than this that I see about me.\"--Whiles drew his foes away     And stared across the corpses that before his sword-edge lay.     But nought he followed after: then needs must they in front     Thrust on by the thickening spear-throng come up to bear the brunt,     Till all his limbs were weary and his body rent and torn:     Then he cried: \"Lo now, Allfather, is not the swathe well shorn?     Wouldst thou have me toil for ever, nor win the wages due?\"      And mid the hedge of foemen his blunted sword he threw,     And, laid like the oars of a longship the level war-shafts pressed     On 'gainst the unshielded elder, and clashed amidst his breast,     And dead he fell, thrust backward, and rang on the dead men's gear:     But still for a certain season durst no man draw anear.     For 'twas e'en as a great God's slaying, and they feared the wrath       of the sky;     And they deemed their hearts might harden if awhile they should let       him lie.      Lo, now as the plotting was long, so short is the tale to tell     How a mighty people's leaders in the field of murder fell.     For but feebly burned the battle when Volsung fell to field,     And all who yet were living were borne down before the shield:     So sinketh the din and the tumult; and the earls of the Goths ring       round     That crown of the Kings of battle laid low upon the ground,     Looking up to the noon-tide heavens from the place where first he       stood:     But the songful sing above him and they tell how his end is as good     As the best of the days of his life-tide; and well as he was loved     By his friends ere the time of his changing, so now are his foemen       moved     With a love that may never be worsened, since all the strife is o'er,     And the warders look for his coming by Odin's open door.      But his sons, the stay of battle, alive with many a wound,     Borne down to the earth by the shield-rush amid the dead lie bound,     And belike a wearier journey must those lords of battle bide     Ere once more in the Hall of Odin they sit by their father's side.     Woe's me for the boughs of the Branstock and the hawks that cried on       the fight!     Woe's me for the tireless hearthstones and the hangings of delight,     That the women dare not look on lest they see them sweat with blood!     Woe's me for the carven pillars where the spears of the Volsungs stood!     And who next shall shake the locks, or the silver door-rings meet?     Who shall pace the floor beloved, worn down by the Volsung feet?     Who shall fill the gold with the wine, or cry for the triumphing?     Shall it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#4)"],["body","kindred or foes, or thief, or thrall, or king?       _Of the ending of all Volsung's Sons save Sigmund only, and of how he     abideth in the wild wood._      So there the earls of the Goth-folk lay Volsung 'neath the grass     On the last earth he had trodden; but his children bound must pass,     When the host is gathered together, amidst of their array     To the high-built dwelling of Siggeir; for sooth it is to say,     That he came not into the battle, nor faced the Volsung sword.      So now as he sat in his high-seat there came his chiefest lord,     And he said: \"I bear thee tidings of the death of the best of the       brave,     For thy foes are slain or bondsmen; and have thou Sigmund's glaive,     If a token thou desirest; and that shall be surely enough.     And I do thee to wit, King Siggeir, that the road was exceeding rough,     And that many an earl there stumbled, who shall evermore lie down.     And indeed I deem King Volsung for all earthly kingship's crown.\"      Then never a word spake Siggeir, save: \"Where be Volsung's sons?\"     And he said: \"Without are they fettered, those battle-glorious ones:     And methinks 'twere a deed for a king, and a noble deed for thee,     To break their bonds and heal them, and send them back o'er the sea,     And abide their wrath and the bloodfeud for this matter of Volsung's       slaying:\"      \"Witless thou waxest,\" said Siggeir, \"nor heedest the wise man's       saying;     'Slay thou the wolf by the house-door, lest he slay thee in the wood.'     Yet since I am the overcomer, and my days henceforth shall be good,     I will quell them with no death-pains; let the young men smite them       down,     But let me not behold them when my heart is angrier grown.\"      E'en as he uttered the word was Signy at the door,     And with hurrying feet she gat her apace to the high-seat floor,     As wan as the dawning-hour, though never a tear she had:     And she cried: \"I pray thee, Siggeir, now thine heart is merry and glad     With the death and the bonds of my kinsmen, to grant me this one       prayer,     This one time and no other; let them breathe the earthly air     For a day, for a day or twain, ere they wend the way of death,     For 'sweet to eye while seen,' the elders' saying saith.\"      Quoth he: \"Thou art mad with sorrow; wilt thou work thy friends this       woe?     When swift and untormented e'en I would let them go:     Yet now shalt thou have thine asking, if it verily is thy will:     Nor forsooth do I begrudge them a longer tide of ill.\"      She said: \"I will it, I will it--O sweet to eye while seen!\"      Then to his earl spake Siggeir: \"There lies a wood-lawn green     In the first mile of the forest; there fetter these Volsung men     To the mightiest beam of the wild-wood, till Queen Signy come again     And pray me a boon for her brethren, the end of their latter life.\"      So the Goth-folk led to the woodland those gleanings of the strife,     And smote down a great-boled oak-tree, the mightiest they might find,     And thereto with bonds of iron the Volsungs did they bind,     And left them there on the wood-lawn, mid the yew-trees' compassing,     And went back by the light of the moon to the dwelling of the king.      But he sent on the morn of the morrow to see how his foemen fared,     For now as he thought thereover, o'ermuch he deemed it dared     That he saw not the last of the Volsungs laid dead before his feet,     Back came his men ere the noontide, and he deemed their tidings sweet;     For they said: \"We tell thee, King Siggeir, that Geirmund and Gylfi       are gone.     And we deem that a beast of the wild-wood this murder grim hath done,     For the bones yet lie in the fetters gnawed fleshless now and white;     But we deemed the eight abiding sore minished of their might.\"      So wore the morn and the noontide, and the even 'gan to fall,     And watchful eyes held Signy at home in bower and hall.      And again came the men in the morning, and spake: \"The hopples hold     The bare white bones of Helgi, and the bones of Solar the bold:     And the six that abide seem feebler than they were awhile ago.\"      Still all the day and the night-tide must Signy nurse her woe     About the house of King Siggeir, nor any might she send:     And again came the tale on the morrow: \"Now are two more come to       an end.     For Hunthiof dead and Gunthiof, their bones lie side by side,     And the four that are left, us seemeth, no long while will abide.\"      O woe for the well-watched Signy, how often on that day     Must she send her helpless eyen adown the woodland way!     Yet silent in her bosom she held her heart of flame.     And again on the morrow morning the tale was still the same:      \"We tell thee now, King Siggeir, that all will soon be done;     For the two last men of the Volsungs, they sit there one by one,     And Sigi's head is drooping, but somewhat Sigmund sings;     For the man was a mighty warrior, and a beater down of kings.     But for Rerir and for Agnar, the last of them is said,     Their bones in the bonds are abiding, but their souls and lives are       sped.\"      That day from the eyes of the watchers nought Signy strove to depart,     But ever she sat in the high-seat and nursed the flame in her heart.     In the sight of all people she sat, with unmoved face and wan,     And to no man gave she a word, nor looked on any man.     Then the dusk and the dark drew over, but stirred she never a whit,     And the word of Siggeir's sending, she gave no heed to it.     And there on the morrow morning must he sit him down by her side,     When unto the council of elders folk came from far and wide.     And there came Siggeir's woodmen, and their voice in the hall arose:      \"There is no man left on the tree-beam: some beast hath devoured thy       foes;     There is nought left there but the bones, and the bonds that the       Volsungs bound.\"      No word spake the earls of the Goth-folk, but the hall rang out with       a sound,     With the wail and the cry of Signy, as she stood upright on her feet,     And thrust all people from her, and fled to her bower as fleet     As the hind when she first is smitten; and her maidens fled away,     Fearing her face and her eyen: no less at the death of the day     She rose up amid the silence, and went her ways alone,     And no man watched her or hindered, for they deemed the story done.     So she went 'twixt the yellow acres, and the green meads of the sheep,     And or ever she reached the wild-wood the night was waxen deep     No man she had to lead her, but the path was trodden well     By those messengers of murder, the men with the tale to tell;     And the beams of the high white moon gave a glimmering day through       night     Till she came where that lawn of the woods lay wide in the flood of       light.     Then she looked, and lo, in its midmost a mighty man there stood,     And laboured the earth of the green-sward with a truncheon torn from       the wood;     And behold, it was Sigmund the Volsung: but she cried and had no fear:      \"If thou art living, Sigmund, what day's work dost thou here     In the midnight and the forest? but if thou art nought but a ghost,     Then where are those Volsung brethren, of whom thou wert best and       most?\"      Then he turned about unto her, and his raiment was fouled and torn,     And his eyen were great and hollow, as a famished man forlorn;      But he cried: \"Hail, Sister Signy! I looked for thee before,     Though what should a woman compass, she one alone and no more,     When all we shielded Volsungs did nought in Siggeir's land?     O yea, I am living indeed, and this labour of mine hand     Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs; and lo, it is well-nigh done.     So draw near, Volsung's daughter, and pile we many a stone     Where lie the grey wolf's gleanings of what was once so good.\"      So she set her hand to the labour, and they toiled, they twain in       the wood     And when the work was over, dead night was beginning to fail:     Then spake the white-hand Signy: \"Now shalt thou tell the tale     Of the death of the Volsung brethren ere the wood thy wrath shall hide,     Ere I wend me back sick-hearted in the dwelling of kings to abide.\"      He said: \"We sat on the tree, and well ye may wot indeed     That we had some hope from thy good-will amidst that bitter need.     Now none had 'scaped the sword-edge in the battle utterly,     And so hurt were Agnar and Helgi, that, unhelped, they were like to       die;     Though for that we deemed them happier: but now when the moon shone       bright,     And when by a doomed man's deeming 'twas the midmost of the night,     Lo, forth from yonder thicket were two mighty wood-wolves come,     Far huger wrought to my deeming than the beasts I knew at home:     Forthright on Gylfi and Geirmund those dogs of the forest fell,     And what of men so hoppled should be the tale to tell?     They tore them midst the irons, and slew them then and there,     And long we heard them snarling o'er that abundant cheer.     Night after night, O my sister, the story was the same,     And still from the dark and the thicket the wild-wood were-wolves came     And slew two men of the Volsungs whom the sword edge might not end.     And every day in the dawning did the King's own woodmen wend     To behold those craftsmen's carving and rejoice King Siggeir's heart.     And so was come last midnight, when I must play my part:     Forsooth when those first were murdered my heart was as blood and fire;     And I deemed that my bonds must burst with my uttermost desire     To free my naked hands, that the vengeance might be wrought;     But now was I wroth with the Gods, that had made the Volsungs for       nought     And I said: in the Day of their Doom a man's help shall they miss;     I will be as a wolf of the forest, if their kings must come to this;  "]]]
