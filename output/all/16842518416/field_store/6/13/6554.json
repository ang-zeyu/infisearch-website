I dared not look in his direction.  After the service was over I went up to him.  I knew that he needed a bit of laughter now.  I knew that I did, too.  So I said to him: \"Lad, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't helped us out on the singing this evening.\"  He looked at me with infinite pathos and sorrow in his eyes.  Then a look of triumph came into them, and he looked up and whispered through his rasped voice: \"I may not be able to make much noise any more, and I may never be able to lead the choir again, but I'll always have singing in my soul, sir!  I'll always have singing in my soul!\"  And so it is with the whole American army in France--it always has singing in its soul, and courage, and manliness, and daring, and hope. That kind of an army can never be defeated.  And no army in the world, and no power, can stand long before that kind of an army.  That kind of an army doesn't have to be sent into battle with a barrage of shells in front of it and a barrage of shells back of it to force it in, as the Germans have been doing during the last big offensive, according to stories that boys at Ch√¢teau-Thierry have been telling me. The kind of an army that, in spite of wounds and gas, \"still has singing in its soul\" will conquer all hell on earth before it gets through.  Then there is the memory of the boys in the shell-shock ward at this same hospital.  I had a long visit with them.  They were not permitted to come to the vesper service for fear something would happen to upset their nerves.  But they made a special request that I come to visit them in their ward.  After the service I went.  I reached their ward about nine, and they arose to greet me.  The nurse told me that they were more at ease on their feet than lying down, and so for two hours we stood and talked on our feet.  \"How did you get yours?\" I asked a little black-eyed New Yorker.  \"I was in a front-line trench with my 'outfit,' down near Amiens,\" he said.  \"We were having a pretty warm scrap.  I was firing a machine-gun so fast that it was red-hot.  I was afraid it would melt down, and I would be up against it.  They were coming over in droves, and we were mowing them down so fast that out in front of our company they looked like stacks of hay, the dead Germans piled up everywhere.  I was so busy firing my gun, and watching it so carefully because it was so hot, that I didn't hear the shell that suddenly burst behind me.  If I had heard it coming it would never have shocked me.\"  \"If you hear them coming you're all right?\" I asked.  \"Yes.  It's the ones that surprise you that give you shell-shock.  If you hear the whine you're ready for them; but if your mind is on something else, as mine was that day, and the thing bursts close, it either kills you or gives you shell-shock, so it gets you both going and coming.\"  He laughed at this.  \"I was all right for a while after the thing fell, for I was unconscious for a half-hour.  When I came to I began to shake, and I've been shaking ever since.\"  \"How did you get yours?\" I asked another lad, from Kansas, for I saw at once that it eased them to talk about it.  \"I was in a trench when a big Jack Johnson burst right behind me.  It killed six of the boys, all my friends, and buried me under the dirt that fell from the parapet back of me.  I had sense and strength enough to dig myself out.  When I got out I was kind of dazed.  The captain told me to go back to the rear.  I started back through the communication-trench and got lost.  The next thing I knew I was wandering around in the darkness shakin' like a leaf.\"  Then there was the California boy.  I had known him before.  It was he who almost gave me a case of shell-shock.  The last time I saw him he was standing on a platform addressing a crowd of young church people in California.  And there he was, his six foot three shaking from head to foot like an old man with palsy, and stuttering every word he spoke. He had been sent to the hospital at Amiens with a case of acute appendicitis.  The first night he was in the hospital the Germans bombed it and destroyed it.  They took him out and put him on a train for Paris.  This train had only gotten a few miles out of Amiens when the Germans shelled it and destroyed two cars.  \"After that I began to shake,\" he said simply.  \"No wonder, man; who wouldn't shake after that?\" I said.  Then I asked him if he had had his operation yet.  \"It can't be done until I quit shaking.\"  \"When will you quit?\" I asked, with a smile.  \"Oh, we're all getting better, much better; we'll be out of here in a few months; they all get better; 90 per cent of us get back in the trenches.\"  And that is the silver lining to this Silhouette Spiritual.  The doctors say that a very large percentage of them get back.  \"We call ourselves the 'First American Shock Troops,'\" my friend from the West said with a grin.  \"I guess you are 'shock troops,' all right.  I know one thing, and that is that you would give your folks back home a good shock if they saw you.\"  Then we all laughed.  Laughter was in the air.  I have never met anywhere in France such a happy, hopeful, cheerful crowd as that bunch of shell-shocked boys.  It was contagious.  I went there to cheer them up, and I got cheered up.  I went there to give them strength, and came away stronger than when I went in.  It would cheer the hearts of all Americans to take a peep into that room; if they could see the souls back of the trembling bodies; if they could get beyond the first shock of those trembling bodies and stuttering tongues.  And, after all, that is what America must learn to do, to get beyond, and to see beyond, the wounds, into the soul of the boy; to see beyond the blinded eyes, the scarred faces, the legless and armless lads, into the glory of their new-born souls, for no boy goes through the hell of fire and suffering and wounds that he does not come out new-born.  The old man is gone from him, and a new man is born in him.  That is the great eternal compensation of war and suffering.  I have seen boys come out of battles made new men.  I have seen them go into the line sixteen-year-old lads, and come out of the trenches men. I saw a lad who had gone through the fighting in Belleau Woods.  I talked with him in the hospital at Paris.  His face was terribly wounded.  He was ugly to look at, but when I talked with him I found a soul as white as a lily and as courageous as granite.  \"I may look awful,\" he said, \"but I'm a new man inside.  What I saw out there in the woods made me different, somehow.  I saw a friend stand by his machine-gun, with a whole platoon of Germans sweeping down on him, and he never flinched.  He fired that old gun until every bullet was gone and his gun was red-hot.  I was lying in the grass where I could see it all.  I saw them bayonet him.  He fought to the last against fifty men, but, thank God, he died a man; he died an American.  I lay there and cried to see them kill him, but every time I think of that fellow it makes me want to be more of a man.  When I get back home I'm going to give up my life to some kind of Christian service.  I'm going to do it because I saw that man die so bravely.  If he can die like that, in spite of my face I can live like a man.\"  The boys in the trenches live a year in a month, a month in a week, a week in a day, a day in an hour, and sometimes an eternity in a second. No wonder it makes men of them overnight.  No wonder they come out of it all with that \"high look\" that John Oxenham writes about.  They have been reborn.  Another wounded boy who had gone through the fighting back of Montdidier said to me in the hospital:  \"I never thought of anybody else at home but myself.  I was selfish. Sis and mother did everything for me.  Everything at home centred in me, and everything was arranged for my comfort.  With this leg gone I might have some right now, according to the way they think, to that attention, but I don't want it any longer.  I can't bear the thoughts of having people do for me.  I want to spend the rest of my life doing things for other folks.  \"Back of Noyon I saw a friend sail into a crowd of six Germans with nothing but his bayonet and rifle.  They had surrounded his captain, and were rushing him back as a prisoner.  They evidently had orders to take the officers alive as prisoners.  That big top-sergeant sailed into them, and after killing two of them, knocking two more down, and giving his captain a chance to escape, the last German shot him through the head.  He gave his life for the captain.  That has changed me.  I shall never be the same again after seeing that happen.  There's something come into my heart.  I'm going back home a Christian man.\"  Yes, America must learn to see beyond the darkness, beyond the disfigured face, to the soul of the boy.  And America will do it. America is like that.  And so back of these shaking bodies and these stuttering tongues of the shell-shocked boys I saw their wonderful souls.  And after spending that two hours with them I can never be the same man again.  I could, as Donald Hankey says, \"get down on my knees and shine their boots for them any day,\" and thank God for the privilege.  I think that this is the spirit of any non-combatant in France who has any immediate contact with our men on the battle-front or in the hospitals.  They are so brave and so true.  \"How do the Americans stand dressing their wounds and the suffering in the hospitals?\" a friend of mine asked a prominent surgeon.  \"They bear their suffering like Frenchmen.  That is the highest compliment I can pay them,\" he replied.  And so back of their wounds are their immortal, undying, unflinching souls.  And back of the tremblings of these boys that night, thank God, I had the glory of seeing their immortal souls, and to me the soul of an American boy under fire and pain is the biggest, finest, most"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18078"],["title","Soldier Silhouettes on Our Front (#5)"],["body","thing on earth.  I bow before it in humility.  It dazzled mine eyes.  All I could think of as I saw it was:    \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\"   That night I said, just before I left: \"Boys, it's Sunday evening, and they wouldn't let you come to my meeting!  Would you like for me to have a little prayer with you?\"  \"Yes!  Sure!  That's just what we want!\" were the stammered words that followed.  \"All right; we'll just stand, if it's easier for you.\"  Then I prayed the prayer that had been burning in my heart every minute as we stood there in that dimly lit ward, talking of home and battle and the folks we all loved across the seas.  All that time there had been hovering in the background of my mind a picture of a cool body of water named Galilee, and of a Christ who had been sleeping in a boat on that water with some of his friends, when a storm came up.  I had been thinking of how frightened those friends had been of the storm; of the tossing, tumbling, turbulent waves.  I had thought of how they had trembled with fear, and then of how they had appealed to the Master.  I told the boys simply that story, and then I prayed:  \"O Thou Christ who stilled the waves of Galilee, come Thou into the hearts of these boys just now, and still their trembling limbs and tongues.  Bring a great sense of peace and quiet into their souls.\"  \"Oh, ye of little faith!\"  When I looked up from that prayer, much to my own astonishment, and to the astonishment of the friend who was with me, the tremblings of those fine American boys had perceptibly ceased. There was a great sense of quiet and peace in the ward.  The nurse told me the next day that after I had gone the boys went quietly to bed; that there was little tossing that night and no walking the floors, as there had been before.  A doctor friend said to me: \"After all, maybe your medicine is best, for while we are more or less groping in the dark as to our treatment of shell-shock, we do know that the only cure will be that something comes into their souls to give them quiet of mind and peace within.\"  \"I know what that medicine is,\" I told him.  \"I have seen it work.\"  \"What is it?\" he asked.  Then I told him of my experience.  \"You may be right.\"  And so it is all over France; where I have worked in some twenty hospitals--from the first-aid dressing-stations back through the evacuation hospitals to the base hospitals--and have found that the reaction of our boys to wounds and suffering is always a spiritual reaction.  I know as I know no other thing, that the boys of America are to come back, wounded or otherwise, a better crowd of men than they went away.  They are men reborn, and when they come back, when it's \"over, over there,\" there is to be a nation reborn because of the leaven that is within their souls.     V  SILHOUETTES OF SACRILEGE  During the last year there has come into French art a new era of the silhouette.  In every art store in Paris one sees wonderful silhouettes which tell the story of the horror of the Hun better than any words can paint it, and when one attempts to paint it he must attempt it in word silhouettes.  The silhouette catches the picture better than color.  Gaunt, naked, ruined cathedrals, homes, towers, and forests are better pictured in black silhouettes than any other way.  There is nothing much left in some places in France but silhouettes.  Those who have seen Rheims know that the best reproduction of its ruins has been conveyed by the simple silhouette of the artist.  There it stands outlined against the sky.  Rheims that was once the wonder of the world is now naked ruins, tottering walls, with its towers still standing, looming against the sky like tottering trees.  And when, during the past year, the walls fell, they:    \"Left a lonesome place against the sky\"  of all the world.  The church at Albert was like that.  Only a silhouette can describe or picture it.  There it stood against the sky by day and night, with the figure on its top leaning.  The old legend of the soldiers that when the figure of the Virgin fell to the earth the war would end has been dissipated, for during the last drive that figure fell, and the tower with it.  But forever (although it has fallen to dust and debris, because of descriptions we have seen of it) it shall stand out in our memories like a lonely, toppling tree against a crimson sunset!  Every day on the Toul line we used to drive through a village that had been shelled until it was in ruins.  Only the tower and the walls of a beautiful little church remained.  Every other house in the village was razed to the ground.  Nothing else remained.  There it stands to this day, for when I saw it last in June it was still standing as it was in January.  Every evening about sunset we used to drive down that way, taking supplies to the front-line huts. Many things stand out in one's memory of a certain road over which he drives night after night and day after day.  There is the cross at the forks of the roads.  There is the old monastery, battered and in ruins, that stood out like a gaunt ghost of the vandal Hun.  There was the little God's acre along the road which we passed every day.  There were always the observation-balloons against the evening sky.  There were always the fleet-winged birds of the air outlined against the evening. There were always the marching men and the ambulance trains.  But standing out above them all, etched with the acid of regret and anger and horror, stood that lonely tower.  Night after night we approached it with a beautiful sunset off to the west where the Germans lay buried in their trenches.  Coming back from the German lines we would see this church-tower outlined against the crimson sky like a finger pointing God-ward, and declaring to all the world that the God above would avenge this silent, accusing Silhouette of Sacrilege.  There has been a good deal of discussion over a certain book entitled \"I Accuse.\"  I never saw that finger pointing into the sky as we drove through this village that it did not cry out to the heavens and across the short miles to the German Huns, looking down, as it did, at its feet where the ruined homes lay, the village that it had mothered and fathered, the village that had worshipped within its simple walls, the village that had brought its joys and sorrows there, the village that had buried the dead within its shadows, the village that had brought its young there to be married and its aged to be buried; there it stood, night after night, against the crimson sky sometimes, against the golden sky at other times; against the rose, against the blue, against the purple sunsets; and ever it thundered: \"I accuse!  I accuse!  I accuse!\"  Then there is that Silhouette of Sacrilege up on the Baupaume Road. This is called \"the saddest road in Christendom,\" because more men have been killed along its scarred pathway than along any other road in all the world.  Not even the road to Calvary was as sad as this road.  Along this road when the French held it, during the first year of the war, they gathered their dead together and buried them in a little cemetery.  Above the sacred remains of their comrades these French soldiers erected a simple bronze cross as a symbol not only of the faith of the nation, but a symbol also of the cause in which they had died.  A few months later when the Germans had recaptured this spot, and it had been fought over, and the bronze cross still stood, the Hun, too, gathered his dead together and buried them side by side with the French.  Then he did a characteristic thing.  He got a large stone as a base and mounted a cannon-ball on top of this stone, and left it there, side by side with the French cross.  Whether he meant it or not, his sacrilege stands as a fitting expression of his philosophy, the philosophy of the brute, the religion of the granite rock and the iron cannon-ball.  He told his own story here.  Side by side in those two monuments the contrast is made, the causes are placed.  One is the cause of the cross, the cause of men willing to die for brotherhood; the other is the cause of those who are willing to kill to conquer.  And these two monuments, side by side on the Baupaume Road, stand out as one of the Silhouettes of Sacrilege.  Then there is St. Gervais.  On Good Friday afternoon a Hun shell pierced the side of this beautiful cathedral as the spear-thrust pierced the side of the Master so long ago.  On the very hour that Jesus was crucified back on that other and first Good Friday the Hun threw his bolt of death into the nave of this church, and crucified seventy-five people kneeling in memory of their Saviour's death.  I was in that church an hour after this terrible sacrilege happened. Never can one forget the scene.  I dare not describe it here in its awful details.  The entire arches of stone that held up the roof had fallen in from the concussion of the gases of the shell.  Three feet of solid stones covered the floor.  Men and women were being carried out.  Silk hats, canes, shoes, hats, baby clothes, an expensive fur, lay buried in the stone and dirt.  As I stood horrified, looking on this scene of death and destruction, the phrase came into my heart:    \"And the veil of the temple was rent in twain.\"   And this scene, too, shall remain as one of the Silhouettes of Sacrilege.  But perhaps the worst Silhouette of Sacrilege that the film of one's memory has brought away from France is that of a certain afternoon in Paris.  I happened to be walking along the Boulevard to my hotel.  The big gun had been throwing its shells into the city all day.  Suddenly one fell so close to where I was walking that it broke the windows around me, and I was nearly thrown to my feet.  In my soul I cursed the Hun, as all who have lived in Paris finally come to be doing as each shell bursts.  But I had more reason to curse than I knew at that moment.  The people were running into a side"]]]
