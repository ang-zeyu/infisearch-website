It is an Atlantic      port, lying, I may say, in the track of the ocean steamers, and      by establishing it as the American telegraphic station, news      could be communicated to the whole American continent      forty-eight hours, _at least_, sooner than by any other route.      But how will this be accomplished? Just look at the map of      Newfoundland and Cape Breton. From St. John's to Cape Ray there      is no difficulty in establishing a line passing near Holy-Rood      along the neck of land connecting Trinity and Placentia Bays,      and thence in a direction due west to the Cape. You have then      about forty-one to forty-five miles of sea to St. Paul's      Island, with deep soundings of one hundred fathoms, so that the      electric cable will be perfectly safe from icebergs. Thence to      Cape North, in Cape Breton, is little more than twelve miles.      Thus it is not only practicable to bring America two days      nearer to Europe by this route, but should the telegraphic      communication between England and Ireland, sixty-two miles, be      realized, it presents not the least difficulty. Of course, we      in Newfoundland will have nothing to do with the erection,      working, and maintenance of the telegraph; but I suppose our      Government will give every facility to the company, either      English or American, who will undertake it, as it will be an      incalculable advantage to this country. I hope the day is not      far distant when St. John's will be the first link in the      electric chain which will unite the Old World and the New.                                J. T. M.       St. John's, November 8, 1850.  This suggestion came at the right moment, since it quickened, if it did not originate, the first attempt to link the island of Newfoundland with the mainland of America. For about the same time, the attention of Mr. Frederick N. Gisborne, a telegraph operator, was attracted to a similar project. Being a man of great quickness of mind, he instantly saw the importance of such a work, and took hold of it with enthusiasm. It might easily occur to him without suggestion from any source. He had had much experience in telegraphs, and was then engaged in constructing a telegraph line in Nova Scotia. Whether, therefore, the idea was first with him or with the bishop, is of little consequence. It might occur at the same time to two intelligent minds, and show the sagacity of both.  But having taken hold of this idea, Mr. Gisborne pursued it with indomitable resolution. As the labors of this gentleman were most important in the beginning of this work, it is a pleasure to recognize his untiring zeal and energy. In assurance of this we could have no higher authority than the following from the late Mr. E. M. Archibald, who was at the time Attorney-General of Newfoundland, and afterwards for many years British Consul at New York:       \"It was during the winter of 1849-50, that Mr. Gisborne, who      had been, as an engineer, engaged in extending the electric      telegraph through Lower Canada and New Brunswick to Halifax,      Nova Scotia, conceived the project of a telegraph to connect      St. John's, the most easterly port of America, with the main      continent. The importance of the geographical position of      Newfoundland, in the event of a telegraph ever being carried      across the Atlantic, was about the same time promulgated by Dr.      Mullock, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, in a St.      John's newspaper.       \"In the spring of the following year (1851), Mr. Gisborne      visited Newfoundland, appeared before the Legislature, then in      session, and explained the details of his plan, which was an      overland line from St. John's to Cape Ray, nearly four hundred      miles in length, and (the submarine cable between Dover and      Calais not having then been laid) a communication between Cape      Ray and Cape Breton by steamer and carrier-pigeons,      eventually, it was hoped, by a submarine cable across the Gulf      of St. Lawrence. The Legislature encouraged the project,      granted Â£500 sterling to enable Mr. Gisborne to make an      exploratory survey of the proposed line to Cape Ray, and passed      an act authorizing its construction, with certain privileges,      and the appointment of commissioners for the purpose of      carrying it out. Upon this, Mr. Gisborne, who was then the      chief officer of the Nova Scotia Telegraph Company, returned to      that province, resigned his situation, and devoted himself to      the project of the Newfoundland telegraph. Having organized a      local company for the purpose of constructing the first      telegraph line in the island, from St. John's to Carbonear, a      distance of sixty miles, he, on the fourth of September, set      out upon the arduous expedition of a survey of the proposed      line to Cape Ray, which occupied upward of three months, during      which time himself and his party suffered severe privations,      and narrowly escaped starvation, having to traverse the most      rugged and hitherto unexplored part of the island.[A] On his      return, having reported to the Legislature favorably of the      project, and furnished estimates of the cost, he determined to      proceed to New York, to obtain assistance to carry it out....      Mr. Gisborne returned to St. John's in the spring of 1852,      when, at his instance, an act, incorporating himself (his being      the only name mentioned in it) and such others as might become      shareholders in a company, to be called the Newfoundland      Electric Telegraph Company, was passed, granting an exclusive      right to erect telegraphs in Newfoundland for thirty years,      with certain concessions of land, by way of encouragement, to      be granted upon the completion of the telegraph from St. John's      to Cape Ray. Mr. Gisborne then returned to New York, where he      organized, under this charter, a company, of which Mr. Tebbets      and Mr. Holbrook[B] were prominent members, made his financial      arrangements with them, and proceeded to England to contract      for the cable from Cape Ray to Prince Edward Island, and from      thence to the mainland. Returning in the autumn, he proceeded      in a small steamer, in November of that year, 1852, to stretch      the first submarine cable, of any length, in America, across      the Northumberland Strait from Prince Edward Island to New      Brunswick, which cable, however, was shortly afterward broken,      and a new one was subsequently laid down by the New York,      Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company. In the spring of      the following year, 1853, Mr. Gisborne set vigorously to work      to complete his favorite project of the line (which he intended      should be chiefly underground) from St. John's to Cape Ray. He      had constructed some thirty or forty miles of road, and was      proceeding with every prospect of success, when, most      unexpectedly, those of the company who were to furnish the      needful funds dishonored his bills, and brought his operations      to a sudden termination. He and the creditors of the company      were for several months buoyed up with promises of forthcoming      means from his New York allies, which promises were finally      entirely unfulfilled; and Gisborne, being the only ostensible      party, was sued and prosecuted on all sides, stripped of his      whole property, and himself arrested to answer the claims of      the creditors of the company. He cheerfully and honorably gave      up every thing he possessed, and did his utmost to relieve the      severe distress in which the poor laborers on the line had been      involved.\"  This is a testimony most honorable to the engineer who first led the way through a pathless wilderness. But this Newfoundland scheme is not to be confounded with that of the Atlantic Telegraph, which did not come into existence until a year or two later. The latter was not at all included in the former. Indeed, Mr. Gisborne himself says, in a letter referring to his original project: \"My plans were to run a subterranean line from Cape Race to Cape Ray, fly carrier-pigeons and run boats across the Straits of Northumberland to Cape Breton, and thence by overland lines convey the news to New York.\" He adds however: \"Meanwhile Mr. Brett's experimental cable between Dover and Calais having proved successful, I set forth in my report, [which appeared a year after his first proposal], that 'carrier-pigeons and boats would be required only until such time as the experiments then making in England with submarine cables should warrant a similar attempt between Cape Ray and Cape Breton.'\" But nowhere in his report does he allude to the possibility of ever spanning the mighty gulf of the Atlantic.  But several years after, when the temporary success of the Atlantic Telegraph gave a name to everybody connected with it, he or his friends seemed not unwilling to have it supposed that this was embraced in the original scheme. When asked why he did not publish his large design to the world, he answered: \"Because I was looked upon as a wild visionary by my friends, and pronounced a fool by my relatives for resigning a lucrative government appointment in favor of such a laborious speculation as the Newfoundland connection. Now had I coupled it at that time with an Atlantic line, all confidence in the prior undertaking would have been destroyed, and my object defeated.\" This may have been a reason for not announcing such a project to the public, but not for withholding it from his friends. A man can hardly lay claim to that which he holds in such absolute reserve.  However, whether he ever entertained the _idea_ of such a project, is not a matter of the slightest consequence to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34765"],["title","The Story of the Atlantic Telegraph (#3)"],["body","blic, nor even to his own reputation. Ten years before Professor Morse had expressed, not a dreamer's fancy, but a deliberate conviction, founded on scientific experiments, that \"a telegraphic communication might with certainty be established across the Atlantic Ocean;\" so that the idea was not original with Mr. Gisborne, any more than with others who were eager to appropriate it.  It is a part of the history of great enterprises, that the moment one succeeds, a host spring up to claim the honor. Thus when, in 1858, the Atlantic Telegraph seemed to be a success, the public, knowing well who had borne the brunt and burden of the undertaking, awarded him the praise which he so well deserved; but instantly there were other Richmonds in the field. Those who had had no part in the labor, at least claimed to have originated the idea! Of course, these many claims destroy each other. But after all, to raise such a point at all is the merest trifling. The question is not who first had the \"idea,\" but who took hold of the enterprise as a practical thing; who grappled with the gigantic difficulties of the undertaking, and fought the battle through to victory.  As to Mr. Gisborne, his activity in the beginning of the Newfoundland telegraph is a matter of history. In that preliminary work, he bore an honorable part, and acquired a title to respect, of which he cannot be deprived. All honor to him for his enterprise, his courage, and his perseverance!  But for the company of which he was the father, which he had got up with so much toil, it lived but a few months, when it became involved in debt some fifty thousand dollars, chiefly to laborers on the line, and ended its existence by an ignominious failure. The concern was bankrupt, and it was plain that, if the work was not to be finally abandoned, it must be taken up by stronger hands.  FOOTNOTES:  [A] \"On the fourth day of December, I accomplished the survey through three hundred and fifty miles of wood and wilderness. It was an arduous undertaking. My original party, consisting of six white men, were exchanged for four Indians; of the latter party, two deserted, one died a few days after my return, and the other, 'Joe Paul,' has ever since proclaimed himself an ailing man.\"--_Letter of Mr. Gisborne._  [B] Horace B. Tebbets and Darius B. Holbrook.     CHAPTER II.  CAN THE OCEAN BE SPANNED?   Mr. Gisborne left Halifax and came to New York in January, 1854. Here he took counsel with his friend Tebbets and others; but they could give him no relief. It was while in this state of suspense that he met, at the Astor House, Mr. Matthew D. Field, an engineer who had been engaged in building railroads and suspension bridges at the South and West. Mr. Field listened to his story with interest, and engaged to speak of it to his brother, Cyrus W. Field,[A] a merchant of New York, who had retired from business the year before, and had spent six months in travelling over the mountains of South America, from which he had lately returned. Accordingly, he introduced the subject, but found his brother disinclined to embark in any new undertaking. Though still a young man, his life had been for many years one of incessant devotion to business. He had accumulated an ample fortune, and was not disposed to renew the cares, the anxieties, and the fatigues of his former life. But listening to the details of a scheme which had in it much to excite interest, and which by its very difficulty stimulated the spirit of enterprise, he at length consented to see Mr. Gisborne, and invited him to his house. Accordingly he came, and spent an evening describing the route of his proposed telegraph, and the points it was to connect. After he left, Mr. Field took the globe which was standing in the library, and began to turn it over. _It was while thus studying the globe that the idea first occurred to him, that the telegraph might be carried further still, and be made to span the Atlantic Ocean._ The idea was not original with him, though he was to carry it out. It was indeed new _to him_; but it had long been a matter of speculation with scientific minds, though their theories had never attracted his attention. But once he had grasped the idea, it took strong hold of his imagination. Had the Newfoundland scheme stood alone, he would never have undertaken it. He cared little about shortening communication with Europe by a day or two, by relays of boats and carrier-pigeons. But it was the hope of further and grander results that inspired him to enter on a work of which no man could foresee the end.  An enterprise of such proportions, that would task to the utmost the science and the engineering skill of the world, was not to be rashly undertaken; and before giving a definite reply to Gisborne, Mr. Field determined to apply to the highest authorities in his own country.  The project of an Atlantic telegraph involved two problems: Could a cable be stretched across the ocean? and if it were, would it be good for anything to convey messages? The first was a question of mechanical difficulties, requiring a careful survey of the ocean itself, fathoming its depth, finding out the character of its bottom, whether level, or rough and volcanic; and all the obstacles that might be found in the winds that agitate the surface above, or the mighty currents that sweep through the waters below. The second problem was purely scientific, involving questions as to the laws of electricity, not then fully understood, and on which the boldest might feel that he was venturing on uncertain ground.  Such were the two elements or forces of nature to be encountered--the ocean and the electric current. Could they be controlled by any power of man? The very proposal was enough to stagger the faith even of an enthusiast. Who could lay a bridle on the neck of the sea? The attempt seemed as idle as that of Xerxes to bind it with chains. Was it possible to combat the fierceness of the winds and waves, and to stretch one long line from continent to continent? And then, after the work was achieved, would the lightning run along the ocean-bed from shore to shore? Such were the questions which had puzzled many an anxious brain, and which now troubled the one who was to undertake the work.  To get some light in his perplexity, Mr. Field, the very next morning after his interview with Gisborne, wrote two letters, one to Lieutenant Maury, then at the head of the National Observatory at Washington, on the nautical difficulties of the undertaking, asking if the sea were itself a barrier too great to be overcome; and the other to Professor Morse, inquiring if it would be possible to telegraph over a distance so great as that from Europe to America?  The mail soon brought an answer from Lieutenant Maury, which began: \"Singularly enough, just as I received your letter, I was closing one to the Secretary of the Navy on the same subject.\" A copy of this he inclosed to Mr. Field, and it is given here. It shows the conclusions at which, even at that early day, scientific men were beginning to arrive:                                \"National Observatory,                               Washington, February 22, 1854.       \"Sir: The United States brig Dolphin, Lieutenant Commanding O.      H. Berryman, was employed last summer upon especial service      connected with the researches that are carried on at this      office concerning the winds and currents of the sea. Her      observations were confined principally to that part of the      ocean which the merchantmen, as they pass to and fro upon the      business of trade between Europe and the United States, use as      their great thoroughfare. Lieutenant Berryman availed himself      of this opportunity to carry along also a line of deep-sea      soundings, from the shores of Newfoundland to those of Ireland.      The result is highly interesting, in so far as the bottom of      the sea is concerned, upon the question of a submarine      telegraph across the Atlantic; and I therefore beg leave to      make it the subject of a special report.       \"This line of deep-sea soundings seems to be decisive of the      question of the practicability of a submarine telegraph between      the two continents, _in so far as the bottom of the deep sea is      concerned_. From Newfoundland to Ireland, the distance between      the nearest points is about sixteen hundred miles;[B] and the      bottom of the sea between the two places is a plateau, which      seems to have been placed there especially for the purpose of      holding the wires of a submarine telegraph, and of keeping them      out of harm's way. It is neither too deep nor too shallow; yet      it is so deep that the wires but once landed, will remain for      ever beyond the reach of vessels' anchors, icebergs, and drifts      of any kind, and so shallow, that the wires may be readily      lodged upon the bottom. The depth of this plateau is quite      regular, gradually increasing from the shores of Newfoundland      to the depth of from fifteen hundred to two thousand fathoms,      as you approach the other side. The distance between Ireland      and Cape St. Charles, or Cape St. Lewis, in Labrador, is      somewhat less than the distance from any point of Ireland to      the nearest point of Newfoundland. But whether it would be      better to lead the wires from Newfoundland or Labrador is not      now the question; nor do I pretend to consider the question as      to the possibility of finding _a time calm enough, the sea      smooth enough, a wire long enough, a ship big enough_, to lay a      coil of wire sixteen hundred miles in length: though I have no      fear but that the enterprise and ingenuity of the age, whenever      called on with these problems, will be ready with a      satisfactory and practical solution of them.       \"I simply address myself at this time to the question in so far      as _the bottom of the sea_ is concerned, and as"]]]
