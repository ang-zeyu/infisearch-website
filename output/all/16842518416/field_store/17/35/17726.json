His eyes were sharp as he addressed Dale.  “Milt, wasn't you held up?”  “No. But some long-haired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls. Wanted to throw his gun on me. I was sure scared,” replied Dale, as he deposited the luggage.  Bo laughed. Her eyes, resting upon Dale, were warm and bright. The young man at the coach door took a second look at her, and then a smile changed the dark hardness of his face.  Dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage, and then, placing the lighter luggage, in with them, he threw the heavier pieces on top.  “Joe, climb up,” he said.  “Wal, Milt,” drawled the driver, “let's ooze along.”  Dale hesitated, with his hand on the door. He glanced at the crowd, now edging close again, and then at Helen.  “I reckon I ought to tell you,” he said, and indecision appeared to concern him.  “What?” exclaimed Helen.  “Bad news. But talkin' takes time. An' we mustn't lose any.”  “There's need of hurry?” queried Helen, sitting up sharply.  “I reckon.”  “Is this the stage to Snowdrop?  “No. That leaves in the mornin'. We rustled this old trap to get a start to-night.”  “The sooner the better. But I--I don't understand,” said Helen, bewildered.  “It'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage,” returned Dale.  “Safe! Oh, what do you mean?” exclaimed Helen. Apprehensively she gazed at him and then back at Bo.  “Explainin' will take time. An' facts may change your mind. But if you can't trust me--”  “Trust you!” interposed Helen, blankly. “You mean to take us to Snowdrop?”  “I reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit Snowdrop,” he replied, shortly.  “Then to Pine--to my uncle--Al Auchincloss?  “Yes, I'm goin' to try hard.”  Helen caught her breath. She divined that some peril menaced her. She looked steadily, with all a woman's keenness, into this man's face. The moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store for her. Her future and that of Bo's were now to be dependent upon her judgments. It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she welcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of buckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone of his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she saw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was clear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean-cut, strong-jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.  “Yes, I'll trust you,” she said. “Get in, and let us hurry. Then you can explain.”  “All ready, Bill. Send 'em along,” called Dale.  He had to stoop to enter the stage, and, once in, he appeared to fill that side upon which he sat. Then the driver cracked his whip; the stage lurched and began to roll; the motley crowd was left behind. Helen awakened to the reality, as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the hunter, that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began with the rattling roll of that old stage-coach.  Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between his knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was bareheaded. Helen had never seen a face like that, which at first glance appeared darkly bronzed and hard, and then became clear, cold, aloof, still, intense. She wished she might see a smile upon it. And now that the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was singular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One instant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and again that it was neither.  “I'm glad you've got your sister,” he said, presently.  “How did you know she's my sister?”  “I reckon she looks like you.”  “No one else ever thought so,” replied Helen, trying to smile.  Bo had no difficulty in smiling, as she said, “Wish I was half as pretty as Nell.”  “Nell. Isn't your name Helen?” queried Dale.  “Yes. But my--some few call me Nell.”  “I like Nell better than Helen. An' what's yours?” went on Dale, looking at Bo.  “Mine's Bo. Just plain B-o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they gave it to me,” she replied.  “Bo. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many people for years.”  “Oh! we've left the town!” cried Bo. “Look, Nell! How bare! It's just like desert.”  “It is desert. We've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a tree.”  Helen glanced out. A flat, dull-green expanse waved away from the road on and on to a bright, dark horizon-line, where the sun was setting rayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a cold thrill.  “Did your uncle Al ever write anythin' about a man named Beasley?” asked Dale.  “Indeed he did,” replied Helen, with a start of surprise. “Beasley! That name is familiar to us--and detestable. My uncle complained of this man for years. Then he grew bitter--accused Beasley. But the last year or so not a word!”  “Well, now,” began the hunter, earnestly, “let's get the bad news over. I'm sorry you must be worried. But you must learn to take the West as it is. There's good an' bad, maybe more bad. That's because the country's young.... So to come right out with it--this Beasley hired a gang of outlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to Snowdrop--to-morrow--an' to make off with you.”  “Make off with me?” ejaculated Helen, bewildered.  “Kidnap you! Which, in that gang, would be worse than killing you!”  declared Dale, grimly, and he closed a huge fist on his knee.  Helen was utterly astounded.  “How hor-rible!” she gasped out. “Make off with me!... What in Heaven's name for?”  Bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance.  “For reasons you ought to guess,” replied Dale, and he leaned forward again. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there was a something about him that fascinated Helen. “I'm a hunter. I live in the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm an' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses. I hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They couldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson an' his gang of sheep-thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there. Pretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his last legs--how he had sent for you to have his property when he died. Beasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get you out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With Al dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he wouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late.... Well, they rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're all my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I didn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an' for that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides Beasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me because he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men. Then we fell out--or he fell out--because he believed a tame lion of mine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have done it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but old Al wouldn't listen. He's cross--very cross. An' when I tried to tell him, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I reckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four friends I could trust. They're Mormon boys--brothers. That's Joe out on top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked them to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena. It happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine. An' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends here--Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage.... An' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at Helen and then at Bo.  “You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her fingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.  Dale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased. A smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet slightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation held her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of admiration and gratitude.  “So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder you're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'.... Now we've thirty miles to ride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To-day sometime the rest of the boys--Roy, John, an' Hal--were to leave Show Down, which's a town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides their own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them--to-night, maybe--or tomorrow. I hope not to-night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was ridin' in to Magdalena.”  Helen wrung her hands helplessly.  “Oh, have I no courage?” she whispered.  “Nell, I'm as scared as you are,” said Bo, consolingly, embracing her sister.  “I reckon that's natural,” said Dale, as if excusing them. “But, scared or not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An' you'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena, or anywhere else, except your uncle's.”  “Mr.--Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me a coward--or--or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so--so shocked. After all we hoped and expected--this--this--is such a--a terrible surprise.”  “Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,” murmured Bo.  “That's the talk,” said Dale. “You see, I've come right out with the worst. Maybe we'll get through easy. When we meet the boys we'll take to the horses an' the trails. Can you ride?”  “Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well,”  responded Helen. The idea of riding quickened her "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34579"],["title","Bees from British Guiana (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                _Bees from British Guiana_                          BY T.

In connection with the work of the Tropical Research Station of the New York Zoological Society, conducted by Mr. William Beebe, collections of insects, including bees, were made. The present report deals with a series of bees from the Bartica District, and Mr. John Tee Van, in forwarding them, states that \"almost all of these bees were procured about a clump of several species of nightshades (_Solanum_), which were flowering in thinned-out jungle.\" I give an artificial key, which will enable one who is not a specialist in bees to separate readily each species from the rest. It will, of course, remain necessary to compare any species with a fuller account to make sure that it is not some form unrepresented in the present collection. The types of the new species and varieties from British Guiana are deposited in The American Museum of Natural History. Species marked P. are from the Penal Settlement; those marked K. occur at Kalacoon.        The body, or some part of it, brilliant green                   1.
