These city poultry keepers often give a great deal of time to their fowls and still either lose money on them or make very small wages for the time given to this work, because they try to keep too many in a small space, or to keep more than they have time to care for properly.  [Illustration: Fig. 23. Black Langshan hen. (Photograph from Urban Farms, Buffalo, New York)]  The breeding of fancy fowls is also an important pursuit. Those who engage in this line on a large scale locate on farms, but many of the smaller breeders live in towns, and the greater number of the amateur fanciers who breed fine fowls for pleasure are city people.  On large poultry farms the work is usually done by men. There are many small plants operated by women. The ordinary farm and family flocks are cared for by women and children much oftener than by men, because, even when the men are interested in poultry, other work takes the farmer away from the vicinity of the house, and the city man away from home, so much that they cannot look after poultry as closely as is necessary to get the best results. Many women like to have the care of a small flock of fowls, because it takes them outdoors for a few minutes at intervals every day, and the eggs and poultry sold may bring in a considerable amount of pin money. Many boys, while attending the grammar and high schools, earn money by keeping a flock of fowls. Some have saved enough in this way to pay expenses at college for a year or more, or to give them a start in a small business. When there are both boys and girls in a family, such outdoor work usually falls to the lot of a boy. A girl can do just as well if she has the opportunity and takes an interest in the work.  [Illustration: Fig. 24. Pit Game cock. (Photograph from W. F. Liedtke, Meriden, Connecticut)]  =Native fowls in America.= To appreciate the influence of improved races of fowls from various parts of the Old World upon the development of poultry culture in America, we must know what the fowls in this country were like when poultry keepers here began to see the advantages of keeping better stock, and must learn something of the history of the improved races in the countries from which they came.  [Illustration: Fig. 25. Dominique cockerel. (Photograph from W. H. Davenport, Coleraine, Massachusetts)]  When we speak of native fowls in America we mean fowls derived from the stocks brought here by the early settlers. The fowl was not known in the Western Hemisphere until it was brought here by Europeans. Britain, France, Spain, Holland, and Sweden all sent colonists to America, and from each of these countries came, no doubt, some of the ordinary fowls of that country. Perhaps improved varieties came from some of these lands in early colonial times, but the only breeds that retained their identity sufficiently to have distinctive names were the Game Fowls, which came mostly from England, and the Dominiques (bluish-gray barred fowls which probably came from Holland or from the north of France, where fowls of this type were common).  [Illustration: Fig. 26. Dominique hen. (Photograph from Skerritt and Son, Utica, New York)]  The Game Fowls, being prized for the sport of cockfighting, were often bred with great care, but the Dominique fowls (also called cuckoo fowls and hawk-colored fowls) were mixed with other stock, and the name was commonly given to any fowl of that color, until after the improvement of fowls began. Then some people collected flocks of fowls of this color and bred them for uniformity in other characters. Well-bred fowls, however, were comparatively rare. Most of the stock all through the country was of the little mongrel type until about the middle of the last century. Then that type began to disappear from New England, New York, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. It remained longer in the Northern states west of the Allegheny Mountains and a generation ago was still the most common type in the upper Mississippi Valley. It is now unknown outside of the Southern states, and within ten or twenty years it will disappear entirely.  [Illustration: Fig. 27. Silver-Gray Dorking cock]  [Illustration: Fig. 28. Silver-Gray Dorking hen]  =Old European races of fowls.= With the exception of the Leghorn, most of the distinct breeds of European origin were brought from England, and the types introduced were not the types as developed in the places where the breeds (other than English breeds) originated, but those types as modified by English fanciers. In America, again, most of these breeds have been slightly changed to conform to the ideas of American fanciers. So, while the breed characters are still the same as in the original stocks, the pupil looking at birds of these breeds to-day must not suppose that it was just such birds that came to this country from seventy to a hundred years ago, or that, if he went to the countries where those races originated, he would find birds just like those he had seen at home. Except in the case of the distinctly English breeds, such as the Dorking and the Cornish Indian Game, which are bred to greater perfection in their native land than elsewhere, he would find most of the European races not so highly developed in the countries where they originated as in England and America, where fanciers are more numerous.

(Photograph from H. J. Fisk, Falconer, New York)]  =Italian fowls.= Strictly speaking, the Italian fowls in Italy are not an improved race. The fowl which is known in this country as the Leghorn fowl (because the first specimens brought here came from the port of Leghorn) is the common fowl of Italy and has changed very little since it was introduced into that country thousands of years ago. It is found there in all colors, and mostly with a single comb. The Italian type is of particular interest, not only because of its influence in modern times, but because from it were probably derived most of the other European races. Italian fowls were first brought to this country about 1835, but did not attract popular attention until twenty-five or thirty years later.  [Illustration: Fig. 31. Silver-Spangled Hamburg cock[3]]  [Illustration: Fig. 32. Silver-Spangled Hamburg hen[3]]  [3] Photograph from Dr. J. S. Wolfe, Bloomfield, New Jersey.  =English races of fowls.= It is supposed that fowls were introduced into Britain from Italy shortly after the Roman conquest. The type was probably very like that of ordinary Leghorn fowls of our own time, but with smaller combs. From such stock the English developed two very different races, the Pit Game and the Dorking. Game fowls were bred in all parts of the kingdom, but the Dorkings were a local breed developed by the people in the vicinity of the town of Dorking, where from very early times the growing of poultry for the London market was an important local industry. Each in its way, these two breeds represent the highest skill in breeding. In the Old English Game Fowl, symmetry, strength, endurance, and courage were combined to perfection. The Dorking is the finest type of table fowl that has ever been produced.  [Illustration: Fig. 33. White-Crested Black Polish cock[4]]  [Illustration: Fig. 34. White-Crested Black Polish hen[4]]  [4] Photograph from Charles L. Seely, Afton, New York.  =German and Dutch races.= The breeds now known as Hamburgs and Polish are of peculiar interest to a student of the evolution of races of fowls, because they present some characters not readily derived from the primitive type of the fowl. The feather markings of some varieties of both these breeds are unlike those of other races, and are markings which would not be likely to become established unless the fowls were bred systematically for that purpose. So, too, with the large crest of the Polish fowl: to carry it the structure of the head must be changed. Such changes require systematic breeding for a long period. Dutch and German artists of the sixteenth century painted many farmyard scenes showing fowls of both these types, frequently in flocks with common fowls and with some that appear to be a mixture. To any one versed in the breeding of poultry this indicates that these peculiar types had been made by very skillful breeders long before. The most reasonable supposition is that these breeders were monks in the monasteries of Central Europe. Throughout the Middle Ages the monks of Europe, more than any other class of men, worked for improvement in agriculture as well as for the advancement of learning.  [Illustration: Fig. 35. Houdan cock. (Photograph from the Houdan Yards, Sewickley, Pennsylvania)]  [Illustration: Fig. 36. White Minorca hen. (Photograph from Tioga Poultry Farm, Apalachin, New York)]  =French races.= The Houdan is the only French breed well known in America. It is of the Polish type, but heavier, and the plumage is mottled irregularly, not distinctly marked as in the party-colored varieties of Polish. The breed takes its name from the town of Houdan, the center of a district in which this is the common type of fowl.  =Spanish races.= The fowls of Spanish origin well known outside of Spain are the White-faced Black Spanish, the Black Minorca, and the Blue Andalusian. The fowls of Spain at the present time are mostly of the Italian type, with black (or in some districts blue) the predominant color. The Black Spanish seems to have been known in Holland and England for two hundred years or more. In Spain the white face is but moderately developed. The monstrous exaggeration of this character began in Holland and was carried to the extreme by British fanciers who admired it.  [Illustration: Fig. 37. Black Minorca cock.

GALBREATH   Heretofore our knowledge of the osteology of _Heliscomys_ Cope has been extremely limited; this genus previously was known by its teeth, fragmental maxillaries, incomplete palatine bone and mandible, and part of one forelimb. In the summer of 1946 the writer, as a member of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History field party, discovered the anterior part of a skull of _Heliscomys_ in the middle Oligocene deposits of Logan County, Colorado. This specimen, representing a new species, yields a welcome, and greatly desired addition to our fund of information about the genus.  The writer is indebted to Dr. Robert W. Wilson for advice and helpful criticism in the course of this study, and to Mr. Bryan Patterson of the Chicago Natural History Museum for the loan of comparative material. Mrs. Bernita Mansfield of the Geology Department, University of Kansas, prepared the plates.   Family HETEROMYIDAE  ~Heliscomys tenuiceps~, new species  _Holotype._--Anterior part of a skull with left P4-M3, No. 7702, Vertebrate Paleontological Collection, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas.  _Geological Age and locality._--Silts of Orellan age in the Cedar Creek facies of the Brule formation in \"Chimney Canyon,\" Sec. 3, T. 11 N, R. 54 W, Logan County, Colorado.  _Diagnosis._--Size larger than any known species; P4 with posteroexternal cusp (metacone) anterior to central (hypocone) and lingual (entostyle) cusps, which are connected by a cingulum; internal cingula of molars undivided, and as high as paracone and metacone; style of each cingulum opposite the straight median valley; rostrum deep and laterally compressed.  _Description._--The type consists of the preorbital and interorbital parts of a skull. Its size is comparable to that of the Recent heteromyid, _Liomys pictus_ Merriam. _L. pictus_ is the species referred to in the comparisons below when only the generic name _Liomys_ is mentioned. Both incisors have been broken off. The right tooth-row is missing, but the left row is complete, and its orientation indicates that the tooth rows were parallel. The zygomata are broken off close to the rostrum, which is relatively narrow in comparison with its length and depth. In this narrowness, the specimen resembles _Florentiamys_ Wood more than it does such Recent heteromyids as _Liomys_ or _Heteromys_, where the rostrum is much wider at the dorsal surface than at the ventral surface (correlating with the wide interorbital dimension). In No. 7702 the rostrum is not appreciably expanded on the dorsal surface. The wide interorbital dimension also gives a tapering appearance to the rostrum of the Recent heteromyids, when viewed dorsally, which is not seen in the fossil specimen. Like those of most heteromyids, the nasals and premaxillaries project forward beyond the incisors.  _H. tenuiceps_ has a distinctly heteromyidlike appearance, and it is obvious that the features of the anterior part of the skull, which characterize the heteromyids, had been established by middle Oligocene time.  The nasal bone extends caudad as far as does the premaxillary; they terminate at the anterior border of the orbit. The nasal is widest anteriorly where it curves downward on the side to meet the anterior projection of the premaxillary bone beyond the incisor. Posteriorly, the two nasals have practically parallel lateral borders much as in _Liomys_.  The frontal bone dorsally is relatively narrower than in any Recent heteromyid, and closely resembles that of the geomyids. There is a slight depression in the midline of the skull where the two frontals unite, but no evidence of a ridge for the attachment of the temporal muscle. In lateral view, the ledge seen in _Liomys_ at the dorsal surface is absent, nor is this surface rounded as in _Geomys_. Preservation around the nasolacrimal canal is poor, but traces of sutures indicate that the frontal bone is not involved in the posteromedial wall of that canal. The orbital plate is broad, comparatively flat, and extends farther ventrad than in _Liomys_, and enters into the composition of the sphenopalatine foramina. Ventrally the frontal bone meets the orbital processes of the palatine and maxillary bones, and posterolaterally meets the orbitosphenoid.  In the anterodorsal angle of the rim of the orbit the lacrimal bone rests against the frontal and maxillary bones, where the body of the lacrimal contributes to the formation of the posteromedial wall of the nasolacrimal canal. Only a slight part of the maxillary process of the lacrimal remains on each side.  The premaxillary bone, which constitutes most of the anterior part of the rostrum, is typically heteromyid in shape. The frontal process is long and slender. On the side of the rostrum the premaxillary forms the anterointernal border of the infraorbital foramen. The ventrolateral border of the bone is expanded slightly and aids in the formation of the tuberosity made by the maxillary bone at the ventroposterior border of the foramen. Ventrally the premaxillary makes up the anterior two-thirds of the lateral wall of the incisive (anterior palatine) foramen. It is not possible to establish what part of the median septum between the foramina is made up of premaxillary bones. The incisor arches through the premaxillary in a manner similar to that in _Liomys_, with the upper wall of the root canal being formed by the upper surface of the bone. Due to the narrowness of the rostrum, the root of the incisor is prominently outlined on the side of the rostrum, both in the premaxillary and maxillary bones. With this modeling of the side of the rostrum because of the incisor root canal, and the flaring of the posterior and ventral edges of the infraorbital foramen, the side wall of the premaxillary appears as a depressed area. Anterior to the incisor root the tip of the premaxillary projects forward, and parallels its opposite, laterally, instead of turning inward as in _Liomys_. This condition, together with the prominence of the root canal, makes the anterior tip project as a flange. The premaxillary extends downward as a plate of bone, and embraces the posterior and lateral sides of the incisor as in Recent heteromyids. The interpremaxillary foramen, if present, is obscure. However, there appears to be a foramen posterior to the incisor, which possibly has taken over the function of the interpremaxillary foramen.  Both maxillary bones are incomplete, and lack the zygomatic processes. The rostral part of the maxillary is compressed laterally, as is the premaxillary. The anterior border of the maxillary contributes to the formation of the border of the anterior opening of the infraorbital canal where, at the posteroventral border of the opening, the bone is produced into a prominent tuberosity which projects laterally approximately one millimeter on each side. The infraorbital foramen (anterior opening of the infraorbital canal) lies about midway between the anterior end of the skull and the root of the zygoma. High on each side of the rostrum, and beneath the dorsal edge of the masseteric plate, is an area containing small foramina. The zygomasseteric plate is inclined forward at the dorsal end, and extends anteriorly almost to the highest part of the arch of the canal for the root of the incisor. The posterior end of the infraorbital canal lies on the median side of the zygomatic root as it does in _H. hatcheri_ Wood. Ventrally the zygomatic root rises above the fourth premolar as in _H. gregoryi_ Wood, _H. hatcheri_, and in Recent heteromyids. The ventral part of the orbit, containing the sphenopalatine foramen, presphenoid foramen, and the sphenoidal fissure, is not constricted as in _Liomys_, but is open like that of the squirrels. This condition is emphasized by the narrowness of the interorbital part of the skull and the more vertical position of the orbital plate.  The alisphenoid bone is large and forms part of the posteromedial wall of the orbit. The sphenofrontal foramen lies in the suture between the extreme anterior margin of this bone and the frontal bone.  The orbitosphenoid bone makes up little of the orbital wall. It occupies the posterior area of the orbit between the alisphenoid and palatine, and is in contact with these bones and the frontal. The presphenoid canal between the orbits is large, and the entrance at each end is well separated from the"]]]
