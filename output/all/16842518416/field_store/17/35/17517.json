Fresh supplies of air enter _B_ by _C_.   =Blow-pipe Flames=--_The Pointed Flame._--If the gas tap of a Herapath blow-pipe be adjusted so that comparatively little gas can pass, and if the foot-blower be then worked cautiously, a long tongue of flame ending in a fine point will be produced (Fig. 3). This flame will subsequently be described as the _pointed flame_. It should be quite free from luminosity, and as the amount of air necessary for securing a pointed flame is large, in proportion to the gas, there is excess of oxygen towards the end _C_. By adjusting the proportions of air and gas, pointed flames of various dimensions can be obtained with the same blow-pipe. The part of a pointed flame to be used in glass-working is the tip, or in some cases the space slightly beyond the tip.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  _The Brush Flame._--If a large supply of gas be turned on and a considerable blast of air sent into the flame, a non-luminous flame of great size will be obtained (Fig. 4). In form it somewhat resembles a large camel's hair pencil, and may conveniently be described as a _brush flame_. The chief advantage of a large-sized blow-pipe is, that with it a large brush flame may be produced, which is often invaluable. By gradually diminishing the supply of gas and air smaller brush flames may be produced.  The jet used to supply air to the Herapath blow-pipe is usually too fine, and consequently does not permit the passage of sufficient air to produce a brush flame that contains excess of oxygen, even with the aid of a very powerful blower. My own Herapath blow-pipe only gives a satisfactory oxidising brush flame when the jet is removed altogether from the end of the air-tube. For producing pointed flames the finer jet of the air-tube must be used, but when a highly oxidising flame of large size is required it must be removed. The internal diameter of the central air-tube should be nearly half as great as that of the outer or gas-supply tube. Fletcher's Automaton with the large air jet gives a very liberal supply of air, and produces an excellent oxidising brush flame. In the case of the larger-sized Automaton a consequence of this is, however, that when fitted with the large jet it will not give so good a pointed flame as the Herapath, which, in its turn, gives an inferior oxidising brush. By fitting finer jets to the air-tube of Fletcher's apparatus pointed flames can be secured when necessary.  _The Smoky Flame._--By turning on a very free supply of gas, and only enough air to give an outward direction to the burning gas, a smoky flame, chiefly useful for annealing and for some simple operations on lead glass, is produced.  The Gimmingham blow-pipe and Fletcher's combination blow-pipe, in addition to the above flames, are also adapted to produce a non-luminous flame, resembling that of the Bunsen gas-burner, which is very convenient for the preliminary heating of the glass, and also for gradually cooling finished apparatus. It is not necessary to describe the method of using these last-mentioned blow-pipes. With the more complicated of them directions for its use are supplied.  Mr. Madan has suggested the use of oxygen in place of air for producing the oxidising flame required for working lead glass, and to produce a flame of high temperature for softening tubes of hard, or combustion, glass. For the latter purpose the employment of oxygen may be adopted with great advantage. For working lead glass, however, it is quite unnecessary if the directions already given are followed.  The student's subsequent success will so largely depend upon his acquaintance with the resources of his blow-pipe, and on the facility with which he can take advantage of them, that no pains should be spared in the effort to become expert in its management as soon as possible. A few experiments should now be made, therefore, upon the adjustment of the flame, until the student is able to produce and modify any form of flame with promptness and certainty.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  The remaining apparatus used in glass-working consists of triangular and other files, charcoal pastils for cutting glass, pieces of sound charcoal of various diameters with conical ends; it is convenient to have one end somewhat less pointed than the other (Fig. 5). Corks of various sizes; the smallest, which are most frequently needed, should be carefully cut with sharpened cork borers from larger corks. Besides these there should be provided some freshly distilled turpentine in which camphor has been dissolved,[1] fine and coarse emery powder, and some sheets of cotton-wadding, an india-rubber blowing-bottle, glass tubes, a little white enamel, and a pair of iron tongs.  [1] Half an ounce of camphor to about six ounces of turpentine will do very well.     CHAPTER II.  _VARIETIES OF GLASS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT._   All the varieties of glass that are ordinarily met with contain silica (SiO_{2}) associated with metallic oxides. In a true glass there are at least two metallic oxides. The unmixed silicates are not suitable for the purposes of glass. They are not so capable of developing the viscous condition when heated as mixtures--some of them are easily attacked by water, and many of those which are insoluble are comparatively infusible. There is generally excess of silica in glass, that is, more than is necessary to form normal silicates of the metals present. The best proportions of the various constituents have been ascertained by glass-makers, after long experience; but the relation of these proportions to each other, from a chemical point of view, is not easy to make out.  The varieties of glass from which tubes for chemical glass-blowing are made may be placed under three heads, and are known as[2]--    Soft soda glass.   Also known as French glass.   Lead glass.        Also known as English glass.   Hard glass.  [2] For details of the composition of the various glasses, some work on glass-making may be consulted.  In purchasing glass tubes, it is well to lay in a considerable stock of tubes made of each of the two first varieties, and, if possible, to obtain them from the manufacturer, for it frequently happens that pieces of glass from the same batch may be much more readily welded together than pieces of slightly different composition. Yet it is not well to lay in too large a stock, as sometimes it is found that glass deteriorates by prolonged keeping.  As it is frequently necessary to make additions, alterations, or repairs to purchased apparatus, it is best to provide supplies both of soft soda glass and lead glass, for though purchased glass apparatus is frequently made of lead glass, yet sometimes it is formed from the soda glass, and as it is a matter of some difficulty to effect a permanent union between soda glass and lead glass, it is desirable to be provided with tubes of both kinds.  Many amateurs find that soda glass is in some respects easier to work with than lead glass. But, on the other hand, it is somewhat more apt to crack during cooling, which causes much loss of time and disappointment. Also, perhaps in consequence of its lower conductivity for heat, it very often breaks under sudden changes of temperature during work. If, however, a supply of good soda glass is obtained, and the directions given in this book in regard to annealing it are thoroughly carried out, these objections to the use of soda glass will, to a great extent, be removed. I find, however, that when every precaution has been taken, apparatus made of soda glass will bear variations of temperature less well than that made of lead glass. Therefore, although the comparatively inexpensive soda glass may be employed for most purposes without distrust, yet I should advise those who propose to confine themselves to one kind of glass, to take the small extra trouble required in learning to work lead glass.  In order to secure glass of good quality, a few pieces should be obtained as a sample, and examined by the directions given below. When the larger supply arrives, a number of pieces, taken at random, should be examined before the blow-pipe, to compare their behaviour with that of the sample pieces, and each piece should be separately examined in all other respects as described subsequently.  Hard glass is used for apparatus that is required to withstand great heat. It is difficult to soften, especially in large pieces. It should only be employed, therefore, when the low melting points of soda or lead glass would render them unsuitable for the purpose to which the finished apparatus is to be put. What is sold as Jena combustion tube should be preferred when this is the case.   =Characters of good Glass.=--Glass tubes for glass-blowing should be as free as possible from knots, air-bubbles, and stripes. They should be in straight pieces of uniform thickness, and cylindrical bore. It is not possible to obtain glass tubes of absolutely the same diameter from one end to the other in large quantities, but the variations should not be considerable.  When a sharp transverse scratch is made with a good file on a piece of tube, and the scratch is touched with a rather fine point of red-hot glass (this should be lead glass for a lead glass tube, and soda glass for a tube of soda glass), the crack which is started should pass round the glass, so that it may be broken into two pieces with regular ends. If the crack proceeds very irregularly, and especially if it tends to extend along the tube, the glass has been badly annealed, and should not be employed for glass-blowing purposes. It is important that the point of hot glass used shall be very small, however. Even good glass will frequently give an irregular fracture if touched with a large mass of molten glass.  Finally, glass tube which is thin and of small diameter should not crack when suddenly brought into a flame. But larger and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],["title","The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#3)"],["body","tubes will not often withstand this treatment. They should not crack, however, when they are brought into a flame gradually, after having been held in the warm air in front of it for a minute or so.  Good glass does not readily devitrify when held in the blow-pipe flame. As devitrified glass very often may be restored to its vitreous condition by fusion, devitrification most frequently shows itself round the edges of the heated parts, and may be recognised by the production of a certain degree of roughness there. It is believed to be due to the separation of certain silicates in the crystallised form. Hard glass, which contains much calcium, is more apt to devitrify than the more fusible varieties.[3]  [3] The presence of silicates of calcium and aluminum are considered to promote a tendency to devitrification in glass; and glasses of complex composition are more apt to devitrify than the simpler varieties. See _Glass-making_, by Powell, Chance, and Harris, Chap. IV.  Glass tubes are made of various sizes. When purchasing a supply, it is necessary to be somewhat precise in indicating to the vendor the sizes required. I have therefore placed at the end of the book, in an appendix, a table of numbered diagrams. In ordering tubes it will usually only be necessary to give the numbers of the sizes wished for, and to specify the quantity of each size required. In ordering glass tubes by weight, it must be remembered that a great many lengths of the smaller sizes, but very few lengths of the larger sizes, go to the pound. Larger-sized tubes than those on the diagram are also made. In ordering them the external diameter and thickness of glass preferred should be stated.   =Cleaning and Preparing a Tube.=--It is frequently much easier to clean the tube from which a piece of apparatus is to be made than to clean the finished apparatus. A simple method of cleaning a tube is to draw a piece of wet rag which has been tied to a string through the tube once or twice, or, with small tubes, to push a bit of wet paper or cotton wool through them. If the dirt cannot be removed in this way, the interior of the tube should be moistened with a little sulphuric acid in which some bichromate of potassium has been dissolved. In any case, it must finally be repeatedly rinsed with distilled water, and dried by cautiously warming it, and sucking or blowing air through it. In order to avoid heating delicate apparatus which has become damp and needs drying, the water may be washed out with a few drops of spirit, which is readily removed at a low temperature.  Before using a glass tube for an operation in which it will be necessary to blow into it, one end of it must be contracted, unless it is already of such a size that it can be held between the lips with perfect ease; in any case, its edges must be rounded. For descriptions of these operations, see page 35. The other end must be closed. This may be done by means of a cork.   =Presenting Glass to the Flame.=--Glass tubes must never be brought suddenly into the flame in which they are to be heated. All glass is very likely to crack if so treated. It should in all cases be held for a little while in front of the flame, rotated constantly in the hot air and moved about, in order that it may be warmed over a considerable area. When it has become pretty hot by this treatment, it may be gradually brought nearer to the flame, and, finally, into contact with it, still with constant rotation and movement, so as to warm a considerable part of the tube. When the glass has been brought fairly into contact with the flame, it will be safe to apply the heat at the required part only. Care must be taken in these preliminary operations to avoid heating the more fusible glasses sufficiently to soften them.   =Methods of working with Lead and soft Soda Glass respectively.=--When lead glass is heated in the brush flame of the ordinary Herapath blow-pipe, or within the point of the pointed flame, it becomes blackened on its surface, in consequence of a portion of the lead becoming reduced to the metallic state by the reducing gases in the flame. The same thing will happen in bending a lead glass tube if it is made too hot in a luminous flame. A practical acquaintance with this phenomenon may be acquired by the following experiment:--  Take a piece of lead glass tube, bring it gradually from the point of a pointed flame to a position well within the flame, and observe what happens. When the glass reaches the point _A_ (Fig. 3), or thereabouts, a dark red spot will develop on the glass, the area of the spot will increase as the glass is brought further in the direction _A_ to _B_. If the glass be then removed from the flame and examined, it will be found that a dark metallic stain covers the area of the dark red spot previously observed. Repeat the experiment, but at the first appearance of the dark spot slowly move the glass in the direction _A_ to _C_. The spot will disappear, and, if the operation be properly performed, in its place there will be a characteristically greenish-yellow luminous spot of highly heated glass. In this proceeding the reduced lead of the dark spot has been re-oxidised on passing into the hot gases, rich in oxygen, which abound at the point of the flame. If one end of the tube has been previously closed by a piece of cork, and if air be forced into the tube with the mouth from the open end before the luminous spot has become cool, the glass will expand. If the experiment be repeated several times, with pointed flames of various sizes, the operator will quickly learn how to apply the pointed flame to lead glass so that it may be heated without becoming stained with reduced lead.  If the spot of reduced metal produced in the first experiment be next brought into the oxidising flame, it also may gradually be removed. On occasion, therefore, apparatus which has become stained with lead during its production, may be rendered presentable by suitable treatment in the oxidising flame. The process of re-oxidising a considerable surface in this way after it has cooled down is apt to be very tedious, however, and, especially in the case of thin tubes or bulbs, often is not practicable. In working with lead glass, therefore, any reduction that occurs should be removed by transferring the glass to the oxidising flame at once.  Small tubes, and small areas on larger tubes of English glass, may be softened without reduction by means of the pointed oxidising flame; but it is not easy to heat any considerable area of glass sufficiently with a pointed flame. And though it is possible, with care, to employ the hot space immediately in front of the visible end of an ordinary brush flame, which is rich in air, yet, in practice, it will not be found convenient to heat large masses of lead glass nor tubes of large size, to a sufficiently high temperature to get the glass into good condition for blowing, by presenting them to the common brush flame.  It may seem that as glass which has become stained with reduced lead can be subsequently re-oxidised by heating it with the tip of the pointed flame, the difficulty might be overcome by heating it for working in the brush flame, and subsequently oxidising the reduced lead. It is, however, difficult, as previously stated, to re-oxidise a large surface of glass which has been seriously reduced by the action of the reducing gases of the flame, after it has cooled. Moreover, there is this very serious objection, that if, as may be necessary, the action of the reducing flame be prolonged, the extensive reduction that takes place diminishes the tendency of the glass to acquire the proper degree of viscosity for working it, the glass becomes difficult to expand by blowing, seriously roughened on its surface, and often assumes a very brittle or rotten condition.  When it is only required to bend or draw out tubes of lead glass, they may be softened sufficiently by a smoky flame, which, probably owing to its having a comparatively low temperature, does not so readily reduce the lead as flames of higher temperature. But for making joints, collecting masses of glass for making bulbs, and in all cases where it is required that the glass shall be thoroughly softened, the smoky flame does not give good results.  In the glass-works, where large quantities of ornamental and other glass goods are made of lead or flint glass, the pots in which the glass is melted are so constructed that the gases of the furnace do not come into contact with the glass;[4] and as the intensely-heated sides of the melting-pot maintain a very high temperature within it by radiation, the workman has a very convenient source of heat to his hand,--he has, in fact, only to introduce the object, or that part of it which is to be softened, into the mouth of the melting-pot, and it is quickly heated sufficiently for his purpose, not only without contact of reducing gases, but in air. He can therefore easily work upon very large masses of glass. In a special case, such a source of heat might be devised by the amateur. Usually, however, the difficulty may be overcome without special apparatus. It is, in fact, only necessary to carry out the instructions given below to obtain a considerable brush flame rich in air, in which the lead glass can be worked, not only without discoloration, but with the greatest facility.  [4] See _Principles of Glass-making_, p. 31.  _To Produce an Oxidising Brush Flame._--The blower used must be powerful, the air-tube of the blow-pipe must be about half as great in diameter as the outer tube which supplies the gas. The operator must work his bellows so as to supply a strong and _steady_ blast of air, and the supply of gas must be regulated so that the brush flame produced is free from every sign of incomplete combustion,[5] which may be known by its outer zone being only faintly visible in daylight, and quite free from luminous streaks (see Fig. 4, p. 9).
