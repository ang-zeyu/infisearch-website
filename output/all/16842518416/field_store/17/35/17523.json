DUELLMAN   Biological exploration of México and Central America has revealed the presence of a diverse fauna, elements of which have undergone speciation in separate areas within the relatively small region. Some genera of amphibians, especially _Eleutherodactylus_ and _Hyla_, are represented by many species having small geographic ranges in México and Central America. Most of the species of _Hyla_ inhabiting the lowlands have been known to science for many years, and most of the novelties today are found in the less accessible highlands. No fewer than 19 new species of hylid frogs have been discovered and named from México and Central America in the past decade.  In the spring and summer of 1966 I studied hylid frogs in many parts of southern México and Central America; the field work was designed to obtain specimens and data that would resolve certain systematic problems. To a certain extent the studies were successful, but in the course of the work five previously unknown hylids were discovered; these are named and described in this paper. The only species described herein that I do not know in life is one of _Plectrohyla_ that has been represented in museum collections for several years but was not obtained in my own field work.  In this paper I am presenting diagnoses, descriptions, and brief comments on the relationships of five new species and one subspecies. More exhaustive accounts will be included in a monograph, now in preparation, on the Middle American hylids.  For use of comparative material used in the preparation of this paper, I am indebted to Richard J. Baldauf, Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection (TCWC); Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); James A. Peters, United States National Museum (USNM); Hobart M. Smith, University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Charles F. Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); and Ernest E. Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). KU refers to the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. I am especially grateful for help in obtaining specimens and data to Linda Trueb, who accompanied me throughout México and Central America, where we were joined by John D. Lynch in Costa Rica and Charles W. Myers in Panamá. Linda Trueb offered helpful suggestions in the course of preparing the manuscript, and David M. Dennis skillfully prepared the illustrations which more accurately depict the frogs than my written descriptions; both of these persons have my thanks for their contributions.  Ratibor Hartmann of Finca Santa Clara, Chiriquí, Panamá, made possible our travels to the Río Changena on the Atlantic slopes of Bocas del Toro. Field work in Costa Rica was facilitated by the Organization of Tropical Studies through the courtesy of Stephen B. Preston and Norman Scott. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo of the Dirección General de la Fauna Silvestre provided the necessary permits to collect in México. I thank each of these persons for his helpfulness and cooperation.  Field work in México and Central America and the associated laboratory studies on Middle American hylid frogs are supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (GB-1441 and GB-5818). The field work in Panamá was part of a survey of the herpetofauna of that country carried out in cooperation with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory and supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM-12020).

From all of these, _xanthosticta_ differs by having large yellow spots on the flanks and thighs, a white labial stripe, and a large yellow spot on the proximal ventral surface of each thigh. Females of _Hyla pictipes_ have small creamy yellow spots on the flanks and thighs but have dark spots on the venter; furthermore, _pictipes_ lacks white stripes on the upper lip and above the anus, lacks a canthal stripe, and has larger discs and less webbing on the hand. _Hyla tica_ differs from _xanthosticta_ by having white mottling on the flanks, dark transverse bands on the limbs, and larger discs, and lacks yellow spots on the thighs, and white stripes on the upper lip, limbs, and above the anus. _Hyla rivularis_ is notably different in having a tan dorsum and creamy yellow venter with black flecks; moreover, _rivularis_ lacks spots on the flanks and thighs and white stripes on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33967"],["title","Descriptions of New Hylid Frogs From Mexico and Central America (#1)"],["body","upper lip, limbs, and above the anus. Of all of the species in the _pictipes_ group, _xanthosticta_ most closely resembles _debilis_. This species has a dull green dorsum, usually flecked with brown or black, and a creamy white venter. The flanks of _debilis_ are creamy white with small brown flecks, and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are bright yellow. _Hyla debilis_ has a dull tan canthal stripe and white spots on the upper lip; the webbing on the hand is slightly more extensive, and the discs are slightly larger, in _debilis_ than in _xanthosticta_.  The presence of the large yellow spots on the flanks and thighs in combination with the uniformly green dorsum and yellow venter immediately distinguishes _Hyla xanthosticta_ from all other known species of Middle American hylids.  _Remarks._--The only known specimen of _Hyla xanthosticta_ was perched at night on a leaf about one meter above the ground. The frog was found in humid upper montane forest characterized by large oaks supporting many bromeliads and heavy growths of mosses. Two other members of the _Hyla pictipes_ group--_pictipes_ and _rivularis_--were abundant along a stream in the oak forest.  The specific name is derived from the Greek _xanthos_ meaning yellow and the Greek _stiktos_ meaning spotted, and alludes to the diagnostic yellow spots on the flanks and thighs.

Skin of belly, ventral surfaces of arms, and proximal posteroventral surfaces of thighs granular, elsewhere smooth. Tongue ovoid, about twice as long as wide, shallowly notched posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 5-6, situated on transverse ridges between posterior borders of small round choanae. Vocal slit extending from midlateral edge of tongue to angle of jaw.  Color (in preservative): dorsum grayish tan with large brown blotch extending from eyelids to middle of back, limbs marked with brown transverse bars, 2 on each forearm, 3 on each thigh, shank, and foot. Flanks dark gray with white spots; groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of shanks, and inner edges of feet orange-tan; anal region dark brown, bordered above by white stripe; belly and chin creamy white, latter with grayish brown flecks.  Color (in life): dorsum yellowish tan with olive-brown markings by night and uniform pale yellowish tan by day; axilla, inner surface of elbow, groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of thighs and shanks, inner surfaces of feet, and dorsal surfaces of first three toes tomato red; flanks dark blue with yellow spots and reticulations. Throat, chest, and anterior part of belly creamy white; posterior part of belly orange, becoming red in extreme posterior region; throat flecked with brown; iris pale bronze with black reticulations; palpebral membrane clear above, yellowish tan below; nuptial excrescenses dark brown.  _Variation._--The discussion of variation is based on the type series plus 31 specimens (KU 101781-811) from the Río Claro near its junction with the Río Changena, at an elevation of 910 meters. Females are slightly larger than males, but do not differ significantly in proportions (Table 1). All specimens have the diagnostic red legs and blue flanks with yellow spots or mottling, but the dorsal pattern is highly variable. In most individuals the dark markings on the dorsum are a solid color, but in some the borders of the marks are dark, and the interior of each mark is nearly the same color as the rest of the dorsum. A triangular dark mark with the anterolateral corners on the eyelids is present in all specimens. In some individuals the posteriorly directed apex of this triangular mark is connected to the apex of another triangular mark on the back; in other individuals the marks are narrowly separated, whereas in a few specimens the marks are broadly connected. A dark blotch usually is present on the posterior end of the body. One specimen (KU 101771) has many small white spots on the dorsum. The white stripe above the anus is invariably present, and the transverse bars on the limbs are present in all specimens, although they are indistinct in some individuals. The pattern on the flanks varies from three or four large spots to many (30-44) small spots. All males have dark flecks or reticulations on the throat; in some individuals the chest and belly are heavily flecked. Although the amount of flecking is much less in most females, one individual is as heavily flecked on the throat and belly as any male.  The change in coloration in this frog is noteworthy. The following description of metachrosis in seven specimens from the Río Claro illustrates the change. At night the frogs were yellowish tan above with slightly darker dorsal markings. The axilla, groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, ventral surfaces of the hind limbs, and webbing on the hands and feet were tomato red. By day, some individuals became creamy yellow, others ashy white, and others grayish tan. The flanks were dark blue with yellow spots.  _Comparisons._--The population of frogs described here closely resembles _Hyla pseudopuma_ Günther in the highlands of Costa Rica. Both have the same kind of, and variation in, dorsal markings; conical, pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes; bilobate vocal sac; and large prepollex bearing horny nuptial spinules. Although at present no evidence for intergradation exists, the population described here is considered to be a subspecies of _Hyla pseudopuma_.  The two subspecies exhibit few differences in size and proportions, except that the tympanum is larger in _pseudopuma_ (Table 1). _Hyla p. pseudopuma_ has dark brown or yellowish tan thighs and brown flanks with a few creamy white spots; the groin in some specimens is pale blue. The red color on the limbs characteristic of _infucata_ is lacking in _pseudopuma_, which also lacks the white stripe above the anus characteristic of _infucata_. The only noticeable morphological difference between the subspecies, except in the size of the tympanum, is the shape of the snout. In _infucata_ the snout is bluntly rounded in lateral profile and truncate in dorsal profile, whereas in _pseudopuma_ the snout is more acutely rounded in lateral profile and acuminate in dorsal profile (Fig. 1). This external difference is correlated with the nature of the underlying premaxillaries. In _infucata_ the premaxillaries lie in a transverse plane and"]]]
