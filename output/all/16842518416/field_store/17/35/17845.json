Use a bicycle lamp to illumine the wire by night. The apparatus is now adjusted, and the observer has only to wait for the stars which he desires to observe, and to note by his watch the time at which they pass behind the wire. It will be seen that the wire takes the place of the vertical edge of the building, and that the board with the screw eyes is introduced solely to keep the observer in the right place relative to the wire.  12. A SIDEREAL CLOCK.--Clocks are sometimes so made and regulated that they show always the same hour and minute when the stars come back to the same place, and such a timepiece is called a sidereal clock--i. e., a star-time clock. Would such a clock gain or lose in comparison with an ordinary watch? Could an ordinary watch be turned into a sidereal watch by moving the regulator?  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photographing the circumpolar stars.--BARNARD.]  13. PHOTOGRAPHING THE STARS.--EXERCISE 7.--For any student who uses a camera. Upon some clear and moonless night point the camera, properly focused, at Polaris, and expose a plate for three or four hours. Upon developing the plate you should find a series of circular trails such as are shown in Fig. 8, only longer. Each one of these is produced by a star moving slowly over the plate, in consequence of its changing position in the sky. The center indicated by these curved trails is called the pole of the heavens. It is that part of the sky toward which is pointed the axis about which the earth rotates, and the motion of the stars around the center is only an apparent motion due to the rotation of the earth which daily carries the observer and his camera around this axis while the stars stand still, just as trees and fences and telegraph poles stand still, although to the passenger upon a railway train they appear to be in rapid motion. So far as simple observations are concerned, there is no method by which the pupil can tell for himself that the motion of the stars is an apparent rather than a real one, and, following the custom of astronomers, we shall habitually speak as if it were a real movement of the stars. How long was the plate exposed in photographing Fig. 8?  14. FINDING THE STARS.--On Plate I, opposite page 124, the pole of the heavens is at the center of the map, near Polaris, and the heavy trail near the center of Fig. 8 is made by Polaris. See if you can identify from the map any of the stars whose trails show in the photograph. The brighter the star the bolder and heavier its trail.  Find from the map and locate in the sky the two bright stars Capella and Vega, which are on opposite sides of Polaris and nearly equidistant from it. Do these stars share in the motion around the pole? Are they visible on every clear night, and all night?  Observe other bright stars farther from Polaris than are Vega and Capella and note their movement. Do they move like the sun and moon? Do they rise and set?  In what part of the sky do the stars move most rapidly, near the pole or far from it?  How long does it take the fastest moving stars to make the circuit of the sky and come back to the same place? How long does it take the slow stars?  15. RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.--A study of the sky along the lines indicated in these questions will show that there is a considerable part of it surrounding the pole whose stars are visible on every clear night. The same star is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes low, sometimes to the east of the pole and at other times west of it, but is always above the horizon. Such stars are said to be circumpolar. A little farther from the pole each star, when at the lowest point of its circular path, dips for a time below the horizon and is lost to view, and the farther it is away from the pole the longer does it remain invisible, until, in the case of stars 90° away from the pole, we find them hidden below the horizon for twelve hours out of every twenty-four (see Fig. 9). The sun is such a star, and in its rising and setting acts precisely as does every other star at a similar distance from the pole--only, as we shall find later, each star keeps always at (nearly) the same distance from the pole, while the sun in the course of a year changes its distance from the pole very greatly, and thus changes the amount of time it spends above and below the horizon, producing in this way the long days of summer and the short ones of winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diurnal motion of the northern constellations.]  How much time do stars which are more than 90° from the pole spend above the horizon?  We say in common speech that the sun rises in the east, but this is strictly true only at the time when it is 90° distant from the pole--i. e., in March and September. At other seasons it rises north or south of east according as its distance from the pole is less or greater than 90°, and the same is true for the stars.  16. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SKY.--Find from a map the latitude and longitude of your schoolhouse. Find on the map the place whose latitude is 39° and longitude 77° west of the meridian of Greenwich. Is there any other place in the world which has the same latitude and longitude as your schoolhouse?  The places of the stars in the sky are located in exactly the manner which is illustrated by these geographical questions, only different names are used. Instead of latitude the astronomer says _declination_, in place of longitude he says _right ascension_, in place of meridian he says _hour circle_, but he means by these new names the same ideas that the geographer expresses by the old ones.  Imagine the earth swollen up until it fills the whole sky; the earth's equator would meet the sky along a line (a great circle) everywhere 90° distant from the pole, and this line is called the _celestial equator_. Trace its position along the middle of the map opposite page 190 and notice near what stars it runs. Every meridian of the swollen earth would touch the sky along an hour circle--i. e., a great circle passing through the pole and therefore perpendicular to the equator. Note that in the map one of these hour circles is marked 0. It plays the same part in measuring right ascensions as does the meridian of Greenwich in measuring longitudes; it is the beginning, from which they are reckoned. Note also, at the extreme left end of the map, the four bright stars in the form of a square, one side of which is parallel and close to the hour circle, which is marked 0. This is familiarly called the Great Square in Pegasus, and may be found high up in the southern sky whenever the Big Dipper lies below the pole. Why can it not be seen when Ursa Major is above the pole?  Astronomers use the right ascensions of the stars not only to tell in what part of the sky the star is placed, but also in time reckonings, to regulate their sidereal clocks, and with regard to this use they find it convenient to express right ascension not in degrees but in hours, 24 of which fill up the circuit of the sky and each of which is equal to 15° of arc, 24 × 15 = 360. The right ascension of Capella is 5h. 9m. = 77.2°, but the student should accustom himself to using it in hours and minutes as given and not to change it into degrees. He should also note that some stars lie on the side of the celestial equator toward Polaris, and others are on the opposite side, so that the astronomer has to distinguish between north declinations and south declinations, just as the geographer distinguishes between north latitudes and south latitudes. This is done by the use of the + and - signs, a + denoting that the star lies north of the celestial equator, i. e., toward Polaris.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--From a photograph of the Pleiades.]  Find on Plate II, opposite page 190, the Pleiades (Plēadēs), R. A. = 3h. 42m., Dec. = +23.8°. Why do they not show on Plate I, opposite page 124? In what direction are they from Polaris? This is one of the finest star clusters in the sky, but it needs a telescope to bring out its richness. See how many stars you can count in it with the naked eye, and afterward examine it with an opera glass. Compare what you see with Fig. 10. Find Antares, R. A. = 16h. 23m. Dec. = -26.2°. How far is it, in degrees, from the pole? Is it visible in your sky? If so, what is its color?  Find the R. A. and Dec. of α Ursæ Majoris; of β Ursæ Majoris; of Polaris. Find the Northern Crown, _Corona Borealis_, R. A. = 15h. 30m., Dec. = +27.0°; the Beehive, _Præsepe_, R. A. = 8h. 33m., Dec. = +20.4°.  These should be looked up, not only on the map, but also in the sky.  17. REFERENCE LINES AND CIRCLES.--As the stars move across the sky in their diurnal motion, they carry the framework of hour circles and equator with them, so that the right ascension and declination of each star remain unchanged by this motion, just as longitudes and latitudes remain unchanged by the earth's rotation. They are the same when a star is rising and when it is setting; when it is above the pole and when it is below it. During each day the hour circle of every star in the heavens passes overhead, and at the moment when any particular hour circle is exactly overhead all the stars which lie upon it are said to be \"on the meridian\"--i. e., at that particular moment they stand directly over the observer's geographical meridian and upon the corresponding celestial meridian.  An eye placed at the center of the earth and capable of looking through its solid substance would see your geographical meridian against the background of the sky exactly covering your celestial meridian and passing from one pole through your zenith to the other pole. In Fig. 11 the inner circle represents the terrestrial meridian of a certain place, _O_, as seen from the center of the earth, _C_, and the outer circle represents the celestial meridian of _O_ as seen from _C_, only we must imagine, what can"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],["title","A Text-Book of Astronomy (#4)"],["body","be shown on the figure, that the outer circle is so large that the inner one shrinks to a mere point in comparison with it. If _C P_ represents the direction in which the earth's axis passes through the center, then _C E_ at right angles to it must be the direction of the equator which we suppose to be turned edgewise toward us; and if _C O_ is the direction of some particular point on the earth's surface, then _Z_ directly overhead is called the _zenith_ of that point, upon the celestial sphere. The line _C H_ represents a direction parallel to the horizon plane at _O_, and _H C P_ is the angle which the axis of the earth makes with this horizon plane. The arc _O E_ measures the latitude of _O_, and the arc _Z E_ measures the declination of _Z_, and since by elementary geometry each of these arcs contains the same number of degrees as the angle _E C Z_, we have the  _Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the declination of its zenith.  _Corollary._--Any star whose declination is equal to your latitude will once in each day pass through your zenith.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Reference lines and circles.]  18. LATITUDE.--From the construction of the figure      ∠ _E C Z_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°     ∠ _H C P_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°  from which we find by subtraction and transposition      ∠ _E C Z_ = ∠ _H C P_  and this gives the further  _Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the elevation of the pole above its horizon plane.  An observer who travels north or south over the earth changes his latitude, and therefore changes the angle between his horizon plane and the axis of the earth. What effect will this have upon the position of stars in his sky? If you were to go to the earth's equator, in what part of the sky would you look for Polaris? Can Polaris be seen from Australia? From South America? If you were to go from Minnesota to Texas, in what respect would the appearance of stars in the northern sky be changed? How would the appearance of stars in the southern sky be changed?  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diurnal path of Polaris.]  EXERCISE 8.--Determine your latitude by taking the altitude of Polaris when it is at some one of the four points of its diurnal path, shown in Fig. 12. When it is at _1_ it is said to be at upper culmination, and the star ζ Ursæ Majoris in the handle of the Big Dipper will be directly below it. When at _2_ it is at western elongation, and the star Castor is near the meridian. When it is at _3_ it is at lower culmination, and the star Spica is on the meridian. When it is at _4_ it is at eastern elongation, and Altair is near the meridian. All of these stars are conspicuous ones, which the student should find upon the map and learn to recognize in the sky. The altitude observed at either _2_ or _4_ may be considered equal to the latitude of the place, but the altitude observed when Polaris is at the positions marked _1_ and _3_ must be corrected for the star's distance from the pole, which may be assumed equal to 1.3°.  The plumb-line apparatus described at page 12 is shown in Fig. 6 slightly modified, so as to adapt it to measuring the altitudes of stars. Note that the board with the screw eye at one end has been transferred from the box to the vertical standard, and has a screw eye at each end. When the apparatus has been properly leveled, so that the plumb line hangs at the middle of the hole in the box cover, the board is to be pointed at the star by sighting through the centers of the two screw eyes, and a pencil line is to be ruled along its edge upon the face of the vertical standard. After this has been done turn the apparatus halfway around so that what was the north side now points south, level it again and revolve the board about the screw which holds it to the vertical standard, until the screw eyes again point to the star. Rule another line along the same edge of the board as before and with a protractor measure the angle between these lines. Use a bicycle lamp if you need artificial light for your work. The student who has studied plane geometry should be able to prove that one half of the angle between these lines is equal to the altitude of the star.  After you have determined your latitude from Polaris, compare the result with your position as shown upon the best map available. With a little practice and considerable care the latitude may be thus determined within one tenth of a degree, which is equivalent to about 7 miles. If you go 10 miles north or south from your first station you should find the pole higher up or lower down in the sky by an amount which can be measured with your apparatus.  19. THE MERIDIAN LINE.--To establish a true north and south line upon the ground, use the apparatus as described at page 13, and when Polaris is at upper or lower culmination drive into the ground two stakes in line with the star and the plumb line. Such a meridian line is of great convenience in observing the stars and should be laid out and permanently marked in some convenient open space from which, if possible, all parts of the sky are visible. June and November are convenient months for this exercise, since Polaris then comes to culmination early in the evening.  20. TIME.--What is _the time_ at which school begins in the morning? What do you mean by \"_the time_\"?  The sidereal time at any moment is the right ascension of the hour circle which at that moment coincides with the meridian. When the hour circle passing through Sirius coincides with the meridian, the sidereal time is 6h. 40m., since that is the right ascension of Sirius, and in astronomical language Sirius is \"_on the meridian_\" at 6h. 40m. sidereal time. As may be seen from the map, this 6h. 40m. is the right ascension of Sirius, and if a clock be set to indicate 6h. 40m. when Sirius crosses the meridian, it will show sidereal time. If the clock is properly regulated, every other star in the heavens will come to the meridian at the moment when the time shown by the clock is equal to the right ascension of the star. A clock properly regulated for this purpose will gain about four minutes per day in comparison with ordinary clocks, and when so regulated it is called a sidereal clock. The student should be provided with such a clock for his future work, but one such clock will serve for several persons, and a nutmeg clock or a watch of the cheapest kind is quite sufficient.  [Illustration: THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.]  EXERCISE 9.--Set such a clock to sidereal time by means of the transit of a star over your meridian. For this experiment it is presupposed that a meridian line has been marked out on the ground as in § 19, and the simplest mode of performing the experiment required is for the observer, having chosen a suitable star in the southern part of the sky, to place his eye accurately over the northern end of the meridian line and to estimate as nearly as possible the beginning and end of the period during which the star appears to stand exactly above the southern end of the line. The middle of this period may be taken as the time at which the star crossed the meridian and at this moment the sidereal time is equal to the right ascension of the star. The difference between this right ascension and the observed middle instant is the error of the clock or the amount by which its hands must be set back or forward in order to indicate true sidereal time.  A more accurate mode of performing the experiment consists in using the plumb-line apparatus carefully adjusted, as in Fig. 7, so that the line joining the wire to the center of the screw eye shall be parallel to the meridian line. Observe the time by the clock at which the star disappears behind the wire as seen through the center of the screw eye. If the star is too high up in the sky for convenient observation, place a mirror, face up, just north of the screw eye and observe star, wire and screw eye by reflection in it.  The numerical right ascension of the observed star is needed for this experiment, and it may be measured from the star map, but it will usually be best to observe one of the stars of the table at the end of the book, and to obtain its right ascension as follows: The table gives the right ascension and declination of each star as they were at the beginning of the year 1900, but on account of the precession (see Chapter V), these numbers all change slowly with the lapse of time, and on the average the right ascension of each star of the table must be increased by one twentieth of a minute for each year after 1900--i. e., in 1910 the right ascension of the first star of the table will be 0h. 38.6m. + (10/20)m. = 0h. 39.1m. The declinations also change slightly, but as they are only intended to help in finding the star on the star maps, their change may be ignored.  Having set the clock approximately to sidereal time, observe one or two more stars in the same way as above. The difference between the observed time and the right ascension, if any is found, is the \"correction\" of the clock. This correction ought not to exceed a minute if due care has been taken in the several operations prescribed. The relation of the clock to the right ascension of the stars is expressed in the following equation, with which the student should become thoroughly familiar:      A = T ± U  _T_ stands for the time by the clock at which the star crossed the meridian. _A_ is the right ascension of the star, and _U_ is the correction of the clock. Use the + sign in the equation whenever the clock is too slow, and the - sign when it is too fast. _U_ may be found from this equation when _A_ and _T_ are given, or _A_ may be found when _T_ and _U_ are given. It is in this way that astronomers measure the right ascensions of the stars and planets.  Determine _U_ from each star you have observed, and note how the several results agree one with another.  21. DEFINITIONS.--To define a thing or an idea is to give a description sufficient to"]]]
