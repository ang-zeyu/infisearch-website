Ireland is very proud of these sons of the Irish race who, in every part of the Empire, have followed the lead which she herself has given in rallying to the cause with which she has always sympathised and has always supported--the cause of right against might. The Irish race is represented in this war by at least half a million of men who have voluntarily joined the Colours. How gallantly they have fought this book, in part, relates. In his first series of _The Irish at the Front_ Mr. MacDonagh deals with the achievements of the Irish Guards and the Regular Irish regiments of the Line in Flanders and France in the earlier years of the war; the landing of the Munsters and Dublins of the immortal 29th Division at Beach V, Gallipoli; and the fighting of the 10th (Irish) Division of the New Armies at Suvla Bay. The story of these glorious deeds sent a wave of emotion through the land. The King, addressing a battalion of the Irish Guards on St. Patrick's Day, 1916, said--      \"On St. Patrick's Day, when Irishmen the world over unite to     celebrate the memory of their Patron Saint, it gives me great     pleasure to inspect the reserve battalion of my Irish Guards,     and to testify my appreciation of the services rendered by the     regiment in this war.... I gratefully remember the heroic     endurance of the 1st Battalion in the arduous retreat from Mons,     again at Ypres on the critical November 1st, when, as Lord     Cavan, your Brigadier, wrote, those who were left showed the     enemy that Irish Guards must be reckoned with, however hard hit.     After twenty-eight days of incessant fighting against heavy     odds, the battalion came out of the line less than a company     strong, with only four officers--a glorious tribute to Irish     loyalty and endurance.... In conferring the Victoria Cross on     Lance-Corporal, now Lieutenant, Michael O'Leary, the first Irish     Guardsman to win this coveted distinction, I was proud to honour     a deed that, in its fearless contempt of death, illustrates the     spirit of my Irish Guards. At Loos the 2nd Battalion received     its baptism of fire and confirmed the high reputation already     won by the 1st Battalion.\"  _The Daily Telegraph_ (London), writing on March 18, 1916, said--      \"There is one key to the soul of Ireland--the word 'freedom.' It     was realised instantly that this was no dynastic war on the part     of the Allies, no struggle for material ends, but a life and     death conflict for liberty of thought and action. Once the issue     was exposed, Irishmen, with all the white heat which injustice     inspires in their breasts, threw themselves into the battle. The     enemy has since felt Irish steel and fallen under Irish bullets.     Whatever the future may have in store, the British people will     never forget the generous blood of the sister nation, which has     been shed on so many hard-fought battlefields since the     world-war began.\"  In this, the second series of _The Irish at the Front_, the thrilling story is continued. The Irish troops dealt with are all of the New Armies--the Ulster Division, the Irish Division and the Tyneside Irish Brigade. I am as proud of the Ulster regiments as I am of the Nationalist regiments. I do not want to boast of their valour. We Irishmen are inclined to take it as a matter of course. These Irish regiments, Unionist and Nationalist, merely keep up the tradition of our race. But I say that Lord Kitchener's words remain true--the words that he wrote to the Viceregal Recruiting Conference in Dublin in 1915, when he said that in the matter of recruiting, \"Ireland's performance has been magnificent.\" Let me ask any fair-minded man this question: If five years ago any one had predicted that in a great war in which the Empire was engaged 173,772 men would have been raised from Ireland, and that there would be more than half a million Irishmen with the Colours, would he not have been looked upon as a lunatic? It is the free offering of Ireland. Surely it must be regarded as a proud and astonishing record!                                                      J.E. REDMOND.     PREFACE   This narrative is concerned chiefly with the three distinctively Irish units of the New Armies engaged on the Western Front--the Ulster Division, the Irish Division (representative of the south and west), and the \"Tyneside Irish,\" in which Irishmen living in the north of England enlisted. It also deals incidentally with the Irish Regular regiments of the Line, and with that numerous body of Irishmen serving in English, Scottish and Welsh battalions and in the Anzacs and Canadians.  The first series of _The Irish at the Front_ covers, first, the fighting of the Irish regiments of the Regular Army in France, Flanders and the Dardanelles during the early stages of the war; and, secondly, the operations of the 10th (Irish) Division--composed entirely of \"Kitchener's men\"--against the Turks at Gallipoli. The latter, an exceptionally fine body of young Irishmen, gallantly fought and fell--as the story discloses--in that expedition, so ill-fated and yet so romantic, though they had never handled a rifle or done a day's drill before the war. In this series we see Irishmen of the same type matched against the Germans in France. As we know, Germany confidently expected that such levies, hastily raised and insufficiently trained, would break in pieces at the first encounter with her seasoned troops. But it was the formidable German lines that were broken, and they were broken by these very raw levies at the bayonet's point.  For the telling of the Irish part in the story of the Somme I am much indebted to the assistance given by officers and men of the Irish battalions engaged in that mighty battle. But the Irish soldiers are not only \"splendid fighting material\"--a rather non-human phrase now much in vogue, as if the only thing that matters in warfare is the physical capacity of man--they have souls and minds and hearts, as well as strong right hands, and of these also something is said in this book.

Those referred to belonged to a battalion of the Connaught Rangers ordered to the firing-trenches for the first time. \"The real thing at last;\" \"The genuine McCoy, and no mistake,\" they said to one another as, in preparation for the march, they hurriedly packed their things in the barns and cow-sheds that served as billets, and, to provide further vent for their jubilation, danced Irish jigs and reels and sang national songs.  These Irishmen had read a lot about the fighting, and had heard a great deal more, but they felt that print and talk, however graphic and copious, left many strange things to be disclosed by the actual experience. Some of them would \"get the beck\"--the call from Death--but what matter? Were not soldiers who died in action to be envied, rather than pitied, by those who found themselves alive when the war was over, and had not been to the mysterious Front at all? So they thought and said, and now that they were on the road there was a look of proud elation on their faces, as though they had been singled out by special favour for a grand adventure. They did not regard themselves in the least as heroes, these entirely unsophisticated men, without a trace of self-consciousness. They had volunteered for service in the belief that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34907"],["title","The Irish on the Somme (#2)"],["body","would be false to her historical self if she did not take part in this war for freedom, democracy and humanity. But now there was nothing in their minds about revenging the wrongs of Belgium, or driving the invader from the soil of France, or even of saving the British Empire. It was the fight that was the thing. It was the chance of having a smack at \"the Gerrys\"--as the enemy is called by the Irish soldiers--that they prized. More exalted feelings would come again when the battle was over and won. Then, and not till then, as they return with many gaps in their ranks, do Irish troops see themselves as an army of redemption and deliverance; and the only land they think of having saved is Ireland. To them Ireland personifies all the great causes of the war, and a blow struck for these causes, no matter where, is a blow struck for her.  By the light of many stars sparkling in the sky that dark October night the men could see signs that battles had been fought in the country they were traversing. It was a devastated bare expanse, stretching for miles and miles, very muddy and broken up with shell holes. Roads had been made across it, and along one of these the battalion went in the wake of the guides with swinging lanterns. The men were fully loaded. In addition to his fighting equipment, almost every one carried something extra, such as a pick or shovel, a bag of rations, or a bundle of fire-wood. The company officers also had heavy packs strapped on their shoulders. Great good-humour prevailed. Whenever, at awkward turns of the road, or at very dark points, progress was interrupted, those in front would shout some preposterous explanation of the delay to their comrades behind. \"Begonnies, boys, we're taking tickets here for Galway. Word has come down that the war is over,\" cried one joker. Deep groans of pretended dismay and disappointment rose from the rear ranks. \"And poor me, without a German helmet, or even a black eye, to show that I was in it,\" was one of the responses.  When the open plain was quitted the battalion disappeared into a trench like a narrow country lane winding between high banks. It was much darker in these deeps than it had been outside. The gloom was broken occasionally by the light of lanterns carried by sentinels, or electric torches at junctions where several trenches crossed. Soon the trench became narrower and more tortuous. It also became more soaked with rain. Pools of water were frequently encountered. The battalion was now a floundering, staggering, overloaded and perspiring closely packed mass of men, walking in couples or in single file and treading on each other's heels.  The mishaps arising from this crowded scramble in the dark through mud and mire, between banks of unsupported crumbling earth, did not exhaust the Irish cheerfulness of the battalion. There was laughter when a man got a crack on the skull from a rifle which a comrade carried swung across his shoulder. There was louder laughter still when another, stooping to pick up something he had dropped, was bumped into from behind and sent sprawling. So sucking and tenacious was the mud that frequently each dragging footstep called for quite a physical effort, and a man was thankful that he did not have to leave a boot behind. \"Ah, sure this is nothin' to the bog away in Connemara, where I often sunk up to me neck when crossing it to cut turf,\" was the comfort imparted in a soft brogue. \"True for you, Tim,\" remarked another. \"It's an ould sayin' and a true one that there's nothin' so bad but it could be worse.\"  The trench certainly proved the truth of the saying. Bad as it had been, it sank to a still lower degree of slush. There were deep holes filled with water into which the men went with an abrupt plunge and passed through with much splashing. Just ahead of one of these particularly treacherous points singing was heard. The chorus was taken up by many voices, and its last line was rapped out with hearty boisterousness--      \"Out and make way for the bould Fenian Men.\"  This joyous noise heralded the appearance of a party of the Dublin Fusiliers, belonging to the same Division, who were coming down the trench. By the light of lanterns and lamps it was seen that they had taken off their trousers and socks and, holding up their shirts, were wading in their boots blithely through the pools, like girls in bare legs and lifted petticoats paddling at the seaside.  The Connaught men laughed hilariously. \"Sure the Dublin jackeens have never been beaten yet for cuteness,\" they cried. \"They stripped to their pelts so as they wouldn't get the 'fluensy by means of their wet clothes. And, faix, 'twould be the greatest pity in the world anything would ail stout and hearty boys like them.\" As they spoke, the men of the west lay close against the embankments to let the men of the east go by. But weren't the Dublins in the divil of a hurry back to billets? the Rangers went on to remark. And why not? answered the Dublins. Sure if they'd only sniff with their noses they would smell the roast beef and the steaming punch that were being got ready for them by special orders of Field-Marshal Haig for the great things they did away up in the firing-line. \"Lucky boys!\" shouted the Rangers, responding to the joke. \"And tell us now, have ye left us a Gerry at all alive to get a pelt at, and we new at the game?\" A Dublin man gave the reply as he went past. \"To tell ye the truth, except there's a raid, there isn't much divarshion in the way of fighting; but every man of ye will have his full and plenty of mud and water before he's much oulder.\" \"Well, there's nothing in that to yowl about.\" \"Maybe not, if you can swim.\" The trench resounded with laughter at the exchange of banter. But for fear any of the Rangers might take some of the talk as half a joke and whole earnest, a kind-hearted sergeant of the Dublins, wishful to say the cheery word, called out, \"Don't mind them playboys; there's no more water and mud in it than is natural in such wet weather as we're getting.\"  The Rangers reached their destination just as the day was dawning in a cold drizzle from a grey, lowering sky. They were all plastered with yellowish mud. Mud was on their hands, on their faces, in their hair, down their backs; and the barrels of their rifles were choked with mud. For the next four days and nights of duty in the trenches they were to be lapped about with mud. War was to be for them a mixture of mud and high explosives. Of the two mud was the ugliest and most hateful. Soon they would come to think that there was hardly anything left in the world but mud; and from that they would advance to a state of mind in which they doubted whether there ever had been a time in their existence when they were free from mud. But through it all this battalion, like the others in the Division, preserved their good-humour. They are known, in fact, as \"The Light-Hearted Brigade.\" Every difficulty was met with a will to overcome it, tempered with a joke and a laugh. No matter how encrusted with filth their bodies might be, their souls were always above contamination.  Men off duty at night slept in shelter pits dug deep into the soil by the side of the trenches. It was overcrowded in stark violation of all the sanitary by-laws relating to ventilation in civil life. No time was wasted in undressing. The men lay down fully clad in their mud-crusted clothes, even to their boots, wrapped round in blankets. During the night they were awakened by a loud explosion. \"All right, boys; don't stir,\" cried the sergeant. \"It's only one of those chape German alarum clocks going off at the wrong time. Get off to sleep again, me heroes.\" In the morning more time was saved by getting up fully dressed, and not having to wash or to shave, so as to spare the water. A private, looking round the dug-out and noticing the absence of windows, remarked, \"Faix, those of us who are glaziers and window-cleaners will find it hard to make a living in this country.\"  As the battalion was new to the trenches, another Irish battalion of more experience shared with them the holding of this particular line. To a group of lads gathered about a brazier of glowing coke in a sheltered traverse an old sergeant that had seen service in the Regular Army was giving what, no doubt, he thought was sound and valuable advice, but which was at times of a quality calculated more to disturb, perhaps, than to reassure.  \"Bullets are nothin' at all,\" said he. \"I wouldn't give you a snap of me fingers for them. Listen to them now, flyin' about and whinin' and whimperin' as if they wor lost, stolen or strayed, and wor lookin' for a billet to rest in. They differ greatly, do these bullets; but sure in time you'll larn them all by sound and be able to tell the humour each one of them is in. There's only one kind of bullet, boys, that you'll never hear; and that is the one which gives you such a pelt as to send you home to Ireland or to kingdom come. But,\" he continued, \"what'll put the fear of God into your sowls, if it isn't there already, is the heavy metal which the Gerrys pitch across to us in exchange for ours. The first time I was up here I was beside a man whose teeth went chatterin' in a way that put me in fear of me life. Sure, didn't I think for a minute it was a Gerry machine-gun--may the divil cripple them!--startin' its bloody work at me ear. Now, there must be none of that in this trench. If you're afraid, don't show it; remimber always that the Gerrys are in just as great a fright, if not more so. Show your spunk. Stand fast or sit tight, and hope for the best. Above all, clinch your teeth.\"  The bombardment of a trench by shells from guns in the rear of the enemy's lines, or by bombs thrown from mortars close at hand, is probably the greatest test of endurance that has ever been set to humanity. The devastating effect is terrific. At each explosion men may be blown to pieces or buried alive. Even the concussion"]]]
