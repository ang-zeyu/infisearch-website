The type illustrated to the right in Fig. 19 has two adjustable jaws which are located nearly opposite the turning tool, thus providing support where it is most needed. In using this rest, a cut is started at the end and the jaws are adjusted to this turned part. The tool is then fed across the shaft, which cannot spring away from the cut because of the supporting jaws. Some follow-rests have, instead of jaws, a bushing bored to fit the diameter being turned, different bushings being used for different diameters. The bushing forms a bearing for the work and holds it rigidly. Whether a bushing or jaws are used, the turning tool is slightly in advance of the supporting member.  [Illustration: Fig. 24. Testing Work with Dial Indicator]  =Centering Parts to be Turned.=--As previously mentioned, there are a number of different methods of forming center-holes in the ends of parts that have to be turned while held between lathe centers. A method of centering light work, and one that requires few special tools, is first to locate a central point on the end and then drill and ream the center-hole by using the lathe itself. Hermaphrodite dividers are useful for finding the center, as illustrated at _A_, Fig. 25, but if the work is fairly round, a center-square _B_ is preferable. A line is scribed across the end and then another line at right angles to the first by changing the position of the square; the intersection of these two lines will be the center, which should be marked by striking a pointed punch _C_ with a hammer. If a cup or bell center-punch _D_ is available, it will not be necessary to first make center lines, as the conical part shown locates the punch in a central position. This style of punch should only be used on work which is fairly round.  [Illustration: Fig. 25. Centering End with Punch preparatory to Drilling]  After small centers have been located in both ends, their position can be tested by placing the work between the lathe centers and rotating it rapidly by drawing the hand quickly across it. By holding a piece of chalk close to the work as it spins around, a mark will be made on the \"high\" side if the centers are not accurate; the centers are then shifted toward these marks. If the work is close to the finished diameter, the centers should, of course, be located quite accurately in order that the entire surface of the work will be turned true when it is reduced to the finished size.  One method of forming these center-holes is indicated in Fig. 26. A chuck _C_ is screwed onto the spindle in place of the faceplate, and a combination center drill and reamer _R_ is gripped by the chuck jaws and set to run true. The center is then drilled and reamed at one end by pressing the work against the revolving drill with the tailstock spindle, which is fed out by turning handle _n_. The piece is then reversed for drilling the opposite end. The work may be kept from revolving while the centers are being drilled and reamed, by attaching a dog to it close to the tailstock end and then adjusting the cross-slide until the dog rests upon the slide. Many parts can be held by simply gripping them with one hand. From the foregoing it will be seen that the small centers made by punch _C_, Fig. 25, serve as a starting point for the drill and also as a support for the outer end of the work while the first hole is being drilled.  [Illustration: Fig. 26. Drilling Centers in the Lathe]  The form of center-hole produced by a combination drill and reamer is shown by the lower left-hand view in Fig. 27. A small straight hole a in the bottom prevents the point of the lathe center from coming in contact with the work and insures a good bearing on the conical surface _c_. The standard angle for lathe centers is sixty degrees, as the illustration shows, and the tapering part of all center-holes should be made to this angle.  [Illustration: Fig. 27. Centers of Incorrect and Correct Form]  [Illustration: Fig. 28. Special Machine for Centering Parts to be Turned]  =Centering Machine.=--Many shops have a special machine for forming centers which enables the operation to be performed quickly. One type of centering machine is shown in Fig. 28. The work is gripped in a chuck _C_ that automatically locates it in a central position so that it is not necessary to lay out the end before drilling. There are two spindles _s_, one of which holds the drill and the other the countersink, and these are rotated by a belt passing over pulley _P_. Each of these spindles is advanced by lever _L_ and either of them can be moved to a position central with the work, as they are mounted in a swiveling frame. In operating this machine, a small straight hole is first made by a twist drill held in one of the spindles; the other spindle is then moved over to the center and the hole is reamed tapering. The arrangement is such that neither spindle can be advanced by the feeding lever except when in a central position. The amount that each spindle can be advanced is limited by a fixed collar inside the head, and there is also a swinging adjustable stop against which the end of the work should be placed before tightening the chuck. These two features make it possible to ream center holes of the same size or depth in any number of pieces.  [Illustration: Fig. 29. The Imperfect Center Bearing is the Result of Centering before Straightening]  =Different Forms of Centers.=--In some poorly equipped shops it is necessary to form centers by the use of a center-punch only, as there is no better tool. If the end of the punch has a sixty-degree taper, a fair center can be formed in this way, but it is not a method to be recommended, especially when accurate work is required. Sometimes centers are made with punches that are too blunt, producing a shallow center, such as the one shown in the upper left-hand view, Fig. 27. In this case all the bearing is on the point of the lathe center, which is the worst possible place for it. Another way is to simply drill a straight hole as in the upper view to the right; this is also bad practice in more than one respect. The lower view to the right shows a form of center which is often found in the ends of lathe arbors, the mouth of the center being rounded, at _r_, and the arbor end recessed as shown. The rounded corner prevents the point of the lathe center from catching when it is moved rapidly towards work which is not being held quite centrally (as shown by the illustration), and the end is recessed to protect the center against bruises. Stock that is bent should always be straightened before the centers are drilled and reamed. If the work is first centered and then straightened the bearing on the lathe center would be as shown in Fig. 29. The center will then wear unevenly with the result that the surfaces last turned will not be concentric with those which were finished first.  [Illustration: Fig. 30. Tool Steel should be centered Concentric, in order to remove the Decarbonized Outer Surface]  =Precaution When Centering Tool Steel.=--Ordinarily centers are so located that the stock runs approximately true before being turned, but when centering tool steel to be used in making tools, such as reamers, mills, etc., which need to be hardened, particular care should be taken to have the rough surface run fairly true. This is not merely to insure that the piece will \"true-up,\" as there is a more important consideration, the disregard of which often affects the quality of the finished tool. As is well known, the degree of hardness of a piece of tool steel that has been heated and then suddenly cooled depends upon the amount of carbon that it contains, steel that is high in carbon becoming much harder than that which contains less carbon. Furthermore, the amount of carbon found at the surface, and to some little depth below the surface of a bar of steel, is less than the carbon content in the rest of the bar. This is illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 30 by the shaded area in the view to the left. (This decarbonization is probably due to the action of the oxygen of the air on the bar during the process of manufacture.) If stock for a reamer is so centered that the tool removes the decarbonized surface only on one side, as illustrated to the right, evidently when the reamer is finished and hardened the teeth on the side _A_ will be harder than those on the opposite side, which would not have been the case if the rough bar had been centered true. To avoid any trouble of this kind, stock that is to be used for hardened tools should be enough larger than the finished diameter and so centered that this decarbonized surface will be entirely removed in turning.  [Illustration: Fig. 31. Three Methods of Facing the Ends Square]  =Facing the Ends of Centered Stock.=--As a piece of work is not properly centered until the ends are faced square, we will consider this operation in connection with centering. Some machinists prefer lathe centers that are cut away as shown at _A_, Fig. 31, so that the point of the side tool can be fed in far enough to face the end right up to the center hole. Others, instead of using a special center, simply loosen the regular one slightly and then, with the tool in a position as at _B_, face the projecting teat by feeding both tool and center inward as shown by the arrow. Whenever this method is employed, care should be taken to remove any chips from the center hole which may have entered. A method which makes it unnecessary to loosen the regular center, or to use a special one, is to provide clearance for the tool-point by grinding it to an angle of approximately forty-five degrees, as shown at _C_. If the tool is not set too high, it can then be fed right up to the lathe center and the end squared without difficulty. As for the special center _A_, the use of special tools and appliances should always be avoided unless they effect a saving in time or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34030"],["title","Turning and Boring (#6)"],["body","use makes it possible to accomplish the same end with less work.  =Truing Lathe Centers.=--The lathe centers should receive careful attention especially when accurate work must be turned. If the headstock center does not run true as it revolves with the work, a round surface may be turned, but if the position of the driving dog with reference to the faceplate is changed, the turned surface will not run true because the turned surface is not true with the work centers. Furthermore, if it is necessary to reverse the work for finishing the dogged or driving end, the last part turned will be eccentric to the first. Therefore, the lathe centers should be kept true in order to produce turned surfaces that are true or concentric with the centered ends, as it is often necessary to change the part being turned \"end for end\" for finishing, and any eccentricity between the different surfaces would, in many cases, spoil the work.  [Illustration: Fig. 32. Grinder for Truing Lathe Centers]  Some lathes are equipped with hardened centers in both the head-and tailstock and others have only one hardened center which is in the tailstock. The object in having a soft or unhardened headstock center is to permit its being trued by turning, but as a soft center is quite easily bruised and requires truing oftener than one that is hard, it is better to have both centers hardened. Special grinders are used for truing these hardened centers. One type that is very simple and easily applied to a lathe is shown in Fig. 32. This grinder is held in the lathe toolpost and is driven by a wheel _A_ that is held in contact with the cone-pulley. The emery wheel _B_ is moved to a position for grinding by adjusting the carriage and cross-slide, and it is traversed across the conical surface of the center by handle _C_. As the grinding proceeds, the wheel is fed inward slightly by manipulating the cross-slide.  This grinder is set to the proper angle by placing the two centered ends _D_ and _D_{1}_ between the lathe centers, which should be aligned as for straight turning. The grinding spindle will then be 30 degrees from the axis of the lathe spindle. The grinder should be carefully clamped in the toolpost so that it will remain as located by the centered ends. After the tailstock center is withdrawn, the emery wheel is adjusted for grinding. As the wheel spindle is 30 degrees from the axis of the lathe spindle, the lathe center is not only ground true but to an included angle of 60 degrees, which is the standard angle for lathe centers. There are many other styles of center grinders on the market, some of which are driven by a small belt from the cone-pulley and others by electric motors which are connected with ordinary lighting circuits. The tailstock center is ground by inserting it in the spindle in place of the headstock center. Before a center is replaced in its spindle, the hole should be perfectly clean as even a small particle of dirt may affect the alignment. The center in the headstock is usually referred to as the \"live center\" because it turns around when the lathe is in use, and the center in the tailstock as the \"dead center,\" because it remains stationary.  =Universal, Independent and Combination Chucks.=--Many parts that are turned in the lathe are so shaped that they cannot be held between the lathe centers like shafts and other similar pieces and it is often necessary to hold them in a chuck _A_, Fig. 33, which is screwed onto the lathe spindle instead of the faceplate. The work is gripped by the jaws _J_ which can be moved in or out to accommodate various diameters. There are three classes of chucks ordinarily used on the lathe, known as the independent, universal and combination types. The independent chuck is so named because each jaw can be adjusted in or out independently of the others by turning the jaw screws S with a wrench. The jaws of the universal chuck all move together and keep the same distance from the center, and they can be adjusted by turning any one of the screws _S_, whereas with the independent type the chuck wrench must be applied to each jaw screw. The combination chuck, as the name implies, may be changed to operate either as an independent or universal type. The advantage of the universal chuck is that round and other parts of a uniform shape are located in a central position for turning without any adjustment. The independent type is, however, preferable in some respects as it is usually stronger and adapted for holding odd-shaped pieces because each jaw can be set to any required position.  [Illustration: Fig. 33. (A) Lathe Chuck. (B) Faceplate Jaw]  =Application of Chucks.=--As an example of chuck work, we shall assume that the sides of disk _D_, Fig. 34, are to be turned flat and parallel with each other and that an independent chuck is to be used. First the chuck is screwed onto the lathe spindle after removing the faceplate. The chuck jaws are then moved out or in, as the case may be, far enough to receive the disk and each jaw is set about the same distance from the center by the aid of concentric circles on the face of the chuck. The jaws are then tightened while the disk is held back against them to bring the rough inner surface in a vertical plane. If the work is quite heavy, it can be held against the chuck, before the jaws are tightened, by inserting a piece of wood between it and the tailstock center; the latter is then run out far enough to force the work back. The outside or periphery of the disk should run nearly true and it may be necessary to move the jaws in on one side and out on the other to bring the disk to a central position. To test its location, the lathe is run at a moderate speed and a piece of chalk is held near the outer surface. If the latter runs out, the \"high\" side will be marked by the chalk, and this mark can be used as a guide in adjusting the jaws. It should be remembered that the jaws are moved only one-half the amount that the work runs out.  [Illustration: Fig. 34. (A) Radial Facing. (B) Boring Pulley Held in Chuck]  A round-nosed tool _t_ of the shape shown can be used for radial facing or turning operations of the kind illustrated. This tool is similar to the form used when turning between centers, the principal difference being in the direction of the top slope. The radial facing tool should be ground to slope downward toward _a_ (see Fig. 35) whereas the regular turning tool slopes toward _b_, the inclination in each case being away from that part of the cutting edge which does the work. The cutting edge should be the same height as the lathe centers, and the cut is taken by feeding the tool from the outside in to the center. The cut is started by hand and then the power feed is engaged, except for small surfaces. The first cut should, if possible, be deep enough to get beneath the scale, especially if turning cast iron, as a tool which just grazes the hard outer surface will be dulled in a comparatively short time.  If it were simply necessary to turn a true flat surface and the thickness of the disk were immaterial, two cuts would be sufficient, unless the surface were very uneven, the first or roughing cut being followed by a light finishing cut. For a finishing cut, the same tool could be used, but if there were a number of disks to be faced, a square-nosed tool _F_, Fig. 35, could probably be used to better advantage. This type has a broad flat cutting edge that is set parallel with the rough-turned surface and this broad edge enables a coarse feed to be taken, thus reducing the time required for the finishing cut. If a coarse feed were taken with the round tool, the turned surface would have spiral grooves in it, whereas with the broad cutting edge, a smooth surface is obtained even though the feed is coarse. The amount of feed per revolution of the work, however, should always be less than the width _w_ of the cutting edge. Very often broad tools cannot be used for finishing cuts, especially when turning steel, because their greater contact causes chattering and results in a rough surface. An old and worn lathe is more liable to chatter than one that is heavy and well-built, and as the diameter of the work also makes a difference, a broad tool cannot always be used for finishing, even though, theoretically, it would be preferable. After one side of the disk is finished, it is reversed in the chuck, the finished surface being placed against the jaws. The remaining rough side is then turned, care being taken when starting the first cut to caliper the width of the disk at several points to make sure that the two sides are parallel.  [Illustration: Fig. 35. Tools Ground so that Top Slopes away from Working Part of Cutting Edge]  =Example of Boring.=--Another example of chuck work is shown at _B_, Fig. 34. In this case a cast-iron pulley is to have a true hole _h_ bored through the hub. (The finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces in a lathe is referred to as boring rather than turning.) The casting should be set true by the rim instead of by the rough-cored hole in the hub; this can be done by the use of chalk as previously explained. Even though a universal type of chuck were used, the jaws of which, as will be recalled, are self-centering, it might be necessary to turn the pulley relative to the chuck as a casting sometimes runs out because of rough spots or lumps which happen to come beneath one or more of the jaws.  [Illustration: Fig. 36. Boring Tool]  The shape of tool _t_ for boring is quite different from one used for outside turning, as shown by Fig. 36. The cutting end of a solid type of tool is forged approximately at right angles to the body or shank, and the top surface is ground to slope away from the working part _w_ of the cutting edge, as with practically all turning tools. The front part or flank, _f_ is also ground away to give the edge clearance. This type of tool is clamped in the toolpost with the body about parallel with the"]]]
