No charters were granted to Christian Scien-         tists for such institutions after 1883, and up to that xii:3   date, hers was the only College of this character which         had been established in the United States, where         Christian Science was first introduced.  xii:6   During seven years over four thousand students         were taught by the author in this College. Meanwhile         she was pastor of the first established Church of xii:9   Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Sci-         entist Association, convening monthly; publisher of         her own works; and (for a portion of this time) sole xii:12  editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal,         the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She         closed her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of xii:15  its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the         next two years of her life should be given to the prep-         aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which xii:18  was published in 1891. She retained her charter, and         as its President, reopened the College in 1899 as auxil-         iary to her church. Until June 10, 1907, she had never xii:21  read this book throughout consecutively in order to elu-         cidate her idealism.          In the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who \"hopeth xii:24  all things, endureth all things,\" and is joyful to bear         consolation to the sorrowing and healing to the sick,         she commits these pages to honest seekers for Truth.

CHAPTER I - PRAYER          For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this         mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and         shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those         things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have         whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things         soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,         and ye shall have them.         Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask         Him. - CHRIST JESUS.  1:1     THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the         sick is an absolute faith that all things are 1:3     possible to God,- a spiritual understanding of Him,         an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may say         or think on this subject, I speak from experience. 1:6     Prayer, watching, and working, combined with self-im-         molation, are God's gracious means for accomplishing         whatever has been successfully done for the Christian- 1:9     ization and health of mankind.          Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine         Mind. Desire is prayer; and no loss can occur from 1:12    trusting God with our desires, that they may be         moulded and exalted before they take form in words         and in deeds.                                Right motives  2:1     What are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to         make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us, 2:3     to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of         men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes,         the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous- 2:6     ness is blessed of our Father, and it does not return         unto us void.                             Deity unchangeable          God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more 2:9     than He has already done, nor can the infinite do less         than bestow all good, since He is unchang-         ing wisdom and Love. We can do more for 2:12    ourselves by humble fervent petitions, but the All-lov-         ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip-         service, for He already knows all.  2:15    Prayer cannot change the Science of being, but it         tends to bring us into harmony with it. Goodness at-         tains the demonstration of Truth. A request that 2:18    God will save us is not all that is required. The mere         habit of pleading with the divine Mind, as one pleads         with a human being, perpetuates the belief in God as 2:21    humanly circumscribed,- an error which impedes spirit-         ual growth.                               God's standard          God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is 2:24    intelligence. Can we inform the infinite Mind of any-         thing He does not already comprehend?         Do we expect to change perfection? Shall 2:27    we plead for more at the open fount, which is pour-         ing forth more than we accept? The unspoken desire         does bring us nearer the source of all existence and 2:30    blessedness.          Asking God to /be/ God is a vain repetition. God is         \"the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;\" and 3:1     He who is immutably right will do right without being         reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is not 3:3     sufficient to warrant him in advising God.                          The spiritual mathematics          Who would stand before a blackboard, and pray the         principle of mathematics to solve the problem? The 3:6     rule is already established, and it is our         task to work out the solution. Shall we         ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own 3:9     work? His work is done, and we have only to avail         ourselves of God's rule in order to receive His bless-         ing, which enables us to work out our own salvation.  3:12    The Divine Being must be reflected by man, - else         man is not the image and likeness of the patient,         tender, and true, the One \"altogether lovely;\" but to 3:15    understand God is the work of eternity, and demands         absolute consecration of thought, energy, and desire.                            Prayerful ingratitude          How empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit 3:18    theoretically that God is good, omnipotent, omni-         present, infinite, and then we try to give         information to this infinite Mind. We plead 3:21    for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of         benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good         already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the 3:24    blessings we have, and thus be fitted to receive more.         Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of         thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than speech.  3:27    If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and         yet return thanks to God for all blessings, we are in-         sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro- 3:30    nounces on hypocrites. In such a case, the only         acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and         remember our blessings. While the heart is far from 4:1     divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the ingrati-         tude of barren lives.                            Efficacious petitions  4:3     What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire         for growth in grace, expressed in patience, meekness,         love, and good deeds. To keep the com- 4:6     mandments of our Master and follow his         example, is our proper debt to him and the only         worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has 4:9     done. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to         express loyal and heartfelt gratitude, since he has         said: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\"  4:12    The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas-         ing prayer. Its motives are made manifest in the         blessings they bring,- blessings which, even if not 4:15    acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness         to be partakers of Love.                           Watchfulness requisite          Simply asking that we may love God will never 4:18    make us love Him; but the longing to be better         and holier, expressed in daily watchful-         ness and in striving to assimilate more of 4:21    the divine character, will mould and fashion us         anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the         Science of Christianity through demonstration of the 4:24    divine nature; but in this wicked world goodness         will \"be evil spoken of,\" and patience must bring         experience.                             Veritable devotion  4:27    Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual         understanding, which regenerates; but silent prayer,         watchfulness, and devout obedience enable 4:30    us to follow Jesus' example. Long prayers,         superstition, and creeds clip the strong pinions of love,         and clothe religion in human forms. Whatever mate- 5:1     rializes worship hinders man's spiritual growth and keeps         him from demonstrating his power over error.                           Sorrow and reformation  5:3     Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform         and the very easiest step. The next and great step re-         quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity, 5:6     - namely, reformation. To this end we are         placed under the stress of circumstances. Temptation         bids us repeat the offence, and woe comes in return for 5:9     what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that there         is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay         \"the uttermost farthing.\" The measure ye mete \"shall 5:12    be measured to you again,\" and it will be full \"and run-         ning over.\"          Saints and sinners get their full award, but not always 5:15    in this world. The followers of Christ drank his cup.         Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim; but God         pours the riches of His love into the understanding and 5:18    affections, giving"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],["title","Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#2)"],["body"," strength according to our day. Sin-         ners flourish \"like a green bay tree;\" but, looking farther,         the Psalmist could see their end, - the destruction of sin 5:21    through suffering.                          Cancellation of human sin          Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin.         Such an error would impede true religion. Sin is forgiven 5:24    only as it is destroyed by Christ, - Truth and         Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is         cancelled, and that man is made better merely by praying, 5:27    prayer is an evil. He grows worse who continues in sin         because he fancies himself forgiven.                             Diabolism destroyed          An apostle says that the Son of God [Christ] came to 5:30    \"destroy the /works/ of the devil.\" We should         follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the de-         struction of all evil works, error and disease included. 6:1     We cannot escape the penalty due for sin. The Scrip-         tures say, that if we deny Christ, \" he also will deny us.\"                            Pardon and amendment  6:3     Divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may         pardon, but this divine Principle alone reforms the         sinner. God is not separate from the wis- 6:6     dom He bestows. The talents He gives we         must improve. Calling on Him to forgive our work         badly done or left undone, implies the vain supposition 6:9     that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and         that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.          To cause suffering as the result of sin, is the means 6:12    of destroying sin. Every supposed pleasure in sin         will furnish more than its equivalent of pain, until be-         lief in material life and sin is destroyed. To reach 6:15    heaven, the harmony of being, we must understand         the divine Principle of being.                          Mercy without partiality          \"God is Love.\" More than this we cannot ask, 6:18    higher we cannot look, farther we cannot go. To         suppose that God forgives or punishes sin         according as His mercy is sought or un- 6:21    sought, is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer         the safety-valve for wrong-doing.                               Divine severity          Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it 6:24    out. Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound         her, and to Peter he said, \"Thou art an of-         fence unto me.\" He came teaching and 6:27    showing men how to destroy sin, sickness, and death.         He said of the fruitless tree, \"[It] is hewn down.\"          It is believed by many that a certain magistrate, 6:30    who lived in the time of Jesus, left this record: \"His         rebuke is fearful.\" The strong language of our Mas-         ter confirms this description.  7:1     The only civil sentence which he had for error was,         \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" Still stronger evidence 7:3     that Jesus' reproof was pointed and pungent is found         in his own words,- showing the necessity for such         forcible utterance, when he cast out devils and healed 7:6     the sick and sinning. The relinquishment of error de-         prives material sense of its false claims.                               Audible praying          Audible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary 7:9     solemnity and elevation to thought. But does it pro-         duce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply         into these things, we find that \"a zeal . . . 7:12    not according to knowledge\" gives occasion for reac-         tion unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve, and         wholesome perception of God's requirements. The mo- 7:15    tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of         applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment.                            Emotional utterances          Physical sensation, not Soul, produces material ec- 7:18    stasy and emotion. If spiritual sense always guided         men, there would grow out of ecstatic mo-         ments a higher experience and a better life 7:21    with more devout self-abnegation and purity. A self-         satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes         a Christian. God is not influenced by man. The \"di- 7:24    vine ear\" is not an auditory nerve. It is the all-hearing         and all-knowing Mind, to whom each need of man is         always known and by whom it will be supplied.                         Danger from audible prayer  7:27    The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp-         tation. By it we may become involuntary hypocrites, ut-         tering desires which are not real and consoling 7:30    ourselves in the midst of sin with the recollection         that we have prayed over it or mean to ask for-         giveness at some later day. Hypocrisy is fatal to religion.  8:1     A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-         justification, though it makes the sinner a hypocrite. 8:3     We never need to despair of an honest heart; but         there is little hope for those who come only spasmodi-         cally face to face with their wickedness and then seek to 8:6     hide it. Their prayers are indexes which do not correspond         with their character. They hold secret fellowship with         sin, and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as \"like 8:9     unto whited sepulchres . . . full . . . of all uncleanness.\"                             Aspiration and love          If a man, though apparently fervent and prayerful,         is impure and therefore insincere, what must be the 8:12    comment upon him? If he reached the         loftiness of his prayer, there would be no         occasion for comment. If we feel the aspiration, hu- 8:15    mility, gratitude, and love which our words express,-         this God accepts; and it is wise not to try to deceive         ourselves or others, for \"there is nothing covered that 8:18    shall not be revealed.\" Professions and audible pray-         ers are like charity in one respect,- they \"cover the         multitude of sins.\" Praying for humility with what- 8:21    ever fervency of expression does not always mean a         desire for it. If we turn away from the poor, we are         not ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses 8:24    the poor. We confess to having a very wicked heart         and ask that it may be laid bare before us, but do         we not already know more of this heart than we are 8:27    willing to have our neighbor see?                             Searching the heart          We should examine ourselves and learn what is the         affection and purpose of the heart, for in this way 8:30    only can we learn what we honestly are. If a         friend informs us of a fault, do we listen pa-         tiently to the rebuke and credit what is said? Do we not 9:1     rather give thanks that we are \"not as other men\"?         During many years the author has been most grateful 9:3     for merited rebuke. The wrong lies in unmerited cen-         sure,- in the falsehood which does no one any good.                            Summit of aspiration          The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these 9:6     questions: Do we love our neighbor better because of         this asking? Do we pursue the old selfish-         ness, satisfied with having prayed for some- 9:9     thing better, though we give no evidence of the sin-         cerity of our requests by living consistently with our         prayer? If selfishness has given place to kindness, 9:12    we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly, and bless         them that curse us; but we shall never meet this great         duty simply by asking that it may be done. There is 9:15    a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition         of our hope and faith.                             Practical religion          Dost thou \"love the Lord thy God with all thy 9:18    heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\"?         This command includes much, even the sur-         render of all merely material sensation, affec- 9:21    tion, and worship. This is the El Dorado of Christianity.         It involves the Science of Life, and recognizes only the         divine control of Spirit, in which Soul is our master, 9:24    and material sense and human will have no place.                           The chalice sacrificial          Are you willing to leave all for Christ, for Truth, and         so be counted among sinners? No! Do you really desire 9:27    to attain this point? No! Then why make long         prayers about it and ask to be Christians,         since you do not care to tread in the footsteps of our 9:30    dear Master? If unwilling to follow his example, why         pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his         nature? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right. 10:1    Prayer means that we desire to walk and will walk in         the light so far as we receive it, even though with bleed- 10:3    ing footsteps, and that waiting patiently on the Lord,         we will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him.          The world must grow to the spiritual understanding 10:6    of prayer. If good enough to profit by Jesus' cup of         earthly sorrows, God will sustain us under these sor-         rows. Until we are thus divinely qualified and are 10:9    willing to drink his cup, millions of vain repetitions         will never pour into prayer the unction of Spirit in         demonstration of power and \"with signs following.\" 10:12   Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the         world, the flesh, and evil, and thus destroying all error.          Seeking is not sufficient. It is striving that enables 10:15   us to enter. Spiritual attainments open the door to a         higher understanding of the divine Life.
