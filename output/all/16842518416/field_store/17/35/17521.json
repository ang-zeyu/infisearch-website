The species occurs in Nevada only near that state's western and northern boundaries. The range is therefore much different than it has been depicted heretofore, with the populations living east of the Continental Divide widely separated from those to the west for the entire length of the Rocky Mountains south of the Yellowstone National Park region. The populations of northern Utah, southern Idaho, and Nevada, which have been considered _parietalis_ are thus far removed from the main population of that subspecies to the east and are isolated from them by the barrier of the Continental Divide and arid regions farther west.  Although some of the records published for _Thamnophis sirtalis_ are erroneous, being based on misidentifications of other species, various outlying records, including those in western Kansas, the Panhandle of Texas, and southeastern New Mexico probably represent localized relict populations that have survived from a time when the species was more generally distributed in this region. The population of _T. sirtalis_ in the Río Grande drainage of New Mexico is geographically isolated and remote from other populations of the species. Except for a few isolated and highly localized populations the species is absent from the Republican, Smoky Hill, Arkansas, Cimarron, Canadian, Red, Brazos, Colorado and Pecos rivers and their tributaries west of the one hundredth meridian in the arid High Plains.  Streams in this region of High Plains are in most instances unsuitable habitats because they are in eroded channels, have a variable and uncertain water supply, and have poorly developed riparian communities. The marsh and wet meadow habitat preferred by _sirtalis_ in most parts of its range is almost absent. _T. radix_ and _T. marcianus_, well adapted to conditions in this region, perhaps provide competition that is limiting to _T. sirtalis_. However, several well-isolated populations of _sirtalis_ have survived as relicts in the southern Great Plains, presumably from a time several thousand years ago when mesic conditions were more prevalent, perhaps in an early postglacial stage.         *       *       *       *       *  Illustration: FIG. 1.

Records from Idaho and Wyoming are based on specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History collection. Other records are based on Woodbury (1931) for Utah, Hudson (1942) for Nebraska, Maslin (1959) for Colorado, Smith (1956) for Kansas, R. G. Webb (MS) for Oklahoma, Brown (1950) and Fouquette and Lindsay (1955) for Texas, Cope (1900), Van Denburgh (1924), Little and Keller (1937) for New Mexico, and Smith and Taylor (1945) for Mexico.         *       *       *       *       *  Smith (1956:292) recorded _parietalis_ from three outlying stations in the western quarter of Kansas, from Wallace, Hamilton and Meade counties in the drainages of the Smoky Hill River, Arkansas River, and Cimarron River, respectively. Permanent springs in Meade County State Park perhaps account for the survival of an isolated colony there. Several specimens from that locality seen by Fitch in August, 1960, when recently collected by a University of Michigan field party, seemed to be of the Texas subspecies _annectens_, as their dorsal stripes were reddish orange, and markings on the dorsolateral area were pale yellow rather than red. Specimens from the Texas Panhandle, from Hemphill County (Brown, 1950:207) and nine miles east of Stinnet, Hutchison County (Fouquette and Lindsay, 1955:417) likewise are most nearly like _annectens_ judging from the authors' descriptions. The specimens from nine miles east of Stinnet averaged large; the two largest would have attained or slightly exceeded four feet in length if they had had complete tails. No _sirtalis_ so long as four feet has been recorded elsewhere.  Records are lacking from the drainages of the Republican, North Canadian, Brazos and Colorado River drainages in the High Plains, but possibly isolated populations occur in some of these also. The only record from the Pecos River drainage is that of Bundy (1951:314) from Wade's Swamp near Artesia, Eddy County, New Mexico. This locality is separated by some 140 miles from any other known station of occurrence.  From extreme southern Colorado south across New Mexico to the Mexican border _T. sirtalis_ occurs in continuous or nearly continuous populations in the Río Grande Valley, and has been recorded from many localities. It has been recorded from relatively few localities of tributary streams (Los Pinos, Abiqui, Santa Fe) all near the main valley. There is one record from the Ocate River, a headwaters tributary of the Canadian River, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains near other localities in the Río Grande drainage. The southwestern-most known locality of occurrence is Casas Grandes in the Mexican state of Chihuahua some 130 miles southwest of El Paso, Texas, and near the Continental Divide. The Río Casas Grandes must have once been a tributary of the Río Grande, but now its desert drainage basin is isolated.   RE-DESCRIPTION OF A SUBSPECIES FROM NEW MEXICO  Most specimens of a population of _sirtalis_ occurring in New Mexico are recognizably different from most specimens of other populations. This New Mexican population is therefore here recognized as a distinct subspecies:  THAMNOPHIS SIRTALIS ORNATA Baird    _Eutaenia ornata_ Baird, 1859:16.   _Eutaenia sirtalis dorsalis_ Cope, 1900:1076.   _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_ (part) Van Denburgh, 1924:222.      _Type._--U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, obtained at El Paso, Texas,     at some time in the eighteen fifties by Col. J. D. Graham.      _Range._--Río Grande and vicinity, from Conejos and Costilla     counties in extreme south-central Colorado south across New     Mexico to Mexican border. Records from neighboring drainage     systems, Casas Grandes in Chihuahua and Artesia and Ocate     River in New Mexico, probably also pertain to _ornata_.      _Description._--A specimen in the University of New Mexico     Natural History Museum (E. D. Flaherty No. 560, obtained     one mile west and one-half mile south of Isleta, Bernalillo     County, New Mexico, on May 31, 1959) was described as     follows while its colors were still but little altered by     preservatives: Top of head olive, supralabials pale gray,     edged with black posteriorly; chin milky white, with dark     edges posteriorly on fifth, sixth and seventh infralabials;     dorsal stripe yellow; including middorsal row of scales and     little more than adjacent half of row on either side of it;     dorsolateral area olive-brown with row of black spots on its     lower half, these spots elliptical, averaging about size     of one scale on anterior part of body, smaller posteriorly;     adjacent spots separated by interspaces of approximately     their own length, irregular black markings on upper half     of dorsolateral area not forming definite spots but fused     longitudinally to form continuous black border to dorsal     stripe; crescent-shaped red markings in areas between scale     rows three to nine, these markings invading edges of scales,     and themselves having ill-defined edges blending into the     darker ground color; lateral stripe pale, yellowish gray,     limited to scale rows two and three for most of its length,     but including rows four and five in neck region; row of     irregular black marks low on each side, with each mark     centering on anterior part of lower half of scale of first     row but overlapping onto corners of adjacent ventrals;     approximately every other scale of first row so marked;     ventral surface pale, suffused with bluish tint; most of     ventrals marked on anterior edges with pair of semicircular     black spots, each situated about two-thirds of distance from     mid-line to lateral edge of ventral; these marks diminishing     in size and finally disappearing on posterior part of body;     ventral surface otherwise immaculate.      Lepidosis normal for genus and species, with preoculars single     on each side, supralabials 7-7, infralabials 8-8, ventrals     159, anal entire, subcaudals 77 (including terminal spine),     paired except for second, third and fourth; scale rows 19     from neck slightly beyond mid-body, fifth on left side ending     opposite 86th ventral; length from snout to vent 670 mm., tail     202 mm.      _Comparisons._--From _T. s. parietalis_, _T. s. ornata_     differs in its consistently pale ground color, olive instead     of dark brown or black. In respect to color-pattern _ornata_     stands in approximately the same relation to _parietalis_ as,     farther west, _T. s. infernalis_, a pale subspecies of the     California coast, stands in relation to _T. s. fitchi_.     Nevertheless, _fitchi_ consistently has a dark ground color,     whereas _parietalis_ is highly variable, and the color of an     occasional specimen (for example KU 17032 from Douglas County,     Kansas) matches _ornata_ in olive coloration. These unusually     pale specimens of _parietalis_ differ from _ornata_ in not     having a continuous black edge along each side of dorsal     stripe; black pigment of this area is concentrated into rows     of spots alternating with those of lower series. From _T. s.     infernalis_, _ornata_ differs in having paired black spots     on the ventrals and in having more than three"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33966"],["title","Occurrence of the Garter Snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, in the Great Plains and (#2)"],["body","of red     crescents on dorsolateral area of each side.  _Remarks._--The type of _ornata_ seems to have been lost, and the available information concerning it is far from satisfactory. In the original description, Baird listed three specimens, purportedly from \"Indianola, Texas\" (J. H. Clark, 438), from the Río Grande, Texas (J. H. Clark, 768), and from near San Antonio, Texas (Dr. Kennerley, no number). None of these three specimens could have been _ornata_ as conceived of by us because all were collected outside the geographic range of _ornata_. However, there was also included a plate with a drawing of a specimen and a reference to an earlier paper (Baird and Girard, 1853) in which a specimen obtained by Col. Graham \"Between San Antonio and El Paso\" was described. Smith and Brown (1946:72) have presented evidence that this specimen figured (rather than any of the three specifically mentioned) served as a basis for the plate, and they therefore considered it to be the holotype of _ornata_, even though Baird referred this specimen to \"_Eutaenia parietalis_ Say\" in the same paper (1859) in which the original description of _ornata_ was published. Cope (1900:1079) listed under _Eutaenia sirtalis parietalis_ a specimen, U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, from El Paso, obtained by Col. Graham, and referred to it as a type (without specifying of what it was the type). Smith and Brown (_loc. cit._) interpreted this statement by Cope as further evidence that the specimen in question should be considered the type of _ornata_, and they restricted the type locality, originally stated as \"between San Antonio and El Paso\" to \"El Paso.\" Actually all valid records of the species _sirtalis_ from the vicinity of the Río Grande are from the El Paso region or from farther north.  It is with some misgivings that we herewith accept the interpretation proposed by Smith and Brown regarding the applicability of the name _ornata_ and the designation by these authors of the now missing specimen from the region of El Paso as the holotype of that form. The evidence linking the name _ornata_ with the New Mexican subspecies is tenuous; there is some doubt as to the provenance of U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960 (the supposed type), and even more doubt as to whether this is the specimen depicted in the plate that formed part of the original description.  Cope (1900:1076) recognized as a distinct subspecies, _Eutaenia sirtalis dorsalis_, the same population that we recognize herein as _T. s. ornata_, and Smith (1942:98) considered the name _dorsalis_ to be a synonym of _T. s. parietalis_. However, it is almost certain that both authors misapplied the name, since the type of Baird's and Girard's (1853:31) _Eutainia dorsalis_ was obtained in Coahuila, Mexico, between Monclova and the Río Grande, far south of the known range limits of _T. sirtalis_ in Texas. The description does not fit _T. sirtalis_ and almost certainly pertains to another species.      _Specimens examined._--Univ. of Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.     (hereafter abbreviated to \"KU\") Nos. 5479 to 5497, from the     north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, Sierra County, New     Mexico, and 8592 and 8593 from near Las Lunas, Valencia     County, New Mexico; Univ. of New Mexico Mus. Nos. 571 and     572 (J. S. Findley) from 2 miles west and 1/4 mile north of     Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, and No. 4021 (E.     D. Flaherty) from 1 mile west and 1/2 mile south of Isleta,     Bernalillo County, New Mexico.   DESCRIPTION OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_  From most of the vast area occupied by _parietalis_, material has not been available to us, and our concept of this subspecies is based chiefly on specimens and living material from Kansas and northeastern Colorado. A total of 520 live _parietalis_ has been examined from the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation some 130 miles south and a little east of the type locality in Nebraska. These probably differ but little from typical specimens. The range of individual variation in pattern is especially notable. In those from the Reservation, the ground color varies from dull olive-brown to almost jet black. The markings on the dorsolateral area vary in color, in shade and in extent. These marks are chiefly confined to the skin between the scales of rows three to nine. Although most typically these marks are of some shade of red (hence the name \"red-sided garter snake\"), they may be pale buff, or pale greenish yellow, or may even have a bluish tint. In approximately ten per cent of the specimens from the Reservation there is no red at all in the pattern, which hence is similar to that of _T. s. sirtalis_ in the eastern United States. Only a minority have all the dorsolateral marks red, and in some of these specimens the marks higher on the sides are progressively paler red, having a bleached out appearance. Most typically the marks between rows three to six are some shade of red while the smaller marks between rows six to nine are pale--yellowish, greenish, or buffy. In some the pale area of the lateral stripe is in varying degrees suffused with red, which may extend onto the edges of the ventrals and even to the underside of the tail.  _T. s. parietalis_ may be diagnosed, on the basis of these snakes from northeastern Kansas, as follows: Size medium large (length 23.5 to 34.5, or, exceptionally 43.5 inches in adult males; 32.5 to 46.0 inches in adult females), dorsolateral color olive to black. Approximately every other scale of the third row is bordered above and anteriorly by a crescent-shaped area of scarlet colored skin. Similar crescent-shaped areas border the scales of the fourth and fifth rows and often two adjacent crescents meet at the ends of an intervening scale and fuse forming an H-shaped mark. Placed alternately with these markings are similar but smaller crescent-shaped markings on the skin of the upper half of the dorsolateral area on each side bordering every other scale of the sixth, seventh and eighth rows. The crescents of this upper series also may fuse to form series of H-shaped markings alternating with those of the lower series. The dorsal stripe is yellow with a faint dusky suffusion; it involves all of the middorsal scale row and approximately the adjacent half of the row on either side. The lateral stripe is faint, yellowish gray, chiefly on the upper half of the second scale row, lower half of third, and the intervening skin, and is often invaded or suffused by the red marks of the dorsolateral area. The first scale row, adjacent corners of the ventrals, and lower half of the second scale row are suffused with dark pigment and appear dusky, but this area is often marked with black, setting off the paler area of the lateral stripe. The ventrals are dull, whitish, faintly suffused with yellowish, greenish or bluish, each ventral having a black dot usually of semicircular shape on its anterior margin near the anterolateral corner.   COMPARISON OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_ AND _T. S. FITCHI_  Like most widely ranging subspecies, _parietalis_ and _fitchi_ vary geographically and local populations often are noticeably different from typical material. It is possible that future revisors will recognize additional subspecies, but in the variant populations known to us the degree of differentiation is slight as compared, for instance, with that in the subspecies of _Thamnophis elegans_. Scalation is remarkably uniform in all the subspecies of _sirtalis_, but coastal and northern populations tend to have fewer ventrals and subcaudals than do their counterparts farther inland and farther south. In their geographic variation the ventrals and subcaudals follow clines, and do not in themselves warrant subspecific divisions. Variation occurs chiefly in the color and pattern including the intensity of dark pigmentation of the dorsolateral area, head, ventral surface and lower edge of the lateral stripe; in extent, position and shade of red or pale colored markings on the dorsolateral area; in presence and extent of reddish suffusion on the head, in the region of the lateral stripe, and on the ventral surface of the tail. Most of these same characters vary within the subspecies _fitchi_, but the range of variation is relatively minor. Fitch (_op. cit._:582-584) described typical populations and also described briefly several small series from British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and California which were not entirely typical. Most frequent variation was in heavy reddish suffusion on the sides of the head not found in typical _fitchi_. In each local population of this subspecies the characters seem to be remarkably uniform and stable.         *       *       *       *       *  Illustration: FIG. 2.
