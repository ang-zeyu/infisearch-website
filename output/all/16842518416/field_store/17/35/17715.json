It is one of a group of favorite oratorios which have found a warm place in the hearts of the people. With it stand _The Messiah_, _Judas Maccabaeus_, _St. Paul_ and _Elijah_. Do you know who composed each of these?  After the English journeys, Haydn lived quietly in Vienna in what is now known as the Haydn house. Should you ever go to Vienna you will be welcomed there by the caretaker, who will show you the rooms in which Haydn lived.  One day toward the end of his life he asked his servant to carry him to the piano. While the members of his household stood near him he played three times, very solemnly, the _Emperor's Song_.

SMITH   Preparation of a handbook of reptiles and amphibians by the junior author has led to a survey of the collections of these animals at Kansas State Teachers College in Emporia. Numerous locality records of interest and importance have been accumulated there through the efforts of the senior author and a number of his students, particularly Mr. Allen Downs. The more important records, including the first record for Kansas of _Rana sylvatica_, are reported here. We have not mentioned specimens that are from counties from which the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History already has specimens.  Specimens examined by Smith are indicated by an asterisk *; those identified by the late Dr. F. N. Blanchard are indicated by an encircled period ¤ (none of these specimens are now available). All other specimens here recorded have been examined either by the senior author or by Mr. Allen Downs, or by both. Specimen numbers, unless otherwise indicated, are those of the Kansas State Teachers College collection.  #Triturus viridescens louisianensis# (Wolterstorff), Newt.--_Cherokee Co._: 1 mile north and 4 miles east of Crestline (No. 164).* This is a terrestrial adult, and provides the second known locality for the species in the state.  #Ambystoma texanum# (Matthes), Narrow-mouthed Salamander.--_Lyon Co._: Emporia.  #Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium# (Baird), Tiger Salamander.--_Lyon Co._: (No. 292); 2 miles east of Americus. _Ness Co._: Ness City (No. 591).  #Scaphiopus bombifrons# Cope, Plains Spadefoot.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 592).  #Bufo americanus americanus# (Holbrook), American Toad.--_Chase Co._: 10 miles southwest of Saffordville. _Cherokee Co._: 4 miles southeast of Columbus. _Lyon Co._: 6 miles south of Plymouth (No. 290)*; Emporia (Nos. 442, 443).* The records from Chase and Lyon counties represent the westernmost localities for the species in Kansas.  #Bufo cognatus# Say, Great Plains Toad.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 594).  #Bufo woodhousii woodhousii# (Girard), Rocky Mountain Toad.--_Clark Co._: 11 miles south of Bucklin (No. 401).* _Decatur Co._: Sappa Creek near Oberlin (2 spec.).* _Ford. Co._: 5 miles southwest of Dodge City (1 spec.).* _Lyon Co._: Emporia (No. 352).* _Ness Co._: Ness City (Nos. 502-504, 595, 596)*; 4 miles west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 593).* _Sheridan Co._: Sheridan County State Park (Nos. 565-568).  #Acris crepitans# Baird, Northern Cricket Frog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 506, 507, 597-606).*  #Pseudacris nigrita triseriata# (Wied), Striped Chorus Frog.--_Lyon Co._: 10 miles south of Plymouth; 3 miles north of Emporia (No. 300); 7 miles west of Olpe; 2 miles northeast of Emporia (Nos. 434-441).* _Neosho Co._: 3 miles west of Erie.  #Hyla versicolor versicolor# (Le Conte), Common Tree Toad.--_Chautauqua Co._: Elk City (No. 621).  #Rana catesbeiana# Shaw, Bullfrog.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 607).* _Wallace Co._: 3 miles east of Sharon Springs (1 spec.).*  #Rana pipiens brachycephala# Cope, Leopard Frog.--_Clark Co._: 11 miles south of Bucklin (Nos. 398-400).* _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 505, 508, 509, 608).*  #Rana sylvatica cantabrigensis# Baird, Wood Frog.--_Lyon Co._: extreme southwestern corner, 3 miles east of Chase County line, between the Verdigris River and the corner of the county (1 specimen, now Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kans., No. 23149).* This specimen provides for the first time a basis for inclusion of the species in the fauna of Kansas. It measures 50 mm. snout to vent; hind leg from vent 80 mm.; tibia 23 mm. The ratio of hind leg to snout-vent measurement is 0.625, and that of the tibia to snout-vent measurement is 2.17. Both figures are too high for _Rana s. sylvatica_, in which the former ratio varies between 0.53 and 0.62, the latter ratio between 1.6 and 1.88. The ratios agree well with those of _R. s. cantabrigensis_, in which the former ratio varies from 0.62 to 0.75, the latter from 1.93 to 2.3. Direct comparison of the specimen with typical examples of both subspecies substantiates its allocation to _R. s. cantabrigensis_.  In the vicinity of Kansas, specimens of this species are known from Missouri (St. Louis and Stone Counties only) and northwestern Arkansas (Washington County: Winslow and Prairie Grove, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kans., Nos. 16526, 18820, 18823). Reëxamination of these specimens confirms their identity as _Rana sylvatica sylvatica_ to which the Missouri specimens from Stone County undoubtedly also belong. Accordingly this race is still to be anticipated in extreme southeastern Kansas.  Reference of the specimen from Lyon County to _Rana s. cantabrigensis_ presents a problem in distribution, for the race is not known from nearer Kansas than North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and southern Illinois, except for a record given by Cope (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 34:437, 1889) from \"western Missouri.\" Hurter (Trans. St. Louis Acad. Sci., 20:123, 1911) restricts this record to Cooper County, and presumably verifies Cope's identification. Hurter, too, recognized the other form, _R. sylvatica_, in Missouri (Marble Cave, Stone County). Cope distinguished between the two races (as they are now recognized) and recorded typical _R. sylvatica_ from St. Louis. Accordingly the specimen from Cooper County may be considered properly identified racially. It apparently is from the locality nearest to Kansas at which the race has been taken.  It seems highly probable that the Kansas occurrence, and possibly those in Arkansas and Missouri also, is a relict one. It is highly improbable that the species has a continuous distribution in either state. A wider or more southern distribution in the past seems evident. The group to which it belongs certainly has had a more southern range, as indicated by Taylor's discovery in Meade County, Kansas (Univ. Kans. Sci. Bull., 28:217, 1942), of a fossil species of _Rana_ (_parvissima_), from the Upper Pliocene, presumably related to _sylvatica_. It may or may not have been a direct ancestor of the living species.  #Microhyla olivacea# (Hallowell), Northern Narrow-mouthed Toad.--_Lyon Co._: 6 miles southwest of Emporia. _Wilson Co._: 7 miles northeast of Fall River.  #Crotaphytus collaris collaris# (Say), Collared Lizard.--_Geary Co._: 4 miles south of Fort Riley. _Wabaunsee Co._: 2 miles northeast of Alma.  #Holbrookia maculata maculata# (Girard), Earless Lizard.--_Chase Co._: 7 miles south of Saffordville (No. 350)*; 6 miles southwest of Saffordville; 1 mile south of Saffordville (No. 338)*; 10 miles southwest of Olpe. _Hodgeman Co._: Jetmore. _Lyon Co._: 5 miles south of Plymouth; 6 miles southeast of Emporia; 9 miles southwest of Emporia. _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 480, 481, 484-497, 609-611)*, 6 miles west and 0.5 miles south of Ness City (Nos. 482, 483, 498).*  #Sceloporus undulatus garmani# Boulenger, Northern Plains Lizard.--_Ellsworth Co._: Carneiro; 10 miles south of Ellsworth. _McPherson Co._: 4 miles west of Roxbury (No. 133). _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 479, 612).*  #Phrynosoma cornutum# (Harlan), Texas Horned Lizard.--_Ellsworth Co._: 10 miles south of Ellsworth. _Lyon Co._: 1 mile south of Emporia; 8 miles southwest of Emporia. _Saline Co._: Coronado Heights; 3 miles northwest of Lindsborg.  #Ophisaurus ventralis# (Linnaeus), Glass-snake Lizard.--_Lyon Co._: Emporia; 1 mile southwest of Emporia (No. 288).* _Rooks Co._: 5 miles southwest of Stockton (No. 407).*  #Cnemidophorus sexlineatus# (Linnaeus), Six-lined Racerunner.--_Ellsworth Co._: Carneiro. _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles northwest of Reading. _Shawnee Co._: 5 miles east of Topeka (No. 14).*  #Leiolopisma laterale# (Say), Brown Skink.--_Labette Co._: 7 miles northwest of Mound Valley (No. 301).* _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles northwest of Reading. _Wilson Co._: 4 miles southwest of Coyville (No. 281).*  #Eumeces fasciatus# (Linnaeus), Common Five-lined Skink.--_Bourbon Co._: 1 mile north of Fulton. _Chase Co._: 7 miles southwest of Saffordville; 6 miles south of Clements; 2 miles south of Saffordville. _Franklin Co._: 8 miles east of Ottawa; 2 miles south of Ottawa; 2 miles southwest of Lane; 4 miles east of Ottawa; 5 miles southwest of Ottawa. _Labette Co._: 2 miles southwest of Dennis; 7 miles northwest of Mound Valley. _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles northwest of Reading. _Miami Co._: 2.5 miles south of Fontana. _Montgomery Co._: 5 miles west of Independence. _Neosho Co._: 4 miles northwest of Erie (No. 318).*  #Eumeces obsoletus# (Baird and Girard), Sonoran Skink.-"]]]
