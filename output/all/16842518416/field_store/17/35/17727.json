Tuft on female scutellum light fulvous. The female, from Kalacoon, (Hym. 212) is the type of the variety.   #Euglossa ignita# Smith, var. #chlorosoma#, new variety  Green, without coppery tints, but variably suffused with purple. It is smaller than _E. piliventris_, with shorter mouth-parts, and the labrum pallid with a pair of dusky spots. A male in the U. S. Nat. Museum from Bartica, which I reported as _E. piliventris_, belongs here. Female _E. piliventris_ has long yellow hairs on the anterior margin of hind basitarsus, but in _chlorosoma_ the hair in this situation is black. The type of the variety is a female labelled Hym. 140. A female from Kalacoon has brassy and coppery tints on the apical part of abdomen, and must be referred to _E. ignita_ proper. The type locality of _ignita_ is Jamaica.  #Ceratina læta# Spinola. This was described from the female. The specimen sent is a male, and differs from the female in being smaller, and having a transverse band on anterior margin of clypeus, triangular marks on lower corners of face, and a large patch (emarginate above) on labrum all ivory-white. This is very like _C. viridula_ Smith, which Ducke considers a synonym of _læta_, but the base of the metathorax seems to differ, and the nervures are piceous. For the present, therefore, I retain _C. viridula_ as a distinct species. The female of _C. viridula_, collected by Busck in the Panama Canal Zone, is also distinguishable from that sex of _C. læta_.   #Epicharis maculata# var. #barticana#, new variety  [Female].--Base of mandibles with a large cuneiform yellow mark; a broad black band down each side of labrum; yellow spots on prothorax large; scutellum with a pair of large transversely oval yellow areas, separated by a narrow black band; band on second abdominal segment with a posterior median projection. Kalacoon, 1916. (Hym. 217.)   #Rhathymus beebei#, new species  [Female].--Length about 22 mm., anterior wing 18 mm.; head clear ferruginous, with red hair, lower part of face more pallid, with a creamy tint; apical half of mandibles black; clypeus prominent, minutely roughened, with a smooth median line; mesothorax black, with a median ridge, the surface on each side of this strongly punctured, but shining between the punctures; rest of thorax ferruginous, and all of thorax with ferruginous hair; scutellum not bigibbous, but with an elevated transverse ridge; pleura with a blackish area below the wings; lower part of mesopleura with a shining tubercle; tegulæ clear ferruginous, finely punctured; wings strongly reddened; legs clear ferruginous; abdomen fusiform, shining; first two segments dull reddish, pallid posterolaterally, the others reddish black, with the hind margins redder; apical plate very large, concave. Bartica District (Hym. 19). Very distinct by the transverse straight ridge on scutellum; nearest perhaps to the considerably smaller _R. unicolor_ Smith, but that has dark fuscous wings. The antennæ are unfortunately missing.   #Augochlora callichlorura#, new species  [Female].--Length a little over 7 mm.; first two abdominal segments rather weakly vibrissate on hind margin with orange hairs; hind spur of hind leg with long spines. Head and thorax very dark purplish, nearly black, but a blue-green spot at upper end of clypeus, supraclypeal area brilliant purple, and base of metathorax strongly tinged with purple; anterior and middle legs dark, with weak purple tints, but hind femora, tibiæ and basal half of basitarsi all brilliant green on outer side; abdomen short and broad, shining, very brilliant emerald green. Head broad, eyes strongly converging below; clypeus with extremely large punctures; front dull and granular; ocelli ordinary; cheeks with thin white hair; mesothorax and scutellum shining, but well punctured; base of metathorax with strong short plicæ; angles of prothorax not prominent; tegulæ rufotestaceous; wings grayish translucent, stigma and nervures dusky pale brown; first recurrent nervure meeting second transversocubital; abdomen with thin pale hair, hind margins of segments not darkened. Bartica District.  Unique by the combination of purplish head and thorax and green abdomen, the general effect recalling _A. atropos_ Smith.   #Florilegus barticanus#, new species.  [Male].--Length about 11 mm.; black, except as follows: first abdominal segment strongly greenish; clypeus and labrum entirely yellow; mandibles fulvous apically (but base black); antennæ, except the first two joints, ferruginous beneath; hind tarsi, and apex of hind tibiæ, dusky red; hair of head and thorax ferruginous, paler below, no admixture of dark hairs; eyes reddish; mesothorax shining, but distinctly punctured; tegulæ clear ferruginous; wings dusky hyaline, nervures reddish fuscous; legs with pale hair, conspicuously plumose on hind tibiæ; abdomen with four broad dense ochraceous hair-bands, that on fourth segment broadly excavated in middle posteriorly, on fifth broadly interrupted; sixth segment with a small patch of fulvous hair on each side; apical part of abdomen dorsally, except for the bands and patches, with very dark fuscous hair. Bartica District (Hym. 11).  Related to _F. lanieri_ Guér. from Cuba and _F. condigna_ Cresson from the United States. In the coloration of the legs it is intermediate between these two.  #Tetrapedia lacteipennis# Vachal.--It should be added to Vachal's description, that the dorsal abdominal segments 2 to 4 have yellow bands.  The Bartica collection contains a _Megalopta_ from Hoorie, but it is unfortunately broken. I have _Megalopta panamensis_ Cockerell from Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Museum, 42).  I add the description of a new species from French Guiana, the type of which is in my collection.   #Augochlora maroniana#, new species  [Female].--Length slightly over 8 mm.; head, thorax and legs bright green; abdomen yellowish green strongly suffused with coppery, the first two segments with apical fringes of orange hair; face rather narrow; antennæ black; lower middle of clypeus black; mesothorax and scutellum rough with dense punctatures, the scutellum with two copper-red spots; area of metathorax with very feeble plicæ; tegulæ black with pallid margin, the basal side broadly green; wings dusky; second s. m. square; first r. n. meeting second t. c; stigma dusky reddish; legs with mainly pale hair, hind tibiæ with dark hair on outer side basally; hind spur with about six long spines; basal half of basitarsi green on outer side; abdomen shining, with pale ochreus hair.  Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Mus., 43). Related to _A. cupreola_ (Ckll.), but with the vibrissate fringes on abdomen nearly twice as long, and deep orange-fulvous, and the mesothorax much more densely punctured. Also related to _A. diversipennis_ (Lep.), but with the face much narrower, and the area of metathorax much less distinctly plicate. From _A. calypso_ Sm. it is known by the wings not being yellowish, the inner orbits not edged with blue, and the tarsi not ferruginous.

The wakeful shepherd beholds vi:3    the first faint morning beams, ere cometh the full radiance         of a risen day. So shone the pale star to the prophet-         shepherds; yet it traversed the night, and came where, in vi:6    cradled obscurity, lay the Bethlehem babe, the human         herald of Christ, Truth, who would make plain to be-         nighted understanding the way of salvation through Christ vi:9    Jesus, till across a night of error should dawn the morn-         ing beams and shine the guiding star of being. The Wise-         men were led to behold and to follow this daystar of vi:12   divine Science, lighting the way to eternal harmony.          The time for thinkers has come. Truth, independent         of doctrines and time-honored systems, knocks at the vi:15   portal of humanity. Contentment with the past and         the cold conventionality of materialism are crumbling         away. Ignorance of God is no longer the stepping- vi:18   stone to faith. The only guarantee of obedience is a         right apprehension of Him whom to know aright is         Life eternal. Though empires fall, \"the Lord shall vi:21   reign forever.\"          A book introduces new thoughts, but it cannot make         them speedily understood. It is the task of the sturdy vi:24   pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough         granite. Future ages must declare what the pioneer         has accomplished.  vi:27   Since the author's discovery of the might of Truth in vii:1   the treatment of disease as well as of sin, her system has         been fully tested and has not been found wanting; but vii:3   to reach the heights of Christian Science, man must live         in obedience to its divine Principle. To develop the full         might of this Science, the discords of corporeal sense vii:6   must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense, even as the         science of music corrects false tones and gives sweet con-         cord to sound.  vii:9   Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and         matter are real and good, whereas the fact is that         Spirit is good and real, and matter is Spirit's oppo- vii:12  site. The question, What is Truth, is answered by         demonstration, by healing both disease and sin; and         this demonstration shows that Christian healing con- vii:15  fers the most health and makes the best men. On this         basis Christian Science will have a fair fight. Sickness         has been combated for centuries by doctors using ma- vii:18  terial remedies; but the question arises, Is there less         sickness because of these practitioners? A vigorous         \"No\" is the response deducible from two connate vii:21  facts, - the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians,         and the rapid multiplication and increased violence of         diseases since the flood.  vii:24  In the author's work, RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPEC-         TION, may be found a biographical sketch, narrating         experiences which led her, in the year 1866, to the dis- vii:27  covery of the system that she denominated Christian         Science. As early as 1862 she began to write down and         give to friends the results of her Scriptural study, for vii:30  the Bible was her sole teacher; but these compositions         were crude, the first steps of a child in the newly dis-         covered world of Spirit.  ix:1    She also began to jot down her thoughts on the         main subject, but these jottings were only infantile ix:3    lispings of Truth. A child drinks in the outward world         through the eyes and rejoices in the draught. He is         as sure of the world's existence as he is of his own; yet ix:6    he cannot describe the world. He finds a few words,         and with these he stammeringly attempts to convey his         feeling. Later, the tongue voices the more definite ix:9    thought, though still imperfectly.          So was it with the author. As a certain poet says of         himself, she \"lisped in numbers, for the numbers ix:12   came.\" Certain essays written at that early date are         still in circulation among her first pupils; but they are         feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of ix:15   Christian healing, and are not complete nor satisfac-         tory expositions of Truth. To-day, though rejoicing         in some progress, she still finds herself a willing dis- ix:18   ciple at the heavenly gate, waiting for the Mind of         Christ.          Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copy- ix:21   righted in 1870; but it did not appear in print until         1876, as she had learned that this Science must be         1876, as she had learned that this Science must be         demonstrated by healing, before a work on the subject ix:24   could be profitably studied. From 1867 until 1875,         copies were, however, in friendly circulation.          Before writing this work, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, she ix:27   made copious notes of Scriptural exposition, which         have never been published. This was during the years         1867 and 1868. These efforts show her comparative ix:30   ignorance of the stupendous Life-problem up to that         time, and the degrees by which she came at length         to its solution; but she values them as a parent x:1     may treasure the memorials of a child's growth, and         she would not have them changed.  x:3     The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was pub-         lished in 1875. Various books on mental healing have         since been issued, most of them incorrect in theory x:6     and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH.         They regard the human mind as a healing agent,         whereas this mind is not a factor in the Principle of x:9     Christian Science. A few books, however, which are         based on this book, are useful.          The author has not compromised conscience to suit x:12    the general drift of thought, but has bluntly and hon-         estly given the text of Truth. She has made no effort         to embellish, elaborate, or treat in full detail so in- x:15    finite a theme. By thousands of well-authenticated         cases of healing, she and her students have proved the         worth of her teachings. These cases for the most part x:18    have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical         attendants. Few invalids will turn to God till all         physical supports have failed, because there is so little x:21    faith in His disposition and power to heal disease.          The divine Principle of healing is proved in the         personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth. Its x:24    purpose is good, and its practice is safer and more po-         tent than that of any other sanitary method. The un-         biased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth, x:27    and convinced of it. Only those quarrel with her         method who do not understand her meaning, or dis-         cerning the truth, come not to the light lest their x:30    works be reproved. No intellectual proficiency is req-         uisite in the learner, but sound morals are most de-         sirable.  xi:1    Many imagine that the phenomena of physical heal-         ing in Christian Science present only a phase of the xi:3    action of the human mind, which action in some unex-         plained way results in the cure of disease. On the con-         trary, Christian Science rationally explains that all xi:6    other pathological methods are the fruits of human         faith in matter, faith in the workings, not of Spirit,         but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science.  xi:9    The physical healing of Christian Science results         now, as in Jesus' time, from the operation of divine         Principle, before which sin and disease lose their real- xi:12   ity in human consciousness and disappear as naturally         and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and         sin to reformation. Now, as then, these mighty works xi:15   are not supernatural, but supremely natural. They are         the sign of Immanuel, or \"God with us,\" a divine         influence ever present in human consciousness and re- xi:18   peating itself, coming now as was promised aforetime,               To preach deliverance to the captives [of sense],              And recovering of sight to the blind, xi:21        To set at liberty them that are bruised.          When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel         to this age, there came also the charge to plant and xi:24   water His vineyard.          The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing         was started by the author with only one student in xi:27   Lynn, Massachusetts, about the year 1867. In 1881,         she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in         Boston, under the seal of the Commonwealth, a law xi:30"]]]
