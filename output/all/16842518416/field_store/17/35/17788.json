Wills was a pore harmless weed, so he kin pass; but look'ere--there ain't a drover, nor yet a bullock driver, nor yet a stock-keeper, from 'ere to 'ell that could n't 'a' bossed that expegition straight through to the Gulf, an' back agen, an' never turned a hair--with sich a season as Burke had. Don't sicken a man with yer Burke.  He burked that expegition, right enough. ''Howlt! Dis-MOUNT!' Grand style o' man for sich a contract! I tell you, that (explorer) died for want of his sherry an' biscakes.  Why, the ole man, here, seen him out beyond Menindie, with his----\"  \"Pardon me, Mosey--was Mr. Price connected with the expedition?\"  \"No (adj.) fear!\" growled Price resentfully.  \"Jist happened to be there with the (adj.) teams.  Went up with stores, an' come down with wool.\"  Willoughby, who probably had wept over the sufferings of Burke's party on their way to Menindie, seemed badly nonplussed.  He murmured acquiescence in Price's authority; and Mosey continued,  \"Well, the ole man, here, seen him camped, with his carpet, an' his bedsteed, an' (sheol) knows what paravinalia; an' a man nothin' to do but wait on him; an'--look here!--a cubbard made to fit one o' the camels, with compartments for his swell toggery, an'--as true as I'm a livin' sinner!-- one o' the compartments made distinctly o' purpose to hold his belltopper!\"  \"Quite so,\" replied Willoughby approvingly.  \"We must bear in mind that Burke had a position to uphold in the party; and that, to maintain subordination, a commander must differentiate himself by\"--  \"It's Gord's truth, anyhow,\" remarked Price, rousing his mind from a retrospect of its extensive past.  And, no doubt, the old man was right; for a relic, answering to Mosey's description, was sold by auction in Melbourne, with other assets of the expedition, upon Brahe's return.  \"They give him a lot o' credit for dyin' in the open,\" continued the practical little wretch, with masterly handling of expletive-- \"but I want to know what else a feller like him could do, when there was no git out?  An' you'll see in Melb'n', there, a statue of him, made o' cast steel, or concrete, or somethin', standin' as bold as brass in the middle o' the street! My word! An' all the thousands o' pore beggars that's died o' thirst an' hardship in the back country--all o' them a dash sight better men nor Burke knowed how to be--where's theyre statutes? Don't talk rubbage to me.  Why, there was no end to that feller's childishness. Before he leaves Bray at Cooper's Creek, he drors out--what do you think?-- well, he drors out a plan o' forti--(adj.)--fications, like they got in ole wore-out countries; an' Bray had to keep his fellers workin' an' cursin' at this thing till the time come for them to clear.  An' mind you, this was among the tamest blackfellers in the world.  Why, Burke was dotin'. Wants a young feller, with some life in him, for to boss a expegition; an' on top o' Burke's swellishness an' uselessness, dash me if he wasn't forty!\"  \"Well, no; he war n't too old, Mosey,\" interposed Price deprecatingly. \"Wants a experienced man fer sich work.  Same time, you could n't best Burke fer a counterfit.\"  \"Sing'lar thing, you'll never hear one good word o' that man,\" observed Cooper. \"Different from all the other explorers.  Can't account for it, no road.\"  \"Another singular thing is that you'll never read a word against him,\" added Thompson.  \"In conversation, you'll always learn that Burke never did a thing worth doing or said a thing worth saying; and that his management of that expedition would have disgraced a new-chum schoolboy; and old Victorian policemen will tell you that he left the force with the name of a bully and a snob, and a man of the smallest brains.  Wonder why these things never get into print.\"  \"De mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent maxim, Thompson,\" remarked Willoughby.  \"It is that,\" retorted Mosey.  \"Divil a fear but they'll nicely bone anythin' in the shape o' credit.  Toffs is no slouches at barrickin' for theyre own push.  An' I'll tell you another dash good maximum,-- it's to keep off of weltin' a dyin' man.\"  \"Did you ever read Burke's Diary, Willoughby?\" asked Thompson. \"It's just two or three pages of the foolishest trash that any man ever lost time in writing; and I'm afraid it's about a fair sample of Burke. I wish you could talk to some fellows that I know--Barefooted Bob, for instance.  Now, there's a man that was never known to say a thing that he was n't sure of; and he's been all over the country that Burke was over, and heard all that is to be known of the expedition. And Bob's a man that goes with his eyes open.  I wish you could talk to him. Lots of information in the back country that never gets down here into civilisation .\"  \"There is a certain justice in Mosey's contention,\" I remarked, addressing Willoughby.  \"He argues that, as Burke, by dying of hardship, earned himself a statue, so Brown, Jones, and Robinson--whose souls, we trust, are in a less torrid climate than their unburied bones--should, in bare justice, have similar post-obituary recognition.  For Burke's sake, of course, the comparison in value of service had better not be entered on. Mosey would have our cities resemble ancient Athens in respect of having more public statues than living citizens.\"  \"Your allusion to Athens is singularly happy,\" replied the whaler; \"but you will remember that the Athenians were, in many respects, as exclusive as ourselves.  The impassable chasm which separates your illustrious explorer from Brown, Jones, and Robinson, existed also in Athens, though, perhaps, not so jealously guarded. But let us change the subject.\"  \"Yes; do,\" said Cooper cordially.  \"I hate argyin'.  Fust go off, it's all friendly;--'Yes, my good man.'--'No, my dear feller.'--'Don't run away with that idear.'--'You're puttin' the boot on the wrong foot.'-- 'You got the wrong pig by the tail.'--an' so on, as sweet as sugar. But by-'n'-by it's, 'To (sheol) with you for a (adj.) fool!'-- 'You're a (adj.) liar!'--'Who the (adj.  sheol) do you think you're talking to?'--an' one word fetchin' on another till it grows into a sort o' unpleasantness.\"  \"Hear anything of Bob and Bat lately?\" asked Thompson, after a pause.  \"Both gone to have a confab with Burke; an' good enough for the likes o' them,\" replied Mosey.  \"Them sort o' varmin's the curse o' the country. I ain't a very honorable sort, myself, but I'd go on one feed every two days before I'd come as low as them.  Well, couple or three year ago, you know, ole M'Gregor he sent the (adj.) skunks out with cattle to some new country, a hundred mile beyond (sheol); an' between hardship, an' bad tucker, an' bad conscience, they both pegged out.  So a feller from the Diamantinar told me a fortnit ago.\"  \"Smart fellows in their way,\" remarked Thompson.  \"I don't bear them any malice, though they rounded me up twice, and made me fork out each time.\"  \"Boolka horse-paddick?\" suggested Mosey.  \"They grabbed us there once, an' it was touch-an'-go another time.  But the place is worth a bit o' risk.\"  \"No; both times it was on Wo-Winya, on the Deniliquin side,\" replied Thompson. \"First time was about nine years ago.  Bob and Bat were dummying on the station at the time, and looking after the Skeleton paddock.  Flash young fellers they were then.  Cunningham and I worked on that paddock one night, as usual, coming up empty from the Murray.  Of course, we were out in the morning at grey daylight, but it was a bit foggy, and instead of finding the bullocks, we found Bob and Bat cantering round, looking for them. Cunningham and I separated, and so did the other two; and the four of us spent the liveliest half-hour you could wish for; chasing, and crossing, and meeting one another in all directions, and not a word spoken, and not a hoof to be seen.  At last the fog lifted a bit, and Cunningham spotted cattle in a timbered swamp, but Bat was between him and them; so he circled round gently, and was edging up to get a good start when Bat took the alarm, and saw the cattle; then it was neck-or-nothing with them for possession.  Bob and I happened to be in sight and when we saw our mates go off on the jump, we both went for the same spot. Cunningham beat Bat by a few lengths, and got possession; but when I got within a quarter of a mile, I saw there was only part of our lot there. Just then I saw Bob turn his horse, and race straight toward me; and when I looked in the direction he was going, I saw more cattle. I went for them with a clear start of a hundred yards, and would have won easy, only that I saw they were station cattle; and at the same time I caught sight of another little lot in a hollow to the left, and Bat travelling for them.  I slewed round, and gave him a gallop for it, but he won by fifty yards.  However, there was only five of our lot in the little mob.  There was thirteen wanted still; and Bob had possession of them among the station cattle.  So they got eighteen altogether, and we only got sixteen, after running the legs off our horses.\"  \"Port Phillip,\" observed Cooper pointedly.  \"Another time, going on for three years ago,\" continued Thompson, \"Bob had me as cheap as dirt for the whole twenty, while Bat snapped Potter's horses the same night.  That was on Wo-Winya again--shortly before M'Gregor sold the station to Stoddart, and just before the two of them were sent out to the Diamantina\"----  \"M'Gregor and Stoddart, of course?\" I gently suggested.  \"Yes, Tom; I thought I made that clear.\"  \"So you did, Steve.  I beg pardon.\"  \"Don't mention it, Tom.\"  True friendship lay underneath this severity, for when Thompson got started on his reminiscences, he was apt to continue indefinitely, to the ruin of his own dignity.  \"But why this solicitude and panic over being detected in trifling trespass?\" asked Willoughby.  \"Like most things in this country, it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34721"],["title","The Lighter Side of School Life (#0)"],["body","SIDE OF SCHOOL LIFE  [Illustration: LORD'S]            THE LIGHTER SIDE OF            SCHOOL LIFE             BY IAN HAY       AUTHOR OF \"A SAFETY MATCH\"      WITH ILLUSTRATIONS REPRODUCED        FROM PASTEL DRAWINGS BY            LEWIS BAUMER               BOSTON          LE ROY PHILLIPS         _First Edition published October nineteen     hundred fourteen; reprinted May     nineteen fifteen_      _Printed in Scotland by_     BALLANTYNE, HANSON, & CO.

He is invariably called \"The Doctor,\" and he wears cap and gown even when birching malefactors--which he does intermittently throughout the day--or attending a cricket match. For all we know he wears them in bed.  He speaks a language peculiar to himself--a language which at once enables you to recognise him as a Headmaster; just as you may recognise a stage Irishman from the fact that he says \"Begorrah!\", or a stage sailor from the fact that he has to take constant precautions with his trousers. Thus, the \"Doctor\" invariably addresses his cowering pupils as \"Boys!\"--a form of address which in reality only survives nowadays in places where you are invited to \"have another with me\"--and if no audience of boys is available at the moment, he addresses a single boy as if he were a whole audience. To influential parents he is servile and oleaginous, and he treats his staff with fatuous pomposity. Such a being may have existed--may exist--but we have never met him.  What of the Headmaster of Fact? To condense him into a type is one of the most difficult things in the world, for this reason. Most of us have known only one Headmaster in our lives--if we have known more we are not likely to say so, for obvious reasons--and it is difficult for Man (as distinct from Woman), to argue from the particular to the general. Moreover, the occasions upon which we have met the subject of our researches at close quarters have not been favourable to dispassionate character-study. It is difficult to form an unbiassed or impartial judgment of a man out of material supplied solely by a series of brief interviews spread over a period of years--interviews at which his contribution to the conversation has been limited to a curt request that you will bend over, and yours to a sequence of short sharp ejaculations.  However, some of us have known more than one Headmaster, and upon us devolves the solemn duty of distilling our various experiences into a single essence.  What are the characteristics of a _great_ Headmaster? Instinct at once prompts us to premise that he must be a scholar and a gentleman. A gentleman, undoubtedly, he must be; but nowadays scholarship--high classical scholarship--is a hindrance rather than a help. To supervise the instruction of modern youth a man requires something more than profound learning: he must possess _savoir faire_. If you set a great scholar--and a great scholar has an unfortunate habit of being nothing but a great scholar--in charge of the multifarious interests of a public school, you are setting a razor to cut grindstones. As well appoint an Astronomer Royal to command an Atlantic liner. He may be on terms of easy familiarity with the movements of the heavenly bodies, yet fail to understand the right way of dealing with refractory stokers.  A Headmaster is too busy a personage to keep his own scholarship tuned up to concert pitch; and if he devotes adequate time to this object--and a scholar must practise almost as diligently as a pianist or an acrobat if he is to remain in the first flight--he will have little leisure left for less intellectual but equally vital duties. Nowadays in great public schools the Head, although he probably takes the Sixth for an hour or two a day, delegates most of his work in this direction to a capable and up-to-date young man fresh from the University, and devotes his energies to such trifling details as the organisation of school routine, the supervision of the cook, the administration of justice, the diplomatic handling of the Governing Body, and the suppression of parents.  So far then we are agreed--the great advantage of dogmatising in print is that one can take the agreement of the reader for granted--that a Headmaster must be a gentleman, but not necessarily a scholar--in the very highest sense of the word. What other virtues must he possess? Well, he must be a majestic figurehead. This is not so difficult as it sounds. The dignity which doth hedge a Headmaster is so tremendous that the dullest and fussiest of the race can hardly fail to be impressive and awe-inspiring to the plastic mind of youth. More than one King Log has left a name behind him, through standing still in the limelight and keeping his mouth shut. But then he was probably lucky in his lieutenants.  Next, he must have a sense of humour. If he cannot see the entertaining side of youthful depravity, magisterial jealousy, and parental fussiness, he will undoubtedly go mad. A sense of humour, too, will prevent him from making a fool of himself, and a Headmaster must never do that. It also engenders Tact, and Tact is the essence of life to a man who has to deal every day with the ignorant, and the bigoted, and the sentimental. (These adjectives are applicable to boys, masters, and parents, and may be applied collectively or individually with equal truth.) Not that all humorous people are tactful: bitter experience of the practical joker has taught us that. But no person can be tactful who cannot see the ludicrous side of things. There is a certain Headmaster of to-day, justly celebrated as a brilliant teacher and a born organiser, who is lacking--entirely lacking--in that priceless gift of the gods, a sense of humour, with which is incorporated Tact. Shortly after he took up his present appointment, one of the most popular boys in the school, while leading the field in a cross-country race, was run over and killed by an express train which emerged from a tunnel as he ran across the line, within measurable distance of accomplishing a record for the course.  Next morning the order went forth that the whole school were to assemble in the great hall. They repaired thither, not unpleasantly thrilled. There would be a funeral oration, and boys are curiously partial to certain forms of emotionalism. They like to be harangued before a football-match, for instance, in the manner of the Greeks of old. These boys had already had a taste of the Head's quality as a speaker, and they felt that he would do their departed hero justice. They reminded one another of the moving words which the late Head had spoken when an Old Boy had fallen in battle a few years before under particularly splendid circumstances. They remembered how pleased the Old Boy's father and mother had been about it. Their comrade, whom they had revered and loved as recently as yesterday, would receive a fitting farewell too; and they would all feel the prouder of the school for the words that they were about to hear. They did not say this aloud, for the sentimentality of boys is of the inarticulate kind, but the thought was uppermost in their minds.  Presently they were all assembled, and the Head appeared upon his rostrum. There was a deathlike stillness: not a boy stirred.  Then the Head spoke.  \"Any boy,\" he announced, \"found trespassing upon the railway-line in future will be expelled. You may go.\"  They went. The organisation of that school is still a model of perfection, and its scholarship list is exceptionally high. But the school has never forgiven the Head, and never will so long as tradition and sentiment count for anything in this world.  So far, then, we have accumulated the following virtues for the Headmaster. He must be a gentleman, a picturesque figure-head, and must possess "]]]
