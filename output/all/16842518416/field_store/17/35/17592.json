In the manufacture of soaps for toilet purposes, it is usually necessary to produce as white a product as possible. In order to do this it often is necessary to bleach the tallow before saponification. The method usually employed is the Fuller's Earth process.   FULLER'S EARTH PROCESS FOR BLEACHING TALLOW.  From one to two tons of tallow are melted out into the bleaching tank. This tank is jacketed, made of iron and provided with a good agitator designed to stir up sediment or a coil provided with tangential downward opening perforations and a draw-off cock at the bottom. The coil is the far simpler arrangement, more cleanly and less likely to cause trouble. By this arrangement compressed air which is really essential in the utilization of the press (see later) is utilized for agitation. A dry steam coil in an ordinary tank may be employed in place of a jacketed tank, which lessens the cost of installation.  The tallow in the bleaching tank is heated to 180° F. (82° C.) and ten pounds of dry salt per ton of fat used added and thoroughly mixed by agitation. This addition coagulates any albumen and dehydrates the fat. The whole mass is allowed to settle over night where possible, or for at least five hours. Any brine which has separated is drawn off from the bottom and the temperature of the fat is then raised to 160° F. (71° C).  Five per cent. of the weight of the tallow operated upon, of dry Fuller's earth is now added and the whole mass agitated from twenty to thirty minutes.  The new bleached fat, containing the Fuller's earth is pumped directly to a previously heated filter press and the issuing clear oil run directly to the soap kettle.  One of the difficulties experienced in the process is the heating of the press to a temperature sufficient to prevent solidification of the fat without raising the press to too great a temperature. To overcome this the first plate is heated by wet steam. Air delivered from a blower and heated by passage through a series of coils raised to a high temperature by external application of heat (super-heated steam) is then substituted for the steam. The moisture produced by the condensation of the steam is vaporized by the hot air and carried on gradually to each succeeding plate where it again condenses and vaporizes. In this way the small quantity of water is carried through the entire press, raising its temperature to 80°-100° C. This temperature is subsequently maintained by the passage of hot air. By this method of heating the poor conductivity of hot air is overcome through the intermediary action of a liquid vapor and the latent heat of steam is utilized to obtain the initial rise in temperature. To heat a small press economically where conditions are such that a large output is not required the entire press may be encased in a small wooden house which can be heated by steam coils. The cake in the press is heated for some time after the filtration is complete to assist drainage. After such treatment the cake should contain approximately 15 per cent. fat and 25 per cent. water. The cake is now removed from the press and transferred to a small tank where it is treated with sufficient caustic soda to convert the fat content into soap.  Saturated brine is then added to salt out the soap, the Fuller's earth is allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank and the soap which solidifies after a short time is skimmed off to be used in a cheap soap where color is not important. The liquor underneath may also be run off without disturbing the sediment to be used in graining a similar cheap soap. The waste Fuller's earth contains about 0.1 to 0.3 per cent. of fat.   METHOD FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF COLOR.  A further improvement of the color of the tallow may be obtained by freeing it from a portion of its free fatty acids, either with or without previous Fuller's earth bleaching.  To carry out this process the melted fat is allowed to settle and as much water as possible taken off. The temperature is then raised to 160° F. with dry steam and enough saturated solution of soda ash added to remove 0.5 per cent. of the free fatty acids, while agitating the mass thoroughly mechanically or by air. The agitation is continued ten minutes, the whole allowed to settle for two hours and the foots drawn off. The soap thus formed entangles a large proportion of the impurities of the fat.   VEGETABLE OILS.  _Cocoanut Oil_, as the name implies, is obtained from the fruit of the cocoanut palm. This oil is a solid, white fat at ordinary temperature, having a bland taste and a characteristic odor. It is rarely adulterated and is very readily saponified. In recent years the price of this oil has increased materially because cocoanut oil is now being used extensively for edible purposes, especially in the making of oleomargarine. Present indications are that shortly very little high grade oil will be employed for soap manufacture since the demand for oleomargarine is constantly increasing and since new methods of refining the oil for this purpose are constantly being devised.  The oil is found in the market under three different grades: (1) Cochin cocoanut oil, the choicest oil comes from Cochin (Malabar). This product, being more carefully cultivated and refined than the other grades, is whiter, cleaner and contains a smaller percentage of free acid. (2) Ceylon cocoanut oil, coming chiefly from Ceylon, is usually of a yellowish tint and more acrid in odor than Cochin oil. (3) Continental cocoanut oil (Copra, Freudenberg) is obtained from the dried kernels, the copra, which are shipped to Europe in large quantities, where the oil is extracted. These dried kernels yield 60 to 70 per cent oil. This product is generally superior to the Ceylon oil and may be used as a very satisfactory substitute for Cochin oil, in soap manufacture, provided it is low in free acid and of good color. The writer has employed it satisfactorily in the whitest and finest of toilet soaps without being able to distinguish any disadvantage to the Cochin oil. Since continental oil is usually cheaper than Cochin oil, it is advisable to use it, as occasion permits.  Cocoanut oil is used extensively in toilet soap making, usually in connection with tallow. When used alone the soap made from this oil forms a lather, which comes up rapidly but which is fluffy and dries quickly. A pure tallow soap lathers very much slower but produces a more lasting lather. Thus the advantage of using cocoanut oil in soap is seen. It is further used in making a cocoanut oil soap by the cold process also for \"fake\" or filled soaps. The fatty acid content readily starts the saponification which takes place easily with a strong lye (25°-35° B.). Where large quantities of the oil are saponified care must be exercised as the soap formed suddenly rises or puffs up and may boil over. Cocoanut oil soap takes up large quantities of water, cases having been cited where a 500 per cent. yield has been obtained. This water of course dries out again upon exposure to the air. The soap is harsh to the skin, develops rancidity and darkens readily.  _Palm Kernel Oil_, which is obtained from the kernels of the palm tree of West Africa, is used in soap making to replace cocoanut oil where the lower price warrants its use. It resembles cocoanut oil in respect to saponification and in forming a very similar soap. Kernel oil is white in color, has a pleasant nutty odor when fresh, but rapidly develops free acid, which runs to a high percentage.  _Palm Oil_ is produced from the fruit of the several species of the palm tree on the western coast of Africa generally, but also in the Philippines. The fresh oil has a deep orange yellow tint not destroyed by saponification, a sweetish taste and an odor of orris root or violet which is also imparted to soap made from it. The methods by which the natives obtain the oil are crude and depend upon a fermentation, or putrefaction. Large quantities are said to be wasted because of this fact. The oil contains impurities in the form of fermentable fibre and albuminous matter, and consequently develops free fatty acid rapidly. Samples tested for free acid have been found to have hydrolized completely and one seldom obtains an oil with low acid content. Because of this high percentage of free fatty acid, the glycerine yield is small, though the neutral oil should produce approximately 12 per cent. glycerine. Some writers claim that glycerine exists in the free state in palm oil. The writer has washed large quantities of the oil and analyzed the wash water for glycerine. The results showed that the amount present did not merit its recovery. Most soap makers do not attempt to recover the glycerine from this oil, when used alone for soap manufacture.  There are several grades of palm oil in commerce, but in toilet soap making it is advisable to utilize only Lagos palm oil, which is the best grade. Where it is desired to maintain the color of the soap this oil produces, a small quantity of the lower or \"brass\" grade of palm oil may be used, as the soap made from the better grades of oil gradually bleaches and loses its orange yellow color.  Palm oil produces a crumbly soap which cannot readily be milled and is termed \"short.\" When used with tallow and cocoanut oil, or 20 to 25 per cent. cocoanut oil, it produces a very satisfactory toilet soap. In the saponification of palm oil it is not advisable to combine it with tallow in the kettle, as the two do not readily mix.  Since the finished soap has conveyed to it the orange color of the oil, the oil is bleached before saponification. Oxidation readily destroys the coloring matter, while heat and light assist materially. The methods generally employed are by the use of oxygen developed by bichromates and hydrochloric acid and the direct bleaching through the agency of the oxygen of the air.   CHROME BLEACHING"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34114"],["title","Soap-Making Manual (#3)"],["body","PALM OIL.  The chrome process of bleaching palm oil is more rapid and the oxygen thus derived being more active will bleach oils which air alone cannot. It depends upon the reaction:      Na_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 8HCl = Cr_{2}Cl_{6} + 2NaCl + 7O.  in which the oxygen is the active principle. In practice it is found necessary to use an excess of acid over that theoretically indicated.  For the best results an oil should be chosen containing under 2 per cent. impurities and a low percentage of free fatty acids. Lagos oil is best adapted to these requirements. The oil is melted by open steam from a jet introduced through the bung, the melted oil and condensed water running to the store tank through two sieves (about 1/8 inch mesh) to remove the fibrous material and gross impurities. The oil thus obtained contains fine earthy and fibrous material and vegetable albuminous matter which should be removed, as far as possible, since chemicals are wasted in their oxidation and they retard the bleaching. This is best done by boiling the oil for one hour with wet steam and 10 per cent. solution of common salt (2 per cent. dry salt on weight of oil used) in a lead-lined or wooden tank. After settling over night the brine and impurities are removed by running from a cock at the bottom of the vat and the oil is run out into the bleaching tank through an oil cock, situated about seven inches from the bottom.  The bleaching tank is a lead-lined iron tank of the approximate dimensions of 4 feet deep, 4 feet long and 3-1/2 feet wide, holding about 1-1/2 tons. The charge is one ton. A leaden outlet pipe is fixed at the bottom, to which is attached a rubber tube closed by a screw clip. A plug also is fitted into the lead outlet pipe from above. Seven inches above the lower outlet is affixed another tap through which the oil is drawn off.  The tank is further equipped with a wet steam coil and a coil arranged to allow thorough air agitation, both coils being of lead. A good arrangement is to use one coil to deliver either air or steam. These coils should extend as nearly as possible over the entire bottom of the tank and have a number of small downward perforations, so as to spread the agitation throughout the mass.  The temperature of the oil is reduced by passing in air to 110° F. and 40 pounds of fine common salt per ton added through a sieve. About one-half of the acid (40 pounds of concentrated commercial hydrochloric acid) is now poured in and this is followed by the sodium bichromate in concentrated solution, previously prepared in a small lead vat or earthen vessel by dissolving 17 pounds of bichromate in 45 pounds commercial hydrochloric acid. This solution should be added slowly and should occupy three hours, the whole mass being thoroughly agitated with air during the addition and for one hour after the last of the bleaching mixture has been introduced. The whole mixture is now allowed to settle for one hour and the exhausted chrome liquors are then run off from the lower pipe to a waste tank. About 40 gallons of water are now run into the bleached oil and the temperature raised by open steam to 150° to 160° F. The mass is then allowed to settle over night.  One such wash is sufficient to remove the spent chrome liquor completely, provided ample time is allowed for settling. A number of washings given successively with short periods of settling do not remove the chrome liquors effectually. The success of the operation depends entirely upon the completeness of settling.  The wash water is drawn off as before and the clear oil run to storage tanks or to the soap kettle through the upper oil cock.  The waste liquors are boiled with wet steam and the oil skimmed from the surface, after which the liquors are run out through an oil trap.  By following the above instructions carefully it is possible to bleach one ton of palm oil with 17 pounds of bichromate of soda and 85 pounds hydrochloric acid.  The spent liquors should be a bright green color. Should they be of a yellow or brownish shade insufficient acid has been allowed and more must be added to render the whole of the oxygen available.  If low grade oils are being treated more chrome will be necessary, the amount being best judged by conducting the operation as usual and after the addition of the bichromate, removing a sample of the oil, washing the sample and noting the color of a rapidly cooled sample.  A little practice will enable the operator to judge the correspondence between the color to be removed and the amount of bleaching mixture to be added.  To obtain success with this process the method of working given must be adhered to even in the _smallest detail_. This applies to the temperature at which each operation is carried out particularly.   AIR BLEACHING OF PALM OIL.  The method of conducting this process is identical with the chrome process to the point where the hydrochloric acid is to be added to the oil. In this method no acid or chrome is necessary, as the active bleaching agent is the oxygen of the air.  The equipment is similar to that of the former process, except that a wooden tank in which no iron is exposed will suffice to bleach the oil in. The process depends in rapidity upon the amount of air blown through the oil and its even distribution. Iron should not be present or exposed to the oil during bleaching, as it retards the process considerably.  After the impurities have been removed, as outlined under the chrome process, the temperature of the oil is raised by open steam to boiling. The steam is then shut off and air allowed to blow through the oil until it is completely bleached, the temperature being maintained above 150° F. by occasionally passing in steam. Usually a ton of oil is readily and completely bleached after the air has been passed through it for 18 to 20 hours, provided the oil is thoroughly agitated by a sufficient flow of air.  If the oil has been allowed to settle over night, it is advisable to run off the condensed water and impurities by the lower cock before agitating again the second day.  When the oil has been bleached to the desired color, which can be determined by removing a sample and cooling, the mass is allowed to settle, the water run off to a waste tank from which any oil carried along may be skimmed off and the supernatant clear oil run to the storage or soap kettle.  In bleaching by this process, while the process consumes more time and is not as efficient in bleaching the lower grade oils, the cost of bleaching is less and with a good oil success is more probable, as there is no possibility of any of the chrome liquors being present in the oil. These give the bleached oil a green tint when the chrome method is improperly conducted and they are not removed.  Instead of blowing the air through it, the heater oil may be brought into contact with the air, either by a paddle wheel arrangement, which, in constantly turning, brings the oil into contact with the air, or by pumping the heated oil into an elevated vessel, pierced with numerous fine holes from which the oil continuously flows back into the vessel from which the oil is pumped. While in these methods air, light and heat act simultaneously in the bleaching of the oil, the equipment required is too cumbersome to be practical.  Recent investigations[1] in bleaching palm oil by oxygen have shown that not only the coloring matter but the oil itself was affected. In bleaching palm oil for 30 hours with air the free fatty acid content rose and titer decreased considerably.  _Olive Oil_, which comes from the fruit of the olive trees, varies greatly in quality, according to the method by which it is obtained and according to the tree bearing the fruit. Three hundred varieties are known in Italy alone. Since the larger portion of olive oil is used for edible purposes, a lower grade, denatured oil, denatured because of the tariff, is used for soap manufacture in this country. The oil varies in color from pale green to golden yellow. The percentage of free acid in this oil varies greatly, though the oil does not turn rancid easily. It is used mainly in the manufacture of white castile soap.  Olive oil foots, which is the oil extracted by solvents after the better oil is expressed, finds its use in soap making mostly in textile soaps for washing and dyeing silks and in the production of green castile soaps.  Other oils, as poppy seed oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, rape oil, peanut (arachis) oil, are used as adulterants for olive oil, also as substitutes in the manufacture of castile soap, since they are cheaper than olive oil.  _Cottonseed Oil_ is largely used in the manufacture of floating and laundry soaps. It may be used for toilet soaps where a white color is not desired, as yellow spots appear on a finished soap in which it has been used after having been in stock a short time.  _Corn Oil and Soya Bean Oil_ are also used to a slight extent in the manufacture of toilet soaps, although the oils form a soap of very little body. Their soaps also spot yellow on aging.  Corn oil finds its greatest use in the manufacture of soap for washing automobiles. It is further employed for the manufacture of cheap liquid soaps.  _Fatty Acids_ are also used extensively in soap manufacture. While the soap manufacturer prefers to use a neutral oil or fat, since from these the by-product glycerine is obtained, circumstances arise where it is an advantage to use the free fatty acids. Red oil (oleic acid, elaine) and stearic acid are the two fatty acids most generally bought for soap making. In plants using the Twitchell process, which consists in splitting the neutral fats and oils into fatty acids and glycerine by dilute sulphuric acid and producing their final separation by the use of so-called aromatic sulphonic acids, these fatty acids consisting of a mixture of oleic, stearic, palmitic acids, etc., are used directly after having been purified by distillation, the glycerine being"]]]
