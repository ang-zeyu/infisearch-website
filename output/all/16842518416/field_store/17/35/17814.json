It is proper that the      reasons should be stated for the inference that there are no      perceptible currents, and no abrading agents at work at the      bottom of the sea upon this telegraphic plateau. I derive this      inference from a study of a physical fact, which I little      deemed, when I sought it, had any such bearings.       \"Lieutenant Berryman brought up with Brooke's deep-sea sounding      apparatus specimens of the bottom from this plateau. I sent      them to Professor Bailey, of West Point, for examination under      his microscope. This he kindly gave, and that eminent      microscopist was quite as much surprised to find, as I was to      learn, that all those specimens of deep-sea soundings are      filled with microscopic shells; to use his own words, _not a      particle of sand or gravel exists in them_. These little      shells, therefore, suggest the fact that there are no currents      at the bottom of the sea whence they came; that Brooke's lead      found them where they were deposited in their burial-place      after having lived and died on the surface, and by gradually      sinking were lodged on the bottom. Had there been currents at      the bottom, these would have swept and abraded and mingled up      with these microscopic remains the _débris_ of the bottom of      the sea, such as ooze, sand, gravel, and other matter; but not      a particle of sand or gravel was found among them. Hence the      inference that these depths of the sea are not disturbed either      by waves or currents. Consequently, a telegraphic wire once      laid there, there it would remain, as completely beyond the      reach of accident as it would be if buried in air-tight cases.      Therefore, so far as the bottom of the deep sea between      Newfoundland, or the North Cape, at the mouth of the St.      Lawrence, and Ireland, is concerned, the practicability of a      submarine telegraph across the Atlantic is proved....       \"In this view of the subject, and for the purpose of hastening      the completion of such a line, I take the liberty of suggesting      for your consideration the propriety of an offer from the      proper source, of a prize to the company through whose      telegraphic wire the first message shall be passed across the      Atlantic.       \"I have the honor to be respectfully yours.                                \"M. F. Maury,                               \"Lieutenant United States Navy.       \"Hon. J. C. Dobbin, Secretary of the Navy.\"  The reply of Professor Morse showed equal interest in the subject, in proof of which he wrote that he would come down to New York to see Mr. Field about it. A few days after he came, and saw Mr. Field at his house. This was the beginning of an acquaintance which soon ripened into friendship, and which henceforth united these gentlemen together in this great achievement. Professor Morse, in conversation, entered at length into the laws of electricity as applied to the business of telegraphing, and concluded by declaring his entire faith in the undertaking as practical; as one that might, could, and would, be achieved. Indeed, this faith he had avowed years before. In a letter written as early as August tenth, 1843, to John C. Spencer, then Secretary of the Treasury, Professor Morse had detailed the results of certain experiments made in the harbor of New York to show the power of electricity to communicate at great distances, at the close of which he says--in words that now seem prophetic:       \"The practical inference from this law is, that a telegraphic      communication on the electro-magnetic plan may with certainty      be established across the Atlantic Ocean! Startling as this may      now seem, I am confident the time will come when this project      will be realized.\"  It was the good fortune of Mr. Field--at that time and ever since--to have at hand an adviser in whose judgment he had implicit confidence. This was his eldest brother, David Dudley Field. They lived side by side on Gramercy Park, and were in daily communication. To the prudent counsels, wise judgment and unfaltering courage of the elder brother, the Atlantic Telegraph is more indebted than the world will ever know, for its first impulse and for the spirit which sustained it through long years of discouragement and disaster, when its friends were few. To this, his nearest and best counsellor, Mr. Field opened the project which had taken possession of his mind; and being strengthened by that maturer judgment, he finally resolved that, if he could get a sufficient number of capitalists to join him, he would embark in an enterprise which, beginning with the line to Newfoundland, involved in the end nothing less than an attempt to link this New World which Columbus had discovered, to that Old World which had been for ages the home of empire and of civilization. How the scheme advanced through the next twelve years, it will be our province to relate.  FOOTNOTES:  [A] Born November 30, 1819, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, the son of a Congregational minister, of whom three sons are still living: Mr. David Dudley Field, of New York; Mr. Justice Stephen J. Field, of the Supreme Court of the United States; and the writer of the present volume.  [B] From Cape Freels, Newfoundland, to Erris Head, Ireland, the distance is sixteen hundred and eleven miles; from Cape Charles, or Cape St. Lewis, Labrador, to the same point, the distance is sixteen hundred and one miles.     CHAPTER III.  THE COMPANY ORGANIZED.   And so the young New York merchant set out to carry a telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean! The design had in it at least the merit of audacity. But whether the end was to be sublime or ridiculous time alone could tell. Certain it is that when his sanguine temper and youthful blood stirred him up to take hold of such an enterprise, he little dreamed of what it would involve. He thought lightly of a few thousands risked in an uncertain venture; but never imagined that he might yet be drawn on to stake upon its success the whole fortune he had accumulated; that he was to sacrifice all the peace and quiet he had hoped to enjoy; and that for twelve years he was to be almost without a home, crossing and re-crossing the sea, urging his enterprise in Europe and America. But so it is, that the Being who designs great things for human welfare, and would accomplish them by human instruments, does not lift at once the curtain from the stern realities they are to meet, nor reveal the rugged ascents they are to climb; so that it is only when at last the heights are attained, and they look backward, that they realize through what they have passed.  But could he find anybody to join him in his bold undertaking? Starving adventurers there always are, ready to embark in any Quixotic attempt, since they have nothing to lose. But would men of sense and of character; men who had fortunes to keep, and the habit which business gives of looking calmly and suspiciously at probabilities; be found to put capital in an enterprise where, if it failed, they would find their money literally at the bottom of the sea? It seemed doubtful, but he would try. His plan was, if possible, to enlist ten capitalists, all gentlemen of wealth, who together could lift a pretty heavy load; who, if need were, could easily raise a million of dollars, to carry out any undertaking.  The first man whom he addressed was his next-door neighbor, Mr. Peter Cooper, in whom he found the indisposition which a man of large fortune--now well advanced in life--would naturally feel to embark in new enterprises. The reluctance in this case was not so much to the risking of capital, as to having his mind occupied with the care which it would impose. These objections slowly yielded to other considerations. As they talked it over, the large heart of Mr. Cooper began to see that, if it were possible to accomplish such a work, it would be a great public benefit. This consideration prevailed, and what would not have been undertaken as a private speculation, was yielded to public interest. The conference ended by a conditional agreement to engage in it, if several others did, and, as we shall see, when the Company was organized, he became its President.  The early accession of this gentleman gave strength to the new enterprise. In all the million inhabitants of the city of New York there was not a name which was better known, or more justly held in honor, than that of Peter Cooper. A native of the city, where he had passed his whole life, he had seen its growth, from the small town it was after the War of the Revolution, and had himself grown with it. Beginning with very small means and limited opportunities, he had become one of its great capitalists. Many who thus rise to wealth, in the process of accumulation, form penurious habits which cling to them, and to the end of their days it is the chief object of life to hoard and to keep. But Mr. Cooper, while acquiring the fortune, had also the heart of a prince; and used his wealth with a noble generosity. In the centre of New York stands to-day a massive building, erected at a cost of nearly a million of dollars, and consecrated \"To Science and Art.\" This was Mr. Cooper's gift to his native city. Remembering his own limited advantages of education, he desired that the young men of New York, the apprentices and mechanics, should have better opportunities than he had enjoyed. For this he endowed courses of lectures on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34765"],["title","The Story of the Atlantic Telegraph (#5)"],["body","natural sciences; he opened the largest reading-room in America, which furnishes a pleasant resort to thousands of readers daily; while to help the other sex, he added a School of Design for Women, which trains hundreds to be teachers, and some of them artists; who go forth into the world to earn an honest living, and to bless the memory of their generous benefactor. This noble institution, standing in the heart of the city, is his enduring monument.  Yet while doing so much for the public, those who saw Peter Cooper in his family knew how he retained the simple habits of early life--how, while giving hundreds of thousands to others, he cared to spend little on himself; how he remained the same modest, kindly old man; the pure, the generous, and the good. His was       \"The good gray head that all men knew,\"  and that was sadly missed when, nearly thirty years after, in 1883, at the age of ninety-two, he was borne to his grave. It is a pleasant remembrance that the beginning of this enterprise was connected with that honored name.  Mr. Field next addressed himself to Mr. Moses Taylor, a well-known capitalist of New York, engaged in extensive business reaching to different parts of the world, and whose daily observation of all sorts of enterprises, both sound and visionary, made him perhaps a severer judge of any new scheme. With this gentleman he had then no personal acquaintance, but sent a note of introduction from his brother, David Dudley Field, with a line requesting an interview, to which Mr. Taylor replied by an invitation to his house on an evening when he should be disengaged. As these two gentlemen afterwards became very intimately associated, they often recurred to their first interview. Said Mr. Field: \"I shall never forget how Mr. Taylor received me. He fixed on me his keen eye, as if he would look through me: and then, sitting down, he listened to me for nearly an hour without saying a word.\" This was rather an ominous beginning. However, his quick mind soon saw the possibilities of the enterprise, and the evening ended by an agreement--conditional, like Mr. Cooper's--to enter into it.  Mr. Taylor, being thus enlisted, brought in his friend, Mr. Marshall O. Roberts--a man whose career has been too remarkable to be passed without notice. A native of the City of New York, (though his father was a physician from Wales, who came to this country early in this century,) he found himself, when a boy of eight years, an orphan, without a friend in the world. From that time he made his way purely by his own industry and indomitable will. At the age of twenty he was embarked in business for himself, and his history soon became a succession of great enterprises. If we were to relate some of the incidents connected with his rise of fortune, they would sound more like romance than reality. He was the first to project those floating palaces which now ply the waters of the Hudson and the great lakes. He was one of the early promoters of the Erie Railroad. When the discovery of gold in California turned the tide of emigration to that coast, he started the line of steamers to the Isthmus of Panama, and controlled largely the commerce with the Pacific. Thus his hand was felt, giving impulse to many different enterprises on land and sea. His whole course was marked by a spirit of commercial daring, which men called rashness, until they saw its success, and then applauded as marvellous sagacity.  Mr. Field next wrote to Mr. Chandler White, a personal friend of many years' standing, who had retired from business, and was living a few miles below the city, near Fort Hamilton, at one of those beautiful points of view which command the whole harbor of New York. He too was very slow to yield to argument or persuasion. Why should he--when he had cast anchor in this peaceful spot--again embark in the cares of business, and, worst of all, in an enterprise the scene of which was far distant, and the results very uncertain? But enthusiasm is always magnetic, and the glowing descriptions of his persuader at length prevailed.[A]  There were now five gentlemen enlisted; and Mr. Field was about to apply to others, to make up his proposed number, when Mr. Cooper came to ask why _five_ would not do as well as _ten_? The question was no sooner asked than answered. To this all agreed, and at once fixed an evening when they should meet at Mr. Field's house to hear his statements and to examine the charter of the old company, find out what it had done, and what it proposed to do, what property it had and what debts it owed; and decide whether the enterprise offered sufficient inducements to embark in it. Accordingly they met, and for four nights in succession discussed the subject. It was in the dining-room of Mr. Field's house, and the large table was spread with maps of the route to be traversed by the line of telegraph, and with plans and estimates of the work to be done, the cost of doing it, and the return which they might hope in the end to realize for their labor and their capital. The result was an agreement on the part of all to enter on the undertaking, if the Government of Newfoundland would grant a new charter conceding more favorable terms. To secure this it was important to send at once a commission to Newfoundland. Neither Mr. Cooper, Mr. Taylor, nor Mr. Roberts could go; and it devolved on Mr. Field to make the first voyage on this business, as it did to make many voyages afterwards to Newfoundland, and still more across the Atlantic. But not wishing to take the whole responsibility, he was accompanied at his earnest request by Mr. White, and by Mr. D. D. Field, whose counsel, as he was to be the legal adviser of the Company, was all-important in the framing of the new charter that was to secure its rights. The latter thus describes this first expedition:       \"The agreement with the Electric Telegraph Company, and the      formal surrender of its charter, were signed on the tenth of      March, [1854,] and on the fourteenth we left New York,      accompanied by Mr. Gisborne. The next morning we took the      steamer at Boston for Halifax, and thence, on the night of the      eighteenth, departed in the little steamer Merlin for St.      John's, Newfoundland. Three more disagreeable days, voyagers      scarcely ever passed, than we spent in that smallest of      steamers. It seemed as if all the storms of winter had been      reserved for the first month of spring. A frost-bound coast, an      icy sea, rain, hail, snow and tempest, were the greetings of      the telegraph adventurers in their first movement toward      Europe. In the darkest night, through which no man could see      the ship's length, with snow filling the air and flying into      the eyes of the sailors, with ice in the water, and a heavy sea      rolling and moaning about us, the captain felt his way around      Cape Race with his lead, as the blind man feels his way with      his staff, but as confidently and as safely as if the sky had      been clear and the sea calm; and the light of morning dawned      upon deck and mast and spar, coated with glittering ice, but      floating securely between the mountains which form the gates of      the harbor of St. John's. In that busy and hospitable town, the      first person to whom we were introduced was Mr. Edward M.      Archibald, then Attorney-General of the Colony, and now British      Consul in New York. He entered warmly into our views, and from      that day to this, has been an efficient and consistent      supporter of the undertaking. By him we were introduced to the      Governor, (Kerr Bailey Hamilton,) who also took an earnest      interest in our plans. He convoked the Council to receive us,      and hear an explanation of our views and wishes. In a few hours      after the conference, the answer of the Governor and Council      was received, consenting to recommend to the Assembly a      guarantee of the interest of £50,000 of bonds, an immediate      grant of fifty square miles of land, a further grant to the      same extent on the completion of the telegraph across the      ocean, and a payment of £5,000 toward the construction of a      bridle-path across the island, along the line of the land      telegraph.\"  This was a hopeful beginning; and, though the charter was not yet obtained, feeling assured by this official encouragement, and the public interest in the project, that it would be granted by the colony, Mr. Field remained in St. John's but three days, when he took the Merlin back to Halifax on his way to New York, there to purchase and send down a steamer for the service of the Company, leaving his associates to secure the charter and to carry out the arrangements with the former company. To settle all these details was necessarily a work of time. First, the charter of the old Electric Telegraph Company had to be repealed, to clear the way for a new charter to the Company, which was to bear the more comprehensive title of \"New York, Newfoundland, _and London_.\" This charter--which had been drawn with the greatest care by the counsel of the Company, while on the voyage to Newfoundland--bore on its very front the declaration that the plans of the new Company were much broader than those of the old. In the former charter, the design was thus set forth:       \"The telegraph line of this company is designed to be strictly      an 'Inter-Continental Telegraph.' Its termini will be New York,      in the United States, and London, in the kingdom of Great      Britain; these points are to be connected by a line of electric      telegraph from New York to St. John's, Newfoundland, partly on      poles, partly laid in the ground, and partly through the water,      _and a line of the swiftest steamships ever built from that      point to Ireland_. The trips of these steamships, it is      expected, will not exceed five days, and as very little time      will be occupied in"]]]
