The two hauls to be counted were chosen prior to each collection from a table of random numbers. Additional selective seining was done to ascertain the habitats occupied by different species.  _Trap, Hoop, and Fyke Nets._--Limited use was made of unbaited trapping devices: wire traps 2.5 feet in diameter, six feet long, covered with one-inch-mesh chicken wire; hoop nets 1.5 feet to three feet in diameter at the first hoop with a pot-mesh of one inch; and a fyke net three feet in diameter at the first hoop, pot-mesh of one inch with wings three feet in length. All of these were set parallel to the current with the mouths downstream. The use of trapping devices was abated because data obtained were not sufficient to justify the effort expended.   _Gill Nets_  Gill-netting was done mostly in 1959 at the lower Neosho station. Use of gill nets was limited because frequent slight rises in the river caused nets to collect excessive debris, with damage to the nets.  Gill nets used were 125 feet long, six feet deep, with mesh sizes of 3/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches. Nets, weighted to sink, were placed at right angles to the current and attached at the banks with rope.   _Sodium Cyanide_  Pellets of sodium cyanide were used infrequently to collect fish from a moderately fast riffle over gravel bottom that was overgrown with willows, making seining impossible. The pellets were dissolved in a small amount of water, a seine was held in place, and the cyanide solution was introduced into the water a short distance upstream from the seine, causing incapacitated fish to drift into the seine. Most of these fish that were placed in uncontaminated water revived.   _Rotenone_  Rotenone was used in a few small pools in efforts to capture complete populations. This method was used to check the validity of other methods, and to reduce the possibility that rare species would go undetected. Rotenone was applied by hand, and applications were occasionally supplemented by placing rotenone in a container that was punctured with a small hole and suspended over the water at the head of a riffle draining into the area being poisoned. This maintained a toxic concentration in the pool for sufficient time to obtain the desired kill. Rotenone acts more slowly than cyanide, allowing more of the distressed fish to rise to the surface.   _Dyes_  Bismark Brown Y was used primarily at the upper Neosho station to stain large numbers of small fish. The dye was used at a dilution of 1:20,000. Fishes were placed in the dye-solution for three hours, then transferred to a live-box in midstream for variable periods (ten minutes to twelve hours) before release.   _Determination of Abundance_  In the accounts of species that follow, the relative terms \"abundant,\" \"common,\" and \"rare\" are used. Assignment of one of these terms to each species was based on analysis of data that are presented in Tables 9-16, (pages 402, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 411, 414-415, and 416). The number of fish caught per unit of effort with the shocker (Table 10) and with seines (Table 11) constitute the main basis for statements about the abundance of each species at all stations except the upper Neosho station. Species listed in each Table (10 and 11) are those that were taken consistently by the method specified in the caption of the table; erratically, but in large numbers at least once, by that method; and those taken by the method specified but not the other method.  For the species listed in Table 10, the following usually applies: abundant=more than three fish caught per hour; common=one to three fish caught per hour; rare=less than one fish caught per hour.  Tables 12-16 list all fish obtained at the upper Neosho station by means of the shocker, seines, and rotenone.   _Names of Fishes_  Technical names of fishes are those that seem to qualify under the International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Vernacular names are those in Special Publication No. 2 (1960) of the American Fisheries Society, with grammatical modifications required for use in the University of Kansas Publications, Museum of Natural History.     ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES   #Lepisosteus osseus# (Linnaeus)  Long-nosed Gar  The long-nosed gar was abundant at the lower and middle Neosho stations and the lower Marais des Cygnes station. Numbers increased slightly in the period of study, probably because of increased, continuous flow. The long-nosed gar was not taken at the upper Neosho station. At lower stations the fish occurred in many habitats, but most commonly in pools where gar often were seen with their snouts protruding above the water in midstream. Gar commonly lie quietly near the surface, both by day and by night, and are therefore readily collected by means of the shocker. Twice, at night, gar jumped into the boat after being shocked.  Young-of-the-year were taken at the middle and lower stations on both the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes rivers, and all were near shore in quiet water. Many young-of-the-year were seined at the lower Neosho station on 18 June 1959, near the lower end of a gravel-bar in a small backwater-area having a depth of one to three inches, a muddy bottom, and a higher temperature than the mainstream. Forty-three of these young gar averaged 2.1 inches in total length (T.L.).  Comparison of sizes of long-nosed gar taken by means of the shocker and gill nets at the lower and middle Neosho stations revealed that: the average size at each station remained constant from 1957 to 1959; the average size was greater at the lower than at the middle station; and, with the exception of young-of-the-year, no individual shorter than 13 inches was found at the middle station and only one shorter than 16 inches was taken at the lower station (Table 5).  Because collecting was intensive and several methods were used, I think that the population of gars was sampled adequately. Wallen (_Fishes of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma_, 1958:29 [mimeographed copy of dissertation, Oklahoma State University]) took large individuals in the mainstream of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma and small specimens from the headwaters of some tributaries. Because I took young-of-the-year at the lower Neosho station, it is possible that long-nosed gar move upstream when small and then slowly downstream to the larger parts of rivers as the fish increase in size. This pattern of size-segregation, according to size of river, merits further investigation.  Ripe, spent, and immature long-nosed gar (38 males and 10 females) were taken in three gill nets, set across the channel, 150 to 500 yards below a riffle, at the lower Neosho station on June 16, 17, and 18, 1959. On 23 June, 1959, 12 males and two females were taken in gill nets set 50, 150, and 400 yards above the same riffle. Operations with the shocker between 24 June and 10 July, 1959, yielded 29 males and three females. The fish were taken from many kinds of habitat in a three-mile section of the river.  Direction of movement as recorded from gill nets shows that of 67 gar taken, 45 had moved downstream and 22 upstream into the nets. Only ten of the above gar were taken from the nets set above the riffle; six of the ten were captured as they moved downstream into the nets.  On one occasion I watched minnows swimming frantically about, jumping out of the water, and crowding against the shore, presumably to avoid a long-nosed gar that swam slowly in and out of view. I have observed similar activity when gar fed in aquaria. Stomachs of a few gar from the Neosho River were examined and found to contain minnows and some channel catfish.  Long-nosed gar have a relatively long life span (Breder, 1936). This longevity and their ability to gulp air probably insure excellent survival through periods of adverse conditions. The population of long-nosed gar probably would not be drastically affected even in the event of a nearly complete failure of one or two successive hatches. Maturity is attained at approximately 20 inches, total length.  Collections at the middle Neosho station in 1958 indicate that the long-nosed gar is more susceptible to capture at night than in daytime (Table 9, p. 402).    TABLE 5.

In 1958 this species was taken at the lower station on the Marais des Cygnes and in 1958 and 1959 at the lower and middle stations on the Neosho. More common in the Neosho than the Marais des Cygnes, _L. platostomus_ occurs mainly in large streams and never was taken in the upper portions of either river. Although short-nosed gar were about equally abundant at the middle and lower stations on the Neosho, the average size was greater at the lower station (Table 6). This kind of segregation by size is shared with long-nosed gar, and was considered in the discussion of that species. Short-nosed gar were taken only in quiet water. Both species were collected most efficiently by means of gill nets and shocker. While shocking, I saw many gar only momentarily, as they appeared at the surface, and specific identification was impossible. The total "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34787"],["title","Fish Populations, Following a Drought, in the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes (#3)"],["body","all gar seen while shocking indicated that gar increased in abundance from 1957 to 1959 (see Tables 5 and 6). Judging from the gar that were identified, the increase was more pronounced in short-nosed gar than in long-nosed gar.  At the lower Neosho station in 1959, two ripe females and one spent female were taken in gill nets (16, 23 and 17 June, respectively) and were moving downstream when caught. No males were taken in the nets. Subsequently, by means of the shocker (26 June-8 July), two spent and two ripe males were captured in quiet water of the mainstream that closely resembled areas in which the gill nets were set. No females were taken by means of the shocker.    TABLE 6.

The largest population occurred at the middle station on the Marais des Cygnes in 1957. Shad were mainly in quiet water; often, when the river-level was high, I found them predominately in backwaters or in the mouths of tributary streams. Examination of nine individuals, ranging in size from seven inches to 13.5 inches T. L., indicated that maturity is reached at 10 to 11 inches T. L. Spawning probably occurred in late June in 1959 (\"ripe\" female caught on 26 June); young-of-the-year were first recorded in mid-July.   #Cycleptus elongatus# (LeSueur)  Blue Sucker  The blue sucker was taken rarely in the Neosho River and not at all in the Marais des Cygnes in my study. Cross (personal communication) obtained several blue suckers in collections made in the mainstream of the Neosho River in 1952; both young and adults occupied swift, deep riffles. The species seemingly declined in abundance during the drought, and at the conclusion of my study (1959) had not regained the level of abundance found in 1952.   #Ictiobus cyprinella# (Valenciennes)  Big-mouthed Buffalo  Big-mouthed buffalo were found in quiet water at all stations, but were rare. A ripe female, 21.5 inches long, was taken at the lower station on the Neosho on 16 June, 1959.   #Ictiobus niger# (Rafinesque)  Black Buffalo  and  #Ictiobus bubalus# (Rafinesque)  Small-mouthed Buffalo  Black buffalo were not taken at the upper station on the Neosho and were rare at other stations. Small-mouthed buffalo were taken at all stations and were common in the lower portions of the two streams. While the shocker was being used, buffalo were often seen only momentarily, thereby making specific identification impossible; both species were frequently taken together, and for this reason are discussed as a unit. Both species maintained about the same level of abundance throughout my study.  The two species were taken most often in the deeper, swifter currents of the mainstream, but were sometimes found in pools, creek-mouths and backwaters. On several occasions in the summer of 1959, buffalo were seen in shallow parts of long, rubble riffles, with the dorsal or caudal fins protruding above the surface. Ernest Craig, game protector, said buffalo on such riffles formerly provided much sport for gig-fishermen. He stated that the best catches were made at night because the fish were less \"spooky\" then than in daytime. In my collections made by use of the shocker, buffalo were taken more frequently at night (Table 9, p. 402).  On 19 June, 1959, I saw many buffalo that seemed to be feeding as they moved slowly upstream along the bottom of a riffle. The two species, often side by side, were readily distinguishable underwater. Small-mouthed buffalo appeared to be paler (slate gray) and more compressed than the darker black buffalo. To test the reliability of underwater identifications, I identified all individuals prior to collection with a gig. Correct identification was made of all fish collected on 19 June. The smallest individual obtained in this manner was 18.5 inches T. L. On 26 August, 1959, 16 small-mouthed buffalo were captured and many more were seen while the shocker was in use in the same riffle for one hour and ten minutes. One small-mouthed buffalo was caught while the shocker was being used in the pool below that riffle for one hour and fifty minutes. No black buffalo were taken on 26 August.  Spawning by buffalo was not observed but probably occurred in spring; all mature fish in my earliest collections (mid-June of each year) were spent. Small-mouthed buffalo reach maturity at approximately 14 inches T. L.   #Carpiodes carpio carpio# (Rafinesque)  River Carpsucker  River carpsucker were abundant throughout the study at all stations. Adults were taken most frequently in quiet water, but depth and bottom-type varied. The greatest concentrations occurred in mouths of creeks during times of high water; occasionally, large numbers were taken in a shallow backwater near the head of a riffle at the middle Neosho station. River carpsucker feed on the bottom but seem partly pelagic in habit. They were taken readily by means of the shocker and gill nets at all depths. The population of _C. carpio_ in the Neosho River probably was depleted by drought, although many individuals survived in the larger pools.  When stream-flow was restored, carpsucker probably moved rapidly upstream but had a scattered distribution in 1957. Trautman (1957:239) states that in the Scioto River, Ohio, river carpsucker moved upstream in May and downstream in late August and early September. Numbers found at the middle and lower Neosho stations suggest similar movements in the Neosho River in 1957. In midsummer they were common at the middle station but rare at the lower station; however, they became abundant at the lower station in November. The abundance in late fall at the lower Neosho station might have resulted either from downstream migration or from continued upstream movement into thinly populated areas. No indication of seasonal movement was found in 1958 or 1959.  River carpsucker reach maturity at approximately 11 inches T. L., and spawning occurs in May or June. A ripe male was taken from a gravel-bottomed riffle, three feet deep, at the middle station on the Neosho station on 10 June 1959.  The size-distribution of individuals taken at the middle Neosho station is presented in Fig. 2. The collection in early July of 1958 indicates that one size-group (probably the 1957 year-class) had a median length of approximately seven inches. The modal length of this group was nine inches in June, 1959. A second, predominant size-group (Fig. 2) seemed to maintain almost the same median size throughout all the collection periods, although specimens taken in the spring of 1959 were slightly smaller than those obtained in 1958. This apparent stability in size may have been due to an influx of the faster-growing individuals from a smaller size-group, coupled with mortality of most individuals more than 14 inches in length.  Young-of-the-year were taken at every station. Extensive seining along a gravel bar at the lower Neosho station indicated that the young are highly selective for quiet, shallow water with mud bottom. In these areas, young-of-the-year carpsucker were often the most abundant fish.  River carpsucker were collected more readily by use of the shocker after dark than in daylight (Table 9, p. 402).    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Length-frequency of river carpsucker   in the Neosho River, 1958 and 1959.]   #Carpiodes velifer# (Rafinesque)  High-finned Carpsucker  A specimen of _Carpiodes velifer_ taken at the lower station on the Neosho in 1958 provided the only record of the species in Kansas since 1924. Many specimens, now in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, were taken from the Neosho River system by personnel of the State Biological Survey prior to 1912. The species has declined greatly in abundance in the past 50 years.   #Moxostoma aureolum pisolabrum# Trautman  Short-headed Redhorse  The short-headed redhorse occurred at all stations. It was common at the middle and lower stations on the Neosho, rare at the upper station on the Neosho, abundant at the upper station on the Marais des Cygnes in 1957, and rare thereafter at all stations on the Marais des Cygnes. Short-headed redhorse typically occur in riffles, most commonly at the uppermost end where the water flows swiftly and is about two feet deep. An unusually large concentration was seen on 13 June, 1959, in shallow (six inches), fast water over gravel bottom at the middle station on the Neosho River.  Thirty-nine individuals were marked by clipping fins at the middle Neosho station in 1959. Four were recovered from one to 48 days later: two at the site of original capture (one 48 days after marking), one less than one-half mile downstream, and one about one mile downstream from the original site of capture.  At the middle Neosho station in 1958, this species was taken more readily by use of the shocker at night than by day (Table 9, p. 402).   #Moxostoma erythrurum# (Rafinesque)  Golden Redhorse  The golden redhorse was abundant at the upper Neosho station, rare at the middle Neosho station, and did not occur in collections at other stations. This species was taken most frequently over gravel- or rubble-bottoms in small pools below riffles, and was especially susceptible to collection by means of the shocker.  Twenty-nine golden redhorse of the 1957 year-class, taken at the upper Neosho station on 9 September 1958, were 6.2 to 8.6 inches in total length (average 7.4 inches); 26 individuals of the same year-clas"]]]
