Surf Scoter. Rare transient. Eight known specimens (three of which are now in University of Kansas collection), all taken in autumn, seven in Douglas County, one in Sedgwick County; several sight records from eastern Kansas.      No subspecies recognized.   _Oidemia nigra._ Common Scoter. Accidental. The two preserved specimens from Kansas supposedly of this species are actually Surf Scoters. L. B. Carson, however, identified an adult male Common Scoter killed by a hunter at Horton Lake, Brown County, in the early 1930's. Others have been seen by reliable field observers. Every effort should be made to secure specimens from Kansas.      Subspecies in Kansas: _O. n. americana_ Swainson, on geographical     grounds.   * _Oxyura jamaicensis._ Ruddy Duck. Common transient throughout state, rare winter resident. One breeding record: Frank Robl saw an adult female with one small young at Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County, in approximately 1929.      Subspecies in Kansas: _O. j. rubida_ (Wilson).   _Lophodytes cucullatus_ (Linnaeus). Hooded Merganser. Uncommon transient and winter resident throughout state. Probably nests occasionally (two specimens at KU taken in east in June), but no proof of this available.      No subspecies recognized.   _Mergus merganser._ American Merganser. Common transient and winter resident throughout state.      Subspecies in Kansas: _M. m. americanus_ Cassin.   _Mergus serrator._ Red-breasted Merganser. Uncommon transient throughout state; probably also rare winter resident but records lacking. This species is more common than Hooded Merganser in west, less common than Hooded in east.      Subspecies in Kansas: _M. s. serrator_ Linnaeus.   * _Cathartes aura._ Turkey Vulture. Common transient throughout state; common summer resident west at least to Clark County. Breeding distribution in west poorly known.      Subspecies in Kansas: _C. a. teter_ Friedmann.   _Coragyps atratus_ (Meyer). Black Vulture. Once occurred in southeast, but no record since 1885. Goss quotes Dr. George Lisle (\"a close observer\") as finding this species common and breeding at Chetopa, Labette County, on the Oklahoma line, prior to 1883. Lisle found a nest with two eggs in 1858. Goss also reports one killed by Watson at Ellis, Ellis County, on March 27, 1885, but the location of the specimen is unknown. The species may still occur in southeastern Kansas.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Elanoïdes forficatus._ Swallow-tailed Kite. Formerly summer resident in at least eastern half of state. Last specimen from Kansas taken by Dr. G. C. Rinker at Hamilton, Greenwood County, May 17, 1914.      Subspecies in Kansas: _E. f. forficatus_ (Linnaeus).   * _Ictinia misisippiensis_ (Wilson).

Occasional records from Douglas (nested once), Johnson, Greenwood, and Hamilton counties.      No subspecies recognized.   _Accipiter gentilis._ Goshawk. Rare and irregular winter visitor in east. Status in west unknown.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. g. atricapillus_ (Wilson).   * _Accipiter striatus._ Sharp-shinned Hawk. Transient and winter resident throughout state; less common in east. Status in summer poorly known; one nest found in Cloud County, July 11, 1938, J. M. Porter.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. s. velox_ (Wilson).   * _Accipiter cooperii_ (Bonaparte). Cooper Hawk. Resident throughout state but nesting records only from the eastern half, west to Cloud County.      No subspecies recognized.   * _Buteo jamaicensis._ Red-tailed Hawk. Abundant transient and winter resident in east; in High Plains of west, largely restricted to river bottoms in winter. Common summer resident in east; status in summer in west poorly known.      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. j. borealis_ (Gmelin) is the breeding     bird of eastern Kansas. _B. j. calurus_ Cassin probably nests in     west but no specimens available. _B. j. borealis_, _B. j.     calurus_, _B. j. kriderii_ Hoopes, and _B. j. harlani_ (Audubon),     the latter considered here as conspecific with _jamaicensis_, all     occur as transients and winter residents. More specimens needed to     establish details of distribution of various subspecies.   * _Buteo lineatus._ Red-shouldered Hawk. Uncommon transient and summer resident and irregular winter resident in eastern Kansas. Breeding records from Leavenworth and Woodson counties; doubtless breeds in other eastern counties but definite evidence lacking.      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. l. lineatus_ (Gmelin).   * _Buteo platypterus._ Broad-winged Hawk. Fairly common transient and local summer resident in eastern Kansas. Breeding records only from Douglas, Leavenworth, and Johnson counties, where species nests regularly.      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. p. platypterus_ (Vieillot).   * _Buteo swainsoni_ Bonaparte. Swainson Hawk. Abundant transient in west, fairly common in east. Nests commonly throughout western two-thirds of state and at least occasionally in eastern portion.

Subspecies in Kansas: _B. l. s. johannis_ (Gmelin).   * _Buteo regalis_ (Gray). Ferruginous Rough-leg. Common transient and winter resident in west, rare in east. Rare summer resident in west. Two nesting records: nest with four young, south fork of Smoky Hill River, near Wallace, May 27, 1883, Goss; nest with three young, west of Russell Springs, Logan County, May 29, 1954, Marvin D. Schwilling.      No subspecies recognized.   _Parabuteo unicinctus._ Harris Hawk. Accidental. Two records: male, Wichita, Sedgwick County, December 14, 1918, LeRoy Snyder; female (KU 10752), 7-1/2 miles southwest of Lawrence, Douglas County, December 25, 1918, Fred Hastie.      Subspecies in Kansas: _P. u. harrisi_ (Audubon).   * _Aquila chrysaëtos._ Golden Eagle. Formerly common resident throughout state. Now common in winter in west to rare in east. One positive nesting record: a pair nested for several years (prior to 1891) in southeastern Comanche County on a high gypsum ledge, Goss.      Subspecies in Kansas: _A. c. canadensis_ (Linnaeus).   _Haliaeetus leucocephalus._ Bald Eagle. Rare transient and winter resident in east; fairly common winter resident in west, where large numbers may gather to roost.      Subspecies in Kansas: _H. l. alascanus_ Townsend. Previous     students refer all Bald Eagles from the state to _H. l.     leucocephalus_ (Linnaeus) but specimens in the K. U. collection,     all taken in winter, are large (three females, wing, 645, 655, 680     mm.) and are clearly of the northern subspecies.   _Circus cyaneus._ Marsh Hawk. Resident, common in winter, less common and local in summer.      Subspecies in Kansas: _C. c. hudsonius_ (Linnaeus).   _Pandion haliaetus._ Osprey. Occurs irregularly throughout state but less frequently in west. Most records in spring and autumn but a few at other seasons. No definite nesting record.      Subspecies in Kansas: _P. h. carolinensis_ (Gmelin).   _Falco rusticolus._ Gyrfalcon. Accidental. One specimen: Manhattan, Riley County, December 1, 1880, A. L. Runyan (specimen at Kansas State College).      Subspecies in Kansas: _F. r. obsoletus_ Gmelin.   _Falco mexicanus_ Schlegel. Prairie Falcon. Rare summer and fairly common winter resident in west; occasional transient and winter resident in east. No satisfactory breeding records.

Watson (identified by James L. Peters).   * _Falco sparverius._ Sparrow Hawk. Common resident and transient throughout state (but status in winter in northwest not known).      Subspecies in Kansas: _F. s. sparverius_ Linnaeus.   _Bonasa umbellus._ Ruffed Grouse. Formerly common resident in eastern part; now probably extirpated in state but observers in extreme east should watch for it. One authentic specimen (KU 31944), southeastern Kansas, between 1885 and 1910, Alexander J. C. Roese. No definite nesting record.      Subspecies in Kansas: _B. u. umbellus_ (Linnaeus).   * _Tympanuchus cupido._ Greater Prairie Chicken. Resident, but highly local; absent in southwestern quarter of state.      Subspecies in Kansas: _T. c. pinnatus_ (Brewster).   * _Tympanuchus pallidicinctus_ (Ridgway). Lesser Prairie Chicken. Resident, but local, in southwestern quarter of state, north to Hamilton and Finney counties and east to Pawnee and Barber counties. A few old records east to Anderson and Neosho counties in winter.      No subspecies recognized.   _Pedioecetes phasianellus._ Sharp-tailed Grouse. Formerly resident in western part of state; scattered old records from eastern localities. Now extirpated, or nearly so, in Kansas; observers in northwestern counties should watch for it. No definite nesting record.      Subspecies in Kansas: _P. p. jamesi_ Lincoln.   * _Colinus virginianus._ Bob-white. Resident, common in east, less common and local in west.      Subspecies in Kansas: _C. v. virginianus_ (Linnaeus) in east,     intergrading through central part with _C. v. taylori_ Lincoln in     west."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34429"],["title","Check-list of the Birds of Kansas (#3)"],["body","   * _Callipepla squamata._ Scaled Quail.
