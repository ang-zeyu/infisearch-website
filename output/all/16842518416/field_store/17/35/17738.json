[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],["title","Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#1)"],["body","pattern is noticeable. The features of color pattern that are helpful in identifying the species are: 1) presence or absence of lateral dark brown stripe; 2) longitudinal extent and width of lateral stripe, if present; 3) presence or absence of a narrow white line just dorsal to the lateral dark stripe; 4) presence or absence of an interorbital dark mark; 5) the arrangement of dark markings on the back, either as longitudinal lines or series of dashes, or in the form of various kinds of transverse markings; 6) presence of dark flecks, longitudinal line, or transverse marks on shanks.  Few consistent differences in measurements and proportions exist among the species (Table 1). The most obvious morphological difference is that the head is noticeably narrower in _H. robertmertensi_ than in the other species. _Hyla phlebodes_ is the smallest species; adult males attain snout-vent lengths of only 23.6 mm. The body is slender in _H. microcephala_ and _robertmertensi_, slightly wider in _phlebodes_, and noticeably broader in _sartori_.  _Distribution._--The composite range of the Middle American frogs of the _Hyla microcephala_ group includes the lowlands of southern México and Central America, in some places to elevations of 1200 meters, southeastward from southern Jalisco and southern Veracruz, excluding arid regions (northern Yucatán Peninsula, Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, Plains of Tehuantepec, Grijalva Valley, Salamá Basin, and upper Motagua Valley) to the Pacific lowlands and the Cauca and Magdalena valleys in Colombia.   Key to Species and Subspecies   1. Lateral dark stripe, bordered above by narrow white line,      extending from snout at least to sacral region                  2     Lateral dark stripe, if present, not extending posteriorly to      sacral region and not bordered above by narrow white line       4  2. Lateral dark stripe continuous to groin; dark flecks or      longitudinal line on shanks; interorbital dark bar absent;      dorsal pattern usually consisting of pair of longitudinal dark      lines or series of dashes                                       3     Lateral dark stripe usually extending only to sacral region;      dark transverse bars on shanks; interorbital bar usually      present; dorsal pattern usually consisting of interconnecting      dark lines, sometimes forming transverse marks                                        _H. microcephala underwoodi_  3. Lateral dark stripe narrow, covering only upper edge of      tympanum; dorsal longitudinal stripes continuous, extending to      vent                              _H. microcephala microcephala_     Lateral dark stripe wide, encompassing entire tympanum; dorsal      markings consisting of longitudinal series of flecks or dashes,      or of two lines, usually not extending to vent _H. robertmertensi_  4. Lateral dark stripe indistinct, present only above tympanum and      insertion of arm; dorsal markings consisting of narrow lines      and dashes, sometimes interconnected; transverse bars on shanks      narrow relative to interspaces                     _H. phlebodes_     Lateral dark stripe absent; dorsal markings consisting of two broad      chevron-shaped marks; transverse bars on shanks wide relative to      interspaces                                          _H. sartori_     ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES   _Hyla microcephala_ Cope   _Diagnosis._--Lateral dark stripe narrow, covering only upper edge of tympanum, bordered above by narrow white stripe; dorsal pattern consisting of pair of longitudinal brown lines and no interorbital bar (eastern populations), or of irregular dark markings forming an X- or )(-shaped mark in scapular region and an interorbital bar (western populations).  _Content._--The populations inhabiting the Pacific lowlands of southeastern Costa Rica eastward to Colombia are recognized herein as _Hyla microcephala microcephala_ Cope; the populations in western Costa Rica northward to México are assigned to _Hyla microcephala underwoodi_ Boulenger.  _Distribution._--Southern Veracruz and northern Oaxaca southeastward through the Atlantic lowlands of Central America to north-central Nicaragua, thence southeastward on the Pacific lowlands to eastern Panamá, and thence into the Cauca and Magdalena valleys (Caribbean drainage) of Colombia (Fig. 1).

Bull., 39:23,       November 18, 1958.   _Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe narrow, extending from nostril along canthus, along upper edge of tympanum to groin, bordered above by narrow white line; pair of dark brown longitudinal lines on dorsum extending to vent; shanks having dark longitudinal line or flecks, no transverse bars; interorbital dark mark lacking.  _Description and Variation._--The color pattern is nearly constant. Of 103 males from the Canal Zone, all lack an interorbital dark bar, and all have a dark longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of the shank and a narrow lateral dark stripe, bordered above by a narrow white line, extending to the groin. The longitudinal dark lines on the dorsum are continuous to the groin in 95 specimens and fragmented in two specimens. In two others the lines converge and fuse in the scapular region, and in four specimens auxiliary, fragmented lines are present dorsolaterally.  In all specimens from southeastern Costa Rica (Golfito, Palmar Sur, and Villa Neilly) the pattern is constant, except that in about 10 per cent of the specimens the longitudinal line on the dorsal surface of the shank is replaced by a row of brown flecks.  Of the limited number of Colombian specimens examined, all are patterned normally, except three from Sautata, Chocó, three from Curumani, and three from Arcataca, Magdalena, which have flecks on the dorsal surfaces of the shanks, and one from Espinal, Tolima, which has no markings on the shanks.  When active at night most individuals are pale yellowish tan dorsally; the white dorsolateral line is noticeable, but the brown lateral stripe, dorsal brown lines, and lines on shanks are so pale that often they are barely discernible. By day the dorsum changes to tan or pale reddish brown; the stripes are dark brown, and the dorsolateral stripe that is white at night becomes creamy yellow (Pl. 13). Small brown flecks are present on the dorsum of most individuals. The venter always is white, and the iris is pale bronze with a brown tint immediately anterior and posterior to the pupil. In breeding males the vocal sac is pale yellow.  _Tadpoles._--Tadpoles of this species have been found in weed-choked ponds in eastern Panamá Province. The following description is based on KU 104097, a specimen in developmental stage 34 (Gosner, 1960).  Total length, 20.5 mm.; body length, 8.2 mm.; body slightly wider than deep; snout pointed; nostrils large, situated dorsally, much closer to snout than eyes, directed anteriorly; eyes moderately small, situated dorsolaterally and directed laterally; spiracle sinistral, located just posteroventral to eye; anal tube dextral. Tail xiphicercal; caudal musculature moderately deep, becoming slender posteriorly, extending beyond caudal fin; fins deepest at about one-third distance from body to tip of tail; dorsal fin extending onto body, deeper than deepest part of caudal musculature; ventral fin slightly shallower than musculature. Mouth small, terminal, lacking teeth and fringing papillae, but having finely serrate beaks. In preservative, top of head pale brown; dark stripe from tip of snout through eye to posterior edge of body, narrowing to thin line on proximal one-fourth of tail; venter white; tail creamy tan with fine black flecks most numerous posteriorly; posterior two-thirds of fins edged with black. In life, top of head yellowish tan; lateral stripe brown; belly white; anterior half of tail lacking pigment; posterior half deep orange; iris pale bronze (Pl. 15).  _Remarks._--Evidence for intergradation of _Hyla microcephala_ with _H. underwoodi_ is provided by four specimens [USC 818 (2), 6081-2] from 6.1 kilometers northeast of the mouth of the Río Tarcoles, and nine specimens [USC 8254 (2), 8255, 8256 (4), 8258 (2)] from Parrita, both in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. These localities lie about two-thirds the distance from the northwesternmost locality for _H. m. microcephala_ (Palmar Sur) to the southeasternmost locality for _H. m. underwoodi_ (Barranca). Although in most aspects of coloration the frogs are more nearly like _H. m. underwoodi_ than _H. m. microcephala_, some specimens have longitudinal lines on their shanks, such as are characteristic of _H. m. microcephala_. The dorsal pattern varies from nearly complete longitudinal lines to broken lines, fused into an X-shaped scapular mark or not.  As noted by Rivero (1961:135), _Hyla microcephala_ seems to be closely related to _Hyla misera_ Werner, a species having a wide distribution east of the Andes in South America. Despite the similarity in color pattern, size, and structure, we are reluctant to place the two taxa in the same species until data on coloration in life, mating calls, and life history are available for _Hyla misera_ and compared with those of _Hyla microcephala_.  The status of Cope's _Hyla cherrei_ is questionable. Since the type, the only specimen ever referred to the species, apparently is lost, the only extant information regarding the taxon is contained in the original description (Cope, 1894). There the species was characterized as having a narrow dorsolateral white stripe and lacking pigment on the upper arms and thighs. These characteristics of the color pattern combined with the statements \"vomerine teeth few, opposite the middle of the very large choanae\" and \"tympanic drum distinct, one half the area of eye\" serve to distinguish _H. cherrei_ from all other Costa Rican hylids, except _H. m. microcephala_ and _H. m. underwoodi_. No statements in the type description will definitely associate _cherrei_ with one or the other of these subspecies. Since it seems obvious that _H. cherrei_ can be associated with _H. microcephala_, we prefer to place the name in the synonymy of the nominate subspecies, thereby preserving the commonly used name _H. underwoodi_ (Boulenger, 1899) as a subspecies of _H. microcephala_.  _Distribution._--_Hyla microcephala microcephala_ inhabits coastal lowlands from the area of Golfo Dulce (apparently absent from the Osa Peninsula) in southeastern Costa Rica eastward in Panamá, including the Azuero Peninsula to northern Colombia and thence southward in the valleys of the Río Cauca and Río Magdalena in Colombia (Fig. 1). Except for the central area of the Canal Zone the subspecies is unknown from the Caribbean drainage in Central America, but in Colombia the subspecies occurs only in the Caribbean drainage. In Central America this frog occurs mostly on the coastal lowlands; the highest recorded elevation is 560 meters at El Valle, Coclé, Panamá. Throughout most of its range _Hyla microcephala microcephala_ occurs in disturbed habitats--cut-over forests, secondary growth, and pastureland. It does not seem to be an inhabitant of either primary forest or of _Curatella_-savanna.  _Specimens examined._--522, as follows: +Costa Rica+: Puntarenas: Golfito, KU 32172-207; 3 km.
