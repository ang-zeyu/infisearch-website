Brocchi (1877:130) stated: \"Les dernieres phalanges sont obtuses, tronqués a leur extrémité antérieure.\" Brocchi placed the species in his genus _Cauphias_ (type species, _C. guatemalensis_), which he considered to be related to _Hylodes_ ( = _Eleutherodactylus_ in the sense used by Brocchi); he thereby placed _Cauphias_ in his Hylodidae ( = Leptodactylidae, in part). This idea of relationships was perpetuated by Barbour (1927:96), who reported on the second known specimen of _Cauphias guatemalensis_ and stated: \"When I dissected the sternum I was at once struck by its similarity to Noble's figures of transitional types between arciferal and firmisternal forms. The _Cauphias_ sternum recalls some of his figures for _Sminthillus_ and _Eleutherodactylus_. This genus is probably most closely related to the latter and has probably become highly modified to meet some peculiar environmental condition or on account of some specialized habits as yet unknown.\" Kellogg (1932:118) placed _Cauphias_ in the Leptodactylidae and stated that the terminal phalanges are T-shaped. Hartweg (1941:1) considered _Plectrohyla_ to be the correct generic name for _Cauphias guatemalensis_; he thereby relegated _Cauphias_ to the synonomy of _Plectrohyla_. Hartweg (1941:9) further showed that the terminal phalanges of _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ were not T-shaped and that intercalary cartilages were present. Thus, he correctly concluded that _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ (and _P. crassa_ by implication) was a member of the family Hylidae. Stuart (1942:6) followed Hartweg's allocations and further suggested that _Plectrohyla crassa_ might be the same species as _Hyla robustofemora_ Taylor. In his description of _H. robustofemora_ Taylor (1940:392), who had not examined the type of _Cauphias crassus_, stated that were it not for the statements of Brocchi and Kellogg that _C. crassus_ has T-shaped terminal phalanges, \"I might suspect I had before me a specimen of _Cauphias_ closely related to _crassum_.\"  I have compared the type of _Cauphias crassus_ with that of _Hyla robustofemora_. With the exception of the minor differences mentioned in the preceding section on variation, the specimens are alike, leaving little doubt that they represent the same species. The statements of Brocchi and Kellogg to the contrary, the type of _Cauphias crassus_ possesses intercalary cartilages between the penultimate and terminal phalanges; the latter are not T-shaped, but as in the type of _Hyla robustofemora_, resemble those typical of _Hyla_. On the basis of the morphological characters, as pointed out for _Hyla robustofemora_ by Taylor (1940:392), _Hyla crassa_ is a member of the _Hyla bistincta_ group.  _Distribution._--This species is definitely known only from a small stream at an elevation of 2300 meters in the mountains of central Oaxaca (Fig. 4).  Specimens examined.--OAXACA: Cerro San Felipe, UIMNH 25050. \"Mexico,\" MNHN 6331.     RELATIONSHIPS   The evolutionary trend in the members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group is towards aquatic habits. _Hyla bistincta_, the least specialized species in the group, has relatively short fingers, webbing between the fingers, a truncate, high snout, and relatively large subarticular and supernumerary tubercles. _Hyla charadricola_ resembles _bistincta_ in having relatively short fingers, a slight amount of webbing, and a truncate snout. Apparently these two species are more closely related to one another than either is to the other species in the group. _Hyla robertsorum_, _pachyderma_, and _crassa_ are the most aquatic members of the group. These species are closely related, possibly conspecific. All have round, sloping snouts, robust forearms, long, unwebbed fingers, and large webbed feet. Both _H. pachyderma_ and _H. crassa_ seem to be advanced beyond _H. robertsorum_. If small nuptial spines, moderately webbed feet, and absence of a well-defined thoracic fold are considered to be less advanced than large nuptial spines and a strong thoracic fold, as in _H. pachyderma_, or fully webbed feet, as in _H. crassa_, then _H. robertsorum_ must be considered to be less advanced than _H. pachyderma_ or _H. crassa_.  Members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group inhabit mountain streams. The frogs can be found along these streams throughout the year. Since in most stream-breeding hylids there is no migration to breeding sites, the breeding call does not function to attract females to the breeding site. Apparently voices are lacking in all members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group, except in _Hyla bistincta_. The presence of vocal slits and the ability to call further indicate that _Hyla bistincta_ is the primitive member of this group.  Members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group and the species of _Plectrohyla_ closely resemble each other in osteology and body form of the adults and in structure of the tadpoles. This resemblance suggests a close relationship between the two groups. _Plectrohyla_ apparently evolved from an ancestral stock resembling the extant _Hyla bistincta_. Probably this stock gave rise independently to _Plectrohyla_ and to the _Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa_ complex. In the former the voice was retained, and a projecting prepollex spine developed, whereas in the latter the voice was lost, and the prepollex spine did not project. _Plectrohyla_ lives in mountain streams in the Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands; the _Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa_ complex inhabits similar environments in the Sierra Madre Oriental in México. _Hyla charadricola_ also lives in the Sierra Madre Oriental, whereas _Hyla bistincta_ is widespread in the mountains of México southeastward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]   [Sidenote: The biggest job in history and it had to be done with complete secrecy. It was--which was just the trouble!]   I guess I'm just a stickler, a perfectionist, but if you do a thing, I always say, you might as well do it right. Everything satisfied me about the security measures on our assignment except one--the official Army designation.  Project Hush.  I don't know who thought it up, and I certainly would never ask, but whoever it was, he should have known better. Damn it, when you want a project kept secret, you _don't_ give it a designation like that! You give it something neutral, some name like the Manhattan and Overlord they used in World War II, which won't excite anybody's curiosity.  But we were stuck with Project Hush and we had to take extra measures to ensure secrecy. A couple of times a week, everyone on the project had to report to Psycho for DD & HA--dream detailing and hypnoanalysis--instead of the usual monthly visit. Naturally, the commanding general of the heavily fortified research post to which we were attached could not ask what we were doing, under penalty of court-martial, but he had to be given further instructions to shut off his imagination like a faucet every time he heard an explosion. Some idiot in Washington was actually going to list Project Hush in the military budget by name! It took fast action, I can tell you, to have it entered under Miscellaneous \"X\" Research.  Well, we'd covered the unforgivable blunder, though not easily, and now we could get down to the real business of the project. You know, of course, about the A-bomb, H-bomb and C-bomb because information that they existed had been declassified. You don't know about the other weapons being devised--and neither did we, reasonably enough, since they weren't our business--but we had been given properly guarded notification that they were in the works. Project Hush was set up to counter the new weapons.  Our goal was not just to reach the Moon. We had done that on 24 June 1967 with an unmanned ship that carried instruments to report back data on soil, temperature, cosmic rays and so on. Unfortunately, it was put out of commission by a rock slide.  An unmanned rocket would be useless against the new weapons. We had to get to the Moon before any other country did and set up a permanent station--an armed one--and do it without anybody else knowing about it.  I guess you see now why we on (_damn_ the name!) Project Hush were so concerned about security. But we felt pretty sure, before we took off, that we had plugged every possible leak.  We had, all right. Nobody even knew we had raised ship.         *       *       *       *       *  We landed at the northern tip of Mare Nubium, just off Regiomontanus, and, after planting a flag with appropriate throat-catching ceremony, had swung into the realities of the tasks we had practiced on so many dry runs back on Earth. Major Monroe Gridley prepared the big rocket, with its tiny cubicle of living space, for the return journey to Earth which he alone would make.  Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Hawthorne painstakingly examined our provisions and portable quarters for any damage that might have been incurred in landing.  And I, Colonel Benjamin Rice, first commanding officer of Army Base No. 1 on the Moon, dragged crate after enormous crate out of the ship on my aching academic back, and piled them in the spot two hundred feet away where the plastic dome would be built.  We all finished at just about the same time, as per schedule, and went into Phase Two.  Monroe and I started work on building the dome. It was a simple pre-fab affair, but big enough to require an awful lot of assembling. Then, after it was built, we faced the real problem--getting all the complex internal machinery in place and in operating order.  Meanwhile, Tom Hawthorne took his plump self off in the single-seater rocket which, up to then, had doubled as a lifeboat.  The schedule called for him to make a rough three-hour scouting survey in an ever-widening spiral from our dome. This had been regarded as a probable waste of time, rocket fuel and manpower--but a necessary precaution. He was supposed to watch for such things as bug-eyed monsters out for a stroll on the Lunar landscape. Basically, however, Tom's survey was intended to supply extra geological and astronomical meat for the report which Monroe was to carry back to Army HQ on Earth.  Tom was back in forty minutes. His round face, inside its transparent bubble helmet, was fish-belly white. And so were ours, once he told us what he'd seen.  He had seen another dome.  \"The other side of Mare Nubium--in the Riphaen Mountains,\" he babbled excitedly. \"It's a little bigger than ours, and it's a little flatter on top. And it's not translucent, either, with splotches of different colors here and there--it's a dull, dark, heavy gray. But that's all there is to see.\"  \"No markings on the dome?\" I asked worriedly. \"No signs of anyone--or anything--around it?\"  \"Neither, Colonel.\" I noticed he was calling me by my rank for the first time since the trip started, which meant he was saying in effect, \"Man, have you got a decision to make!\"  \"Hey, Tom,\" Monroe put in. \"Couldn't be just a regularly shaped bump in the ground, could it?\"  \"I'm a geologist, Monroe. I can distinguish artificial from natural topography. Besides--\" he looked up--\"I just remembered something I left out. There's a brand-new tiny crater near the dome--the kind usually left by a rocket exhaust.\"  \"Rocket exhaust?\" I seized on that. \"_Rockets_, eh?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Tom grinned a little sympathetically. \"Spaceship exhaust, I should have said. You can't tell from the crater what kind of propulsive device these characters are using. It's not the same kind of crater our rear-jets leave, if that helps any.\"  Of course it didn't. So we went into our ship and had a council of war. And I do mean war. Both Tom and Monroe were calling me Colonel in every other sentence. I used their first names every chance I got.  Still, no one but me could reach a decision. About what to do, I mean.  \"Look,\" I said at last, \"here are the possibilities. They know we are here--either from watching us land a couple of hours ago or from observing Tom's scout-ship--or they do not know we are here. They are either humans from Earth--in which case they are in all probability enemy nationals--or they are alien creatures from another planet--in which case they may be friends, enemies or what-have-you. I think common sense and standard military procedure demand that we consider them hostile until we have evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, we proceed with extreme caution, so as not to precipitate an interplanetary war with potentially friendly Martians, or whatever they are.  \"All right. It's vitally important that Army Headquarters be informed of this immediately. But since Moon-to-Earth radio is still on the drawing boards, the only way we can get through is to send Monroe back with the ship. If we do, we run the risk of having our garrison force, Tom and me, captured while he's making the return trip. In that case, their side winds up in possession of important information concerning our personnel and equipment, while our side has only the bare knowledge that somebody or something else has a base on the Moon. So our primary need is more information.  \"Therefore, I suggest that I sit in the dome on one end of a telephone hookup with Tom, who will sit in the ship, his hand over the firing button, ready to blast off for Earth the moment he gets the order from me. Monroe will take the single-seater down to the Riphaen Mountains, landing as close to the other dome as he thinks safe. He will then proceed the rest of the way on foot, doing the best scouting job he can in a spacesuit.  \"He will not use his radio, except for agreed-upon nonsense syllables to designate landing the single-seater, coming upon the dome by foot, and warning me to tell Tom to take off. If he's captured, remembering that the first purpose of a scout is acquiring and transmitting knowledge of the enemy, he will snap his suit radio on full volume and pass on as much data as time and the enemy's reflexes permit. How does that sound to you?\"  They both nodded. As far as they were concerned, the command decision had been made. But I was sitting under two inches of sweat.  \"One question,\" Tom said. \"Why did you pick Monroe for the scout?\"  \"I was afraid you'd ask that,\" I told him. \"We're three extremely unathletic Ph.D.s who have been in the Army since we finished our schooling. There isn't too much choice. But I remembered that Monroe is half Indian--Arapahoe, isn't it, Monroe?--and I'm hoping blood will tell.\"  \"Only trouble, Colonel,\" Monroe said slowly as he rose, \"is that I'm one-_fourth_ Indian and even that.... Didn't I ever tell you that my great-grandfather was the only Arapahoe scout who was with Custer at the Little Big Horn? He'd been positive Sitting Bull was miles away. However, I'll do my best. And if I heroically don't come back, would you please persuade the Security Officer of our section to clear my name for use in the history books? Under the circumstances, I think it's the least he could do.\"  I promised to do my best, of course.         *       *       *       *       *  After he took off, I sat in the dome over the telephone connection to Tom and hated myself for picking Monroe to do the job. But I'd have hated myself just as much for picking Tom. And if anything happened and I had to tell Tom to blast off, I'd probably be sitting here in the dome all by myself after that, waiting....  \"_Broz neggle!_\" came over"]]]
