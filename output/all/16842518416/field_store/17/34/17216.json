Sunny in the morning, but clouded over by afternoon and rained heavy while out on exercise; got beautifully wet. Received the N. Y. _Tribune_ from John, mailed 18th.

Buntyn Station, Wednesday, Jan. 28. Cold and clear. Froze hard in the night. Went down to the 59th Indiana where there was a gallery. Took my likeness for $1.00.

[Sidenote: 1863 Sunday in Camp]  Buntyn Station, Sunday, Feb. 1. It is Sunday, but hard to realize it. The same routine is gone through as upon the other days, the cards shuffled with equal liveliness, the game of ball with the same noise. And I lay in my tent never realizing that this is the Sunday that I used to spend at home with such stillness, when the horses stayed in the stable unhitched, all work laid aside. Ah, well I remember the first Sunday spent in the army, how I used to recoil as I heard the boisterous oaths and reckless sport of the soldiers as they were returning to their comrades on that clear Sunday morning from Columbus to Corinth. It was just five months ago to-day, and am I really so much changed? Can it be that I am so much more vicious and wicked than then, that I heed not the Sabbath? God forbid. But what does company have to do? Almost everything. I flatter myself that it is not so very wicked. It cannot be.  In the evening I went to Griffith's \"shebang\" and listened to sacred music. It sounded as of old. \"I'm a Pilgrim\", \"There is a Happy Land\" etc. But a soldier is a soldier, and the \"Dixie\" and \"Gay and Happy\" were promiscuously mixed. Weather warm and sunny. Heard that the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry were at Memphis.   Buntyn Station, Monday, Feb. 2. Cold, and toward the evening windy. S. Beaver went down town in search of his brother wounded at Arkansas Post, but returned without finding him. Gone up the river.   Buntyn Station, Tuesday, Feb. 3. Very cold for this latitude, having frozen water one-quarter of an inch in thickness. Detailed to go with the teams down town. Got there by 10 A. M. Loaded four teams with hay, having to take it out of a barge. Heavy work. After they were loaded, Griffith and myself went around to do a little business. Meantime, the teams started, thus obliging us to walk home. Came into camp by 6 P. M. The 93rd Indiana Volunteers came to the station by rail and pitched their tents alongside of the 48th.   Buntyn Station, Wednesday, Feb. 4. Cold and clear as a bell. Exercised our horses for two hours under Sergeant Runyan. A. Goodman with two others of the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry made us a visit, they being encamped within the limits of the town. Turned warm in the afternoon, and turned into snow which fell heavy till dark.   Buntyn Station, Thursday, Feb. 5. About three inches of snow. Quite cold all day. E. W. E. went to town; was called on to guard S. Sanger for discharging a revolver. Very cold.   Buntyn Station, Friday, Feb. 6. Temperature what they would call quite sharp, but indicative of a fine day. Most of the snow disappeared during the day. Health excellent. Spelling school in the evening at G. Thomas's shanty.   Buntyn Station, Saturday, Feb. 7. Quite cold in the morning. The frosty air rather keen in our well ventilated house, but a brisk fire soon made us comfortable. 4th Minnesota Infantry and the 12th Wisconsin Battery passed by toward Memphis. We are to go in the morning.   Memphis, Sunday, Feb. 8. Warm and cloudy day. Reveille at one hour before daylight. Prepared to march, and started at 7 A. M., the 48th going on the railroad, and we took the south road. The roads were very muddy, the frequent frosts had made them soft, and we had very hard work to get along with the balky horses that we had. Came into camp at 12 M. about a mile southeast of town on a hill covered with trees, very handsome. Busy in building racks and \"shebangs\". All the lumber under guard.   Memphis, Monday, Feb. 9. Hitched up the team and got a load of bricks and boards from a burned building one and one-quarter miles from camp. Weather very sultry, warm, indications of rain. Signed the pay roll for September and October.   Memphis, Tuesday, Feb. 10. A fine spring rain fell nearly all day, nevertheless we covered our shanty and built our chimney.   Memphis, Wednesday, Feb. 11. Warm and sunny. Ball playing and building shanties the order of the day. We completed ours. It consists of an excavation of one foot, then walled two feet with rails and logs, and banked; covered with a double roof, a brick chimney in one end, and door in the other, with the floor boarded. Such is our house.   Memphis, Thursday, Feb. 12. Slept in a wet bed, our door being open, a storm coming up of rain, wind and thunder. Health worse than it has been for two months. Diarrhea and pain in bowels.   Memphis, Friday, Feb. 13. A bright, sunny day. Everything looked cheerful. Standing gun drill. Milton Campbell, 23rd Regiment, made us a visit from the hospital. Health better.   Memphis, Saturday, Feb. 14. Six months in the service. Another rainy day. Signed the pay rolls again, the first ones being objectionable and returned.   Memphis, Sunday, Feb. 15. Warm and pleasant. Health good. Two horses and three mules stolen last night. Guards doubled.   Memphis, Monday, Feb. 16. Was called on guard last night, second relief. While on the last relief, the sounds of the drum and bugle were heard upon all sides. A foraging expedition to be sent out, one section of the 12th Wisconsin to accompany, but when the bugle sounded most of the men refused to fall in, as there were some sixty of the recruits of last August, these having been by neglect not mustered in the U. S. service, hence a remonstrance was sent to General Quinby. Meantime the men refused to do duty.  [Sidenote: 1863 Sight Seeing]  After watering horses, G. Thomas, E. W. Evans and myself visited the Elmwood cemetery half a mile distant. It contains forty acres and is certainly a beautiful \"City of the Dead\", handsomely divided off by evergreen shrubbery, with the spacious vaults of solid marble. From the white obelisk to the little lambs at the heads of once sparkling innocent babes, all was beautiful. But on one side were four hands busily piling up the rounded graves in close compact. They held the bodies of the unfortunate soldiers, averaging twelve a day. On the other side were the like victims of the Confederate States of America.   Memphis, Tuesday, Feb. 17. Wet and cloudy. A dismal and dreary day for me. Kept inside nearly all day. Burnt up all my letters which by this time had accumulated, so as to encroach too much on the room of my crowded valise. It was a difficult task. They seemed to be a connecting link between me and the dear ones. I read the anxious words over, and then with a sigh consigned them to the flames. Burnt up 17 of T. L.'s, 18 of J. L.'s, 11 of M. L.'s and 15 from Albion.   Memphis, Wednesday, Feb. 18. Raw and windy. Health not very good.   Memphis, Thursday, Feb. 19. Warm and dry, though windy. Suffering with a very bad cold. Captain Dillon read an order from J. B. McPherson, commanding 17th Army Corps, relative to going to Vicksburg. Patriotism raised the spirit of the boys fifty per cent. Played ball in the afternoon.   Memphis, Friday, Feb. 20. Health better but very sore throat. Beautiful day.   Memphis, Saturday, Feb. 21. Rain and thunder all day. Health not very good. Sore throat.   Memphis, Sunday, Feb. 22. Cold. Froze the mud in the morning. Excused from duty, being on the sick list. Cold.   Memphis, Monday, Feb. 23. Very pleasant. Health little better. The long looked for \"to-morrow\" at last arrived and the paymaster paid us off. Rec'd $13.80. $20.00 sent per allotment, being up to Oct. 31, 1862.   Memphis, Tuesday, Feb. 24. Very pleasant spring day. Boys busy settling their accounts. Captain H. Dillon started home on a furlough. Lieutenant Simpson also went with a discharge.   Memphis, Wednesday, Feb. 25. Rained in torrents all last night and to-day, with thunder and lightning. Health better. No mail from above since Saturday.   Memphis, Thursday, Feb. 26. Cleared off a little but drizzled part of the day. Received a needle case from home, a loving tribute from sister Mary. No mail down the river.   Memphis, Friday, Feb. 27. Pleasant day. Oiled our harness in the afternoon. Troubled with diarrhea severely. Rec'd a letter from home, they being in great anxiety about me, as my letters did not arrive at their destination. Poor mother. I have thought much of you since reading it, and may I spare no pains keeping you easy, is my prayer.   Memphis, Saturday, Feb. 28. The last of February, consequently mustered for pay at 9 A. M. by Lieutenant S. F. Clark. Then opened ranks and inspected by Lieutenants Clark, Hood and Simpson, the latter being reinstated. Ordered to prepare for an inspection to-morrow.     UP AND DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI AND YAZOO   [Sidenote: 1863 Embarking on the Transports]  Memphis, Sunday, March 1. To-day we were ordered to prepare for an inspection by Major Maurice, chief of artillery, but instead of that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33211"],["title","An Artilleryman's Diary (#8)"],["body","marching. We broke up camp at 9 A. M. and marched with the whole of Quinby's Division into Memphis. There was a busy scene. Infantry and artillery and baggage and wagons, all in a rush embarking on the transports. 6th and 12th Wisconsin Batteries were ordered on the \"Robert Campbell Jr.\" but we could not get out on first Section, it being too crowded. The 2nd and 3rd Sections with the battery and forage wagons were pushed in front of the \"Tecumseh\" and there guarded for the night.   Memphis, Monday, March 2. Cloudy in the morning but cleared off sunny. Failed to get the carriages on in the forenoon. After dinner four men of each platoon were left to load the pieces, while the boat dropped down to load with coal. Felt rather weak; troubled with diarrhea which had rendered me rather weak. Got forage on board for horses.   On the Mississippi, Tuesday, March 3. Raw and cold on the boat. Laid at the wharf all the forenoon, waiting for the word. 2 P. M. the fleet \"tied loose\" and headed down stream, the \"Campbell\" being fourth in the procession. It was an interesting spectacle, fourteen boats all laden with troops and munition and ammunition of war, leaving the clayey bluffs of Memphis on one side, and the blackened ruins of Hopefield on the other to plan the final destruction of all that harbor the enemies of our country. But notwithstanding, it was a sad thought to me as I looked to the distant North, where there are anxious hearts for me, and I was still going farther, and I may never again return. The river was very high, nothing but water in sight, the willows putting on their garb of green. The \"Campbell\" soon took the lead and arrived at Helena by 9 P. M. ninety miles distant. Tied up till 2:30 A. M.   [Sidenote: 1863 Racing on the Mississippi]  Grand Lake Landing, Ark., Wednesday, March 4. When we again started, the air was very raw and cold. Hailed at the mouth of White River by a gunboat and we had to come to and report at 9 A. M. Passed Napoleon at 11 A. M. which was nearly inundated. In the afternoon a race took place between the \"Campbell\" and the \"Louisiana\" which came up, and after about half an hour took the lead. 5 P. M. the fleet landed at Grand Lake Landing, eighteen miles above Providence. We immediately commenced unloading; got everything off except the horses. They were harnessed, but were again unharnessed. Slept on the boat.   Grand Lake Landing, Thursday, March 5. Up early; got the horses; then got the carriages off the \"Tecumseh\" which was rather tough work. Came into park right by the levee and stretched our picket rope and put up the tarpaulin. Very wet all around. On guard. Health very good.   Grand Lake Landing, Friday, March 6. Cloudy and windy. General Quinby went down on the \"Superior\" to Providence, returned in the evening. In the afternoon David Evans and myself went down stream on the levee, bareback about three miles, where the engineers were at work digging out the levee. Took a drink in Louisiana and returned to camp with no better impression of the sunny South.   On the Mississippi, Saturday, March 7. Ordered to reembark at early dawn. Arose at 4 o'clock but did not get loaded till in the afternoon on the same boats as before. Severe rainstorm and wind last night. Very muddy. Part of the day the sun shone very bright. Health good. 2:30 P. M. the fleet once more \"swung loose\" and headed up stream. The \"Campbell\" was aground, so had to be towed out by the \"Gladiator\" and \"John H. Dickey\"; after she got afloat we lashed to the former to get some coal. As night advanced we kept slowly going, and by night were the fourth in line.   On the Mississippi, Sunday, March 8. The boat had been steadily plowing her way up the turbid water of the Mississippi. Rained very heavy, got a wet bed to sleep on. Very foggy all day; passed the \"Von Phal\", being next to the flagship \"Superior\". Passed the Yazoo Pass, 2. P. M.  4 P. M.--We have landed on the Arkansas side three miles below Helena, where the troops were ordered ashore to cook and for recreation. The flag ship went up to Helena, and returned with a good quantity of mail.   On the Mississippi, Monday, March 9. Went up to Helena after coal, took on board 400 boxes; while there the boys were busy in buying a supply of soft bread and other rarities. Many of the boys found acquaintances in the 29th Wisconsin Infantry and the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry which were encamped. General Quinby went down on the \"Pocahontas\" in the afternoon to Yazoo Pass.   On the Mississippi, Tuesday, March 10. Arose with but poor rest, it having rained all night, and lying on deck with the tarpaulin but poorly arranged. Got very wet. Rained steadily all day. Amused myself best I could reading what I could in the crowded cabin filled with the tobacco fumes, and boisterous with card players. 4 P. M. mail arrived. Rec'd a letter from J. L. and T. L. and three papers. All well. Brother James lame by accident, poor fellow, but thanks to kind Providence, he is under the nursing of a devoted mother and tender sisters. Priceless boon.   Near Helena, Ark., Wednesday, March 11. Sunny and fine weather. Instead of moving came the order to disembark, and by noon the whole of Quinby's Division was on the sand bar of about two acres in one solid mass. It was with difficulty that we got our battery in position and tarpaulin put up.   Near Helena, Thursday, March 12. Fine weather. Washed my clothes in the forenoon. In the afternoon joined in the funeral procession of a member of Co. G., 72nd Illinois. Laid him in the swamp and left him in the cheerless spot, a soldier's grave. Many of the boys in spite of high water, went out foraging and brought in fresh pork and beef in plenty.   Near Helena, Friday, March 13. Health good. Fine weather. Drew thirty days' forage for horses, per order. 1st Brigade embarking, loading in the night. Stood guard.   Near Helena, Saturday, March 14. Health not very good. Seven months ago I enlisted in the service of the U. S. Then I hoped that by this time a different phase of the matter could be seen. But alas, it very dark ahead, yet I do not despond, neither have I regretted my enlistment. I can only do the best I can, and be satisfied. A hard tug is before me. May God grant me health and courage to do my duty.   Near Helena, Sunday, March 15. Warm day. Ross's 8th Division landed a little below from Memphis. 1st Brigade and 2nd Battery left for the Pass yesterday. Received papers of the 13th--_Bulletin_ [Memphis].   Near Helena, Monday, March 16. A fine spring day. Still troubled with diarrhea. All monotonous in camp. Spent most of the day patching. Vaccinated by George Fisher, hospital steward.   Near Helena, Tuesday, March 17. Very warm, a forerunner of the burning heat to come. Mail arrived. Heard from home. Oh! welcome letters.   Near Helena, Wednesday, March 18. Very warm. Felt a little better. Nothing very interesting.   Near Helena, Thursday, March 19. Exercised and washed my horses. Health in camp poor. Eighteen on the sick list.   Near Helena, Friday, March 20. The marine fleet of Colonel Ellet passed down the river, consisting of the \"Autocrat\", \"Diana\", \"Baltic\", \"Alone\", and the \"E. H. Fairchild\" with iron-clad ram. Boats gathering; expecting to embark soon. 11th Wisconsin Infantry landed below here.   [Sidenote: 1863 Atlantic Monthly in Camp]  Near Helena, Saturday, March 21. Sergeant Hauxhurst, C. Campbell and Shockley sent North to the hospital. Capt. H. Dillon arrived in the evening, bringing many presents to the boys. I received a pair of stockings knit by my dear mother, and the _Atlantic Monthly_ of June 2. Rec'd mail in the night.   Near Helena, Sunday, March 22. Cloudy and indications of rain. Infantry embarked. Ordered to be ready to go on at 12 M. but the boats did not come. Drizzled rain nearly all day. Health none the best. Diarrhea very bad. Water rising very fast.   On Moon Lake, Monday, March 23. Reveille at 4 A. M. At dawn we commenced embarking, the left Section under Lieutenant Hood on the \"Armada,\" center Section under Simpson on the \"Jesse K. Bell.\" First piece on the \"White Rose.\" Second piece on the \"Rose Hamilton.\" Rained heavy all day. 2 P. M. we swung off, I being on the \"Jesse Bell.\" Laid off till 4 P. M. when we entered the Pass, the fourth boat of the fleet. At the mouth it was about five rods wide. The water shot through at a wild rate. The wheel was reversed to check the speed of the boat. On we went, through the woods and short turns until we reached Moon Lake, where it widened. The Lake is about three miles long, half a mile wide, where we had smooth sailing until dark, when we tied up near an old negro hut. On the north side a squad of cavalry encamped close by. A member of the 93rd Illinois (which is on board with us) was buried near the shore. Made our bed under the wheels of the pieces, the boat being so crowded; had but poor rest. Slept as close as \"three in the bed and two in the middle.\"   On Yazoo Pass, Tuesday, March 24. Started at 7 A. M. and kept moving slowly all day from one tree to the other, backing up nearly as often as going ahead, often being obliged to tie in order to give room for those ahead. A limb broke down our left smokestack close to the hurricane decking notwithstanding they were cut off nearly to the half before starting. Jack-staff broke twice. All the light-work of the pilot house brushed off.  5 P. M. passed the foundered boat \"Jenny Lind\" sunk over the first deck. She ran on shore and all the goods saved. There were a few soldiers belonging to the 43rd Indiana with her.  6 P. M. ran afoul, so that we were obliged to tie up for the night in sight of another wreck a few rods ahead. People may read of this Pass in time to come, but they will never know what it is until they see it.   On Yazoo Pass, Wednesday, March 25. Awakened by the bell which indicated that we were about to start. Curiosity soon found me on deck after a good night's sleep. A beautiful morning. The \"Steam"]]]
