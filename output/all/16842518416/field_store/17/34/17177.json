Table of Occurrence.   In this table the birds are arranged according to the order of their comparative frequency or rarity, based upon personal observations in _Lincoln Park_. The abundance of the birds--that is, the number of individual birds of different species--is in no wise shown, but simply the relative representation of each species. For instance, out of a total of 454 mornings, covering observations during six years, the _Robin_ was seen on 383 different mornings.  The record for 1902, during the absence of the authors, is that of Mr. H. V. Bozell.

Note.--The following table gives the dates of the first arrival of each bird mentioned in the preceding list of one hundred and fourteen for the seven years from 1897 to 1903 inclusive, _as observed in Lincoln Park_. The birds are arranged in their respective families, and space is left for recording their first appearance in any succeeding year.  The record for 1902, in the absence of the authors, was kept by Mr. Harold V. Bozell.  Attention is called to the fact that many birds which are common summer residents in the neighboring country are rare migrants in the Park. Among these may be mentioned the _Red-winged Blackbird_, _Bobolink_ _and_ _Warbling Vireo_. Some fine singers also, for example, the _Vesper Sparrow_, _Yellow-throated Vireo_ and _Hermit Thrush_, are usually silent in the Park.                                    |1897 1898 1899 1900 1901
