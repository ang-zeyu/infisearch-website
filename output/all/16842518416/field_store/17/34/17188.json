(#8)"],["body","d, in looking back upon our journey among ruined cities, no subject of greater interest presents itself to my mind. The mound is forty-five feet high. The steps had fallen; trees were growing out of the place where they stood, and we reached the top by clinging to the branches; when these were cleared away, it was extremely difficult to ascend and descend. The maguey plants cut down in making the clearing appear fallen on the steps.  A narrow platform forms the top of the mound. The building faces the south, and when entire measured forty-three feet in front and twenty feet in depth. It had three doorways, of which one, with eight feet of the whole structure, has fallen, and is now in ruins. The centre doorway opens into two chambers, each twenty feet long and six feet wide.  Above the cornice of the building rises a gigantic perpendicular wall to the height of thirty feet, once ornamented from top to bottom, and from one side to the other, with colossal figures and other designs in stucco, now broken and in fragments, but still presenting a curious and extraordinary appearance, such as the art of no other people ever produced. Along the top, standing out on the wall, was a row of death's heads; underneath were two lines of human figures in alto relievo (of which scattered arms and legs alone remain), the grouping of which, so far as it could be made out, showed considerable proficiency in that most difficult department of the art of design. Over the centre doorway, constituting the principal ornament of the wall, was a colossal figure seated, of which only a large tippet and girdle, and some other detached portions, have been preserved. Conspicuous over the head of this principal figure is a large ball, with a human figure standing up beside it, touching it with his hands, and another below it with one knee on the ground, and one hand thrown up as if in the effort to support the ball, or in the apprehension of its falling upon him. In all our labours in that country we never studied so diligently to make out from the fragments the combinations and significance of these figures and ornaments. Standing in the same position, and looking at them all together, we could not agree.  Mr. Catherwood made two drawings at different hours and under a different position of the sun, and Dr. Cabot and myself worked upon it the whole day with the Daguerreotype. With the full blaze of a vertical sun upon it, the white stone glared with an intensity dazzling and painful to the eyes, and almost realizing the account by Bernal Dias in the expedition to Mexico, of the arrival of the Spaniards at Cempoal. \"Our advanced guard having gone to the great square, the buildings of which had been lately whitewashed and plastered, in which art these people are very expert, one of our horsemen was so struck with the splendour of their appearance in the sun, that he came back at full speed to Cortez, to tell him that the walls of the houses were of silver.\"  Our best view was obtained in the afternoon, when the edifice was in shade, but so broken and confused were the ornaments that a distinct representation could not be made even with the Daguerreotype, and the only way to make out all the details was near approach by means of a ladder; we had all the woods to make one of, but it was difficult for the Indians to make one of the length required; and when made it would have been too heavy and cumbersome to manage on the narrow platform in front. Besides, the wall was tottering and ready to fall. One portion was already gone in a perpendicular line from top to bottom, and the reader will see in the engraving that on a line with the right of the centre doorway the wall is cracked, and above is gaping, and stands apart more than a foot all the way to the top. In a few years it must fall. Its doom is sealed. Human power cannot save it; but in its ruins it gave a grand idea of the scenes of barbaric magnificence which this country must have presented when all her cities were entire. The figures and ornaments on this wall were painted; the remains of bright colours are still visible, defying the action of the elements. If a solitary traveller from the Old World could by some strange accident have visited this aboriginal city when it was yet perfect, his account would have seemed more fanciful than any in Eastern story, and been considered a subject for the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.  [Engraving 11: Arched Gateway]  At the distance of a few hundred feet from this structure, in sight at the same time as we approached it, is an arched gateway, remarkable for its beauty of proportions and grace of ornament The plate opposite represents this gateway. On the right, running off at an angle of thirty degrees, is a long building much fallen, which could not be comprehended in the view. On the left it forms an angle with another building, and on the return of the wall there is a doorway, not shown in the engraving, of good proportions, and more richly ornamented than any other portion of the structure. The effect of the whole combination was curious and striking, and, familiar as we were with ruins, the first view, with the great wall towering in front, created an impression that is not easily described.  [Engraving 12: Interior Front of Gateway]  The gateway is ten feet wide, passing through which we entered a thick forest, growing so close upon the building that we were unable to make out even its shape; but, on clearing away the trees, we discovered that this had been the principal front, and that these trees were growing in what had once been the area, or courtyard. The doors of the apartments on both sides of the gateway, each twelve feet by eight, opened upon this area. Over each doorway was a square recess, in which were the remains of a rich ornament in stucco, with marks of paint still visible, apparently intended to represent the face of the sun surrounded by its rays, probably once objects of adoration and worship, but now wilfully destroyed. The plate opposite represents this front The buildings around the area formed a great irregular pile, measuring in all two hundred feet in length. The plan was different from that of any we had seen, but, having so many subjects to present, I have not had it engraved.  Northeast from the mound on which the great wall stands, and about one hundred and fifty yards distant, is a large building, erected on a terrace, and hidden among the trees growing thereupon, with its front much ruined, and having but few remains of sculptured ornaments. Still farther in the same direction, going through the woods, we reach the grand, and, without extravagance, the really magnificent building represented in the frontispiece to this volume. It stands on a gigantic terrace, four hundred feet long and one hundred and fifty feet deep. The whole terrace is covered with buildings. The front represented measures two hundred and eighty-two feet in length. It consisted of three distinct parts, differing in style, and perhaps erected at different times. At a distance, as seen indistinctly through the trees, we had no idea of its extent. We came upon it at the corner which appears on the right in the engraving. Our guide cut a path along the front wall, and stopping, as we did, to look at the ornaments, and entering the apartments as we went along, the building seemed immense.  [Engraving 13: Portion of a Façade]  The whole long façade was ornamented with sculptured stone, of which, large as the engraving is, the details cannot appear; but, to give some idea of their character, a detached portion is represented up the engraving opposite, and, I ought at the same time to remark, is perhaps the most curious and interesting of any. It is at the left end of the principal building, and in the angle of the corner are the huge open jaws of an alligator, or some other hideous animal, enclosing a human head.  The reader will form some idea of the overgrown and shrouded condition of this building from the fact that I had been at work nearly the whole day upon the terrace, without knowing that there was another building on the top. In order to take in the whole front at one view, it was necessary to carry the clearing back some distance into the plain, and in doing this I discovered the upper structure. The growth of trees before it was almost equal to that on the terrace, or in any part of the forest. The whole had to be cleared, the trees thrown down upon the terrace, and thence dragged away to the plain. This building consists of single narrow corridors, and the façade is of plain stone, without any ornaments.  The platform in front is the roof of the building underneath, and in this platform was a circular hole, like those we had seen at Uxmal and other places, leading to subterraneous chambers. This hole was well known to the Indians, and had a marvellous reputation; and yet they never mentioned it until I climbed up to examine the upper building. They said it was the abode of el dueño de la casa, or the owner of the building. I immediately proposed to descend, but the old Indian begged me not to do so, and said apprehensively to the others, \"Who knows but that he will meet with the owner!\" I immediately sent for rope, lantern, and matches; and, absurd as it may seem, as I looked upon the wild figures of the Indians standing round the hole, and their earnest faces, it was really exciting to hear them talk of the owner. As there was a difficulty in procuring rope, I had a sapling cut and let down the hole, by means of which I descended with a lantern. The news of my intention and of the preparations going on had spread among the Indians, and all left off work and hurried to the spot. The hole was about four feet deep, and, just as my head sunk below the surface, I was startled by an extraordinary scratching and scampering, and a huge iguana ran along the wall, and escaped through the orifice by which I had entered.

CHAPIN.    BULLETIN OF THE   AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,   VOL. XXXIV, ART. XVI, pp. 509-513    _New York, October 20, 1915._     =Article XVI.=--DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW BIRDS FROM THE BELGIAN CONGO.  BY JAMES P. CHAPIN.   The whole of the large collection of birds secured by the Congo Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History during the years 1909 to 1915, under the leadership of Mr. Herbert Lang, has now arrived safely at the Museum. It is composed of material gathered all across the Belgian Congo, from Boma on the west to Aba in the northeastern corner, but the greater part from the more remote territory between Stanley Falls and the Enclave of Lado, including the dense equatorial forests of the Ituri, Nepoko, and Bomokandi, and the high-grass and bush country of the Uele District to the north and northeast.  Of the relatively small number of zoölogical expeditions that have passed through and collected in these regions, none has ever before been able to make such a prolonged stay, and the varied zoölogical results of this Expedition are surely of the highest scientific interest. The ornithological collection contains in the neighborhood of six thousand skins, and represents some 600 different species, a number of them of course new to science. These it is our purpose to describe as promptly as possible in this Bulletin, before taking up the greater work of a general report on all the forms collected, with more extended notes on their distribution, habits, food, and nests.  Descriptions of the first three new forms follow:   =Chætura melanopygia= sp. nov.       Related to _C. stictilæma_, but much larger, with feathers of      upper breast more heavily margined with blackish, and without any      trace of a light rump-band.       Description of type, collector's No. 4986 Congo Exp. A. M. N. H.,      [Male] ad. Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo, Aug. 15, 1913.       Upper parts brownish-black (chætura-black, Ridgw.) becoming black      on wings and tail, with faint violet and green reflections (green      on freshly molted feathers). Ear coverts drab, bordered with      fuscous-black; feathers of throat pale smoke-gray, margined with      fuscous, those of upper breast similar, but heavily bordered with      fuscous-black, consequently with a very pronounced \"scaly\"      appearance; lower breast growing darker, so that the dark borders      are less conspicuous, and the feathering of the belly completely      fuscous-black with slight oily gloss. Under wing coverts      mouse-gray with darker edges, flanks and under tail-coverts black      with slight greenish gloss. Tail slightly rounded.       Iris dark brown, bill black, feet bluish, shading to dusky brown      on tips of toes and claws. Sexual organs enlarged.       Length (skin) 145 mm.; wing 164; tail 49.5; bill (exposed      culmen), 7.5; metatarsus 13.  Only one specimen secured, out of two or three of these swifts that were flying about over the Ituri River, in company with several examples of _Chætura cassini_. In spite of our long stay in this region, the species was not again positively recognized; but _Chætura cassini_, _C. stictilæma_ and _C. sabinei_ were all of common occurrence there.   =Apaloderma minus= sp. nov.  Resembling _Apaloderma narina_, but decidedly smaller, of different coloration, and with bill less swollen. The serration of the maxilla is less pronounced.  The adult male of _A. minus_ is distinguished by the bluer hue of the forehead, throat, and upper breast, which show in certain lights deep violet reflections, and by the more scarlet, less crimson color of the remaining underparts. In life the naked areas on the cheeks are bright yellow, whereas in _A. narina_ they are light green.  The adult female differs in the more tawny or ochraceous coloration of the breast, which is grayish in this sex of _A. narina_, although sometimes washed with light brown on the upper breast. A greenish gloss on the upper breast is more common in females of _A. narina_.  In juvenal plumage both species are entirely buff below, the feathers more or less tipped with dusky.       Type: collector's No. 4983. Congo Exp. A. M. N. H. [Male] ad.      Avakubi Ituri District, Belgian Congo, August 13, 1913.       _Description of Adult Male_ (type).--Throat, upper breast, lores      and forehead glossy wall-green, in certain lights with violet      reflections; upper tail-coverts much the same, but nape and back      brilliant peacock-green. Lower breast, sides, belly, and under      tail-coverts bright scarlet-red; feathering of legs dusky, with      faint green gloss and slightly bordered with whitish. Primaries      fuscous-black, the outer ones margined with white and the inner      ones white at the base. Alula and primary-coverts blackish;      lesser wing-coverts blackish, broadly margined with green; middle      coverts with less green and vermiculated with white. Greater      coverts and secondaries blackish vermiculated with white, the      former narrowly edged with green, the secondaries only very      faintly. Three middle pairs of rectrices blackish, slightly      glossed with violet-blue and margined with green; outer three      pairs white, with bases black faintly glossed with blue, this      blackish color extending out furthest on inner webs, and finally      breaking up into small dusky spots.       Iris red-brown; distal portion of bill light greenish gray, base      of bill and two naked patches beneath eye light cadmium-yellow,      naked skin above eye lemon-yellow; bare skin of foreneck (covered      in life by plumage) light blue; feet pale pink.       Length (skin) 254 mm.; length of bill (culmen from base) 18 mm.;      height of bill at nostril 9.5 mm.; greatest width of maxilla, near      gape, 16 mm.; wing (measured with dividers) 113 mm.; tail 146 mm.       In some of the other male specimens the green borders on the      secondaries are lacking, and the exact intensity of the white      vermiculation is of course variable. The measurements of a series      of 11 adult males are: bill, 17-18.5 mm.; wing, 108-115.5; tail,      136.5-151. This is smaller than any _Apaloderma_ heretofore      described.       _Adult Female._ Crown, back, and rump brilliant peacock-green,      upper tail-coverts viridian. Lores, forehead, and ear-coverts      more brownish; throat and upper breast snuff-brown, sometimes      with glossy green at sides of neck or a few narrow green borders      on the chest. Lower breast cinnamon, sometimes finely barred with      dusky; belly somewhat lighter and rosier than that of male;      feathering of legs dusky. Tail similar to that of male; but the      vermiculation on the wing-coverts and secondaries is very much      finer, and light ochraceous-buff, not white.       Iris red-brown; naked cheek-patches lemon-yellow, base of bill      slightly deeper yellow; culmen dusky, bill light green below;      feet flesh-color, claws gray.       Measurements of three adult females: bill (culmen from base),      17-17.5 mm.; wing 104.5-113 mm.; tail, 140-149 mm.       An _immature male_ has the green of the upper breast broken by      irregular bars of cinnamon. The lower breast is cinnamon mixed      with rose, and barred at the sides with green, and shades to      light scarlet-red on belly and under tail-coverts. The greater      wing-coverts and three inner secondaries bear each a large spot      of light ochraceous buff, extending across the whole width of the      innermost secondary, and most of the secondaries are vermiculated      or speckled on their outer webs with buff. Just behind the eye      there is a small spot of white, and the lower edge of the      ear-coverts is marked by a buff line.       Iris dark brown; maxilla dusky, but its base greenish-yellow like      the naked cheek-patches, mandible light yellowish-green, with      light-gray tip; feet pinkish. Bill, 18.5 mm.; wing, 108; tail, 139.       A _nestling_ ([Male]), with tail only 25 mm. long, is of a      yellower green above (calliste green); lores, forehead and entire      underparts cinnamon-buff, the downy feathers slightly tipped with      dusky except on abdomen. The wing-coverts and inner secondaries      bear large spots of buff. Iris brownish-gray; bill very light      bluish-gray, its base and corners of mouth greenish-yellow; feet      pale flesh-color, claws gray.       The spots on the inner secondaries, in the first plumage, appear      to be much larger in the case of _A. minus_ than with _A.      narina_, for an immature female specimen of the latter shows only      rounded spots on the outer webs not exceeding 5.5 mm. in diameter,      while the additional buffy speckling is practically absent.  This trogon was found by us in the Ituri forest, from the Nepoko River south to Avakubi and westward to Banalia, but its range is certainly wider than this. It is a species perfectly distinct from _Apaloderma narina_, but both occur in the same forests, though the latter was also to be heard at times in areas of tall second-growth, whereas _A. minus_ seemed never to leave the primitive uncut forest, and was extremely shy and difficult to observe. These two trogons may easily be recognized by their voices, the common note of _A. narina_ being a double, dove-like \"cu-coo,\" which is repeated slowly for several seconds, starting faintly but increasing in strength, and accompanied by a slight wagging of the tail. That of _A. minus_ is a series of longer, more mournful sounds that might be represented by the word \"kwaw.\" These calls are given by the males.  As compared with the measurements given in Prof. Reichenow's \"Vögel Afrikas\" and the British Museum Catalogue, our specimens of _Apaloderma narina_ from the Ituri District seem rather small, and may belong to the race _æquatoriale_ of Dr. Sharpe.
