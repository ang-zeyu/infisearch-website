Its value would in this case be       liable to variations of two different kinds: first, to those which arise       from the different quantities of gold and silver which are contained at       different times in coin of the same denomination; and, secondly, to those       which arise from the different values of equal quantities of gold and       silver at different times.            Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a       temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in       their coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it.       The quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations,       has accordingly been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever       augmenting. Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the       value of a money rent.            The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and       silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though I       apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is       likely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this supposition,       therefore, such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the       value of a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not       in such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many       pounds sterling, for example), but in so many ounces, either of pure       silver, or of silver of a certain standard.            The rents which have been reserved in corn, have preserved their value       much better than those which have been reserved in money, even where the       denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth,       it was enacted, that a third of the rent of all college leases should be       reserved in corn, to be paid either in kind, or according to the current       prices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn       rent, though originally but a third of the whole, is, in the present       times, according to Dr. Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises       from the other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according       to this account, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value,       or are worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were       formerly worth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary, the denomination       of the English coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same       number of pounds, shillings, and pence, have contained very nearly the       same quantity of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of       the money rents of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in       the price of silver.            When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the       diminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same       denomination, the loss is frequently still greater. In Scotland, where the       denomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than it       ever did in England, and in France, where it has undergone still greater       than it ever did in Scotland, some ancient rents, originally of       considerable value, have, in this manner, been reduced almost to nothing.            Equal quantities of labour will, at distant times, be purchased more       nearly with equal quantities of corn, the subsistence of the labourer,       than with equal quantities of gold and silver, or, perhaps, of any other       commodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times, be       more nearly of the same real value, or enable the possessor to purchase or       command more nearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They       will do this, I say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other       commodity; for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The       subsistence of the labourer, or the real price of labour, as I shall       endeavour to shew hereafter, is very different upon different occasions;       more liberal in a society advancing to opulence, than in one that is       standing still, and in one that is standing still, than in one that is       going backwards. Every other commodity, however, will, at any particular       time, purchase a greater or smaller quantity of labour, in proportion to       the quantity of subsistence which it can purchase at that time. A rent,       therefore, reserved in corn, is liable only to the variations in the       quantity of labour which a certain quantity of corn can purchase. But a       rent reserved in any other commodity is liable, not only to the variations       in the quantity of labour which any particular quantity of corn can       purchase, but to the variations in the quantity of corn which can be       purchased by any particular quantity of that commodity.            Though the real value of a corn rent, it is to be observed, however,       varies much less from century to century than that of a money rent, it       varies much more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I shall       endeavour to shew hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with the       money price of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the       temporary or occasional, but to the average or ordinary price of that       necessary of life. The average or ordinary price of corn, again is       regulated, as I shall likewise endeavour to shew hereafter, by the value       of silver, by the richness or barrenness of the mines which supply the       market with that metal, or by the quantity of labour which must be       employed, and consequently of corn which must be consumed, in order to       bring any particular quantity of silver from the mine to the market. But       the value of silver, though it sometimes varies greatly from century to       century, seldom varies much from year to year, but frequently continues       the same, or very nearly the same, for half a century or a century       together. The ordinary or average money price of corn, therefore, may,       during so long a period, continue the same, or very nearly the same, too,       and along with it the money price of labour, provided, at least, the       society continues, in other respects, in the same, or nearly in the same,       condition. In the mean time, the temporary and occasional price of corn       may frequently be double one year of what it had been the year before, or       fluctuate, for example, from five-and-twenty to fifty shillings the       quarter. But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but       the real value of a corn rent, will be double of what it is when at the       former, or will command double the quantity either of labour, or of the       greater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and along       with it that of most other things, continuing the same during all these       fluctuations.            Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as       the only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can       compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all       places. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different       commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were       given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities       of corn. By the quantities of labour, we can, with the greatest accuracy,       estimate it, both from century to century, and from year to year. From       century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from       century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same       quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year       to year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because       equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of       labour.            But though, in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long       leases, it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal price; it       is of none in buying and selling, the more common and ordinary       transactions of human life.            At the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all       commodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or less       money you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the       more or less labour it will at that time and place enable you to purchase       or command. At the same time and place, therefore, money is the exact       measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is so,       however, at the same time and place only.            Though at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real       and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods       from the one to the other, has nothing to consider but the money price, or       the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them, and       that for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver at       Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and of the       necessaries and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A       commodity, therefore, which sells for half an ounce of silver at Canton,       may there be really dearer, of more real importance to the man who       possesses it there, than a commodity which sells for an ounce at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],["title","Ducks and Geese (#0)"],["body","H.P.

S. A.     PREFACE   Of all lines of poultry keeping, duck raising is unique in that it lends itself to the greatest degree of specialization and intensification along lines which are purely commercial. On a comparatively small area thousands of ducklings can be reared and marketed yearly. The call for information concerning the methods used by these commercial duck raisers has been considerable, and since such information is not available in complete concise form the present book has been prepared partly to furnish just this information.  The methods used by successful Long Island duck raisers differ widely in some particulars and since in the space at command, it has been impossible to describe all the methods used, the plan has been adopted of detailing in the main the methods of one successful grower. This it is believed will prove to be more helpful and less confusing than to attempt to give the method of several different men.  Much space has been given to the operations of the commercial duck raisers but the fact is recognized that the great bulk of the ducks entering into the trade of the country is the product of small flocks kept on general farms. For this reason a chapter has been added dealing with duck raising on the farm, and attention is here called to the fact that most of the information given under commercial duck raising can be readily adapted to use in connection with the farm flock.  Detailed, complete information on goose raising is even more fragmentary than is the case with ducks. Yet there is a fine opportunity to rear a few geese at a profit on many farms, and the need and call for information is quite general. It is for this reason that a section of this book has been devoted to goose raising and in that section all the good reliable information available on the subject is given. The special attention of the women of the farm is directed to the opportunity which goose raising offers to make a good profit on a small side line with the minimum of initial investment and of labor.  The greatest care has been taken to make the information on both duck and goose raising as complete and clear as possible. However, the authors appreciate the unlimited value of good illustrations in making clear methods and operations which are more difficult to grasp from a word description, and have therefore assembled a set of illustrations for this book, the completeness and excellence of which have never before been approached in any book on the subject. The illustrations alone are an education.  In preparing and presenting this book to the public, the authors take pleasure in acknowledging their deep indebtedness to the following persons for help and information furnished:  Roy E. Pardee John C. Kriner Charles McClave Stanley Mason Dr. Balliet William Minnich George W. Hackett Dawson Brothers  Particular acknowledgment is due Robert A. Tuttle for the manner in which he threw open his duck plant to the authors and for the most generous amount of time which he gave in furnishing information.  Special acknowledgment is likewise due Alfred R. Lee, Poultryman, U. S. Department of Agriculture, for information secured from his Farmers' Bulletins on duck raising and goose raising.
