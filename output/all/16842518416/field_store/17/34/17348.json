When the heart whispers \"Spare\" and justice says \"Smite,\" men must obey the voice of justice, stifling the voice of the heart.  Our prayers are now for justice.  Better far a righteous war than an immoral peace.  We have been compelled to unsheath the sword, and we pray that no heart may falter, and no cry arise for the sheathing of the sword, until justice be done.  Thus our prayers have become a cry for victory.  ***  As one sits in an ancient church such as this, there comes knocking at the heart many questions regarding that service of prayer which within its walls has linked the generations together.  Can prayer really prevail with God?  Can it alter the will of the Unchangeable?  If there be no power in it, why should men go on praying?  We must distinguish between the will of God which is unchangeable, and His lower will which is his purpose towards us and His attitude to us. The former is unalterable; the latter varies according to the varying of our hearts.  With that lower will we are called to wrestle.  A man is born in poverty and obscurity, and the will of God seems to be that he should continue poor and obscure.  But he wrestles with that lower will until he prevails.  He ultimately moves out into the great tide of life and becomes a power.  The will of God towards that man is changed.  It is the same with a nation.  Here is a nation sinking on its lees with its ideals dimmed and the shrines of its fathers' God forsaken and desolate.  It has fashioned to itself other gods, and the multitudes crowd the temples of the goddess of pleasure.  The very race itself is sacrificed on the altar of gross pleasure, and the laughter of little children is being little by little silenced.  The fires of patriotism are dying low, and the love of country gives place to the love of party.  There are mean victories rejoiced over, but they are the victories of the cynic and the sensualist.  There is the sound of shouting, but it is the shouting over the triumph of one self-seeking politician over another self-seeking partisan.  Saintliness, which other generations held in awe and reverence, provokes now a pitying smile.  Mammon alone is held in high honour and sitteth in the high places.  What is the will of God towards that nation?  It is this--ruin and utter destruction.  Over every nation that thus succumbed to the gross and sensual, history shows the sword of God unsheathed, and at last the devouring flames of judgment.  But to such a nation there comes as if out of the silent heaven a call as a trumpet sound, summoning it to the judgment-seat of God.  Over the sea comes the roar of guns.  The foundations which the fathers laid in righteousness, through long neglect and decay are crumbling.  An empire encircling the globe is tottering to destruction.  The hay and the stubble cannot come scathless through the flames.  The writing is on the wall, and as the eyes see the hand that writes, trembling seizeth upon men.  And then there cometh a sudden change.  The nation in a day rises out of the morass of its self-indulgence.  It sets itself to lay hold again upon the eternal law of righteousness.  They seek once more the shrines of their God.  They set themselves to fast and to pray. \"Who can tell,\" they whisper one to another, \"if God will turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?\"  The fields of their inglorious shouting over their games are deserted for the fields of hardness and grim preparation.  Once more they gird themselves for conflict, as their fathers so often girded, that truth and righteousness may prevail over all the earth.  Sharply the choice is presented to them between Christ or Odin, and though choosing the Christ means agony and woe they make their choice unhesitatingly.  A new light shines in their eyes, and the work of their hands and the devisings of their hearts become the spirit of prayer.  Yesterday the will of God towards that nation, sinking on its lees, was destruction; to-day towards that same nation, thus risen out of the foul miasma that was stifling its soul, the will of God is salvation.  Because prayer is the greatest power in the world; because it can alter the will of God towards us, because it can move the hand of the omnipotent God and is thus endued with His omnipotence, our prayers as we gather in the sanctuaries are no longer the submission of quietism, but a wrestling with God--the crying of a soul as in agony for victory based on the triumph of righteousness.  It was such a cry that rose on that day in St. Giles.  ***  As the second paraphrase was being sung there came the memory of words spoken in the pulpit of the great Cathedral by Dr. Cameron Lees.  It was at evening service, when the shadows were gathering.  \"I have often sat in this pulpit,\" said Dr. Lees, \"on the edge of the evening, and watched the shadows enveloping the Cathedral.  They invaded the side chapels first, and then the nave, creeping onwards through the transepts, until the chancel was reached.  After that they gathered in strength, until the whole building was in darkness, with the exception of the white figure of Christ in the great east window.  I pray that the last vision vouchsafed me on earth may be just that--the Saviour of men.  I can then close my eyes in the knowledge that He will lead me through the dark valley that leadeth to the eternal home.\"  It has been like that with the whole nation.  Around our shores the darkness gathered, until all the horizon was black with threatening clouds.  Then we lifted up our eyes and saw....  He will bring deliverance and peace.  As we moved along the crowded aisles towards the door the white figure of Christ glowed in the great east window, and we felt that He will bless His people at last with peace--the peace not of death, but of life.    \"Down the dark future, through long generations,     The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease,   And, like a bell, with solemn sweet vibrations,     I hear once more the voice of Christ say Peace.   Peace! and no longer from its brazen portals     The clash of war's great organ shakes the skies;   But beautiful as songs of the immortals,     The holy melodies of love arise.\"     V  The Victory    V  The blinds were all drawn in the red-roofed house that stands at the cross-roads.  It was not empty, for the smoke arose from its chimneys in the clear morning air.  In other days the music of song and laughter often floated from its open windows, but now it was stricken dumb. From it two sons had gone to take their place in the line of soul and fire that girdles these islands, warding them from destruction.  In a moment the veiled windows flashed their meaning.  In the long lists of the dead I found the name I looked for.  I had schooled myself to look at these lists, thinking of them in the mass as force or power; but that one name insisted on its individuality.  They were all individual lives, each throbbing with intensest self-realisation, each with his love and hope and fear.  There was none among them so poor but some heart clung to them.  They may die, no longer in units, but in broad swathes, mown down by machine guns, but they are individual hearts still.  In masses the sea swallows them up, trenches are filled with them, but however much we try we cannot narcotise our hearts by sophistries.  Some day a name stands out alone--and we realise.  All over the land, in every parish, blinds are being drawn in houses where music and laughter are silenced.  There comes the surge of a wild revolt.  It is not these individual hearts alone that lie stricken, it is the joy of the centuries yet to be.  In nameless graves lie the dream-children who will never now be born.  This criminal sealing up of the very fountain of life--how can we bear it?  And yet we open not our mouths in protest.  Is it because we are losing our sensitiveness--becoming brutalised?  It might be that.  For nothing coarsens the mind like that tide of hatred and passion which war sends sweeping through the hearts of men.  And yet it is not that.  For when they told the mother, breaking it gently as love alone can do, that her son was dead, she bowed her head in silence, yielding herself to the solace of tears; but in a little while she said brokenly: \"It is good to die so: I would not have my son shelter himself behind other mothers' sons.\"  No, it is not because we are already coarsened that the heart can bear. It is rather because we have realised with the passing away of the old world of the last long summer days (it seems already centuries remote) that there are some things so great that they can transfigure even death.  When the loyalty to the highest can only be fulfilled through death, we acquiesce in the sacrifice.  In our parish we have not been coarsened--we have been quickened.  ***  It seems as if it were in another era that my friend at the top of the Gallows' Road proved to me convincingly that death alone was king. With a keen irony he depicted this little globule of a world, a third-rate satellite of a fifth-rate star, floating in the abysses, in relation to the universe but as a mere grain of sand amid all the sand on the world's shores; and on that puny speck of a world he pictured the ephemeral generations, mere flashes of troubled consciousness--and then darkness.  It was reasonable when they thought this world the centre of all things, with the sun and moon and stars circling it round as humble ministrants, that they should believe in some high destiny for themselves.  But now that they know how miserably and unspeakably insignificant the world is, it was but vanity and arrogance for any man to think of himself as of any value whatever in the scheme of things. His life was as the flashing of a midge's wings.  His end was as a candle blown out in the night.  ***  One evening, when the air was vibrant with the melody "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33639"],["title","The Subspecific Status of Two Central American Sloths (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net.

KELSON   New name combinations for two kinds of Central American sloths that heretofore have stood in the literature as nominal species are given below, along with the evidence supporting their relegation to subspecific rank. Research assistance has been provided from a contract (NR 161-791) between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas.   ~Bradypus griseus ignavus~ Goldman  Goldman (Smiths. Misc. Coll., 60(22):1, February 28, 1913) named the three-toed sloth from extreme eastern Panamá (Marraganti: 1 specimen, the type) and northwestern Colombia (Atrato River: 2 specimens) as _Bradypus ignavus_. He characterized the newly-named species as differing from _Bradypus griseus_ (type locality Cordillera de Chucu, Veragua, Panamá) and _Bradypus castaneiceps_ (type locality, Chontales, Nicaragua) in \"nasals shorter, with anterior border concave or emarginate, the emargination deepest at median suture; squamosal arm of zygoma broader, more rounded, less acutely pointed anteriorly; palate less deeply grooved posteriorly; symphysis of mandible less produced anteriorly beyond plane of first molars.\" Later, Goldman (Smiths. Misc. Coll., 69(5):57-58, April 24, 1920) arranged _Bradypus castaneiceps_ as a subspecies of _B. griseus_, reaffirmed the full specific identity of _Bradypus ignavus_, and identified specimens from Tapalisa, Cituro, and Real de Santa Maria, all in eastern Panamá, as belonging to _B. ignavus_.  In order to satisfy ourselves about the taxonomic relationship of _B. ignavus_ to _B. griseus_, we have examined the following materials in the American Museum of Natural History: _ignavus_: Panamá: Cituro (No. 38191), Tapalisa (No. 38102), Real de Santa Maria (Nos. 37619-37621); _griseus_: Panamá: La Chorrera (No. 31427); Costa Rica: Juan Viñas (No. 2824), Palmar (No. 139313), Vijagual, San Carlos (No. 139833); _castaneiceps_: Nicaragua: Chontales (Nos. 28477 and 28478).  The specimens from Real de Santa Maria, Tapalisa, and Cituro, average darker than all others, but this darkness is approached in certain specimens of _griseus_ (for example, No. 139833, from Vijagual, San Carlos). The broader, more rounded and less acutely pointed squamosal arm of the zygoma supposedly characteristic of _ignavus_ is matched in certain specimens of _griseus_ (for example, in No. 2824 from Juan Viñas, Costa Rica) and the character is variable among specimens referred to _ignavus_; the shape of the squamosal arm is of doubtful taxonomic worth in the present connection. The depth of the grooving on the palate seems to vary with age and is of questionable value taxonomically. The emarginate nasals of _ignavus_ are matched in _griseus_ (No. 139833) from Vijagual, San Carlos, Costa Rica. The extension of the anterior symphyseal region of the mandible is short in _ignavus_; the specimen with the longest extension (No. 37621 from El Real), however, has the extension only barely shorter than does No. 139933 of _griseus_ from Vijagual, San Carlos, Costa Rica. In brief, while we see the characters of _ignavus_ as set forth by Goldman (_op. cit._), we find them to be of only an average sort and not pronounced. Further, a specimen (No. 139833) from Vijagual, San Carlos, Costa Rica, provides a morphological intergrade between _griseus_ and _ignavus_. Accordingly, we arrange _ignavus_ as a subspecies of _griseus_; the name of the animal from extreme eastern Panamá should stand as _Bradypus griseus ignavus_ Goldman, 1913.   ~Cyclopes didactylus mexicanus~ Hollister  Hollister (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 127:210, October 31, 1914) named _Cyclopes mexicanus_, on the basis of light-golden upper parts and large, especially broad, auditory bullae, as specifically distinct from _Cyclopes dorsalis_ Gray (= _Cyclopes tridactylus dorsalis_ Gray). Our comparisons and examination of the specimens used by Hollister and a few other specimens acquired since 1914 convince us that _C. mexicanus_ is taxonomically valid and that Hollister, in general, correctly indicated its diagnostic characters. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that _C. mexicanus_ is only subspecifically distinct from _C. dorsalis_. In the first place, an adult _C. dorsalis_, not seen by Hollister, from El Banco, Chiriquí, Panamá (No. 248343 USBS), has more inflated, although narrower, auditory bullae than do specimens of _C. mexicanus_. In the second place, the two specimens mentioned by Hollister (_loc. cit._) as from \"Tabasco and southern Vera Cruz\" actually are both from Tabasco (No. 100040 USBS from Teapa, and No. 100174 USBS from Montecristo). Each, as Hollister indicated, is darker on the upper parts than his other referred specimens (two others from Montecristo in Tabasco and another from El Salto in Chiapas). To us this suggests intergradation with _C. dorsalis_. Incidentally, the specimen that Hollister mentioned from Veracruz (No. 78111 USBS, from Minatitlan), and that he indicated as having dark upper parts, really has light upper parts. Third, a skin from Petén, Libertad, Guatemala (Harry Malleis field No. 504, immature female), that the late Major E. A. Goldman and one of us (Hall) once examined, has considerable dark brown on the chin, throat and midventral line, as well as a dark mid-dorsal stripe. The specimen is intermediate in color, as well as geographically, between _C. t. dorsalis_ and _C. mexicanus_, although referable to the latter. Taken together, the above evidence indicates subspecific status for the northern, Mexican, animal and we conclude that it should stand as _Cyclopes tridactylus mexicanus_ Hollister.  _Transmitted July 1, 1952._"]]]
