I am sure that I could do it just as well as a boy.\"  \"But this would necessitate a journey into the enemy's country. A bright boy could go through all right if he would exercise his wits, but a tender, delicate girl like you! Why, I couldn't think of it!\"  \"I could do just as well as a boy,\" declared Jeanne with conviction. \"I am sure that I could. Please let me try, father.\"  \"I am sorry that I spoke of it, child. I will tell you just what the service is, and you will see the impossibility of any girl undertaking it. In the cities both North and South there are men whose duty it is to look after certain private matters for the government. In our communications with each other we must be very guarded. We do not dare to risk even the mails, because in almost every department of the service there are traitors. In some mysterious manner the enemy becomes aware of all our plans. Therefore we have tried and trusted men who are our go betweens. On some occasions we have employed boys because they could pass through the lines of the armies without being suspected of carrying important information. But as it is a hazardous business we use the boys only when there is no one else to send. Just at present our men are all out, and even the few boys who are ordinarily available are not on hand. That is why I spoke as I did.\"  \"Where would the boy have to go?\" queried Jeanne, who had listened attentively.  \"To New Orleans, dear. It is a long distance, and would be a perilous journey. You see, Jeanne, how I am trusting you. You will be careful not to repeat anything I say.\"  \"I understand perfectly, father. You need not fear when you tell me anything. You could not be useful if others knew of your affairs.\"  \"That is it precisely, my daughter.\"  \"Is the errand important, father?\"  \"Very.\" Mr. Vance thought she saw the impossibility of going and therefore spoke more freely than he otherwise would have done. \"I ought to send a messenger not later than day after to-morrow with the documents, but I fear that I shall have to let the matter rest until some of the men come in, and then it may be too late.\"  \"Father, doesn't Uncle Ben live in New Orleans?\"  \"Yes, Jeanne; why?\"  \"Why couldn't I go down to see him, and carry these papers hidden about me? The trains are still running, aren't they?\"  \"Yes,\" said her father thoughtfully; \"but those in the Southern States are under Confederate control, you know.\"  \"Well, suppose I were to take the train from here to St. Louis,\" mapping the route on her lap, \"then from there I could go down the Mississippi on a steamboat. St. Louis is for the Union, and New Orleans belongs to us now too. I don't see much danger in that, father.\"  \"It sounds all right, little girl. The only flaw lies in the fact that Vicksburg is not ours. If it were then the matter could be easily arranged.\"  \"Don't you think that it will be ours soon, father?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" replied Mr. Vance with conviction. \"With Farragut and Porter on the river and this new man Grant who is making such a record in charge of the land forces it will not be long before Vicksburg will share the fate of Forts Henry and Donelson and Island No. 10. Indeed,\" added he, for Mr. Vance in common with many others held the view that the war could not be of long duration, \"I feel sure that McClellan will soon enter Richmond and that will virtually close the war. It is only a question of days now before we shall see the end of this rebellion. The administration is of the same opinion, because it has ceased to enlist men for the army.\"  \"Then, father, it seems to me that there would be no risk in performing this service for you. I feel sure that I could carry your papers safely to New Orleans. It is not as if the country all belonged to the rebels. There would be only one place to pass that is theirs: Vicksburg. I know that our men can easily go by one place,\" she added confidently.  \"Your manner of taking hold of the matter almost persuades me to let you try it, Jeanne,\" and Mr. Vance regarded his daughter with a new light in his eyes.  \"Do,\" said Jeanne as calmly as she could, realizing that if she would carry her point she must be very matter-of-fact. \"You see, father, no one would suspect a girl of carrying papers.\"  \"I don't know but that you are right, Jeanne. Still, I would not consider the thing for an instant if my need were not so great. Should the papers fall into the rebels' hands, not only would they secure important information but they would also get the names of men whose death would pay the penalty of discovery.\"  \"I understand,\" said the girl gravely. \"But the rebels shall never get them, father. I will destroy them first. They must be concealed about my clothing in such a manner that even if I were searched they could not be discovered. Not that I think that I shall be,\" she added hastily as a look of alarm flitted over her father's face, \"but it is just as well to be prepared for emergencies.\"  \"What are you two plotting?\" asked Mrs. Vance entering the room. \"You have been talking so earnestly that I thought that you were settling the affairs of the nation.\"  \"We have been,\" answered Jeanne gaily. \"I am going to New Orleans on business for father.\"  \"Oh, Richard,\" came from Mrs. Vance in a wailing cry. \"Not my girl too! I have given my boy! Leave me my daughter.\"  \"Mother!\" Jeanne sprang to her outstretched arms where she was folded close to the mother's heart. \"You don't understand. There is no danger. Who would harm a girl like me?\"  \"She shall not go, Dora, if you do not consent,\" spoke Mr. Vance comfortingly. \"My need for a messenger was so urgent that I spoke of it before Jeanne, and the little witch has beguiled me into thinking that she is the very one for the business.\"  \"Why of course I am,\" cried Jeanne in decided tones. \"Let's sit down and talk it over.\"  \"I don't like it,\" said Mrs. Vance after the matter had been explained. \"I am afraid that something will happen to you.\"  \"But, mother, what could happen? Even if I were to fall into the hands of the Confederates what could they do to me? Men don't make war on girls.\"  \"I know that the Southern people are counted chivalrous,\" answered Mrs. Vance, \"but soldiers are usually rough fellows, and I would not like you to be brought into contact with them even though they were our own boys.\"  \"Dick is a soldier, and he isn't a bit rough. They are all somebody's sons, mother. I thought that you liked soldiers.\"  \"I do,\" assented Mrs. Vance wearily, \"but I don't like the thought of sending you where there is a chance of fighting. No one knows what might happen.\"  \"Dick has to take a great many chances, and why should not I risk a little for my country? Wouldn't you be willing to give your life for it, mother?\"  \"Yes; but----\" began the mother.  \"And I am your child,\" cried Jeanne, kissing her. \"I can't help it, mother. It's in the blood, and blood will tell, you know. Haven't I heard you and father many a time relate what great things our ancestors did in the Revolution? Well, you really can't expect anything else from their descendants.\"  \"I suppose not,\" and Mrs. Vance stifled a sigh. \"If it really would help you, Richard.\"  \"It really would, Dora. If Jeanne can carry these papers to New Orleans she is not only worth her weight in gold but she will do the government a great service. She is energetic, resourceful and self-reliant. I believe that she can get through without injury to herself or I should not consider the thing a moment. As she says, why should harm come to a girl? She would not be suspected where older people would be subjected to the most searching scrutiny. The more that I think of it, the more favorably does the idea strike me.\"  \"Then I must consent,\" Mrs. Vance smiled faintly though her face was very white. \"My country demands much of me, Richard.\"  \"It does, Dora. But please God when this rebellion is put down we shall have such peace as the country has never enjoyed. Let us hope for the best, dear.\"  \"When do I start, father?\" broke in Jeanne.  \"I think to-morrow night. The sooner the better. I will see about your transportation in the morning, and try to arrange to send you straight through. Now, little girl, you must say good-night because we must be up bright and early. There is a great deal to be done to-morrow.\"  \"Good-night,\" said Jeanne obediently, and kissing each tenderly she retired to her room.     CHAPTER III  STARTING FOR DIXIE   The next day passed all too quickly for the parents, but not for Jeanne. She went about her preparations with an uplifted mien and a solemnity of manner that at another time would have been amusing, but which under the circumstances went to her mother's heart.  \"In this petticoat, dear, I have quilted the documents,\" said Mrs. Vance as she dressed her for her departure. \"It may be a little heavy, but you need not wear so many skirts as you otherwise would, and perhaps it will not be too warm. See how nicely it holds out your dress. It almost answers the purpose of a pair of hoops.\"  \"Am I not to wear my hoops, mother?\"  \"No, child. They are sometimes in the way, and as you have not yet learned to manage them well, it would be best not. Your frock hangs out in quite the approved style as it is.\"  Jeanne glanced down at her attire complacently.  \"It does look stylish,\" she admitted. \"I wonder if the rebel girls wear hoops.\"  \"I dare say they do,\" answered the mother rather absently. Then overcome by a rush of emotion she caught the girl to her. \"Oh, Jeanne, I wonder if I am doing right to let you go! What if some harm should come to you?\"  \"Don't worry, mother,\" and Jeanne soothed her gently. \"I feel sure that I will get through safely.\"  \"I shall not be easy until I hold you in my arms again,\" said Mrs. Vance mournfully. \"But I must not make it hard for you to go, dear. You will be careful, Jeanne.\"  \"Yes, mother.\"  \"And, child, you are loyal,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32993"],["title","A Daughter of the Union (#3)"],["body"," know, but you are very young. You are going into the enemy's country, where disloyalty to the Union will be the common utterance. Are you strong enough to bear all that you will hear and still retain that fidelity unimpaired?\"  \"Mother!\" Jeanne spoke reproachfully.  \"Yes; I know that your heart is devoted to your country, but older ones than you have been drawn from their allegiance. I only give this as a caution because you have always been where nothing but the Union has been talked. Now you are apt to hear just as much on the other side, and there may be trials that will test your strength severely. I cannot but fear that all will not go so smoothly as your father thinks. But, Jeanne, whatever comes, bear yourself as a true American. Swerve not from the allegiance due to your country. Let come what will, even death itself, suffer it rather than for one moment to be false to your country. They are my last words to you, my daughter. Be true to your country. Will you remember?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the girl solemnly. \"Whatever comes I will be true to my country.\"  \"I have made you this flag,\" continued Mrs. Vance, drawing a small United States flag from the folds of her dress. \"I began it some time ago as a surprise for your birthday, but finished it last night for you to take with you. Keep it about your person, and each night look upon it and pray for the success of the Union.\"  \"And it is really my own,\" exclaimed Jeanne, delightedly, pressing the silken folds to her lips. \"It makes me so happy to have it, mother. I never had one before that was all mine. See,\" folding it and placing it in the bosom of her dress, \"I will wear it over my heart that no disloyal thought may find entrance there. I will bring it back to you unsullied.\"  Her mother pressed her again to her breast.  \"I believe it, dear. Now kiss me, Jeanne. I hear your father coming for you. Oh, 'tis hard to let you go!\" She clasped her convulsively to her, and caressed her repeatedly.  \"Are you ready, Jeanne?\" asked Mr. Vance entering. \"We have not much time left.\"  \"I am all ready, father,\" answered Jeanne quickly catching up her satchel. \"Aren't you coming with us, mother?\"  \"No, dear;\" Mrs. Vance struggled bravely with her emotion. \"I am going to let your father have you for the last few moments alone. I have had you all day, you know.\"  Jeanne ran back to her for another embrace.  \"My child! My child!\" whispered the mother passionately. \"There! Go while I can bear it.\"  Unable to speak Jeanne followed her father to the carriage.  \"I am afraid that I have acted hastily in letting you undertake this matter,\" said her father, drawing her to him. \"In one way the fates are propitious. The papers to-day announce the fall of Vicksburg. That leaves the Mississippi entirely open and reduces the danger. Still it may be exposing you to some risk, and it now seems to me unwise to saddle so great a responsibility upon so young a girl. I wish there was some one else to send.\"  \"Father, I am glad to be of service. I am so proud to think that you have so trusted me. Now I am really doing something for the country. And I will not betray your trust.\"  \"I know that you will be as true as steel,\" answered Mr. Vance tenderly. \"I do not fear that you will betray my confidence, but let me caution you for yourself. Where have you concealed the papers?\"  \"Mother quilted them in my petticoat,\" answered Jeanne.  \"Then try to forget where they are. I was once on the train where a girl was traveling alone. She had evidently been warned against pickpockets, for ever and anon she would start up and clap her hand to her pocket. Do you see the point, daughter?\"  \"It showed plainly where she kept her money,\" replied Jeanne promptly.  \"Exactly. If you keep fingering the petticoat it will show to every one that there is something concealed there. Therefore forget all about the papers if you can. Act as naturally as a little girl would going to visit her uncle. There must of course be a reason for your going and I have provided for that in this way. Quinine is a contraband article and highly prized in the South. This basket has a false bottom. Above is a lunch for your journey and underneath a quantity of quinine. You may get through without falling into the Confederates' hands but it is just as well to be prepared for emergencies, as you remarked last night. Should you happen to be taken by them and they question you too closely, finally confess about the quinine. It will be a point in your favor that you have smuggled it through the Union lines. Should they take it no matter. Do you understand?\"  \"Perfectly.\"  \"I have secured transportation to Memphis, Tennessee,\" continued Mr. Vance. \"It brings you closer to New Orleans and leaves a shorter distance to be traversed by water. You will have to change cars twice. Once at Washington City which you can do easily as you have been there a number of times. The other is at Cincinnati, Ohio. Do you think you can manage it?\"  \"Why, of course I can,\" said Jeanne proudly. \"It isn't as if I had never been anywhere.\"  \"Yes, that makes a difference,\" assented her father. \"Yet, my child, remember that before you have been accompanied by either your mother or me. Now you will have to rely entirely upon yourself. This is a letter for Commodore Porter who is a friend of mine, and who is somewhere on the Mississippi. Ask for him as soon as you reach Memphis. If he is not there there will be others on our side who will carry you down the river after reading the letter. If at any time you are in doubt what to do go to the hospitals. There are always women there who will gladly give whatever aid you may need. And here is money.\"  \"Mother gave me some,\" interrupted Jeanne who had listened with the closest attention.  \"Yes; that is in your purse, which is in the satchel, is it not?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, take this also. I had this bag made to hold it.\" He put a roll of bills into an oilskin bag and drew the cord so that the opening closed tightly together. \"Wear that about your neck, child, and keep it hidden under your dress,\" he said. \"Keep that always about you as a reserve fund. So long as you have money you can get along pretty well. Take out what you need from time to time, carrying only a small amount in your purse. Above all beware of talking too freely to strangers. Now for the final instructions: you are going to New Orleans to visit your Uncle Ben. When you reach there ask him to direct you to Mr. ------,\" here he whispered in her ear. \"Speak that name to no person. When you have delivered the papers into his hands your duty is done. Stay with your uncle until you hear from me. I will write you how to come home. Now, Jeanne, I think that this is all I have to say. If anything should happen that these arrangements fail, don't run any danger but return home. You see that I am leaving a great deal to your judgment. Can you remember everything that I have said?\"  \"Yes. And you may be sure that I will do just as you tell me. It seems to me that everything has been thought of and that there is no chance of failing.\"  \"Sometimes the best laid plans are thwarted,\" said her father gravely. \"It may not be a very wise thing to send my daughter on such an errand, but you are such a sensible little thing that I feel as if you would succeed.\"  \"I will,\" said Jeanne determinedly. \"I want to be worthy of my name, father. Did not another Jeanne not much older than I lead the Dauphin of France to a crown? Surely then I can do this thing which is small in comparison.\"  \"I am afraid we did wrong in giving you such a name,\" remarked her father smilingly. \"How full of the martial spirit you are, Jeanne. I believe that you would undertake the capture of Jeff Davis if I asked you to.\"  \"I would,\" exclaimed the girl with a look that boded ill for the rebel president. \"Perhaps we will try it yet.\"  \"We will get through this affair first, my dear. Here we are at the station. We'll have to make a run for that train.\"  They had taken a ferry during the conversation and by this time had reached Jersey City. Running through the gates they boarded the train just as the signal was given to pull out.  \"My little girl, good-bye,\" murmured Mr. Vance, clasping her to him for a brief second. \"God bless and keep you, Jeanne. May He bring you safely back. Be brave,\" he added, as he saw Jeanne's lips quivering.  \"I will,\" sobbed Jeanne, breaking down completely as her father started away. \"Oh, father, kiss me just once more.\"  \"Is it too much for you, my little girl?\" Mr. Vance held her closely. \"You need not go, Jeanne.\"  \"I want to. I am all right,\" gasped Jeanne, controlling herself by an effort. \"Now go, father, dear. See how brave I am.\"  She smiled up at him through her tears. Mr. Vance regarded her anxiously.  \"Go,\" whispered Jeanne as the train began to move. Hastily her father left her. Jeanne leaned from the window and waved her hand as long as she could see him. But soon the train rounded a curve and he was lost to view. Then leaning back in her seat she gave herself up to her tears.     CHAPTER IV  A TIMELY RENEWAL OF ACQUAINTANCE   Jeanne sobbed unrestrainedly for some time. A sense of forlornness oppressed her, and the magnitude of the task she had undertaken weighed upon her spirits. As Mr. Vance had said she had never traveled alone before, and now that she had actually started upon the journey a thousand fears assailed her. The idea of being engaged upon a mission that involved something of risk had seemed a noble thing, and easy of accomplishment in her own home. Here, lacking the sustaining presence of her parents, and the relaxation after the excitement of the day, made the enterprise seem formidable indeed. So absorbed was she in her meditations that she had not noticed the other occupants of the coach, but presently there was borne in upon her senses the sound of singing.  \"Oh, what is it?\" she exclaimed with a nervous start.  \"Some soldiers on their way to"]]]
