To prevent       such abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourage all sorts       of industry and commerce, it has been found necessary, in all countries       that have made any considerable advances towards improvement, to affix a       public stamp upon certain quantities of such particular metals, as were in       those countries commonly made use of to purchase goods. Hence the origin       of coined money, and of those public offices called mints; institutions       exactly of the same nature with those of the aulnagers and stamp-masters       of woollen and linen cloth. All of them are equally meant to ascertain, by       means of a public stamp, the quantity and uniform goodness of those       different commodities when brought to market.            The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current       metals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it was       both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or       fineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at       present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which is       sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which, being struck only upon one       side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the       fineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the       four hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of       Machpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the       merchant, and yet are received by weight, and not by tale, in the same       manner as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues       of the ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in       money, but in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts.       William the Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This       money, however, was for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight,       and not by tale.            The inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness,       gave occasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering       entirely both sides of the piece, and sometimes the edges too, was       supposed to ascertain not only the fineness, but the weight of the metal.       Such coins, therefore, were received by tale, as at present, without the       trouble of weighing.            The denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the       weight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius       Tullius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a       Roman pound of good copper. It was divided, in the same manner as our       Troyes pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of       good copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I.       contained a pound, Tower weight, of silver of a known fineness. The Tower       pound seems to have been something more than the Roman pound, and       something less than the Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into       the mint of England till the 18th of Henry the VIII. The French livre       contained, in the time of Charlemagne, a pound, Troyes weight, of silver       of a known fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time       frequented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of       so famous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money       pound contained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert       Bruce, a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the English       pound sterling. English, French, and Scots pennies, too, contained all of       them originally a real penny-weight of silver, the twentieth part of an       ounce, and the two hundred-and-fortieth part of a pound. The shilling,       too, seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight. “When       wheat is at twelve shillings the quarter,” says an ancient statute of       Henry III. “then wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings       and fourpence”. The proportion, however, between the shilling, and either       the penny on the one hand, or the pound on the other, seems not to have       been so constant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound.       During the first race of the kings of France, the French sou or shilling       appears upon different occasions to have contained five, twelve, twenty,       and forty pennies. Among the ancient Saxons, a shilling appears at one       time to have contained only five pennies, and it is not improbable that it       may have been as variable among them as among their neighbours, the       ancient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne among the French, and from       that of William the Conqueror among the English, the proportion between       the pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been uniformly the       same as at present, though the value of each has been very different; for       in every country of the world, I believe, the avarice and injustice of       princes and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects,       have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been       originally contained in their coins. The Roman as, in the latter ages of       the republic, was reduced to the twenty-fourth part of its original value,       and, instead of weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The       English pound and penny contain at present about a third only; the Scots       pound and penny about a thirty-sixth; and the French pound and penny about       a sixty-sixth part of their original value. By means of those operations,       the princes and sovereign states which performed them were enabled, in       appearance, to pay their debts and fulfil their engagements with a smaller       quantity of silver than would otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed       in appearance only; for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of       what was due to them. All other debtors in the state were allowed the same       privilege, and might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased       coin whatever they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore,       have always proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor,       and have sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the       fortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned by a very       great public calamity.            It is in this manner that money has become, in all civilized nations, the       universal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of       all kinds are bought and sold, or exchanged for one another.            What are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either       for money, or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules       determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.            The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and       sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes       the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object       conveys. The one may be called ‘value in use;’ the other, ‘value in       exchange.’ The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently       little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the       greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.       Nothing is more useful than water; but it will purchase scarce any thing;       scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the       contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other       goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.            In order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable       value of commodities, I shall endeavour to shew,            First, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein       consists the real price of all commodities.            Secondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is       composed or made up.            And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise       some or all of these different parts of price above, and sometimes sink       them below, their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes which       sometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price of       commodities, from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural       price.            I shall endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly as I can, those       three subjects in the three following chapters, for which I must very       earnestly entreat both the patience and attention of the reader: his       patience, in order to examine a detail which may, perhaps, in some places,       appear unnecessarily tedious; and his attention, in order to understand       what may perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of       giving it, appear still in some degree obscure. I am always willing to run       some hazard of being tedious, in order to be sure that I am perspicuous;       and, after taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some       obscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject, in its own nature       extremely abstracted.        CHAPTER V. OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY.              Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford       to enjoy the necessaries,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"],["title","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (#7)"],["body","encies, and amusements of human life. But       after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a       very small part of these with which a man’s own labour can supply him. The       far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people,       and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which       he can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any       commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to       use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is       equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or       command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value       of all commodities.            The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man       who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What       every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants       to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and       trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other       people. What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labour,       as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or       those goods, indeed, save us this toil. They contain the value of a       certain quantity of labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the       time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first       price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It was       not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world       was originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who       want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the       quantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase or command.            Wealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires,       or succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to       any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps,       afford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that       fortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which that       possession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of       purchasing a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce       of labour which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less,       precisely in proportion to the extent of this power, or to the quantity       either of other men’s labour, or, what is the same thing, of the produce       of other men’s labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The       exchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely equal to the       extent of this power which it conveys to its owner.            But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all       commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It       is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different       quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will       not always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of       hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into       account. There may be more labour in an hour’s hard work, than in two       hours easy business; or in an hour’s application to a trade which it cost       ten years labour to learn, than in a month’s industry, at an ordinary and       obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either       of hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions       of different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly       made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but       by the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of       rough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the       business of common life.            Every commodity, besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby       compared with, other commodities, than with labour. It is more natural,       therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some       other commodity, than by that of the labour which it can produce. The       greater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity       of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a       plain palpable object; the other an abstract notion, which though it can       be made sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and       obvious.            But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of       commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for       money than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom carries his beef or       his mutton to the baker or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread       or for beer; but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them       for money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread and for beer. The       quantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the quantity of       bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is more natural and       obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by the quantity of       money, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, than by that       of bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by       the intervention of another commodity; and rather to say that his       butcher’s meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, than that it is       worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of small       beer. Hence it comes to pass, that the exchangeable value of every       commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of money, than by       the quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had       in exchange for it.            Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value;       are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and       sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which any       particular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of       other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility       or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time when       such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of America,       reduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in Europe       to about a third of what it had been before. As it cost less labour to       bring those metals from the mine to the market, so, when they were brought       thither, they could purchase or command less labour; and this revolution       in their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the only one       of which history gives some account. But as a measure of quantity, such as       the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its       own quantity, can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of other       things; so a commodity which is itself continually varying in its own       value, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodities.       Equal quantities of labour, at all times and places, may be said to be of       equal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength,       and spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must       always lay down the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and his       happiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever may       be the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of these,       indeed, it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a smaller       quantity; but it is their value which varies, not that of the labour which       purchases them. At all times and places, that is dear which it is       difficult to come at, or which it costs much labour to acquire; and that       cheap which is to be had easily, or with very little labour. Labour alone,       therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real       standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places       be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal       price only.            But though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the       labourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of       greater, and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them sometimes with       a greater, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods, and to him the       price of labour seems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to       him dear in the one case, and cheap in the other. In reality, however, it       is the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other.            In this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be said to       have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be said to consist in       the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are given       for it; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The labourer is rich       or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the real, not to the       nominal price of his labour.            The distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and       labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be of       considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the same       value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver,       the same nominal price is sometimes of very different values."]]]
