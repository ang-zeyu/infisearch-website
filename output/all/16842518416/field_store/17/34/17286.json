[Footnote B: The bluejackets' name for knitted woollen gifts from friends on the beach.]  \"But the queerest thing was me hearing some guy lying all messed up on the deck muttering something about _skookum kluches_, and some more Chinook _wa-wa_ that I knew he couldn't have picked up anywhere else but from serving in a 'T.B.D.' working up and down the old Inland Passage from Vancouver Island. I felt my way to where he was huddled up in the wreck of a smashed gun, told him that I was another _tilicum_ from the 'Squimalt Base, and asked him what ship he had been there in. I knew there was a good chance that we'd been mates in the old _Virago_, and there even seemed a familiar sound to his voice. But I wasn't fated ever to find out. He just kept on muttering, slipping up on some words as if something was wrong with his mouth, and I didn't dare light a match, of course. When I tried to ease him up a bit by lifting so he'd lie straight--well, all of him didn't seem to come along when I started dragging by his shoulders. I never did find what was wrong with him, for right then new troubles of my own set in.  \"I was still down on my knees trying to locate what was missing with this poor guy, when--out of the corner of my eye, for it was near behind me--I spotted the flash of a ship challenging. _Bow_ challenged back--from somewhere aft--and then what I piped at once for a Hun destroyer switched on searchlights and opened fire. She was about two cables off on our port quarter, heading right for us and blazing away with one or two guns, probably all that would bear on that course. A second destroyer, right astern her, didn't seem to be firing. I heard the bang and saw the flash of two or three shells bursting somewhere amidships, and then the _Bow's_ port after gun began to reply. The crews of all the others were knocked out, and so were the searchlights.  \"Between the twenty-three from the _Seagull_ and what were left of the _Bow's_ fo'c'sl' guns' crews, there must have been thirty-five to forty men bunched together there for'rard of the wreck of the bridge. When the firing started, the whole kaboodle of us did what you're always under orders to do when you have nothing to stand up for--laid down. Or, rather, we just tumbled into a heap like a pile of dead rabbits.  \"I went sprawling over the poor devil I was trying to help, and there were two or three on top of me. Into that squirming hump of human flesh one of the Hun's projes landed kerplump. It didn't hit me at all, that one, but I can feel yet the kind of heave the whole bunch gave as it ploughed through. Then it was like warm water was being thrown on the pile in buckets, but it wasn't till I had scrambled out and found it sticky that I twigged it was blood.  \"Bad as it was, it might have been a lot worse. There hadn't been enough resistance to explode the proj, and so it killed only four or five and wounded, maybe, twice that, where it would have scoured every man jack of us into the sea and Kingdom Come if it had gone off. The next one found something in the wreck of the bridge hard enough to crack it off though, and it was a ragged scrap of its casing that drove in to the point of my hip and put a kink in my rolling gait that I've never quite shaken out yet. It wasn't much of a hurt to what it gave some, though, 'specially a lad that caught the main kick of it and got ditched to starboard, some of him going under the wire rail, and some over.  \"The Huns couldn't have known how down and out the _Bow_ really was, for there was nothing in the world but that one port gun to prevent their closing and polishing her off. The chances are they recognised her class, knew she was more than a match for the pair of them if she was right, and were glad to get off with no more'n an exchange of shots in passing. That was the end of the fighting for the _Bow_, and about time, too. Her bows were stove in, all the fore part of her was full of water, her bridge was smashed and useless, her W.T. and searchlights were finished, all but one gun was out of action, and--when they came to count noses next day--forty-two of her crew were dead. Far from looking for more trouble, it was now only a question of making harbour, and even that--as it turned out--was touch-and-go for two days.  \"It was about one in the morning when that brush with the destroyers came off, and after that there was nothing to do but hang on till daylight and they could clear a way to reach us from abaft the wreckage of the bridge. It was pretty awful, ticking off the minutes there in the darkness. A good many of the worst knocked about were talking a bit wild, but I never heard the guy with the Chinook _wa-wa_ again. He must have died and been pitched over while I was being bandaged up. I _did_ hear the 'wool-mat-maker' yapping again, though, saying how 'target cloth' was better to work on than canvas, and describing how to pull the stuff through in a loose loop, and then cut them so that they bunched up in 'soft, puffy balls.' Seems like I was cussing him when I dropped off to sleep.  \"I must have bled a good deal, for I slept like a log for four or five hours, and woke up only when some one turned me over and began to finger my hip. It was broad daylight, but hazy, and the sun just showing through. Some of the wounded had already been carried aft, and they were mostly dead ones that were lying around. These were being sewed up in canvas to get ready to bury. I thought there was something familiar in the face of one guy I saw them laying out and sort of collecting together, but it wasn't till later that it suddenly came to me that he was the one I had seen by firelight when he stood up and looked at himself where he'd been shot in two.  \"The two guys who bundled me up in a 'Neil Robertson' stretcher and packed me aft, picking their way over and through the wreckage, were both all bound up with rags, and so was about every one else I saw. They took me below into the wardroom, and then, because that was full up, on to some officer's cabin, where they found a place for me on the deck. After a while, a little dark guy--he was also a good deal bandaged, and so splashed with blood that I didn't notice at the time he was a sick bay steward--came in, washed my wound out with some dope that smarted like the devil, and tied it up. He worked like a streak of greased lightning, and then went on to some one else. That chap was Pridmore, and, let me tell you, he was the real 'top-liner' of all the heroes of the _Bow_. The surgeon had been killed at the first salvo the night before, leaving no one but him to carry on through all the hell that followed. And some way--God knows how--he did it; yes, even though he was wounded three or four times himself, and though he had to go without sleep for more'n two days to find time to dress and tend the thirty or forty crocks he had on his hands. He was sure the star turn, that Pridmore, and I was glad to read the other day that they had given him the D.S.M. Not that he'd have all he deserved if they hung medals all over him; but--well, a guy likes to have something to show that what he's done hasn't been lost in the shuffle entirely.\"  I made an entry of \"Pridmore, sick bay steward, _Bow_,\" in my notebook for future reference, and as I was returning it to my pocket a sudden list to starboard, accompanied by a throbbing grind of the helm, heralded a sharp alteration of course. Round she went through ten or twelve points, finally to steady and stand away on a course that seemed to lead toward the dip in the skyline between the jagged range of mountains back of Monastir and the point where a lowering bank of cirro-cumuli hid the ancient abode of the gods on the snow-capped summit of Olympus. On Number Two assuring me that his yarn was spun, that there was nothing more to it save an attempt he had made, in spite of his wound, to get into a fight that started when some of the wounded were hissed by a gang of dockyard \"mateys\"--I clambered back to the bridge to learn the significance of the new move. I still wanted to hear Gains' story of the _Killarney_, but I had already sized him up sufficiently to know that he was not the type of man who would unbosom himself before his mates. With him, I knew, I should have to watch my chances, and endeavour to have a yarn alone. Number Two's parting injunction was to \"try and have a go at Jock Campbell, 'the human proj.' Jock's the guy at the after gun that looks like he was rigged out for deep-sea diving,\" he said. \"Most likely he'll only growl at you at first, but if he won't warm up any other way, try him with a yarn about a skirt. He's 'verra fond o' a braw lass,' is Jock Campbell.\"  Our alteration of course, the captain told me, was the consequence of an order received by wireless directing him to cross over and hunt down a strip along the western shore of the gulf which was not being covered by the present formation of the division. \"I've had a signal stating that they're on the track of one U-boat, and there may be something to make them think another has slipped further along and is lying in ambush for the convoy about off Volo. They're evidently keeping the rest of the division heading in to meet the convoy itself.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The _Spark_ stood on to the north-west until the Vardar marshes showed as an olive-green rim around the bend of the gulf, before turning southward again to skirt the steep shingle-strewn beach along the alluvial \"fans\" spreading down to the sea from the base of Olympus. The wild-looking Thessalian shepherds were just driving their motley flocks down to the open foreshore to freshen up in the rising midday sea breeze, and it was when I assured Jock Campbell (where I found him leaning on the breech of the after gun and staring landwards with his bushy brows puckered in the incredulous scowl of a man who can't credit the evidence of his own eyes) that it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33438"],["title","Sea-Hounds (#4)"],["body","an actual fact that the fuzzy black sheep were wading in and drinking--if sparingly--of the salt water, that a basis of conversation was finally established. Up to that moment he had given no sign that any of my carelessly thrown out tentatives had penetrated to his ears through the \"telepad\" rig-out which established his connection with the gunnery control. But when, bringing my lips close to his nearest \"ear-muff,\" I shouted that I had come up along that coast from Lharissa but a few weeks previously by motor and pack-train, and that, in lieu of any fresh water for many miles in either direction, I had actually seen the sheep and goats drinking in flocks from the sea, the look of hostile suspicion in his eyes was replaced by one of friendly interest.  \"Weel, weel, y'u dinna say so?\" he ejaculated, easing away the edge of the helmet over one ear; \"the puir wee beasties!\" Then he volunteered that he had once kept from freezing to death in a snowstorm on Ben Nevis by curling up among his sheep, and I told how I had once sheared sheep (not mentioning it was for only half a day, and that my \"clip\" was composed of about equal parts mutton and wool) on a back blocks station in Queensland. Then he described how he had seen a big merino ram butt a Ford car off the road up Thurso way, and I--with more finesse than veracity--capped that with a yarn of how I had seen a flock of Macedonian sheep blown up by a Bulgarian air-bomb, and how one of them had landed unhurt upon a passing motor lorry load of forage--and gone right on grazing! I reckoned that might be calculated to remind Jock of something of the same character which had befallen him on a certain memorable occasion, and I was not disappointed.  \"'Twas verra like wha' cam ma way on the nicht the _Bow_ rammed the _Seagull_ at the fecht aff Jutland,\" he commented instantly, with no trace of suspicion in his voice. \"Wad ye care to hear aboot it? Ye wud? Weel, then----.\" As brief, as direct and to the point was the plain unvarnished tale Jock Campbell told me the while a noon-day storm awoke reverberant echoes of the Jovian thunders in the snow-caverns of Olympus and the _Spark_ hunted down through the jade green waters of the Thessalian coast for a U-boat that was supposed to be lurking in their lucent depths \"somewhere off Volo.\"  \"Ah was at ma action station at the port foremost gun,\" he began, wiping his perspiring brow with a wad of greasy waste, which left an undulant trail of oil from the recoil cylinder in its wake, \"when we gaed bang into a line o' big Hun cru'sers, and we lat blaze at them and them at us. The range was short, and wi' their serchlichts lichten us up oor position wasna that Ah wad ca' verra pleasant. Up gaed a Hun cru'ser in a spoort o' flame and reek, hit, Ah thocht, by a mouldie launched by oor next astern. Ah was fair jumpin' wi' joy at the sicht, when a hale salvo o' screechin' projes cam bang inta the fo'c'sl. Ah minded the licht o' them mair than the soun', which was na great.  \"The Huns had switched aff their serchlichts when they opened fire, so that noo the projes was bursting in inky mirk. I doubtna oor midships and after guns was firing, but na the foremost, for Ah dinna mind being blinded by their licht afore the Hun projes gan bursting. My ain gun wudna bear on the Huns, so Ah was just standing by for the time, ready to train if we turned.  \"Twa salvos cam--maybe frae twa different cru'sers--ane after the ither, wi' aboot half a meenit atween. Ye ken that the licht o' a shell-burst is ower afore ye can even think, and a' the furst ane showed me was just the gun crews, standin', and bracin' themsel's like when a big sea braks inboard. It was ower like a flash o' lichtnin, and the licht had gone oot afore Ah saw anybody blown up or knocked oot. But Ah felt a michty blast o' air and an awfu' shaikin o' the deck, and then the bang o' lumps o' projes dingin' 'gainst the bridge and smackin' through bodies.  \"The flash o' the burst o' the second salvo tellt me what havoc the first had wrocht, but by noo ma een was licht-blind and Ah cudna see weel. The sta'bo'd gun was twisht oot o' shape, and a' the crew but ane were strechit on the deck. To a' appearance that lad had been laid oot wi' the ithers, but noo he was puin himsel' to his feet and crawlin' up the wreck o' the gun when a proj frae the second salvo burst richt alow him. By the flash Ah saw him flyin' inta the air, and--by the licht o' anither flash a bittie efter--then his corp, wi' twa or three ithers, gang ower the side. A lump o' that last proj carried awa' the Number Wan o' ma ain gun, and, onlike some o' the ithers, not a bit o' him was left ahint. Ah mesel' was knockit flat, but wasna much the worse for a' that.  \"That was the hinmost Ah saw o' the Huns for that nicht, and the last I mind o' the _Bow_ was the dead and deein' wha covert the fo'c'sl', wi' the licht o' the fires burnin' aft flickerin' ower them. Then cam' a cry frae the bridge that a 'stroyer was closin' us to port, and then Ah mind hearin' the captain shoutin' an order ower and ower, like he wasna bein' answered frae the ither end o' the voice-pipe. 'Hard-a-port!' he roared, but weel micht he shout for ay, for the qua'termaster, wi' a' on the signal bridge, was dead by noo, and the helm was left jammed hard-a-sta'bo'd.  \"Then Ah felt her shudder as the engines went full speed astern, and Ah got to ma feet in time to see she was headin' straicht for the fo'c'sl' o' a T.B.D. that was steerin' cross her bows. And richt after that she must ha' struck wi' a michty crash. The next thing Ah mindit--weel, Ah didna mind much save that I was lyin' on ma back in a sort o' narrow way atween twa high wa's, wi' a turrible pain in ma back and mony sea-boots trampin' ower ma face. The bashin' o' the boots didna hurt me, for Ah was kind o' dazed; but Ah seem to mind turnin' ma face to the wa', just like ye do whan the flees are botherin' ye in the mornin'.  \"What brocht me roun', I'm thinkin', was the shock that Ah got whan that wa' 'gan to shak' up and doon, and then slid richt awa', leavin' me hingin' ower the brink o' a black hole, wi' water souchin' aboot the bottom o't. 'Twas like wakin' oot o' a bad dream and findin' that the warst o' it was true.  \"Ah was too groggy to ken richt awa' that the _Bow_ had rammed anither ship and that Ah had been pitched oot o' her into the wan she'd hit. Quite natteral, Ah thocht masel' still in the _Bow_, seem' that Ah cud be nae mair use on the fo'c'sl', which was a' smashed and rippit up and drappin' to bits, Ah thocht that Ah ought to run aft to see if Ah could gie a haun.  \"But when Ah tried to get up, Ah fund the bane o' ma spine was so sair that Ah cudna stand straicht, and a' Ah cud do was to craw' and stagger alang. Every mon Ah knockit agin, and every bit of wreck Ah felt ower, sent me sprawlin'. Whan I fund that there was no so mony funnels as Ah minded afore, and whan Ah cudna find the W.T. hoose, Ah thocht that they had been shot awa'. Findin' a crew at stations by a midships gun, Ah speired if they was short o' hauns. They said they werna, so Ah gaed alang aft, lookin' for a chance to be useful.  \"Ah was thinkin' to masel', 'she's awfu' little shot up' (for ye ken Ah had expectit her to be a' to bits frae the way Ah'd heard the projes burstin' ahint the bridge), whan a syren gae a michty shriek a' most at ma lug, and Ah turned to see anither T.B.D., spootin' fire frae her funnels and throwin' a double bow wave higher'n her fo'c'sl', headin' richt inta us. Ah cud see that her helm was hard-a-port by the way her wake was boilin', but it was nae guid. She turned enough to keep frae rammin' us midships, but she cudna miss oor stern.  \"Ah had just been tellt by ane o' the after gun's crew to get oot o' the wa' (they not bein' short o' hauns), whan this new craft hove inta sicht. At first it lookit like she wad cut thro' for'ard o' me, leavin' me ahint to drown in the wreck o' the stern. Then Ah thocht she was comin' richt at me, and Ah started crawlin' back to whaur Ah had come frae. But she keepit turnin' and turnin', so that she hit at last richt abaft the after gun. Ah fell a' in a heap at the shock, and, tho' Ah was a guid ten feet frae whaur her stem cut in, the bulge o' her crunched into the quarterdeck till she passed sae close that suthin' stickin' oot frae her side--it micht hae been the lip o' a mouldie-tube, Ah'm thinkin'--gae ma puir back a sair dig, and there Ah was amang the mess left o' the gun and its crew. Ah was near to bein' dragged owerboard after that T.B.D., and when she was gone Ah fund masel'--for the second time in ane night--hangin' ower the raggit edge o' a black hole listenin' to the swish o' ragin' waters.  \"And then, gin that and ma half-broken back werna enough for ony mon, Ah hear some ane shoutit that they thocht that last rammin' had done in the auld _Seagull_, and that the time wad soon come to 'bandon ship.  \"'_Seagull!_' says Ah; 'dinna ye ken this ship is the _Bow_?' Ah kind o' went groggy after that, and Ah have a sort o' dim remembrance that some ane flashit an 'lectric torch in ma face and said that Ah must have been pitchit ower whan the _Bow_ rammed the _Seagull_, and that Ah prob'ly hadna shaken doon to ma new surroundin's. Ah tried hard to speir what kind o' a shakin' doon they meant gin this hadna been ane. But Ah didna seem to have the power to mak' ma words come straicht, and they said, 'He's gane a bit off his chuck,' and ca'd some ane to carry me below.  \"The pains runnin' up and doon ma spine when Ah was lowered doon the ladder were ower much for me, and Ah passed off for a bit.
