Crystals in the form of cubes. Heated in an ignition tube it sometimes decrepitates and yields a sublimate of sulphur. Before the Bp. on Ch. easily reduced to the metallic state, the Ch. becoming coated with sulphate and oxide of lead. The metallic globule usually contains a little silver. To separate this, the process known as \"cupellation\" is employed. A hole is bored into the Ch. about 1 cm. in diameter and about 6 mm. deep. Into this hole is placed a stiff paste made by mixing finely pulverized bone-ash with a little soda and water. This paste is pressed in hard, and then the surface is smoothed off, and the centre is slightly depressed with the rounded end of a glass rod. The charcoal so prepared is set in a warm place to allow the paste to dry. When the paste is quite dry the small globule of lead is placed in the depression in the centre of the bone-ash \"cupel,\" and is there exposed to the O. F. from the Bp. The lead is oxidized and is absorbed by the bone-ash, while any silver present will remain in the central depression as a bright shining bead.   ~Cerusite~, PbCO_{3}, PbO . 84, CO_{2} . 16.--H = 3.0-3.5, G = 6.46-6.57.
