And, Johnny--there used to be country schools with no more than five pupils....\"  \"Sure,\" John Endlich said.  Something felt warm around his heart. Leave it to a woman to think of a school--the symbol of civilization, marching now across the void. John Endlich thought of the trouble at the mining camp, which his first load of fresh vegetables, picked up by a small space boat, had perhaps helped to end. He thought of the relics in this strange land. Things that were like legends of a lost pastoral beauty. Things that could come back. The second family of homesteaders was almost here. Endlich was reconciled to domesticity. He felt at home; he felt proud.  Bees buzzed near him. A tay-tay bug from a perished era, hummed and scraped out a mournful sound.  \"I wonder if the Harper kids'll call you Mr. Pun'kins, Pop,\" Bubs remarked. \"Like the miners still do.\"  John Endlich laughed. But somehow he was prouder than ever. Maybe the name would be a legend, too."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3279"],["title","Canterbury Pieces (#0)"],["body","from the 1914 A. C.

(Private).      _Mr. Darwin takes the liberty to send by this post to the Editor a     New Zealand newspaper for the very improbable chance of the Editor     having some spare space to reprint a Dialogue on Species_.  _This     Dialogue_, _written by some_ [_sic_] _quite unknown to Mr. Darwin_,     _is remarkable from its spirit and from giving so clear and accurate     a view of Mr. D._ [_sic_] _theory_.  _It is also remarkable from     being published in a colony exactly_ 12 _years old_, _in which it     might have_ [_sic_] _thought only material interests would have been     regarded_.  _The autograph of this letter was purchased from Mr. Tregaskis by Mr. Festing Jones_, _and subsequently presented by him to the Museum at Christ Church_.  _The letter cannot be dated with certainty_, _but since Butler’s dialogue was published in December_, 1862, _and it is at least probable that the copy of the_ PRESS _which contained it was sent to Darwin shortly after it appeared_, _we may conclude with tolerable certainty that the letter was written in March_, 1863.  _Further light is thrown on the controversy by a correspondence which took place between Butler and Darwin in_ 1865, _shortly after Butler’s return to England_. _During that year Butler had published a pamphlet entitled_ THE EVIDENCE FOR THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST AS GIVEN BY THE FOUR EVANGELISTS CRITICALLY EXAMINED, _of which he afterwards incorporated the substance into_ THE FAIR HAVEN.  _Butler sent a copy of this pamphlet to Darwin_, _and in due course received the following reply_:—                                                  _Down_, _Bromley_, _Kent_.                                                     _September_ 30 [1865].      _My dear Sir_,—_I am much obliged to you for so kindly sending me     your Evidences_, _etc._  _We have read it with much interest_.  _It     seems to me written with much force_, _vigour_, _and clearness_; _and     the main argument to me is quite new_.  _I particularly agree with     all you say in your preface_.      _I do not know whether you intend to return to New Zealand_, _and_,     _if you are inclined to write_, _I should much like to know what your     future plans are_.      _My health has been so bad during the last five months that I have     been confined to my bedroom_.  _Had it been otherwise I would have     asked you if you could have spared the time to have paid us a visit_;     _but this at present is impossible_, _and I fear will be so for some     time_.      _With my best thanks for your present_,      _I remain_,                                  _My dear Sir_,                                                    _Yours very faithfully_,                                                          _Charles Darwin_.  _To this letter Butler replied as follows_:—                                                 15 _Clifford’s Inn_, _E.C._                                                     _October_ 1_st_, 1865.      _Dear Sir_,—_I knew you were ill and I never meant to give you the     fatigue of writing to me_.  _Please do not trouble yourself to do so     again_.  _As you kindly ask my plans I may say that_, _though I very     probably may return to New Zealand in three or four years_, _I have     no intention of doing so before that time_.  _My study is art_, _and     anything else I may indulge in is only by-play_; _it may cause you     some little wonder that at my age I should have started as an art     student_, _and I may perhaps be permitted to explain that this was     always my wish for years_, _that I had begun six years ago_, _as soon     as ever I found that I could not conscientiously take orders_; _my     father so strongly disapproved of the idea that I gave it up and went     out to New Zealand_, _stayed there for five years_, _worked like a     common servant_, _though on a run of my own_, _and sold out little     more than a year ago_, _thinking that prices were going to     fall_—_which they have since done_.  _Being then rather at a loss     what to do and my capital being all locked up_, _I took the     opportunity to return to my old plan_, _and have been studying for     the last ten years unremittingly_.  _I hope that in three or four     years more I shall be able to go on very well by myself_, _and then I     may go back to New Zealand or no as circumstances shall seem to     render advisable_.  _I must apologise for so much detail_, _but     hardly knew how to explain myself without it_.      _I always delighted in your_ ORIGIN OF SPECIES _as soon as I saw it     out in New Zealand_—_not as knowing anything whatsoever of natural     history_, _but it enters into so many deeply interesting questions_,     _or rather it suggests so many_, _that it thoroughly fascinated me_.     _I therefore feel all the greater pleasure that my pamphlet should     please you_, _however full of errors_.      _The first dialogue on the_ ORIGIN _which I wrote in the_ PRESS     _called forth a contemptuous rejoinder from_ (_I believe_) _the     Bishop of Wellington_—(_please do not mention the name_, _though I     think that at this distance of space and time I might mention it to     yourself_) _I answered it with the enclosed_, _which may amuse you_.     _I assumed another character because my dialogue was in my hearing     very severely criticised by two or three whose opinion I thought     worth having_, _and I deferred to their judgment in my next_.  _I do     not think I should do so now_.  _I fear you will be shocked at an     appeal to the periodicals mentioned in my letter_, _but they form a     very staple article of bush diet_, _and we used to get a good deal of     superficial knowledge out of them_.  _I feared to go in too heavy on     the side of the_ ORIGIN, _because I thought that_, _having said my     say as well as I could_, _I had better now take a less impassioned     tone_; _but I was really exceedingly angry_.      _Please do not trouble yourself to answer this_, _and believe me_,                           _Yours most sincerely_,                                                                _S. Butler_.  _This elicited a second letter from Darwin_:—                                                  _Down_, _Bromley_, _Kent_.                                                               _October_ 6.      _My dear Sir_,—_I thank you sincerely for your kind and frank     letter_, _which has interested me greatly_.  _What a singular and     varied career you have already run_.  _Did you keep any journal or     notes in New Zealand_?  _For it strikes me that with your rare powers     of writing you might make a very interesting work descriptive of a     colonist’s life in New Zealand_.      _I return your printed letter_, _which you"]]]
