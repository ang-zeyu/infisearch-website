He'd just had his first big break, and it might turn out to be the only one he needed. On an impulse, he had decided to strike out directly for the spaceport. He had done so, and now stood on the dark tarmac between the manifest shed and the pilot-barracks. And, not ten minutes after he had reached the spacefield a cordon of guards rushed there from Interstelpen had been stationed around the field. Had Bartock arrived just a few minutes later, he would have been too late, his capture only a matter of time. As it was now, though, he had a very good chance of getting away. Circumstances were in his favor.  He could get so far away that they would never find him.  It was simple. Get off Triton on a spaceship. Go anyplace that had a big spaceport, and manage to tranship out in secret. Then all the police would have to search would be a few quadrillion square miles of space!  But first he had to leave Triton.  From the activity at the port, he could see that three ships were being made ready for blastoff. Two of them were purely cargo-carriers, but the third--Bartock could tell because he saw hand-luggage being loaded--would carry passengers. His instinct for survival must have been working overtime: he knew that the third ship would be his best bet, for if he were discovered and pursued, hostages might make the difference between recapture and freedom.  Bartock waited patiently in the darkness outside the pilot-barracks. The only problem was, how to discover which pilot belonged to which ship?  The cordon of police from Interstelpen had set up several score arc-lights on the perimeter of the field. The spaces between the lights were patrolled by guards armed, as Bartock was, with blasters. Bartock could never have made it through that cordon now. But it wasn't necessary. He was already inside.  The barracks door opened, and a pilot came out. Tensing, ready, Bartock watched him.  The three ships were scattered widely on the field, _Venus Bell_ to the north, _Star of Hercules_ to the south, _Mozart's Lady_ to the east. _Venus Bell_ and _Star of Hercules_ were straight cargo carriers. _Mozart's Lady_--what a queer name for a spaceship, Bartock couldn't help thinking--had taken in hand luggage. So if the pilot who had just left the barracks headed east, Bartock would take him. The pilot paused outside, lit a cigarette, hummed a tune. The scent of tobacco drifted over to Bartock. He waited.  The pilot walked east toward _Mozart's Lady_.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Ready, girls?\"  \"Ready, Mrs. Moriarity. But couldn't we--well--sort of hang around until we see what happens?\"  \"You mean the escaped convict?\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\" Hopefully.  \"They'll catch him. They always catch them.\"  \"But--\"  \"Come on.\"  \"Aw, gosh, Mrs. Moriarity.\"  \"I said, come on.\"  Reluctantly, the hundred girls trooped with their chaperone from the hotel.         *       *       *       *       *  Bartock struck swiftly and without mercy.  The blaster would make too much noise. He turned it around, held it by the barrel, and broke the pilot's skull with it. In the darkness he changed clothing for the second time that night, quickly, confidently, his hands steady. In the darkness he could barely make out the pilot's manifest. The man's ship was _Mozart's Lady_, all right. Outbound from Triton City for Mars. Well, Bartock thought, he wouldn't go to Mars. Assuming they learned what ship he had boarded, they would be guarding the inner orbits too closely.  He would take _Mozart's Lady_ daringly outward, beyond Neptune's orbit. Naturally, the ship wouldn't have interstellar drive, but as yet Bartock wasn't going interstellar. You couldn't have everything. You couldn't expect a starship on Triton, could you? So Bartock would take _Mozart's Lady_ outward to Pluto's orbit--and wait. From the amount of hand luggage taken aboard, _Mozart's Lady_ would be carrying quite a number of passengers. If that number were reduced--drastically reduced--the food, water and air aboard would last for many months. Until the fuss died down. Until Bartock could bring _Mozart's Lady_, long since given up for lost, in for a landing on one of the inner planets....  Now he dragged the dead pilot's body into the complete darkness on the south side of the pilot-barracks, wishing he could hide it better but knowing he didn't have the time or the means.  Then he walked boldly across the tarmac, wearing a pilot's uniform, toward _Mozart's Lady_.  Fifteen minutes later, House Bartock watched with amazement while a hundred pretty young women boarded the ship. Of all the things that had happened since his escape, this came closest to unnerving him, for it was the totally unexpected. Bartock shrugged, chain-smoked three cigarettes while the women boarded slowly, taking last-minute looks at dark Triton, the spaceport, the cordon of guards, the arc-lights. Bartock cursed impotently. Seconds were precious now. The pilot's body might be found. If it were....  At last the port clanged shut and the ground-crew tromped away. Since even an over-age ship like _Mozart's Lady_ was close to ninety percent automatic, there was no crew. Only the pilot--who was Bartock--and the passengers.  Bartock was about to set the controls for blastoff when he heard footsteps clomp-clomping down the companionway. He toyed with the idea of locking the door, then realized that would arouse suspicion.  A square woman's face over a plump middle-aged figure.  \"I'm Mrs. Moriarity, pilot. I have a hundred young girls aboard. We'll have no nonsense.\"  \"No, sir. I mean, no ma'am.\"  \"Well, make sure.\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"And I want an easy trip, without fuss or incidents. For half of our girls it's the second time in space--the first being when they came out here. You understand?\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"What happened to the pilot who took us out?\"  \"Uh, pressed into service last week on a Mercury run. I'm surprised the control board didn't tell you.\"  \"They didn't. It doesn't matter. You do your job, and that's all.\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" House Bartock said. \"Just my job.\"  A few moments later, _Mozart's Lady_ blasted off.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Stop! Hey, wait!\" Pitchblend Hardesty bawled at the top of his voice. But it didn't do any good. The police rushed up behind Pitchblend, not daring to fire.  Moments before, they had found the dead pilot's body.  They knew at once what it meant, of course. They had been not more than a minute too late.  \"Call Central Control on Neptune,\" a police officer said. \"We'll send a cruiser after them.\"  \"Won't do any good,\" Pitchblend Hardesty groaned.  \"What are you talking about, fellow?\"  \"Unless the cruiser's brand new.\"  \"On Neptune? Don't be silly. Newest one we've got is ten years old.\"  \"Like I said, won't do any good. I worked that ship over, mister. I know what she's like inside. She may look like an over-age tub on the outside, but don't let that fool you. She's got power, mister. She's probably the fastest thing this side of the Jovian moons, except for those experimental one-man rocket-bombs down at Neptune Station. But chasing a big tub in a one-man space-bound coffin--\" here Pitchblend used the vernacular for the tiny one-man experimental ships--\"ain't going to do anybody any good. Best thing you can do is track _Mozart's Lady_ by radar and hope she'll head sunward. Then they could intercept her closer in.\"  But _Mozart's Lady_ did not head sunward. Radar tracking confirmed this moments later. _Mozart's Lady_ was outward bound for Pluto's orbit. And, with Pluto and Neptune currently in conjunction, that could even mean a landing, although, the police decided, that wasn't likely. There were no settlements on Pluto. Pluto was too weird. For the strangest reason in a solar system and a galaxy of wonders, Pluto was quite uninhabitable. More likely, _Mozart's Lady_ would follow Pluto's orbit around, then make a dash sunward....  The radar officer threw up his hands. \"I give up,\" he said. \"She's heading for Pluto's orb all right. Call Neptune Station.\"  \"Neptune Station, sir?\"  \"You bet. This job's too big for me. The brass will want to handle it.\"  Seconds later, sub-space crackled with energy as the call was put through from Triton City to Neptune Station.         *       *       *       *       *  Whatever else history would write about him, it would certainly call Johnny Mayhem the strangest--and literally most death-defying--test-pilot in history. Of course, testing the sleek experimental beauties out of Neptune Station and elsewhere wasn't Mayhem's chief occupation. He was, in a phrase, a trouble-shooter for the Galactic League. Whenever he had a spare few weeks, having completed an assignment ahead of schedule in his latest of bodies, he was likely to turn up at some testing station or other and volunteer for work. He was never turned down, although the Galactic League didn't approve. Mayhem was probably the galaxy's best pilot, with incredible reflexes and an utter indifference toward death.  For the past two weeks, having completed what turned out to be an easier-than-expected assignment on Neptune, he had been piloting the space-bound coffins out of Neptune Station, and with very satisfactory experimental results.  A few minutes ago he had been called into the station director's office, but when he entered he was surprised to see the Galactic League Firstman of Neptune waiting for him.  \"Surprised, eh?\" the Firstman demanded.  \"I'll bet you want me to quit test-flying,\" Mayhem said with a smile which, clearer than words, told the Firstman his advice would be rejected.  The Firstman smiled too, \"Why, no, Mayhem. As a matter of fact, I want you to take one of the coffins into deep space.\"  \"Maybe something's wrong with my hearing,\" Mayhem said.  \"No. You heard it right. Of course, it's up to you. Everything you do, you volunteer.\"  \"Let's hear it, Firstman.\"  So the Firstman of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32820"],["title","World Beyond Pluto (#2)"],["body","told Johnny Mayhem about _Mozart's Lady_ which, six hours ago, had left Triton for Pluto's orbit with an eccentric wealthy widow, a hundred girls, and a desperate escaped killer.  \"The only thing we have out here fast enough to overtake them, Mayhem, is the one-man coffins. The only man we have who can fly them is you. What do you say?\"  Mayhem's answer was a question, but the question didn't really require an answer. Mayhem asked: \"What are we waiting for?\"  The Firstman grinned. He had expected such an answer, of course. The whole galaxy, let alone the solar system, knew the Mayhem legend. Every world which had an Earthman population and a Galactic League post, however small, had a body in cold storage, waiting for Johnny Mayhem if his services were required. But of course no one knew precisely when Mayhem's services might be required. No one knew exactly under what circumstances the Galactic League Council, operating from the hub of the Galaxy, might summon Mayhem. And only a very few people, including those at the Hub and the Galactic League Firstmen on civilized worlds and Observers on primitive worlds, knew the precise mechanics of Mayhem's coming.  Johnny Mayhem, a bodiless sentience. Mayhem--Johnny Marlow, then--who had been chased from Earth, a pariah and a criminal, eight years ago, who had been mortally wounded on a wild planet deep within the Saggitarian Swarm, whose life had been saved--after a fashion--by the white magic of that planet. Mayhem, doomed now to possible immortality as a bodiless sentience, an _elan_, which could occupy and activate a corpse if it had been frozen properly ... an _elan_ doomed to wander eternally because it could not remain in one body for more than a month without body and _elan_ perishing. Mayhem, who had dedicated his strange, lonely life to the service of the Galactic League because a normal life and normal social relations were not possible for him....  \"One thing, Mayhem,\" the Firstman said, now, on Neptune. \"How much longer you have in that body of yours?\"  \"Five days. Possibly six.\"  \"That doesn't give you much time. If you're caught out there when your month is up--\"  \"I won't be. We're wasting time talking about it.\"  \"--it would mean your death.\"  \"Then let's get started.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Firstman stared at him levelly. \"You're a brave man, Mayhem.\"  \"Let's say I'm not afraid to die. I've been a living dead man for eight years. Come on.\"  One of the so-called coffins, a tiny one-man ship barely big enough for a prone man, food concentrates and water, was already waiting at the station spacefield.  Ten minutes after hearing about _Mozart's Lady_, without fanfare, Mayhem blasted off in pursuit.         *       *       *       *       *  Maintaining top speed all the way, House Bartock brought _Mozart's Lady_ across almost two billion miles of space from Neptune's to Pluto's orbit in three days. He was delighted with the speed. It would have taken the average space-tub ten days to two weeks and, since as far as Bartock knew there were nothing but average space-tubs on Neptune, that gave him a considerable head-start.  It was Jane Cummings-First Violin who discovered Bartock's identity. Bartock was studying the star-map at the time and considered himself safe from discovery because he kept the control door of _Mozart's Lady_ locked. However, Jane Cummings had established something of a liaison with the pilot outward bound from Earth and Mars, so she had been given a spare key which she'd kept, secretly, all the time the symphony was on Triton. Now, curious about the new pilot for the same reason that the miners on Triton had been curious about the symphony, Jane made her way forward, inserted her key in the lock, and pushed open the control door.  \"Hello there,\" she said.  House Bartock whirled. The turning of a key in the lock had so unnerved him--it was the last thing he expected--that he forgot to shut off the star-map. Its tell-tale evidence glowed on the wall over his head.  \"What do you want?\" he managed to ask politely.  \"Oh, just to say hello.\"  \"You already said it.\"  Jane Cummings pouted. \"You needn't bite my head off. What's your name? Mine's Jane, and I play the violin. It wouldn't hurt you to be polite.\"  Bartock nodded, deciding that a little small talk wouldn't hurt if he could keep the girl from becoming suspicious. That was suddenly important. If this girl had a key to the control room, for all he knew there could be others.  \"My, you have been hurrying,\" Jane said. \"I could tell by the acceleration. You must be trying to break the speed records or something. I'll bet we're almost to Earth--\"  Her voice trailed off and her mouth hung open. At first Bartock didn't know what was the matter. Then he saw where she was staring.  The star-map.  \"We're not heading for Earth!\" she cried.  Bartock walked toward her. \"Give me that key,\" he said. \"You're going to have to stay here with me. Give me that key.\"  Jane backed away. \"You--you couldn't be our pilot. If you were--\"  \"The key. I don't want to hurt you.\"  Bartock lunged. Jane turned and ran, slamming the door behind her. It clanged, and echoed. The echo didn't stop. Bartock, on the point of opening the door and sprinting down the companionway after her, stopped.  It wasn't the echo of metal slamming against metal. It was the radar warning.  Either _Mozart's Lady_ was within dangerous proximity of a meteor, or a ship was following them.  Bartock ran to the radar screen.  The pip was unmistakable. A ship was following them.  A ship as fast--or faster--than _Mozart's Lady_.  Cursing, Bartock did things with the controls. _Mozart's Lady_, already straining, increased its speed. Acceleration flung Bartock back in the pilot's chair. Pluto loomed dead ahead.         *       *       *       *       *  Johnny Mayhem knew at what precise moment he had been discovered, for suddenly the speed of _Mozart's Lady_ increased. Since this had occurred an hour and a half after Mayhem had first got a clear pip of the bigger ship on his radar, it meant he'd been spotted.  Prone with his hands stretched forward in the coffin-like experimental ship, Mayhem worked the controls, exactly matching speed with _Mozart's Lady_.  He tried to put himself in the position of the escaped convict. What would he do? His best bet would be to swing in close around Pluto, as close as he dared. Then, on the dark side of the planet, to change his orbit abruptly and come loose of its gravitational field in a new direction. It was a dangerous maneuver, but since the escaped convict now knew for sure that the tiny ship could match the speed of _Mozart's Lady_, it was his only hope. The danger was grave: even a first-rate pilot would try it only as a last resort, for the gravitational pull of Pluto might upset _Mozart's Lady_'s orbit. If that happened, the best the convict could hope for was an emergency landing. More likely, a death-crash would result.  Seconds later, Mayhem's thinking was confirmed. _Mozart's Lady_ executed a sharp turn in space and disappeared behind the white bulk of Pluto.  Mayhem swore and followed.  \"He's trying to kill us all!\"  \"He doesn't know how to pilot a ship! We're helpless, helpless!\"  \"Do something, Mrs. Moriarity!\"  \"Now girls, whatever happens, you must keep calm. We can only assume that Jane was right about what she saw, but since none of us can pilot a spaceship, we'll have to bide our time....\"  \"Bide our time!\"  \"We're all as good as dead!\"  One of the girls began screaming.  Mrs. Moriarity slapped her. \"I'm sorry, dear. I had to hit you. Your behavior bordered on the hysterical. And if we become hysterical we are lost, lost, do you understand?\"  \"Yes'm.\"  \"Good. Then we wait and see what happens.\"         *       *       *       *       *  What was happening was an attempt at what test-pilots term planet-swinging. Moving in the direction of Pluto's orbit, _Mozart's Lady_ swung in very close behind the planet. Then, as the rotation of Pluto on its axis hurled it forth again, as a sling-shot hurls a pellet, _Mozart's Lady_'s rockets would alter the expected direction of flight. Unless a pursuing ship followed exactly the same maneuver, it would be flung off into space at top-speed in the wrong direction. It might be hours before the first ship's trail could be picked up again--if ever.  House Bartock, aware of all this--and one other factor--sat sweating it out at the controls.  The one other factor was closeness to Pluto. For if you got too close, and the difference was only a matter of miles covered in an elapsed time of mili-seconds, Pluto might drag you into a landing orbit. If that happened, traveling at tremendous speed, there'd be the double danger of overheating in the planet's atmosphere and coming down too hard. Either way the results could be fatal.  His hands sweating, Bartock struggled with the controls. Now already he could see Pluto bulking, its night-side black and mysterious, in the viewport. Now he could hear the faint shrill scream of its atmosphere. Now....  Trying to time it perfectly, he slammed on full power.  A fraction of a mili-second too late.  _Mozart's Lady_ stood for an instant on its tail, shuddering as if it were going to come apart and rain meteoric dust over Pluto's surface. That had happened too in such a maneuver, but it didn't happen now.  Instead, _Mozart's Lady_ went into a landing orbit.  But its speed was still terrific and, lowering, it whizzed twice around Pluto's fifteen thousand mile circumference in twenty minutes. Atmosphere screamed, the heat siren shrilled, and a cursing House Bartock applied the braking rockets as fast as he could.  Pluto's surface blurred in the viewport, coming closer at dizzying speed. Bartock stood _Mozart's Lady_ on its tail a second time, this time on purpose.  The ship shuddered, and struck Pluto.  Bartock blacked out.         *       *       *       *       *  When Mayhem's radar screen"]]]
