C. Cooke's grouping of the spore series is adopted.     ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD \"MUSHROOM.\"   Various opinions have been offered as to the derivation of the word \"mushroom.\" According to Hay, it probably had its origin in a combination of the two Welsh words _maes_, a field, and _rhum_, a knob, which by gradual corruption have become _mushroom_. Some writers on the other hand regard it as a corruption of _mousseron_, a name specifically applied by the French to those mushrooms which are found growing in mossy places. But it seems to be of older usage than such a derivation would imply, and therefore the first explanation seems the more likely to be correct.  In England the term \"mushroom\" has been most commonly applied to the \"meadow mushroom,\" that being the one best known; but English-speaking mycologists now apply it generically very much as the French do the term \"champignon,\" while the name \"champignon\" is restricted in England to the Marasmius oreades, or \"Fairy Ring\" mushroom.  Berkeley says the French word \"champignon\" was originally scarcely of wider signification than our word \"mushroom,\" though now classical in the sense of fleshy fungi generally. The German word _Pilz_ (a corruption of Boletus) is used to denote the softer kinds by some German authors. Constant and Dufour, in their recently published Atlas des Champignons, include types of a great variety of mushrooms.  Hay contends that the pernicious nick-name \"toad-stool\" has not the derivation supposed, but that the first part of the word is the Saxon or old English \"tod,\" meaning a bunch, cluster, or bush, the form of many terrestrial fungi suggesting it. The second syllable, \"stool,\" is easily supplied. \"The erroneous idea of connecting toads with these plants,\" says Hay, \"seems to be due to Spenser, or to some poet, possibly, before his time.\" Spenser speaks of the loathed paddocks, \"paddock\" then being the name given in England to the frog, afterwards corrupted to \"paddic,\" and once received, readily converted by the Scotch into \"puddick-stool.\" It would seem, therefore, from the foregoing, that the term \"toad-stool\" can have no proper relation to mushrooms, whether edible or poisonous.  The three mushrooms illustrated and described in this pamphlet, Plates I, II, and III, are of the order Agaricini or gilled mushrooms. They are well-defined types and of wide geographical distribution.     FOOD VALUE OF MUSHROOMS.   Rollrausch and Siegel, who claim to have made exhaustive investigations into the food values of mushrooms, state that \"many species deserve to be placed beside meat as sources of nitrogenous nutriment,\" and their analysis, if correct, fully bears out the statement. They find in 100 parts of dried _Morchella esculenta_ 35.18 per cent. of protein; in _Helvella esculenta_, 26.31 per cent. of protein, from 46 to 49 per cent. of potassium salts and phosphoric acid, 2.3 per cent. of fatty matter, and a considerable quantity of sugar. The _Boletus edulis_ they represent as containing in 100 parts of the dried substance 22.82 per cent. of protein. The nitrogenous values of different foods as compared with the mushroom are stated as follows: \"Protein substances calculated for 100 parts of bread, 8.03; of oatmeal, 9.74; of barley bread, 6.39; of leguminous fruits, 27.05; of potatoes, 4.85; of mushrooms, 33.0.\"  According to Schlossberger and Depping, in 100 grams of dried mushrooms they found the following proportions of nitrogenous substances:          -----------------------+--------           Varieties.           | Grains.                                |         Chanterelles           |  3.22         Certain Russulas       |  4.25         Lactarius deliciosus   |  4.68         Boletus edulis         |  4.25         Meadow mushroom        |  7.26         -----------------------+--------  But all chemists are not agreed as to these proportions. For instance, Lefort has found 3.51 grains of nitrogenous matter in the cap of _Agaricus campestris_, 2.1 grains in the gills and only 0.34 of a grain in the stem. Payen has found 4.68 grains in _Agaricus campestris_, 4.4 grains in the common Morel (_Morchella esculenta_), 9.96 grains in the white truffle, and 8.76 grains in the black.  A much larger proportion of the various kinds of mushrooms are edible than is generally supposed, but a prejudice has grown up concerning them in this country which it will take some time to eradicate. Notwithstanding the occurrence of occasional fatal accidents through the inadvertent eating of poisonous species, fungi are largely consumed both by savage and civilized man in all parts of the world, and while they contribute so considerable a portion of the food product of the world we may be sure their value will not be permanently overlooked in the United States, especially when we consider our large accessions of population from countries in which the mushroom is a familiar and much prized edible. In Italy the value of the mushroom as an article of diet has long been understood and appreciated. Pliny, Galen, and Dioscorides mention various esculent species, notably varieties of the truffle, the boletus and the puff-ball, and Vittadini writes enthusiastically of the gastronomic qualities of a large number of species. Of late years large quantities have been sold in the Italian markets. Quantities of mushrooms are also consumed in Germany, Hungary, Russia, France, and Austria.  Darwin speaks of Terra del Fuego as the only country where cryptogamic plants form a staple article of food. A bright-yellow fungus allied to _Bulgarin_ forms, with shellfish, the staple food of the Fuegians. In England the common meadow mushroom _Agaricus campestris_ is quite well known and used to a considerable extent among the people, but there is not that general knowledge of and use of other species which obtains in Continental Europe.  In the English-speaking countries much has been done by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, Dr. M. C. Cooke, Worthington G. Smith, Rev. John Stevenson, Prof. Hay, Prof. Chas. H. Peck, Prof. W. J. Farlow, and others, including the various mushroom clubs, to disseminate a more general knowledge on this subject.  Late investigations show that nearly all the species common to the countries of Continental Europe, and of Great Britain, are found in different localities in the United States, and a number of species have been found which have not been described in European works.  The geographical distribution of many species of the mushroom family is very wide. We have had specimens of the _Morel_, for instance, sent to us from California and Washington, on the Pacific coast, and as far north as Maine, on the Atlantic, as well as from the southern and the midwestern States, and the same is true of other species. The season of their appearance varies somewhat according to the latitude and altitude of place of growth. Mushrooms are rarely seen after the first heavy frosts, although an exception is noted in this latitude in the species Hypholoma sublatertium, which has been found growing under the snow, at the roots of trees in sheltered woods. Frozen mushrooms of this and closely allied species have revived when thawed, and proved quite palatable when cooked.  At the present time only two species, Agaricus campester and Agaricus arvensis, are cultivated in America. Some attempts have been made by an amateur mushroom club in Ohio to cultivate the Morel, but the results have not, so far, been reported. In the meantime, however, it is well to utilize the wild mushrooms as fast as the collector can satisfactorily identify them. The woods of all moist regions of this country abound with edible varieties. Prof. Curtis, of North Carolina, gives a list of over one hundred edible species found in that State alone, and nearly all of these occur in our Northern States as well. It is not contended that this list includes all the species which may be eaten, nor have all of these equal value from a gastronomic point of view. Some are insipid as to flavor, and others are too tough or too slimy to please the popular taste.     CAUTIONARY SUGGESTIONS.   Before collecting for the table mushrooms found growing in the woods or fields, it would be well for inexperienced persons to consult carefully some work on the subject in which the characteristics of edible and poisonous varieties are described and illustrated.  Considering that an opinion seems to prevail that the discoloration of the silver spoon or small white onions when brought into contact with mushrooms during the culinary process is an infallible test of the poisonous species, I quote from a French author on mushrooms the following in relation to this supposed test:      * * * We may not dispute the fact that a silver spoon or article of     brass, or onions, may not become discolored on contact with the     poisonous principle, but this discoloration is not reliable as a     test for deciding the good or bad quality of mushrooms. In fact, we     know that in the decomposition of albuminoids sulphureted hydrogen     is liberated which of itself discolors silver, brass, and onions.  I have deemed it advisable to publish this as one of the best means of answering those correspondents who have made inquiries as to the reliability of this test.  It is by some supposed that high colors and viscidity are indications of non-edible species, but there are numerous exceptions here. _Russula alutacea_--the pileus of which is often a purplish red--_Amanita Cæsarea_, and other species of brilliant coloring are known to be edible. As to viscidity, two very viscid species, when young, are among the highly prized esculents by those who know them, viz., _Fistulina hepatica_, or the ox tongue, and _Hygrophorus eburneus_, the ivory mushroom.  The method of deciding the character of mushrooms by their odor and flavor is not to be relied upon. Edible mushrooms are usually characterized"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],["title","Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#4)"],["body","a pleasant flavor and odor; non-edible varieties have sometimes an unpleasant odor, and produce a biting, burning sensation on the tongue and throat, even in very small quantities, but several of the _Amanitas_ have only a slight odor and taste, and certain species of mushrooms, acrid otherwise, become edible when cooked.  In fact there is no general rule by which the edible species can be distinguished from the unwholesome or poisonous ones. The safest as well as the most sensible plan, therefore, is to apply the same rule as that which we adopt in the case of the esculents among the flowering plants, viz., to learn to know the characteristics of each individual species so as to distinguish it from all others.  With regard to the mushrooms which have been designated as poisonous, it should be remembered that the term \"poisonous\" is used relatively. While some are only slightly poisonous, producing severe gastric irritation and nervous derangement, but without fatal results, others, if eaten in even very small quantity, may cause death. Happily, however, the most dangerous species are not numerous as compared with the number that are edible, and with careful attention on the part of the collector they may be avoided.  Since the Amanita group is made responsible by competent authority for most of the recorded cases of fatal poisoning, we would recommend the amateur mycophagist to give special study to this group in order to learn to separate the species authentically recorded as edible from the poisonous ones.  Some writers, as a measure of precaution, counsel the rejection of all species of Amanita. But this is, of course, a matter for individual preference. There would seem to be no good reason why the observant student should not learn to discriminate between the edible and the poisonous species of the Amanita as of any other group, and they should not be eaten until this discriminating knowledge is acquired.  Saccardo describes fifteen edible species of this group of mushrooms. We have tested three of this number, which, on account of their abundance in our locality and their good flavor, we would be loth to discard, viz., A. rubescens, A. Cæsarea, and A. strobiliformis.  A type of the Amanita group, which is named first in the genera of the order Agaricini, is shown in Fig. 1, Plate B.  By reference to this figure some of the special characteristics of the group can be observed. There are mushrooms in other genera which show a volva or sheath at the base of the stem, and which contain edible species, but in these the stem is ringless. The Volvariæ, for instance, show a conspicuous volva, a stem that is ringless, and pinkish spores. The Amanitopsis vaginata carries a volva, but no ring. The spores are white, as in the Amanita.  In gathering mushrooms either for the table or for the herbarium, care should be taken not to leave any portion of the plant in the ground, so that no feature shall be lost that will aid in characterizing the species. In the careless pulling up of the plant the volva in the volvate species is often left behind.          AGARICINI. Fries.       LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE, OR YELLOWISH).  _Genus Russula_ Fr. The _Russulæ_ bear some resemblance to the _Lactars_, their nearest allies, but are at once distinguished from them by their want of milk.  They are very abundant in the forests and open woods. The genus is cited by some authors as the most natural of the agarics, but, as many of the species very closely resemble each other, it requires careful analysis to determine them. The plants of this genus are not volvate, and have neither veil nor ring. The hymenophore is not separate from the trama of the gills. Although some are pure white, the caps are usually brilliant in coloring, but the color is very susceptible to atmospheric changes, and after heavy rains the bright hues fade, sometimes only leaving a slight trace of the original coloring in the central depression of the cap.  The cap in youth is somewhat hemispherical, afterwards expanding, becoming slightly depressed in the centre, somewhat brittle in texture; gills rigid, fragile, with acute edge; stem thick, blunt, and polished, usually short. The spores are globose, or nearly so, slightly rough, white or yellowish, according to the species. In R. virescens the spores are white, while in R. alutacea the spores are an ochraceous yellow in tint.  A number of the species are of pleasant flavor, others peppery or acrid. Out of seventy-two described by Cooke, twenty-four are recorded as acrid. With some of these the acridity is said to disappear in cooking, and a few mycophagists claim to have eaten all varieties with impunity. We have recorded, however, some well authenticated cases of serious gastric disturbance, accompanied by acute inflammation of the mucous membrane, caused by the more acrid of these, notably _R. emetica_ and _R. foetens_, and in view of this fact it would seem a wise precaution for the _amateur_ collector to discard or at least to use very sparingly all those which have an acrid or peppery taste, until well assured as to their wholesomeness.  The _genus Russula_ has been divided into the following tribes or groups:--Compactæ, Furcatæ, Rigidæ, Heterophylla, and Fragiles. The species _Russula (Rigidæ) virescens_, illustrated in Plate I, belongs to the tribe Rigidæ. In the plants of this group, the cap is absolutely dry and rigid, destitute of a viscid pellicle; the cuticle commonly breaking up into flocci or granules; the flesh thick, compact, and firm, vanishing near the margin, which is never involute, and shows no striations. The gills are irregular in length, some few reaching half way to the stem, the others divided, dilated, and extending into a broad rounded end, stem solid.       [Illustration: Plate I.      RUSSULA VIRESCENS FR. (EDIBLE)      The Verdette From Nature      Collected in the District of Columbia      Report of Microscopist, U. S. Department of Agriculture 1893      L. Krieger, Pinx.      AVIL. CO. LITH. PHILA.]       PLATE I.       =Russula virescens= Fries. \"_The Verdette_\" _or_ \"_Greenish Russula_.\"       EDIBLE.  The cap of this species is fleshy and dry, the skin breaking into thin patches. The margin is usually even, but specimens occur which show striations. The color varies from a light green to a grayish or moldy green, sometimes tinged with yellow; gills white, free from the stem or nearly so, unequal, rather crowded; stem white, stout, solid, smooth, at first hard, then spongy; spores white, nearly globose.  One writer speaks of the \"warts\" of the cap, but the term warts, used in this connection, refers merely to the patches resulting from the splitting or breaking up of the epidermis of the cap, and not to such excrescences called warts, as are commonly observed on the cap of Amanita muscaria, for instance, which are remnants of the volva.  The _R. virescens_ is not as common as some others of the Russulæ, in some localities, and hitherto seems to have attracted but little attention as an edible species in this country, although highly esteemed in Europe. It has been found growing in thin woods in Maryland and in Virginia from June to November, and we have had reports of its growth from New York and Massachusetts. The peasants in Italy are in the habit of toasting these mushrooms over wood embers, eating them afterwards with a little salt. Vittadini, Roques, and Cordier speak highly of its esculent qualities and good flavor. We have eaten quantities of the virescens gathered in Washington, D. C., and its suburbs, and found it juicy and of good flavor when cooked.       EXPLANATION OF PLATE I.  Plate I exhibits four views of this mushroom (_R. virescens_) drawn and colored from nature. Fig. 1, the immature plant; Fig. 2, advanced stage of growth, cap expanded or plane; Fig. 3, section showing the unequal length of the gills and manner of their attachment to the stem; Fig. 4, surface view of the cap showing the epidermis split in characteristic irregular patches; Fig. 5, spores, white.       AGARICINI.       COPRINARII (SPORES BLACK OR NEARLY SO).  Genus _Coprinus_ Fries. Hymenophore distinct from the stem. Gills membranaceous, at first coherent from the pressure, then dissolving into a black fluid. Trama obsolete. Spores, oval, even, black. M. C. Cooke.  The plants of this genus have been divided into two tribes, viz., _Pelliculosi_ and _Veliformis_. In the _Pelliculosi_ the gills of the mushrooms are covered with a fleshy or membranaceous cuticle, hence the cap is not furrowed along the lines of the gills, but is torn and revolute. In this tribe are included the _Comati_, _Atramentarii_, _Picacei_, _Tomentosi_, _Micacio_ and _Glabrati_. In the tribe _Veliformis_ the plants are generally very small, and the cap much thinner than in those of the _Pelliculosi_, soon showing distinct furrows along the back of the gills, which quickly melt into very thin lines. The stem is thin and fistulose.  Cordier states that all the species of _Coprinus_ are edible when young and fresh. This is probably true, but most of them have so little substance and are so ephemeral as to be of small value for food purposes. _C. comatus_, _C. atramentarius_, _C. micaceus_, and _C. ovatus_ have the preference with most mycophagists, but even these soon melt, and should be gathered promptly and cooked immediately to be of use for the table.
