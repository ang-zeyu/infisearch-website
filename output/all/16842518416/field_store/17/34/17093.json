After a time she said gently, “She is better off.”  A look of doubt and pain and fear came into Macdonald's eyes.  “She never came forward,” he said, hesitatingly. “She was afraid to come.”  “I have heard of her often, Mr. Macdonald, and I have heard that she was a good and gentle woman.”  “Aye, she was that.”  “And kind to the sick.”  “You may believe it.”  “And she loved the house of God.”  “Aye, and neither rain nor snow nor mud would be keeping her from it, but she would be going every Sabbath day, bringing her stockings with her.”  “Her stockings?”  “Aye, to change her feet in the church. What else? Her stockings would be wet with the snow and water.”  Mrs. Murray nodded. “And she loved her Saviour, Mr. Macdonald.”  “Indeed, I believe it well, but she was afraid she would not be having 'the marks.'”  “Never you fear, Mr. Macdonald,” said Mrs. Murray. “If she loved her Saviour she is with him now.”  He turned around to her and lifted himself eagerly on his elbow. “And do you really think that?” he said, in a voice subdued and anxious.  “Indeed I do,” said Mrs. Murray, in a tone of certain conviction.  Macdonald sank back on his pillow, and after a moment's silence, said, in a voice of pain: “Oh, but it is a peety she did not know! It is a peety she did not know. For many's the time before--before--her hour came on her, she would be afraid.”  “But she was not afraid at the last, Mr. Macdonald?”  “Indeed, no. I wondered at her. She was like a babe in its mother's arms. There was a light on her face, and I mind well what she said.”  Macdonald paused. There was a stir in the kitchen, and Mrs. Murray, glancing behind her, saw Ranald standing near the door intently listening. Then Macdonald went on. “I mind well the words, as if it was yesterday. 'Hugh, my man,' she said, 'am no feared' (she was from the Lowlands, but she was a fine woman); 'I haena the marks, but 'm no feared but He'll ken me. Ye'll tak' care o' Ranald, for, oh, Hugh! I ha' gi'en him to the Lord. The Lord help you to mak' a guid man o' him.'”  Macdonald's voice faltered into silence, then, after a few moments, he cried, “And oh! Mistress Murra', I cannot tell you the often these words do keep coming to me; and it is myself that has not kept the promise I made to her, and may the Lord forgive me.”  The look of misery in the dark eyes touched Mrs. Murray to the heart. She laid her hand on Macdonald's arm, but she could not find words to speak. Suddenly Macdonald recalled himself.  “You will forgive me,” he said; “and you will not be telling any one.”  By this time the tears were streaming down her face, and Mrs. Murray could only say, brokenly, “You know I will not.”  “Aye, I do,” said Macdonald, with a sigh of content, and he turned his face away from her to the wall.  “And now you let me read to you,” she said, softly, and taking from her bag the Gaelic Bible, which with much toil she had learned to read since coming to this Highland congregation, she read to him from the old Psalm those words, brave, tender, and beautiful, that have so often comforted the weary and wandering children of men, “The Lord is my Shepherd,” and so on to the end. Then from psalm to psalm she passed, selecting such parts as suited her purpose, until Macdonald turned to her again and said, admiringly:  “It is yourself that has the bonnie Gaelic.”  “I am afraid,” she said, with a smile, “it is not really good, but it is the best a south country woman can do.”  “Indeed, it is very pretty,” he said, earnestly.  Then the minister's wife said, timidly, “I cannot pray in the Gaelic.”  “Oh, the English will be very good,” said Macdonald, and she knelt down and in simple words poured out her heart in prayer. Before she rose from her knees she opened the Gaelic Bible, and turned to the words of the Lord's Prayer.  “We will say this prayer together,” she said, gently.  Macdonald, bowing his head gravely, answered: “It is what she would often be doing with me.”  There was still only one woman to this lonely hearted man, and with a sudden rush of pity that showed itself in her breaking voice, the minister's wife began in Gaelic, “Our Father which art in heaven.”  Macdonald followed her in a whisper through the petitions until they came to the words, “And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,”  when he paused and would say no more. Mrs. Murray repeated the words of the petition, but still there was no response. Then the minister's wife knew that she had her finger upon a sore spot, and she finished the prayer alone.  For a time she sat silent, unwilling to probe the wound, and yet too brave to flinch from what she felt to be duty.  “We have much to be forgiven,” she said, gently. “More than we can ever forgive.” Still there was silence.  “And the heart that cannot forgive an injury is closed to the forgiveness of God.”  The morning sun was gleaming through the treetops, and Mrs. Murray was worn with her night's vigil, and anxious to get home. She rose, and offering Macdonald her hand, smiled down into his face, and said: “Good by! We must try to forgive.”  As he took her hand, Macdonald's dark face began to work, and he broke forth into a bitter cry.  “He took me unawares! And it was a coward's blow! and I will not forgive him until I have given him what he deserves, if the Lord spares me!” And then he poured forth, in hot and bitter words, the story of the great fight. By the time he had finished his tale Ranald had come in from the kitchen, and was standing with clenched fists and face pale with passion at the foot of the bed.  As Mrs. Murray listened to this story her eyes began to burn, and when it was over, she burst forth: “Oh, it was a cruel and cowardly and brutal thing for men to do! And did you beat them off?” she asked.  “Aye, and that we did,” burst in Ranald. And in breathless haste and with flashing eye he told them of Macdonald Bhain's part in the fight.  “Splendid!” cried the minister's wife, forgetting herself for the moment.  “But he let him go,” said Ranald, sadly. “He would not strike him, but just let him go.”  Then the minister's wife cried again: “Ah, he is a great man, your uncle! And a great Christian. Greater than I could have been, for I would have slain him then and there.” Her eyes flashed, and the color flamed in her face as she uttered these words.  “Aye,” said Macdonald Dubh, regarding her with deep satisfaction. His tone and look recalled the minister's wife, and turning to Ranald, she added, sadly:  “But your uncle was right, Ranald, and we must forgive even as he did.”  “That,” cried Ranald, with fierce emphasis, “I will never do, until once I will be having my hands on his throat.”  “Hush, Ranald!” said the minister's wife. “I know it is hard, but we must forgive. You see we MUST forgive. And we must ask Him to help us, who has more to forgive than any other.”  But she said no more to Macdonald Dubh on that subject that morning. The fire of the battle was in her heart, and she felt she could more easily sympathize with his desire for vengeance than with the Christian grace of forgiveness. But as they rode home together through the bush, where death had trailed them so closely the night before, the sweet sunlight and the crisp, fresh air, and all the still beauty of the morning, working with the memory of their saving, rebuked and soothed and comforted her, and when Ranald turned back from the manse door, she said softly: “Our Father in heaven was very good to us, Ranald, and we should be like him. He forgives and loves, and we should, too.”  And Ranald, looking into the sweet face, pale with the long night's trials, but tinged now with the faintest touch of color from the morning, felt somehow that it might be possible to forgive.  But many days had to come and go, and many waters flow over the souls of Macdonald Dubh and his son Ranald, before they were able to say, “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.”    CHAPTER VI  A NEW FRIEND   The night race with the wolves began a new phase of life for Ranald, for in that hour he gained a friend such as it falls to few lads to have. Mrs. Murray's high courage in the bush, her skill in the sick-room, and that fine spiritual air she carried with her made for her a place in his imagination where men set their divinities. The hero and the saint in her stirred his poetic and fervent soul and set it aglow with a feeling near to adoration. To Mrs. Murray also the events of that night set forth Ranald in a new light. In the shy, awkward, almost sullen lad there had suddenly been revealed in those moments of peril the cool, daring man, full of resource and capable of self-sacrifice. Her heart went out toward him, and she set herself to win his confidence and to establish a firm friendship with him; but this was no easy matter.  Macdonald Dubh and his son, living a half-savage life in their lonely back clearing, were regarded by their neighbors with a certain degree of distrust and fear. They were not like other people. They seldom mingled in the social festivities of the community, and consequently were more or less excluded from friendship and free intercourse with their neighbors. Ranald, shy, proud, and sensitive, felt this exclusion, and in return kept himself aloof even from the boys, and especially from the girls, of his own age. His attendance at school was of a fragmentary and spasmodic nature, and he never really came to be on friendly terms with his fellow-pupils. His one friend was Don Cameron, whom the boys called “Wobbles,” from his gait in running, whose father's farm backed that of Macdonald Dubh. And though Don was a year older, he gave to Ranald a homage almost amounting to worship, for in all those qualities that go to establish leadership among boys, Ranald was easily first. In the sport that called for speed, courage, and endurance Ranald was chief of all.

COSTELLO  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories January 1943. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]   [Sidenote: Mr. Demise had Reggie Van Fiddler's name in his book, but Reggie didn't want to be on any list, so he set out to correct the mistake!]   When Reggie Van Fiddler sauntered into the cool somber depths of the Midland Club's lobby, he was feeling in an exceptionally amiable mood. There was a song in his heart and a bland, dreamily vague smile on his long, narrow face.  This state of blissful tranquility could be attributed to the fact that Reggie's tan and white shoes were taking him directly toward the Club Bar, where he planned to while away the day sipping various long, cool drinks. And Reggie was always happy when the immediate future held the prospects of a drink.  He nodded brightly to a uniformed attendant.  \"Glorious morning, isn't he?\" he said.  \"It was a glorious morning,\" the attendant corrected politely.  Reggie looked blankly at a clock on the wall and a puzzled frown spread over his equine features.  \"Well, well,\" he muttered, shaking his head, \"how'd that happen?\" He sauntered on toward the bar, nibbling at a hang nail. The morning had slipped away from him somehow. Here it was two o'clock in the afternoon already. It was quite a blow.  He remembered then that he had slept until twelve thirty and he brightened considerably. That explained it. Whistling merrily he strode on into the dim cool bar, with its heavy brown fixtures and solid atmosphere of masculinity.  The bartender set up his usual drink and with knowledge born of long experience, immediately began the preparation of a second.  Reggie sipped his drink and relaxed.  For several moments he stood at the bar, lazily contented, his brain slowed to about one revolution per minute. Finally he happened to glance toward the end of the bar and he noticed a small, dark, narrow-eyed man watching him closely.  Reggie smiled uncertainly and returned to his drink. The dark man at the end of the bar was the only other customer and Reggie knew that he was not a member of the club, for he had never seen him before in his life.  Reggie finished his drink and when the bartender set another before him he glanced again toward the end of the bar. The little dark man was still there, regarding him, it seemed, with a steady fixed stare.  Reggie coughed nervously and gulped his drink. There was something in the dark little man's beady-eyed gaze that disturbed him. He had another quick drink and peeked from the corner of his eye at the little dark man.  There was something sinister about the chap, he felt sure. Reggie was the owner of an extremely lurid imagination and now, warmed by the glow of alcohol, he began to envision all sorts of wild possibilities.  After his fourth drink he was certain that the man was an Axis agent. Just why an Axis agent would be staring at him he had no idea, but he still felt sure the man was a Nazi.         *       *       *       *       *  Reggie finished his drink and set the glass on the bar. Then he casually sauntered toward the door. A few paces from the room's only exit, he paused and under the pretense of inspecting a faded sports print on the wall, sneaked a quick glance at the dark little man.  The dark little man was still staring at him with narrowed, shaded eyes.  Reggie yawned ostentatiously and inched closer to the door. He was going to make a break for it, but it would have to be fast and clever. His heart was pounding with more gusto than usual and there were bright spots of excitement in his pale cheeks. This new role of dodging the Gestapo appealed enormously to his comic strip sense of melodrama.  Headlines popped before his mind's eye.       REGGIE VAN FIDDLER MAKES ESCAPE!  From what he was going to escape he wasn't quite sure, but he felt that the details would be in the body of the news story. Headlines didn't tell everything, did they?  Within a foot of the door he turned casually and took one last look at the little man who was staring so intently at him. Then, with a sudden slithering motion, he slipped through the door.  He collided heavily with a small figure.  \"I'm sorry,\" he stammered. \"I'm in a bit of a hurry.\"  He turned and started away, but he had barely taken three strides when he jerked to a stop. An expression of dazed amazement stole over his face and his sleepy eyes opened wide.  Wheeling suddenly he stared back at the small figure he had collided with. The man was still standing in the corridor that led from the bar, regarding Reggie with a fixed, thoughtful expression.  And he was the same dark little man Reggie had left _inside_ the bar room seconds before!  Reggie gulped audibly. His adam's apple bobbed in his throat like a mouse in a sock.  _How had the dark little man gotten out of the bar ahead of him?_  Reggie didn't know and he had no inclination to wait and ask questions. With one last incredulous look over his shoulder he wheeled and loped across the lobby, down the marble steps, through the club's revolving doors and into the street.  He walked swiftly, mopping his forehead with his handkerchief.  The experience had been an unnerving one. When he reached the end of the block he hailed a cab and gave the driver the address of another bar.  As the cab rolled across the Loop Reggie settled back and gnawed nervously at his finger nails. Thoughtful meditation and analysis were not his strongest suits; in fact any thinking at all was an annoying chore to him, but he felt now that he had better bend his brain to the problem of the dark little man whom he'd seen at the club.  The chap was obviously interested in him, but why? There was no reasonable answer to that question, and there was no explanation to the way the little fellow had popped up _outside_ the bar, when Reggie had seen him, a split-second before, _inside_ the bar.         *       *       *       *       *  Reggie was still stewing over these matters when the cab came to a stop before a swanky glitter joint which catered to afternoon revellers and jitterbugs of both sexes.  Inside the smoky, dimly lighted den of din and discord Reggie forgot his troubles long enough to order a drink, his fifth of the afternoon. He was conscious of a vague buzzing between his ears and there was a pleasant mellow glow in the region of his solar plexus.  Had it not been for his disturbing experience at the Midland club, he would have been feeling very, very fine.  When his drink arrived he sipped it appreciatively and glanced about the crowded bar, looking for a familiar face. In one corner of the room he saw a tall young man in tweeds lounging against the wall with a drink in his hand. With a glad cry Reggie scrambled from his bar stool and lurched across the crowded floor, weaving his way with drunken dexterity through the jitterbugging maniacs.  \"Hi!\" he cried, when he reached the tweed-clad young man's side. \"How've you been, Ricky? Have a drink?\"  \"Been fine,\" the young man answered. \"Got a drink. Name isn't Ricky.\"  \"Not Ricky?\" Reggie shook his head frowning. \"Could've sworn you were good old Ricky Davis, chap I knew at school. Well, how're things?\"  \"Good,\" the young man answered. \"Have a drink?\"  \"Got one,\" Reggie said. \"Got to go now. It's been nice seeing you again, Ricky.\"  He started to weave his way back to the bar. Suddenly he stopped, his eyes focusing in fascination on the figure of a man at the bar. A man who had appropriated the seat which Reggie had vacated.  The man was small and dark. His eyes were narrow and inscrutable. He was the same person Reggie had seen at the club.  The breath left Reggie's lungs in a rush.  Obviously the man had followed him here!  As he stood, transfixed, in the middle of the floor, the man turned and looked straight at him, a peculiar thoughtful expression on his dark face. After studying Reggie for a long interval he turned slowly back to the bar.  Reggie swallowed what was left of his drink in one gulp, but the liquor had no effect on him. After the shock he'd received it would take liquid dynamite to bolster him up.  He reeled back to the tall young man who was leaning against the wall.  \"Ricky!\" he cried hoarsely. \"I'm being followed. Axis agents are after me.\"  \"Name isn't Ricky,\" the tall young man said. \"Why?\"  \"Why what?\" Reggie said blankly. He seemed to have fumbled the conversational ball. He wished the young man would speak with more clarity and add a few articles and pronouns to his sentences.  \"Why are they following you?\" the young man said peevishly. \"Nothing better to do?\"  \"That's just it,\" Reggie said. \"I don't know why I'm being followed. But everywhere I go this little man sticks to me like a postage stamp.\"  \"Where is he now?\"  Reggie pointed dramatically at the dark little man.  \"At the bar. He took the stool I left. He's right between that fat old man and that young girl with the red hair.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The tweed-clad young man stared in the direction of Reggie's pointing finger, then he frowned and glanced down at Reggie.  \"Any pink elephants, yet?\"  \"I'm not drunk,\" Reggie said indignantly. \"That man has been following me like a conga partner all afternoon.\"  The tall young man patted Reggie patiently on the shoulder.  \"Sleep and rest will make a new man of you,\" he said. \"Go home. Go to bed. You've got hallucinations.\"  \"Hallucinations!\" Reggie cried over the din of the orchestra. \"What do you mean? Don't you see the man I mean? Right between the fat old man and the girl with the red hair?\"  The tweedish young man shook his head.  \"The stool between the fat old man and the red-haired girl is completely unoccupied,\" he said in the patient voice of a man instructing a very young child.  Reggie shook his head bewilderedly. There was a sudden cold hollow in the pit of his stomach."]]]
