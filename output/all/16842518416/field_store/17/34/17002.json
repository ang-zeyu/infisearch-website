The kid had fallen for the girl as sure as I stood there.  \"Now, look,\" I said gently. \"You really want to get set with Uncle Sam, don't you?\"  \"Why, sure.\"  \"Then listen to me. I'm doing everything I can for you. And I've got a deal all lined up. I was just over at the Army recruiting station and I think everything is set. Not right away, but pretty soon.\"  \"Gosh, that's wonderful.\"  \"Now you know who your friend is.\" I came over beside him and put my hand on his shoulder. \"I got a little piece of advice for you that I want you to take to heart. Stay away from this kid, Alice. She's no good for you.\"  \"Now just a minute. You can't--\"  \"I'm sorry, kid,\" I said. I let my hand fall from his shoulder. \"Maybe I shouldn't tell you, but--\"  \"Tell me what?\"  \"It's only for your own good I'm doing this. That pretty little blonde is just going to play you for a sucker. She's already married.\"  Horatio gasped. He must have been pretty sold on the girl.  \"I don't believe it,\" he cried.  \"It's God's truth.\"  \"Who is the man?\" Horatio cried brokenly.  \"Mystiffio.\"  \"Mystiffio!\"  I nodded slowly. \"It's a tough break, kid, but the sooner you forget her the better.\" I had already decided I'd get rid of her. She wouldn't be hard to replace. Horatio was my gold mine and I didn't want anyone to do a scorched-earth job on him.  \"But she never told me,\" he muttered.  \"Naturally,\" I said. \"She'll probably even deny she's married to him now, but don't let that fool you.\"  \"No, sir,\" Horatio said. \"She won't make a sucker out of me.\" His anger must have subconsciously affected his visibility mechanism for he was visible and his lean jaw was hard, but there was a hurt look in his clear blue eyes.  \"That's the boy,\" I said. \"Just remember who your friends are and you won't go wrong.\"  \"I won't, Mr. Flannigan,\" he promised solemnly.         *       *       *       *       *  The next afternoon Morry arrived to see the act. He was dressed in a natty pin stripe suit and he wore a big yellow carnation in the buttonhole, but his sallow face was impassive.  I escorted him down the dark empty theatre to the front row.  \"Just hold your breath now,\" I told him. \"I'll have the act on stage in a jiffy.\"  He yawned and glanced at his watch.  \"I haven't got long,\" he said.  I went backstage and found Alice.  \"Hurry up,\" I said. \"Morry is waiting.\"  She looked at me as if I'd just crawled out from the wainscoating. \"I've just talked to the kid,\" she said. \"He thinks I'm poison. What kind of a yarn have you been feeding him?\"  \"Me? Why, honey, that hurts. Do you think your Uncle Patrick would breathe an unkind word about you?\"  \"Well, it's mighty strange,\" she said. \"He won't even tell me what's biting him.\"  \"I wouldn't pay any attention to him,\" I said. \"Perhaps it's all for the best.\"  \"Hmmm,\" she said, eyeing me shrewdly.  \"Come on now, be a good kid and get things rolling. A lot depends on this you know.\"  I went back and joined Morry.  Well the act was terrific. Mystiffio had Morry's eyes sticking out inside of thirty seconds. I hadn't told Morry about Horatio. I figured I'd let that angle ride for a while.  But Morry was really impressed.  \"The guy is good,\" he said. \"The things he does don't seem humanly possible.\"  Of course he didn't know that most of the effects were being created by the invisible Horatio but what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him. And he didn't miss Alice, either. When she came on stage in her cute, abbreviated little costume, he straightened up and opened his eyes.  \"The kid is nice,\" he murmured.  \"Are we in?\" I demanded.  \"Can't say yet. I gotta talk to the act but I'd say your chances were pretty good.\"  I almost swooned with happiness. The break I'd been waiting for all my life was here at last. The golden apples were about ready to drop into my lap.         *       *       *       *       *  When Mystiffio finished his routine I took Morry backstage. I found Alice.  \"Here she is, Morry,\" I said. \"And she's just as nice as she looks.\" I shoved Alice toward him. \"Be nice, baby,\" I hissed in her ear.  Morry took one of her little hands and his eyes were interested.  \"I kinda like the act,\" he said. \"If you could find time to be nice to me I might like it a whole lot.\"  Alice takes her hand back as if it had accidentally brushed something slimy.  \"I'm sorry but I don't go with the act,\" she snapped. \"There are some things worth more to me than three meals a day and a paycheck.\"  \"Okay, sister,\" Morry said without expression. He turned to me. \"Guess I made a mistake coming up here. The act is lousy.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I yelled. \"You said it was good. You can't walk out now.\" I wheeled to Alice. \"Baby, baby, don't do this to me. Tell him you're sorry.\"  Mystiffio came up behind us while we were talking.  \"What is the matter?\" he asked. I noticed he put an arm around Alice's shoulders. I was too distraught to think about it.  \"Nothing's wrong,\" I said desperately. \"Alice just took offense at something Morry said. Nobody meant any harm.\"  Mystiffio drew himself up straight and he grabbed Morry by the lapels. Morry struggled to free himself but he was pinioned helplessly.  \"You cad! You bounder!\" Mystiffio roared. \"Do you mean you've been making advances to my daughter?\"  Daughter! How do you like that! That just goes to show you never to trust people.  Morry pulled himself loose.  \"You're all crazy,\" he shouted. \"Lemme out of here.\"  He wheeled and started away, but before he had taken two strides he collided with a solid, unyielding, invisible substance.  He backed away a few steps, his mouth working in terror.  \"What is it?\" he screamed.  \"I'm sorry,\" Horatio's voice sounded in the air a few feet from Morry.  Morry's face went white; he stared wildly about for another instant and then charged madly out of the theatre, screaming in terror.         *       *       *       *       *  I chased after him, but it was a hopeless effort. When I got to the sidewalk he was gone. Moodily I slumped back into the theatre and went backstage. My big opportunity was gone, but I still had Horatio.  I found Alice in the office and she was alone. She smiled sweetly when she saw me.  \"You too, Brutus,\" I muttered. Then I thought about my meal ticket and looked worriedly around the room.  \"Where's Horatio?\" I snapped.  \"Horatio,\" she smiled, \"is gone. Too bad you missed him. He would have liked to say goodbye.\"  \"Goodbye!\" I shrieked. \"Where's he going?\"  \"Into the Army,\" Alice said sweetly. \"Isn't it wonderful?\"  \"You're crazy,\" I shouted. \"The Army won't take him.\"  \"I arranged a little something for him,\" Alice said. \"I'm sure he'll be very useful in the camouflage department.\"  _Camouflage!_  I groaned and sank into a chair.  \"Yes,\" Alice said pleasantly, \"when he learned that Mystiffio was my father--not my husband as you so cleverly told him--he was quite angry for a while. But of course he felt better when he thought it over. And he was very happy to take my suggestion to apply for a commission in the camouflage. I think Horatio and I are going to get along nicely.\"  I groaned again.  Mystiffio stuck his head in the door.  \"Goodbye,\" he said. \"Ready, dear?\"  \"Yes,\" Alice said, moving to the door. \"I'm ready.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I cried. \"Where are you two going? You're the last act I've got.\"  \"I am enlisting!\" Mystiffio said proudly.  \"As what?\"  \"Signal corps, in charge of messenger pigeons.\"  Mystiffio flapped his coat tail and a lone pigeon fluttered into the air. \"I've had a lot of experience with the little devils.\"  I groaned again and dropped my head in my hands.  What was left?  When I looked up, Mystiffio and Alice had gone.  For a moment I sat there staring about the quiet dusty office. Then I stood up and I knew what I was going to do.  I put my hat on and walked out of the building. I didn't stop walking until I reached the Marine recruiting office. A big poster said, \"The Marines Promise You Action!\"  I walked in. Nothing could be worse than what I'd just been through. I felt contented for the first time in sixteen years.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],["title","A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#0)"],["body","OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS                       MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY                  Volume 15, No. 9, pp. 469-491, 4 figs.

Some of these groups, such as _Plectrohyla_ and _Ptychohyla_, have been elevated to generic rank, whereas others are retained in the large and complex genus _Hyla_. In the mountains of México five species of hylids that seem to compose a phyletic unit are herein referred to as the _Hyla bistincta_ group. Since 1955 I have been accumulating specimens of, and data on, this group with the result that all specimens known to me, including the types of all named taxa, have been studied. Detailed observations have been made on the ecology and life histories of three of the species; the other two species are known to me only from preserved specimens.   Acknowledgments  For permission to examine specimens in their care I am indebted to Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Doris M. Cochran, United States National Museum (USNM); Jean Guibé, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris (MNHN); Robert F. Inger, Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM); Hobart M.

Luis Macías Arellano, Departamento de la Fauna Silvestre, Dirección General de Caza. The drawings in figures 1 and 3 were executed by Gail Selfridge. This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF G-9827).     THE HYLA BISTINCTA GROUP   The five species comprising the _Hyla bistincta_ group are moderate-sized hylids having rather blunt heads and robust bodies. The fingers are long and have little webbing (Fig. 1). The skin of the dorsum is thick and glandular, but not tuberculate. An anal sheath is present. The skull is rather broad, flat, and solidly roofed. The ethmoid is broad, curved downward laterally, and solidly sutured to the frontoparietal. The nasals are broad, sutured for their entire width with the ethmoid, and broadly in contact medially. The premaxillaries are in contact medially; each has a long, flat nasal process. The quadratojugal is absent, and the maxillary tapers to a point posteriorly. There is no squamosal-maxillary connection. The maxillary and premaxillary teeth are rather long, bifid, and moderately spatulate. Some teeth on the premaxillary and anterior part of the maxillary are hooked. The vomerine teeth are spatulate and bifid. A broad, flat, ossified prepollex is present but does not project as a spine. The known tadpoles have ventral mouths, 2/3 tooth-rows, two or more rows of labial papillae, and long tails with low fins.      [Illustration: FIG. 1. Palmar view of right hand of:     _a._--_Hyla robertsorum_ (KU 57661),     _b._--_Hyla charadricola_ (KU 58414). × 3.]  As thus defined the _Hyla bistincta_ group can be distinguished from all other groups of Middle American frogs by the combination of absence of the quadratojugal, non-projecting prepollex, long fingers with little webbing, and stream-inhabiting tadpoles having 2/3 tooth rows and two or more rows of labial papillae.  Possibly _Hyla arborescandens_ and _Hyla hazelae_ belong in this group. Because these species are somewhat different from the included species and because their tadpoles are as yet unknown, I have refrained from including these two species in the _Hyla bistincta_ group. Taylor (1948:261) assigned _Hyla proboscidea_ (= _H. dalquesti_) and (1949:272) _Hyla cyclomaculata_ to this group, but because these two species have a quadratojugal and notably different tadpoles, they are excluded from the group.  Frogs of the genus _Plectrohyla_ closely resemble species in the _Hyla bistincta_ group but differ principally in having a projecting prepollex. In the highlands of Costa Rica a group of species, of which _Hyla moesta_ is best known, resembles species in the _Hyla bistincta_ group. At present insufficient information is available on the Costa Rican species to determine their affinities.   Analysis of Characters  The characters used in the systematic study of the frogs in this group are those usually employed in anuran systematics. Of the various measurements and proportions, the snout-vent length and the relative size of the tympanum to the eye apparently are of more taxonomic importance than the others (Table 1). In all of the species the tympanum is at least partially covered by a heavy, dermal supratympanic fold, and in some specimens of _H. pachyderma_ the tympanum is completely obscured. In two species (_H. bistincta_ and _H. charadricola_) the snout is square, whereas in the other species it is round.  The fingers are long and slender in _H. crassa_, _pachyderma_, and _robertsorum_ and somewhat shorter with more webbing in _H. bistincta_ and _charadricola_. Breeding males of _Hyla pachyderma_ have moderately large nuptial spines; the other species have small spines, except _H. charadricola_ in which spines apparently are absent. A well-defined thoracic fold is present in _H. pachyderma_, and a weak fold is present in _H. robertsorum_; the other species lack folds. In all species there is an anal sheath; this sheath is longest in _H. bistincta_, in which the anal opening is directed ventrally at the level of the lower edge of the thighs.

The dorsal color varies from dull green to various shades of brown. The most distinct aspect of the coloration is the different color patterns on the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs. The flanks in all species are marked with spots or reticulations.  _Hyla bistincta_ differs from other members of the group in having vocal slits and a distensible vocal sac. Only this species has been reported to call (Shannon, 1951:473). Insofar as is known, the other species are mute. Examination of skeletal preparations of _H. bistincta_, _charadricola_, and _robertsorum_ and X-rays of the other species shows no notable specific differences in the osteology.
