He talked the matter over with his friend on several occasions, and at last said--  \"Well, I think I have pretty well made up my mind; the doctor is telling me that my poor little chap is not likely to live long; his mother is wrapped up in him, and will never like the place again;--so I think on all grounds a change will be good.  I can't come out with you, because I have got a lease of the farm; but I fancy that it is worth more than it was when I took it, and if I can get a good tenant to take it off my hands I don't suppose the landlord will make any objections.  I shall look about at once, and, when my poor little chap is gone, I shan't be long before I come after you.  You will let me know how you find the place, and whether these book-accounts are true?--I have heard that many of these chaps who write books are awful liars.  I should like to get a farm as near you as may be.\"  It was early in the spring when Mr Humphreys and his party embarked at Plymouth in the _Dunster Castle_.  The farm had sold well, and Mr Humphreys possessed a capital of several thousand pounds--a sum which would make him a rich man in the colony.  None of the party had ever seen the sea before, and the delight of the two boys and the wonderment of the labourers at all they saw was very great.  Mr Humphreys had taken first-class passages for himself and family, while the others of course were steerage passengers.  CHAPTER THREE.  THE FARM.  The voyage to the Cape passed without any incident whatever.  The weather was fine the whole distance.  Without even a single storm to break the monotony they touched at Capetown and Port Elizabeth, and at last arrived at Durban.  The journey had not been too long for the boys; everything was so perfectly new to them that they were never tired of watching the sea and looking for porpoises and the shoals of fish, over which hovered thousands of birds.  Once or twice they saw a whale spout, while flying-fish were matters of hourly occurrence.  They had prodigious appetites, and greatly enjoyed the food, which was altogether different to that to which they had been accustomed.  They had stopped at Madeira and St Vincent, where great stocks of delicious fruit had been taken on board.  Altogether they were quite sorry when they arrived at the end of the voyage.  The landing was effected in large boats, as the _Dunster Castle_ drew too much water to cross the bar at the mouth of the harbour.  They stopped only one day at Durban, where Mr Humphreys hired a waggon to take the party to Pieter-Maritzburg, the capital.  He was not encumbered with baggage, as he had decided to buy everything he wanted in the colony.  \"You may pay dearer,\" he said, \"no doubt; but then you get just what you want.  If I were to take out implements, they might not be suited to the requirements of the country.  As for clothes, they would of course be pretty much the same everywhere; still, it is better to take out only a year's requirements and to buy as we want, instead of lumbering over the country with a quantity of heavy baggage.\"  The party were greatly amused at their first experience of a Cape waggon; it was of very large size, massively built, and covered with a great tilt; and it was drawn by sixteen oxen, spanned two by two.  This was an altogether unnecessary number for the weight which had to be carried, but the waggon had come down loaded from the interior, and Mr Humphreys therefore paid no more than he would have done for a waggon with a small number of oxen.  They took two days to accomplish the journey, the women sleeping at night in the waggon, and Mr Humphreys and his sons in blankets on the ground.  The driver, who was an Englishman, had been many years in the colony, and from him, upon the road, Mr Humphreys gained much valuable information about the country.  The driver was assisted by two Kaffirs, one of whom walked ahead of the leading cattle, the other alongside, shouting and prodding them.  The boys were astonished at the power and accuracy with which the driver whirled his whip; this had a short handle and a lash of twenty yards long, and with it he was able to hit any animal of the team with absolute certainty, and indeed to make the thong alight on any part of their bodies at which he aimed.  On their arrival at Pieter-Maritzburg Mr Humphreys hired a house, and here he placed his party while he set to work to make inquiries after a suitable location.  He soon heard of several places which seemed suitable, and having bought a horse started for Newcastle, a small town situated close to the frontier-line between the Transvaal and Natal.  He was away for three weeks, and on his return informed his wife that he had purchased a farm of 2000 acres, with a substantial farmhouse, at a distance of ten miles from Newcastle, for the sum of 1500 pounds.  The farmhouse was already roughly furnished, but Mr Humphreys purchased a number of other articles, which would make it comfortable and home-like.  He laid in a great stock of groceries, and then hiring a waggon, similar to that in which they had before travelled, started with his party for the farm, having also hired four Kaffirs to assist there. Travelling by easy stages, it took them twelve days to get to Newcastle. The country was undulating and the road rose steadily the whole distance.  Near Pieter-Maritzburg the population was comparatively thick.  The fields were well cultivated and the vegetation thick and luxuriant, but as they ascended the character of the country changed.  Vast stretches of rolling grass everywhere met the eye.  This was now beautifully green, for it was winter.  In the summer and autumn the grass becomes dry and burnt up; fire is then applied to it, and the whole country assumes a black mantle.  But the first shower of rain brings up the young grass and in a very short time the country is covered with fresh verdure.  Mr Humphreys told his wife that, before fixing on the farm, he had ridden into the Transvaal, and found that land could be purchased there even more cheaply than in Natal; but that he had much conversation with English settlers on the frontier, and these had for the most part strongly advised him to settle inside the Natal frontier.  \"It may be that all will be right,\" one had told him, \"but the Boers have not yet recovered from their scare from Secoceni.\"  \"Who is Secoceni, father?\"  Dick asked.  \"The books we have say nothing about him.\"  \"No,\" Mr Humphreys said; \"they were all published a few years since, and none of them treat much of the affairs of the Transvaal, which, as an independent state, had comparatively little interest to English settlers.  There are in the Transvaal, which is of immense extent, a very large number of natives, enormously outnumbering the Boers.  In the southern districts, where the Boers are strongest, they cruelly ill-treat the natives, making slaves of them, and thinking no more of shooting one of them down than they would of shooting a dog.  In the outlying provinces they live almost on sufferance of the natives, and, were these to unite their forces and rise, they could annihilate the Dutch.  Secoceni is a powerful chief, who lives with his tribe in a natural stronghold; he has always held himself as independent of the Dutch.  As his men used to make raids upon the Boers' cattle, the latter attacked him, and in alliance with Swazis, another powerful tribe, endeavoured to carry his fortress; they were, however, badly beaten; it being only by the gallantry of their native allies that the Boer contingent was saved from destruction.  Secoceni then took the offensive.  A perfect panic seized the Boers; they refused to obey the orders of their government, and to turn out to resist the invaders.  The treasury was empty, for their government had never been enabled to persuade them to pay taxes.  They applied for aid to Natal, but finally their plight was so bad that they were glad to accept the offer which Mr Shepstone made them, of annexation to England, by which they secured our protection and were safe from annihilation.  Secoceni was not the only enemy who threatened them.  They had a still more formidable foe in the Zulus on the eastern frontier.  These are a very warlike people, and it was known that their king meditated the conquest of the Transvaal. But, glad enough as the Boers were at the moment to accept the protection of England, now that the danger is over a great many of them would like to kick down the bridge which has helped them over the stream.  They make no secret of their dislike to Englishmen, and although they are glad enough to sell their land at prices immensely in advance of the former value, for indeed land was previously almost unsaleable in the Transvaal, they are on bad terms with them.  One of my informants describes them as a sullen, sulky people, and predicts that sooner or later we shall have trouble with them; so I thought it better altogether to pay a little higher for my land, and to be within the boundaries of this colony.\"  On arriving at the farm Mrs Humphreys was glad to find that the house, though rough, was substantial.  It was built of stone.  The walls were of great thickness, as the stones were laid without mortar, with which, however, it was faced inside and out.  One large room occupied the greater portion of the ground floor; beside this was a small sitting-room.  Upstairs were four bedrooms.  For the time the small room downstairs was turned into a bedroom, which Mr and Mrs Humphreys occupied.  The four bedrooms upstairs just held the rest of the party. The out-houses consisted only of a large barn and a rough stable.  Mr Humphreys at once rode over to Newcastle, and obtained the services of a mason and six Kaffirs, and proceeded to add a wing to the farmhouse.  This was for the use of Johnson and his wife, and Harrison. The whole party were, however, to take their meals together in the great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],["title","The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#5)"],["body","hen.  A hut was also built for the Kaffirs, and another large stable was erected.  A few days after his arrival Mr Humphreys went across the border into the Transvaal, taking Harrison and two of the Kaffirs with him, and returned a fortnight later with a herd of 400 cattle, which he had purchased.  He also bought three yoke of oxen, broken to the plough. Hitherto the farm had been purely a pastoral one, but Mr Humphreys at once began to break up some land for wheat and Indian corn.  The Kaffirs were set to work to fence and dig up a plot round the house for vegetables, and to dig holes near it, over a space of some acres, for the reception of 3000 young fruit-trees--apples, pears, peaches, and plums,--which he had bought at Pieter-Maritzburg, and which were to come up in two months' time.  He also bought six riding-horses.  In a few weeks the farm assumed quite a different appearance.  A gang of Kaffirs, ten strong, had been hired to hurry on the work of preparing the orchard and erecting a fence round it.  Wood was, Mr Humphreys found, extremely scarce and dear, the country being absolutely bare of trees, and wood for fuel was only obtained in kloofs or deep hollows, and had to be fetched long distances.  \"I suppose,\" Mrs Humphreys said to her husband one evening, \"you mean to make cattle-raising your principal point?\"  \"No,\" he said; \"every one raises cattle, and the Dutch can do it cheaper than we can; they have immense tracts of land, and their Kaffir labour costs them next to nothing.  I do not say that we could not live and to a certain extent thrive on cattle, but I think that there is something much better to be done.  Wood is an awful price here, and all that is used has to be brought up from the coast.  I think therefore of planting trees.  The climate is magnificent, and their growth will be rapid. They will of course require fencing to keep out the cattle, but I shall do that, as I am doing the orchard, with wire fencing and light iron-uprights.  Labour is plentiful, and there are large nurseries near Pieter-Maritzburg, where I can procure any number of young trees; so I mean to plant 200 acres a year--in ten years the whole farm will be planted, and the loppings for poles and firewood will in a very short time after planting begin to pay well.  In fifteen years the first 200 acres will be fit to fell, and the property will be worth a very large sum of money.  Of course we can sell out before that if we like.  But at the present price of wood up here, or even should it fall to a quarter of its present price, the value of the 2000 acres of wood will in twenty years be extremely large.\"  The boys were delighted with their new life.  Mr Humphreys had, before leaving England, bought for Dick a Winchester repeating-rifle.  These arms are very light, and Dick was able to carry his without difficulty; and very shortly after their arrival his father had a mark erected at a distance from the house, at which he could practise with safety.  Game was abundant all over the country.  Herds of deer and antelope of various kinds often swept past in sight of the farmhouse, and winged game also abounded.  Mr Humphreys had at home been considered a first-rate shot at partridges, and had for four or five years belonged to the Castleton volunteers, and had carried off many prizes for rifle-shooting.  He was now able, by going out for a few hours once or twice a week, to keep the larder well supplied, and the little flock of fifty sheep, which he had bought for home-consumption, was but seldom drawn upon.  The Kaffirs were fed upon mealies, as they call Indian corn, of which Mr Humphreys had no difficulty in purchasing sufficient for his wants from the neighbouring farmers.  His next neighbours were two brothers, Scotchmen, named Fraser, who lived at a distance of four miles.  They rode over the day after the travellers' arrival, and offered their services in any way.  Mr Humphreys, however, was well supplied with stores of all kinds, and his two white labourers, being both handy men, were able to do all that was required about the house.  The Frasers proved pleasant neighbours, and often rode over and spent Sunday with the Humphreys, and the boys sometimes went over and spent the day with them.  A Kaffir lad, son of one of the men engaged upon the farm, was hired by Mr Humphreys as a special attendant for Dick.  On these vast undulating plains, where there are no trees to serve as a landmark, it is exceedingly difficult for a stranger to find his way.  Dick was told by his father that, whether riding or walking, he was always to take the Kaffir boy with him; and except when he was indulging in a gallop the lad was easily able to keep up with him.  He had been born a hunter, and soon taught Dick how to stalk the timid deer, and, as the lad improved in his shooting, he was ere long enabled to keep the larder supplied--a duty which Mr Humphreys gladly handed over to him, as every minute of his own time was occupied by his work on the farm.  Of an evening after supper, which was partaken of at the conclusion of work, the men retired to their own wing and Mrs Humphreys and the two girls sat down to their sewing by the fire; for upon the uplands the evenings are quite cold enough to find a fire a comfort in winter.  Then the boys would take out their lesson-books and work steadily for three hours.  Under the changed conditions of their life, Mr Humphreys felt that Dick might, if he chose, well discontinue his study of the classics, and his work therefore consisted in the reading of history, travels, and books of scientific knowledge.  \"Next to being a learned man,\" his father said to him, \"the best and most useful thing is to be a thoroughly well-informed man on all general subjects.\"  John, however, continued his studies as before; his life of outdoor exercise strengthened and improved him, and he no longer wished to be always sitting with a book in his hand--still, he had a natural love of study, which his father encouraged, deeming it possible that as he grew up he might be unwilling to embrace the life of a colonist, in which case he determined to send him home to finish his education in England, and afterwards to start him in any profession he might select.  Finding that the cost of carriage up the country was very high, and as he would yearly require many waggon-loads of young trees and fencing Mr Humphreys determined to do his own teaming; he therefore bought two of the large country-waggons and set a Kaffir to work to break in some young steers to the yoke.  Six months after their arrival in the colony they had for the first time visitors to stay at the farm--Mr Jackson, his wife, his son Tom, and two daughters coming out to settle near them.  This was a great delight to the boys, and fortunately Mr Jackson was able to buy a farm of 500 acres adjoining that of his friend; the house, however, was but a cabin, and while a fresh one was being erected the family remained guests of the Humphreys.  Mr Jackson had, at his friend's advice, brought with him from England a labourer with his wife and family, who at once took up their residence in the hut on the farm.  To Dick the coming of the Jacksons was a source of special pleasure. Tom was just his own age, and the two boys had become inseparable friends at home after their adventure in the snow, upon which occasion Tom, as he freely owned, had owed his life to Dick's energy and promptness of suggestion.  Dick was fond of his brother, but three years make a great difference at this period of life, and, as their tastes were wholly dissimilar, John had never been a companion for him.  Since their arrival in South Africa they had got on very well together; still, they had not the same ideas or subjects of thought, and it was an immense delight to Dick to have his old friend and companion with him.  It must not be supposed that Dick's time was occupied solely in amusement; from early morning until dinner-time he worked steadily. Sometimes he assisted to erect the hurdles and strain the wires of the fencing; at others he aided in the planting of the fruit-trees; then he would be with the Kaffirs who were breaking in the oxen for the waggons. At all times he took off his coat and worked with the rest, for, as his father said--  \"If a farmer is to be able properly to look after men at work, he must be able to do the work himself.\"  While Dick was at work with the men, John, who was too young to be of any use, remained indoors at his books, and, although of an afternoon he would stroll out, he seldom went far from the house.  The other boys generally went for long rides when work was done.  One day they sighted a herd of steinbock.  Leaving their horses with the Kaffir lad in a hollow, they crept round so as to get the deer between them and the wind, and managed to reach unobserved a brow within a hundred yards of the herd.  Dick had by this time become a good shot, and the buck at which he aimed fell dead in its tracks.  Tom was not much of a shot, but he had fired into the thick of the deer and gave a shout of delight at seeing one of them fall.  The rest of the herd dashed off at full speed. Tom ran, shouting, forward, but to his mortification the stag that he had hit rose again to its feet and went off at a trot in the direction taken by the others; a minute later the Kaffir boy was seen running towards them at his full speed, leading the horses.  The two boys on his arrival leapt into their saddles and started in pursuit of the wounded stag, which was still in sight, thinking at first they could easily ride it down.  But the animal seemed rather to gain than to lose strength, and, although they had considerably lessened the start he had obtained of them, he still kept steadily on.  Active and wiry as their horses were, they could not overtake it, and the boys had at last the mortification of seeing that the stag was now gaining upon them, and they presently drew rein, and"]]]
