Although _analogus_ does average darker, a topotype, No. 120267 BS, from Zamora, is indistinguishable from several of the topotypes of _allex_. Consequently, we arrange _Peromyscus allex_ Osgood as a synonym of _Baiomys taylori analogus_ (Osgood) 1909 and refer the specimens from Colima to the latter.   ~Peromyscus eremicus eremicus~ (Baird)  Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 28:242, April 17, 1909) listed a specimen of this subspecies from Sierra Encarnación, Nuevo Leon. A specimen, No. 79614 BS, of this species was obtained on July 31, 1896, at Sierra Encarnación, Coahuila, by Nelson and Goldman. We know of no specimens of this subspecies from Sierra Encarnación, Nuevo Leon, and assume that Osgood referred to the Coahuilan specimen. Further support for this assumption is Osgood's (_loc. cit._) note that the Sierra Encarnación specimen is aberrant and, to our eye, so is No. 79614 from Coahuila.   ~Peromyscus merriami merriami~ Mearns  Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 28:239, April 17, 1909) placed _P. merriami_ in synonymy under _Peromyscus eremicus eremicus_ (Baird). Because Seth B. Benson, and subsequently the late Wilfred H. Osgood, told one of us (Hall) that _Peromyscus merriami_ was specifically distinct from _Peromyscus eremicus eremicus_, we have examined the specimens from Sonoyta, Sonora, and Quitobaquita, Arizona, referred by Mearns (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 56:434-435, and 444, April 13, 1907) to _P. e. eremicus_ and _P. merriami_, respectively. We perceive the differences that Mearns (_loc. cit._) described and recognize _P. merriami_ as a species separate from _P. eremicus_.  Also we have compared the type and one topotype of _Peromyscus goldmani_ Osgood with the holotype and referred specimens mentioned above, of _P. merriami_, and feel that the two kinds are no more than subspecifically distinct. Accordingly, _P. goldmani_ should stand as _Peromyscus merriami goldmani_. This arrangement is made with the knowledge that Burt (Misc. Publ. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 39:56, February 15, 1938) arranged _P. goldmani_ as a synonym of _Peromyscus eremicus_.   ~Peromyscus truei preblei~ Bailey  Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 28: 171, April 17, 1909) listed two specimens from Crooked River, 25 miles southeast of Prineville, Oregon, as _Peromyscus truei gilberti_ with the notation \"approaching _truei_?\" Subsequently, Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 55: 188, August 29, 1936) named _Peromyscus truei preblei_ with type locality at Crooked River, 20 miles southeast of Prineville, a place from which Bailey had two specimens. We think the specimens recorded by the two authors are the same, and, according to the specimen labels, were placed correctly as to locality by Bailey. Our reasons are as follows: (a) The specimens mentioned by Bailey were presumably available to Osgood, but Osgood made no mention of specimens from \"20 miles southeast of Prineville,\" (b) we find no specimens nor other records pertaining thereto, of _Peromyscus truei_ from the locality given by Osgood, (c) Osgood indicated that the specimens he saw were not typical of _P. t. gilberti_ and (d) _P. m. gilberti_, geographically the nearest subspecies, is recorded otherwise no closer to Prineville than Grants Pass, approximately 175 miles southwest in southwestern Oregon.   ~Sigmodon hispidus cienegae~ A. B. Howell  J. A. Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:28, March 16, 1893) listed as _Sigmodon hispidus arizonae_ Mearns one specimen from Granados, Sonora, at a time when _S. h. cienegae_ had not been named. We have examined the specimen (5389 AMNH) which has the skull inside and which lacks external measurements. It was taken on November 16, 1890, and is darker than specimens of _S. h. arizonae_ collected in September at Fort Verde, Arizona. The color is essentially as in specimens of _S. h. cienegae_ from Fairbank, Arizona (March-taken specimens). Because of this agreement in color and because of the geographic origin of the specimen from Granados, we refer the animal to _Sigmodon hispidus cienegae_.   ~Sigmodon hispidus zanjonensis~ Goodwin  Goodwin (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 79:169, May 29, 1942) listed four specimens from Honduras (El Jaral, 2; and Las Ventanas, 2) as _Sigmodon hispidus saturatus_ Bailey. Because these localities fall within the geographic range of _S. h. zanjonensis_ we were lead to examine the specimens. Three are young and one (126113 AMNH from Las Ventanas) is an adult female. The underparts of the young are washed with rufous as in _S. h. saturatus_. The adult lacks this rufous as do specimens of _S. h. zanjonensis_ and some specimens of _S. h. saturatus_. In the adult the color of the upper parts and size of the upper cheek-teeth are intermediate between the dark-backed, small-toothed _S. h. saturatus_ and the paler-backed, large-toothed _S. h. zanjonensis_. The rostrum is intermediate in width but definitely nearer the broad condition which obtains in _S. h. saturatus_. The tail is long, actually and in relation to the body (total length 275, tail 130), as in _S. h. zanjonensis_ to which we refer the specimens in question.   ~Oryzomys couesi couesi~ (Alston)  For alleged occurrence at Reforma in Oaxaca, México (Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:31, September 23, 1918), see under _Oryzomys couesi mexicanus_ Allen.   ~Oryzomys couesi mexicanus~ J. A. Allen  Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 43, September 23, 1918) listed, as in the Field Museum of Natural History [= Chicago Natural History Museum] one specimen from Reforma, Oaxaca, under _O. c. mexicanus_ (p. 35) and one specimen from the same place under _O. c. couesi_ (p. 31). In the Chicago Natural History Museum we can find only one specimen. It is a young male, skull with skin, in which the last molar has not yet erupted, and bears the catalogue number 13654. It is, in our opinion, referable to _O. c. mexicanus_. Because we suspect that Goldman (_op. cit._) by error listed this one specimen twice (once under _O. c. couesi_ and once under _O. c. mexicanus_) it seems best to exclude Reforma, Oaxaca, from the geographic range of _O. c. couesi_.   ~Oryzomys alfaroi saturatior~ Merriam  A series of _Oryzomys alfaroi_ in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection obtained at Tumbala, 5000 ft., Chiapas, México, the type locality of _Oryzomys alfaroi saturatior_, contains individuals some of which Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 43:66, September 23, 1918) referred to the subspecies _O. a. saturatior_ and one which he referred to _O. a. palatinus_. This latter specimen, to judge from the external measurements given by Goldman (_loc. cit._), is No. 76328. In comparison with the other material which Goldman saw, we find the specimen to agree with _O. a. palatinus_ in pale color and posterior concavity of the posterior border of the palate. In some other diagnostic cranial characters, it is indistinguishable from specimens of _O. a. saturatior_ from the same locality, and in other characters, notably the slenderness of the rostrum, it is intermediate between the two subspecies concerned. In short, although we see the reasons for Goldman's subspecific identification of this individual, we think, in view of the structural intermediacy of the animal and the characters of the series _en masse_, that it is best referred to _Oryzomys alfaroi saturatior_.   ~Zapus princeps idahoensis~ Davis  Preble (N. Amer. Fauna, 15:23, August 8, 1899) referred two specimens from Henry House and three from 15 miles south of Henry House, both localities in Alberta, Canada, to the subspecies _Zapus princeps princeps_. Subsequently, when _Z. p. kootenayensis_ (Anderson, Nat. Mus. Canada, Ann. Rept. 1931, p. 108, November 24, 1932) and _Z. p. idahoensis_ (Davis, Jour. Mamm., 15(3):221, August 10, 1934) were named, no mention was made of these specimens although the ranges assigned to _Z. p. kootenayensis_ and _Z. p. idahoensis_ seemed to isolate the Henry House area from the remainder of the range (as recorded) of _Z. p. princeps_. We have examined the pertinent specimens in the U. S. Biological Surveys Collection (75452 and 75453 from Henry House; 81509-81510 from 15 mi. S Henry House). On the basis of paler color, reduced lateral line, smaller skull, shorter palatal bridge and zygomatic arches, they are, among named subspecies, best referred to _Zapus princeps idahoensis_.  _Transmitted July 30, 1952._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],["title","Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  MAORI and SETTLER  A STORY OF THE NEW ZEALAND WAR  BY G.

HENTY   Author of \"Redskin and Cowboy\" \"In Freedom's Cause\"  \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" &c.   _ILLUSTRATED_   BLACKIE AND SON LIMITED  LONDON GLASGOW AND BOMBAY  _Printed in Great Britain_   PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION   In the following story I have made no attempt to give anything like a general history of the long struggle between the brave tribes of New Zealand and the forces of England and the colony. That struggle lasted over a period of some years, and to do justice to its numerous incidents in the course of a single volume would have left no space whatever available for the telling of a story. It was divided into two distinct epochs. In the first the natives of the north of the islands fought for their independence and their right to have a king, and be governed by their own laws. Nothing could exceed the courage with which they struggled for these ends, and it needed a very strong force of British troops to storm their pahs or fortified camps, and overcome their resistance. The second epoch embraces the struggle brought about by the conversion of a portion of the tribes to the fanatical belief called the Pai Marire (literally \"good and peaceful\"), whose votaries were generally known as the Hau-Haus. During the earlier war the natives behaved with great moderation, and there were but few cases of the murder of outlying settlers. The slaying of all whites was, however, the leading feature of the Hau-Hau religion, and many cold-blooded massacres occurred during the struggle. The British troops had been for the most part withdrawn before the commencement of the Hau-Hau troubles, and the war was carried on by bodies of constabulary raised by the colonists, and with the aid of tribes that remained friendly to us. The massacre of Poverty Bay, which forms the leading feature of my story, and the events that followed it, are all strictly in accordance with facts.  G.A. HENTY     CONTENTS.

CHAPTER I.  A HOME BROKEN UP.   \"Well, mother, one thing is certain--something has got to be done. It is no use crying over spilt milk, that I can see. It is a horribly bad business, but grieving over it won't make it any better. What one has got to do is to decide on some plan or other, and then set to work to carry it out.\"  The speaker, Wilfrid Renshaw, was a boy between fifteen and sixteen years old. He was standing with his back to an empty fireplace, his feet well apart, his hands deep in his pockets. He was rather short for his age, but very squarely built. His hair was dark, cut rather short, and so ruffled over his head that there were no signs of a parting; his eyebrows were heavy, his eyes bright but rather deeply set; his chin was square and his jaw heavy; his nose was a little upturned, and this together with his eyes gave a merry expression to a face that would otherwise have been heavy and stern.  At school Wilfrid Renshaw had been regarded as rather a queer fellow. He was full of quiet fun, and saw a humorous side in everything. He did not take a very leading part in the various school sports, though there was a general idea that if Renshaw only chose to exert himself he could excel in any of them. In point of actual strength, although there were several boys in the school older than himself, it was generally admitted that he was by far the strongest there. But he always went his own way and always knew his own mind, and when he had once given his decision every one knew that it was of no use attempting to alter it; indeed, his reputation for obstinacy was so great that when he had once said \"I won't\" or \"I will,\" no one ever attempted to argue with him.  He was given to long walks and to collecting insects or flowers. He could never be persuaded to make one of the cricket eleven; but in winter, when there was little scope for his favourite pursuit, he threw himself into football; and although he absolutely refused to accept the captaincy when unanimously elected to that honour, he was considered by far the most valuable member of the team. He was scarcely popular among the boys of his own age; for although his fun and general good temper were appreciated by them, his determination to go his own way, and his entire disregard for the opinion of others, caused him to be considered an unsociable sort of fellow, an impression increased by the fact that he had no particular chums.  Among the smaller boys he was greatly liked. He would never allow any bullying when he was present; and although his interference was often resented by some of the elders, his reputation for strength and obstinacy was so great that he had never been called upon to take active measures to support his decisively expressed opinions. His father lived in a pretty house a quarter of a mile outside Reading; and as Wilfrid attended the grammar-school there, he was much more free to indulge his own tastes and go his own way than if he had been in a boarding-school. His chief companion in his rambles was his only sister Marion, who was a year his senior, although strangers would not have taken her to be so, either from her appearance or manner. She had an active lithe figure, and was able to keep up with him even during his longest excursions. They were in fact great chums and allies, and Marion would have indignantly scouted the idea had anyone suggested to her that her brother was either obstinate or unsociable.  Mr. Renshaw had been intended for the bar, and had indeed been called to that profession; but shortly afterwards he came into a fortune at the death of his father, and at once abandoned all idea of practising. After travelling for a few years on the Continent and in the East, he married and settled down near Reading. His time was for the most part devoted to archæology. He had a rare collection of ancient British, Saxon, and Norman arms, ornaments, and remains of all sorts; had written several books on the antiquities of Berkshire and Oxfordshire; was an authority upon tumuli and stone weapons; and was regarded by his acquaintances as a man of much learning.  The management of the house and children, and indeed of all affairs unconnected with his favourite hobby, he left to his wife, who was, fortunately for him, a clear-headed and sensible woman. Mr. Renshaw was, in fact, an eminently impractical man, weak and easy in disposition, averse to exertion of any kind, and without a shadow of the decision of character that distinguished his son. Except when away upon antiquarian excursions he passed his time entirely in his own study, engaged upon a work which, he anticipated, would gain for him a very high position among the antiquarians of the country, the subject being the exact spot at which Julius Cæsar landed in Britain.  He made his appearance only at meal-times, and then paid but little attention to what was going on around "]]]
