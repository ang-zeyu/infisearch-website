It is also the one we were given when the Galactic League first came here. It is the only one we were given.\"  \"Take it or leave it, eh?\"  \"I'm afraid so, Mayhem.\"  \"All right. All right, I guess I shouldn't complain. It could probably outrun and outfight and outthink the dyspeptic old Sirian gentleman, and things turned out well enough on Sirius III. But it'll probably take most of my time just getting used to it, Kovandaswamy. I'm supposed to be conducting an investigation.\"  \"At least as an Ophiuchan you won't arouse suspicion.\"  Mayhem nodded slowly, with reluctance. There was nothing else to say. He shook hands with Kovandaswamy and, wearing the loin cloth and the shawl, left the Galactic League building.  With, of course, a completely new identity.  Mayhem walked a mile and a half through hot, arid country. The League building was isolated, as if its inmates might contaminate the native Ophiuchans. Along the dusty road Mayhem passed a _guru_, the name for a wise man or a holy man first in India and now here on Ophiuchus IX. The guru sat in contemplation of the tip of his nose, legs crossed, soles of feet up, eyes half-closed. The guru remained that way, without moving, until Mayhem was out of sight. Then the guru behaved in a very un-guru-like manner.  The guru got up quite nimbly, joints creaking, skin dry and cracked. Three strides brought him to a tree with a partly hollow trunk. He lifted a radio transmitter and began to talk.         *       *       *       *       *  In twenty generations, the initially small population of Ophiuchus IX, all colonists from India on Earth, had increased geometrically. The colonized planet, now, was as over-populated as the teeming sub-continent which long ago had sent the colonists seeking a new home. As a result, unemployment was chronic, discontent widespread, and whatever inner serenity mysticism might bring was widely sought after. This did not stop the non-mystics, however, of whom there were many, from seeking jobs that could pay money that could fill empty bellies....  [Illustration: The crazed mob was bent upon rapine and murder.]  A long line gathered outside the employment office of Denebian Exports the morning after Mayhem had left the League building in his new body. Denebian Exports was the largest outworld company currently on Ophiuchus, a company which had solved the outworlder-suicide problem quite simply by hiring no one but natives. Still, hoots and catcalls surrounded those on the employment line. Other jobless Ophiuchans, apparently preferring near-starvation to working for the outworlders, threatened to make the situation dangerous.  Pandit Gandhi Menon, a lean, handsome Ophiuchan of perhaps thirty years, wished there was some way he could shut his ears to the abuse. He needed work. His father and mother were ill, his child was starving, his wife already dead. The gurus offered their own unique solution, of course. The body is nothing, they said. The mind is everything. But thus had the gurus spoken for four thousand years, on Earth and on Ophiuchus. The great majority of Ophiuchans, Pandit Gandhi Menon included, preferred food for the body to food for mystic thought. Still, the crowds were ugly, threatening to break up the line of job-seekers if Denebian Exports didn't open its doors soon....  An unkempt little man, not old but with a matted growth of beard, an unwashed body which gave the impression of wiry strength, and wild eyes, abruptly flung himself at the young woman in line in front of Pandit.  Shouting, \"Not our women, too!\" the little man attacked the girl, trying to drag her from the line. \"It is bad enough our men, but not our women!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pandit caught the fanatic's wiry arm and brought it behind his scrawny back in a hammerlock. \"Leave her alone,\" he said. \"If you try that again, I'll break your arm.\"  The fanatic looked at Pandit with hate in his eyes, but stepped back and stood to one side mouthing invective.  The girl, who was about twenty-five years old, had a livid mark on her arm. She wore loin cloth and shawl, the usual garb. She was, Pandit observed for the first time, quite pretty.  \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I--I'm not sure I like working for the outworlders. But I need the money.\"  \"Don't we all,\" Pandit told her. \"But we're not hired yet. I am Pandit Gandhi Menon.\"  \"Sria Krishna,\" the girl said, smiling at him. \"What sort of work is it?\"  \"Don't you know, Sria Krishna?\"  The girl shook her head and Pandit said: \"Actually, I guess I don't know, either. But there are rumors the outworlders want jet-pilots. Not for rocketry. For jets. To fly to the Empty Places.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The Empty Places? Why?\"  Pandit shrugged. \"Because they are empty, perhaps. Because they are too dry and too arid to support life. Because Denebian Export can claim whatever it found there, for free export. So go the rumors. But surely you can't pilot a jet.\"  \"Can you?\"  \"Yes,\" Pandit said promptly with a faint show of pride.  \"My father taught me. I want to thank you for what--\"  \"Nothing. Anyone in my position would have done it. This rabble--\"  The rabble was still noisy. Occasionally they hurled offal at the stragglers joining the rear of the long line. But Pandit and Sria Krishna stood in the forefront, and presently the door opened. In a few minutes Pandit watched the girl disappear inside. He waited nervously, licking dry lips with a parched tongue. It was early morning, but already very hot. He needed the work. Any work. He needed the money which outworlders could pay so abundantly for honest work. He wondered if the fanatic gurus ever thought of that. Then the door in front of him opened again and a fat, unctuous-looking Ophiuchan came out. He seemed to be an official of sorts.  \"One more!\" he said. \"Only one! The rest of you begone.\"  Behind Pandit there was a general press of bodies, but he was first in line and did not surrender his position. The unctuous-looking man admitted him, half-expecting a bribe. Pandit passed him by; he didn't have a single copper.  He approached a desk. The crowd noise outside was loud, those who had not joined the line crowing because most of those on it had been turned away. Behind the desk sat a small Denebian man of middle years. He looked nervous.  \"Can you fly?\" he asked in a voice almost desperately thin.  \"Yes,\" Pandit said. Then the rumors were right.  \"How much experience?\"  \"Five years on and off.\"  \"You have a license?\"  \"There are no licenses on Ophiuchus IX,\" Pandit pointed out.  \"Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Habit. You people don't lie.\"  \"We try not to.\"  \"Your name?\"  Pandit told him. The Denebian wrote it down on a form and said: \"You'll do. Pay is twenty credits a mission.\" It wasn't much, but it was more than Pandit had expected.  \"What do we fly?\" he asked. Questions didn't seem welcome, but no harm trying.         *       *       *       *       *  The Denebian looked at him and laughed. \"You want the job?\"  \"Yes, I want the job.\"  \"Then don't ask questions.\"  Pandit nodded.  \"Out through that door, then. The other new pilots are assembling.\"  And Pandit left the small office.  A moment later a buzzer sounded on the Denebian's desk. He spoke into a grid: \"Orkap here. Go ahead.\"  \"The guru near the League building reports that a native Ophiuchan left the building heading for the city.\"  \"When was this?\"  \"Yesterday morning.\"  \"And?\"  \"Draw your own conclusions. Natives don't go near the League headquarters as a rule, do they?\"  \"No.\"  \"And the League, of course, will want to know about the suicides?\"  \"Yes, but--\"  \"But nothing,\" said the radio voice, which belonged to the only other Denebian currently on Ophiuchus IX. \"We can assume this native is a spy. For the League, Orkap.\"  \"All right. I don't see any need to worry, though.\"  \"Don't you? The gurus, like the other natives, can sham, but they can't lie. Sooner or later a guru will be brought out of trance by the League, questioned, and--\"  \"Tell them about us?\" Orkap asked in a shocked voice.  \"It could happen. Maybe it's happened already. There won't be any proof, of course, but the League would send a spy. Suppose I describe this native to you.\"  Orkap said, \"Go ahead,\" and the radio voice did so.  In a shocked voice Orkap admitted: \"I've given that Ophiuchan a pilot's job this morning. There can't be any doubt about it.\"  \"Ah, then you see? You see?\"  \"I can fix that. I can--\"  \"Orkap, Orkap. You'll do nothing now. Let the spy alone for now. Then, in the Empty Places, you will merely announce to the pilots that there is a spy among them. Don't reveal who it is.\" He could not believe his ears.  \"But--\"  \"They want work. They need work. They'll all be afraid the finger of guilt may point at them. They'll work like dogs for you, and I wouldn't be surprised if they uncovered the spy themselves.\"  \"Yes,\" Orkap said. \"Yes, I understand.\"  \"All but one thing, Orkap. There is one thing you don't understand. The spy's identity--\"  \"You already told me who the spy was.\"  \"Yes. But there is another spy. Working for us, in the League building.\"  \"I never knew,\" said Orkap.  \"The spy among your pilots is more than appearance indicates. Did you ever hear of Johnny Mayhem?\"  Orkap's heart jumped into his throat. Who in the galaxy hadn't heard of Mayhem? \"But,\" he gasped, \"a--\"  \"Nevertheless. It is Mayhem.\"  Orkap was suddenly afraid, more afraid than he had ever been in his life. The ubiquitous Mayhem.         *       *       *       *       *  The fierce white sun of Ophiuchus IX broiled down on the Empty Places, a featureless desert two-thousand miles across and as lividly white as bleached bone. In all that burning emptiness, the jet cargo craft looked very "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32827"],["title","Think Yourself to Death (#2)"],["body","and very insignificant, like black midges on the dead white sand.  Midges among midges, the new pilots walked.  One said: \"But I see no cargo.\"  Another: \"These outworlders and their mystery....\"  All were sweating, all uncomfortable, but all grateful for the twenty credits a flight they would earn, whatever the cargo turned out to be.  \"What do you think?\" Pandit asked Sria.  \"I think I've never been so hot in my life. I feel like I'm being broiled alive.\"  \"Here comes the Denebian now.\"  They had been driven into the Empty Places in a sand sled. The trip had taken two days but because the sled was air-conditioned no one had objected. When they saw the half dozen jets they knew why a sled had taken them into the wilderness. The jets were small cargo-carriers with room for pilot, co-pilot and perhaps a ton of cargo in each. Whatever it was the Denebians wanted exported, it didn't take up much room.  Orkap of Deneb walked toward them past the first of the jets. He began without preamble: \"Your cargo is packed and ready to be moved in an underground vault five hundred yards from here. You will break up into pairs, a pilot and co-pilot for each jet.\" Sria Krishna and Pandit had already paired themselves together. \"You work on your own time, getting the cargo with trundle-sleds, loading it, taking off, delivering it to the Denebian freighter at the spaceport. When you are finished, you collect your pay.\"  \"Where do we sleep?\" someone asked.         *       *       *       *       *  Orkap smiled. \"You didn't come out here to sleep. There is only a limited amount of cargo. The jets are swift. You will be paid according to the amount of work you do. Any other questions?\"  \"What about food?\" a plump young Ophiuchan asked.  \"You will be given energy tablets, as many as you wish. Any other questions? No? Good. I have two additional things to say. First, you are not to examine your cargo under any circumstances, either here, or in transit, or on the spacefield. There are televid pick-up units in each jet, so you will be watched at all times. Second--\" Orkap paused and let the silence grow and spread across the dazzling white expanse--\"there is a spy among you, wearing the body of an Ophiuchan but in reality--well, I don't have to tell you who he is in reality.\" Orkap smiled grimly. \"There is only one body-changer in the galaxy, but one is quite enough.\"  One of the pilots said, a little breathlessly: \"Johnny Mayhem!\"  Orkap smiled again. \"I am aware of Mayhem's identity,\" he said, \"but I'm not going to do anything about it.\"  The pilots waited. The sun glared down balefully. \"You see,\" Orkap told them, \"we cannot be altogether sure that the rest of you are here simply to earn your twenty credits a flight. Mayhem has unwittingly become our insurance. Find Mayhem! Find the spy among you! A hundred credits bonus to the man who does!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pandit looked at Sria, who whistled. The girl said: \"If they think we can finish the job without sleep, picking up cargo and flying it to the spaceport and returning for more, then a hundred credits is probably more than any of us will earn. They'll all be looking like hawks for this Mayhem.\"  \"And,\" Pandit agreed, \"if there's a native spy among them, he'd be afraid to show himself for fear they'll think he's Mayhem. Very clever of the Denebians.\"  \"... to work at once,\" Orkap was saying. He wore a blaster on his hip, the only weapon among them. They all trudged behind him through the burning, faceless sands. Soon they reached a depression from which the sand had been cleared, baring the white bedrock of the Empty Places. In the rock a square opening had been cut, shielded on each side from the shifting sands by an up-curving lip. A ramp led down into darkness.  \"You will find your cargo down there. Also enough trundle-sleds to go around,\" Orkap explained. \"The cargo is crated. The crates must remain intact. Is that understood?\"  It was understood.  Their sudden mutual suspicion a pall worse than the heat, the Ophiuchans descended the ramp. They needed the money or they wouldn't be here. The money meant more to them than anything: this was no time to be far-sighted. Yet one of them was a spy for the Galactic League--Johnny Mayhem.  One of them, but which?  Pandit made a quick estimate of the number of crates. They were stacked neatly against one wall, each about four feet by four by four. And from the size of them, a single crate would fill the cargo bay of each of the jets. Pandit made a rough estimate. Two dozen crates, perhaps. In the dim light it was hard to tell. Two dozen crates, six jets, twelve Ophiuchans. Four trips for each jet. A half hour to load, ten minutes to unload, an hour and a half by jet to the spacefield. Three hours and forty minutes, round trip. Say, four hours. Four times four, sixteen. Sixteen hours of steady work for eighty credits. No time for mystery or suspicion. Barely time for mistrust....  \"You, there!\" a voice called. \"What are you doing?\"  It was one of the other Ophiuchans, quite the biggest of the lot. Pandit had seen him outside and remembered his name. He was Raj Shiva, a tall, muscular, swarthy Ophiuchan, with small, alert, suspicious eyes and a livid scar alongside his jaw.  \"Nothing,\" Pandit said. \"Nothing.\"  \"No? The others are loading already. I'll be watching you.\"  For a hundred credits, Pandit thought furiously, but said nothing. Sria touched his shoulder. \"I have one of the trundle-sleds,\" she said. \"Let's get about it.\"  \"Right,\" said Pandit.  Raj Shiva watched them a few moments longer, then drifted away with his own partner. It took Pandit and Sria, sweating copiously in the tremendous heat, a few minutes less than half an hour to load one of the crates aboard their jet. Three of the other ships were already airborne, whining away toward the spacefield.  Pandit looked at the crate. There were no markings on it anywhere. The wood looked new, but that meant absolutely nothing. In the dry heat of the Empty Places, wood would last a century, a millennium. They could not tell how old it was.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Ready?\" Sria Krishna called from the controls.  Pandit had secured the crate in the cargo bay. \"Ready,\" he responded.  Moments later acceleration thrust them back in the twin pilot seats.  Sria leveled the jet at twenty thousand and they sped at eight hundred miles an hour toward the city and the spacefield just beyond it.  \"Do you wonder about it?\" Sria asked after a while.  \"About what?\"  \"The cargo.\"  \"We aren't supposed to.\"  \"I know.\" Sria laughed. \"I'm a woman, you see.\"  Pandit grinned at her. \"Curiosity,\" he said. \"A woman's trait on any world.\"  Sria got up from the pilot chair but Pandit placed his hand on her shoulder and gently shoved her down again. \"They have a televid unit aboard,\" he said, \"remember?\"  Sria nodded. The jet sped on.  They landed at the spacefield. They were the fourth jet down and one of the other three had taken off on the return leg of the flight. A Denebian Pandit had never seen before was supervising the loin-cloth garbed laborers loading the crates aboard a Denebian spaceship. With Sria he delivered their crate on the trundle-sled, returned with the sled to their jet, and took off.         *       *       *       *       *  Just short of four hours from the time they started they returned to the Empty Places. They had gained a little time and were the second team down. From the jet ahead of them, Raj Shiva led a puny, middle-aged co-pilot.  Orkap stood in the underground storage room. Looking at his wrist chrono he said to the four Ophiuchans who came down the ramp: \"You made fine time.\" Raj Shiva's puny companion said something, but Raj Shiva grabbed his arm and they began to load a second crate. Pandit and Sria loaded theirs in silence.  They made their second round trip in four hours exactly. It was completely dark when they returned to the Empty Places. Sria was worried they would overshoot the cargo point, but Pandit brought the little jet down within a few hundred yards of its takeoff point.  They could see nothing when they shut off the jet's running lights, except for the glow which came from the underground room. They reached it and went down the ramp. Pandit judged that half the crates were gone now. He took a quick tour of the dimly-lit room while Sria got the trundle-sled into position against one of the crates.  \"Nobody here,\" Pandit said in a whisper. \"The Denebian must be sleeping in the sand-sled.\"  \"Yes,\" Sria said a little breathlessly.  \"I was thinking--\"  \"What?\" Sria said. \"Don't stop.\"  \"If we wanted to examine one of the boxes, it would be suicide to open the one we take. But we could open one of them down here, see what it is, take another for ourselves--\"  \"You would do this?\" Sria asked him. \"Why?\"  Pandit shrugged. \"I have eyes,\" he said. \"Our gurus did not broadcast the death-wish to outworlders until the Denebians came. Then they started. Have the Denebians sold them on the idea?\"  \"I don't know,\" Sria said.  \"Well, let's assume they have. Why? Why would they do such a thing, Sria?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Let me get this straight, Pandit. First, you think the gurus actually are making the outworlders kill themselves?\"  \"Of course,\" Pandit said. \"It's mental suggestion, on a scale only our gurus are capable of. But don't you see, Sria, they wouldn't do it on their own. The gurus are dirty, careless about their bodies--but terribly arrogant. Left alone, they wouldn't think the outworlders important enough to be concerned over one way or another. They certainly wouldn't kill them.\"  \"Go on,\" Sria urged.  \"All right. The gurus have great knowledge of the mystical, but externally they're naive. Let's suppose someone came along--the Denebians in this case--and found something they wanted very badly on Ophiuchus. These crates here, Sria. What would they do? They'd go to the gurus and"]]]
