He fought, crazily, hopelessly, twisting his body in its bonds, thrashing his bound limbs wildly.  [Illustration: \"A shove sent his body scraping over the edge, and he plunged downward through dank darkness.\"]  He saw the dark, unmoved face of Chandra Dass, the brass lamp over his head, the red hangings. Then his head dangled over the opening, a shove sent his body scraping over the edge, and he plunged downward through dank darkness. With a splash he hit the icy water and went under. The heavy weight at his ankles dragged him irresistibly downward. Instinctively he held his breath as the water rushed upward around him.  His feet struck oozy bottom. His body swayed there, chained by the lead weight to the bottom. His lungs already were bursting to draw in air, slow fires seeming to creep through his breast as he held his breath.  Ennis knew that in a moment or two more he would inhale the strangling waters and die. The thought-picture of Ruth flashed across his despairing mind, wild with hopeless regret. He could no longer hold his breath, felt his muscles relaxing against his will, tasted the stinging salt water at the back of his nose.  Then it was a bursting confusion of swift sensations, the choking water in his nose and throat, the roaring in his ears. A scroll of flame unrolled slowly in his brain and a voice shouted there, \"You're dying!\" He felt dimly a plucking at his ankles.  Abruptly Ennis' dimming mind was aware that he now was shooting upward through the water. His head burst into open air and he choked, strangled and gasped, his tortured lungs gulping the damp, heavy air. He opened his eyes, and shook the water from them.  He was floating in the darkness at the surface of the water. Someone was floating beside him, supporting him. Ennis' chin bumped the other's shoulder, and he heard a familiar voice.  \"Easy, now,\" said Inspector Campbell. \"Wait till I cut your hands loose.\"  \"Campbell!\" Ennis choked. \"How did you get loose?\"  \"Never mind that now,\" the inspector answered. \"Don't make any noise, or they may hear us up there.\"  Ennis felt a knife-blade slashing the bonds at his wrists. Then, the inspector's arm helping him, he and his companion paddled weakly through the darkness under the rotting pier. They bumped against the slimy, moldering piles, threaded through them toward the side of the pier. The waves of the flooding tide washed them up and down as Campbell led the way.  They passed out from under the old pier into the comparative illumination of the stars. Looking back up, Ennis saw the long, black mass of the house of Chandra Dass, resting on the black pier, ruddy light glowing from window-cracks. He collided with something and found that Campbell had led toward a little floating dock where some skiffs were moored. They scrambled up onto it from the water, and lay panting for a few moments.  Campbell had something in his hand, a thin, razor-edged steel blade several inches long. Its hilt was an ordinary leather shoe-heel.  The inspector turned up one of his feet and Ennis saw that the heel was missing from that shoe. Carefully Campbell slid the steel blade beneath the shoe-sole, the heel-hilt sliding into place and seeming merely the innocent heel of the shoe.  \"So that's how you got loose down in the water!\" Ennis exclaimed, and the inspector nodded briefly.  \"That trick's done me good service before--even with your hands tied behind your back you can get out that knife and use it. It was touch and go, though, whether I could get it out and cut myself loose in the water in time enough to free you.\"  Ennis gripped the inspector's shoulder. \"Campbell, Ruth is in there! By heaven, we've found her and now we can get her out!\"  \"Right!\" said the officer grimly. \"We'll go around to the front and in two minutes we'll be in there with my men.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They climbed dripping to their feet, and hastened from the little floating dock up onto the shore, through the darkness to the cobbled street.  The shabbily disguised men of Inspector Campbell were not now in front of Chandra Dass' café, but lurking in the shadows across the street. They came running toward Campbell and Ennis.  \"All right, we're going in there,\" Campbell exclaimed in steely tones. \"Get Chandra Dass, whatever you do, but see that his prisoners are not harmed.\"  He snapped a word and one of the men handed pistols to him and to Ennis. Then they leaped toward the door of the Hindoo's café, from which still streamed ruddy light and the babel of many voices.  A kick from Inspector Campbell sent the door flying inward, and they burst in with guns gleaming wickedly in the ruddy light. Ennis' face was a quivering mask of desperate resolve.  The motley patrons jumped up with yells of alarm at their entrance. The hand of a Malay waiter jerked and a thrown knife thudded into the wall beside them. Ennis yelled as he saw Chandra Dass, his dark face startled, leaping back with his servants through the black curtains.  He and Campbell drove through the squealing patrons toward the back. The Malay who had thrown the knife rushed to bar the way, another dagger uplifted. Campbell's gun coughed and the Malay reeled and stumbled. The inspector and Ennis threw themselves at the black curtains--and were dashed back.  They tore aside the black folds. A dull steel door had been lowered behind them, barring the way to the back rooms. Ennis beat crazily upon it with his pistol-butt, but it remained immovable.  \"No use--we can't break that down!\" yelled Campbell, over the uproar. \"Outside, and around to the other end of the building!\"  They burst back out through that mad-house, into the dark of the street. They started along the side of the pier toward the river-end, edging forward on a narrow ledge but inches wide. As they reached the back of the building, Ennis shouted and pointed to dark figures at the end of the pier. There were two of them, lowering shapeless, wrapped forms over the end of the pier.  \"There they are!\" he cried. \"They've got their prisoners out there with them.\"  Campbell's pistol leveled, but Ennis swiftly struck it up. \"No, you might hit Ruth.\"  He and the inspector bounded forward along the pier. Fire streaked from the dark ahead and bullets thumped the rotting boards around them.  Suddenly the loud roar of an accelerated motor drowned out all other sounds. It came from the river at the pier's end.  Campbell and Ennis reached the end in time to see a long, powerful, gray motor-boat dash out into the black obscurity of the river, and roar eastward with gathering speed.  \"There they go--they're getting away!\" cried the agonized young American.  Inspector Campbell cupped his hands and shouted out into the darkness, \"River police, ahoy! Ahoy there!\"  He rasped to Ennis. \"The river police were to have a cutter here tonight. We can still catch them.\"  With swiftly rising roar of speeded motors, a big cutter drove in from the darkness. Its searchlight snapped on, bathing the two men on the pier in a blinding glare.  \"Ahoy, there!\" called a stentorian voice over the roar of the motors. \"Is that Inspector Campbell?\"  \"Yes. Come alongside,\" yelled the inspector, and as the big cutter shot close to the end of the pier, its reversing propellers churning the dark water to foam, Ennis and Campbell leaped.  They landed amid unseen men in the cockpit, and as he scrambled to his feet the inspector cried, \"Follow that boat that just went down-river. But no shooting!\"         *       *       *       *       *  With thunderous drumfire from its exhausts, the cutter jerked forward so rapidly that it almost threw them from their feet again. It shot out onto the bosom of the dark river that flowed like a black sea between the banks of scattered lights that were London.  The moving lights of yachts and barges coming up-river could be seen gliding in that darkness. The captain of the cutter barked an order and one of his three men, the one crouched at the searchlight, switched its powerful beam out over the waters ahead.  In a moment it picked up a distant gray spot racing eastward on the black river, leaving a white trail of foam.  \"There she is!\" bawled the man at the searchlight. \"She's running without lights!\"  \"Keep her in the searchlight,\" ordered the captain. \"Sound our siren, and give the cutter her head.\"  Swaying, rocking, the cutter roared on through the darkness on the trail of that distant fleeing speck. As they raced down Blackwall Reach, the distance between the two craft had already begun to lessen.  \"We're overtaking him!\" cried Campbell, clutching a stanchion and peering ahead against the rush of wind and spray. \"He must be making for whatever spot it is in England that is the center of the Brotherhood of the Door--but he'll never reach it.\"  \"He said that within a few hours Ruth would go with the others through the Door!\" cried Ennis, clinging beside him. \"Campbell, we mustn't let them get away now!\"  Pursuers and pursued flashed on down the dark, broadening river, through mazes of shipping, the cutter hanging doggedly to the motor-boat's trail. The lights of London had dropped behind and those of Tilbury now gleamed away on their left.  Bigger, stronger waves now tossed and pounded the cutter as it raced out of the river mouth toward the heaving black expanse of the sea. The Kent coast was a black blur on their right; the gray motor-boat followed it closely, grazing almost beneath the Sheerness lights.  \"He's heading to round North Foreland and follow the coast south to Ramsgate or Dover,\" the cutter captain cried to Campbell. \"But we'll catch him before he passes Margate.\"  The quarry was now but a quarter-mile ahead. Steadily as they roared onward the gap narrowed, until in the glare of the searchlight they could make out every detail of the powerful gray motor-boat plunging through the tossing black waves.  They saw Chandra Dass' dark face turn and look back at them, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32847"],["title","The Door into Infinity (#3)"],["body"," cutter captain raised his speaking-trumpet to his lips and shouted over the roar of motors and dash of waves.  \"Stand by or we'll fire at you!\"  \"He won't obey,\" muttered Campbell between his teeth. \"He knows we daren't fire with the girl in the boat.\"  \"Yes, blast him!\" exclaimed the captain. \"But we'll have him in a few minutes, anyway.\"  The thundering chase had brought them into sight of the lights of Margate on the dark coast to their right. Now only a few hundred feet of black water separated them from the fleeing craft.  Ennis and the inspector, gripping the stanchions of the rushing cutter, saw a white figure suddenly stand erect in the boat ahead and wave its arms to them. The gray motor-boat slowed.  \"It's Chandra Dass and he's signaling that he's giving up!\" Ennis cried. \"He's stopping!\"  \"By heavens, he is!\" Campbell explained. \"Drive alongside him, and we'll soon have the irons on him.\"  The cutter, its own motors hastily throttled down, shot through the water toward the slowing gray craft. Ennis saw Chandra Dass standing erect, awaiting their coming, he and the two Malays beside him holding their hands in the air. He saw a half-dozen or more white-wrapped forms in the bottom of the boat, lying motionless.  \"There are their prisoners!\" he cried. \"Bring the boat closer so we can jump in!\"  He and Campbell, their pistols out, hunched to jump as the cutter drove closer to the gray motor-boat. The sides of the two craft bumped, the motors of both idling noisily. Then before Ennis and Campbell could jump into the motor-boat, things happened with cinema-like rapidity. Two of the still white forms at the bottom of the motor-boat leaped up and like suddenly uncoiled springs shot through the air into the cutter. They were two other Malays, their dark faces flaming with fanatic light, keen daggers glinting in their upraised hands.  \"'Ware a trick!\" yelled Campbell. His gun barked, but the bullet missed and a dagger slit his sleeve.  The Malays, with wild, screeching yells, were laying about them with their daggers in the cutter, insanely.  \"God in heaven, they're running amok!\" choked the cutter captain.  His slashed neck spurting blood and his face livid, he fell. One of his men slumped coughing beside him, another victim of the crazy daggers.     _3. Up the Water-Tunnel_   The man at the searchlight sprang for the maddened Malays, tugging at his pistol as he jumped. Before he got the weapon out, a dagger slashed his jugular and he went down gurgling in death. One of the Malays meanwhile had knocked Inspector Campbell from his feet, his knife-hand swooping down, his eyes blazing.  Ennis' gun roared and the bullet hit the Malay between the eyes. But as he slumped limply, the other fanatic was upon Ennis from the side. Before Ennis could whirl to meet him, the attacker's knife grazed down past his cheek like a brand of living fire. He was borne backward by the rush, felt the hot breath of the crazed Malay in his face, the dagger-point at his throat.  Shots roared quickly, one after another, and with each shot the Malay pressing Ennis back jerked convulsively. With the light of murderous madness fading from his eyes, he still strove to drive the dagger home into the American's throat. But a hand jerked him back and he lay prostrate and still.  Ennis scrambled up to find Inspector Campbell, pale and determined, over him. The detective had shot the attacker from behind.  The captain of the cutter and two of his men lay dead in the cockpit beside the two Malays. The remaining seaman, the helmsman, held his shoulder and groaned.  Ennis whirled. The motor-boat of Chandra Dass was no longer beside the cutter, and there was no sight of it anywhere on the black sea ahead. The Hindoo had taken advantage of the fight to make good his escape with his two other servants and their prisoners.  \"Campbell, he's gone!\" cried the young American frantically. \"He's got away!\"  The inspector's eyes were bright with cold flame of anger. \"Yes, Chandra Dass sacrificed these two Malays to hold us up long enough for him to escape.\"  Campbell whirled to the helmsman. \"You're not badly hurt?\"  \"Only a scratch, but I nearly broke my shoulder when I fell,\" answered the man.  \"Then head on around North Foreland!\" Campbell cried. \"We may still be able to catch up to them.\"  \"But Captain Wilson and the others are killed,\" protested the helmsman. \"I've got to report----\"  \"You can report later,\" rasped the inspector. \"Do as I say--I'll be responsible.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said the helmsman, and jumped back to the wheel.  In a minute the big cutter was roaring ahead over the heaving black waves, its searchlight clawing the darkness ahead. There was no sign now of the craft of Chandra Dass ahead. They raced abreast of the lights of Margate, started rounding the North Foreland, pounded by bigger seas.  Inspector Campbell had dragged the bodies of the dead policemen and their two slayers down into the cabin of the cutter. He came up and crouched down with Ennis beside Sturt, the helmsman.  \"I found these on the two Malays,\" Campbell shouted to the American, holding out two little objects in his spray-wet hand.  Each was a flat star of gray metal in which was set a large oval, cabochon-cut jewel. The jewels flashed and dazzled with deep color, but it was a color wholly unfamiliar and alien to their eyes.  \"They're not any color we know on earth,\" Campbell shouted. \"I believe these jewels came from somewhere beyond the Door, and that these are badges of the Brotherhood of the Door.\"  Sturt, the helmsman, leaned toward the inspector. \"We've rounded North Foreland, sir,\" he cried. \"Head straight south along the coast,\" Campbell ordered. \"Chandra Dass must have gone this way. No doubt he thinks he's shaken us off, and is making for the gathering-place of the Brotherhood, wherever that may be.\"  \"The cutter isn't built for seas like this,\" Sturt said, shaking his head. \"But I'll do it.\"  They were now following the coast southward, the lights of Ramsgate dropping back on their right. The waters out here in the Channel were wilder, great black waves tossing the cutter to the sky one moment, and then dropping it sickeningly the next. Frequently its screws raced loudly as they encountered no resistance but air.  Ennis, clinging precariously on the foredeck, turned the searchlight's stabbing white beam back and forth on the heaving dark sea ahead, but without any sign of their quarry disclosed.  White foam of breaking waves began to show around them like bared teeth, and there was a humming in the air.  \"Storm coming up the Channel,\" Sturt exclaimed. \"It'll do for us if it catches us out here.\"  \"We've got to keep on,\" Ennis told him desperately. \"We must come up with them soon!\"  The coast on their right was now one of black, rocky cliffs, towering all along the shore in a jagged, frowning wall against which the waves dashed foamy white. The cutter crept southward over the wild waters, tossed like a chip upon the great waves. Sturt was having a hard time holding the craft out from the rocks, and had its prow pointed obliquely away from them.  The humming in the air changed to a shrill whistling as the outrider winds of the storm came upon them. The cutter tossed still more wildly and black masses of water smashed in upon them from the darkness, dazing and drenching them.  Suddenly Ennis yelled, \"There's the lights of a boat ahead! There, moving in toward the cliffs!\"  He pointed ahead, and Campbell and the helmsman peered through the blinding spray and darkness. A pair of low lights were moving at high speed on the waters there, straight toward the towering black cliffs. Then they vanished suddenly from sight.  \"There must be a hidden opening or harbor of some kind in the cliffs!\" Inspector Campbell exclaimed. \"But that can't be Chandra Dass' boat, for it carried no lights.\"  \"It might be others of the Brotherhood going to the meeting-place!\" Ennis exclaimed. \"We can follow and see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sturt thrust his head through the flying spray and shouted, \"There are openings and water-caverns in plenty along these cliffs, but there's nothing in any of them.\"  \"We'll find out,\" Campbell said. \"Head straight toward the cliffs in there where that boat vanished.\"  \"If we can't find the opening we'll be smashed to flinders on those cliffs,\" Sturt warned.  \"I'm gambling that we'll find the opening,\" Campbell told him. \"Go ahead.\"  Sturt's face set stolidly and he said, \"Yes, sir.\"  He turned the prow of the cutter toward the cliffs. Instantly they dashed forward toward the rock walls with greatly increased speed, wild waves bearing them onward like charging stallions of the sea.  Hunched beside the helmsman, the searchlight stabbing the dark wildly as the cutter was flung forward by the waves, Ennis and the inspector watched as the cliffs loomed closer ahead. The brilliant white beam struck across the rushing, mountainous waves and showed only the towering barriers of rock, battered and smitten by the raving waters that frothed white. They could hear the booming thunder of the raging ocean striking the rock.  Like a projectile hurled by a giant hand, the cutter fairly flew now toward the cliffs. They now could see even the little streams that ran off the rough rock wall as each giant wave broke against it. They were almost upon it.  Sturt's face was deathly. \"I don't see any opening!\" he yelled. \"And we're going to hit in a moment!\"  \"To your left!\" screamed Inspector Campbell over the booming thunder. \"There's an arched opening there.\"  Now Ennis saw it also, a huge arch-like opening in the cliff that had been concealed by an angle of the wall. Sturt tried frantically to head the cutter toward it, but the wheel was useless as the great waves bore the craft along. Ennis saw they would strike a little to the side of the opening. The cliff loomed ahead, and he closed his eyes to the impact.  There was no impact. And as he heard a"]]]
