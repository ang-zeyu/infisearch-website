Osgood (1909) by comparison of one of Saussure's specimens with some from Mirador, Veracruz, concluded that _aztecus_ was a subspecies of _P. boylii_. Dalquest (1953) incorrectly reported specimens of _P. boylii_ from San Luis Potosí as _P. b. aztecus_. Merriam (1898) named _Peromyscus levipes_ from Mt. Malinche, Tlaxcala. Thomas (1903) described from Orizaba, Veracruz, _P. beatae_, which Osgood (1909) mistakenly thought was indistinguishable from _P. boylii levipes_. Therefore, Osgood in 1909 in his revision of the genus _Peromyscus_ reported only two subspecies of _P. boylii_ from eastern México: _P. b. levipes_, and _P. b. aztecus_. Study of Osgood's and Thomas' material, along with recently collected specimens from the states of eastern México, leads me to conclude that _P. aztecus_ and _P. boylii_ are different species; that _P. beatae_ is a valid subspecies different from _P. b. levipes_; and finally that specimens of _P. boylii_ from Nuevo León and northwestern Tamaulipas pertain to an hitherto unnamed subspecies.   #Peromyscus aztecus# Saussure      1860. _H[esperomys]. aztecus_ Saussure, Revue et Mag. Zool.,         Paris, ser. 2, 12:105, type from southern México, probably         from the vicinity of Mirador, Veracruz, according to Osgood         (N. Amer. Fauna, 28:156-157, April 17, 1909).      1909. _Peromyscus boylei aztecus_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,         28:156, April 17.      _Geographic distribution._--Known only from Mirador and Jalapa     in Veracruz, and Huachinango in Puebla.      _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the genus (see measurements); tail     about as long as head and body; dorsal coloration near Sayal     Brown (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, 1912); sides     reddish; underparts Light Buff; tail bicolored but not     distinctly so; supraorbital border of skull angular, and bullae     pointed anteriorly; anterior half of braincase nearly straight     (not rounded) as viewed from above; upper molar series long     (4.7-5.0); incisive foramina short in relation to length of     skull.      _Comparisons._--From _Peromyscus boylii_, _P. aztecus_ differs     as follows: Larger in most parts measured; maxillary tooth-row     4.7-5.0 instead of 4.0-4.6; color brighter on sides (reddish     instead of ochraceous); supraorbital border angular instead of     rounded; anterior border of zygomatic plate convex in upper half     and almost straight in lower half as opposed to nearly straight     throughout in _boylii_; pterygoid fossa broader; bullae more     pointed anteriorly and less inflated; mesostyles of upper molars     larger; surface between orbital region and nasals convex in     lateral view instead of flat.  _Remarks._--When Saussure (1860:105) described _P. aztecus_ he did not designate a type or type locality. Osgood (1909:157) designated as lectotype the mounted specimen, in the Geneva Museum, which has the skull inside and of which Saussure figured the molar teeth. Osgood (_loc. cit._) examined one of the three specimens (No. 3926 USNM) that Saussure used in describing _P. aztecus_ and found that it agreed \"in every respect with recently collected specimens from Mirador, Veracruz, which, in the lack of exact knowledge, may be assumed to be the type locality, as it is certain that some at least of Saussure's specimens were taken near there.\"  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Two species of _Peromyscus_.     1. _P. boylii ambiguus_     2. _P. boylii beatae_     3. _P. boylii levipes_     4. _P. aztecus_ (triangles)]  Osgood regarded _P. aztecus_ as a subspecies of _P. boylii_ because of the resemblance between _aztecus_ and _P. b. evides_, but _evides_ is far removed geographically (occurring only in western México) from _aztecus_, and is smaller. _P. aztecus_ is larger than any known subspecies of _P. boylii_, and is not known to intergrade with _P. b. levipes_ or _P. b. beatae_ (with which _aztecus_ occurs sympatrically at Jalapa, Veracruz), the two subspecies of _boylii_ that are found nearest the geographic range of _P. aztecus_. Also, as mentioned previously, _aztecus_ possesses distinctive characters that distinguish it from all subspecies of _boylii_. For these reasons I regard _aztecus_ as a distinct species.  According to Hall and Kelson (1959:634), _P. aztecus_ occurs in San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, and west-central Veracruz, but their map 364 is based on the records of Osgood (1909:158) and Dalquest (1953:143). I have examined all the specimens reported by the two authors last named and find that those from San Luis Potosí are _P. boylii levipes_.  The diagnosis and comparisons here presented of _aztecus_ were based on specimens from Mirador in comparison with all the specimens of _P. boylii_ from eastern México listed beyond. The largest specimens of _P. boylii_ that I have examined are from Las Vigas, Veracruz, and localities within a radius of five kilometers thereof. Some measurements of these large specimens of _P. boylii_ overlap those of _P. aztecus_ but the two kinds of mice differ greatly in characters of the skull, in color, and in length of tail.  The specimens (three adults and three juveniles) from Huachinango, Puebla, are slightly darker than specimens from Mirador but do not differ otherwise. Of two specimens reported from Jalapa, Veracruz, by Osgood (1909:158), one (108547 USNM) agrees with specimens from Mirador in color and cranial characteristics and is _P. aztecus_, whereas the other (108548 USNM) is _P. b. beatae_.      _Specimens examined._--Total 16 (all USNM) as follows: PUEBLA:     Huachinango, 6. VERACRUZ: Mirador, 9; Jalapa, 1.   #Peromyscus boylii levipes# Merriam      1898. _Peromyscus levipes_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc.         Washington, 12:123, April 30, type from Mt. Malinche, 8400         ft., Tlaxcala.      1909. _Peromyscus boylei levipes_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,         28:153, April 17.      _Geographic distribution._--Southeastern Tamaulipas and eastern     San Luis Potosí, south through the central states of México to     Guatemala.      _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; tail shorter or     longer than head and body (83-112.3%); color variable according     to locality but in general ochraceous, having some dusky on     upper parts; supraorbital border not angular, almost rounded;     auditory bullae large.      _Comparisons._--For comparisons see accounts of the subspecies     discussed beyond and Osgood (1909:145).  _Remarks._--A precise diagnosis for _P. b. levipes_ is difficult to prepare because some geographic variation in color and in the cranial characters is present within the range of the subspecies as here understood. For instance there is a gradual cline of decreasing size to the northward in nearly all measurements, but the ratio of length of tail to length of head and body does not present such a cline; mice from several localities in San Luis Potosí have a relatively shorter tail than do mice from farther north and from farther south. Also, specimens labeled in reference to Zacualpilla, Jacales, Jacala, Tulancingo, and San Miguel Regla average slightly darker dorsally than do typotypes. Some of these specimens are reddish on the cheek and lateral line. Specimens from San Luis Potosí resemble topotypes, but some specimens from northeastern localities in that state have cinnamon or brownish upper parts and are intermediate in coloration between populations of _levipes_ to the south and populations of the same subspecies to the north from the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra de Tamaulipas. Specimens from these two sierras have a cinnamon-reddish color that is more intense in specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas.  Osgood (1909:153) recorded _P. b. levipes_ as occurring from central Nuevo León south through San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, and Veracruz to southern Oaxaca. Actually specimens from Nuevo León and from most parts of Veracruz differ subspecifically from _levipes_ and also from each other. In Veracruz, _P. b. levipes_ is known only from the northwestern part.      _Specimens examined._--Total 179 as follows: TAMAULIPAS: Sierra     Madre Oriental, 5 mi. S, 3 mi.
