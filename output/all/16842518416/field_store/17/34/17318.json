Likewise, the glands are present or absent in either sex, and often as not they are present in juveniles. Presence of the glands, therefore, cannot be correlated either with sexual or ontogenetic development. Since the glands are found in individuals from all parts of the range, it is unlikely that there is a correlation between the development of the glands and the environment.  [Illustration: FIG. 7. Diagrammatic view of ventral surfaces of _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ (A) and _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ (B), showing usual position and size of glandular areas. Approx. natural size.]  Aside from the differences in the ventral glands, the call is different in the two populations. The call of _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ is a rather harsh \"wack, wack, wack\" as contrasted with the more nasal \"woink, woink, woink\" of _melanonotus_. Sound spectrographs are needed to analyze the differences in calls. None of the specimens of _occidentalis_ examined approaches in size the largest individuals of _melanonotus_; possibly the size of the frogs is another valid character for separating the species. On the basis of the above data it is evident that the frogs in northwestern México show certain characters that distinguish them from _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, as it is known throughout the rest of México. It is not known for certain that _melanonotus_ and _occidentalis_ are sympatric. Several series of old, poorly preserved specimens from Nayarit and Sinaloa cannot be placed in either species, for none has visible ventral glands. _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ is known from Acaponeta, Nayarit (AMNH 43913-25), and the following localities in Jalisco: Barro de Navidad (UMMZ 118098), La Concepción (UMMZ 113081), La Resolana (UMMZ 102104), and Tenachitlán (UMMZ 113045-6). Records for _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ are: Álamos, Sonora (AMNH 51356-65); Culiacán (AMNH 49511-9), Chele (UMMZ 110914), and Rosario (UMMZ 113062) in Sinaloa; Ixtlán del Río (UMMZ 102108), San Blas (UMMZ 112814, 112994, 110892, 115543), and Tepic (UMMZ 115544) in Nayarit; Ameca (UMMZ 102106-7) and La Cofradía on the south shore of Lago de Chapala (UMMZ 102105) in Jalisco; and Tangamandapio, Michoacán (UMMZ 119145). From these scattered records it appears that _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ in the southern part of its range stays in the uplands, whereas _melanonotus_ is confined to the lowlands.   ~Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi~ (Taylor)       _Eleutherodactylus hobartsmithi_ Taylor, Trans. Kansas Acad.      Sci., 39:355, 1937.--Uruapan, Michoacán, México.       _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci.      Bull., 26:501, November 27, 1940.       Cascada Tzararacua (6); 21 km. W of Ciudad Hidalgo; 29 km. E      of Morelia; Puerto Hondo; San José de la Cumbre (13);      Uruapan (2); Zitácuaro.  Of six specimens from Cascada Tzararacua, five are colored like typical _M. hobartsmithi_, having the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs and the upper arms pale pink in life and a grayish brown dorsum in preservative. The other specimen (UMMZ 94231) has in preservative a dark brown dorsolateral line on each side enclosing a pale tan area that extends from the snout to the vent. One specimen from 29 kilometers east of Morelia (UIMNH 40338) and 13 specimens from San José de la Cumbre (UMMZ 102111) do not have the prominent tarsal tubercles characteristic of _M. hobartsmithi_. Also, in these fourteen specimens the palmar tubercles are larger, and the dark anal patch more distinct, than in typical _M. hobartsmithi_. Possibly these specimens, which are from the high mountains in the eastern part of Michoacán, represent another species of _Microbatrachylus_. However, Taylor (1940d:501) reported a series of _M. hobartsmithi_ from the mountains 10 miles west of Villa Victoria in the western part of the state of México.  The largest specimen from Michoacán is a gravid female (UIMNH 16104) having a snout-vent length of 23.5 mm.  _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_ has been found in rocky ravines along streams in the Cordillera Volcánica and the southwestern escarpment of these mountains at elevations from 1450 to 2750 meters.   ~Microbatrachylus pygmaeus~ (Taylor)       _Eleutherodactylus pygmaeus_ Taylor, Trans. Kansas Acad.      Sci., 39:352, 1937.--1 mile north of Rodriguez Clara,      Veracruz, México.       _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci.

Bull.,      26:507, November 27, 1940.--Agua del Obispo, Guerrero,      México.       _Microbatrachylus imitator_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,      28:70, May 15, 1942.--La Esperanza, Chiapas, México.       Arteaga (328).  This large series (UMMZ 119247-8) was collected on June 22 and 23, 1958, before the onset of the heavy summer rains. The frogs were found in a shaded ravine at the north edge of Arteaga; they were obtained during the day, at which time they were actively moving about in the leaf litter along a small stream.  These frogs are all referred to _M. pygmaeus_, because this is the earliest name available for frogs showing the variation in characteristics displayed by this large series. The characters used by Taylor (1936a, 1940d, 1941a, and 1942b) and Smith and Taylor (1948) to distinguish the various species of _Microbatrachylus_ include color pattern, relative length of the hind limb, presence and position of dorsal dermal folds or pustules, relative size of inner and outer metatarsal tubercles, and the number of palmar tubercles. All specimens from Arteaga have two palmar tubercles; the inner and outer metatarsal tubercles are subequal in size. Furthermore, aside from sexual difference, there is little variation in the relative length of the hind limbs (Table 3). However, many color patterns do exist in the series; each of these color patterns is described below.

All are pustulate above; in most specimens the pustules form no pattern, but in some they tend to form a V in the scapular region.  B.--41 specimens: Dorsum pale tan or cream-color with brown mottling on flanks; a brown interorbital bar and a brown chevron in scapular region. Dorsum irregularly pustulate; in some specimens the pustules tend to form a V in the scapular region.  C.--12 specimens: Dorsum colored like \"A\", but having a broad yellow stripe narrowly bordered by black from the tip of the snout to the vent; in some specimens there is a narrow yellow stripe on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. The dorsum is irregularly pustulate.  D.--31 specimens: Dorsum variably streaked with cream-color or pale tan and brown; usually a broad cream-colored stripe from eyelid to groin bordered laterally by a somewhat narrower brown stripe; middorsal area cream-color and separated from dorsolateral cream-colored stripe by a brown stripe, or middorsal area brown with a cream-colored or yellow, narrow stripe from tip of snout to vent; a dark stripe from tympanum to flank; dorsal surfaces of heels creamy white to pale orange; anal patch brown. A dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump; another ridge extends posteromedially from the eyelid; scattered pustules on the dorsum in some specimens.  E.--17 specimens: A narrow dark stripe from snout, through nostril and eye, over tympanum, to vent, enclosing a unicolor dorsum (reddish tan to yellowish tan in life); heels pale tan or yellow above; anal patch black. A faint dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump, or part way to rump.  F.--2 specimens: Mottled brown and cream-color above; upper lips and upper arms white. A dermal fold from posterior edge of eyelid to rump; scattered pustules on dorsum.  Some of these color variants are assignable to names proposed by Taylor: \"A\" and \"B\" undoubtedly are _M. pygmaeus_ (Taylor, 1936a); \"C\" probably is _M. pygmaeus_; \"D\" is referable to _M. minimus_ (Taylor, 1940d) in most characteristics, although the coloration is more nearly like that of _M. lineatissimus_ (Taylor, 1941a), a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],["title","The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#8)"],["body"," species characterized by a relatively long hind limb; \"E\" apparently is _M. imitator_ (Taylor, 1942b); \"F\" is _M. albolabris_ (Taylor, 1940d). Examination of series of these frogs from other parts of México shows a similar composition of color variants. Of 78 specimens from the Río Sarabia and the village of Sarabia in Oaxaca (UMMZ 115428-37), 57 are \"A,\" six are \"D,\" three are \"E,\" and 12 are \"F\"; of 22 specimens from Teapa, Tabasco (UMMZ 113829), 11 are \"A,\" five are \"D,\" two are \"E,\" and four are \"F\"; of 33 specimens from Potrero Viejo, Veracruz (USNM 115447-58, 115461-71, 116840-2, 116864-70), ten are \"A,\" 13 are \"E,\" and ten are \"F\"; of 31 specimens from La Esperanza, Chiapas (USNM 115477-9, 116827-39, 116849-63), 28 are \"A\" and four are \"F.\"  It is highly doubtful if these color variants are actually distinct species. Goin (1950 and 1954) in his studies of inheritance of color pattern in West Indian species of the genus _Eleutherodactylus_ has shown that similar color pattern variants come from the same clutch of eggs; furthermore, Goin has worked out the genetic ratios of certain of these variants. Heathwole (_in litt._) obtained \"normal\" specimens and individuals having a broad middorsal stripe (\"C\" in figure 9) from a clutch of eggs of _Eleutherodactylus gollmeri_. The presence of a broad middorsal yellow stripe is common in _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of variability in color pattern in Mexican eleutherodactylids is the parallelism between members of the _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_-group and some members of _Microbatrachylus_. In the former group there are white-lipped individuals (_Eleutherodactylus beatae_ Boulenger), individuals having a unicolor reddish or yellowish dorsum (_E. dorsoconcolor_ Taylor), and individuals having a dorsal pattern of irregular longitudinal brown and cream-colored streaks (_E. venustus_ Günther). In the humid forests of southern Veracruz, northern Oaxaca, and Chiapas members of both groups occur sympatrically. A proper understanding of the evolutionary significance of these variants in the two groups, as well as proper allocation of the presently recognized species, must await experimental evidence based on studies of the inheritance of color pattern. Nevertheless, at present it is apparent that certain characters, especially the nature of the dermal folds and pustules, and the color pattern, are of little taxonomic value in distinguishing \"species\" of _Microbatrachylus_. The data derived from a study of the large series from Arteaga, together with that from the other series examined, suggests that _Microbatrachylus albolabris_, _imitator_, _minimus_, and _pygmaeus_ are morphotypes of one species. Of these names, _pygmaeus_ is the oldest. Consequently _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ has been used here for the series from Arteaga.  Although _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_, a species distinguished from all of the above by the presence of tubercles on the outer edge of the tarsus, is known from Michoacán northward into Nayarit, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ previously has not been known north of Guerrero, where it occurs in habitats similar to that in which it was collected at Arteaga.   ~Eleutherodactylus augusti cactorum~ Taylor       _Eleutherodactylus cactorum_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,      25:391, July 10, 1939.--20 miles northwest of Tehuacán,      Puebla, México.       _Eleutherodactylus augusti cactorum_, Zweifel, Amer. Mus.      Novitates, 1813:20, December 23, 1956.       Cherán; Coalcomán; Uruapan.  The few specimens indicate that this species occurs at moderate to high elevations in the state. The specimens from Cherán and Uruapan were obtained in pine forests; the specimen from Coalcomán was found on a rocky hillside covered with dense forest and located about 100 meters below the lower limits of the pine forest in the area. A specimen from Rancho Reparto (elevation 1850 meters) on the west slope of Cerro Barolosa was lost.  The specimen from Coalcomán (UMMZ 104728) is a juvenile having a snout-vent length of 25.0 mm. In life it was tan above, mottled with olive-green. The ventral surfaces were gray; the hind limbs were distinctly barred with yellow and brown, and the lips were barred with yellow and black.   ~Eleutherodactylus occidentalis~ Taylor       _Eleutherodactylus occidentalis_ Taylor, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 54:91, July 31, 1941.--Hacienda El Florencio,      Zacatecas, México.       Arteaga (2); Cascada Tzararacua; Coalcomán (2); 19 km. SW of      Coire (3); La Placita (7); Los Reyes; Ostula (4); Pómaro      (2).  The locality records for this species suggest that it is a member of a group of animals, the distribution of which includes the western part of the Mexican Plateau and the Pacific lowlands. In Michoacán this frog has been collected in pine-oak forest at Cascada Tzararacua and at Los Reyes, in arid scrub forest at Arteaga and Coalcomán, and in tropical semi-deciduous forest on the lower Pacific slopes of the Sierra de Coalcomán. On July 5, 1950, James Peters (1954:6) found calling males at La Placita.  Most of the specimens are immature; four adult males have snout-vent lengths of 30.9-33.0 (32.2) mm. In all specimens the first finger is noticeably longer than the second; the inner metatarsal tubercle is large, flat, and cream-colored, contrasting with the dark brown sole of the foot. When the hind limbs are adpressed, the heels broadly overlap. Characteristically, a dark line extends from the snout, through the eye, above the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of the forelimb. Usually there is a dark bar behind the tympanum, two dark brown bars from the eye to the mouth and thence onto the lower jaw, and another dark bar on the upper lip between the eye and nostril. One adult from Arteaga, an adult and a juvenile from La Placita, and one juvenile each from Coire, Ostula, and Pómaro, have the lower lip barred with dark brown and white, and have a white stripe extending the length of the upper lip. In life the dorsum varies from dark gray or olive-brown to tan or reddish brown.  This species belongs to a group containing two other populations that are currently recognized as species--_calcitrans_, known only from Omiltemi, Guerrero, and _mexicanus_, reported from the mountains of Oaxaca. Another apparently undescribed member of this group has been collected in the mountains of northern Puebla. The locality records indicate that the group inhabits the mountains on the periphery of the Mexican Plateau, except in western México, where _Eleutherodactylus occidentalis_ extends to the Pacific lowlands.   ~Eleutherodactylus rugulosus vocalis~ Taylor       _Eleutherodactylus vocalis_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,      26:401, November 27, 1940.--Hacienda El Sabino, Michoacán,      México.       Arteaga (10); El Sabino (8); Salitre de Estopilas (3);      Tumbiscatio (2); Tzitzio (2).  The distributional data on this frog in Michoacán indicate that it inhabits riparian situations in arroyos and canyons in the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcánica and the Sierra de Coalcomán, where it has been taken at elevations only below 1100 meters.  The dorsal color of living individuals from Arteaga varied from dark gray and olive brown to tan and reddish brown. The iris was grayish brown. In contrast, individuals from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, had pale golden eyes; specimens from Matías Romero, Oaxaca, had gold eyes heavily flecked with gray; and individuals from Volcán San Martin, Veracruz, had bronze eyes.  The use of the trinomial here is arbitrary. Frogs of the _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ group in México (_rugulosus_, _avocalis_, and _vocalis_) exhibit only slight differences in size, proportions, and coloration (Duellman, 1958c:6). Furthermore, the named populations are allopatric. _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus vocalis_, as defined by Duellman (_loc. cit._), occurs in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental and associated ranges from central Sinaloa southward into Michoacán.   ~Tomodactylus angustidigitorum~ Taylor       _Tomadactylus angustidigitorum_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci.      Bull., 26:494, November 27, 1940.--Quiroga, Michoacán,      México.       Angahuan (6); Apo; Carapan (21); 19 km. S of Carapan (13);      Cerro Tancítaro (12); Cherán; Corupu (14); Cuseño Station      (14); Opopeo (3); Paracho (11); Parícutin (2); Pátzcuaro      (3); Quiroga (59); San Juan de Parangaricutiro (16);      Tancítaro (25); Uruapan (8); Zacapu (11).  This species is indigenous to the pine-oak forests on the southern rim of the Mexican Plateau, and has been collected at elevations from 1500 to 2500 meters. Males have been observed to call from rocks, rock fences, clumps of grass, and low bushes; the call is a single \"peep.\" At San Juan de Parangaricutiro numerous specimens were found in the daytime beneath adobe bricks and lava on the volcanic ash derived from Volcán Parícutin; at Paracho individuals were found by day beneath rocks in a pine forest.  In most specimens the dorsum is dark reddish brown, and the prominent inguinal glands are cream-color or pale orange (Pl. 3, Fig. 1). Of eight individuals collected at Paracho, one was reddish brown, two were pinkish tan, three were dark brown, and two were black.   ~Tomodactylus fuscus~ Davis and Dixon       _Tomodactylus fuscus_ Davis and Dixon, Herpetologica,      11:157, July 15, 1955.--1.5 miles southeast of Huitzilac,      Morelos, México.       Los Cantiles (2); 28 km. E of Morelia.  The range of this species includes the Sierra Ajusco in México and Morelos and thence westward to the Serranía Ucareo in Michoacán. The specimen from 28 kilometers east of Morelia was found in an oak forest on a steep hillside at an elevation of 2100 meters. One from Los Cantiles was calling from a steep cliff at an elevation of 2200 meters in pine-oak forest. This specimen (UMMZ 119156) in life had a pale olive-brown dorsum with irregular dark brown mottling and"]]]
