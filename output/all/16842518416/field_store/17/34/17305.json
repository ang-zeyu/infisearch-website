N. Atlantic. For all species exploited by whaling industries' current maximum sizes will be substantially smaller than these figures (see species accounts).]     DIRECTORY TO SPECIES ACCOUNTS   LARGE WHALES  (40-85 feet [12-26 m] maximum overall length)   With a Dorsal Fin  All five species of large whales with a dorsal fin belong to the same major baleen whale group, the balaenopterid whales or rorquals. All are characterized by the presence of a series of ventral grooves, usually visible on stranded specimens and the length and number of which are diagnostic to species. In addition, all species, with the exception of the humpback whale, have at least one distinctive (though often not prominent) ridge along the head from just in front of the blowhole to near the tip of the snout. (The humpback whale, on the other hand, is distinguished by numerous knobs, some of which are located along the line of the head ridge, with others scattered on the top of the head.) In Bryde's whale, the single head ridge characteristic of the other rorquals is supplemented by two auxiliary ridges, one on each side of the main ridge.  At sea, these whales often appear very similar and must be examined carefully before they can be reliably identified.  In general, though the characteristics of behavior may vary from one encounter to the next, based on the activities in which the animal is engaged, whales in this group may be distinguished from each other on the basis of differences in 1) the size, shape, and position of the dorsal fin and the timing of its appearance on the surface relative to the animal's blow (in general, the larger the whale, the smaller the dorsal fin--the further back its position and the later its appearance on the surface after the animal's blow); 2) the height of body in the area of the dorsal fin, relative to the size of the dorsal fin, which is exposed as the animal sounds; 3) sometimes the blow rate and movement patterns; and 4) the shape and color of the head.  Despite variability in behavior by members of the same species from one encounter to the next, an observer can greatly increase the reliability of his identification by forming the habit of working systematically through a set of characteristics for the species rather than depending on any single characteristic.  [Sidenote: BLUE WHALE  _Balaenoptera musculus_  p. 19]    Body very large, up to 85 feet (25.9 m) long.[7]   Body basically bluish with mottlings of grayish white.   Baleen all black.   Head broad and nearly U-shaped, viewed from above.   Head flat in front of blowhole, viewed from side.   Dorsal fin small (to 13 inches [33 cm]), triangular to moderately     falcate, in the last one-third of back.   Distribution primarily from temperate seas to pack ice; rare in     tropics.   Distribution more northerly during summer.   Flukes occasionally raised slightly on long dive.  [Footnote 7: These figures are all near maximum sizes recorded for the North Atlantic. For all species which have historically been exploited by whale fisheries present maximum sizes may be significantly less than these figures.  It should also be noted that differences in methods of measurements often account for discrepancies in reported lengths.]  [Sidenote: FIN WHALE  _Balaenoptera physalus_  p. 26]    Body large, up to 79 feet (24 m) long.

Distribution at least New England to Iceland"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],["title","Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#5)"],["body"," Greenland during     summer.   Distribution to shallow tropical banks, winter and spring.   Flukes often scalloped on trailing edges and sometimes raised on     dive.  NOTE: Because of its small adult size, usually less than 30 feet (9.1 m), another member of the rorqual family, the minke whale, is included with the medium-sized whales in this guide. Features by which it may be distinguished from all other rorquals are discussed in the species account.  Further, inasmuch as the dorsal fin of the humpback whale is highly variable in shape, positive identification may require reference to the sperm whale (p. 57), which, though the sperm whale has been classified with species without dorsal fin, has a rather distinct dorsal hump, particularly noticeable when the animal arches the back and tail to begin a long dive.  [Illustration: Figure 8a.--Swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics of blue, fin, sei, and Bryde's whales.]  [Illustration: Figure 8b.--Swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics of humpback, bowhead, right, and sperm whales.]   (40-65 feet [12-20 m] maximum overall length)   Without a Dorsal Fin  There are three species of large whales without a dorsal fin in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Two of these, the bowhead or Greenland whale, and its more widely distributed close relative the right whale, are baleen whales. The third, the sperm whale, is a toothed whale. The first two have relatively smooth backs without even a trace of a dorsal fin. The sperm whale has a humplike low, thick, dorsal ridge, which, from certain views, particularly when the animal is humping up to begin a dive, may be clearly visible and look like a fin. But because the profile of that hump and the knuckles which follow it are often not very prominent in this species, it has been classified with the finless big whales.  All three species are characterized by very distinctive blows or spouts. In both the bowhead and the right whales, the projection of the blow upward from two widely separated blowholes assumes a very wide V-shape with two distinct columns, which may be seen when the animals are viewed from front or back. Though this character may be visible under ideal conditions in many of the other baleen whales species as well, it is exaggerated and uniformly distinct in the bowhead and right whales and may be used as one of the primary key characters. In the sperm whale, the blow emanates from a blowhole which is displaced to the left of the head near the front and projects obliquely forward to the animal's left. This blow seen under ideal conditions positively labels a large whale as a sperm whale.  Remember, however, that wind conditions may affect the disposition and duration of the blow of any species and that a single character alone is seldom sufficient to permit positive identification.  [Sidenote: BOWHEAD WHALE  _Balaena mysticetus_  p. 49]    Body to 65 feet (19.8 m) long.[8]   Body dark; back smooth.   Chin and belly often white.   Head lacks callosities.   Baleen dark gray with gray fringes; to 12 feet (3.7 m) or more.   Upper jaw and lower lip strongly arched.   Two blowholes clearly separated.   Blow projects upward in wide V-shape.   Distribution restricted to Arctic waters south to Davis Straits.   Flukes raised on longer dives.  [Footnote 8: These figures are near maximum sizes recorded for the North Atlantic. All three species have been heavily exploited by whale fisheries. Therefore maximum sizes today may be significantly less than these figures (see text).  It should also be noted that differences in methods of measurements often account for discrepancies in reported lengths.]  [Sidenote: RIGHT WHALE  _Eubalaena glacialis_  p. 52]    Body to 53 feet (16.2 m) long.   Body from dark to light gray and mottled; back smooth; chin and     belly usually white.   Head and lower jaw covered with callosities (the largest of which     is called the bonnet and is set on top of the snout).   Baleen usually dark gray with dark fringes; to 7.2 feet (2.2 m).     When animals swim, mouth agape, near surface; baleen sometimes     appears pale brownish to yellowish gray in color.   Upper jaw and lower lip strongly arched.   Two blowholes clearly separated.   Blow projects upward in wide V-shape.   Distribution extends from Iceland south at least to Florida and     reported from Texas.   Flukes raised on longer dives.  [Sidenote: SPERM WHALE  _Physeter catodon_  p. 57]    Body to 69 feet (20.9 m) long; males grow significantly larger     than females.   Body dark grayish brown to brown; wrinkled in appearance.   Back has rounded hump followed by knuckles.   Head boxlike, comprises up to 40% of body length.   From 18 to 25 functional teeth in each side of narrow lower jaw.   Single blowhole on left of head at front.   Blow projects forward obliquely from head and to left.   Distribution extends from tropics to Arctic; adult males     distributed farther north.   Flukes raised on longer dives.   MEDIUM-SIZED WHALES  (13-32 feet [4-10 m] maximum overall length)   With a Dorsal Fin  There are 11 species of medium-sized whales with a dorsal fin known from the western North Atlantic. These species, taking many diverse forms, range in maximum adult size from about 13 feet (4.0 m) (grampus) to about 33 feet (10.1 m) (the minke whale). This group includes such widely distributed and frequently encountered species as the pilot whales, false killer whales, and minke whales, and such rarely encountered and poorly known species as the various \"beaked whales\" (_Mesoplodon_ spp. and the goosebeaked whale).  Aside from their common inclusion within the stated size range and the presence of a dorsal fin in all species (which ranges from only a small nubbin in some of the beaked whales to a substantial 5- to 6-foot [1.5- to 1.8-m] sail on adult male killer whales), these species have no diagnostic field characteristics in common. Therefore, each is discussed in detail and is placed in the text in near proximity to those species with which it is likely to be confused in the field.  [Sidenote: MINKE WHALE  _Balaenoptera acutorostrata_  p. 63]    Body to 30 feet (9.1 m), or more, long.   Body black or dark gray; area of gray shading on each side just     in front of and below dorsal fin.   Flippers have transverse white band.   Head very sharply V-shaped viewed from above.   Dorsal fin falcate and distinct; usually appears simultaneous     with blow.   Blow often low and indistinct.   Distribution polar, temperate, and tropical; frequently coastal.   Often curious about boats.   Flukes not raised on dive.  [Sidenote: NORTHERN BOTTLENOSED WHALE  _Hyperoodon ampullatus_  p. 67]    Body to 32 feet (9.8 m) long.   Body of young uniformly chocolate brown; body of adults brown     with cream or yellow blotches.   Head bulbous in adults and white in larger animals; has distinct     beak.   Dorsal fin falcate and distinct, in last one-third of back.   Distribution north temperate and Arctic-offshore.   Often curious about boats.   Flukes large, rarely notched; occasionally raised on long dive.  [Sidenote: GOOSEBEAKED WHALE  _Ziphius cavirostris_  p. 70]    Body to at least 23 feet (7 m) long.
