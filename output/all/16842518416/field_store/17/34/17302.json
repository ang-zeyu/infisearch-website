Orizaba, Veracruz.      _Geographic distribution._--East side of the Sierra Madre     Oriental in Veracruz, from Jalancingo south to Xuchil.      _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; tail no shorter than     head and body (100-114.8%); dorsum dark (near Prout's Brown or     Mummy Brown middorsally, Clay Color on sides); supraorbital     border rounded; anterior palatine foramina long.      _Comparisons._--_P. b. beatae_ differs from other subspecies of     _P. boylii_ by the combination of large size, long tail, and     dark color.  _Remarks._--Thomas (1903:485) described _P. beatae_ on the basis of five specimens from Xometla Camp (lat. 18° 59' N, long. 97° 10' W) and one juvenile from Santa Barbara Camp, both on the Volcán de Orizaba, Veracruz. Thomas thought that _beatae_ was related to _aztecus_, but the differences relied on by him to distinguish the two are the same as those that distinguish _aztecus_ from _boylii_. Osgood (1909:153) placed _beatae_ in synonymy under _P. b. levipes_ because Mount Orizaba (type locality of _beatae_) is \"relatively very near\" Mount Malinche (type locality of _levipes_), and Thomas had not compared _beatae_ with _levipes_. Xometla, on the east side of the Volcán de Orizaba, is approximately 56 miles east of the Tlaxcalan part of Mount Malinche and is situated where the Tropical Life-zone begins, whereas Mount Malinche is in the Austral Life-zone on the Mexican Plateau; the difference in habitat between the two places is great. Topotypes of _levipes_ differ from two topotypes of _beatae_ in the same fashion as do other specimens of _levipes_ (from San Luis Potosí) from other specimens of _beatae_ (from Veracruz). Unfortunately, the topotypes of _beatae_ lack external measurements and are subadults, but their coloration agrees with that of other specimens that are here referred to _beatae_.  Hall and Kelson (1959:634, map 364) incorrectly mapped the distribution of _levipes_ in Veracruz. There are at least two places named Xuchil in the state of Veracruz and Hall and Kelson (_loc. cit._) unfortunately plotted the one at lat. 20° 42' N, long. 97° 42' W whereas the specimens actually were collected at the Xuchil on the pleateau south of the Volcán de Orizaba (18° 53' N, 97° 14' W) in the west-central part of Veracruz. The specimens from Xuchil are _P. b. beatae_.  Intergradation in color between the two subspecies _levipes_ and _beatae_ is seen in specimens from Jalapa and Zacualpan (3 km. N, also others from 3 km. W), Veracruz. Intergradation between these two subspecies possibly will be found elsewhere along the Sierra Madre Oriental.      _Specimens examined._--Total 60 as follows: VERACRUZ: 1 km. E     Jalancingo, 6500 ft., 2; _2 km. S Jalancingo_, 2; 6 km. SSE     Altotonga, 8000 ft., 8; _1 km. W Las Vigas, 8500 ft._, 2; Las     Vigas, 8500 ft., 13; _2 km. E Las Vigas, 8000 ft._, 5; _3 km. E     Las Vigas, 8000 ft._, 8; _5 km. E Las Vigas_, 7 (TAM); _5 km. N     Jalapa, 4500 ft._, 2; _Jalapa_, 1 (USNM); 10 km. SE Perote, N     slope Cofre de Perote, 10,500 ft., 1 (TAM); Xometla Camp, Mt.     Orizaba, 8500 ft., 2 (BM); _Sta. Barbara, Mt. Orizaba, 12,000     ft._, 1 (BM); Xuchil, 6 (CM).   #Peromyscus boylii ambiguus# new subspecies      _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull, No. 33092, United States     National Museum, from Monterrey, Nuevo León; obtained on     February 17, 1891, by Wm. Lloyd, original number 377.      _Geographic distribution._--Eastern Coahuila, central Nuevo     León, and the Sierra San Carlos, Tamaulipas.      _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; tail averaging longer     than head and body (90-114%); dorsal coloration ochraceous,     slightly darker middorsally; cheeks and lateral line Capucine     Orange; skull small; supraorbital border rounded; anterior     palatine foramina short.      _Comparisons._--_P. b. ambiguus_ differs from _P. b. levipes_ in     smaller size, longer tail relative to length of head and body,     smaller incisive foramina, brighter and paler color, and     relatively broader interorbital region. From _P. b. beatae_, _P.     b. ambiguus_ differs in being smaller in all parts measured and     paler.  _Remarks._--Osgood (1909:155) reported as _P. b. levipes_ 37 specimens from Monterrey and 18 from Cerro de la Silla, Nuevo León, but noted that they were \"aberrant.\" I have examined those same specimens and can hardly decide to which species, _P. boylii_ or _P. pectoralis_, they belong. Everything considered I, as did Osgood, opine that the specimens are _P. boylii_. However, I do not rule out the possibility that in this area there is an unnamed species, because I find an unusually wide range of variation in such cranial characters as size of the bullae, width and form of the pterygoid fossa, and shape of the braincase. Extremes of these characters are not constantly associated except in one specimen (33124 USNM), which is the smallest of all the adults examined. It has small bullae, a short rostrum, widely spreading zygomatic arches anteriorly, and a narrow pterygoid fossa, but does not differ externally from the other specimens. Additional material from this area is needed in order to make out the systematic position of these mice.  Because of the wide range of variation in some of its characters, _P. b. ambiguus_ is difficult to diagnose. Nevertheless, its small external and cranial size, short anterior palatine foramina, and bright color seem to separate it from other subspecies of _P. boylii_ in the eastern part of the range of the species. These differences are most conspicuous when specimens from the northernmost part of the range of _levipes_ are compared with specimens of _ambiguus_.  The specimens from the Sierra San Carlos, Tamaulipas, closely resemble _levipes_ in color, but are referred to _ambiguus_ on the basis of small size, as also are the two specimens from 12 km. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, Coahuila.  TABLE 1.
