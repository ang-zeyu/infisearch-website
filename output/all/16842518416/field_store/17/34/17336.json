His \"wife\" was walking down the main platform which ended against the wall of a signal-cabin, and there might be insuperable difficulties in that direction.  \"Isn't this the easiest way?\" she snapped.  \"Yes, if you want to get run over.\"  Without waiting for her, he turned, shouldered the ladder, and made for a platform on the inner side of the bay. A ten-foot wall indicated the station's boundary. Irene ran after him. Within a few yards they were hidden by the train from the sentry's sight.  \"That was clever of you!\" she whispered breathlessly.  \"Speak German, even when you think we are alone,\" he commanded.  The platform curved sharply, and the train was a long one. When they neared the engine they saw three men standing there. Dalroy at once wrapped the lamp in a fold of his blouse, and leaped into the black shadow cast by the wall, which lay athwart the flood of moonlight pouring into the open part of the station. Quick to take the cue, it being suicidal to think of bamboozling local railway officials, Irene followed. Kicking off the clumsy sabots, Dalroy bade his companion pick them up, ran back some thirty yards, and placed the ladder against the wall. Mounting swiftly, he found, to his great relief, that some sheds with low-pitched roofs were ranged beneath; otherwise, the height of the wall, if added to the elevation of the station generally above the external ground level, might well have proved disastrous.  \"Up you come,\" he said, seating himself astride the coping-stones, and holding the top of the ladder.  Irene was soon perched there too. He pulled up the ladder, and lowered it to a roof.  \"Now, you grab hard in case it slips,\" he said.  Disdaining the rungs, he slid down. He had hardly gathered his poise before the girl tumbled into his arms, one of the heavy wooden shoes she was carrying giving him a smart tap on the head.  \"These men!\" she gasped. \"They saw me, and shouted.\"  Dalroy imagined that the trio near the engine must have noted the swinging lantern and its sudden disappearance. With the instant decision born of polo and pig-sticking in India, he elected now not to essay the slanting roof just where they stood. Shouldering the ladder again, he made off toward a strip of shadow which seemed to indicate the end of a somewhat higher shed. He was right. Irene followed, and they crouched there in panting silence.  Nearly every German is a gymnast, and it was no surprise to Dalroy when one of their pursuers mounted on the shoulders of a friend and gained the top of the wall.  \"There's nothing to be seen here,\" he announced after a brief survey.  The pair beneath must have answered, because he went on, evidently in reply, \"Oh, I saw it myself. And I'm sure there was some one up here. There's a sentry on No. 5. Run, Fritz, and ask him if a man with a lantern has passed recently. I'll mount guard till you return.\"  Happily a train approached, and, in the resultant din Dalroy was enabled to scramble down the roof unheard.  The ladder just reached the ground; so, before Fritz and the sentry began to suspect that some trickery was afoot in that part of the station, the two fugitives were speeding through a dark lane hemmed in by warehouses. At the first opportunity, Dalroy extinguished the lantern. Then he bethought him of his companion's appearance. He halted suddenly ere they entered a lighted thoroughfare.  \"I had better put on these clogs again,\" he said. \"But what about you? It will never do for a lady in smart attire to be seen walking through the streets with a ruffian like me at one o'clock in the morning.\"  For answer, the girl took off her hat and tore away a cluster of roses and a coquettish bow of ribbon. Then she discarded her jacket, which she adjusted loosely across her shoulders.  \"Now I ought to look raffish enough for anything,\" she said cheerfully.  Singularly enough, her confidence raised again in Dalroy's mind a lurking doubt which the success thus far achieved had not wholly stilled.  \"My candid advice to you now, Miss Beresford, is that you leave me,\" he said. \"You will come to no harm in the main streets, and you speak German so well that you should have little difficulty in reaching the Dutch frontier. Once in Holland you can travel to Brussels by way of Antwerp. I believe England has declared war against Germany. The behaviour of Von Halwig and those other Prussians is most convincing on that point. If so----\"  \"Does my presence imperil you, Captain Dalroy?\" she broke in. She could have said nothing more unwise, nothing so subtly calculated to stir a man's pride.  \"No,\" he answered shortly.  \"Why, then, are you so anxious to get rid of me, after risking your life to save me a few minutes ago?\"  \"I am going straight into Belgium. I deem it my duty. I may pick up information of the utmost military value.\"  \"Then I go into Belgium too, unless you positively refuse to be bothered with my company. I simply must reach my sister without a moment of unnecessary delay. And is it really sensible to stand here arguing, so close to the station?\"  They went on without another word. Dalroy was ruffled by the suggestion that he might be seeking his own safety. Trust any woman to find the joint in any man's armour when it suits her purpose.  Aix-la-Chapelle was more awake on that Wednesday morning at one o'clock than on any ordinary day at the same hour in the afternoon. The streets were alive with excited people, the taverns and smaller shops open, the main avenues crammed with torrents of troops streaming westward. Regimental bands struck up martial airs as column after column debouched from the various stations. When the musicians paused for sheer lack of breath the soldiers bawled \"_Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles_\" or \"_Die Wacht am Rhine_\" at the top of their voices. The uproar was, as the Germans love to say, colossal. The enthusiasm was colossal too. Aix-la-Chapelle might have been celebrating a great national festival. It seemed ludicrous to regard the community as in the throes of war. The populace, the officers, even the heavy-jowled peasants who formed the majority of the regiments then hurrying to the front, seemed to be intoxicated with joy. Dalroy was surprised at first. He was not prepared for the savage exultation with which German militarism leaped to its long-dreamed-of task of conquering Europe.  Irene Beresford, momentarily more alive than he to the exigencies of their position, bought a common shawl at a shop in a side street, and threw away her tattered hat with a careless laugh. She was an excellent actress. The woman who served her had not the remotest notion that this bright-eyed girl belonged to the hated English race.  The incident brought back Dalroy's vagrom thoughts from German methods of making war to the serious business which was his own particular concern. The shop was only a couple of doors removed from the Franz Strasse; he waited for Irene at the corner, buying some cheap cigars and a box of matches at a tobacconist's kiosk. He still retained the lantern, which lent a touch of character. The carriage-cleaner's breeches were wide and loose at the ankles, and concealed his boots. Between the sabots and his own heels he had added some inches to his height, so he could look easily over the heads of the crowd; he was watching the passing of a battery of artillery when an open automobile was jerked to a standstill directly in front of him. In the car was seated Von Halwig.  That sprig of Prussian nobility was in a mighty hurry, but even he dared not interfere too actively with troops in motion, so, to pass the time as it were, he rolled his eyes in anger at the crowd on the pavement.  It was just possible that Irene might appear inopportunely, so Dalroy rejoined her, and led her to the opposite side of the cross street, where a wagon and horses hid her from the Guardsman's sharp eyes.  Thus it happened that Chance again took the wanderers under her wing.  A short, thick-set Walloon had emptied a glass of schnapps at the counter of a small drinking-bar which opened on to the street, and was bidding the landlady farewell.  \"I must be off,\" he said. \"I have to be in Visé by daybreak. This cursed war has kept me here a whole day. Who is fighting who, I'd like to know?\"  \"Visé!\" guffawed a man seated at the bar. \"You'll never get there. The army won't let you pass.\"  \"That's the army's affair, not mine,\" was the typically Flemish answer, and the other came out, mounted the wagon, chirped to his horses, and made away.  Dalroy was able to note the name on a small board affixed to the side of the vehicle: \"Henri Joos, miller, Visé.\"  \"That fellow lives in Belgium,\" he whispered to Irene, who had draped the shawl over her head and neck, and now carried the jacket rolled into a bundle. \"He is just the sort of dogged countryman who will tackle and overcome all obstacles. I fancy he is carrying oats to a mill, and will be known to the frontier officials. Shall we bargain with him for a lift?\"  \"It sounds the very thing,\" agreed the girl.  In their eagerness, neither took the precaution of buying something to eat. They overtook the wagon before it passed the market. The driver was not Joos, but Joos's man. He was quite ready to earn a few francs, or marks--he did not care which--by conveying a couple of passengers to the placid little town of whose mere existence the wide world outside Belgium was unaware until that awful first week in August 1914.  And so it came to pass that Dalroy and his protégé passed out of Aix-la-Chapelle without let or hindrance, because the driver, spurred to an effort of the imagination by promise of largesse, described Irene to the Customs men as Henri Joos's niece, and Dalroy as one deputed by the railway to see that a belated consignment of oats was duly delivered to the miller.  Neither rural Germany nor rural Belgium was yet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33622"],["title","The Day of Wrath: A Story of 1914 (#5)"],["body"," at war. The monstrous shadow had darkened the chancelleries, but it was hardly perceptible to the common people. Moreover, how could red-fanged war affect a remote place like Visé? The notion was nonsensical. Even Dalroy allowed himself to assure his companion that there was now a reasonable prospect of reaching Belgian soil without incurring real danger. Yet, in truth, he was taking her to an inferno of which the like is scarce known to history. The gate which opened at the Customs barrier gave access apparently to a good road leading through an undulating country. In sober truth, it led to an earthly hell.     CHAPTER III  FIRST BLOOD   Though none of the three in the wagon might even hazard a guess at the tremendous facts, the German wolf had already made his spring and been foiled. Not only had he missed his real quarry, France, he had also broken his fangs on the tough armour of Liège. These things Dalroy and Irene Beresford were to learn soon. The first intimation that the Belgian army had met and actually fought some portion of the invading host came before dawn.  The road to Visé ran nearly parallel with, but some miles north of, the main artery between Aix-la-Chapelle and Liège. During the small hours of the night it held a locust flight of German cavalry. Squadron after squadron, mostly Uhlans, trotted past the slow-moving cart; but Joos's man, Maertz, if stolid and heavy-witted, had the sense to pull well out of the way of these hurrying troopers; beyond evoking an occasional curse, he was not molested. The brilliant moon, though waning, helped the riders to avoid him.  Dalroy and the girl were comfortably seated, and almost hidden, among the sacks of oats; they were free to talk as they listed.  Naturally, a soldier's eyes took in details at once which would escape a woman; but Irene Beresford soon noted signs of the erratic fighting which had taken place along that very road.  \"Surely we are in Belgium now?\" she whispered, after an awed glance at the lights and bustling activity of a field hospital established near the hamlet of Aubel.  \"Yes,\" said Dalroy quietly, \"we have been in Belgium fully an hour.\"  \"And have the Germans actually attacked this dear little country?\"  \"So it would seem.\"  \"But why? I have always understood that Belgium was absolutely safe. All the great nations of the world have guaranteed her integrity.\"  \"That has been the main argument of every spouter at International Peace Congresses for many a year,\" said Dalroy bitterly. \"If Belgium and Holland can be preserved by agreement, they contended, why should not all other vexed questions be settled by arbitration? Yet one of our chaps in the Berlin Embassy, the man whose ticket you travelled with, told me that the Kaiser could be bluntly outspoken when that very question was raised during the autumn manoeuvres last year. 'I shall sweep through Belgium thus,' he said, swinging his arm as though brushing aside a feeble old crone who barred his way. And he was talking to a British officer too.\"  \"What a crime! These poor, inoffensive people! Have they resisted, do you think?\"  \"That field hospital looked pretty busy,\" was the grim answer.  A little farther on, at a cross-road, there could no longer be any doubt as to what had happened. The remains of a barricade littered the ditches. Broken carts, ploughs, harrows, and hurdles lay in heaps. The carcasses of scores of dead horses had been hastily thrust aside so as to clear a passage. In a meadow, working by the light of lanterns, gangs of soldiers and peasants were digging long pits, while row after row of prone figures could be glimpsed when the light carried by those directing the operations chanced to fall on them.  Dalroy knew, of course, that all the indications pointed to a successful, if costly, German advance, which was the last thing he had counted on in this remote countryside. If the tide of war was rolling into Belgium it should, by his reckoning, have passed to the south-west, engulfing the upper valley of the Meuse and the two Luxembourgs perhaps, but leaving untouched the placid land on the frontier of Holland. For a time he feared that Holland, too, was being attacked. Understanding something of German pride, though far as yet from plumbing the depths of German infamy, he imagined that the Teutonic host had burst all barriers, and was bent on making the Rhine a German river from source to sea.  Naturally he did not fail to realise that the lumbering wagon was taking him into a country already securely held by the assailants. There were no guards at the cross-roads, no indications of military precautions. The hospital, the grave-diggers, the successive troops of cavalry, felt themselves safe even in the semi-darkness, and this was the prerogative of a conquering army. In the conditions, he did not regard his life as worth much more than an hour's purchase, and he tortured his wits in vain for some means of freeing the girl, who reposed such implicit confidence in him, from the meshes of a net which he felt to be tightening every minute. He simply dreaded the coming of daylight, heralded already by tints of heliotrope and pink in the eastern sky. Certain undulating contours were becoming suspiciously clear in that part of the horizon. It might be only what Hafiz describes as the false dawn; but, false or true, the new day was at hand. He was on the verge of advising Irene to seek shelter in some remote hovel which their guide could surely recommend when Fate took control of affairs.  Maertz had now pulled up in obedience to an unusually threatening order from a Uhlan officer whose horse had been incommoded in passing. Above the clatter of hoofs and accoutrements Dalroy's trained ear had detected the sounds of a heavy and continuous cannonade toward the south-west.  \"How far are we from Visé?\" he asked the driver.  The man pointed with his whip. \"You see that black knob over there?\" he said.  \"Yes.\"  \"That's a clump of trees just above the Meuse. Visé lies below it.\"  \"But how far?\"  \"Not more than two kilomètres.\"  Two kilomètres! About a mile and a half! Dalroy was tortured by indecision. \"Shall we be there by daybreak?\"  \"With luck. I don't know what's been happening here. These damned Germans are swarming all over the place. They must be making for the bridge.\"  \"What bridge?\"  \"The bridge across the Meuse, of course. Don't you know these parts?\"  \"Not very well.\"  \"I wish I were safe at home; I'd get indoors and stop there,\" growled the driver, chirping his team into motion again.  Dalroy's doubts were stilled. Better leave this rustic philosopher to work out their common salvation.  A few hundred yards ahead the road bifurcated. One branch led to Visé, the other to Argenteau. Here was stationed a picket, evidently intended as a guide for the cavalry.  Most fortunately Dalroy read aright the intention of an officer who came forward with an electric torch. \"Lie as flat as you can!\" he whispered to Irene. \"If they find us, pretend to be asleep.\"  \"Hi, you!\" cried the officer to Maertz, \"where the devil do you think you're going?\"  \"To Joos's mill at Visé,\" said the gruff Walloon.  \"What's in the cart?\"  \"Oats.\"  \"_Almächtig!_ Where from?\"  \"Aachen.\"  \"You just pull ahead into that road there. I'll attend to you and your oats in a minute or two.\"  \"But can't I push on?\"  The officer called to a soldier. \"See that this fellow halts twenty yards up the road,\" he said. \"If he stirs then, put your bayonet through him. These Belgian swine don't seem to understand that they are Germans now, and must obey orders.\"  The officer, of course, spoke in German, the Walloon in the mixture of Flemish and Low Dutch which forms the _patois_ of the district. But each could follow the other's meaning, and the quaking listeners in the middle of the wagon had no difficulty at all in comprehending the gravity of this new peril.  Maertz was swearing softly to himself; they heard him address a question to the sentry when the wagon stopped again. \"Why won't your officer let us go to Visé?\" he growled.  \"Sheep's-head! do as you're told, or it will be bad for you,\" was the reply.  The words were hardly out of the soldier's mouth before a string of motor lorries, heavy vehicles with very powerful engines, thundered up from the rear. The leaders passed without difficulty, as there was plenty of room. But their broad flat tires sucked up clouds of dust, and the moon had sunk behind a wooded height. One of the hindermost transports, taking too wide a bend, crashed into the wagon. The startled horses plunged, pulled Maertz off his perch, and dragged the wagon into a deep ditch. It fell on its side, and Dalroy and his companion were thrown into a field amid a swirl of laden sacks, some of which burst.  Dalroy was unhurt, and he could only hope that the girl also had escaped injury. Ere he rose he clasped her around the neck and clapped a hand over her mouth lest she should scream. \"Not a word!\" he breathed into her ear. \"Can you manage to crawl on all-fours straight on by the side of the hedge? Never mind thorns or nettles. It's our only chance.\"  In a few seconds they were free of the hubbub which sprang up around the overturned wagon and the transport, the latter having shattered a wheel. Soon they were able to rise, crouching behind the hedge as they ran. They turned at an angle, and struck off into the country, following the line of another hedge which trended slightly uphill. At a gateway they turned again, moving, as Dalroy calculated, on the general line of the Visé road. A low-roofed shanty loomed up suddenly against the sky. It was just the place to house an outpost, and Dalroy was minded to avoid it when the lowing of a cow in pain revealed to his trained intelligence the practical certainty that the animal had been left there unattended, and needed milking. Still, he took no unnecessary risks.  \"Remain here,\" he murmured. \"I'll go ahead and investigate, and return in a minute or so.\" "]]]
