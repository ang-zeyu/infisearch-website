Her host shook his head gravely.  \"You are very kind, Madame, and yet I am afraid I cannot accept your defense of my son. His ancestors were Spanish adventurers and soldiers and my own fought with Washington. However, I shall be delighted to visit your camp. One of the many reasons I wished to persuade you to remain over night with us was in order that Felipe might learn to know the girls who are with you. I fancied that he was immediately interested in one of them. Perhaps later she may prove an inspiration, a spur to him. American girls must have no patience with slackers these days. But suppose we cease talking about the war which haunts us all so everlastingly. Won't you walk with me and look at some of the other views about the old place by moonlight?\"  Mrs. Burton and her host entered the front door of the house, crossed the large sitting room and came out upon one of the paths of the enclosed garden.  Now the air was almost suffocatingly sweet with the night fragrances of the semi-tropical flowers.  Under the deep magenta canopy of the bougainvillea vine the older woman discovered Gerry and her younger host.  Felipe Morris was holding a guitar, but for the moment he and Gerry were quietly talking. Feeling too shaken and uncomfortable to remain out of bed, and realizing by feminine intuition that Felipe would prefer to be alone with Gerry, Sally Ashton had retired some time before.  Now, although Mrs. Burton made no effort to interrupt Gerry's whispered conversation with Felipe Morris, she did wonder a little curiously what her influence upon the young man would be, if by chance he had been attracted by her.  There was no denying Gerry's exquisite prettiness; tonight with her pale gold hair, her fairness and grace she seemed in tune with the beauty of this old-world garden. Yet Mrs. Burton believed that Gerry was shallow and vain and that her ideas of life included less of devotion to duty and self-sacrifice than Felipe's. It was difficult to conceive of her acting as a motive force to high endeavor, Gerry, who dreamed only of money and pretty clothes and what she was pleased to consider \"society.\"  Then Mrs. Burton sighed as she followed her host into the land which lay on the other side of the hedge. Had one the right to demand that Gerry and Felipe think of war tonight in a shrine, dedicated like this enclosed garden, to the service of youth and romance?     CHAPTER VIII  Felipe   As soon as Mrs. Burton and his father were out of sight Felipe began singing:      \"I will make you brooches and toys for your delight     Of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night.     I will make a palace fit for you and me,     Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.      \"I will make my kitchen and you shall keep your room     Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom     And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white     In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night.      \"And this shall be for music when no one else is near,     The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!     That only I remember, that only you admire,     On the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire.\"  Then Felipe's song ended, and yet it seemed to Gerry that she could still hear the inflections of his voice.  \"Thank you; that was lovely. I did not know I cared so much for music before,\" the girl answered simply and without the least touch of coquetry which one might have expected of a girl like Gerry in such surroundings. \"But what an exquisite voice you have and what a beautiful night it is! I am sure I do not remember another half so lovely.\"  Then Gerry leaned forward a little so that she could see more clearly out into the garden.  \"I don't wonder you feel that you cannot give all this up,\" she continued, with a graceful movement of her hand. \"It seems to me wicked that you should be forced into the war, hating it as you do and perhaps spoiling your future as a singer. I agree with you, one ought to live his own life. All men are not equally fitted to be soldiers.\"  Gerry spoke with an unexpected vehemence which rather surprised her. For the past hour Felipe Morris had been pouring forth his side of the war problem to her, but as he was an entire stranger there was no especial reason why she should be so disturbed over the thought of his being forced to enter the army.  \"I suppose I understand why you so hate giving up your home and your life here on the ranch and your music and all the rest, because I have never had a home of my own, or any possessions of much value,\" Gerry ended in a quieter voice and manner.  \"You possess nothing of value!\" Felipe Morris repeated, and although he said nothing more Gerry felt oddly flattered and happy.  Then Felipe laughed unexpectedly.  \"I wonder if you realize, Miss Williams, that we have seen each other before tonight, probably about ten days or more ago? My friend Merton Anderson and I chanced to be spending the night at San Juan Capistrano when you and your friends rode into the old mission town. You don't know how much curiosity your appearance excited. You gave the old town the greatest thrill it has had in a long time. You see the little town is more than half foreign; there are Spaniards and Mexicans and half-breed Indians. You were dressed in a kind of compromise Indian costume, and down there we had never seen or heard of the Camp Fire. Merton and I hid ourselves on one of the verandas and sang a duet for your benefit. Then later, when it was too dark for us to see one another distinctly, we followed your party about the mission grounds.\"  Gerry frowned and then blushed a little from embarrassment.  \"Were you wearing Mexican costumes? I confess Sally and I did become interested in you, but we supposed of course that you were either Mexicans or Spaniards. Your song was in Spanish so that we could not understand it.\"  \"Shall I sing to you in Spanish now?\" Felipe returned. \"I speak the language as readily as I do English. You see my mother was of Spanish origin and she and an old nurse who lives near here always spoke in Spanish to me when I was a kid. You were right about the Mexican costumes. Anderson and I had been over into Mexico for a few days and were on our way home. I like to escape over there now and then when life at the ranch becomes too slow. I can be mistaken for a Mexican when I wish and it is sometimes amusing.\"  Gerry nodded, preferring to have Felipe talk to her rather than to offer him confidences. Oddly she was wishing tonight that she had read as many books as the other Camp Fire girls and had enjoyed the same advantages.  \"Then you saw all seven of us at Capistrano?\" she asked at length; adding, \"There are five other girls in our Camp Fire group.\"  Felipe laughed. \"Yes, I saw all of you, yet it was you alone I remembered,\" he murmured with true Spanish gallantry.  \"Thank you for that compliment, although obviously I fished for it,\" Gerry returned, smiling. \"But won't you tell me, now that the draft has been ordered and your number called, how are you going to manage to escape? Of course I shall not speak to any one else of what you tell me.\"  \"I am glad enough to tell you,\" Felipe Morris continued boyishly. \"You can't imagine how hard it has been to have no one to sympathize with me. I have wished many times since war was declared that my mother was alive and I could have talked the situation over with her. My father, as I told you, is dead against me. He thinks I am a renegade and a disgrace to him and to his name, and a lot of stuff like that. It seems his brothers all fought in the Civil War and were officers and it has been the regret of his life he was too young. I wish he had the chance offered him now instead of me,\" he concluded like a surly boy, with all his gallantry departed.  \"But what are you going to do?\" Gerry insisted, her interest in him remaining so far unaffected by his attitude.  \"Oh, I am too plagued healthy, so the doctor won't help me out. I hoped to be released on the score of ill health at first. But later I sent in a claim saying I could not be released for war service because I was the sole support of my parent and had to be left here to look after the ranch. I don't see why raising beans cannot be considered war work? Father insists he can run the place himself and I am afraid he won't stand by me when the exemption board asks him concerning the truth of my claim. Pretty tough when a fellow's own father is anxious to get him off his hands to the extent of possibly being killed.\"  Felipe laid his guitar down on the piazza and in spite of the fact that he must have been at least twenty-two or twenty-three years old, Gerry found herself with a ridiculous desire to comfort him.  \"It is just a difference of opinion,\" she said softly. \"I don't believe if I were you I would blame my father, and he should have the same respect for you. I never thought of the question before, but I have decided tonight I do not believe in the draft. Isn't there anything else you can do, if this one exemption claim fails?\"  Felipe Morris rose up, shrugging his shoulders impatiently. He was so foreign in his appearance that the movement seemed natural.  \"Oh, yes, I can slip away into Mexico and remain until the war is over. I have been thinking of it as a possibility. But of course if I am caught I shall be put into prison as a deserter.\"  Then he stood gazing down upon Gerry with a bewildered expression.  \"I wonder why I have entrusted my fate to you in this fashion? You understand that if you should ever tell what I have confided to you, things would be all over with me.\"  Gerry also rose. \"Shall we walk about your garden for a little?\" she said. \"I am tired of sitting still so long. I expect Mrs. Burton will be here in a little time and think we should go to bed. But you need not worry with regard to my ever mentioning a word of what you have said to me--not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],["title","The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net.

Some parts of the country, because of their accessibility, soon became relatively well known; other regions lying off the beaten path were bypassed or inadequately sampled. Principally in the last decade herpetologists have been entering regions from which no collections previously were available in an attempt to fill gaps in known distributions and to discover unknown species of animals. In 1950 Dr. Donald D. Brand led an exploration party from the University of Texas to the poorly explored and faunistically unknown region of southwestern Michoacán. James A. Peters accompanied Brand and collected amphibians and reptiles. In 1951 I welcomed the opportunity to accompany Brand on a second expedition to southwestern Michoacán. Such was the beginning of my interest in the herpetofauna of the region. I have been fortunate to return to Michoacán on four successive trips, all of which had as their purpose the accumulation of data on the herpetofauna that would result in a survey of the component species and an analysis of their distribution.  My original intention was to amplify Peters' (1954) study based on the collections made by him in 1950 and by me in 1951 in the Sierra de Coalcomán. But it soon became evident that in order to understand the relationships of the herpetofauna of the Sierra de Coalcomán, the species inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley and adjacent mountain ranges would have to be studied. In the course of making that study I examined all specimens from Michoacán already in museums.  There have been few detailed herpetofaunal studies in México. The first such study of any consequence was that by Bogert and Oliver (1945) on the herpetofauna of Sonora. In that paper the authors analyzed the fauna from a geographic view and showed the transition from tropical species in the southern part of the state to members of the Sonoran Desert assemblage to the north. Martin (1958) made a detailed study of the herpetofauna of the Gómez Farías region in southern Tamaulipas; he emphasized the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in that region with special reference to cloud forests. Duellman (1958c) presented a preliminary geographic analysis of the herpetofauna of Colima with special reference to the continuity of the species inhabiting the lowlands. Zweifel (1960) discussed in detail the herpetofauna of the Tres Marías Islands and commented on the derivation of the fauna. Duellman (1960d) provided a detailed account of the geographic distribution of the amphibians known to occur in the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and attempted to account for the present patterns of distribution.  The present report is the first of two parts dealing with the herpetofauna of Michoacán. The purpose of this part is to present a full account of the species of amphibians and reptiles known to inhabit the state of Michoacán; the accounts of the species are accompanied by a brief description of the natural landscape and of the various assemblages of species comprising the major faunistic groups within the region. A gazetteer of collecting localities is appended. The second part of the study, now in preparation, deals with the ecological and historical geography of the herpetofauna. Since the present part will be of interest primarily to systematic herpetologists, I have decided to separate it from the more general material of interest to biogeographers.  One of the major problems that faces the worker undertaking a faunal study is the presence of species or genera of unsettled systematic status. My work in Michoacán has been no exception; fifteen separate studies were undertaken in an attempt to solve systematic problems in certain groups. Some systematic problems still remain but are of little consequence insofar as the entire faunal picture is concerned, or are so involved as to be impractical to undertake at this time. In accounts of species, such problems are mentioned in the hope that they will interest some worker who will be inclined to investigate them.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  While engaged in the study of the herpetofauna of Michoacán I have built up a debt of gratitude to many individuals, without whose aid my ambition to complete my study never would have been realized. I am especially grateful to those individuals who accompanied me in the field; Lee D. Beatty, Richard E. Etheridge, Carter R. Gilbert, Fred G. Thompson, Jerome Tulecke, and John Wellman offered stimulating companionship and valuable assistance. On many occasions they suffered hardships on behalf of my interests.  Studies of my own specimens have been augmented by material from other institutions. For permitting me to examine specimens in their care I am indebted to W. Frank Blair, Charles M. Bogert, Doris M. Cochran, William B. Davis, James R. Dixon, the late Emmett R. Dunn, Josef Eiselt, Alice G. C. Grandison, Norman Hartweg, Robert F. Inger, Arthur Loveridge, the late Karl P. Schmidt, Hobart M. Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Margaret Storey, Edward H. Taylor, and Richard G. Zweifel.  Several people have aided me in the study of specimens and in the analysis of data; I am grateful to Donald D. Brand, who first introduced me to Michoacán; since that time I have benefited much from his knowledge of the area. James A. Peters provided me with essential information concerning his field work in southern Michoacán in 1950. James R. Dixon and Floyd L. Downs have permitted me to use freely the material and data that they accumulated in their recent field work in Michoacán. Norman E. Hartweg allowed me to use the specimens and data that he gathered in his survey of the herpetofauna in the region of Volcán Parícutin. L. C. Stuart, Charles F. Walker, and Richard G. Zweifel have helped in unraveling some of the systematic and distributional problems.  I am especially grateful to my wife, Ann, who for six months helped me track down elusive species and explore new areas. Furthermore, she has stimulated me to carry this study to completion.  Many people in Michoacán favored the field parties with quarters, transportation, and valuable information, which greatly facilitated the field work. In this respect I am especially indebted to Ingeniero Ruben Erbina of Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, who not only let us use his home as our headquarters, but through a letter of introduction gave us the \"key\" to southern Michoacán. Ingeniero Pedro Tonda aided us in Arteaga and San Salvador. Ingeniero Anastacio Peréz Alfaro of the Comisión Tepalcatepec in Uruapan provided the latest maps of southern Michoacán and much essential information pertaining to travel conditions in the area. Señor Nefty Mendoza gave us a home in Dos Aguas; this kindness allowed us to work in this interesting region during the height of the rainy season. Mr. and Mrs. Bob Thomas let us make use of their facilities at Hacienda Zirimícuaro. The naval officers at the Estación Marina at Playa Azul made pleasant what might have been a dreadful stay in that small coastal village. To the managers and pilots of Lineas Aereas Picho in Uruapan I owe special thanks for going out of their way on more than one occasion to transport a stranded snake-hunter. Throughout the months of field work beginning in 1955 I constantly have been aided by the authorities and workers of the Comisión Tepalcatepec, a subdivision of the Secretaria de Caminos y Obras Publicas, and of the private corporation, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados. Much of the field work in Michoacán was made possible only through the co-operation of the natives who supplied mules, acted as guides, and aided in the collection of specimens. I have learned a great deal from these people. They will never see this report. Their work as guides, muleteers, and collectors greatly assisted me with the mountains of equipment that had to be piled on the backs of scrawny mules for transportation to places where the natives seldom trod. Their efforts in behalf of Don Guillermo never will be forgotten; I extend an especially hearty _muchas gracias_ to Benjamin, Ignacio, Jesús, Lorenzo, Mariano, and Remigio.  Much of the work on"]]]
