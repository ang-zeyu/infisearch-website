For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.  \"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\"  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\"     X--ALICE'S EVIDENCE   \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below.  \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay.  \"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice.  \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.  \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.  The King then read from his book: \"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\"  \"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.  \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the Queen.  [Illustration]  \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice.  The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.  \"There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\"  \"Please, Your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's no name signed at the end.\"  \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a general clapping of hands at this.  \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the White Rabbit.  There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the verses.  \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\" said the King.  \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,\" ventured Alice.  \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the jury consider their verdict.\"  \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the sentence first!\"  \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.  \"I won't!\" said Alice.  \"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.  \"Who cares for _you_?\" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a pack of cards!\"  [Illustration]  At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.  \"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\"  \"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

CONCLUSION    INTRODUCTION   The first printed suggestion that America should be called America came from a German. Martin Waldseemüller, of Freiburg, in his Cosmographiae Introductio, published in 1507, wrote: \"I do not see why any one may justly forbid it to be named after Americus, its discoverer, a man of sagacious mind, Amerige, that is the land of Americus or America, since both Europe and Asia derived their names from women.\"  The first complete ship-load of Germans left Gravesend July the 24th, 1683, and arrived in Philadelphia October the 6th, 1683. They settled in Germantown, or, as it was then called, on account of the poverty of the settlers, Armentown.  Up to within the last few years the majority of our settlers have been Teutonic in blood and Protestant in religion. The English, Dutch, Swedes, Germans, Scotch-Irish, who settled in America, were all, less than two thousand years ago, one Germanic race from the country surrounding the North Sea.  Since 1820 more than 5,200,000 Germans have settled in America. This immigration of Germans has practically ceased, and it is a serious loss to America, for it has been replaced by a much less desirable type of settler. In 1882 western Europe sent us 563,174 settlers, or 87 per cent., while southern and eastern Europe and Asiatic Turkey sent 83,637, or 13 per cent. In 1905 western Europe sent 215,863, or 21.7 per cent., and southern and eastern Europe and Asiatic Turkey, 808,856, or 78.9 per cent. of our new population. In 1910 there were 8,282,618 white persons of German origin in the United States; 2,501,181 were born in Germany; 3,911,847 were born in the United States, both of whose parents were born in Germany; 1,869,590 were born in the United States, one parent born in the United States and one in Germany.  Not only have we been enriched by this mass of sober and industrious people in the past, but Peter Mühlenberg, Christopher Ludwig, Steuben, John Kalb, George Herkimer, and later Francis Lieber, Carl Schurz, Sigel, Osterhaus, Abraham Jacobi, Herman Ridder, Oswald Ottendorfer, Adolphus Busch, Isidor, Nathan, and Oscar Straus, Jacob Schiff, Otto Kahn, Frederick Weyerheuser, Charles P. Steinmetz, Claus Spreckels, Hugo Münsterberg, and a catalogue of others, have been leaders in finance, in industry, in war, in politics, in educational and philanthropic enterprises, and in patriotism.  The framework of our republican institutions, as I have tried to outline in this volume, came from the \"Woods of Germany.\" Professor H. A. L. Fisher, of Oxford, writes: \"European republicanism, which ever since the French Revolution has been in the main a phenomenon of the Latin races, was a creature of Teutonic civilization in the age of the sea-beggars and the Roundheads. The half-Latin city of Geneva was the source of that stream of democratic opinion in church and state, which, flowing to England under Queen Elizabeth, was repelled by persecution to Holland, and thence directed to the continent of North America.\"  In these later days Goethe, in a letter to Eckermann, prophesied the building of the Panama Canal by the Americans, and also the prodigious growth of the United States toward the West.  In a private collection in New York, is an autograph letter of George Washington to Frederick the Great, asking that Frederick should use his influence to protect that French friend of America, Lafayette.  In Schiller's house in Weimar there still hangs an engraving of the battle of Bunker Hill, by Müller, a German, and a friend of the poet.  Bismarck's intimate friend as a student at Göttingen, and the man of whom he spoke with warm affection all his life, was the American historian Motley.  The German soldiers in our Civil War were numbered by the thousands. We have many ties with Germany, quite enough, indeed, to make a bare enumeration of them a sufficient introduction to this volume.  On more than one occasion of late I have been introduced in places, and to persons where a slight picture of what I was to meet when the doors were thrown open was of great help to me. I was told beforehand something of the history, traditions, the forms and ceremonies, and even something of the weaknesses and peculiarities of the society, the persons, and the personages. I am not so wise a guide as some of my sponsors have been, but it is something of the kind that I have wished and planned to do for my countrymen. I have tried to make this book, not a guidebook, certainly not a history; rather, in the words of Bacon, \"grains of salt, which will rather give an appetite than offend with satiety,\" a sketch, in short, of what is on the other side of the great doors when the announcer speaks your name and you enter Germany.    GERMANY AND THE GERMANS  FROM AN AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW    GERMANY AND THE GERMANS FROM AN AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW  I THE CRADLE OF MODERN GERMANY   Eighty-one years before the discovery of America, seventy-two years before Luther was born, and forty-one years before the discovery of printing, in the year 1411, the Emperor Sigismund, the betrayer of Huss, transferred the Mark of Brandenburg to his faithful vassal and cousin, Frederick, sixth Burgrave of Nuremberg. Nuremberg was at one time one of the great trading towns between Germany, Venice, and the East, and the home later of Hans Sachs. Frederick was the lineal descendant of Conrad of Hohenzollern, the first Burgrave of Nuremberg, who lived in the days of Frederick Barbarossa (1152-1189); and this Conrad is the twenty-fifth lineal ancestor of Emperor William II of Germany. It is interesting to remember in this connection that when we count back our progenitors to the twenty-first generation they number something over two millions. When we trace an ancestry so far, therefore, we must know something of the multitude from which the individual is descended, if we are to gather anything of value concerning his racial characteristics. The solace of all genealogical investigation is the infallible discovery, that the greatest among us began in a small way.  If you paddle up the Elbe and the Havel from Hamburg to Potsdam, you will find yourself in the territory conquered from the heathen Wends in the days of Henry I, the Fowler (918-935), which was the cradle of what is now the German Empire.  The Emperor Sigismund, who was often embarrassed financially by reason of his wars and journeyings had borrowed some four hundred thousand gold florins from Frederick, and it was in settlement of this debt that he mortgaged the territory of Brandenburg, and on the 8th of April, 1417, the ceremony of enfeoffment was performed at Constance, by which the House of Hohenzollern became possessed of this territory, and was thereafter included among the great electorates having a vote in the election of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.  It was Henricus Auceps, or Henry the Fowler, (so called because the envoys sent to offer him the crown, found him on his estates in the Hartz Mountains among his falcons), who fought off the Danes in the northwest, and the Slavonians, or Wends, in the northeast, and the Hungarians in the southeast, and established frontier posts or marks for permanent protection against their ravages. These marks, or marches, which were boundary lines, were governed by markgrafs or marquises, and finally gave the name of marks to the territory itself. The word is historically familiar from its still later use in noting the old boundaries between England and Scotland, and England and Wales, which are still called marks.  Henry the Fowler was also called Henry \"the City Builder.\" After the death of the last of the Charlemagne line of rulers, the Franks elected Conrad, Duke of Franconia, to succeed to the throne, and he on his death-bed advised his people to choose Henry of Saxony to succeed, for the times were stormy and the country needed a strong ruler. The Hungarians in the southeast, and the Wends, the old Slavonic population of Poland, were pillaging and harrying more and more successfully, and the more successfully the more impudently. Henry began the building of strong-walled, deep-moated cities along his frontier, and made one, drawn by lot, out of every ten families of the countryside, go to live in these fortified towns. Their rulers were burgraves, or city counts. Titles now so largely ornamental were then descriptive of duties and responsibilities.  In the light of their future greatness, it is well to take note of these two frontier counties, or marches. The first, called the Northern March, or March of Brandenburg, was the religious centre of the Slays, and was situated in the midst of forests and marshes just beyond the Elbe. This March of Brandenburg was won from the Slays in the first instance by the Saxons and Franks of the Saxon plain. When the burgrave, Frederick of Hohenzollern, came to take possession of his new territory he was received with the jesting remark: \"Were it to rain burgraves for a whole year, we should not allow them to grow in the march.\" But Frederick's soldiers and money, and his Nuremberg jewels, as his cannon were called, ended by gaining complete control, a control in more powerful hands to-day than ever before.  The second, called the Eastern or Austrian March, was situated in the basin of the Danube. These two great states were formed in lands that "]]]
