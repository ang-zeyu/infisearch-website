Now I warn you that, if you accomplish anything in this mission, you will do it at night and not in the daytime. That is all that need be said at the present time, Dave, and you will attend to your duty as usual. If you lose much sleep, you may make it up in the forenoon watch.\"  \"I don't care for the sleep, Captain Passford, and I can keep awake all night.\"  \"One thing more, Dave; between eight bells and eight bells to-night, during the first watch, you may get at something, but you must keep out of sight as much as you can,\" added Christy, as he rose from his armchair, and went into his state room.  Dave busied himself in clearing the table, but he was in a very thoughtful mood all the time. Loading up his tray with dishes, he carried them through the steerage to the galley, where he found Mulgrum engaged in washing those from the ward room, which he had brought out some time before. The steward looked at the deaf mute with more interest than he had regarded him before. He was a supernumerary on board, and any one who had anything to do called Pink to do it. Another waiter was greatly needed, and Mr. Nawood, the chief steward, had engaged one, but he had failed to come on board before the steamer sailed. Pink had been pressed into service for the steerage; but he was of little use, and the work seemed very distasteful, if not disgusting, to him. He carried in the food, but that was about all he was good for.  Dave watched him for a few minutes as he washed and wiped the dishes, and saw that he was very awkward at it; it was plain to him that he was not an experienced hand at the business. But he was doing the steward's work, and Dave took hold and helped him. Pink was as solemn as an owl, and did his work in a very mechanical manner, and without the slightest interest in it. The cabin steward had a mission, and he was profoundly interested in its execution.  By the side of the galley, or range, was a sink at which they were at work. Dave thought he might as well begin then and there to test the hearing powers of his companion. Picking up one of the large blowers of the range, he placed himself so that Pink could not see what he was about, and then banged the sheet iron against the cast iron of the great stove. He kept his eye fixed all the time on the scullion. The noise was enough for the big midship gun on deck, or even for a small earthquake. Pink was evidently startled by the prodigious sound, and turned towards the steward, who was satisfied that he had heard it; but the fellow was cunning, and realizing that he had committed himself, he picked up one of his feet, and began to rub it as though he had been hit by the falling blower. At the same time, he pretended to be very angry, and demonstrated very earnestly against his companion.  Dave felt that he had made a point, and he did not carry his investigation of the auditory capacity of the scullion any farther that night. He finished his work below, and then went on deck. He lounged about in a very careless manner till eight bells were struck. Mr. Flint on the bridge was relieved by Mr. Lillyworth, and the port watch came on duty for the next four hours, or until midnight. This was the time the captain had indicated to Dave as a favorable one for the discharge of his special duty. Taking advantage of the absence of any person from the vicinity of the foremast, he adroitly curled himself up in the folds of the foresail, which was brailed up to the mast. He had his head in such a position that he could see without being seen by any casual passer-by.  He waited in this position over an hour, and during that time Pink went back and forth several times, and seemed to be looking up at the bridge, which was just forward of the foremast. On the top-gallant forecastle were two men on the lookout; in the waist was a quartermaster, who was doing the duty that belonged to the third lieutenant, if the scarcity of officers had permitted the Bronx to have one. The body of the port watch were spinning yarns on the forecastle, and none of them were very near the foremast. After a while, as Pink was approaching the forecastle, Dave saw the second lieutenant gesticulating to him very earnestly to come on the bridge. The supernumerary ascended the ladder, and the officer set him at work to lace on the sailcloth to the railing of the bridge, to shelter those on duty there from the force of the sea blast.  Dave listened with all his ears for any sound from the bridge; but he soon realized that if there was any, he was too far off to hear it. With the aid of the lashings of the foresail, he succeeded in climbing up on the mast to a point on a level with the bridge, and at the same time to make the mast conceal him from the eyes of Mr. Lillyworth and the scullion. The latter pretended to be at work, and occasionally the second lieutenant \"jawed\" at him for his clumsiness in lacing the sailcloth. Between these growls, they spoke together in a low tone, but Dave was near enough to hear what they said. Though he had never heard the voice of Pink Mulgrum before, he knew that of the second lieutenant, and he was in no danger of confounding the two. Pink used excellent language, as the steward was capable of judging, and it was plain enough that he was not what he had appeared to be.    [Illustration: Lillyworth and Mulgrum on the bridge.]     CHAPTER VII  AN INTERVIEW ON THE BRIDGE   Although Mr. Lillyworth knew very well that Pink Mulgrum was deaf and dumb, he \"jawed\" at him as though his hearing was as perfect as his own, doubtless forgetting for the moment his infirmity.  \"Draw up the bight, and lace it tighter,\" exclaimed the second lieutenant, intermixing an expletive at each end of the sentence. \"Oh, you can't hear me!\" he shouted, as though the fact that the scullion could not hear him had suddenly come to his mind. \"Well, it is a nice thing to talk to a deaf man!\"  Dave could see that Mulgrum also seemed to forget that his ears were closed to all sounds, for he redoubled his efforts to haul the screen into its place.  \"I could not hear anything that was of any consequence,\" the steward heard the deaf mute say in a lower tone than his companion used.  \"Couldn't you hear anything?\" asked Mr. Lillyworth, making a spring at the canvas as though he was disgusted with the operations of his companion on the bridge.  \"Only what I have just told you,\" replied Mulgrum.  \"But you were at the door when the captain and the first lieutenant were talking together in the cabin,\" continued the officer in a low tone.  \"But they were talking about me, as I told you before,\" answered the scullion, rather impatiently, as though he too had a mind of his own.  \"Wasn't anything said about the operations of the future?\" demanded Mr. Lillyworth.  \"Not a word; but you know as well as I do that the captain has sealed orders which he will not see before to-morrow. I heard him tell his father that he was to open the envelope in latitude 38,\" said the supernumerary.  \"You must contrive some way to hear the captain when he reads his orders,\" continued the second lieutenant. \"He will be likely to have Mr. Flint with him when he opens the envelope.\"  \"It will be difficult,\" replied Mulgrum, and Dave could imagine that he saw him shake his head. \"The captain has found me cleaning the brasses on his door twice, and it will hardly do to be found at the door again.\"  \"Isn't there any place in his cabin where you can conceal yourself?\" inquired Mr. Lillyworth.  \"I don't know of any place, unless it is his state room; and the cabin steward has been at work there almost all the time since we got under way. Dave seems to be a sort of confidant of the captain,\" suggested Mulgrum; and it looked as though the deaf mute had not held his tongue and kept his ears open for nothing; but the steward could not understand how he had got this idea into his head, for he had received his instructions while the commander was at supper, and he was sure, as he had thrown the door open several times, that the scullion was not on the other side of it.  \"A nigger for his confidant!\" exclaimed the second lieutenant, as he interpolated a little jaw for the benefit of the seamen and petty officers within earshot of him. \"What can we expect when a mere boy is put in command of a steamer like this one?\"  \"I think you need not complain, Pawcett, for you are on board of this vessel, and so am I, because she is under the command of a boy. But he is a tremendous smart boy, and he is older than many men of double his age,\" added Mulgrum.  Dave realized that the supernumerary was well informed in regard to current history in connection with naval matters, and he was willing to believe that he was quite as shrewd as the officer at his side.  \"The boy is well enough, though he is abominably overrated, as you will see before I have done with him,\" said Mr. Lillyworth contemptuously. \"It is galling for one who has seen some service to touch his cap to this boy and call him captain.\"  \"I hope you are not forgetting yourself, Pawcett--\"  \"Don't mention my name on board of this vessel, Hungerford,\" interposed the officer.  \"And you will not mention mine,\" added the scullion promptly. \"We are both careless in this matter, and we must do better. I think I ought to caution you not to neglect any outside tokens of respect to the captain. You can have your own opinions, but I think you do not treat him with sufficient deference.\"  \"Perhaps I don't, for it is not an easy thing to do,\" replied the second lieutenant. \"But I think"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18617"],["title","On The Blockade (#8)"],["body","captain has no cause to complain of me. We must find out something about these orders, and you must be on the lookout for your chances at meridian to-morrow. If you can stow yourself away under the captain's berth in his state room, you may be able to hear him read them to the first lieutenant, as he will be sure to do.\"  \"I don't believe in doing that,\" replied Mulgrum. \"If I am discovered, no explanation could be made as to why I was concealed there.\"  \"But we must take some risks,\" persisted Mr. Lillyworth. \"After what you told me in the first of our talk, it may not be necessary to conceal yourself. I shall say something to the captain on the subject at which you hinted as soon as I get a chance. You may be in a situation to hear all that is said without danger.\"  Dave wondered what could be meant by this remark, for he had not heard the conversation between the captain and the first lieutenant which was intended as a \"blind\" to the listener, known to be at the door.  \"I am willing to take any risk that will not ruin our enterprise,\" Mulgrum responded to the remark of his companion.  \"At noon to-morrow I shall come on deck in charge, and the first lieutenant will be relieved, so that he will be at liberty to visit the captain in his cabin. That will be your time, and you must improve it.\"  \"But I shall meet you again to-morrow, and I will look about me, and see what can be done,\" said Mulgrum, as he made a new demonstration at the canvas screen.  \"I will keep my eyes open, and you must do the same. How is it with our men forward?\" asked the officer.  \"I have had no chance to speak with any of them, for they are all the time in the midst of the rest of the seamen,\" replied the deaf mute. \"But I have no doubt they are all right.\"  \"But you must have some way to communicate with them, or they might as well be on shore. As there are six of them, I should say you might get a chance to speak to one of them whenever you desire.\"  \"I have had nothing to say to them so far, and I have not considered the matter of communicating with them.\"  \"It is time to know how you can do so.\"  \"I can manage it in some way when the time comes,\" replied Mulgrum confidently. \"I am sure the captain and the first lieutenant have no suspicion that I am not what I seem to be. The executive officer put me through a full examination, especially in regard to Cherryfield, where I told him I used to live. I came off with flying colors, and I am certain that I am all right now.\"  Dave knew nothing about the examination to which Mr. Flint had subjected the deaf mute. It is evident that Mulgrum took an entirely different view of the result of the test from that taken by the examiner and the captain; but both of the latter had taken extreme pains to conceal their opinion from the subject of the test.  \"I think we had better not say anything more to-night, and you have been on the bridge long enough,\" said Mr. Lillyworth, walking to the windward end of the bridge, and peering out into the gloom of the night.  He had hardly looked in the direction of the deaf mute while he was on the bridge, but had busied himself with the lashing of the screen, and done everything he could to make it appear that he was not talking to his companion. Mulgrum, overhauling the screen as he proceeded, made his way to the steps by the side of the foremast. But he did not go down, as he had evidently intended to do, and waited till the second lieutenant came over to the lee side of the vessel.  \"Perhaps the man at the wheel has been listening to our conversation,\" said the deaf mute, plainly alarmed at the situation. \"I did not think of him.\"  \"I did,\" replied Mr. Lillyworth; \"but it is all right, and the man at the wheel is Spoors, one of our number.\"  \"All right,\" added Mulgrum, and he descended the steps.  Dave kept his place in the folds of the foresail, and hardly breathed as the scullion passed him. With the greatest caution, and after he had satisfied himself that no one was near enough to see him, he descended to the deck. He wandered about for a while, and saw that the supernumerary went to the galley, where, in the scarcity of accommodations for the extra persons on board, he was obliged to sleep on the floor. He was not likely to extend his operations any farther that night, and Dave went to the companion way, descended the steps, and knocked at the door of the captain's cabin.  \"Come in,\" called the occupant, who had been writing at his desk in the state room, though the door was open.  Dave presented himself before the commander, who was very glad to see him. Christy wiped the perspiration from his forehead, for he had evidently been working very hard all the evening. Four bells had just struck, indicating that it was ten o'clock in the evening. Flint's prediction in regard to the weather seemed to be in the way of fulfilment, for the Bronx had been leaping mildly on a head sea for the last hour. But everything was going well, and the motion of the vessel was as satisfactory to the commander in rough water as it had been in a smooth sea.  \"I am glad to see you, Dave,\" said Christy, as the steward presented himself at the door of the state room. \"I suppose from your coming to-night that you have something to tell me.\"  \"Yes, sir; I have; and I will give you the whole Gulf of Mexico if it isn't a big thing,\" replied Dave with his most expansive smile. \"You done get into a hornet's nest, Captain Passford.\"  \"Not so bad as that, I hope,\" replied Christy, laughing.  \"Bad enough, sir, at any rate,\" added Dave. \"Pink Mulgrum has been talking and listening to the second lieutenant all the evening.\"  \"Then he is not a deaf mute, I take it.\"  \"Not a bit of it; he can talk faster than I can, and he knows all about his grammar and dictionary. You have just eight traitors on board of the Bronx, Captain Passford,\" said Dave very impressively.  \"Only eight?\"  \"That's all I know about; and I think that is enough for one cruise in a Yankee ship.\"  \"Eight will do very well, Dave; but who are they?\" asked the captain with interest.  \"I know just three of them. One is the second lieutenant; Pink Mulgrum is another, and Spoors, one of the quartermasters, is the third. They didn't mention any more of them.\"  \"All right, Dave; now sit down on that stool, and tell me the whole story,\" said Christy, pointing to the seat.  The steward, believing that he had done a \"big thing\" that evening, did not hesitate to seat himself in the presence of the commander, and proceeded at once to relate all that he had done, and all that he had seen and heard on the bridge. When Dave had finished his story, and answered the questions put to him, the commander was willing to believe that he had done a big thing; though he said nothing beyond a few words of general commendation to the steward. Then he dismissed him, and, locking his desk, he went on deck. After taking an observation of the weather he mounted the bridge.     CHAPTER VIII  IMPORTANT INFORMATION, IF TRUE   \"Good evening, Mr. Lillyworth,\" said Captain Passford, when he reached the bridge.  \"Good evening, Captain Passford,\" replied the second lieutenant, as he touched his cap to his superior, galling as the act was, according to his own statement.  \"It looks as though we should have some wind,\" added the captain.  \"Yes, sir; and we shall have a nasty time of it across the Gulf Stream.\"  \"If there is any decided change in the weather during your watch, you will oblige me by having me called,\" added the captain; \"I think I am tired enough to turn in, for I have been very busy all the evening, copying letters and papers. I think I need a clerk almost as much as the captain of a frigate.\"  \"I think you ought to have one, sir,\" added Mr. Lillyworth, manifesting a deep interest in this matter.  \"As the matter now stands I have to use a good deal of my time in copying documents. By the way, if we fall in with any United States man-of-war, I wish to communicate with her.\"  \"Of course I shall report to you, sir, if one comes in sight during my watch,\" replied the second lieutenant, with a greater manifestation of zeal than he had before displayed in his relations with his commander, evidently profiting by the suggestion made to him by Pink Mulgrum.  \"But I hope we shall not fall in with one before day after tomorrow, for I have not copied all the letters I desire to use if such an occasion offers,\" said Captain Passford, who was really playing out a baited hook for the benefit of the second lieutenant, in regard to whose intentions he had no doubt since the revelations of the steward.  \"By the way, Captain Passford, what you say in regard to the amount of writing imposed upon you reminds me that there is a man on board who might afford you some relief from this drudgery. Possibly you may have noticed this man, though he is doing duty as a mere scullion.\"  \"Do you mean the man I have seen cleaning brass work about the cabin?\" asked Christy, glad to have the other take hold of the baited hook.  \"That is the one; he is deaf and dumb, but he has received a good education, and writes a good hand, and is rapid about it,\" added the second lieutenant, with some eagerness in his manner, though he tried to conceal it.  \"But my writing is of a confidential nature,\" replied the captain.  \"I have known this man, whose name is Pink Mulgrum, for some time. He is deaf and dumb, and you must have noticed him.\"  \"Oh, yes; I have seen him, and he had an interview with Mr. Flint in my presence. I observed that he wrote a good hand, and wrote very rapidly.\"  \"I am very confident that you can trust him with your papers, Captain Passford. He could not go into the service as a soldier or a sailor on account of his infirmity; but he desired to do something for his country. He was determined to go to the war, as he called it, in any capacity, even if it was as a scullion. He wrote me a letter to this effect, and Mr. Nawood consented to take him as a man of all work."]]]
