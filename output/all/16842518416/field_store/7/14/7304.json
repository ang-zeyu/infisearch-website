Huge masses of burning gas will be hurled forth on the wind and ignite the trees two and three hundred yards distant. Fortunately, fires of this type are not common, most of the blazes one is likely to encounter being ground fires, which are principally harmful in that they destroy the forest floor.\"  \"But I should have thought,\" said Wilbur, \"that such fires could only get a strong hold in isolated parts where nobody lives.\"  \"Not at all. Sometimes they begin quite close to the settlements, like the destructive fire at Hinckley, Minnesota, in 1894, which burned quietly for a week, and could have been put out by a couple of men without any trouble; but sometimes they start in the far recesses of the forest and reach their full fury very quickly. Of course, every fire, even the famous Peshtigo fire, started as a little bit of a blaze which either of you two boys could have put out.\"  \"How big a fire was that, sir?\" asked Fred.  \"It covered an area of over two thousand square miles.\"  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" ejaculated Wilbur after a rapid calculation, \"that would be a strip twenty miles wide and a hundred miles long.\"  The Chief Forester nodded.  \"It wiped the town of Peshtigo entirely off the map,\" he said. \"The people were hemmed in, ringed by fire on every side, and out of a population of two thousand, scarcely five hundred escaped. Flight was hopeless and rescue impossible.\"  \"And could this have been stopped after it got a hold at all?\" asked Wilbur seriously, realizing the gravity of the conditions that some day he might have to face. \"Could not something have been done?\"  \"It could have been prevented,\" said the Chief Forester fiercely, \"and as I said, in the first few hours either one of you boys could have put it out. But there have been many others like it since, and probably there will be many others yet to come. Even now, there are hundreds of towns and villages near forest lands utterly unprovided with adequate fire protection. Some of them are near our national forests, and it is our business to see that no danger comes to them.[1] Think of a fire like that of Peshtigo, think that if it had been stopped at the very beginning a thousand and a half lives would have been saved, and then ask yourself whether the work of a Forest Guard is not just about as fine a thing as any young fellow can do.\"  [Footnote 1: While this volume was in the press, forest fires of the utmost violence broke out in Idaho, Washington, and Montana. Over two hundred lives were lost, many of them of members of the Forest Service, and hundreds of thousands of acres of timber were destroyed.]  Wilbur turned impulsively to his chum.  \"You'll just have to join us, Fred,\" he said. \"I don't see how any one that knows anything about it can keep out. You could go to a forestry school this summer and start right in to get ready for it.\"  \"I'll think about it,\" said the older boy.  The Chief Forester was greatly pleased with the lad's eagerness to enroll his friend, and, turning to him, continued:  \"I don't want you to think it's all fire-fighting in the forest, though, Loyle; so I'll give you an idea of some of the other opportunities which will come your way in forest work. I suppose both of you boys hate a bully? I know I used to when I was at school.\"  \"I think,\" said Wilbur impetuously, \"that a bully's just about the worst ever.\"  \"I do, too,\" joined in Fred.  \"Well, you'll have a chance to put down a lot of bullying. You look surprised, eh? You don't see what bullying has to do with forestry? It has, a great deal, and I'll show you how. I suppose you know that a forest is a good deal like a school?\"  \"Well, no,\" admitted Wilbur frankly, \"I don't quite see how.\"  \"A forest is made up of a lot of different kind of trees, isn't it, just as a school is made up of a lot of boys? And each of these trees has an individuality, just in the same way that each boy has an individuality. That, of course, is easy to see. But what is more important, and much less known, is that just as the school as a whole gets to have a certain standard, so does the forest as a whole.\"  \"That seems queer,\" remarked Fred.  \"Perhaps it does, but it's true none the less. In many schools there are some boys bigger than others, but who are not good for as much, and they're always picking at the others and crowding them down. In the same way in a forest there are always some worthless trees, trying to crowd out the ones which are of more value. As the trees of better value are always sought for their timber, that gives the worthless stuff a good chance to get ahead. One of the duties of a Forester, looking after his section of the forest, is to see that every possible chance is given to the good over the bad.\"  \"It's really like having people to deal with!\" cried Fred in surprise. \"It sounds as if a tree were some kind of a human being.\"  \"There are lots of people,\" said the Chief Forester, \"who think of trees and speak of trees just exactly as if they were people like themselves. And it isn't even only the growing of the right kind of trees, but there are lots of ways of handling them under different conditions and at different ages. Thus, a Forester must be able to make his trees grow in height up to a certain stage, then stop their further growth upwards and make them put on diameter.\"  \"But how can you get a tree to grow in a certain way?\" asked Fred in utter amazement.  \"Get Loyle here to tell you all about it. I suppose you learned that at the Ranger School, didn't you?\" he added, turning to the younger boy.  \"Yes, sir. We had a very interesting course in silviculture.\"  \"But just to give you a rough idea, Fred,\" continued the Forester, \"you know that some trees need a lot of light. Consequently, if a number of young trees are left fairly close together, they will all grow up straight as fast as they can, without putting out any branches near the bottom, and all their growth will be of height.\"  \"See, Fred,\" interjected Wilbur, \"that's why saplings haven't got any twigs except just at the top.\"  \"Just so,\" said the Forester. \"Presently,\" he continued, \"as these young trees grow up together, one will overtop the rest. If the adjacent small trees be cut down when this tallest tree has reached a good height, it will spread at the top in order to get as much sunlight as possible. In order to carry a large top the diameter of the trunk must increase. So, by starting the trees close together and allowing one of them to develop alone after a certain height has been reached, the Forester has persuaded that tree first to grow straight and high, and then to develop girth, affording the finest and most valuable kind of lumber. That's just one small example of the scores of possibilities that lie in the hands of the expert Forester. By proper handling a forest can be made to respond to training, as I said, just as a school might do.\"  \"I can tell you a lot more things, Fred, just as wonderful as that,\" commented Wilbur.  The Chief Forester nodded.  \"I'd like to hear you myself,\" he said; \"I'd rather listen to something about trees than eat. But I've got to go now. I'll see you again soon, Loyle,\" and with a parting good wish to both boys, he crossed the street and went on his way.   [Illustration: A FOREST FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.

This uncle had been a great inspiration to Wilbur, for he was prominent in the Geological Survey, and had done some wonderful work in the Canyon of the Colorado. Wilbur hurried down at once.  \"Congratulations!\" the geologist said, as soon as the boy appeared. \"So you came through with flying colors, I hear.\"  \"Every one was just as fine as could be,\" answered the lad. \"But how did you know about it, uncle?\"  \"You wrote me that you were going to call on the Chief Forester to-day, and so I took the trouble to telephone to one of the men in the office who would be likely to know the result of your interview.\"  \"Isn't it bully?\"  \"Yes,\" said the older man with a quiet laugh, \"I think it is 'bully,' as you call it. But I didn't call only to congratulate you; I thought perhaps you would like to come with me to-night and meet some of the men in the Forest Service who are really doing things out West. If you do, there's no time to waste.\"  \"You bet I do,\" the boy replied hastily. \"But what is it all about?\"  \"It's a lecture on forestry in China, but it happens to come at the same time as a meeting of the District Foresters, so they're all in town. Trot along upstairs and get your hat, and we can talk about it on the way.\"  The geologist sauntered over to an acquaintance who was standing in the hotel lobby near by, but he had hardly exchanged half a dozen sentences with him when Wilbur reappeared, ready to go.  \"You see,\" said Masseth as they left the hotel, \"it is a good plan for you to meet as many of the leaders of your profession as you can, not only because their friendship may be useful to you, nor yet only because they are all pleasant fellows, but because forestry is a profession, a very large and complex one, and it is a revelation sometimes to see what can be made of it. I know myself, whenever I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18874"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Foresters (#3)"],["body","a great geologist I always feel a little better to think I can say, 'I am a geologist, too.' So you, I hope, may be able to say some day, 'I am a Forester, too.'\"  \"I'm one now,\" said Wilbur elatedly.  \"You're not, you're only a cub yet,\" corrected his uncle sharply; \"don't let your enthusiasm run away with your good sense. You are no more a Forester yet than a railroad bill-clerk is a transportation expert.\"  \"All right, uncle,\" said Wilbur, \"I'll swallow my medicine and take that all back. I'm not even the ghost of a Forester--yet.\"  \"You will meet the real article to-night. As I told you, the District Foresters are East for a conference, and this lecture is given before the Forestry Association. So you will have a good chance of sizing up the sort of men you are likely to be with.\"  \"Will the Forest Supervisors be there, too?\"  \"I should imagine not. There may be one or two in town. But the Supervisors alone would make quite a gathering if they were all here. There are over a hundred, are there not? You ought to know.\"  \"Just a hundred and forty-one now--about one to each forest.\"  \"And there are only six District Foresters?\"  \"Yes. One is in Montana, one in Colorado, one in New Mexico, one in Utah, one in California, and one in Oregon. And they have under their charge, so I learned to-day, nearly two hundred million acres of land, or, in other words, territory larger than the whole state of Texas and five times as large as England and Wales.\"  \"I had forgotten the figures,\" said the geologist. \"That gives each District Forester a little piece of land about the size of England to look after. And they can tell you, most of them, on almost every square mile of that region, approximately how much marketable standing timber may be found there, what kinds of trees are most abundant, and in what proportion, and roughly, how many feet of lumber can be cut to the acre. It's always been wonderful to me. That sort of thing takes learning, though, and you've got to dig, Wilbur, if you want to be a District Forester some day.\"  \"I'm going to get there some day, all right.\"  \"If you try hard enough, you may. By the way, there's one of them going in now. That's the house, on the other side of the Circle.\"  The boy looked across the curve and scanned all the men going in the same direction, quite with a feeling of companionship. One of the men who overtook and passed them, giving a hearty greeting to Masseth as he went by, was Roger Doughty, a young fellow who had distinguished himself in the Geological Survey, having taken a trip from south to north of Alaska, and Wilbur's companion felt a twinge of regret that his nephew had not entered his own service.  Wilbur, however, was always a \"woods\" boy, and even in his early childish days had been possessed with a desire to camp out. He had read every book he could lay hands on that dealt with \"the great outdoors,\" and would ten thousand times over rather have been Daniel Boone than George Washington. Seeing his intense pleasure in that life, his father had always allowed him to go off into the wilds for his holidays, and in consequence he knew many little tricks of woodcraft and how to make himself comfortable when the weather was bad. His father, who was a lawyer, had wanted him to enter that profession, but Wilbur had been so sure of his own mind, and was so persistent that at his request he had been permitted to go to the Colorado Ranger School. From this he had returned even more enthusiastic than before, and Masseth, seeing that by temperament Wilbur was especially fitted for the Forest Service, had urged the boy's father to allow him to enter for it, and did not attempt to conceal his satisfaction with Wilbur's success.  \"Why, Masseth, how did you get hold of Loyle?\" asked the Chief Forester as the two came up the walk together.  \"Didn't you know he was my nephew?\" was the surprised reply.  \"No,\" answered their host as they paused on the threshold, \"he never said anything to me about it.\"  The geologist looked inquiringly at his young relative.  \"I thought,\" said Wilbur, coloring, \"that if I said anything about knowing you, before I was appointed, it would look as though I had done it to get a pull. I didn't think it would do me any good, anyhow; and even if it had, I felt that I'd rather not get anything that way.\"  \"It wouldn't have helped you a bit,\" said the Chief Forester, \"and, as you see, you did not need it. I'm glad, too, that you did not mention it at the time.\" He nodded his appreciation of the boy's position as they passed into the room beyond.  The place was thoroughly typical of the gathering and the occasion. The walls were hung with some magnificent trophies, elk and moose heads, one stuffed fish of huge size was framed beside the door, and there were numberless photographs of trees and forests, cross-sections of woods, and comparisons of leaves and seeds. Although in the heart of Washington, there was a breath and fragrance in the room, which, to the boy, seemed like old times in the woods. The men, too, that were gathered there showed themselves to be what they were--men who knew the great wide world and loved it. Every man seemed hearty in manner and thoroughly interested in whatever was going on.  Masseth was called away, soon after they entered the room, and Wilbur, left to himself, sauntered about among the groups of talkers, looking at the various trophies hung on the walls. As he drew near to one of the smaller groups, however, he caught the word \"gun-play,\" so he edged up to the men and listened. One of them, seeing the lad, moved slightly to one side as an unspoken invitation to be one of them, and Wilbur stepped up.  The man who was speaking was comparing the present peaceful administration of the forests with the conditions that used to exist years ago, before the Service had been established, and when the Western \"bad man\" was at the summit of his power.  \"It was during the cattle and sheep war that a fellow had to be pretty quick on the draw,\" said one.  \"The Service had a good enough man for that, all right,\" suggested another member of the same group, \"there wasn't any of them who could pull a bead quicker than our grazing Chief yonder.\" Wilbur turned and saw crossing the room a quiet-looking, spare man, light-complexioned, and apparently entirely inoffensive. \"I guess they were ready enough to give him a wide berth when it came to gun-play.\"  \"Talking about the cattle war,\" said the first speaker, \"the worst trouble I ever had, or rather, the one that I hated to go into most, was back in those days. I was on the old Plum Creek Timber Land Reserve, now a portion of the Pike National Forest. A timber trespass sometimes leads to a very pretty scrap, and a cattle mix-up usually spells 'War' with a capital 'W,' but this had both.\"  \"You get them that way sometimes,\" said a middle-aged, red-headed man, who was standing by.  \"Had some down your way, too, I reckon?\"  \"Plenty of 'em. But go ahead with the yarn.\"  \"Well, this bunch that I'm speaking of had skipped out from Montana; they were 'wanted' there, and they had come down and started cutting railroad ties in a secluded canyon forming one of the branches of West Plum Creek. They were hated good and plenty, these same tie-cutters, because they had a reputation of being too handy with their guns, and consequently causing a decrease in the calf crop. The cattlemen used to drop in on them every once in a while, but the tie-cutters were foxy, and they were never caught with the goods. Of course, there was a moral certainty that they weren't buying meat, but nothing could be proved against them, and the interchanges of compliments, while lively and picturesque enough, never took the form of lead, although it was expected every time they met.\"  \"Had this been going on long?\"  \"Several months, I reckon,\" answered the former Ranger, \"before I heard of it. This was just before that section of the country was taken over by the Forest Service. As soon as notice was given that the district in question was to be placed under government regulations, a deputation to the tie-cutters loped down on their cow-ponies to convey the cheerful news. Expressing, of course, the profoundest sympathy for them, the spokesman of the cattle group volunteered the information that they could wrap up their axes in tissue paper, tie pink ribbons on their rifles and go home, because any one caught cutting timber on the reserve, now that it was a reserve, would go to the Pen for fifteen years.\"  \"What a bluff!\"  \"Bluff it certainly was. It didn't work, either. One of the tie-cutters in reply suggested that the cowmen should go back and devote their time to buying Navajo saddle-blankets and silver-mounted sombreros, since ornamenting the landscape was all they had to do in life; another replied that if a government inspector ever set eyes on their cattle he'd drive them off the range as a disgrace to the State; and a third capped the replies with the terse answer that no ten United States officers and no hundred and ten cattlemen could take them out alive.\"  \"That wouldn't make the cow-camp feel happy a whole lot,\" remarked the red-headed man.  \"There wasn't any shooting, though, as I said before, though just how it kept off I never rightly could understand. At all events they fixed it so that we heard of it in a hurry. Then both sides awaited developments. The tie-cutters kept their hands off the cattle for a while, and the cowmen had no special business with railroad ties, so that, aside from snorting at each other, no special harm was done.  \"But, of course, the timber trespass question had to be investigated, and the Supervisor, who was then located at Colorado Springs, arranged to make the trip with me to the tie-cutters' camp from a small station about fifty miles north of the Springs. I met him at the station as prearranged. We were just about to start when a telegram was handed him calling him to another part of the "]]]
