But now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the pond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or ten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.  It suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.  [Illustration]  It climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.  Then its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there pulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and flabby little wings.  Now is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like the taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.  Catbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and have been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown stiff.  If the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains motionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.  Its wings stretch out and harden.  Bright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and all at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a swift, beautiful winged creature.  Towards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about in every direction.  They seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there are ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and mosquitoes.  Mollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live where there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?  That is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.  Yes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larvæ, and took care of them until they changed into dragon flies.  Then what do you think happened?  As soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away and away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who had taken the trouble to raise them.  The dragon flies will not stay at home.  They fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.  They are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.  How do the larvæ get in the ponds? Frank is asking.  I will tell you what I know about it.  [Illustration]  The winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the water or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into larvæ.  The dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water to lay their eggs.  You all know why.  Yes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.  [Illustration]  The mother dragon fly knows the larvæ have to live in the water, and so she takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down under the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn't she a wise little mother?  There are a good many species of dragon flies.  Some are large and some are small.  Some are bright and some are dull.  There are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.  Some are marked with red and yellow.  They are a very gay family.  The dragon fly family is also a very old one.  Indeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.  Long before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human beings, there were dragon flies.  Don't you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a strange-looking insect?  It does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the pine trees.  Pine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago, before there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.  Now we must go home.  Good-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.  Good-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.  Good-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often again.  [Illustration]     THE FAIRY MAY FLIES  [Illustration]   Come, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing about.  What are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but they are like fairy demoiselles.  They are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.  See how they are tossed about.  Many have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.  They live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are called day flies, and also ephemeræ, which means short-lived.  They have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so tiny they cannot eat.  Strange little beings to come into the world so helpless!  How different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!  See their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out from the thorax.  Have they an abdomen?  See the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How they spread these threads out as they fly!  They have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the dragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.  [Illustration: DRAGON FLY WINGS.]  [Illustration: MAY FLY WINGS.]  Yes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.  The fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.  Richard asks, \"Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May flies?\"  Now, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall come first because it is easier to answer.  They are called May flies because they often come out in the month of May, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as July in appearing.  [Illustration]  We shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover where they come from.  See, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is it possible that _they_ are the larvæ of our fairy May flies? _They_ have a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.  And what do you suppose they eat?  No doubt they, too, live on animal food.  No doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.  You see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and mud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their soft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.  Their bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!  [Illustration]  The grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the surface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up and seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the May flies to escape these ravenous enemies.  The eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these queer-looking larvæ that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the dragon fly larvæ.  Those brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.  See the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the larva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so constantly.  The continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva supplied with fresh air.  Nellie is asking what gills are.  Well, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs and lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that often look like fringes or flat plates.  The gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through them. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen from the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the gills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the fish's body.  You see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the oxygen.  In insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes all through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the air that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes into the blood of the insect.  Yes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes to the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus is carried all through their bodies.  The blood takes the oxygen out of the air.  Without oxygen in the blood no animal could live.  Now let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a year, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for two long years!  In the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer day they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.  Pop! they are gone.  They were so quick about it we could not see what happened.  The larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged fairy from a prison cell.  They do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the dragon fly.  [Illustration]  They spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off skin in the pond.  Unless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish that are so fond of them.  But though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May flies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped about by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly to a bush near the water and stay a little while until this skin splits and comes off, and they are free.  In spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of the May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.  [Illustration here, as the text is broken]  It is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May flies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch the birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious feast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst of more delicacies than they can possibly use.  Fish like the May fly larvæ, too, which is probably the reason the larvæ have learned to live in the mud, out of reach.  Fishermen dig up the larvæ for bait, so you see the May flies have a hard time to get safely through the world.  But in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer day out they come trooping.  They spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic, hundreds and thousands,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],["title","The Insect Folk (#3)"],["body"," yes, millions of them. They fill the air, they cover everything.  The great naturalist Swammerdam, who was the first to make a thorough study of the May flies, thus tells us how they appeared in France one year:--  \"I then saw a sight beyond all expectation. The ephemeræ filled the air like the snowflakes in a dense snowstorm.  \"The steps were covered to a depth of two, three, or even four inches. A tract of water five or six feet across was completely hidden, and as the floating insects slowly drifted away, others took their places. Several times I was obliged to retreat to the top of the stairs from the annoyance caused by the ephemeræ, which dashed in my face, and got into my eyes, mouth, and nose.\"  These swarms of May flies appear only from three to five days at a time.  Wherever there are streams there are May flies, and the canals of Holland make good breeding places for them; no wonder, then, the Dutch, who you know live in Holland, have a saying, \"As thick as May flies.\"  Although so many of the May flies perish at once, multitudes of them drop their eggs into the water to renew the race of May flies.  Is it not wonderful that after so long a period of creeping about in the mud as larvæ, these graceful and beautiful little creatures have but a few hours in which to dance joyously about in the upper air on wings of gossamer? Some, indeed, live less than an hour, and some, that come out in the evening, finish their dance of life and perish before sunrise, without ever having seen the beautiful daylight.  Yes, strange little beings are they.  They do us no harm and we should not kill them.  Let them live their short lives and be happy.     THE STONE FLY FOLK  [Illustration]   John has been fishing.  What do you think he caught?  Nary fish, my dears, but a goodly number of stone flies, which he has brought to show us.  Yes, Mollie, they do remind us a very little of our May flies, only, of course, they are many times larger.  It is rather a clumsy creature in spite of its large wings, and John says he had no trouble whatever in catching it.  See, it has four wings, and the hind ones are the larger.  Yes, May, they fold up in plaits, like the sticks of a fan.  See its long antennæ and its compound eyes. Its eyes are not so large as are those of the dragon fly. It does not spend its time pursuing other insects, but is more like the May fly after it gets its wings.  Yes, Ned, it lives longer than the May fly, but it does not live very long, and it eats little.  It is a pretty little gray thing as it rests on the side of John's box, with its wings folded like a gossamer cloak over its body.  [Illustration]  It lays its eggs in the water, and out of them hatch little six-legged larvæ that are not troubled by want of appetite. If the winged stone fly does not eat, its larva does; it is like the other larvæ we know, always devouring something.  [Illustration]  Yes, Charlie, it feeds on living creatures, greatly relishing the larvæ of the May flies, or any other luckless insect infants it can capture.  It grows fast and moults several times, and when winter comes it hides away, only to come forth at the first breath of spring and continue its eating.  Like other larvæ that live under water, it does its breathing by means of gills, and these gills are in little tufts just above the base of each leg.  It lives under stones, which is why it is called the stone fly, and it slides quickly around a corner when you lift up its stone.  Fish are very fond of it, and hunt it as eagerly as it hunts larvæ. Since it makes good bait for brook trout, its life is always in danger. It finishes its growth in early summer, and emerges from its larval skin as a perfect winged insect.  Yes, indeed, John, you can often find dozens of the cast-off skins of the stone flies along the brook sides in the month of June.  The stone flies are harmless little people, and we should never kill one needlessly.  [Illustration]     THE SILVER FISH   May has something here for us to look at. She says it is a slippery rascal. Let us see it. Oh, yes, you have it in that little box. See, the box has a glass top. May cut the top off the box herself, and fastened in a little pane of glass so we could see the rascal without danger of its escaping.  [Illustration]  Pretty rascal! Like a little silver fish slipping about the box.  Yes, Charlie, it is called the silver fish. A land fish? Why, yes, it would be a land fish if it were a fish at all. But in spite of its name it is no fish. It is covered with shining scales, though, that are very much like fish scales, and it is shaped a good deal like a fish.  Oh, yes, it is an insect. You see it has six legs. But it has no wings.  No, it is not a young one.  It never will have any wings, no matter how old it may get to be.  It is flat, you see, and its scales make it very slippery, so that it is hard to catch and yet harder to hold on to after you have caught it. It goes flashing about like a little silver dart, and it loves to eat starch.  That is why May calls it a rascal. It eats the starch from the paste that fastens on her wall paper, and from book-bindings, so you see it makes things fall to pieces. But my! what a pretty rascal it is! Besides its name of silver fish, it is also called fish moth, though it is not a moth at all. It is also called bristle-tail, because of the long, bristle-like parts at the end of its body; and in some places it is called a slink, because, you know, it loves dark places, and when you uncover it in the daytime, it slips around a corner into the dark again.  Yes, it seems to slink about as if it were ashamed of itself, but it is not ashamed; it does not like the light, and it does not like us to see it.  Perhaps it is afraid of us.     ORTHOPTERA     THE OLD COCKROACHES  [Illustration]   Children, here is a cockroach.  It was one of the first insects that came to live on the earth; cockroaches were here before people, and they are here yet.  You do not think it is pretty?  Neither do I.  I don't know anybody who thinks a cockroach pretty.  Oh, no, it won't bite you.  It will only get into your pantry and eat your food.  It will walk around in the night and frighten you if you go suddenly into the kitchen.  It will not frighten you on purpose, but when it hears you coming, it will run, and then maybe you will scream and run too.  What is that, May? You've a good mind to scream and run as it is?  Very well, scream and run if you want to; the cockroach won't care.  We do not often see these big black fellows in the North, but sometimes we do. Down South cockroaches seem to be everywhere.  What, May? You are never going South, then?  Well, you do not need to go; the cockroaches won't care.  They have little heads and long antennæ, like threads.  What is that, May? You don't care anything about their heads? You don't want to know anything about cockroaches?  Oh, yes, you want to know about cockroaches. Remember how old they are.  They have six legs, you see.  You don't care how many legs they have?  Oh, yes, you do. They could not walk if they had no legs.  You wish they couldn't walk?  Dear me, May; you don't seem to like cockroaches.  Poor old cockroaches.  [Illustration]  Think how old they are.  What is that you say? They are old enough to know better?  Why, May, what have they ever done to you?  Nothing, only you don't like them?  Well, well, they don't like you, either. Poor old cockroaches; nobody seems to like them.  Perhaps they don't care.  Will you let me tell you where they came from?  They do not belong to this country.  Their natural home is tropical Asia.  You see, about four hundred years ago, the ships that bore fruits and other merchandise from India and other warm countries in Asia, bore, as well, a number of little, flat, reddish brown stowaways.  [Illustration]  Stowaways, as you know, are people that do not buy their tickets, but that hide among the ship's cargo, and so get free transportation to other countries.  Well, these little flat stowaways were not human beings, they were insects. Yes, May, they were the cockroaches.  When they landed from their hot land of Asia in cold England, they must have wondered what was to become of them. Many of them no doubt died, for they cannot stand cold weather at all; but some of them were carried, with the fruits and other things, quite unintentionally, of course, for nobody guessed they were there, into warm cellars and kitchen cupboards.  _Then_ they felt at home!  They knew better than to leave the cosey nooks where they could hide away and sleep all day, and when they came out at night would find a delicious supper close at hand.  They are great eaters, you know, so what with the good things in the pantry and the warmth of the kitchen quarters they prospered wherever they could find a kitchen to live in.  Soon they spread all over the large cities of England and finally into even remote country districts.  Of course they found their way to the United States of America, and in many houses in the North they have taken lodging. But down South, where it is always warm enough, they have prospered greatly, and they are there in far greater numbers than in the North.  Besides, there is a large American cockroach that belongs to tropical America, but that has found its way pretty well over the country. And there are cockroaches that live in the woods, some of them coming in the night to visit our houses and help themselves from our pantries.  Yes, Mollie, the cockroaches eat almost anything they can find, and what they do not eat they spoil by an ill-smelling liquid they give out when disturbed.  It is this liquid that makes the cockroaches so very offensive to us. We cannot bear to touch one because of it.  Cockroaches eat one variety of food that nobody objects to their having. They are fond of bed bugs and greedily devour them.  Besides the large, dark, reddish brown cockroaches there is a little tan-colored fellow"]]]
