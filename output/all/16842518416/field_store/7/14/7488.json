I gazed at her small, slim figure reclining in the deck chair. Her long, gray robe parted by design, I have no doubt, to display her shapely, satin-sheathed legs. Her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck; her carmine lips were parted with a mocking, alluring smile. The exotic perfume of her enveloped me.  She glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes.  \"Be serious,\" I added.  \"I am serious. Sober. Intoxicated by you, but sober.\"  I said, \"What sort of a contract?\"  \"A theater in Ferrok-Shahn. Good money, Gregg. I'll be there a year.\" She sat up to face me. \"There's a fellow here on the _Planetara_, Rance Rankin, he calls himself. At our table--a big, good-looking blond American. He says he is a magician. Ever hear of him?\"  \"That's what he told me. No, I never heard of him.\"  \"Nor did I. And I thought I had heard of everyone of importance. He is listed for the same theater I am. Nice sort of fellow.\" She paused, then added, \"If he's a professional entertainer, I'm a motor oiler.\"  It startled me. \"Why do you say that?\"  Instinctively my gaze swept the deck. An Earth woman and child and a small Venus man were in sight, but not within earshot.  \"Why do you look so furtive?\" she retorted. \"Gregg, there's something strange about this voyage. I'm no fool, nor you, so you must know it as well as I do.\"  \"Rance Rankin--\" I prompted.  She leaned closer toward me. \"He could fool you. But not me--I've known too many magicians.\" She grinned. \"I challenged him to trick me. You should have seen him evading!\"  \"Do you know Ob Hahn?\" I interrupted.  She shook her head. \"Never heard of him. But he told me plenty at breakfast. By Satan, what a flow of words that devil driver can muster! He and the Englishman don't mesh very well, do they?\"  She stared at me. I had not answered her grin; my mind was too busy with queer fancies. Halsey's words: \"Things are not always what they seem--\" Were these passengers masqueraders? Were they put here by George Prince? And then I thought of Miko the Martian, and the burn upon his arm.  \"Come back, Gregg! Don't go wandering off like that!\" She dropped her voice to a whisper. \"I'll be serious. I want to know what in hell is going on aboard this ship. I'm a woman and I'm curious. You tell me.\"  \"What do you mean?\" I parried.  \"I mean a lot of things. What we've just been talking about. And what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning?\"  \"Excitement?\"  \"Gregg, you may trust me.\" For the first time she was wholly serious. Her gaze made sure no one was within hearing. She put her hand on my arm. I could barely hear her whisper: \"I know they might have a ray upon us. I'll be careful.\"  \"They?\"  \"Anyone. Something's going on. You know it. You are in it. I saw you this morning, Gregg. Wild-eyed, chasing a phantom--\"  \"You?\"  \"And I heard the phantom! A man's footsteps. A magnetic, deflecting, invisible cloak. You couldn't fool an audience with that, it's too commonplace. If Rance Rankin tried--\"  I gripped her. \"Don't ramble, Venza! You saw me?\"  \"Yes. My stateroom door was open. I was sitting with a cigarette. I saw the purser in the smoking room. He was visible from--\"  \"Wait! Venza, that prowler went through the smoking room!\"  \"I know he did. I could hear him.\"  \"Did the purser hear him?\"  \"Of course. The purser looked up, followed the sound with his gaze. I thought that was queer. He never made a move. And then you came along and he acted innocent. Why? What's going on, that's what I want to know?\"  I held my breath. \"Venza, where did the prowler run to? Can you--\"  She whispered calmly, \"Into A20. I saw the door open and close. I even thought I could see his blurred outline.\" She added, \"Why should George Prince be sneaking around with you after him? And the purser acting innocent? And who is this George Prince, anyway?\"  The huge Martian, Miko, with his sister Moa came strolling along the deck. They nodded as they passed us.  I whispered, \"I can't explain anything now. But you're right, Venza: there is something going on. Listen! Whatever you learn--whatever you encounter which looks unusual--will you tell me? I ... well, I do trust you. Really I do, but the whole thing isn't mine to tell.\"  The somber pools of her eyes were shining. \"You are very lovable, Gregg. I won't question you.\" She was trembling with excitement. \"Whatever it is, I want to be in on it. Here's something I can tell you now. We've two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard. Do you know that?\"  \"Who are they?\"  \"Shac and Dud Ardley. Every detective in Greater New York knows them. They had a wonderful game with that Englishman, Sir Arthur, this morning. Stripped him of half a pound of eight-inch leaves--a neat little stack. A crooked game, of course. Those fellows are more nimble-fingered than Rance Rankin ever dared to be!\"  I sat staring at her. She was a mine of information, this girl.  \"And Gregg, I tried my charms on Shac and Dud. Nice men, but dumb. Whatever's going on, they're not in it. They wanted to know what kind of a ship this was. Why? Because Shac has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own. He had it working last night. He overheard George Prince and that giant Miko arguing about the Moon!\"  I gasped, \"Venza! Softer--\"  Against all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself upon me. Her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear.  \"Something about treasure on the Moon. Shac couldn't understand what. And they mentioned you. Then the purser joined them.\" Her whispered words tumbled over one another. \"A hundred pounds of gold leaf--that's the purser's price. He's with them--whatever it is. He promised to do something or other for them.\"  She stopped. \"Well?\" I prompted.  \"That's all. Shac's current was interrupted.\"  \"Tell him to try it again, Venza! I'll talk with him. No! I'd better let him alone. Can you get him to keep his mouth shut?\"  \"I think he might do anything I told him. He's a man!\"  \"Find out what you can.\"  She drew away from me abruptly. \"There's Anita and George Prince.\"  They came to the corner of the deck, but turned back. Venza caught my look. And understood it.  \"You do love Anita Prince, Gregg?\" Venza was smiling. \"I wish you.... I wish some man handsome as you would gaze after me like that.\" She turned solemn. \"You may be interested to know, she loves you. I could see it. I knew it when I mentioned you to her this morning.\"  \"Me? Why we've hardly spoken!\"  \"Is it necessary? I never heard that it was.\"  I could not see Venza's face; she stood up suddenly. And when I rose beside her, she whispered, \"We should not be seen talking so long. I'll find out what I can.\"  I stared after her slight robed figure as she turned into the lounge archway and vanished.     VI   Captain Carter was grim. \"So they've bought him off, have they? Go bring him in here, Gregg. We'll have it out with him now.\"  Snap, Dr. Frank, Balch, our first officer, and I were in the Captain's chart room. It was four P.M. Earth time. We were sixteen hours upon our voyage.  I found Johnson in his office in the lounge. \"Captain wants to see you. Close up.\"  He closed his window upon an American woman passenger who was demanding the details of Martian currency, and followed me forward. \"What is it, Gregg?\"  \"I don't know.\"  Captain Carter banged the slide upon us. The chart room was insulated. The hum of the current was obvious. Johnson noticed it. He stared at the hostile faces of the surgeon and Balch. And he tried to bluster.  \"What's this? Something wrong?\"  Carter wasted no words. \"We have information, Johnson, that there's some undercover plot aboard. I want to know what it is. Suppose you tell us.\"  The purser looked blank. \"What do you mean? We've gamblers aboard, if that's--\"  \"To hell with that,\" growled Balch. \"You had a secret interview with that Martian, _Set_ Miko, and with George Prince!\"  Johnson scowled from under his heavy brows, and then raised them in surprise. \"Did I? You mean changing their money? I don't like your tone, Balch. I'm not your under-officer!\"  \"But you're under me!\" roared the Captain. \"By God, I'm master here!\"  \"Well, I'm not disputing that,\" said the purser mildly. \"This fellow--\"  \"We're in no mood for argument,\" Dr. Frank cut in. \"Clouding the issue....\"  \"I won't let it be clouded,\" the Captain exclaimed.  I had never seen Carter so choleric. He added:  \"Johnson, you've been acting suspiciously. I don't give a damn whether I've proof of it or not. Did you or did you not meet George Prince and that Martian, last night?\"  \"No, I did not. And I don't mind telling you, Captain Carter, that your tone also is offensive!\"  \"Is it?\" Carter seized him. They were both big men. Johnson's heavy face went purplish red.  \"Take your hands--!\" They were struggling. Carter's hands were fumbling at the purser's pockets. I leaped, flung an arm around Johnson's neck, pinning him.  \"Easy there! We've got you, Johnson!\"  Snap tried to help me. \"Go on! Bang him on the head, Gregg. Now's your chance!\"  We searched him. A heat ray cylinder--that was legitimate. But we found a small battery and eavesdropping device similar to the one Venza had mentioned that Shac the gambler was carrying.  \"What are you doing with that?\" the Captain demanded.  \"None of your business! Is it criminal? Carter, I'll have the line officials dismiss you for this! Take your hands off me--all of you!\"  \"Look at this!\" exclaimed Dr. Frank.  From Johnson's breast pocket the surgeon drew a folded document. It was a scale drawing of the _Planetara_ interior corridors, the lower control rooms and mechanisms. It was always kept in Johnson's safe. And with it, another document: the ship's clearance papers--the secret code passwords for this voyage, to be used if we should be challenged by any Interplanetary Police ship.  Snap gasped, \"My God, that was in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19066"],["title","Brigands of the Moon (#6)"],["body","radio room strong box! I'm the only one on this vessel except the Captain who's entitled to know those passwords!\"  Out of the silence, Balch demanded, \"Well, what about it, Johnson?\"  The purser was still defiant. \"I won't answer your questions, Balch. At the proper time, I'll explain--Gregg Haljan, you're choking me!\"  I eased up. But I shook him. \"You'd better talk.\"  He was exasperatingly silent.  \"Enough!\" exploded Carter. \"He can explain when we get to port. Meanwhile I'll put him where he'll do no more harm. Gregg, lock him in the cage.\"  We ignored his violent protestations. The cage--in the old days of sea vessels on Earth, they called it the brig--was the ship's jail. A steel-lined, windowless room located under the deck in the peak of the bow. I dragged the struggling Johnson there, with the amazed watcher looking down from the observatory window at our lunging starlit forms.  \"Shut up, Johnson! If you know what's good for you--\"  He was making a fearful commotion. Behind us, where the deck narrowed at the superstructure, half a dozen passengers were gazing in surprise.  \"I'll have you thrown out of the service, Gregg Haljan!\"  I shut him up finally. And flung him down the ladder into the cage and sealed the deck trap door upon him. I was headed back for the chart room when from the observatory came the lookout's voice:  \"An asteroid, Haljan! Officer Blackstone wants you.\"  I hurried to the turret bridge. An asteroid was in sight. We had nearly attained our maximum speed now. An asteroid was approaching, so dangerously close that our trajectory would have to be altered. I heard Blackstone's signals ringing in the control rooms; and met Carter as he ran to the bridge with me.  \"That scoundrel! We'll get more out of him, Gregg. By God, I'll put the chemicals on him--torture him--illegal or not!\"  We had no time for further discussion. The asteroid was rapidly approaching. Already, under the glass, it was a magnificent sight. I had never seen this tiny world before--asteroids are not numerous between the Earth and Mars, or in toward Venus.  At a speed of nearly a hundred miles a second the asteroid swept into view. With the naked eye, at first it was a tiny speck of star-dust unnoticeable in the gem-strewn black velvet of space. A speck. Then a gleaming dot, silver white, with the light of our Sun upon it.  I stood with Carter and Blackstone on the turret bridge. It was obvious, that unless we altered our course, the asteroid would pass too close for safety. Already we were feeling its attraction; from the control rooms came the report that our trajectory was disturbed by this new mass so near.  \"Better make your calculations now, Gregg,\" Blackstone urged.  I cast up the rough elements from the observational instruments in the turret. When I had us upon our new course, with the attractive and repulsive plates in the _Planetara's_ hull set in their altered combinations, I went to the bridge again.  The asteroid hung over our bow quarter. No more than twenty or thirty thousand miles away. A giant ball now, filling all that quadrant of the heavens. The configurations of its mountains, its land and water areas, were plainly visible.  \"Perfectly habitable,\" Blackstone said. \"But I've searched all over the hemisphere with the glass. No sign of human life--certainly nothing civilized--nothing in the fashion of cities.\"  A fair little world, by the look of it. A tiny globe, come from the region beyond Neptune. We swept past the asteroid. The passengers were all gathered to view the passing little world. I saw, not far from me, Anita, standing with her brother; and the giant figure of Miko with them. Half an hour since this wandering little world had showed itself, it swiftly passed, began to dwindle behind us. A huge half moon. A thinner, smaller quadrant. A tiny crescent, like a silver barpin to adorn some lady's breast. And then it was a dot, a point of light indistinguishable among the myriad others hovering in this great black void.  The incident of the passing of the asteroid was over. I turned from the deck window. My heart leaped. The moment for which all day I had been subconsciously longing was at hand. Anita was sitting in a deck chair, momentarily alone. Her gaze was on me as I glanced her way, and she smiled an invitation for me to join her.     VII   \"But, Miss Prince, why are you and your brother going to Ferrok-Shahn? His business--\"  Even as I voiced it, I hated myself for such a question. So nimble in the humble mind that mingled with my rhapsodies of love, was my need for information of George Prince.  \"Oh,\" she said. \"This is pleasure, not business, for George.\" It seemed to me that a shadow crossed her face. But it was gone in an instant, and she smiled. \"We have always wanted to travel. We are alone in the world, you know--our parents died when we were children.\"  I filled in her pause. \"You will like Mars. So many interesting things to see.\"  She nodded. \"Yes, I understand so. Our Earth is so much the same all over, cast all in one mould.\"  \"But a hundred or more years ago, it was not, Miss Prince. I have read how the picturesque Orient, differing from ... well, Greater New York or London, for instance--\"  \"Transportation did that,\" she interrupted eagerly. \"Made everything the same--the people all look alike ... dress alike.\"  We discussed it. She had an alert, eager mind, childlike with its curiosity, yet strangely matured. And her manner was naïvely earnest. Yet this was no clinging vine, this Anita Prince. There was a firmness, a hint of masculine strength in her chin and in her manner.  \"If I were a man, what wonders I could achieve in this marvelous age!\" Her sense of humor made her laugh at herself. \"Easy for a girl to say that,\" she added.  \"You have greater wonders to achieve, Miss Prince,\" I said impulsively.  \"Yes? What are they?\" She had a very frank and level gaze, devoid of coquetry.  My heart was pounding. \"The wonders of the next generation. A little son, cast in your own gentle image--\"  What madness, this clumsy, brash talk! I choked it off.  But she took no offense. The dark rose-petals of her cheeks were mantled deeper red, but she laughed.  \"That is true.\" She turned abruptly serious. \"I should not laugh. The wonders of the next generation--conquering humans marching on....\" Her voice trailed away. My hand went to her arm. Strange tingling something which poets call love! It burned and surged through my trembling fingers into the flesh of her forearm.  The starlight glowed in her eyes. She seemed to be gazing, not at the silver-lit deck, but away into distant reaches of the future.  Our moment. Just a breathless moment given us as we sat there with my hand burning her arm, as though we both might be seeing ourselves joined in a new individual--a little son, cast in his mother's gentle image and with the strength of his father. Our moment, and then it was over. A step sounded. I sat back. The giant gray figure of Miko came past, his great cloak swaying, with his clanking sword ornament beneath it. His bullet head, with its close-clipped hair, was hatless. He gazed at us, swaggering past, and turned the deck corner.  Our moment was gone. Anita said conventionally, \"It has been pleasant to talk with you, Mr. Haljan.\"  \"But we'll have many more,\" I said. \"Ten days--\"  \"You think we'll reach Ferrok-Shahn on schedule?\"  \"Yes. I think so.... As I was saying, Miss Prince, you'll enjoy Mars. A strange, aggressively forward-looking people.\"  An oppression seemed on her. She stirred in her chair.  \"Yes they are,\" she said vaguely. \"My brother and I know many Martians in Greater New York.\" She checked herself abruptly. Was she sorry she had said that? It seemed so.  Miko was coming back. He stopped this time. \"Your brother would see you, Anita. He sent me to bring you to his room.\"  The glance he shot me had a touch of insolence. I stood up and he towered a head over me.  Anita said, \"Oh yes. I'll come.\"  I bowed. \"I will see you again, Miss Prince. I thank you for a pleasant half-hour.\"  The Martian led her away. Her little figure was like a child with a giant. It seemed, as they passed the length of the deck, with me staring after them, that he took her arm roughly. And that she shrank from him in fear.  And they did not go inside. As though to show me that he had merely taken her from me, he stopped at a distant deck window and stood talking to her. Once he picked her up as one would pick up a child to show it some distant object through the window.  Was Anita afraid of this Martian's wooing? Yet was held to him by some power he might have over her brother? The vagrant thought struck me.     VIII   The rest of that afternoon and evening were a blank confusion to me. Anita's words, the touch of my hand on her arm, that vast realm of what might be for us, like the glimpse of a magic land of happiness which I had seen in her eyes, and perhaps she had seen in mine--all this surged within me.  After wandering about the ship, I had a brief consultation with Captain Carter. He was genuinely apprehensive now. The _Planetara_ carried only a half-dozen of the heat-ray projectors, no long range weapons, a few side arms, and some old-fashioned, practically antiquated weapons of explosives, plus hand projectors with the new Benson curve light.  The weapons were all in Carter's chart room, save the few we officers always carried. Carter was afraid, but of what, he was not sure. He had not thought that our plan to stop at the Moon could affect this outward voyage. He had thought that any danger would occur on the way back, and then the _Planetara_ would have been adequately guarded and manned with police-soldiers.  But now we were practically defenseless. I had a moment with Venza, but she had nothing new to communicate. And for half an hour I chatted with George Prince. He seemed a gay, pleasant young man. I could almost have fancied I liked him. Or was it because he was Anita's brother?"]]]
