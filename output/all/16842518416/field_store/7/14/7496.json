So they rode on some miles farther; the day was warm, the sun shone hot, and the Princess grew thirsty once more. And when they came to a water-course she called again to the waiting-woman and said,  \"Get down, and give me to drink out of my golden cup.\" For she had forgotten all that had gone before. But the waiting-woman spoke still more scornfully and said,  \"If you want a drink, you may get it yourself; I am not going to be your slave.\"  So, as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get off her horse and to stoop towards the running water to drink, and as she stooped, she wept and said, \"Oh dear!\" And the three drops of blood heard her and answered,  \"If your mother knew of this, it would break her heart!\"  And as she drank and stooped over, the napkin on which were the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom and floated down the stream, and in her distress she never noticed it; not so the waiting-woman, who rejoiced because she should have power over the bride, who, now that she had lost the three drops of blood, had become weak, and unable to defend herself. And when she was going to mount her horse again the waiting-woman cried,  \"Falada belongs to me, and this jade to you.\" And the Princess had to give way and let it be as she said. Then the waiting-woman ordered the Princess with many hard words to take off her rich clothing and to put on her plain garments, and then she made her swear to say nothing of the matter when they came to the royal court; threatening to take her life if she refused. And all the while Falada noticed and remembered.  The waiting-woman then mounting Falada, and the Princess the sorry jade, they journeyed on till they reached the royal castle. There was great joy at their coming, and the King's son hastened to meet them, and lifted the waiting woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride; and then he led her up the stairs, while the real Princess had to remain below. But the old King, who was looking out of the window, saw her standing in the yard, and noticed how delicate and gentle and beautiful she was, and then he went down and asked the seeming bride who it was that she had brought with her and that was now standing in the courtyard.  \"Oh!\" answered the bride, \"I only brought her with me for company; give the maid something to do, that she may not be for ever standing idle.\"  But the old King had no work to give her; until he bethought him of a boy he had who took care of the geese, and that she might help him. And so the real Princess was sent to keep geese with the goose-boy, who was called Conrad.  Soon after the false bride said to the Prince,  \"Dearest husband, I pray thee do me a pleasure.\"  \"With all my heart,\" answered he.  \"Then\" said she, \"send for the knacker, that he may carry off the horse I came here upon, and make away with him; he was very troublesome to me on the journey.\" For she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the Princess. And when the order had been given that Falada should die, it came to the Princess's ears, and she came to the knacker's man secretly, and promised him a piece of gold if he would do her a service. There was in the town a great dark gate-way through which she had to pass morning and evening with her geese, and she asked the man to take Falada's head and to nail it on the gate, that she might always see it as she passed by. And the man promised, and he took Falada's head and nailed it fast in the dark gate-way.  Early next morning as she and Conrad drove their geese through the gate, she said as she went by,      \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"  And the head answered,      \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?     But if thy mother knew thy pain,     Her heart would surely break in twain.\"  But she went on through the town, driving her geese to the field. And when they came into the meadows, she sat down and undid her hair, which was all of gold, and when Conrad saw how it glistened, he wanted to pull out a few hairs for himself. And she said,      \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,     Make him run after as it flies,     While I with my gold hair will play,     And twist it up in seemly wise.\"  Then there came a wind strong enough to blow Conrad's hat far away over the fields, and he had to run after it; and by the time he came back she had put up her hair with combs and pins, and he could not get at any to pull it out; and he was sulky and would not speak to her; so they looked after the geese until the evening came, and then they went home.  The next morning, as they passed under the dark gate-way, the Princess said,      \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"  And Falada answered,      \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?     But if thy mother knew thy pain,     Her heart would surely break in twain.\"  And when they reached the fields she sat down and began to comb out her hair; then Conrad came up and wanted to seize upon some of it, and she cried,      \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,     Make him run after as it flies,     While I with my gold hair will play,     And do it up in seemly wise.\"  Then the wind came and blew Conrad's hat very far away, so that he had to run after it, and when he came back again her hair was put up again, so that he could pull none of it out; and they tended the geese until the evening.  And after they had got home, Conrad went to the old King and said, \"I will tend the geese no longer with that girl!\"  \"Why not?\" asked the old King.  \"Because she vexes me the whole day long,\" answered Conrad. Then the old King ordered him to tell how it was.  \"Every morning,\" said Conrad, \"as we pass under the dark gate-way with the geese, there is an old horse's head hanging on the wall, and she says to it,      \"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"  And the head answers,      \"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?     But if thy mother knew thy pain,     Her heart would surely break in twain.\"  And besides this, Conrad related all that happened in the fields, and how he was obliged to run after his hat.  The old King told him to go to drive the geese next morning as usual, and he himself went behind the gate and listened how the maiden spoke to Falada; and then he followed them into the fields, and hid himself behind a bush; and he watched the goose-boy and the goose-girl tend the geese; and after a while he saw the girl make her hair all loose, and how it gleamed and shone. Soon she said,      \"O wind, blow Conrad's hat away,     And make him follow as it flies,     While I with my gold hair will play,     And bind it up in seemly wise.\"  Then there came a gust of wind and away went Conrad's hat, and he after it, while the maiden combed and bound up her hair; and the old King saw all that went on. At last he went unnoticed away, and when the goose-girl came back in the evening he sent for her, and asked the reason of her doing all this.  \"That I dare not tell you,\" she answered, \"nor can I tell any man of my woe, for when I was in danger of my life I swore an oath not to reveal it.\" And he pressed her sore, and left her no peace, but he could get nothing out of her. At last he said,  \"If you will not tell it me, tell it to the iron oven,\" and went away. Then she crept into the iron oven, and began to weep and to lament, and at last she opened her heart and said,  \"Here I sit forsaken of all the world, and I am a King's daughter, and a wicked waiting-woman forced me to give up my royal garments and my place at the bridegroom's side, and I am made a goose-girl, and have to do mean service. And if my mother knew, it would break her heart.\"  Now the old King was standing outside by the oven-door listening, and he heard all she said, and he called to her and told her to come out of the oven. And he caused royal clothing to be put upon her, and it was a marvel to see how beautiful she was. The old King then called his son and proved to him that he had the wrong bride, for she was really only a waiting-woman, and that the true bride was here at hand, she who had been the goose-girl. The Prince was glad at heart when he saw her beauty and gentleness; and a great feast was made ready, and all the court people and good friends were bidden to it. The bridegroom sat in the midst with the Princess on one side and the waiting-woman on the other; and the false bride did not know the true one, because she was dazzled with her glittering braveries. When all the company had eaten and drunk and were merry, the old King gave the waiting-woman a question to answer, as to what such an one deserved, who had deceived her masters in such and such a manner, telling the whole story, and ending by asking,  \"Now, what doom does such an one deserve?\"  \"No better than this,\" answered the false bride, \"that she be put naked into a cask, studded inside with sharp nails, and be dragged along in it by two white horses from street to street, until she be dead.\"  \"Thou hast spoken thy own doom,\" said the old King; \"as thou hast said, so shall it be done.\" And when the sentence was fulfilled, the Prince married the true bride, and ever after they ruled over their kingdom in peace and blessedness.     THE RAVEN   THERE was once a Queen and she had a little daughter, who was as yet a babe in arms; and once the child was so restless that the mother could get no peace, do what she would; so she lost patience, and seeing a flight of ravens passing over the castle, she opened the window and said to her child,  \"Oh, that thou wert a raven and couldst fly away, that I might be at peace.\"  No sooner had she uttered the words, than the child was indeed changed into a raven, and fluttered from her arms out of the window. And she flew into a dark wood and stayed there a long time, and her parents knew nothing of her. Once a man was passing through the wood, and he heard the raven cry, and he followed the voice; and when he came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],["title","Household Stories (#5)"],["body"," it said,  \"I was born a King's daughter, and have been bewitched, but thou canst set me free.\"  \"What shall I do?\" asked the man.  \"Go deeper into the wood,\" said she, \"and thou shalt find a house and an old woman sitting in it: she will offer thee meat and drink, but thou must take none; if thou eatest or drinkest thou fallest into a deep sleep, and canst not set me free at all. In the garden behind the house is a big heap of tan, stand upon that and wait for me. Three days, at about the middle of the day, shall I come to thee in a car drawn by four white horses the first time, by four red ones the second time, and lastly by four black ones; and if thou art not waking but sleeping, thou failest to set me free.\"  The man promised to do all she said.  \"But ah!\" cried she, \"I know quite well I shall not be set free of thee; something thou wilt surely take from the old woman.\"  But the man promised yet once more that certainly he would not touch the meat or the drink. But when he came to the house the old woman came up to him.  \"My poor man,\" said she to him, \"you are quite tired out, come and be refreshed, and eat and drink.\"  \"No,\" said the man, \"I will eat and drink nothing.\"  But she left him no peace, saying,  \"Even if you eat nothing, take a draught out of this cup once and away.\"  So he was over-persuaded, and he drank.  In the afternoon, about two o'clock, he went out into the garden to stand upon the tan-heap and wait for the raven. As he stood there he felt all at once so tired, that he could bear it no longer, and laid himself down for a little; but not to sleep. But no sooner was he stretched at length than his eyes closed of themselves, and he fell asleep, and slept so sound, as if nothing in the world could awaken him.  At two o'clock came the raven in the car drawn by four white horses, but she was sad, knowing already that the man would be asleep, and so, when she came into the garden, there he lay sure enough. And she got out of the car and shook him and called to him, but he did not wake. The next day at noon the old woman came and brought him meat and drink, but he would take none. But she left him no peace, and persuaded him until he took a draught out of the cup. About two o'clock he went into the garden to stand upon the tan-heap, and to wait for the raven, but he was overcome with so great a weariness that his limbs would no longer hold him up; and whether he would or no he had to lie down, and he fell into a deep sleep. And when the raven came up with her four red horses, she was sad, knowing already that the man would be asleep. And she went up to him, and there he lay, and nothing would wake him.  The next day the old woman came and asked what was the matter with him, and if he wanted to die, that he would neither eat nor drink; but he answered,  \"I neither can nor will eat and drink.\"  But she brought the dishes of food and the cup of wine, and placed them before him, and when the smell came in his nostrils he could not refrain, but took a deep draught. When the hour drew near, he went into the garden and stood on the tan-heap to wait for the king's daughter; as time went on he grew more and more weary, and at last he laid himself down and slept like a stone. At two o'clock came the raven with four black horses, and the car and all was black; and she was sad, knowing already that he was sleeping, and would not be able to set her free; and when she came up to him, there he lay and slept. She shook him and called to him, but she could not wake him. Then she laid a loaf by his side and some meat, and a flask of wine, for now, however much he ate and drank, it could not matter. And she took a ring of gold from her finger, and put it on his finger, and her name was engraven on it. And lastly she laid by him a letter, in which was set down what she had given him, and that all was of no use, and further also it said,  \"I see that here thou canst not save me, but if thy mind is to the thing, come to the golden castle of Stromberg: I know well that if thou willst thou canst.\" And when all this was done, she got again into her car, and went to the golden castle of Stromberg.  When the man waked up and perceived that he had been to sleep, he was sad at heart to think that she had been, and gone, and that he had not set her free. Then, catching sight of what lay beside him, he read the letter that told him all. And he rose up and set off at once to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, though he knew not where it was. And when he had wandered about in the world for a long time, he came to a dark wood, and there spent a fortnight trying to find the way out, and not being able. At the end of this time, it being towards evening, he was so tired that he laid himself down under a clump of bushes and went to sleep. The next day he went on again, and in the evening, when he was going to lie down again to rest, he heard howlings and lamentations, so that he could not sleep. And about the hour when lamps are lighted, he looked up and saw a light glimmer in the forest; and he got up and followed it, and he found that it came from a house that looked very small indeed, because there stood a giant before it. And the man thought to himself that if he were to try to enter and the giant were to see him, it would go hard but he should lose his life. At last he made up his mind, and walked in. And the giant saw him.  \"I am glad thou art come,\" said he; \"it is now a long time since I have had anything to eat; I shall make a good supper of thee.\"  \"That may be,\" said the man, \"but I shall not relish it; besides, if thou desirest to eat, I have somewhat here that may satisfy thee.\"  \"If that is true,\" answered the giant, \"thou mayest make thy mind easy; it was only for want of something better that I wished to devour thee.\"  Then they went in and placed themselves at the table, and the man brought out bread, meat, and wine in plenty.  \"This pleases me well,\" said the giant, and he ate to his heart's content. After a while the man asked him if he could tell him where the golden castle of Stromberg was.  \"I will look on my land-chart,\" said the giant, \"for on it all towns and villages and houses are marked.\"  So he fetched the land-chart which was in his room, and sought for the castle, but it was not to be found.  \"Never mind,\" said he, \"I have up-stairs in the cupboard much bigger maps than this; we will have a look at them.\" And so they did, but in vain.  And now the man wanted to pursue his journey, but the giant begged him to stay a few days longer, until his brother, who had gone to get in a store of provisions, should return. When the brother came, they asked him about the golden castle of Stromberg.  \"When I have had time to eat a meal and be satisfied, I will look at the map.\"  That being done, he went into his room with them, and they looked at his maps, but could find nothing: then he fetched other old maps, and they never left off searching until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.  \"How shall I ever get there?\" said the man.  \"I have a couple of hours to spare,\" said the giant, \"and I will set you on your way, but I shall have to come back and look after the child that we have in the house with us.\"  Then the giant bore the man until within about a hundred hours' journey from the castle, and saying,  \"You can manage the rest of the way by yourself,\" he departed; and the man went on day and night, until at last he came to the golden castle of Stromberg. It stood on a mountain of glass, and he could see the enchanted Princess driving round it, and then passing inside the gates. He was rejoiced when he saw her, and began at once to climb the mountain to get to her; but it was so slippery, as fast as he went he fell back again. And when he saw this he felt he should never reach her, and he was full of grief, and resolved at least to stay at the foot of the mountain and wait for her. So he built himself a hut, and sat there and waited a whole year; and every day he saw the Princess drive round and pass in, and was never able to reach her.  One day he looked out of his hut and saw three robbers fighting, and he called out, \"Mercy on us!\" Hearing a voice, they stopped for a moment, but went on again beating one another in a dreadful manner. And he cried out again, \"Mercy on us!\" They stopped and listened, and looked about them, and then went on again. And he cried out a third time, \"Mercy on us!\" and then, thinking he would go and see what was the matter, he went out and asked them what they were fighting for. One of them told him he had found a stick which would open any door only by knocking at it; the second said he had found a cloak which, if he put it on, made him invisible; the third said he was possessed of a horse that would ride over everything, even the glass mountain. Now they had fought because they could not agree whether they should enjoy these things in common or separately.  \"Suppose we make a bargain,\" said the man; \"it is true I have no money, but I have other things yet more valuable to exchange for these; I must, however, make trial of them beforehand, to see if you have spoken truth concerning them.\"  So they let him mount the horse, and put the cloak round him, and they gave him the stick into his hand, and as soon as he had all this he was no longer to be seen; but laying about him well, he gave them all a sound thrashing, crying out,  \"Now, you good-for-nothing fellows, you have got what you deserve; perhaps you will be satisfied now!\"  Then he rode up the glass mountain, and when he reached the castle gates he found them locked; but he beat with his stick upon the door and it opened at once. And he walked in, and up the stairs to the great room where sat the Princess with a golden cup and wine before her: she could not see him so long as the cloak was on him, but drawing near to her he pulled off the ring she had given him, and threw it into"]]]
