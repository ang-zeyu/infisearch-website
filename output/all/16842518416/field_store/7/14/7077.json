It arrived, somewhat tardily, only last night, or I should not have had it with me.  I wore the same dress to the post-office yesterday that I wore to the Hen Conference to- day, and so it chanced to be still in the pocket.  If it had been anything I valued, of course I should have lost or destroyed it by mistake; it is only silly, worthless little things like this that keep turning up and turning up after one has forgotten their existence.     \"You are a mystery!\" [it ran.]  \"I can apprehend, but not comprehend    you.  I know you in part.  I understand various bits of your nature;    but my knowledge is always fragmentary and disconnected, and when I    attempt to make a whole of the mosaics I merely get a kaleidoscopic    effect.  Do you know those geographical dissected puzzles that they    give to children?  You remind me of one of them.     \"I have spent many charming (and dangerous) hours trying to 'put you    together'; but I find, when I examine my picture closely, that after    all I've made a purple mountain grow out of a green tree; that my    river is running up a steep hillside; and that the pretty milkmaid,    who should be wandering in the forest, is standing on her head with    her pail in the air     \"Do you understand yourself clearly?  Or is it just possible that when    you dive to the depths of your own consciousness, you sometimes find    the pretty milkmaid standing on her head?  I wonder!\" . . .  Ah, well, it is no wonder that he wonders!   So do I, for that matter!     CHAPTER XII   {Along the highway: p89.jpg}  July 17th.  Thornycroft Farm seems to be the musical centre of the universe.  When I wake very early in the morning I lie in a drowsy sort of dream, trying to disentangle, one from the other, the various bird notes, trills, coos, croons, chirps, chirrups, and warbles.  Suddenly there falls on the air a delicious, liquid, finished song; so pure, so mellow, so joyous, that I go to the window and look out at the morning world, half awakened, like myself.  There is I know not what charm in a window that does not push up, but opens its lattices out into the greenness.  And mine is like a little jewelled door, for the sun is shining from behind the chimneys and lighting the tiny diamond panes with amber flashes.  A faint delicate haze lies over the meadow, and rising out of it, and soaring toward the blue is the lark, flinging out that matchless matin song, so rich, so thrilling, so lavish!  As the blithe melody fades away, I hear the plaintive ballad-fragments of the robin on a curtsying branch near my window; and there is always the liquid pipe of the thrush, who must quaff a fairy goblet of dew between his songs, I should think, so fresh and eternally young is his note.  There is another beautiful song that I follow whenever I hear it, straining my eyes to the treetops, yet never finding a bird that I can identify as the singer.  Can it be the--     \"Ousel-cock so black of hue,    With orange-tawny bill\"?  He is called the poet-laureate of the primrose time, but I don't know whether he sings in midsummer, and I have not seen him hereabouts.  I must write and ask my dear Man of the North.  The Man of the North, I sometimes think, had a Fairy Grandmother who was a robin; and perhaps she made a nest of fresh moss and put him in the green wood when he was a wee bairnie, so that he waxed wise in bird-lore without knowing it.  At all events, describe to him the cock of a head, the glance of an eye, the tip- up of a tail, or the sheen of a feather, and he will name you the bird. Near-sighted he is, too, the Man of the North, but that is only for people.  The Square Baby and I have a new game.  I bought a doll's table and china tea-set in Buffington.  We put it under an apple-tree in the side garden, where the scarlet lightning grows so tall and the Madonna lilies stand so white against the flaming background.  We built a little fence around it, and every afternoon at tea-time we sprinkle seeds and crumbs in the dishes, water in the tiny cups, drop a cherry in each of the fruit-plates, and have a _the chantant_ for the birdies.  We sometimes invite an \"invaleed\" duckling, or one of the baby rabbits, or the peacock, in which case the cards read:--     _Thornycroft Farm_.    The pleasure of your company is requested    at a    _The Chantant_    Under the Apple Tree.    Music at five.  It is a charming game, as I say, but I'd far rather play it with the Man of the North; he is so much younger than the Square Baby, and so much more responsive, too.  {The scent of the hay: p92.jpg}  Thornycroft Farm is a sweet place, too, of odours as well as sounds.  The scent of the hay is for ever in the nostrils, the hedges are thick with wild honeysuckle, so deliciously fragrant, the last of the June roses are lingering to do their share, and blackberry blossoms and ripening fruit as well.  I have never known a place in which it is so easy to be good.  I have not said a word, nor scarcely harboured a thought, that was not lovely and virtuous since I entered these gates, and yet there are those who think me fantastic, difficult, hard to please, unreasonable!  {The last of June: p93.jpg}  I believe the saints must have lived in the country mostly (I am certain they never tried Hydropathic hotels), and why anybody with a black heart and natural love of wickedness should not simply buy a poultry farm and become an angel, I cannot understand.  {A place in which it is so easy to be good: p94.jpg}  Living with animals is really a very improving and wholesome kind of life, to the person who will allow himself to be influenced by their sensible and high-minded ideals.  When you come to think about it, man is really the only animal that ever makes a fool of himself; the others are highly civilised, and never make mistakes.  I am going to mention this when I write to somebody, sometime; I mean if I ever do.  To be sure, our human life is much more complicated than theirs, and I believe when the other animals notice our errors of judgment they make allowances.  The bee is as busy as a bee, and the beaver works like a beaver, but there their responsibility ends.  The bee doesn't have to go about seeing that other bees are not crowded into unsanitary tenements or victimised by the sweating system.  When the beaver's day of toil is over he doesn't have to discuss the sphere, the rights, or the voting privileges of beaveresses; all he has to do is to work like a beaver, and that is comparatively simple.     CHAPTER XIII   {Not particularly attracted by the poultry: p96.jpg}  I have been studying _The Young Poultry Keeper's Friend_ of late.  If there is anything I dislike and deplore, it is the possession of knowledge which I cannot put to practical use.  Having discovered an interesting disease called Scaly Leg in the July number, I took the magazine out into the poultry-yard and identified the malady on three hens and a cock.  Phoebe joined me in the diagnosis and we treated the victims with a carbolic lotion and scrubbed them with vaseline.  {Leaned languidly against the netting: p97.jpg}  As Phoebe and I grow wise in medical lore the case of Cannibal Ann assumes a different aspect.  As the bibulous man quaffs more and more flagons of beer and wine when his daily food is ham, salt fish, and cabbage, so does the hen avenge her wrongs of diet and woes of environment.  Cannibal Ann, herself, has, so far as we know, been raised in a Christian manner and enjoyed all the advantages of modern methods; but her maternal parent may have lived in some heathen poultry-yard which was asphalted or bricked or flagged, so that she was debarred from scratching in Mother Earth and was forced to eat her own shells in self- defence.  * * * * *  The Square Baby is not particularly attracted by the poultry as a whole, save when it is boiled with bacon or roasted with bread-sauce; but he is much interested in the \"invaleeds.\"  Whenever Phoebe and I start for the hospital with the tobacco-pills, the tin of paraffin, and the bottle of oil, he is very much in evidence.  Perhaps he has a natural leaning toward the medical profession; at any rate, when pain and anguish wring the brow, he is in close attendance upon the ministering angels.  {Staggered and reeled: p98.jpg}  Now it is necessary for the physician to have practice as well as theory, so the Square Baby, being left to himself this afternoon, proceeded to perfect himself in some of the healing arts used by country practitioners.  {Caught her son red-handed: p99.jpg}  When discovered, he was seated in front of the wire-covered \"run\" attached to a coop occupied by the youngest goslings.  A couple of bottles and a box stood by his side, and I should think he had administered a cup of sweet oil, a pint of paraffin, and a quarter of a pound of tobacco during his clinic.  He had used the remedies impartially, sometimes giving the paraffin internally and rubbing the patient's head with tobacco or oil, sometimes the reverse.  Several goslings leaned languidly against the netting, or supported themselves by the edge of the water-dish, while others staggered and reeled about with eyes half closed.  {He was treated summarily and smartly: p100.jpg}  It was Mrs. Heaven who caught her son red-handed, so to speak.  She was dressed in her best, and just driving off to Woodmucket to spend a day or two with her married daughter, and soothe her nerves with the uproar incident to a town of six hundred inhabitants.  She delayed her journey a half-hour--long enough, in fact, to change her black silk waist for a loose sacque which would give her arms full and comfortable play.

I'll find a few coppers somewhere,\" replied the boy, trying to speak cheerfully, although in his heart he also had not the slightest idea in which direction to turn.  The winter had been a hard one: extreme cold, deep snow, and violent winds. The Wang house had suffered greatly. The roof had fallen in, weighed down by heavy snow. Then a hurricane had blown a wall over, and Ming-li, the son, up all night and exposed to a bitter cold wind, had caught pneumonia. Long days of illness followed, with the spending of extra money for medicine. All their scant savings had soon melted away, and at the shop where Ming-li had been employed his place was filled by another. When at last he arose from his sick-bed he was too weak for hard labour and there seemed to be no work in the neighbouring villages for him to do. Night after night he came home, trying not to be discouraged, but in his heart feeling the deep pangs of sorrow that come to the good son who sees his mother suffering for want of food and clothing.  \"Bless his good heart!\" said the poor widow after he had gone. \"No mother ever had a better boy. I hope he is right in saying the gods will provide. It has been getting so much worse these past few weeks that it seems now as if my stomach were as empty as a rich man's brain. Why, even the rats have deserted our cottage, and there's nothing left for poor Tabby, while old Blackfoot is nearly dead from starvation.\"  When the old woman referred to the sorrows of her pets, her remarks were answered by a pitiful mewing and woebegone barking from the corner where the two unfed creatures were curled up together trying to keep warm.  Just then there was a loud knocking at the gate. When the widow Wang called out, \"Come in!\" she was surprised to see an old bald-headed priest standing in the doorway. \"Sorry, but we have nothing,\" she went on, feeling sure the visitor had come in search of food. \"We have fed on scraps these two weeks--on scraps and scrapings--and now we are living on the memories of what we used to have when my son's father was living. Our cat was so fat she couldn't climb to the roof. Now look at her. You can hardly see her, she's so thin. No, I'm sorry we can't help you, friend priest, but you see how it is.\"  \"I didn't come for alms,\" cried the clean-shaven one, looking at her kindly, \"but only to see what I could do to help you. The gods have listened long to the prayers of your devoted son. They honour him because he has not waited till you die to do sacrifice for you. They have seen how faithfully he has served you ever since his illness, and now, when he is worn out and unable to work, they are resolved to reward him for his virtue. You likewise have been a good mother and shall receive the gift I am now bringing.\"  \"What do you mean?\" faltered Mrs. Wang, hardly believing her ears at hearing a priest speak of bestowing mercies. \"Have you come here to laugh at our misfortunes?\"  \"By no means. Here in my hand I hold a tiny golden beetle which you will find has a magic power greater than any you ever dreamed of. I will leave this precious thing with you, a present from the god of filial conduct.\"  \"Yes, it will sell for a good sum,\" murmured the other, looking closely at the trinket, \"and will give us millet for several days. Thanks, good priest, for your kindness.\"  \"But you must by no means sell this golden beetle, for it has the power to fill your stomachs as long as you live.\"  The widow stared in open-mouthed wonder at the priest's surprising words.  \"Yes, you must not doubt me, but listen carefully to what I tell you. Whenever you wish food, you have only to place this ornament in a kettle of boiling water, saying over and over again the names of what you want to eat. In three minutes take off the lid, and there will be your dinner, smoking hot, and cooked more perfectly than any food you have ever eaten.\"  \"May I try it now?\" she asked eagerly.  \"As soon as I am gone.\"  When the door was shut, the old woman hurriedly kindled a fire, boiled some water, and then dropped in the golden beetle, repeating these words again and again:     \"Dumplings, dumplings, come to me,    I am thin as thin can be.    Dumplings, dumplings, smoking hot,    Dumplings, dumplings, fill the pot.\"   Would those three minutes never pass? Could the priest have told the truth? Her old head was nearly wild with excitement as clouds of steam rose from the kettle. Off came the lid! She could wait no longer. Wonder of wonders! There before her unbelieving eyes was a pot, full to the brim of pork dumplings, dancing up and down in the bubbling water, the best, the most delicious dumplings she had ever tasted. She ate and ate till there was no room left in her greedy stomach, and then she feasted the cat and the dog until they were ready to burst.  \"Good fortune has come at last,\" whispered Blackfoot, the dog, to Whitehead, the cat, as they lay down to sun themselves outside. \"I fear I couldn't have held out another week without running away to look for food. I don't know just what's happened, but there's no use questioning the gods.\"  Mrs. Wang fairly danced for joy at the thought of her son's return and of how she would feast him.  \"Poor boy, how surprised he will be at our fortune--and it's all on account of his goodness to his old mother.\"  When Ming-li came, with a dark cloud overhanging his brow, the widow saw plainly that disappointment was written there.  \"Come, come, lad!\" she cried cheerily, \"clear up your face and smile, for the gods have been good to us and I shall soon show you how richly your devotion has been rewarded.\" So saying, she dropped the golden beetle into the boiling water and stirred up the fire.  Thinking his mother had gone stark mad for want of food, Ming-li stared solemnly at her. Anything was preferable to this misery. Should he sell his last outer garment for a few pennies and buy millet for her? Blackfoot licked his hand comfortingly, as if to say, \"Cheer up, master, fortune has turned in our favour.\" Whitehead leaped upon a bench, purring like a sawmill.  Ming-li did not have long to wait. Almost in the twinkling of an eye he heard his mother crying out,  \"Sit down at the table, son, and eat these dumplings while they are smoking hot.\"  Could he have heard correctly? Did his ears deceive him? No, there on the table was a huge platter full of the delicious pork dumplings he liked better than anything else in all the world, except, of course, his mother.  \"Eat and ask no questions,\" counselled the Widow Wang. \"When you are satisfied I will tell you everything.\"  Wise advice! Very soon the young man's chopsticks were twinkling like a little star in the verses. He ate long and happily, while his good mother"]]]
