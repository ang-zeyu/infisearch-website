But now they've got to fight France and Russia too.  And the only chance they have is to beat France even more quickly than they did in 1870.  I happen to know that their plans require them to capture Paris within six weeks.\"  \"Six weeks!  Do you think they can do it?\"  \"No!  Not if we do our part!  And if they don't, they're likely to fail altogether.  Because then Russia will have had time to mobilize, and more than half of the German army will have to help the Austrians to hold back the Russians from Vienna and Berlin.  What they're counting on, you see, is smashing France, so that they can hold only a few corps back on this side, and throw all the rest of their army against Russia. Then they'd have a chance--more than a chance.\"  \"But still I don't understand about Liege yet, and why it's so important,\" said Arthur.  \"I'm coming to that.  Now, to get at the French, they've got to go through Belgium.  Well, they've got to supply their armies.  They've got to send guns, and ammunition, and food from Germany.  To do that they have to keep their line of communication open.  Liege is right on one of their important lines of communication--the one that really starts at Aix-la-Chapelle, just across the border.  Liege, if it wasn't reduced, or at least 'masked'--that means surrounded--would threaten these communications all the time.  We could raid the railway, for instance.  And if communications are interrupted, even for a day or so, it may mean the loss of a battle.  They use a frightful lot of ammunition, for instance, in a modern battle.  And if troops didn't get their supplies, they might be crushed utterly.  That's why we'll hold them back.\"  Meanwhile the armored car was approaching Liege.  And now they were near the old citadel, where, as both the scouts knew, General Leman had established his headquarters.  \"I don't know whether the General will see you,\" said a captain, doubtfully.  \"But you can see one of his staff, anyway.  Won't that do? He can decide whether what you have is important.\"  \"Yes, and I think he'll take us to the General when he hears our story,\" said Paul.  \"But please hurry!  There really isn't any time to be lost.\"  \"I'll speak to Major du Chaillu,\" promised the captain.  \"I think he'll be able to arrange matters for you.\"  After a short delay, Major du Chaillu, a tall, harassed looking man, under whose eyes there were great, dark circles as if he had not slept for many weary hours, received them in his office.  He was busy with a great map of Liege and the surrounding forts, on which he was arranging and rearranging many small flags.  \"Now tell me briefly what you have discovered,\" he said, his manner quick and abrupt.  It was plain that exhaustion had made him nervous.  \"We have found out that the Germans have secretly prepared foundations for heavy guns all around Liege, sir,\" said Paul, quietly.  \"What?\"  The major spun around and stared at them.  Paul repeated the statement, and produced the packet of papers they had gone through so much to retain.  \"We didn't know what these marks meant,\" he explained.  \"So we decided to try to find out.  And when we reached the place that was marked on this map we found not only a concrete and steel foundation for a big gun, but some smaller guns, all ready to be assembled and a store of ammunition.\"  \"Tell me exactly what happened,\" said du Chaillu.  But already he was comparing the sketch maps Paul had given him with his own big wall map, and was using his compasses and other instruments to determine ranges and distances.  His eyes were shining, too.  Busy as he was, however, he listened attentively.  \"That was well done--well done, indeed!\" he said, heartily.  \"You will hear more of this, I promise you, and from those whose praise will mean more than anything I can say.  I shall take you at once to General Leman, although there are positive orders that he is not to be disturbed.\"  And so in a few minutes they found themselves in the presence of the heroic defender of Liege, the kindly faced, middle aged general who was to win a European, a world-wide reputation, indeed, in the course of the next few days.  He heard du Chaillu's report; then he questioned both the scouts.  \"You have served Belgium well to-day,\" he said, finally.  \"I shall report your conduct to His Majesty the King.  Major, see to it that these boys reach their homes in safety, and if an escort is needed, or any other help, to enable them and their relatives to reach a place of safety, supply it.  I shall see you again, I hope, my boys!\"  \"What we discovered will really prove useful, then?\" asked Paul, when, with the major, they had left General Leman.  \"Useful?\" exclaimed the major.  \"Eh--but yes!  Listen!  What you have found is the location of all the heavy guns that will soon be thundering at our brave forts.  Now we shall know just where those guns are.  We can give the gunners the exact range, the exact spot at which to drop their shells.  We shall put their heavy pieces out of business. Do you see?  If you had not brought us this word we might have wasted many shots trying to do that.  We should have sent up aeroplanes, we should have guessed by the smoke and the reports just where their guns were placed.  But now we need not guess; we need risk nothing to learn the truth.  We know it in advance.\"  \"I was hoping there would be time to send men to destroy such places as we found,\" said Arthur.  \"There might be time, but it is far better not to do so, you see,\" said the major.  \"As it is, we could destroy only the mountings.  But if we wait until their guns are in position, we can smash the guns as well. It may well be that you have dealt a blow to Germany to-night more severe than the loss of a battle and fifty thousand men would be!\"  \"I hope so!\" said Arthur, vindictively.  \"They have no business coming into peaceful Belgium, which asks only to be left alone!\"  The major laughed a little bitterly.  \"That is true,\" he said.  \"But our poor Belgium!  They call her the cockpit of Europe, for whenever there is a general war, it is here in Belgium and in Flanders, both French and Belgian, that the fighting is at its fiercest, it seems.  Marlborough fought Louis the Fourteenth here; it was near Brussels that Wellington crushed Napoleon.  Blood and fire have been known in Belgium always.  But perhaps after this war our neutrality will no longer be but a word.  It may be that we shall be able to cease to think of danger then.\"  Outside there was a sudden bustle.  Officers were running about, forgetful of their dignity.  From the room in which they had left General Leman there was a constant double stream of officers and orderlies, one going in, the other coming out.  Major du Chaillu looked startled.  \"There must be something new!\" he said.  \"Wait for me a minute--I will find out.\"  When he returned his face was very grave.  \"A German army corps has occupied Luxembourg, against the formal protest of the Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide,\" he said.  \"And Belgian soil has felt the footprints of armed Germans at last!  What we have known must come has come!  The German invasion of Belgium has begun!\"  \"That means war,\" said Paul.  \"Yes.  I am afraid that we shall be fighting them within twenty-four hours.  They will move swiftly.  You had better hasten back to your home.  If there are no men left there you may be badly needed.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said Paul.  \"I hope, though, that we may be of some service during the defence, after we have done what is necessary for my aunt.\"  \"We shall see as to that later,\" said du Chaillu.  \"You have been of the greatest service to Belgium already.  I shall order an escort for you.\"  \"Please don't,\" said Paul.  \"We can get along all right.  There can be no danger now.  And I believe that every man in the garrison here will be needed.\"  \"Well--\"  Du Chaillu hesitated.  \"Perhaps you are right.  I myself cannot see of what use an armed escort can be to you.  There is not the slightest real chance of any trouble between here and your home.  Good luck to you--and may we meet again in a time when our anxieties and our fears for our country shall be at an end!\"  \"Good-bye, sir, and thank you!\" said Paul and Arthur together.  In the town they got bicycles at a place where they were well known. Du Chaillu had given them the countersign, and they needed it near Boncelles, since they were challenged.  They rode swiftly along, and as they neared the house, they saw a bright glare in the sky.     CHAPTER VII  THE FIRE  \"That's from a fire, Paul!\" said Arthur.  \"And it looks--\"  \"As if it came from Uncle Henri's house?  It certainly does, Arthur!  Oh, but I hope it isn't! That would be dreadful!\"  They raced on now, and as they hastened, the sky before them grew ever brighter.  They could no longer doubt that the glare they saw came from a conflagration, and it grew more and more certain every minute that it was their own summer home that was burning.  There was no other house in that direction that would produce such a splendid reflection were it afire.  And soon, too, they came in sight of the house, and all hope that they were mistaken vanished. It was M. de Frenard's house, and a single glance showed that there was no hope of saving it. Flames were spurting from every window, and through the roof, even as they came into plain sight of the house, there burst a great pillar of fire.  There seemed to be an explosion of some sort, for a great mass of sparks shot upward toward the heavens, raining down a moment later.  In the light of the fire they could see the men-servants and some of the peasant neighbors busily engaged in dragging a few pieces of furniture and some pictures across the lawn--evidently what little there had been time to drag from the burning house.  They could see also a group of women, where Madame de Frenard was calming the women-servants and trying to bring order"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18838"],["title","The Belgians to the Front (#7)"],["body","of chaos.  Dropping their bicycles, they ran quickly toward her, calling her name.  As she heard them she turned, and they saw that her face was radiant.  \"Oh, you are safe, then!\" she cried.  \"Now nothing else matters, since no one is hurt!  No one had seen you two since dinner--I was so frightened!\"  \"We're all right,\" said Paul, a little remorseful. \"There was something we had to do, that I will tell you about later.  But how did this fire start?\"  \"No one knows,\" said Madame de Frenard, her eyes darkening.  \"All that is certain is that we were awakened by a cry of fire.  There was scarcely time for all of us to get out, and for the men to save a few of the best pictures.  It seemed that oil must have been spread about, for the fire to burn so quickly!  I do not believe it was an accident.\"  Paul and Arthur looked at one another.  The same thought had come to both of them.  It was Arthur who voiced it.  \"The Germans?\" he said, doubtfully.  \"Just what I was wondering,\" said Paul.  \"But why should they?\"  \"Oh, I thought of them, too!\" said their aunt. \"And I, too, asked why.  There is war but, even so, we have nothing to do with that.  There is no reason for them to burn our home!\"  \"I think a great many things are going to happen for which it will be hard to find a reason,\" said Paul, thoughtfully.  \"Well, the first thing to be done is for us to get a roof over our heads for to-night,\" said Madame de Frenard, with decision.  \"Your uncle is still in Brussels, unless he has already rejoined the army.  I think we had better go into Liege and stay at a hotel.\"  \"We can get into Liege,\" said Paul, rousing himself from his mood of reflection, \"but I'm not sure about staying there.  I think you had better take your maid and go to Brussels, Aunt Claire. The rest of the servants ought to go home, I think.\"  It was curious to see how their positions were reversed in this emergency.  It was Paul who was in command now, not his aunt.  \"Do you think so?\" she said.  \"Why, Paul?\"  \"Because I am afraid that there will be hard fighting around Liege.  I do not think the town will be defended for very long; it cannot be.  It is supposed only to check the German advance, to gain a little time, so that the French and the English, if they come to our aid, may have time to mass their troops to the west and the north.  I am sure Uncle Henri would say I was right, and I can arrange it for you to be sent to Brussels, I am sure.\"  Madame de Frenard was a little inclined to smile, in spite of the fire and all the woe it had brought with it.  \"Why, Paul, how can you arrange anything?\" she asked.  \"Have you, perhaps, suddenly acquired influence with the army?\"  \"He certainly has!\" interrupted Arthur, his eyes shining.  \"Oh, Aunt Claire, we've done so many wonderful things to-night!\"  So he let the cat out of the bag, and, with so much of a start, Madame de Frenard was not satisfied until she had the whole story out of them. She caught her breath when she heard of the shots that had been fired at them, but she looked very proud and happy, too.  \"Oh, that was splendid!\" she cried.  \"We may be a little nation, we Belgians, but we can meet them when even our boys can defy them and outwit them so magnificently!  Now I know that I can trust you!  Paul, it is as if your uncle were here! You shall take his place, and I shall do whatever you say is right.\"  Paul grew red, and embarrassment checked his speech for a moment.  \"It was just luck, of course,\" he said, confusedly. \"Anyone could have done what we did, you know.  But I'm glad you'll go on to Brussels, Aunt Claire, and I think Major du Chaillu will be glad to make the arrangements, before the railway is interrupted.  I will go now and get out the carriages.\"  \"Very well, Paul, do so.  It is lucky that we have those left, at any rate.\"  Paul and Arthur helped the men to get out the carriages and harness the horses, frightened by the noise and confusion of the fire.  And Paul and Arthur, too, rode in the carriage that took their aunt and her maid into Liege.  \"I didn't think we would be coming back to Liege quite so soon,\" said Arthur, a little ruefully. \"This isn't as exciting as the first trip we made to-night, either.\"  \"No, but I think it's safer,\" said Paul, rather dryly.  \"And there'll be more than enough excitement to make up for it when the Germans come, Arthur.\"  \"Oh, I suppose so!\"  \"I am going to take you two boys to Brussels with me,\" said Madame de Frenard, suddenly.  Paul was quiet at that; it was Arthur who cried out in vigorous protest.  \"Oh, no, Aunt Claire!\" he exclaimed.  \"There's so much for us to do here!\"  \"There will be plenty for you to do in Brussels,\" she said, with decision.  \"It's settled.  I can't allow you to stay here if it isn't safe for me.\"  Arthur looked to Paul for help, but Paul only smiled.  His aunt looked at him curiously.  \"So you are willing to go without arguing, Paul?\" she asked.  \"You said it was settled, Aunt Claire,\" he replied.  \"If a thing is settled, there is no use in arguing about it, is there?\"  She smiled faintly.  She knew Paul well enough to know that when his mind was made up he never was willing to admit that a thing was settled until it was settled as he wished.  She wondered what he had up his sleeve, for she was sure that he was quite as anxious as Arthur to stay in or around Liege.  As a matter of fact, Paul was the only one of them all who had even a remote idea of what was coming.  He could not foresee all the horrors of invasion and battle.  No one can do that, or wars would never be begun.  But he did realize that dire trouble was in store, and that a good many civilians, and especially women and young children, would be sent away from Liege before there was any fighting, if that were possible.  There was something else that Paul grasped better than either Arthur and his aunt, and that was the probable course of the invasion.  He knew that in a few days Liege, strong fortress though it was, would be engulfed.  It might hold out for a long time; he thought it probably would.  But the Germans would be all about it. The Uhlans would sweep along, far beyond the range of the guns of the forts, cutting communications, interrupting railways, blocking the roads, and Liege must depend upon itself for food, for ammunition, for all the things that would be needed.  For that reason, he thought, General Leman would encourage all who could to get out of the city before the actual siege began.  And he had an idea that there was no real question of his going, or Arthur; that they would have to wait their turn, at least.  That was why he submitted so quietly to his aunt's declaration that he and Arthur were to go with her.  When they arrived in Liege he found that, late as it was, the city was still awake and stirring. Outside of the railway station there was a great crowd.  There were women there with children clinging to their skirts.  They carried odd-shaped bundles.  Plainly this was a sudden flight for most of them, and they had snatched up their greatest treasures, and wrapped them as best they could.'  \"Why, it looks like a regular panic!\" said Madame de Frenard.  \"I don't see what there is to be afraid of yet, at any rate.  I don't see how we are going to get away, either, Paul.\"  \"I'll try to find Major du Chaillu,\" said Paul. \"Arthur, will you stay here while I go?\"  He went off when Arthur nodded, and threaded his way through the confusion and the crowds to General Leman's headquarters.  There, after a good deal of difficulty, and after he had been turned away several times by impatient sentries, he succeeded in finding his friend the major.  To him he explained the situation.  \"Your aunt and her maid?\" said du Chaillu. \"Yes, I shall be able to manage that.\"  \"My cousin and I cannot go, I suppose?\"  \"Not to-night, I'm afraid, my boy.  The orders are very strict.\"  He looked a little puzzled, but went on: \"I'd like to make an exception in your case, for you have done so much for Belgium--\"  \"Oh, I don't want to go and neither does Arthur!\" cried Paul, with a laugh.  \"It's just as I thought.  Only my aunt wants us to go, and I was afraid that perhaps we could.\"  The major laughed, too.  \"That's more like what I had expected from you,\" he said.  \"Yet it would be better if you did go.  However, women and children first.  We've made the rule, and we must make no exceptions, or it would be impossible to enforce it at all.\"  \"Oh, we'll get along all right,\" said Paul. \"And--well, I have an idea that may not be of any use, so that I'd better not say anything about it yet.  But I hope that Paul and I can still do something for Belgium and Liege.\"  \"I've no doubt that you will try to do that,\" said du Chaillu.  \"Come, show me where you left your aunt, and I will see that she is allowed to go out on the next train.  I will take her into the station by a private entrance for there is little chance of getting through the crowd in any other way.\"  He was as good as his word.  Madame de Frenard listened to his explanation of how impossible it was for Paul and Arthur to be allowed to go on the train, and glanced at Paul.  She thought that she understood his submissiveness better now!  \"But--women and children?\" she said. \"Surely these boys?\"  \"We are not children!\" protested Paul and Arthur in one breath.  Major du Chaillu smiled rather sadly.  \"No, they are not children in such times as these, Madame,\" he said.  \"We have not quite come to the point of calling upon boys to fight, but we cannot treat them as children.  Still, I shall see that they are looked to, as well as I can, be assured of that, Madame de Frenard.\"  And with that assurance she had to be content.     CHAPTER VIII  THE UHLAN  \"Come along with me,\" said du Chaillu, when they had left Madame de Frenard in the station.  \"I'll see that you're put up for the rest of the night, and to-morrow we'll make other arrangements.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Paul, \"but I think we'd better go back."]]]
